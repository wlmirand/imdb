    I think this movie is highly underrated. Being a kid from parents who divorced (and thankfully, my dad only came around once after he abandoned us), I can totally relate to these characters. Paul Reiser is wonderful. Randy Quaid is outrageous! Matthew Modine is the quintessential guy... And the kids are utterly typical and crazy! And of course, the radio doc? Insane. This movie must be watched again and again to be appreciated--and those who say it's a crappy movie have not seen it. If you want a boring movie, this is NOT it. This movie is by turns funny, sad, outrageous and will make you laugh hysterically, cry, and pull your hair in frustration or say: "ha! I'd do that too!" The insults between the exes fly unabated, but they're classy insults. And while you would totally pull a stunt like the several shown in the movie, be grateful if you have a civil divorce. As this movie demonstrates--divorce can totally stink. And so can dating after your divorce. P.S. Jeanine Garofalo is outrageously funny!

    Watched this on cable and found it a good relevant comedy with laugh out loud moments and some touching parts. This is a realistic and witty look at divorce from the man's point of view. The dialog isn't dated at all even though it's about 16 years old and it's better and more meaningful than some of the silly comedies they make nowadays. Good screenplay that avoids clich&eacute;s. Even though there are quite a few characters: ex wives, girlfriends and kids it isn't confusing. The cast is likable Paul Reiser, Matthew Modine and Randy Quaid. Randy shows a lot more range than he usually gets to show. A young Eliza Dushku plays one of the daughters. Amy Brenneman plays one of the ex wives. Watch out for a brief shot of Jack Black. Overall a pleasant feel good comedy about divorce. Watch it.

    This film really explores the roles that children and fathers are placed in after divorce. It is far more than a comedy as it explores some of the situations and feelings that are present in the divorced family that includes kids. This is a truly likable, wonderfully enjoyable, fun movie with enough comedy to make it laughable, but enough perspective to make a someone examine the roles of a family before and after divorce. This movie is a true keeper for our family. We watch it about 3 times a year. Highly recommended in my opinion.

    This movie is a good example that all men should stay single in America. Its about three single dads (Matthew Modine, Randy Quaid and Paul Reiser)who meet every weekend at the local Mcdonalds to pick up their kids from their ex-wives. They are shown going through the hardships of being single dads and dealing with their former wives spending the child support money on things other than the kids. The ex-wives are correctly shown I feel of how women in America have the upper hand in divorce, as them being first, kids second ex husbands last. Aside from that this film sucks. The three men in this movie are nothing but a bunch of wimps who need to grow up but instead sit through the whole film complaining about who their ex-wives may be seeing, dealing with their own incapacity with seeing new women and how to talk to their children. I know this film comes off as a light hearted comedy but it got no laughs from me. The one thing it does show correctly is what marriage has become in America these days. How selfish grown-ups can be and that kids in marriage are nothing more than part of the deal...Ya know we have a house, two cars, cat and dog and now we need kids. If it does not work than oh well cause its all about me after all. The date scene in the restaurant between Quiad and Janeane Garofalo is so poorly written as to be embarrassing. She was the date from hell that could not make up her mind about what she wanted to order and by the time the scene ended I was so exhausted I wanted to scream. Janeane Garofalo character served no useful purpose except to irritate the audience. She was poorly mis-cast. Stay single guys*** This has to be the longest product placement(Mcdonalds)in film history

    Dave (Matthew Modine), Vic (Randy Quaid), and Donny (Paul Reiser) are a trio of friends and divorced fathers. Dave has a beautiful new young girlfriend named Kim (Maria Pitillo) but still sports a wandering eye. Vic, whose soul was definitely bruised by his ex-wife, is just agreeing to go on a blind date with Lucille (Janeane Garofalo). As for Donny (Paul Reiser), he is also having severe trouble moving on, holding his former wife in high esteem, even though she has remarried. All of the men have children that they love deeply and who fall into their custody at the appropriate times. Yet, meeting their former mates at such places as McDonald's, in order to exchange their children, still gives everyone a pang of hurt. Will Dave learn to commit himself to one woman? Will Vic let go of his resentments and take a chance on a new love? And will Donny realize his ex is never coming back and give himself permission to love someone else, even if it is Dave's former wife (Amy Brenneman)? As for the kids, will they be able to weather their parents divorce, too? This is a truthful and touching film about divorce in modern America. Yes, it is very common now, making life complicated, especially when children are involved. But, even so, it is not the end of the world, as all of the men, women, and kids discover in this movie. All of the actors are wonderful, with Quaid, especially, giving an extremely humorous and thoughtful performance. Special mention should also go to Garofalo for her drop-dead-funny, neurotic-yet-lovable portrayal of a divorc&eacute;e. Then, too, the California setting is lovely, the costumes very well chosen, and the production values quite high. Most of all, the script is funny, original, and brutally honest. If you have been down the divorce highway, you should definitely make time for this film. It will help heal wounds with its laughs and sensitivity. But, even if you just want to find a film that will let you "yuck it up", this one is a terrific choice.

    I really enjoyed Bye Bye Love. While many films have been done to death about divorced families and the trials and tribulations of their ex-spouses and kids, Bye Bye Love creates a very realistic chemistry of bickering couples, couples who still love each other, and single dads who have trouble dealing with divorce in multi-dimensional ways. It's all there: The day planning, the little league games, the dates, where everything that can go wrong often does go wrong. Mix all of this with the loud kids and spouses! Many people can deal with these issues in their own dysfunctional families. Watch for the best scene in the movie, where one of the Dad's has a "Date from Hell" at an Italian restaurant! Some critics and reviews have negatively discussed how the film personifies McDonald's as an "ad endorsement" for the fast-food chain. But, I didn't see this at all. Many people of divorced families will often meet at a fast food place for lunch or dinner to talk about their issues with their spouses and kids. Another element to the realism of the movie. The only minor downfall is that the ending is a little too pat and preachy with the "Just love your kids" routine. But there are many strong subplots and situations that anyone going through a divorce can understand. I recommend this movie. You might find something in it if you are going through a divorce, especially with kids involved, that you can relate to it in your own life. I always made a point to watch Bye Bye Love whenever it is on. Now I can watch the movie anytime I want. I own the DVD, and learn something new from the movie after each subsequent viewing.

    Y'know when I first saw this I thought it was very TV movie-ish and pretty stupid. It has grown on me since then, now I may tune in and stay awhile when it comes across the screen. Film focuses on three very different male friends, each coping with divorce and juggling kids and romance as best they can. There's a ton of then- and future-notables out there -- among others, we get treated to an absolutely stunning Brenneman and future looker Dushku as Reiser's troubled teen. Ed Flanders in his last film is superb as a oldtimer who just enjoys hanging a little with the kids. The closing credit wrap-up has been overdone but it plays very well in the finale of this one. Can't explain the lousy IMDb ratings, this movie deserves better.

    Janeane Garafalo and Randy Quaid are the only bright spots in this flick. Ed Flanders (in his last role) has some good moments, but is basically wasted. It was hard to feel much empathy for the "victimized" children of divorce here. "Ben," the screen son of Matthew Modine's character, needed his butt torn off and his mouth nailed shut in my opinion. And "Emma," the screen daughter of Paul Reiser's character, was nothing but a spoiled, miserable brat. She could have used a trip on the clue bus to the land of reality. Randy Quaid's kids were actually kind of cute. Maybe because Randy Quaid's character was more believable as a father than those of either of his co-stars.

    I loved this movie originally, its just so cute to watch the fathers and their kids relate with one another. Then the film was made even better when I realized that 3 of the actresses would later be on the WB/UPN's Buffy the Vampire Slayer.(My favorite show of all times.) Eliza Dushku (who plays Paul Reiser's daughter) starred in the recurring role of Faith, Amber Benson (Who plays Denis Quaid's daughter) would join the cast as Willow's girlfriend Tara, and Lindsay Crouse, who plays Vic (Dennis Quaid's) ex-wife in the film, would then guest stars as the psychotic Prof. Maggie Walsh. But even without that fact it was still a really great film. There are also a few other future stars in this as well.

    Divorce is a pervasive fact of life in our society. The three men at the center of the story, Vic, Donny, and Dave, have recently been divorced. It appears that all three have gone through friendly separations, as in all three cases, children are involved. Since the kids are under the mother's custody, the fathers have the right to get them for week-end visits. All three friends seem somewhat adjusted to their new realities. Vic, looks as the most grounded man of the trio. Donny, is the saddest case, and Dave, who is a wishy washy man, is trying his hand at a new relationship with a much younger woman. The wives, on the other hand, have moved on with their lives. The three women appear to have no problems with their new status. The exchange of children occurs in a suburban McDonald's, a neutral territory. This is a type of "brand placing" that Hollywood films love to show. Fast food, alas, stands for an allegory of what's missing with most marriages these days when most families don't even share a meal together. There is also the talk radio personality who is in the air taking calls from divorced people and advising them what to do, yet, he doesn't even have a clue about what he is talking about; after all, he's been married five times! The acting is adequate. The best thing in the film is Randy Quaid, who as Vic, makes the most of his role. Janeane Garofalo appears as a date from hell, in a funny sequence. The ensemble cast does fine work under Sam Weisman's direction. The sad fact of this story is that all these children, we see in the film, will probably go through divorces in their own lives.

Paul Reiser is wonderful. Randy Quaid is outrageous! Matthew Modine is the quintessential guy... And the kids are utterly typical and crazy! And of course, the radio doc? Insane. This movie must be watched again and again to be appreciated--and those who say it's a crappy movie have not seen it. If you want a boring movie, this is NOT it. This movie is by turns funny, sad, outrageous and will make you laugh hysterically, cry, and pull your hair in frustration or say: "ha! I'd do that too!" The insults between the exes fly unabated, but they're classy insults. And while you would totally pull a stunt like the several shown in the movie, be grateful if you have a civil divorce. As this movie demonstrates--divorce can totally stink. And so can dating after your divorce. P.S. Jeanine Garofalo is outrageously funny!

    Watched this on cable and found it a good relevant comedy with laugh out loud moments and some touching parts. This is a realistic and witty look at divorce from the man's point of view. The dialog isn't dated at all even though it's about 16 years old and it's better and more meaningful than some of the silly comedies they make nowadays. Good screenplay that avoids clich&eacute;s. Even though there are quite a few characters: ex wives, girlfriends and kids it isn't confusing. The cast is likable Paul Reiser, Matthew Modine and Randy Quaid. Randy shows a lot more range than he usually gets to show. A young Eliza Dushku plays one of the daughters. Amy Brenneman plays one of the ex wives. Watch out for a brief shot of Jack Black. Overall a pleasant feel good comedy about divorce. Watch it.

    This film really explores the roles that children and fathers are placed in after divorce. It is far more than a comedy as it explores some of the situations and feelings that are present in the divorced family that includes kids. This is a truly likable, wonderfully enjoyable, fun movie with enough comedy to make it laughable, but enough perspective to make a someone examine the roles of a family before and after divorce. This movie is a true keeper for our family. We watch it about 3 times a year. Highly recommended in my opinion.

    This movie is a good example that all men should stay single in America. Its about three single dads (Matthew Modine, Randy Quaid and Paul Reiser)who meet every weekend at the local Mcdonalds to pick up their kids from their ex-wives. They are shown going through the hardships of being single dads and dealing with their former wives spending the child support money on things other than the kids. The ex-wives are correctly shown I feel of how women in America have the upper hand in divorce, as them being first, kids second ex husbands last. Aside from that this film sucks. The three men in this movie are nothing but a bunch of wimps who need to grow up but instead sit through the whole film complaining about who their ex-wives may be seeing, dealing with their own incapacity with seeing new women and how to talk to their children. I know this film comes off as a light hearted comedy but it got no laughs from me. The one thing it does show correctly is what marriage has become in America these days. How selfish grown-ups can be and that kids in marriage are nothing more than part of the deal...Ya know we have a house, two cars, cat and dog and now we need kids. If it does not work than oh well cause its all about me after all. The date scene in the restaurant between Quiad and Janeane Garofalo is so poorly written as to be embarrassing. She was the date from hell that could not make up her mind about what she wanted to order and by the time the scene ended I was so exhausted I wanted to scream. Janeane Garofalo character served no useful purpose except to irritate the audience. She was poorly mis-cast. Stay single guys*** This has to be the longest product placement(Mcdonalds)in film history

    Dave (Matthew Modine), Vic (Randy Quaid), and Donny (Paul Reiser) are a trio of friends and divorced fathers. Dave has a beautiful new young girlfriend named Kim (Maria Pitillo) but still sports a wandering eye. Vic, whose soul was definitely bruised by his ex-wife, is just agreeing to go on a blind date with Lucille (Janeane Garofalo). As for Donny (Paul Reiser), he is also having severe trouble moving on, holding his former wife in high esteem, even though she has remarried. All of the men have children that they love deeply and who fall into their custody at the appropriate times. Yet, meeting their former mates at such places as McDonald's, in order to exchange their children, still gives everyone a pang of hurt. Will Dave learn to commit himself to one woman? Will Vic let go of his resentments and take a chance on a new love? And will Donny realize his ex is never coming back and give himself permission to love someone else, even if it is Dave's former wife (Amy Brenneman)? As for the kids, will they be able to weather their parents divorce, too? This is a truthful and touching film about divorce in modern America. Yes, it is very common now, making life complicated, especially when children are involved. But, even so, it is not the end of the world, as all of the men, women, and kids discover in this movie. All of the actors are wonderful, with Quaid, especially, giving an extremely humorous and thoughtful performance. Special mention should also go to Garofalo for her drop-dead-funny, neurotic-yet-lovable portrayal of a divorc&eacute;e. Then, too, the California setting is lovely, the costumes very well chosen, and the production values quite high. Most of all, the script is funny, original, and brutally honest. If you have been down the divorce highway, you should definitely make time for this film. It will help heal wounds with its laughs and sensitivity. But, even if you just want to find a film that will let you "yuck it up", this one is a terrific choice.

    I really enjoyed Bye Bye Love. While many films have been done to death about divorced families and the trials and tribulations of their ex-spouses and kids, Bye Bye Love creates a very realistic chemistry of bickering couples, couples who still love each other, and single dads who have trouble dealing with divorce in multi-dimensional ways. It's all there: The day planning, the little league games, the dates, where everything that can go wrong often does go wrong. Mix all of this with the loud kids and spouses! Many people can deal with these issues in their own dysfunctional families. Watch for the best scene in the movie, where one of the Dad's has a "Date from Hell" at an Italian restaurant! Some critics and reviews have negatively discussed how the film personifies McDonald's as an "ad endorsement" for the fast-food chain. But, I didn't see this at all. Many people of divorced families will often meet at a fast food place for lunch or dinner to talk about their issues with their spouses and kids. Another element to the realism of the movie. The only minor downfall is that the ending is a little too pat and preachy with the "Just love your kids" routine. But there are many strong subplots and situations that anyone going through a divorce can understand. I recommend this movie. You might find something in it if you are going through a divorce, especially with kids involved, that you can relate to it in your own life. I always made a point to watch Bye Bye Love whenever it is on. Now I can watch the movie anytime I want. I own the DVD, and learn something new from the movie after each subsequent viewing.

    Y'know when I first saw this I thought it was very TV movie-ish and pretty stupid. It has grown on me since then, now I may tune in and stay awhile when it comes across the screen. Film focuses on three very different male friends, each coping with divorce and juggling kids and romance as best they can. There's a ton of then- and future-notables out there -- among others, we get treated to an absolutely stunning Brenneman and future looker Dushku as Reiser's troubled teen. Ed Flanders in his last film is superb as a oldtimer who just enjoys hanging a little with the kids. The closing credit wrap-up has been overdone but it plays very well in the finale of this one. Can't explain the lousy IMDb ratings, this movie deserves better.

    Janeane Garafalo and Randy Quaid are the only bright spots in this flick. Ed Flanders (in his last role) has some good moments, but is basically wasted. It was hard to feel much empathy for the "victimized" children of divorce here. "Ben," the screen son of Matthew Modine's character, needed his butt torn off and his mouth nailed shut in my opinion. And "Emma," the screen daughter of Paul Reiser's character, was nothing but a spoiled, miserable brat. She could have used a trip on the clue bus to the land of reality. Randy Quaid's kids were actually kind of cute. Maybe because Randy Quaid's character was more believable as a father than those of either of his co-stars.

    I loved this movie originally, its just so cute to watch the fathers and their kids relate with one another. Then the film was made even better when I realized that 3 of the actresses would later be on the WB/UPN's Buffy the Vampire Slayer.(My favorite show of all times.) Eliza Dushku (who plays Paul Reiser's daughter) starred in the recurring role of Faith, Amber Benson (Who plays Denis Quaid's daughter) would join the cast as Willow's girlfriend Tara, and Lindsay Crouse, who plays Vic (Dennis Quaid's) ex-wife in the film, would then guest stars as the psychotic Prof. Maggie Walsh. But even without that fact it was still a really great film. There are also a few other future stars in this as well.

    Divorce is a pervasive fact of life in our society. The three men at the center of the story, Vic, Donny, and Dave, have recently been divorced. It appears that all three have gone through friendly separations, as in all three cases, children are involved. Since the kids are under the mother's custody, the fathers have the right to get them for week-end visits. All three friends seem somewhat adjusted to their new realities. Vic, looks as the most grounded man of the trio. Donny, is the saddest case, and Dave, who is a wishy washy man, is trying his hand at a new relationship with a much younger woman. The wives, on the other hand, have moved on with their lives. The three women appear to have no problems with their new status. The exchange of children occurs in a suburban McDonald's, a neutral territory. This is a type of "brand placing" that Hollywood films love to show. Fast food, alas, stands for an allegory of what's missing with most marriages these days when most families don't even share a meal together. There is also the talk radio personality who is in the air taking calls from divorced people and advising them what to do, yet, he doesn't even have a clue about what he is talking about; after all, he's been married five times! The acting is adequate. The best thing in the film is Randy Quaid, who as Vic, makes the most of his role. Janeane Garofalo appears as a date from hell, in a funny sequence. The ensemble cast does fine work under Sam Weisman's direction. The sad fact of this story is that all these children, we see in the film, will probably go through divorces in their own lives.

    This film really explores the roles that children and fathers are placed in after divorce. It is far more than a comedy as it explores some of the situations and feelings that are present in the divorced family that includes kids. This is a truly likable, wonderfully enjoyable, fun movie with enough comedy to make it laughable, but enough perspective to make a someone examine the roles of a family before and after divorce. This movie is a true keeper for our family. We watch it about 3 times a year. Highly recommended in my opinion.

    This movie is a good example that all men should stay single in America. Its about three single dads (Matthew Modine, Randy Quaid and Paul Reiser)who meet every weekend at the local Mcdonalds to pick up their kids from their ex-wives. They are shown going through the hardships of being single dads and dealing with their former wives spending the child support money on things other than the kids. The ex-wives are correctly shown I feel of how women in America have the upper hand in divorce, as them being first, kids second ex husbands last. Aside from that this film sucks. The three men in this movie are nothing but a bunch of wimps who need to grow up but instead sit through the whole film complaining about who their ex-wives may be seeing, dealing with their own incapacity with seeing new women and how to talk to their children. I know this film comes off as a light hearted comedy but it got no laughs from me. The one thing it does show correctly is what marriage has become in America these days. How selfish grown-ups can be and that kids in marriage are nothing more than part of the deal...Ya know we have a house, two cars, cat and dog and now we need kids. If it does not work than oh well cause its all about me after all. The date scene in the restaurant between Quiad and Janeane Garofalo is so poorly written as to be embarrassing. She was the date from hell that could not make up her mind about what she wanted to order and by the time the scene ended I was so exhausted I wanted to scream. Janeane Garofalo character served no useful purpose except to irritate the audience. She was poorly mis-cast. Stay single guys*** This has to be the longest product placement(Mcdonalds)in film history

    Dave (Matthew Modine), Vic (Randy Quaid), and Donny (Paul Reiser) are a trio of friends and divorced fathers. Dave has a beautiful new young girlfriend named Kim (Maria Pitillo) but still sports a wandering eye. Vic, whose soul was definitely bruised by his ex-wife, is just agreeing to go on a blind date with Lucille (Janeane Garofalo). As for Donny (Paul Reiser), he is also having severe trouble moving on, holding his former wife in high esteem, even though she has remarried. All of the men have children that they love deeply and who fall into their custody at the appropriate times. Yet, meeting their former mates at such places as McDonald's, in order to exchange their children, still gives everyone a pang of hurt. Will Dave learn to commit himself to one woman? Will Vic let go of his resentments and take a chance on a new love? And will Donny realize his ex is never coming back and give himself permission to love someone else, even if it is Dave's former wife (Amy Brenneman)? As for the kids, will they be able to weather their parents divorce, too? This is a truthful and touching film about divorce in modern America. Yes, it is very common now, making life complicated, especially when children are involved. But, even so, it is not the end of the world, as all of the men, women, and kids discover in this movie. All of the actors are wonderful, with Quaid, especially, giving an extremely humorous and thoughtful performance. Special mention should also go to Garofalo for her drop-dead-funny, neurotic-yet-lovable portrayal of a divorc&eacute;e. Then, too, the California setting is lovely, the costumes very well chosen, and the production values quite high. Most of all, the script is funny, original, and brutally honest. If you have been down the divorce highway, you should definitely make time for this film. It will help heal wounds with its laughs and sensitivity. But, even if you just want to find a film that will let you "yuck it up", this one is a terrific choice.

    I really enjoyed Bye Bye Love. While many films have been done to death about divorced families and the trials and tribulations of their ex-spouses and kids, Bye Bye Love creates a very realistic chemistry of bickering couples, couples who still love each other, and single dads who have trouble dealing with divorce in multi-dimensional ways. It's all there: The day planning, the little league games, the dates, where everything that can go wrong often does go wrong. Mix all of this with the loud kids and spouses! Many people can deal with these issues in their own dysfunctional families. Watch for the best scene in the movie, where one of the Dad's has a "Date from Hell" at an Italian restaurant! Some critics and reviews have negatively discussed how the film personifies McDonald's as an "ad endorsement" for the fast-food chain. But, I didn't see this at all. Many people of divorced families will often meet at a fast food place for lunch or dinner to talk about their issues with their spouses and kids. Another element to the realism of the movie. The only minor downfall is that the ending is a little too pat and preachy with the "Just love your kids" routine. But there are many strong subplots and situations that anyone going through a divorce can understand. I recommend this movie. You might find something in it if you are going through a divorce, especially with kids involved, that you can relate to it in your own life. I always made a point to watch Bye Bye Love whenever it is on. Now I can watch the movie anytime I want. I own the DVD, and learn something new from the movie after each subsequent viewing.

    Y'know when I first saw this I thought it was very TV movie-ish and pretty stupid. It has grown on me since then, now I may tune in and stay awhile when it comes across the screen. Film focuses on three very different male friends, each coping with divorce and juggling kids and romance as best they can. There's a ton of then- and future-notables out there -- among others, we get treated to an absolutely stunning Brenneman and future looker Dushku as Reiser's troubled teen. Ed Flanders in his last film is superb as a oldtimer who just enjoys hanging a little with the kids. The closing credit wrap-up has been overdone but it plays very well in the finale of this one. Can't explain the lousy IMDb ratings, this movie deserves better.

    Janeane Garafalo and Randy Quaid are the only bright spots in this flick. Ed Flanders (in his last role) has some good moments, but is basically wasted. It was hard to feel much empathy for the "victimized" children of divorce here. "Ben," the screen son of Matthew Modine's character, needed his butt torn off and his mouth nailed shut in my opinion. And "Emma," the screen daughter of Paul Reiser's character, was nothing but a spoiled, miserable brat. She could have used a trip on the clue bus to the land of reality. Randy Quaid's kids were actually kind of cute. Maybe because Randy Quaid's character was more believable as a father than those of either of his co-stars.

    I loved this movie originally, its just so cute to watch the fathers and their kids relate with one another. Then the film was made even better when I realized that 3 of the actresses would later be on the WB/UPN's Buffy the Vampire Slayer.(My favorite show of all times.) Eliza Dushku (who plays Paul Reiser's daughter) starred in the recurring role of Faith, Amber Benson (Who plays Denis Quaid's daughter) would join the cast as Willow's girlfriend Tara, and Lindsay Crouse, who plays Vic (Dennis Quaid's) ex-wife in the film, would then guest stars as the psychotic Prof. Maggie Walsh. But even without that fact it was still a really great film. There are also a few other future stars in this as well.

    Divorce is a pervasive fact of life in our society. The three men at the center of the story, Vic, Donny, and Dave, have recently been divorced. It appears that all three have gone through friendly separations, as in all three cases, children are involved. Since the kids are under the mother's custody, the fathers have the right to get them for week-end visits. All three friends seem somewhat adjusted to their new realities. Vic, looks as the most grounded man of the trio. Donny, is the saddest case, and Dave, who is a wishy washy man, is trying his hand at a new relationship with a much younger woman. The wives, on the other hand, have moved on with their lives. The three women appear to have no problems with their new status. The exchange of children occurs in a suburban McDonald's, a neutral territory. This is a type of "brand placing" that Hollywood films love to show. Fast food, alas, stands for an allegory of what's missing with most marriages these days when most families don't even share a meal together. There is also the talk radio personality who is in the air taking calls from divorced people and advising them what to do, yet, he doesn't even have a clue about what he is talking about; after all, he's been married five times! The acting is adequate. The best thing in the film is Randy Quaid, who as Vic, makes the most of his role. Janeane Garofalo appears as a date from hell, in a funny sequence. The ensemble cast does fine work under Sam Weisman's direction. The sad fact of this story is that all these children, we see in the film, will probably go through divorces in their own lives.
