    Milos Forman's biographic drama, though a little dragging and momentumless towards the middle, is a well-made movie, with incredible acting to steer it through. The movie misses the point, and tries to portray Mr.Larry Flynt as such a likable honest man. Larry Flynt, who had countless number of wives and divorces, whose ex-wives claim he was a beater, whose own daughter accused him of sexual abuse, who disowned his own daughter, whose magazines are a bit too sexist... is idealized a bit too much in the movie. But for what purpose? Why not show him the way he is? The whole point is to concentrate on the importance of the first amendment; no matter what kind of person it is, and what he/she is trying to express, the amendment gives them the freedom to do so. If the story was told from the neutral point of view of the lawyer (played by Edward Norton), with the magazines and the religious institutions on either side, it would have made a more compelling point. The acting is top-notch, and the only thin which holds the movie together. Woody Harrelson is a delight to watch, and Courtney Love is surprisingly good in her acting. Mr. Nortan does a charming supporting role.

    Courtney Love is the worst part of this movie. She's terrible, hard to stomach, and can't act to save her life. THAT SAID.... This is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and it really makes you think about what it means to live in the USA. For those of you out there reading this review who do not live in the USA, you've no doubt heard about how we Americans like to pride ourselves for being so freaking awesome... until someone points out how backwards and self-absorbed we really are. That's not to say Americans are bad (quite the contrary), but we definitely have a problem admitting when we're wrong. This movie makes no apologies, and goes straight for the jugular. And thanks to Milos Foreman, and Larry Flynt himself, this movie asks us to consider just how fundamental the right of free speech, and the freedom of expression, is to society. And yes, it relates to hardcore porn. Without delving too much into the technical aspects of the movie, let me just say that if you watch the Edward Norton courtroom scenes (the first where Larry Flynt himself is the judge, and the last one when he's arguing to the Supreme Court), and the epic speech our protagonist gives on "sex versus death," you are going to start developing opinions. It is going to make you think, and it might challenge your comfort zone. And for all those reasons, this movie is worth every moment of your time... including those painful scenes involving Courtney Love. I still think about this movie sometimes, whenever I hear people arguing about their First Amendment rights. Larry Flynt might not be a knight in shining armor, so to speak, but what he stands for is more than just porn - it's freedom of expression, and Americans have to accept that that doesn't necessarily mean something tame or conservative. It's an important lesson, and a movie that should not be missed.

    "The People Vs. Larry Flynt" is a film that might make you angry, or it may make you glad that we, as Americans, have the most cherished right any person could ask for: The freedom to voice an opinion or an idea, regardless of how unpopular or unappealing it may be. So it is with the true story of Larry Flynt, notorious publisher of the porn magazine "Hustler". It is essential to know that at no time does "People vs. Larry Flynt" try to depict it's title character as a saint, or a hero, or even someone you'd take to a family picnic. Flynt, by his own admission, acknowledges that he, and his magazine and it's content is the most provocative and blatant of it's kind in the field of pornographic material. But even more importantly is Flynt's assertion that if the First Amendment can protect someone like him, then it can protect each and every one of us who call ourselves Americans and our citizens' rights, for which countless men have fought and died to preserve. (Just for the record, I myself don't particularly care for pornographic material, but that's MY choice. I do not want nor will I abide any federal, state or local government invading MY life, telling me what I CAN or CANNOT partake of. If you want to talk about obscenity, I put it to you, dear reader, that the most obscene act a government can perform is to control the thoughts and words and ideas of it's own people. To do so is to hearken back to the days of Hitler, and other "thought police" who attempted to regulate free speech and independent thought. OK, rant over.) As to the film itself, the easiest way to describe it is that this is a top notch biographical story, filled with five star performances all around. Woody Harrelson, playing Flynt, does perhaps some of his greatest film work. Ed Norton, who plays Flynt's attorney, turns in yet another stellar job, and Courtney Love, who plays Flynt's wife, dazzles us by displaying, ironically enough, most of the same qualities that actually made her infamous in her own personal life. In the context of this film, however, those negatives of Love are exactly what was needed to recreate this character. The story, in a nutshell, southern Ohio club owner Larry Flynt gets the bright idea to base a magazine off of the type of entertainment he provides at his clubs. The magazine becomes a sensation, but also a perpetual target of moralistic crusaders who believe that material such as that produced by Flynt has no place anywhere in society; at least, in their eyes at any rate. And there is the conflict which drives this movie. Obscenity vs. Free Speech. Director Milos Forman gives us both sides of this argument throughout the film, but drives home the point that "American freedom" includes allowing others to voice opinions or present concepts that, while offensive and repulsive to some, are still just as worthy of protection as any other American's right to say what he or she feels. We follow Larry and his contemporaries through the rags to riches journey, and the ensuing attacks upon it by those who sternly disagree based on their own personal tastes. And "personal taste" is subjective, and therefore cannot be regulated to only one viewpoint. Late in the film, Flynt's case is brought before no less then the Supreme Court, stemming from an earlier court battle with evangelist Jerry Falwell. The ensuing decision from the High Court, which I'll leave for you to see for yourself, defines the very nature of the prospect of freedom of speech, and more importantly, the most rudimentary of basic civil rights as we know them in the United States. Whether you like or hate Larry Flynt, Hustler Magazine, or pornography of any kind is irrelevant. What one must accept if they wish to abide by our constitution, is the inalienable right of every man and woman to be free individuals in terms of their opinions, expressions and thoughts. To do otherwise is a slap in the face to every person who has ever fought for the American way. "The People Vs. Larry Flynt" is a magnificent tale of not just one man's fight for the freedom of speech, but the entire thought process of how strongly we wish to continue to be a free country. Watch it, and be glad you're an American with rights.

    The life of Hustler publisher Larry Flynt has almost too much good material. It's one thing to grow up selling moonshine, buy up some strip clubs and launch one of the most explicit pornography magazines ever created. It's another to also be a one-time born-again Christian, bipolar painkiller addict and the unsuspecting bastion of First Amendment liberties. As such, watching "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is like watching at least three different movies: You have the rise of the boundary-pushing magazine editor, the drug-addled romance and the courtroom drama. So many events in Flynt's life and facets to his personality warrant a deeper look, yet there's just no time. Writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewksi and of course two-time Oscar-winning director Milos Foreman make the most of each part, but the whole product lacks the unity of a masterful biography. At the time, Woody Harrelson proved a curious choice to play Flynt, but he nails the bipolar aspects of the master pornographer. We have so much trouble determining his motives, digging for some sign of logical thought. In most cases, this makes for a frustrating case study, for which you might normally blame the actor for not taking us deep enough. Considering how the film jumps from one aspect of Flynt's life to the next in addition to how completely unpredictable of a character he is, Harrelson deserves praise. He keeps you on your toes like the crazy uncle who jokes so much you can't tell when he's really serious. Then there's Courtney Love. Playing Flynt's stripper girlfriend-turned-wife, Althea, Love gives Foreman more than he bargained for. Hiring a drug addict to play a drug addict is a dangerous game, and not when it comes to working with that person. It's tough to divorce love from Althea, such a controversial public figure at the time and even to some extent to this day. She's frighteningly real as Althea at some points, especially once she starts mooching off Flynt's painkillers after the assassination attempt. Some of the most compelling drama in the film comes in the courtroom scenes. Those fascinated to any extent with free speech law and censorship will crave more from "The People vs. Larry Flynt," especially when the title seems to promise it in higher doses. Edward Norton nabbed a career-making role as Flynt's attorney, Alan Isaacman. Getting noticed by Milos Foreman and Woody Allen ("Everyone Says I Love You") at the same time is pretty impressive. He delivers an expert closing argument in the film's first trial that will have you convinced he wins the case, as well as a powerful yet light-hearted opening speech in the Supreme Court's hearing of the infamous Flynt vs. Falwell case, a landmark win for First Amendment rights. "The People vs. Larry Flynt" touches on so many fascinating aspects of this enigmatic figure, but it sacrifices some depth and consequently the emotional pull. Flynt's life blurs by, and though the writing compensates with some nice transitions, there's no substitute for getting Q.T. with Flynt. The Hustler empire appears to be built in a day a scene in which Flynt tells a photographer that "a woman's vagina has as much personality as her face" is the most insight we get into his mind as editor. Good writing there, but a fleeting moment in the bigger picture. The second half of the film, essentially Larry's life after becoming a paraplegic, feels so radically different. Larry's stroke garbles his speech and Althea's addiction has her looking like a flying monkey in the "Wizard of Oz." Two people who once seemed to have their wits about them become such filthy and disturbed characters. At that point you start to identify with Norton's character instead, as he's the only one who understands the balance between defending free speech and making a complete mockery of the judicial system. You'll want this film to be more of everything, particularly of Flynt as the unorthodox crusader for free speech and the magazine publisher who works the line between genius and insanity. The individual moments or scenes of such captivate, but get lost on the whole. The challenge of boiling a fascinating man's life down to a series of striking moments can sometimes be too immense for even the best of filmmakers. ~Steven C Thanks for reading!

    "If the First Amendment will protect a scumbag like me, then it'll protect all of you -- 'cause I'm the worst," declares Hustler Magazine publisher Larry Flynt in the midst of one of his many court cases. The People vs. Larry Flynt is a biographical drama film directed by Milo Forman about the rise of pornographic magazine publisher and editor Larry Flynt, and his subsequent clash with the law. The film stars Woody Harrelson, Courtney Love, and Edward Norton.The film was written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. It spans about 25 years of Flynt's life from his impoverished upbringing in Kentucky to his court battle with Reverend Jerry Falwell, and is based in part on the U.S. Supreme Court case Hustler Magazine v. Falwell. Forman's film follows Flynt from his childhood in Kentucky, where he made extra money for his dirt-poor family by selling the moonshine his father brewed, into adulthood as he manages a strip club in Cincinnati. While the club does middling business, the experience changes Flynt's life in two ways: he meets Althea, an exotic dancer who becomes the love of his life, and he gets the bright idea of starting a magazine to promote the club. Marketed as a crasser, less pretentious alternative to Playboy or Penthouse, Hustler becomes a huge success after Flynt runs a photo series of Jacqueline Onassis sunbathing nude. However, while plenty of people are buying Hustler, there are also plenty of people who don't care for it, including Charles Keating, leader of a watchdog group called Citizens For Decent Literature. Keating spearheads the first of many legal attacks on the magazine, one of which reaches the Supreme Court as Alan Isaacman, Flynt's lawyer, debates the finer legal points of bad taste with the justices of the highest court in the land. Meanwhile, Flynt makes a fortune, loses the use of his legs after an attack by a sniper, embraces and than abandons Christianity, and eventually loses Althea, who succumbs to AIDS after a long addiction to drugs. A brave, spectacularly entertaining -- and unexpectedly stirring -- account of Flynt's life that asks us to regard the publisher of Hustler magazine as an invaluable champion of our First Amendment freedoms.It's a modern-day Capra film, about an unorthodox businessman who's persecuted for his originality but eventually is recognized for the lovable, rugged American individualist he truly is.Woody Harrelson plays Flynt with energy, and Courtney Love does at least as well as his wife.And special mention also goes to Edward Norton.The screenplay, by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, is rich in detail and dialogue.But still,the movie is not compelling enough to generate interest and great entertainment to the viewer.But still,it is a good movie to watch.

    A few years ago, I went to a DVD grocery store, eager to buy Tex Avery's collector DVD box, featuring all his hilarious MGM cartoons. Two cartoons were missing though and I found out they were banned because of racial stereotypes' portrayals on black people, and that they would never be put on DVD, or TV again, despite all the fans' protests and all the petitions: these cartoons were judged too offensive. No offense, but this is just bullshit, the only word to describe this is censorship: pure and simple. And in 2004, its reign of terror wasn't over yet  I'm evoking this anecdote just to highlight the sad reality that we still live in a world governed by a scandalous hypocrisy disguising censorship under the mask of political correctness. Lenny Bruce was censored because of his use of profanity and Larry Flynt for his pornographic images. Now that the Internet trivialized sex, the new taboo is communities. The 21st century is religious, racial, sectary and unfortunately, the fight featured in "The People vs. Larry Flynt" had only changed the field. The War is not over; the nonsense is still governing non-independent media, and we're still brainwashed  This is why "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is probably one of the most important films of the last two decades. It reveals the disastrous sickness that poisons America and Occidental counties in general: Political Correctness, the new dictatorship against every single principle that makes freedom of speech applicable. The message could be summarized in a simple point, in the case of absence of malice, one should make fun, mock, ridicule whatever people, institution, he or she desires. It's not up to the offender to anticipate the harm he will cause, it's up to the offended to accept the idea that whatever allowed one to talk against him, it will allow him to retort, in a satirical, serious or whatever tone he chooses to use. In one word: it's called tolerance. That's exactly why "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is not just a pamphlet written by Milos Forman using profanity, sex, lust, and nudity as so many punctuation marks. It's an inspirational message inviting us to question our approach to tolerance, and not in a preachy way. Larry Flynt is not a model, he's a dirty mind, but as he says, "he's the worst" and as the worst, he'll be the perfect thermometer to measure the acceptance of a country when it comes to the use of humor. But as I also stated in a previous review of Fosse's "Lenny", any simple form of thought is necessarily subversive. Any artistic creation offends a certain established order, otherwise, it's just creation but not Art. Larry Flynt offended, he broke a new taboo, but have we all forgotten that many today's standards were yesterday's taboos?! The philosophical value of "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is undeniable but I guess people were blinded by the profusion of nudity and lust at a point they didn't get how the film is incredibly brilliant in the demonstrations it tries to make ... sometimes in an explicitness I would have judged extreme if the course of the recent events hadn't proved how the point of the film was totally missed. Flynt paved the way to a certain philosophy of freedom that could allow many irreverent entertainers to undermine the image of sacred public, figures or institutions and even, for our delight, respectable cultural figures. But, there's more to that -something that'll make me venerate the film forever- it's the denunciation of an extreme contradiction that could threaten the application of freedom in a whole country: nothing is sacred enough not to be turned into derision. And if one thing shall be sacred, it's this principle. The title sets the mood of the film which is an endless fight through so many judiciary cases involving the 'good people' and Larry Flynt, another title could have been "Larry Flynt, Public Enemy N&deg;1" but this would have been wrong as Flynt had some fans interested on boobs, vagina, and fornication. And in a way, Flynt had done a great service to his country by desensitizing them about the dirtiness of sex. While many citizens were brainwashed to believe that Wars make heroes, in one of the most obscene masquerades that lead American to an humiliating defeat in Nam, Flynt unmasked the ugly face of American pride to reconcile it, with stuff that reaches a lower level ... only to prove there's no reason to feel guilty about loving harmless stuff just because good society says so. Especially when desensitization from violence can have even more devastating effects. And on a technical level, "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is certainly one of the most brilliant scripts ever written swinging between an outrageous and a thought-provoking tone until getting to its point, which is the inspirational denunciation of the hypocrisy governing our world. And freedom of laughing is indeed a way to fight taboos by their own weapons. I did not take Woody Harrelson seriously in the first notes of this brilliant symphony but how wrong I was, he was quite perfect in that role, and I can't go without mentioning Edward Norton as the struggling personal attorney Alan Isaacman, and to conclude Courtney Love in what I consider one of the greatest female performances ever, and I say it again, ONE OF THE GREATEST FEMALE PERFORMANCES EVER, I wonder how she didn't get and win an Oscar. Too trashy? Gimme a break, her devotion and sincere true love towards her husband made Larry's fight so endearing, she was the soul and heart of this film, while Norton was the brain. And Larry was the guts, that despite a tragic handicap was an inspiration to every citizen, to believe in his right to please his basic instincts ... it's basic principles.

    Say what you will about the subject matter of this film, it is very good. The People vs. Larry Flynt is about the creator of Hustler magazine, an extremely racy pornographic magazine that was way ahead of its time, and the legal battles that ensued upon its creation and development. It focuses on aspects of Flynt's home life as well as his business. His offensive magazine was condemned by onslaughts of disgusted American's, and this lead to Larry Flynt being a figurehead in the battle for free speech. The film tells a very interesting story with a colorful cast of odd characters, including the obscene and bizarre protagonist himself. The story that this film tells is not one that you will hear discussed in everyday society. It just isn't something that can easily be brought up, because of its raunchy subject matter. And that's why I enjoyed this movie so much, because it told a surprisingly fascinating story. There was a lot more to this legal battle than meets the eye. There was a surprising amount of aspects to the story that I wasn't expecting. The movie told a very interesting story about a very interesting man. The film covers a lot more ground than is to be expected. It begins with Larry and his brother running a small time strip club. Not long after the movie begins is Hustler created and Flynt begins to thrive. The main focus of the films conflict then starts to arise as Flynt is attacked by naysayers who are disgusted by what he is doing. From here a lot of things happen, some good, others not so good. There is plenty of comedy, drama, and even tragedy in this unorthodox story about a very unorthodox and yet fascinating man. I think I've made it clear that Larry Flynt was a fascinating character to watch unfold in this movie, but that doesn't mean he was a likable one. To put it lightly, Larry Flynt was a jerk in this film. He was vulgar, rude, and obscene. He objectified women and had little to no respect for authority. There were times where he became unbearably obnoxious in the film, but it all played in to what the character was all about. He undoubtedly developed issues as he grew older. He suffered one physical tragedy that left him impaired physically, but also drove his mind into depravity as well. But despite all this, I can't say I disrespect him for being so determined to exercise his first amendment rights. Considering the situation, you really can't argue with the points he makes in the film, whether you agree with him or not. The tagline of the film says it best. You might not like what he does, but are you prepared to give up his right to do it? This sums up what the legal battle the film focuses on is all about. He has the right to do what he does whether you like it or not. The film delivered very interesting battle of wits and morals. The film boasts a fascinating story with a variety of different characters, and it thankfully has the cast to hold up this aspect of the film. Woody Harrelson plays Larry Flynt, and he does an incredible job. Flynt goes through a lot of changes, both physical and mental, throughout the course of the film, and Harrelson conveys those changes extraordinarily well. It is definitely one of his finest leading roles. Courtney Love plays Flynt's wife, Althea. Now, I have absolutely no expect for Courtney Love. She is a disgusting and tasteless woman with no redeeming qualities except for her performance in The People vs. Larry Flynt. As much as I dislike Love, she does a fantastic job as Althea, a troubled and emotional character that isn't easy to access or understand the motives of because she is really just a nutjob. The character is very multi-dimensional, and Courtney Love does a surprising job at conveying it. Edward Norton plays Flynt's lawyer, Alan Isaacman. The character is another very interesting one. He shows how difficult it is to be the lawyer for a deranged man like Larry Flynt, but his will and determination give him an insightful and compelling edge that I really enjoyed. Plus I love Norton in everything he does, so loving him and his character was a no-brainer. I really loved this movie. It isn't perfect but what it delivers is excellent. The narrative has some issues. In the beginning of the film conflicts seem to arise and then just disappear without another word. There are some abrupt cuts that give the film an uneven feel and pacing. But by the end of the film these issues are easily forgivable because of how much I liked the overall story this film delivers. I really liked everything about this film and could easily see past some of its imperfections. The story is unique and interesting, and so are the characters that are portrayed by a great cast. Don't be turned off by this film's subject matter. You don't want to miss it.

    This is most certainly an interesting account of the life of Larry Flynt - the publisher of Hustler Magazine, perhaps the trashiest "mainstream" porn magazine ever published. Beginning with Flynt as a boy selling moonshine to his neighbours, the movie ends with Flynt triumphing over the Reverend Jerry Falwell in a case before the United States Supreme Court. What we see between these two events is disturbing, shocking and sometimes even funny. Flynt is anything but an attractive personality. Evolving from the owner of struggling strip club to a millionaire porn merchant, I suppose one has to respect the man for his ability to achieve his dreams and the triumph against the odds, but the "me against the world" persona wears thin after a while. Flynt comes across through most of this as self-absorbed. He claims to be fighting for the freedom of speech, but one really has the feeling that he's fighting for it not for the sake of anyone but himself. I didn't get the sense from this movie that Flynt had any sort of "greater good" at the forefront of his thoughts, although in fairness he has remained active in this area. There's an interesting look at his temporary conversion to Christianity, and his growing relationship with Ruth Carter Stapleton (Jimmy Carter's sister) who converted him to Christianity, which becomes quite humorous as he struggles within himself to reconcile his newfound faith with his work as a porn publisher. The movie also deals with his rejection of that faith and increasing bitterness after the shooting that left him paralyzed. There's great emphasis placed on his personal life and in particular with his wife Althea, who became a drug addict and an AIDS victim. (Interestingly, there's no reference to the fact that she was his fourth wife.) There are some great performances in this. Woody Harrelson offers a superb portrayal of Flynt (perhaps Harrelson's best acting) - sometimes in total control, other times totally out of control. Courtney Love was totally believable as Althea - devoted to Flynt but rapidly spiralling out of control herself. Edward Norton was fine as Flynt's long- suffering attorney Allan Isaacson. Flynt actually appears in this movie as the judge at his own first trial (at least the first one portrayed in the movie) in Cincinnati. Still, this is a difficult movie. It's fascinating for a while, but becomes a bit tiresome and repetitive after a while. Flynt repeats the same antics over and over again and after a while they lose their impact. The lead up to the court fight against Falwell - who sued him for libel for a satirical article in Hustler that accused him of incest - took up a lot of time, but it was hard to feel passion about it. Neither party is particularly attractive to me. Personally, I think Flynt's depiction of Falwell as a hypocrite was bang-on, but Flynt himself is just not a likable person, and it's hard to root for him against anyone - even Falwell. This is a good account of a life that would have to be described in many contradictory ways: a success story, but a very sad one. The guy who pushes the envelope beyond the breaking point but then objects when anyone pushes back. The guy who stands up for free speech and ends up front and centre in the midst of the battle, except that you kind of wish he wouldn't exercise it for himself. He's a strange guy.

    Movie about Larry Flynt--publisher of "Hustler" magazine. He's played by Woody Harrelson and it follows him from 1972 to the 1980s and deals with him defending his magazine against obscenity charges. It also details his wife Althea (Courtney Love) and their relationship. I've heard this movie was an idealized version of the true story but I knew nothing about Flynt before I saw this movie so I saw it with no preconceptions. It's episodic but compelling. Harrelson is GREAT in the title role. He does not turn Flynt into a saint--he's portrayed as obnoxious, controlling and a real jerk at times. However he does make it clear that "Hustler" should not be banned or considered obscene and he makes his case well. Most of it is through his lawyer Alan Isaacman (Edward Norton) who's very good in his role. But top acting honors go to Love who is just incredible as Althea. You see her character very convincingly age during the movie and you see her love and frustration with Flynt. Just a great performance which was totally ignored at the Academy Awards. Also it was great to see great character actors like Crispin Glover, Vincent Schiavelli and James Cromwell in small roles. It was well-directed by Milos Forman and shows the decades it takes place in very well. (There's fantastic use of the 1970s song "Dream Weaver") It's just a little bit overlong. The multiple court sequences get repetitious by hammering the same concepts to us again and again. Also it gets VERY depressing during it's last hour or so. Still, I found it fascinating and compelling. You may not like Flynt or his magazine but it makes a good case for admiring him for what he was fighting for. I give it an 8.

    Woody Harrelson delivers his best performance in director Milos Foreman's tragic true story, The people vs. Larry Flint. All of the actors give their best in this occasionally funny and sad true story. Woody Harrelson gives his best as Larry Flint, who starts the film off with owning a strip club with his brother. Then, Larry comes up with the idea for "Hustler" magazine,which i'm sure everyone has heard of. The film starts off sort of fun. But it takes a tragic turn when he is arrested. And after his arrest, his marriage to his stripper wife(Courtney Love, giving the most realistic and greatest performance of all) falls apart,and they try to find as many ways to arrest him as possible. I can't forget the performance by Edward Norton. Norton gives a lovable performance in everything he's in. Even if he's playing a bad guy he's lovable. And his performance here is both lovable and real. What a sad film. Really, it is. America destroyed Larry Flint. And it's tragic to watch cause the majority of the characters are so likable. And it's very sad to see all of their lives slowly fall apart throughout the years. The people vs. Larry Flint is a fantastic.It's funny,sad,powerful, and well acted. Courtney Love gives us the best performance in the film. Yes,better than Edward Norton. This is a forgotten classic that must be seen. The people vs. Larry Flint:4/4

    Milos Forman's biographic drama, though a little dragging and momentumless towards the middle, is a well-made movie, with incredible acting to steer it through. The movie misses the point, and tries to portray Mr.Larry Flynt as such a likable honest man. Larry Flynt, who had countless number of wives and divorces, whose ex-wives claim he was a beater, whose own daughter accused him of sexual abuse, who disowned his own daughter, whose magazines are a bit too sexist... is idealized a bit too much in the movie. But for what purpose? Why not show him the way he is? The whole point is to concentrate on the importance of the first amendment; no matter what kind of person it is, and what he/she is trying to express, the amendment gives them the freedom to do so. If the story was told from the neutral point of view of the lawyer (played by Edward Norton), with the magazines and the religious institutions on either side, it would have made a more compelling point. The acting is top-notch, and the only thin which holds the movie together. Woody Harrelson is a delight to watch, and Courtney Love is surprisingly good in her acting. Mr. Nortan does a charming supporting role.

    Courtney Love is the worst part of this movie. She's terrible, hard to stomach, and can't act to save her life. THAT SAID.... This is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and it really makes you think about what it means to live in the USA. For those of you out there reading this review who do not live in the USA, you've no doubt heard about how we Americans like to pride ourselves for being so freaking awesome... until someone points out how backwards and self-absorbed we really are. That's not to say Americans are bad (quite the contrary), but we definitely have a problem admitting when we're wrong. This movie makes no apologies, and goes straight for the jugular. And thanks to Milos Foreman, and Larry Flynt himself, this movie asks us to consider just how fundamental the right of free speech, and the freedom of expression, is to society. And yes, it relates to hardcore porn. Without delving too much into the technical aspects of the movie, let me just say that if you watch the Edward Norton courtroom scenes (the first where Larry Flynt himself is the judge, and the last one when he's arguing to the Supreme Court), and the epic speech our protagonist gives on "sex versus death," you are going to start developing opinions. It is going to make you think, and it might challenge your comfort zone. And for all those reasons, this movie is worth every moment of your time... including those painful scenes involving Courtney Love. I still think about this movie sometimes, whenever I hear people arguing about their First Amendment rights. Larry Flynt might not be a knight in shining armor, so to speak, but what he stands for is more than just porn - it's freedom of expression, and Americans have to accept that that doesn't necessarily mean something tame or conservative. It's an important lesson, and a movie that should not be missed.

    "The People Vs. Larry Flynt" is a film that might make you angry, or it may make you glad that we, as Americans, have the most cherished right any person could ask for: The freedom to voice an opinion or an idea, regardless of how unpopular or unappealing it may be. So it is with the true story of Larry Flynt, notorious publisher of the porn magazine "Hustler". It is essential to know that at no time does "People vs. Larry Flynt" try to depict it's title character as a saint, or a hero, or even someone you'd take to a family picnic. Flynt, by his own admission, acknowledges that he, and his magazine and it's content is the most provocative and blatant of it's kind in the field of pornographic material. But even more importantly is Flynt's assertion that if the First Amendment can protect someone like him, then it can protect each and every one of us who call ourselves Americans and our citizens' rights, for which countless men have fought and died to preserve. (Just for the record, I myself don't particularly care for pornographic material, but that's MY choice. I do not want nor will I abide any federal, state or local government invading MY life, telling me what I CAN or CANNOT partake of. If you want to talk about obscenity, I put it to you, dear reader, that the most obscene act a government can perform is to control the thoughts and words and ideas of it's own people. To do so is to hearken back to the days of Hitler, and other "thought police" who attempted to regulate free speech and independent thought. OK, rant over.) As to the film itself, the easiest way to describe it is that this is a top notch biographical story, filled with five star performances all around. Woody Harrelson, playing Flynt, does perhaps some of his greatest film work. Ed Norton, who plays Flynt's attorney, turns in yet another stellar job, and Courtney Love, who plays Flynt's wife, dazzles us by displaying, ironically enough, most of the same qualities that actually made her infamous in her own personal life. In the context of this film, however, those negatives of Love are exactly what was needed to recreate this character. The story, in a nutshell, southern Ohio club owner Larry Flynt gets the bright idea to base a magazine off of the type of entertainment he provides at his clubs. The magazine becomes a sensation, but also a perpetual target of moralistic crusaders who believe that material such as that produced by Flynt has no place anywhere in society; at least, in their eyes at any rate. And there is the conflict which drives this movie. Obscenity vs. Free Speech. Director Milos Forman gives us both sides of this argument throughout the film, but drives home the point that "American freedom" includes allowing others to voice opinions or present concepts that, while offensive and repulsive to some, are still just as worthy of protection as any other American's right to say what he or she feels. We follow Larry and his contemporaries through the rags to riches journey, and the ensuing attacks upon it by those who sternly disagree based on their own personal tastes. And "personal taste" is subjective, and therefore cannot be regulated to only one viewpoint. Late in the film, Flynt's case is brought before no less then the Supreme Court, stemming from an earlier court battle with evangelist Jerry Falwell. The ensuing decision from the High Court, which I'll leave for you to see for yourself, defines the very nature of the prospect of freedom of speech, and more importantly, the most rudimentary of basic civil rights as we know them in the United States. Whether you like or hate Larry Flynt, Hustler Magazine, or pornography of any kind is irrelevant. What one must accept if they wish to abide by our constitution, is the inalienable right of every man and woman to be free individuals in terms of their opinions, expressions and thoughts. To do otherwise is a slap in the face to every person who has ever fought for the American way. "The People Vs. Larry Flynt" is a magnificent tale of not just one man's fight for the freedom of speech, but the entire thought process of how strongly we wish to continue to be a free country. Watch it, and be glad you're an American with rights.

    The life of Hustler publisher Larry Flynt has almost too much good material. It's one thing to grow up selling moonshine, buy up some strip clubs and launch one of the most explicit pornography magazines ever created. It's another to also be a one-time born-again Christian, bipolar painkiller addict and the unsuspecting bastion of First Amendment liberties. As such, watching "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is like watching at least three different movies: You have the rise of the boundary-pushing magazine editor, the drug-addled romance and the courtroom drama. So many events in Flynt's life and facets to his personality warrant a deeper look, yet there's just no time. Writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewksi and of course two-time Oscar-winning director Milos Foreman make the most of each part, but the whole product lacks the unity of a masterful biography. At the time, Woody Harrelson proved a curious choice to play Flynt, but he nails the bipolar aspects of the master pornographer. We have so much trouble determining his motives, digging for some sign of logical thought. In most cases, this makes for a frustrating case study, for which you might normally blame the actor for not taking us deep enough. Considering how the film jumps from one aspect of Flynt's life to the next in addition to how completely unpredictable of a character he is, Harrelson deserves praise. He keeps you on your toes like the crazy uncle who jokes so much you can't tell when he's really serious. Then there's Courtney Love. Playing Flynt's stripper girlfriend-turned-wife, Althea, Love gives Foreman more than he bargained for. Hiring a drug addict to play a drug addict is a dangerous game, and not when it comes to working with that person. It's tough to divorce love from Althea, such a controversial public figure at the time and even to some extent to this day. She's frighteningly real as Althea at some points, especially once she starts mooching off Flynt's painkillers after the assassination attempt. Some of the most compelling drama in the film comes in the courtroom scenes. Those fascinated to any extent with free speech law and censorship will crave more from "The People vs. Larry Flynt," especially when the title seems to promise it in higher doses. Edward Norton nabbed a career-making role as Flynt's attorney, Alan Isaacman. Getting noticed by Milos Foreman and Woody Allen ("Everyone Says I Love You") at the same time is pretty impressive. He delivers an expert closing argument in the film's first trial that will have you convinced he wins the case, as well as a powerful yet light-hearted opening speech in the Supreme Court's hearing of the infamous Flynt vs. Falwell case, a landmark win for First Amendment rights. "The People vs. Larry Flynt" touches on so many fascinating aspects of this enigmatic figure, but it sacrifices some depth and consequently the emotional pull. Flynt's life blurs by, and though the writing compensates with some nice transitions, there's no substitute for getting Q.T. with Flynt. The Hustler empire appears to be built in a day a scene in which Flynt tells a photographer that "a woman's vagina has as much personality as her face" is the most insight we get into his mind as editor. Good writing there, but a fleeting moment in the bigger picture. The second half of the film, essentially Larry's life after becoming a paraplegic, feels so radically different. Larry's stroke garbles his speech and Althea's addiction has her looking like a flying monkey in the "Wizard of Oz." Two people who once seemed to have their wits about them become such filthy and disturbed characters. At that point you start to identify with Norton's character instead, as he's the only one who understands the balance between defending free speech and making a complete mockery of the judicial system. You'll want this film to be more of everything, particularly of Flynt as the unorthodox crusader for free speech and the magazine publisher who works the line between genius and insanity. The individual moments or scenes of such captivate, but get lost on the whole. The challenge of boiling a fascinating man's life down to a series of striking moments can sometimes be too immense for even the best of filmmakers. ~Steven C Thanks for reading!

    "If the First Amendment will protect a scumbag like me, then it'll protect all of you -- 'cause I'm the worst," declares Hustler Magazine publisher Larry Flynt in the midst of one of his many court cases. The People vs. Larry Flynt is a biographical drama film directed by Milo Forman about the rise of pornographic magazine publisher and editor Larry Flynt, and his subsequent clash with the law. The film stars Woody Harrelson, Courtney Love, and Edward Norton.The film was written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. It spans about 25 years of Flynt's life from his impoverished upbringing in Kentucky to his court battle with Reverend Jerry Falwell, and is based in part on the U.S. Supreme Court case Hustler Magazine v. Falwell. Forman's film follows Flynt from his childhood in Kentucky, where he made extra money for his dirt-poor family by selling the moonshine his father brewed, into adulthood as he manages a strip club in Cincinnati. While the club does middling business, the experience changes Flynt's life in two ways: he meets Althea, an exotic dancer who becomes the love of his life, and he gets the bright idea of starting a magazine to promote the club. Marketed as a crasser, less pretentious alternative to Playboy or Penthouse, Hustler becomes a huge success after Flynt runs a photo series of Jacqueline Onassis sunbathing nude. However, while plenty of people are buying Hustler, there are also plenty of people who don't care for it, including Charles Keating, leader of a watchdog group called Citizens For Decent Literature. Keating spearheads the first of many legal attacks on the magazine, one of which reaches the Supreme Court as Alan Isaacman, Flynt's lawyer, debates the finer legal points of bad taste with the justices of the highest court in the land. Meanwhile, Flynt makes a fortune, loses the use of his legs after an attack by a sniper, embraces and than abandons Christianity, and eventually loses Althea, who succumbs to AIDS after a long addiction to drugs. A brave, spectacularly entertaining -- and unexpectedly stirring -- account of Flynt's life that asks us to regard the publisher of Hustler magazine as an invaluable champion of our First Amendment freedoms.It's a modern-day Capra film, about an unorthodox businessman who's persecuted for his originality but eventually is recognized for the lovable, rugged American individualist he truly is.Woody Harrelson plays Flynt with energy, and Courtney Love does at least as well as his wife.And special mention also goes to Edward Norton.The screenplay, by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, is rich in detail and dialogue.But still,the movie is not compelling enough to generate interest and great entertainment to the viewer.But still,it is a good movie to watch.

    A few years ago, I went to a DVD grocery store, eager to buy Tex Avery's collector DVD box, featuring all his hilarious MGM cartoons. Two cartoons were missing though and I found out they were banned because of racial stereotypes' portrayals on black people, and that they would never be put on DVD, or TV again, despite all the fans' protests and all the petitions: these cartoons were judged too offensive. No offense, but this is just bullshit, the only word to describe this is censorship: pure and simple. And in 2004, its reign of terror wasn't over yet  I'm evoking this anecdote just to highlight the sad reality that we still live in a world governed by a scandalous hypocrisy disguising censorship under the mask of political correctness. Lenny Bruce was censored because of his use of profanity and Larry Flynt for his pornographic images. Now that the Internet trivialized sex, the new taboo is communities. The 21st century is religious, racial, sectary and unfortunately, the fight featured in "The People vs. Larry Flynt" had only changed the field. The War is not over; the nonsense is still governing non-independent media, and we're still brainwashed  This is why "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is probably one of the most important films of the last two decades. It reveals the disastrous sickness that poisons America and Occidental counties in general: Political Correctness, the new dictatorship against every single principle that makes freedom of speech applicable. The message could be summarized in a simple point, in the case of absence of malice, one should make fun, mock, ridicule whatever people, institution, he or she desires. It's not up to the offender to anticipate the harm he will cause, it's up to the offended to accept the idea that whatever allowed one to talk against him, it will allow him to retort, in a satirical, serious or whatever tone he chooses to use. In one word: it's called tolerance. That's exactly why "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is not just a pamphlet written by Milos Forman using profanity, sex, lust, and nudity as so many punctuation marks. It's an inspirational message inviting us to question our approach to tolerance, and not in a preachy way. Larry Flynt is not a model, he's a dirty mind, but as he says, "he's the worst" and as the worst, he'll be the perfect thermometer to measure the acceptance of a country when it comes to the use of humor. But as I also stated in a previous review of Fosse's "Lenny", any simple form of thought is necessarily subversive. Any artistic creation offends a certain established order, otherwise, it's just creation but not Art. Larry Flynt offended, he broke a new taboo, but have we all forgotten that many today's standards were yesterday's taboos?! The philosophical value of "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is undeniable but I guess people were blinded by the profusion of nudity and lust at a point they didn't get how the film is incredibly brilliant in the demonstrations it tries to make ... sometimes in an explicitness I would have judged extreme if the course of the recent events hadn't proved how the point of the film was totally missed. Flynt paved the way to a certain philosophy of freedom that could allow many irreverent entertainers to undermine the image of sacred public, figures or institutions and even, for our delight, respectable cultural figures. But, there's more to that -something that'll make me venerate the film forever- it's the denunciation of an extreme contradiction that could threaten the application of freedom in a whole country: nothing is sacred enough not to be turned into derision. And if one thing shall be sacred, it's this principle. The title sets the mood of the film which is an endless fight through so many judiciary cases involving the 'good people' and Larry Flynt, another title could have been "Larry Flynt, Public Enemy N&deg;1" but this would have been wrong as Flynt had some fans interested on boobs, vagina, and fornication. And in a way, Flynt had done a great service to his country by desensitizing them about the dirtiness of sex. While many citizens were brainwashed to believe that Wars make heroes, in one of the most obscene masquerades that lead American to an humiliating defeat in Nam, Flynt unmasked the ugly face of American pride to reconcile it, with stuff that reaches a lower level ... only to prove there's no reason to feel guilty about loving harmless stuff just because good society says so. Especially when desensitization from violence can have even more devastating effects. And on a technical level, "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is certainly one of the most brilliant scripts ever written swinging between an outrageous and a thought-provoking tone until getting to its point, which is the inspirational denunciation of the hypocrisy governing our world. And freedom of laughing is indeed a way to fight taboos by their own weapons. I did not take Woody Harrelson seriously in the first notes of this brilliant symphony but how wrong I was, he was quite perfect in that role, and I can't go without mentioning Edward Norton as the struggling personal attorney Alan Isaacman, and to conclude Courtney Love in what I consider one of the greatest female performances ever, and I say it again, ONE OF THE GREATEST FEMALE PERFORMANCES EVER, I wonder how she didn't get and win an Oscar. Too trashy? Gimme a break, her devotion and sincere true love towards her husband made Larry's fight so endearing, she was the soul and heart of this film, while Norton was the brain. And Larry was the guts, that despite a tragic handicap was an inspiration to every citizen, to believe in his right to please his basic instincts ... it's basic principles.

    Say what you will about the subject matter of this film, it is very good. The People vs. Larry Flynt is about the creator of Hustler magazine, an extremely racy pornographic magazine that was way ahead of its time, and the legal battles that ensued upon its creation and development. It focuses on aspects of Flynt's home life as well as his business. His offensive magazine was condemned by onslaughts of disgusted American's, and this lead to Larry Flynt being a figurehead in the battle for free speech. The film tells a very interesting story with a colorful cast of odd characters, including the obscene and bizarre protagonist himself. The story that this film tells is not one that you will hear discussed in everyday society. It just isn't something that can easily be brought up, because of its raunchy subject matter. And that's why I enjoyed this movie so much, because it told a surprisingly fascinating story. There was a lot more to this legal battle than meets the eye. There was a surprising amount of aspects to the story that I wasn't expecting. The movie told a very interesting story about a very interesting man. The film covers a lot more ground than is to be expected. It begins with Larry and his brother running a small time strip club. Not long after the movie begins is Hustler created and Flynt begins to thrive. The main focus of the films conflict then starts to arise as Flynt is attacked by naysayers who are disgusted by what he is doing. From here a lot of things happen, some good, others not so good. There is plenty of comedy, drama, and even tragedy in this unorthodox story about a very unorthodox and yet fascinating man. I think I've made it clear that Larry Flynt was a fascinating character to watch unfold in this movie, but that doesn't mean he was a likable one. To put it lightly, Larry Flynt was a jerk in this film. He was vulgar, rude, and obscene. He objectified women and had little to no respect for authority. There were times where he became unbearably obnoxious in the film, but it all played in to what the character was all about. He undoubtedly developed issues as he grew older. He suffered one physical tragedy that left him impaired physically, but also drove his mind into depravity as well. But despite all this, I can't say I disrespect him for being so determined to exercise his first amendment rights. Considering the situation, you really can't argue with the points he makes in the film, whether you agree with him or not. The tagline of the film says it best. You might not like what he does, but are you prepared to give up his right to do it? This sums up what the legal battle the film focuses on is all about. He has the right to do what he does whether you like it or not. The film delivered very interesting battle of wits and morals. The film boasts a fascinating story with a variety of different characters, and it thankfully has the cast to hold up this aspect of the film. Woody Harrelson plays Larry Flynt, and he does an incredible job. Flynt goes through a lot of changes, both physical and mental, throughout the course of the film, and Harrelson conveys those changes extraordinarily well. It is definitely one of his finest leading roles. Courtney Love plays Flynt's wife, Althea. Now, I have absolutely no expect for Courtney Love. She is a disgusting and tasteless woman with no redeeming qualities except for her performance in The People vs. Larry Flynt. As much as I dislike Love, she does a fantastic job as Althea, a troubled and emotional character that isn't easy to access or understand the motives of because she is really just a nutjob. The character is very multi-dimensional, and Courtney Love does a surprising job at conveying it. Edward Norton plays Flynt's lawyer, Alan Isaacman. The character is another very interesting one. He shows how difficult it is to be the lawyer for a deranged man like Larry Flynt, but his will and determination give him an insightful and compelling edge that I really enjoyed. Plus I love Norton in everything he does, so loving him and his character was a no-brainer. I really loved this movie. It isn't perfect but what it delivers is excellent. The narrative has some issues. In the beginning of the film conflicts seem to arise and then just disappear without another word. There are some abrupt cuts that give the film an uneven feel and pacing. But by the end of the film these issues are easily forgivable because of how much I liked the overall story this film delivers. I really liked everything about this film and could easily see past some of its imperfections. The story is unique and interesting, and so are the characters that are portrayed by a great cast. Don't be turned off by this film's subject matter. You don't want to miss it.

    This is most certainly an interesting account of the life of Larry Flynt - the publisher of Hustler Magazine, perhaps the trashiest "mainstream" porn magazine ever published. Beginning with Flynt as a boy selling moonshine to his neighbours, the movie ends with Flynt triumphing over the Reverend Jerry Falwell in a case before the United States Supreme Court. What we see between these two events is disturbing, shocking and sometimes even funny. Flynt is anything but an attractive personality. Evolving from the owner of struggling strip club to a millionaire porn merchant, I suppose one has to respect the man for his ability to achieve his dreams and the triumph against the odds, but the "me against the world" persona wears thin after a while. Flynt comes across through most of this as self-absorbed. He claims to be fighting for the freedom of speech, but one really has the feeling that he's fighting for it not for the sake of anyone but himself. I didn't get the sense from this movie that Flynt had any sort of "greater good" at the forefront of his thoughts, although in fairness he has remained active in this area. There's an interesting look at his temporary conversion to Christianity, and his growing relationship with Ruth Carter Stapleton (Jimmy Carter's sister) who converted him to Christianity, which becomes quite humorous as he struggles within himself to reconcile his newfound faith with his work as a porn publisher. The movie also deals with his rejection of that faith and increasing bitterness after the shooting that left him paralyzed. There's great emphasis placed on his personal life and in particular with his wife Althea, who became a drug addict and an AIDS victim. (Interestingly, there's no reference to the fact that she was his fourth wife.) There are some great performances in this. Woody Harrelson offers a superb portrayal of Flynt (perhaps Harrelson's best acting) - sometimes in total control, other times totally out of control. Courtney Love was totally believable as Althea - devoted to Flynt but rapidly spiralling out of control herself. Edward Norton was fine as Flynt's long- suffering attorney Allan Isaacson. Flynt actually appears in this movie as the judge at his own first trial (at least the first one portrayed in the movie) in Cincinnati. Still, this is a difficult movie. It's fascinating for a while, but becomes a bit tiresome and repetitive after a while. Flynt repeats the same antics over and over again and after a while they lose their impact. The lead up to the court fight against Falwell - who sued him for libel for a satirical article in Hustler that accused him of incest - took up a lot of time, but it was hard to feel passion about it. Neither party is particularly attractive to me. Personally, I think Flynt's depiction of Falwell as a hypocrite was bang-on, but Flynt himself is just not a likable person, and it's hard to root for him against anyone - even Falwell. This is a good account of a life that would have to be described in many contradictory ways: a success story, but a very sad one. The guy who pushes the envelope beyond the breaking point but then objects when anyone pushes back. The guy who stands up for free speech and ends up front and centre in the midst of the battle, except that you kind of wish he wouldn't exercise it for himself. He's a strange guy.

    Movie about Larry Flynt--publisher of "Hustler" magazine. He's played by Woody Harrelson and it follows him from 1972 to the 1980s and deals with him defending his magazine against obscenity charges. It also details his wife Althea (Courtney Love) and their relationship. I've heard this movie was an idealized version of the true story but I knew nothing about Flynt before I saw this movie so I saw it with no preconceptions. It's episodic but compelling. Harrelson is GREAT in the title role. He does not turn Flynt into a saint--he's portrayed as obnoxious, controlling and a real jerk at times. However he does make it clear that "Hustler" should not be banned or considered obscene and he makes his case well. Most of it is through his lawyer Alan Isaacman (Edward Norton) who's very good in his role. But top acting honors go to Love who is just incredible as Althea. You see her character very convincingly age during the movie and you see her love and frustration with Flynt. Just a great performance which was totally ignored at the Academy Awards. Also it was great to see great character actors like Crispin Glover, Vincent Schiavelli and James Cromwell in small roles. It was well-directed by Milos Forman and shows the decades it takes place in very well. (There's fantastic use of the 1970s song "Dream Weaver") It's just a little bit overlong. The multiple court sequences get repetitious by hammering the same concepts to us again and again. Also it gets VERY depressing during it's last hour or so. Still, I found it fascinating and compelling. You may not like Flynt or his magazine but it makes a good case for admiring him for what he was fighting for. I give it an 8.

    Woody Harrelson delivers his best performance in director Milos Foreman's tragic true story, The people vs. Larry Flint. All of the actors give their best in this occasionally funny and sad true story. Woody Harrelson gives his best as Larry Flint, who starts the film off with owning a strip club with his brother. Then, Larry comes up with the idea for "Hustler" magazine,which i'm sure everyone has heard of. The film starts off sort of fun. But it takes a tragic turn when he is arrested. And after his arrest, his marriage to his stripper wife(Courtney Love, giving the most realistic and greatest performance of all) falls apart,and they try to find as many ways to arrest him as possible. I can't forget the performance by Edward Norton. Norton gives a lovable performance in everything he's in. Even if he's playing a bad guy he's lovable. And his performance here is both lovable and real. What a sad film. Really, it is. America destroyed Larry Flint. And it's tragic to watch cause the majority of the characters are so likable. And it's very sad to see all of their lives slowly fall apart throughout the years. The people vs. Larry Flint is a fantastic.It's funny,sad,powerful, and well acted. Courtney Love gives us the best performance in the film. Yes,better than Edward Norton. This is a forgotten classic that must be seen. The people vs. Larry Flint:4/4

    Milos Forman's biographic drama, though a little dragging and momentumless towards the middle, is a well-made movie, with incredible acting to steer it through. The movie misses the point, and tries to portray Mr.Larry Flynt as such a likable honest man. Larry Flynt, who had countless number of wives and divorces, whose ex-wives claim he was a beater, whose own daughter accused him of sexual abuse, who disowned his own daughter, whose magazines are a bit too sexist... is idealized a bit too much in the movie. But for what purpose? Why not show him the way he is? The whole point is to concentrate on the importance of the first amendment; no matter what kind of person it is, and what he/she is trying to express, the amendment gives them the freedom to do so. If the story was told from the neutral point of view of the lawyer (played by Edward Norton), with the magazines and the religious institutions on either side, it would have made a more compelling point. The acting is top-notch, and the only thin which holds the movie together. Woody Harrelson is a delight to watch, and Courtney Love is surprisingly good in her acting. Mr. Nortan does a charming supporting role.

    Courtney Love is the worst part of this movie. She's terrible, hard to stomach, and can't act to save her life. THAT SAID.... This is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and it really makes you think about what it means to live in the USA. For those of you out there reading this review who do not live in the USA, you've no doubt heard about how we Americans like to pride ourselves for being so freaking awesome... until someone points out how backwards and self-absorbed we really are. That's not to say Americans are bad (quite the contrary), but we definitely have a problem admitting when we're wrong. This movie makes no apologies, and goes straight for the jugular. And thanks to Milos Foreman, and Larry Flynt himself, this movie asks us to consider just how fundamental the right of free speech, and the freedom of expression, is to society. And yes, it relates to hardcore porn. Without delving too much into the technical aspects of the movie, let me just say that if you watch the Edward Norton courtroom scenes (the first where Larry Flynt himself is the judge, and the last one when he's arguing to the Supreme Court), and the epic speech our protagonist gives on "sex versus death," you are going to start developing opinions. It is going to make you think, and it might challenge your comfort zone. And for all those reasons, this movie is worth every moment of your time... including those painful scenes involving Courtney Love. I still think about this movie sometimes, whenever I hear people arguing about their First Amendment rights. Larry Flynt might not be a knight in shining armor, so to speak, but what he stands for is more than just porn - it's freedom of expression, and Americans have to accept that that doesn't necessarily mean something tame or conservative. It's an important lesson, and a movie that should not be missed.

    "The People Vs. Larry Flynt" is a film that might make you angry, or it may make you glad that we, as Americans, have the most cherished right any person could ask for: The freedom to voice an opinion or an idea, regardless of how unpopular or unappealing it may be. So it is with the true story of Larry Flynt, notorious publisher of the porn magazine "Hustler". It is essential to know that at no time does "People vs. Larry Flynt" try to depict it's title character as a saint, or a hero, or even someone you'd take to a family picnic. Flynt, by his own admission, acknowledges that he, and his magazine and it's content is the most provocative and blatant of it's kind in the field of pornographic material. But even more importantly is Flynt's assertion that if the First Amendment can protect someone like him, then it can protect each and every one of us who call ourselves Americans and our citizens' rights, for which countless men have fought and died to preserve. (Just for the record, I myself don't particularly care for pornographic material, but that's MY choice. I do not want nor will I abide any federal, state or local government invading MY life, telling me what I CAN or CANNOT partake of. If you want to talk about obscenity, I put it to you, dear reader, that the most obscene act a government can perform is to control the thoughts and words and ideas of it's own people. To do so is to hearken back to the days of Hitler, and other "thought police" who attempted to regulate free speech and independent thought. OK, rant over.) As to the film itself, the easiest way to describe it is that this is a top notch biographical story, filled with five star performances all around. Woody Harrelson, playing Flynt, does perhaps some of his greatest film work. Ed Norton, who plays Flynt's attorney, turns in yet another stellar job, and Courtney Love, who plays Flynt's wife, dazzles us by displaying, ironically enough, most of the same qualities that actually made her infamous in her own personal life. In the context of this film, however, those negatives of Love are exactly what was needed to recreate this character. The story, in a nutshell, southern Ohio club owner Larry Flynt gets the bright idea to base a magazine off of the type of entertainment he provides at his clubs. The magazine becomes a sensation, but also a perpetual target of moralistic crusaders who believe that material such as that produced by Flynt has no place anywhere in society; at least, in their eyes at any rate. And there is the conflict which drives this movie. Obscenity vs. Free Speech. Director Milos Forman gives us both sides of this argument throughout the film, but drives home the point that "American freedom" includes allowing others to voice opinions or present concepts that, while offensive and repulsive to some, are still just as worthy of protection as any other American's right to say what he or she feels. We follow Larry and his contemporaries through the rags to riches journey, and the ensuing attacks upon it by those who sternly disagree based on their own personal tastes. And "personal taste" is subjective, and therefore cannot be regulated to only one viewpoint. Late in the film, Flynt's case is brought before no less then the Supreme Court, stemming from an earlier court battle with evangelist Jerry Falwell. The ensuing decision from the High Court, which I'll leave for you to see for yourself, defines the very nature of the prospect of freedom of speech, and more importantly, the most rudimentary of basic civil rights as we know them in the United States. Whether you like or hate Larry Flynt, Hustler Magazine, or pornography of any kind is irrelevant. What one must accept if they wish to abide by our constitution, is the inalienable right of every man and woman to be free individuals in terms of their opinions, expressions and thoughts. To do otherwise is a slap in the face to every person who has ever fought for the American way. "The People Vs. Larry Flynt" is a magnificent tale of not just one man's fight for the freedom of speech, but the entire thought process of how strongly we wish to continue to be a free country. Watch it, and be glad you're an American with rights.

    The life of Hustler publisher Larry Flynt has almost too much good material. It's one thing to grow up selling moonshine, buy up some strip clubs and launch one of the most explicit pornography magazines ever created. It's another to also be a one-time born-again Christian, bipolar painkiller addict and the unsuspecting bastion of First Amendment liberties. As such, watching "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is like watching at least three different movies: You have the rise of the boundary-pushing magazine editor, the drug-addled romance and the courtroom drama. So many events in Flynt's life and facets to his personality warrant a deeper look, yet there's just no time. Writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewksi and of course two-time Oscar-winning director Milos Foreman make the most of each part, but the whole product lacks the unity of a masterful biography. At the time, Woody Harrelson proved a curious choice to play Flynt, but he nails the bipolar aspects of the master pornographer. We have so much trouble determining his motives, digging for some sign of logical thought. In most cases, this makes for a frustrating case study, for which you might normally blame the actor for not taking us deep enough. Considering how the film jumps from one aspect of Flynt's life to the next in addition to how completely unpredictable of a character he is, Harrelson deserves praise. He keeps you on your toes like the crazy uncle who jokes so much you can't tell when he's really serious. Then there's Courtney Love. Playing Flynt's stripper girlfriend-turned-wife, Althea, Love gives Foreman more than he bargained for. Hiring a drug addict to play a drug addict is a dangerous game, and not when it comes to working with that person. It's tough to divorce love from Althea, such a controversial public figure at the time and even to some extent to this day. She's frighteningly real as Althea at some points, especially once she starts mooching off Flynt's painkillers after the assassination attempt. Some of the most compelling drama in the film comes in the courtroom scenes. Those fascinated to any extent with free speech law and censorship will crave more from "The People vs. Larry Flynt," especially when the title seems to promise it in higher doses. Edward Norton nabbed a career-making role as Flynt's attorney, Alan Isaacman. Getting noticed by Milos Foreman and Woody Allen ("Everyone Says I Love You") at the same time is pretty impressive. He delivers an expert closing argument in the film's first trial that will have you convinced he wins the case, as well as a powerful yet light-hearted opening speech in the Supreme Court's hearing of the infamous Flynt vs. Falwell case, a landmark win for First Amendment rights. "The People vs. Larry Flynt" touches on so many fascinating aspects of this enigmatic figure, but it sacrifices some depth and consequently the emotional pull. Flynt's life blurs by, and though the writing compensates with some nice transitions, there's no substitute for getting Q.T. with Flynt. The Hustler empire appears to be built in a day a scene in which Flynt tells a photographer that "a woman's vagina has as much personality as her face" is the most insight we get into his mind as editor. Good writing there, but a fleeting moment in the bigger picture. The second half of the film, essentially Larry's life after becoming a paraplegic, feels so radically different. Larry's stroke garbles his speech and Althea's addiction has her looking like a flying monkey in the "Wizard of Oz." Two people who once seemed to have their wits about them become such filthy and disturbed characters. At that point you start to identify with Norton's character instead, as he's the only one who understands the balance between defending free speech and making a complete mockery of the judicial system. You'll want this film to be more of everything, particularly of Flynt as the unorthodox crusader for free speech and the magazine publisher who works the line between genius and insanity. The individual moments or scenes of such captivate, but get lost on the whole. The challenge of boiling a fascinating man's life down to a series of striking moments can sometimes be too immense for even the best of filmmakers. ~Steven C Thanks for reading!

    "If the First Amendment will protect a scumbag like me, then it'll protect all of you -- 'cause I'm the worst," declares Hustler Magazine publisher Larry Flynt in the midst of one of his many court cases. The People vs. Larry Flynt is a biographical drama film directed by Milo Forman about the rise of pornographic magazine publisher and editor Larry Flynt, and his subsequent clash with the law. The film stars Woody Harrelson, Courtney Love, and Edward Norton.The film was written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. It spans about 25 years of Flynt's life from his impoverished upbringing in Kentucky to his court battle with Reverend Jerry Falwell, and is based in part on the U.S. Supreme Court case Hustler Magazine v. Falwell. Forman's film follows Flynt from his childhood in Kentucky, where he made extra money for his dirt-poor family by selling the moonshine his father brewed, into adulthood as he manages a strip club in Cincinnati. While the club does middling business, the experience changes Flynt's life in two ways: he meets Althea, an exotic dancer who becomes the love of his life, and he gets the bright idea of starting a magazine to promote the club. Marketed as a crasser, less pretentious alternative to Playboy or Penthouse, Hustler becomes a huge success after Flynt runs a photo series of Jacqueline Onassis sunbathing nude. However, while plenty of people are buying Hustler, there are also plenty of people who don't care for it, including Charles Keating, leader of a watchdog group called Citizens For Decent Literature. Keating spearheads the first of many legal attacks on the magazine, one of which reaches the Supreme Court as Alan Isaacman, Flynt's lawyer, debates the finer legal points of bad taste with the justices of the highest court in the land. Meanwhile, Flynt makes a fortune, loses the use of his legs after an attack by a sniper, embraces and than abandons Christianity, and eventually loses Althea, who succumbs to AIDS after a long addiction to drugs. A brave, spectacularly entertaining -- and unexpectedly stirring -- account of Flynt's life that asks us to regard the publisher of Hustler magazine as an invaluable champion of our First Amendment freedoms.It's a modern-day Capra film, about an unorthodox businessman who's persecuted for his originality but eventually is recognized for the lovable, rugged American individualist he truly is.Woody Harrelson plays Flynt with energy, and Courtney Love does at least as well as his wife.And special mention also goes to Edward Norton.The screenplay, by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, is rich in detail and dialogue.But still,the movie is not compelling enough to generate interest and great entertainment to the viewer.But still,it is a good movie to watch.

    A few years ago, I went to a DVD grocery store, eager to buy Tex Avery's collector DVD box, featuring all his hilarious MGM cartoons. Two cartoons were missing though and I found out they were banned because of racial stereotypes' portrayals on black people, and that they would never be put on DVD, or TV again, despite all the fans' protests and all the petitions: these cartoons were judged too offensive. No offense, but this is just bullshit, the only word to describe this is censorship: pure and simple. And in 2004, its reign of terror wasn't over yet  I'm evoking this anecdote just to highlight the sad reality that we still live in a world governed by a scandalous hypocrisy disguising censorship under the mask of political correctness. Lenny Bruce was censored because of his use of profanity and Larry Flynt for his pornographic images. Now that the Internet trivialized sex, the new taboo is communities. The 21st century is religious, racial, sectary and unfortunately, the fight featured in "The People vs. Larry Flynt" had only changed the field. The War is not over; the nonsense is still governing non-independent media, and we're still brainwashed  This is why "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is probably one of the most important films of the last two decades. It reveals the disastrous sickness that poisons America and Occidental counties in general: Political Correctness, the new dictatorship against every single principle that makes freedom of speech applicable. The message could be summarized in a simple point, in the case of absence of malice, one should make fun, mock, ridicule whatever people, institution, he or she desires. It's not up to the offender to anticipate the harm he will cause, it's up to the offended to accept the idea that whatever allowed one to talk against him, it will allow him to retort, in a satirical, serious or whatever tone he chooses to use. In one word: it's called tolerance. That's exactly why "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is not just a pamphlet written by Milos Forman using profanity, sex, lust, and nudity as so many punctuation marks. It's an inspirational message inviting us to question our approach to tolerance, and not in a preachy way. Larry Flynt is not a model, he's a dirty mind, but as he says, "he's the worst" and as the worst, he'll be the perfect thermometer to measure the acceptance of a country when it comes to the use of humor. But as I also stated in a previous review of Fosse's "Lenny", any simple form of thought is necessarily subversive. Any artistic creation offends a certain established order, otherwise, it's just creation but not Art. Larry Flynt offended, he broke a new taboo, but have we all forgotten that many today's standards were yesterday's taboos?! The philosophical value of "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is undeniable but I guess people were blinded by the profusion of nudity and lust at a point they didn't get how the film is incredibly brilliant in the demonstrations it tries to make ... sometimes in an explicitness I would have judged extreme if the course of the recent events hadn't proved how the point of the film was totally missed. Flynt paved the way to a certain philosophy of freedom that could allow many irreverent entertainers to undermine the image of sacred public, figures or institutions and even, for our delight, respectable cultural figures. But, there's more to that -something that'll make me venerate the film forever- it's the denunciation of an extreme contradiction that could threaten the application of freedom in a whole country: nothing is sacred enough not to be turned into derision. And if one thing shall be sacred, it's this principle. The title sets the mood of the film which is an endless fight through so many judiciary cases involving the 'good people' and Larry Flynt, another title could have been "Larry Flynt, Public Enemy N&deg;1" but this would have been wrong as Flynt had some fans interested on boobs, vagina, and fornication. And in a way, Flynt had done a great service to his country by desensitizing them about the dirtiness of sex. While many citizens were brainwashed to believe that Wars make heroes, in one of the most obscene masquerades that lead American to an humiliating defeat in Nam, Flynt unmasked the ugly face of American pride to reconcile it, with stuff that reaches a lower level ... only to prove there's no reason to feel guilty about loving harmless stuff just because good society says so. Especially when desensitization from violence can have even more devastating effects. And on a technical level, "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is certainly one of the most brilliant scripts ever written swinging between an outrageous and a thought-provoking tone until getting to its point, which is the inspirational denunciation of the hypocrisy governing our world. And freedom of laughing is indeed a way to fight taboos by their own weapons. I did not take Woody Harrelson seriously in the first notes of this brilliant symphony but how wrong I was, he was quite perfect in that role, and I can't go without mentioning Edward Norton as the struggling personal attorney Alan Isaacman, and to conclude Courtney Love in what I consider one of the greatest female performances ever, and I say it again, ONE OF THE GREATEST FEMALE PERFORMANCES EVER, I wonder how she didn't get and win an Oscar. Too trashy? Gimme a break, her devotion and sincere true love towards her husband made Larry's fight so endearing, she was the soul and heart of this film, while Norton was the brain. And Larry was the guts, that despite a tragic handicap was an inspiration to every citizen, to believe in his right to please his basic instincts ... it's basic principles.

    Say what you will about the subject matter of this film, it is very good. The People vs. Larry Flynt is about the creator of Hustler magazine, an extremely racy pornographic magazine that was way ahead of its time, and the legal battles that ensued upon its creation and development. It focuses on aspects of Flynt's home life as well as his business. His offensive magazine was condemned by onslaughts of disgusted American's, and this lead to Larry Flynt being a figurehead in the battle for free speech. The film tells a very interesting story with a colorful cast of odd characters, including the obscene and bizarre protagonist himself. The story that this film tells is not one that you will hear discussed in everyday society. It just isn't something that can easily be brought up, because of its raunchy subject matter. And that's why I enjoyed this movie so much, because it told a surprisingly fascinating story. There was a lot more to this legal battle than meets the eye. There was a surprising amount of aspects to the story that I wasn't expecting. The movie told a very interesting story about a very interesting man. The film covers a lot more ground than is to be expected. It begins with Larry and his brother running a small time strip club. Not long after the movie begins is Hustler created and Flynt begins to thrive. The main focus of the films conflict then starts to arise as Flynt is attacked by naysayers who are disgusted by what he is doing. From here a lot of things happen, some good, others not so good. There is plenty of comedy, drama, and even tragedy in this unorthodox story about a very unorthodox and yet fascinating man. I think I've made it clear that Larry Flynt was a fascinating character to watch unfold in this movie, but that doesn't mean he was a likable one. To put it lightly, Larry Flynt was a jerk in this film. He was vulgar, rude, and obscene. He objectified women and had little to no respect for authority. There were times where he became unbearably obnoxious in the film, but it all played in to what the character was all about. He undoubtedly developed issues as he grew older. He suffered one physical tragedy that left him impaired physically, but also drove his mind into depravity as well. But despite all this, I can't say I disrespect him for being so determined to exercise his first amendment rights. Considering the situation, you really can't argue with the points he makes in the film, whether you agree with him or not. The tagline of the film says it best. You might not like what he does, but are you prepared to give up his right to do it? This sums up what the legal battle the film focuses on is all about. He has the right to do what he does whether you like it or not. The film delivered very interesting battle of wits and morals. The film boasts a fascinating story with a variety of different characters, and it thankfully has the cast to hold up this aspect of the film. Woody Harrelson plays Larry Flynt, and he does an incredible job. Flynt goes through a lot of changes, both physical and mental, throughout the course of the film, and Harrelson conveys those changes extraordinarily well. It is definitely one of his finest leading roles. Courtney Love plays Flynt's wife, Althea. Now, I have absolutely no expect for Courtney Love. She is a disgusting and tasteless woman with no redeeming qualities except for her performance in The People vs. Larry Flynt. As much as I dislike Love, she does a fantastic job as Althea, a troubled and emotional character that isn't easy to access or understand the motives of because she is really just a nutjob. The character is very multi-dimensional, and Courtney Love does a surprising job at conveying it. Edward Norton plays Flynt's lawyer, Alan Isaacman. The character is another very interesting one. He shows how difficult it is to be the lawyer for a deranged man like Larry Flynt, but his will and determination give him an insightful and compelling edge that I really enjoyed. Plus I love Norton in everything he does, so loving him and his character was a no-brainer. I really loved this movie. It isn't perfect but what it delivers is excellent. The narrative has some issues. In the beginning of the film conflicts seem to arise and then just disappear without another word. There are some abrupt cuts that give the film an uneven feel and pacing. But by the end of the film these issues are easily forgivable because of how much I liked the overall story this film delivers. I really liked everything about this film and could easily see past some of its imperfections. The story is unique and interesting, and so are the characters that are portrayed by a great cast. Don't be turned off by this film's subject matter. You don't want to miss it.

    This is most certainly an interesting account of the life of Larry Flynt - the publisher of Hustler Magazine, perhaps the trashiest "mainstream" porn magazine ever published. Beginning with Flynt as a boy selling moonshine to his neighbours, the movie ends with Flynt triumphing over the Reverend Jerry Falwell in a case before the United States Supreme Court. What we see between these two events is disturbing, shocking and sometimes even funny. Flynt is anything but an attractive personality. Evolving from the owner of struggling strip club to a millionaire porn merchant, I suppose one has to respect the man for his ability to achieve his dreams and the triumph against the odds, but the "me against the world" persona wears thin after a while. Flynt comes across through most of this as self-absorbed. He claims to be fighting for the freedom of speech, but one really has the feeling that he's fighting for it not for the sake of anyone but himself. I didn't get the sense from this movie that Flynt had any sort of "greater good" at the forefront of his thoughts, although in fairness he has remained active in this area. There's an interesting look at his temporary conversion to Christianity, and his growing relationship with Ruth Carter Stapleton (Jimmy Carter's sister) who converted him to Christianity, which becomes quite humorous as he struggles within himself to reconcile his newfound faith with his work as a porn publisher. The movie also deals with his rejection of that faith and increasing bitterness after the shooting that left him paralyzed. There's great emphasis placed on his personal life and in particular with his wife Althea, who became a drug addict and an AIDS victim. (Interestingly, there's no reference to the fact that she was his fourth wife.) There are some great performances in this. Woody Harrelson offers a superb portrayal of Flynt (perhaps Harrelson's best acting) - sometimes in total control, other times totally out of control. Courtney Love was totally believable as Althea - devoted to Flynt but rapidly spiralling out of control herself. Edward Norton was fine as Flynt's long- suffering attorney Allan Isaacson. Flynt actually appears in this movie as the judge at his own first trial (at least the first one portrayed in the movie) in Cincinnati. Still, this is a difficult movie. It's fascinating for a while, but becomes a bit tiresome and repetitive after a while. Flynt repeats the same antics over and over again and after a while they lose their impact. The lead up to the court fight against Falwell - who sued him for libel for a satirical article in Hustler that accused him of incest - took up a lot of time, but it was hard to feel passion about it. Neither party is particularly attractive to me. Personally, I think Flynt's depiction of Falwell as a hypocrite was bang-on, but Flynt himself is just not a likable person, and it's hard to root for him against anyone - even Falwell. This is a good account of a life that would have to be described in many contradictory ways: a success story, but a very sad one. The guy who pushes the envelope beyond the breaking point but then objects when anyone pushes back. The guy who stands up for free speech and ends up front and centre in the midst of the battle, except that you kind of wish he wouldn't exercise it for himself. He's a strange guy.

    Movie about Larry Flynt--publisher of "Hustler" magazine. He's played by Woody Harrelson and it follows him from 1972 to the 1980s and deals with him defending his magazine against obscenity charges. It also details his wife Althea (Courtney Love) and their relationship. I've heard this movie was an idealized version of the true story but I knew nothing about Flynt before I saw this movie so I saw it with no preconceptions. It's episodic but compelling. Harrelson is GREAT in the title role. He does not turn Flynt into a saint--he's portrayed as obnoxious, controlling and a real jerk at times. However he does make it clear that "Hustler" should not be banned or considered obscene and he makes his case well. Most of it is through his lawyer Alan Isaacman (Edward Norton) who's very good in his role. But top acting honors go to Love who is just incredible as Althea. You see her character very convincingly age during the movie and you see her love and frustration with Flynt. Just a great performance which was totally ignored at the Academy Awards. Also it was great to see great character actors like Crispin Glover, Vincent Schiavelli and James Cromwell in small roles. It was well-directed by Milos Forman and shows the decades it takes place in very well. (There's fantastic use of the 1970s song "Dream Weaver") It's just a little bit overlong. The multiple court sequences get repetitious by hammering the same concepts to us again and again. Also it gets VERY depressing during it's last hour or so. Still, I found it fascinating and compelling. You may not like Flynt or his magazine but it makes a good case for admiring him for what he was fighting for. I give it an 8.

    Woody Harrelson delivers his best performance in director Milos Foreman's tragic true story, The people vs. Larry Flint. All of the actors give their best in this occasionally funny and sad true story. Woody Harrelson gives his best as Larry Flint, who starts the film off with owning a strip club with his brother. Then, Larry comes up with the idea for "Hustler" magazine,which i'm sure everyone has heard of. The film starts off sort of fun. But it takes a tragic turn when he is arrested. And after his arrest, his marriage to his stripper wife(Courtney Love, giving the most realistic and greatest performance of all) falls apart,and they try to find as many ways to arrest him as possible. I can't forget the performance by Edward Norton. Norton gives a lovable performance in everything he's in. Even if he's playing a bad guy he's lovable. And his performance here is both lovable and real. What a sad film. Really, it is. America destroyed Larry Flint. And it's tragic to watch cause the majority of the characters are so likable. And it's very sad to see all of their lives slowly fall apart throughout the years. The people vs. Larry Flint is a fantastic.It's funny,sad,powerful, and well acted. Courtney Love gives us the best performance in the film. Yes,better than Edward Norton. This is a forgotten classic that must be seen. The people vs. Larry Flint:4/4

    Milos Forman's biographic drama, though a little dragging and momentumless towards the middle, is a well-made movie, with incredible acting to steer it through. The movie misses the point, and tries to portray Mr.Larry Flynt as such a likable honest man. Larry Flynt, who had countless number of wives and divorces, whose ex-wives claim he was a beater, whose own daughter accused him of sexual abuse, who disowned his own daughter, whose magazines are a bit too sexist... is idealized a bit too much in the movie. But for what purpose? Why not show him the way he is? The whole point is to concentrate on the importance of the first amendment; no matter what kind of person it is, and what he/she is trying to express, the amendment gives them the freedom to do so. If the story was told from the neutral point of view of the lawyer (played by Edward Norton), with the magazines and the religious institutions on either side, it would have made a more compelling point. The acting is top-notch, and the only thin which holds the movie together. Woody Harrelson is a delight to watch, and Courtney Love is surprisingly good in her acting. Mr. Nortan does a charming supporting role.

    Courtney Love is the worst part of this movie. She's terrible, hard to stomach, and can't act to save her life. THAT SAID.... This is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and it really makes you think about what it means to live in the USA. For those of you out there reading this review who do not live in the USA, you've no doubt heard about how we Americans like to pride ourselves for being so freaking awesome... until someone points out how backwards and self-absorbed we really are. That's not to say Americans are bad (quite the contrary), but we definitely have a problem admitting when we're wrong. This movie makes no apologies, and goes straight for the jugular. And thanks to Milos Foreman, and Larry Flynt himself, this movie asks us to consider just how fundamental the right of free speech, and the freedom of expression, is to society. And yes, it relates to hardcore porn. Without delving too much into the technical aspects of the movie, let me just say that if you watch the Edward Norton courtroom scenes (the first where Larry Flynt himself is the judge, and the last one when he's arguing to the Supreme Court), and the epic speech our protagonist gives on "sex versus death," you are going to start developing opinions. It is going to make you think, and it might challenge your comfort zone. And for all those reasons, this movie is worth every moment of your time... including those painful scenes involving Courtney Love. I still think about this movie sometimes, whenever I hear people arguing about their First Amendment rights. Larry Flynt might not be a knight in shining armor, so to speak, but what he stands for is more than just porn - it's freedom of expression, and Americans have to accept that that doesn't necessarily mean something tame or conservative. It's an important lesson, and a movie that should not be missed.

    "The People Vs. Larry Flynt" is a film that might make you angry, or it may make you glad that we, as Americans, have the most cherished right any person could ask for: The freedom to voice an opinion or an idea, regardless of how unpopular or unappealing it may be. So it is with the true story of Larry Flynt, notorious publisher of the porn magazine "Hustler". It is essential to know that at no time does "People vs. Larry Flynt" try to depict it's title character as a saint, or a hero, or even someone you'd take to a family picnic. Flynt, by his own admission, acknowledges that he, and his magazine and it's content is the most provocative and blatant of it's kind in the field of pornographic material. But even more importantly is Flynt's assertion that if the First Amendment can protect someone like him, then it can protect each and every one of us who call ourselves Americans and our citizens' rights, for which countless men have fought and died to preserve. (Just for the record, I myself don't particularly care for pornographic material, but that's MY choice. I do not want nor will I abide any federal, state or local government invading MY life, telling me what I CAN or CANNOT partake of. If you want to talk about obscenity, I put it to you, dear reader, that the most obscene act a government can perform is to control the thoughts and words and ideas of it's own people. To do so is to hearken back to the days of Hitler, and other "thought police" who attempted to regulate free speech and independent thought. OK, rant over.) As to the film itself, the easiest way to describe it is that this is a top notch biographical story, filled with five star performances all around. Woody Harrelson, playing Flynt, does perhaps some of his greatest film work. Ed Norton, who plays Flynt's attorney, turns in yet another stellar job, and Courtney Love, who plays Flynt's wife, dazzles us by displaying, ironically enough, most of the same qualities that actually made her infamous in her own personal life. In the context of this film, however, those negatives of Love are exactly what was needed to recreate this character. The story, in a nutshell, southern Ohio club owner Larry Flynt gets the bright idea to base a magazine off of the type of entertainment he provides at his clubs. The magazine becomes a sensation, but also a perpetual target of moralistic crusaders who believe that material such as that produced by Flynt has no place anywhere in society; at least, in their eyes at any rate. And there is the conflict which drives this movie. Obscenity vs. Free Speech. Director Milos Forman gives us both sides of this argument throughout the film, but drives home the point that "American freedom" includes allowing others to voice opinions or present concepts that, while offensive and repulsive to some, are still just as worthy of protection as any other American's right to say what he or she feels. We follow Larry and his contemporaries through the rags to riches journey, and the ensuing attacks upon it by those who sternly disagree based on their own personal tastes. And "personal taste" is subjective, and therefore cannot be regulated to only one viewpoint. Late in the film, Flynt's case is brought before no less then the Supreme Court, stemming from an earlier court battle with evangelist Jerry Falwell. The ensuing decision from the High Court, which I'll leave for you to see for yourself, defines the very nature of the prospect of freedom of speech, and more importantly, the most rudimentary of basic civil rights as we know them in the United States. Whether you like or hate Larry Flynt, Hustler Magazine, or pornography of any kind is irrelevant. What one must accept if they wish to abide by our constitution, is the inalienable right of every man and woman to be free individuals in terms of their opinions, expressions and thoughts. To do otherwise is a slap in the face to every person who has ever fought for the American way. "The People Vs. Larry Flynt" is a magnificent tale of not just one man's fight for the freedom of speech, but the entire thought process of how strongly we wish to continue to be a free country. Watch it, and be glad you're an American with rights.

    The life of Hustler publisher Larry Flynt has almost too much good material. It's one thing to grow up selling moonshine, buy up some strip clubs and launch one of the most explicit pornography magazines ever created. It's another to also be a one-time born-again Christian, bipolar painkiller addict and the unsuspecting bastion of First Amendment liberties. As such, watching "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is like watching at least three different movies: You have the rise of the boundary-pushing magazine editor, the drug-addled romance and the courtroom drama. So many events in Flynt's life and facets to his personality warrant a deeper look, yet there's just no time. Writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewksi and of course two-time Oscar-winning director Milos Foreman make the most of each part, but the whole product lacks the unity of a masterful biography. At the time, Woody Harrelson proved a curious choice to play Flynt, but he nails the bipolar aspects of the master pornographer. We have so much trouble determining his motives, digging for some sign of logical thought. In most cases, this makes for a frustrating case study, for which you might normally blame the actor for not taking us deep enough. Considering how the film jumps from one aspect of Flynt's life to the next in addition to how completely unpredictable of a character he is, Harrelson deserves praise. He keeps you on your toes like the crazy uncle who jokes so much you can't tell when he's really serious. Then there's Courtney Love. Playing Flynt's stripper girlfriend-turned-wife, Althea, Love gives Foreman more than he bargained for. Hiring a drug addict to play a drug addict is a dangerous game, and not when it comes to working with that person. It's tough to divorce love from Althea, such a controversial public figure at the time and even to some extent to this day. She's frighteningly real as Althea at some points, especially once she starts mooching off Flynt's painkillers after the assassination attempt. Some of the most compelling drama in the film comes in the courtroom scenes. Those fascinated to any extent with free speech law and censorship will crave more from "The People vs. Larry Flynt," especially when the title seems to promise it in higher doses. Edward Norton nabbed a career-making role as Flynt's attorney, Alan Isaacman. Getting noticed by Milos Foreman and Woody Allen ("Everyone Says I Love You") at the same time is pretty impressive. He delivers an expert closing argument in the film's first trial that will have you convinced he wins the case, as well as a powerful yet light-hearted opening speech in the Supreme Court's hearing of the infamous Flynt vs. Falwell case, a landmark win for First Amendment rights. "The People vs. Larry Flynt" touches on so many fascinating aspects of this enigmatic figure, but it sacrifices some depth and consequently the emotional pull. Flynt's life blurs by, and though the writing compensates with some nice transitions, there's no substitute for getting Q.T. with Flynt. The Hustler empire appears to be built in a day a scene in which Flynt tells a photographer that "a woman's vagina has as much personality as her face" is the most insight we get into his mind as editor. Good writing there, but a fleeting moment in the bigger picture. The second half of the film, essentially Larry's life after becoming a paraplegic, feels so radically different. Larry's stroke garbles his speech and Althea's addiction has her looking like a flying monkey in the "Wizard of Oz." Two people who once seemed to have their wits about them become such filthy and disturbed characters. At that point you start to identify with Norton's character instead, as he's the only one who understands the balance between defending free speech and making a complete mockery of the judicial system. You'll want this film to be more of everything, particularly of Flynt as the unorthodox crusader for free speech and the magazine publisher who works the line between genius and insanity. The individual moments or scenes of such captivate, but get lost on the whole. The challenge of boiling a fascinating man's life down to a series of striking moments can sometimes be too immense for even the best of filmmakers. ~Steven C Thanks for reading!

    "If the First Amendment will protect a scumbag like me, then it'll protect all of you -- 'cause I'm the worst," declares Hustler Magazine publisher Larry Flynt in the midst of one of his many court cases. The People vs. Larry Flynt is a biographical drama film directed by Milo Forman about the rise of pornographic magazine publisher and editor Larry Flynt, and his subsequent clash with the law. The film stars Woody Harrelson, Courtney Love, and Edward Norton.The film was written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. It spans about 25 years of Flynt's life from his impoverished upbringing in Kentucky to his court battle with Reverend Jerry Falwell, and is based in part on the U.S. Supreme Court case Hustler Magazine v. Falwell. Forman's film follows Flynt from his childhood in Kentucky, where he made extra money for his dirt-poor family by selling the moonshine his father brewed, into adulthood as he manages a strip club in Cincinnati. While the club does middling business, the experience changes Flynt's life in two ways: he meets Althea, an exotic dancer who becomes the love of his life, and he gets the bright idea of starting a magazine to promote the club. Marketed as a crasser, less pretentious alternative to Playboy or Penthouse, Hustler becomes a huge success after Flynt runs a photo series of Jacqueline Onassis sunbathing nude. However, while plenty of people are buying Hustler, there are also plenty of people who don't care for it, including Charles Keating, leader of a watchdog group called Citizens For Decent Literature. Keating spearheads the first of many legal attacks on the magazine, one of which reaches the Supreme Court as Alan Isaacman, Flynt's lawyer, debates the finer legal points of bad taste with the justices of the highest court in the land. Meanwhile, Flynt makes a fortune, loses the use of his legs after an attack by a sniper, embraces and than abandons Christianity, and eventually loses Althea, who succumbs to AIDS after a long addiction to drugs. A brave, spectacularly entertaining -- and unexpectedly stirring -- account of Flynt's life that asks us to regard the publisher of Hustler magazine as an invaluable champion of our First Amendment freedoms.It's a modern-day Capra film, about an unorthodox businessman who's persecuted for his originality but eventually is recognized for the lovable, rugged American individualist he truly is.Woody Harrelson plays Flynt with energy, and Courtney Love does at least as well as his wife.And special mention also goes to Edward Norton.The screenplay, by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, is rich in detail and dialogue.But still,the movie is not compelling enough to generate interest and great entertainment to the viewer.But still,it is a good movie to watch.

    A few years ago, I went to a DVD grocery store, eager to buy Tex Avery's collector DVD box, featuring all his hilarious MGM cartoons. Two cartoons were missing though and I found out they were banned because of racial stereotypes' portrayals on black people, and that they would never be put on DVD, or TV again, despite all the fans' protests and all the petitions: these cartoons were judged too offensive. No offense, but this is just bullshit, the only word to describe this is censorship: pure and simple. And in 2004, its reign of terror wasn't over yet  I'm evoking this anecdote just to highlight the sad reality that we still live in a world governed by a scandalous hypocrisy disguising censorship under the mask of political correctness. Lenny Bruce was censored because of his use of profanity and Larry Flynt for his pornographic images. Now that the Internet trivialized sex, the new taboo is communities. The 21st century is religious, racial, sectary and unfortunately, the fight featured in "The People vs. Larry Flynt" had only changed the field. The War is not over; the nonsense is still governing non-independent media, and we're still brainwashed  This is why "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is probably one of the most important films of the last two decades. It reveals the disastrous sickness that poisons America and Occidental counties in general: Political Correctness, the new dictatorship against every single principle that makes freedom of speech applicable. The message could be summarized in a simple point, in the case of absence of malice, one should make fun, mock, ridicule whatever people, institution, he or she desires. It's not up to the offender to anticipate the harm he will cause, it's up to the offended to accept the idea that whatever allowed one to talk against him, it will allow him to retort, in a satirical, serious or whatever tone he chooses to use. In one word: it's called tolerance. That's exactly why "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is not just a pamphlet written by Milos Forman using profanity, sex, lust, and nudity as so many punctuation marks. It's an inspirational message inviting us to question our approach to tolerance, and not in a preachy way. Larry Flynt is not a model, he's a dirty mind, but as he says, "he's the worst" and as the worst, he'll be the perfect thermometer to measure the acceptance of a country when it comes to the use of humor. But as I also stated in a previous review of Fosse's "Lenny", any simple form of thought is necessarily subversive. Any artistic creation offends a certain established order, otherwise, it's just creation but not Art. Larry Flynt offended, he broke a new taboo, but have we all forgotten that many today's standards were yesterday's taboos?! The philosophical value of "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is undeniable but I guess people were blinded by the profusion of nudity and lust at a point they didn't get how the film is incredibly brilliant in the demonstrations it tries to make ... sometimes in an explicitness I would have judged extreme if the course of the recent events hadn't proved how the point of the film was totally missed. Flynt paved the way to a certain philosophy of freedom that could allow many irreverent entertainers to undermine the image of sacred public, figures or institutions and even, for our delight, respectable cultural figures. But, there's more to that -something that'll make me venerate the film forever- it's the denunciation of an extreme contradiction that could threaten the application of freedom in a whole country: nothing is sacred enough not to be turned into derision. And if one thing shall be sacred, it's this principle. The title sets the mood of the film which is an endless fight through so many judiciary cases involving the 'good people' and Larry Flynt, another title could have been "Larry Flynt, Public Enemy N&deg;1" but this would have been wrong as Flynt had some fans interested on boobs, vagina, and fornication. And in a way, Flynt had done a great service to his country by desensitizing them about the dirtiness of sex. While many citizens were brainwashed to believe that Wars make heroes, in one of the most obscene masquerades that lead American to an humiliating defeat in Nam, Flynt unmasked the ugly face of American pride to reconcile it, with stuff that reaches a lower level ... only to prove there's no reason to feel guilty about loving harmless stuff just because good society says so. Especially when desensitization from violence can have even more devastating effects. And on a technical level, "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is certainly one of the most brilliant scripts ever written swinging between an outrageous and a thought-provoking tone until getting to its point, which is the inspirational denunciation of the hypocrisy governing our world. And freedom of laughing is indeed a way to fight taboos by their own weapons. I did not take Woody Harrelson seriously in the first notes of this brilliant symphony but how wrong I was, he was quite perfect in that role, and I can't go without mentioning Edward Norton as the struggling personal attorney Alan Isaacman, and to conclude Courtney Love in what I consider one of the greatest female performances ever, and I say it again, ONE OF THE GREATEST FEMALE PERFORMANCES EVER, I wonder how she didn't get and win an Oscar. Too trashy? Gimme a break, her devotion and sincere true love towards her husband made Larry's fight so endearing, she was the soul and heart of this film, while Norton was the brain. And Larry was the guts, that despite a tragic handicap was an inspiration to every citizen, to believe in his right to please his basic instincts ... it's basic principles.

    Say what you will about the subject matter of this film, it is very good. The People vs. Larry Flynt is about the creator of Hustler magazine, an extremely racy pornographic magazine that was way ahead of its time, and the legal battles that ensued upon its creation and development. It focuses on aspects of Flynt's home life as well as his business. His offensive magazine was condemned by onslaughts of disgusted American's, and this lead to Larry Flynt being a figurehead in the battle for free speech. The film tells a very interesting story with a colorful cast of odd characters, including the obscene and bizarre protagonist himself. The story that this film tells is not one that you will hear discussed in everyday society. It just isn't something that can easily be brought up, because of its raunchy subject matter. And that's why I enjoyed this movie so much, because it told a surprisingly fascinating story. There was a lot more to this legal battle than meets the eye. There was a surprising amount of aspects to the story that I wasn't expecting. The movie told a very interesting story about a very interesting man. The film covers a lot more ground than is to be expected. It begins with Larry and his brother running a small time strip club. Not long after the movie begins is Hustler created and Flynt begins to thrive. The main focus of the films conflict then starts to arise as Flynt is attacked by naysayers who are disgusted by what he is doing. From here a lot of things happen, some good, others not so good. There is plenty of comedy, drama, and even tragedy in this unorthodox story about a very unorthodox and yet fascinating man. I think I've made it clear that Larry Flynt was a fascinating character to watch unfold in this movie, but that doesn't mean he was a likable one. To put it lightly, Larry Flynt was a jerk in this film. He was vulgar, rude, and obscene. He objectified women and had little to no respect for authority. There were times where he became unbearably obnoxious in the film, but it all played in to what the character was all about. He undoubtedly developed issues as he grew older. He suffered one physical tragedy that left him impaired physically, but also drove his mind into depravity as well. But despite all this, I can't say I disrespect him for being so determined to exercise his first amendment rights. Considering the situation, you really can't argue with the points he makes in the film, whether you agree with him or not. The tagline of the film says it best. You might not like what he does, but are you prepared to give up his right to do it? This sums up what the legal battle the film focuses on is all about. He has the right to do what he does whether you like it or not. The film delivered very interesting battle of wits and morals. The film boasts a fascinating story with a variety of different characters, and it thankfully has the cast to hold up this aspect of the film. Woody Harrelson plays Larry Flynt, and he does an incredible job. Flynt goes through a lot of changes, both physical and mental, throughout the course of the film, and Harrelson conveys those changes extraordinarily well. It is definitely one of his finest leading roles. Courtney Love plays Flynt's wife, Althea. Now, I have absolutely no expect for Courtney Love. She is a disgusting and tasteless woman with no redeeming qualities except for her performance in The People vs. Larry Flynt. As much as I dislike Love, she does a fantastic job as Althea, a troubled and emotional character that isn't easy to access or understand the motives of because she is really just a nutjob. The character is very multi-dimensional, and Courtney Love does a surprising job at conveying it. Edward Norton plays Flynt's lawyer, Alan Isaacman. The character is another very interesting one. He shows how difficult it is to be the lawyer for a deranged man like Larry Flynt, but his will and determination give him an insightful and compelling edge that I really enjoyed. Plus I love Norton in everything he does, so loving him and his character was a no-brainer. I really loved this movie. It isn't perfect but what it delivers is excellent. The narrative has some issues. In the beginning of the film conflicts seem to arise and then just disappear without another word. There are some abrupt cuts that give the film an uneven feel and pacing. But by the end of the film these issues are easily forgivable because of how much I liked the overall story this film delivers. I really liked everything about this film and could easily see past some of its imperfections. The story is unique and interesting, and so are the characters that are portrayed by a great cast. Don't be turned off by this film's subject matter. You don't want to miss it.

    This is most certainly an interesting account of the life of Larry Flynt - the publisher of Hustler Magazine, perhaps the trashiest "mainstream" porn magazine ever published. Beginning with Flynt as a boy selling moonshine to his neighbours, the movie ends with Flynt triumphing over the Reverend Jerry Falwell in a case before the United States Supreme Court. What we see between these two events is disturbing, shocking and sometimes even funny. Flynt is anything but an attractive personality. Evolving from the owner of struggling strip club to a millionaire porn merchant, I suppose one has to respect the man for his ability to achieve his dreams and the triumph against the odds, but the "me against the world" persona wears thin after a while. Flynt comes across through most of this as self-absorbed. He claims to be fighting for the freedom of speech, but one really has the feeling that he's fighting for it not for the sake of anyone but himself. I didn't get the sense from this movie that Flynt had any sort of "greater good" at the forefront of his thoughts, although in fairness he has remained active in this area. There's an interesting look at his temporary conversion to Christianity, and his growing relationship with Ruth Carter Stapleton (Jimmy Carter's sister) who converted him to Christianity, which becomes quite humorous as he struggles within himself to reconcile his newfound faith with his work as a porn publisher. The movie also deals with his rejection of that faith and increasing bitterness after the shooting that left him paralyzed. There's great emphasis placed on his personal life and in particular with his wife Althea, who became a drug addict and an AIDS victim. (Interestingly, there's no reference to the fact that she was his fourth wife.) There are some great performances in this. Woody Harrelson offers a superb portrayal of Flynt (perhaps Harrelson's best acting) - sometimes in total control, other times totally out of control. Courtney Love was totally believable as Althea - devoted to Flynt but rapidly spiralling out of control herself. Edward Norton was fine as Flynt's long- suffering attorney Allan Isaacson. Flynt actually appears in this movie as the judge at his own first trial (at least the first one portrayed in the movie) in Cincinnati. Still, this is a difficult movie. It's fascinating for a while, but becomes a bit tiresome and repetitive after a while. Flynt repeats the same antics over and over again and after a while they lose their impact. The lead up to the court fight against Falwell - who sued him for libel for a satirical article in Hustler that accused him of incest - took up a lot of time, but it was hard to feel passion about it. Neither party is particularly attractive to me. Personally, I think Flynt's depiction of Falwell as a hypocrite was bang-on, but Flynt himself is just not a likable person, and it's hard to root for him against anyone - even Falwell. This is a good account of a life that would have to be described in many contradictory ways: a success story, but a very sad one. The guy who pushes the envelope beyond the breaking point but then objects when anyone pushes back. The guy who stands up for free speech and ends up front and centre in the midst of the battle, except that you kind of wish he wouldn't exercise it for himself. He's a strange guy.

    Movie about Larry Flynt--publisher of "Hustler" magazine. He's played by Woody Harrelson and it follows him from 1972 to the 1980s and deals with him defending his magazine against obscenity charges. It also details his wife Althea (Courtney Love) and their relationship. I've heard this movie was an idealized version of the true story but I knew nothing about Flynt before I saw this movie so I saw it with no preconceptions. It's episodic but compelling. Harrelson is GREAT in the title role. He does not turn Flynt into a saint--he's portrayed as obnoxious, controlling and a real jerk at times. However he does make it clear that "Hustler" should not be banned or considered obscene and he makes his case well. Most of it is through his lawyer Alan Isaacman (Edward Norton) who's very good in his role. But top acting honors go to Love who is just incredible as Althea. You see her character very convincingly age during the movie and you see her love and frustration with Flynt. Just a great performance which was totally ignored at the Academy Awards. Also it was great to see great character actors like Crispin Glover, Vincent Schiavelli and James Cromwell in small roles. It was well-directed by Milos Forman and shows the decades it takes place in very well. (There's fantastic use of the 1970s song "Dream Weaver") It's just a little bit overlong. The multiple court sequences get repetitious by hammering the same concepts to us again and again. Also it gets VERY depressing during it's last hour or so. Still, I found it fascinating and compelling. You may not like Flynt or his magazine but it makes a good case for admiring him for what he was fighting for. I give it an 8.

    Woody Harrelson delivers his best performance in director Milos Foreman's tragic true story, The people vs. Larry Flint. All of the actors give their best in this occasionally funny and sad true story. Woody Harrelson gives his best as Larry Flint, who starts the film off with owning a strip club with his brother. Then, Larry comes up with the idea for "Hustler" magazine,which i'm sure everyone has heard of. The film starts off sort of fun. But it takes a tragic turn when he is arrested. And after his arrest, his marriage to his stripper wife(Courtney Love, giving the most realistic and greatest performance of all) falls apart,and they try to find as many ways to arrest him as possible. I can't forget the performance by Edward Norton. Norton gives a lovable performance in everything he's in. Even if he's playing a bad guy he's lovable. And his performance here is both lovable and real. What a sad film. Really, it is. America destroyed Larry Flint. And it's tragic to watch cause the majority of the characters are so likable. And it's very sad to see all of their lives slowly fall apart throughout the years. The people vs. Larry Flint is a fantastic.It's funny,sad,powerful, and well acted. Courtney Love gives us the best performance in the film. Yes,better than Edward Norton. This is a forgotten classic that must be seen. The people vs. Larry Flint:4/4

    Milos Forman's biographic drama, though a little dragging and momentumless towards the middle, is a well-made movie, with incredible acting to steer it through. The movie misses the point, and tries to portray Mr.Larry Flynt as such a likable honest man. Larry Flynt, who had countless number of wives and divorces, whose ex-wives claim he was a beater, whose own daughter accused him of sexual abuse, who disowned his own daughter, whose magazines are a bit too sexist... is idealized a bit too much in the movie. But for what purpose? Why not show him the way he is? The whole point is to concentrate on the importance of the first amendment; no matter what kind of person it is, and what he/she is trying to express, the amendment gives them the freedom to do so. If the story was told from the neutral point of view of the lawyer (played by Edward Norton), with the magazines and the religious institutions on either side, it would have made a more compelling point. The acting is top-notch, and the only thin which holds the movie together. Woody Harrelson is a delight to watch, and Courtney Love is surprisingly good in her acting. Mr. Nortan does a charming supporting role.

    Courtney Love is the worst part of this movie. She's terrible, hard to stomach, and can't act to save her life. THAT SAID.... This is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and it really makes you think about what it means to live in the USA. For those of you out there reading this review who do not live in the USA, you've no doubt heard about how we Americans like to pride ourselves for being so freaking awesome... until someone points out how backwards and self-absorbed we really are. That's not to say Americans are bad (quite the contrary), but we definitely have a problem admitting when we're wrong. This movie makes no apologies, and goes straight for the jugular. And thanks to Milos Foreman, and Larry Flynt himself, this movie asks us to consider just how fundamental the right of free speech, and the freedom of expression, is to society. And yes, it relates to hardcore porn. Without delving too much into the technical aspects of the movie, let me just say that if you watch the Edward Norton courtroom scenes (the first where Larry Flynt himself is the judge, and the last one when he's arguing to the Supreme Court), and the epic speech our protagonist gives on "sex versus death," you are going to start developing opinions. It is going to make you think, and it might challenge your comfort zone. And for all those reasons, this movie is worth every moment of your time... including those painful scenes involving Courtney Love. I still think about this movie sometimes, whenever I hear people arguing about their First Amendment rights. Larry Flynt might not be a knight in shining armor, so to speak, but what he stands for is more than just porn - it's freedom of expression, and Americans have to accept that that doesn't necessarily mean something tame or conservative. It's an important lesson, and a movie that should not be missed.

    "The People Vs. Larry Flynt" is a film that might make you angry, or it may make you glad that we, as Americans, have the most cherished right any person could ask for: The freedom to voice an opinion or an idea, regardless of how unpopular or unappealing it may be. So it is with the true story of Larry Flynt, notorious publisher of the porn magazine "Hustler". It is essential to know that at no time does "People vs. Larry Flynt" try to depict it's title character as a saint, or a hero, or even someone you'd take to a family picnic. Flynt, by his own admission, acknowledges that he, and his magazine and it's content is the most provocative and blatant of it's kind in the field of pornographic material. But even more importantly is Flynt's assertion that if the First Amendment can protect someone like him, then it can protect each and every one of us who call ourselves Americans and our citizens' rights, for which countless men have fought and died to preserve. (Just for the record, I myself don't particularly care for pornographic material, but that's MY choice. I do not want nor will I abide any federal, state or local government invading MY life, telling me what I CAN or CANNOT partake of. If you want to talk about obscenity, I put it to you, dear reader, that the most obscene act a government can perform is to control the thoughts and words and ideas of it's own people. To do so is to hearken back to the days of Hitler, and other "thought police" who attempted to regulate free speech and independent thought. OK, rant over.) As to the film itself, the easiest way to describe it is that this is a top notch biographical story, filled with five star performances all around. Woody Harrelson, playing Flynt, does perhaps some of his greatest film work. Ed Norton, who plays Flynt's attorney, turns in yet another stellar job, and Courtney Love, who plays Flynt's wife, dazzles us by displaying, ironically enough, most of the same qualities that actually made her infamous in her own personal life. In the context of this film, however, those negatives of Love are exactly what was needed to recreate this character. The story, in a nutshell, southern Ohio club owner Larry Flynt gets the bright idea to base a magazine off of the type of entertainment he provides at his clubs. The magazine becomes a sensation, but also a perpetual target of moralistic crusaders who believe that material such as that produced by Flynt has no place anywhere in society; at least, in their eyes at any rate. And there is the conflict which drives this movie. Obscenity vs. Free Speech. Director Milos Forman gives us both sides of this argument throughout the film, but drives home the point that "American freedom" includes allowing others to voice opinions or present concepts that, while offensive and repulsive to some, are still just as worthy of protection as any other American's right to say what he or she feels. We follow Larry and his contemporaries through the rags to riches journey, and the ensuing attacks upon it by those who sternly disagree based on their own personal tastes. And "personal taste" is subjective, and therefore cannot be regulated to only one viewpoint. Late in the film, Flynt's case is brought before no less then the Supreme Court, stemming from an earlier court battle with evangelist Jerry Falwell. The ensuing decision from the High Court, which I'll leave for you to see for yourself, defines the very nature of the prospect of freedom of speech, and more importantly, the most rudimentary of basic civil rights as we know them in the United States. Whether you like or hate Larry Flynt, Hustler Magazine, or pornography of any kind is irrelevant. What one must accept if they wish to abide by our constitution, is the inalienable right of every man and woman to be free individuals in terms of their opinions, expressions and thoughts. To do otherwise is a slap in the face to every person who has ever fought for the American way. "The People Vs. Larry Flynt" is a magnificent tale of not just one man's fight for the freedom of speech, but the entire thought process of how strongly we wish to continue to be a free country. Watch it, and be glad you're an American with rights.

    The life of Hustler publisher Larry Flynt has almost too much good material. It's one thing to grow up selling moonshine, buy up some strip clubs and launch one of the most explicit pornography magazines ever created. It's another to also be a one-time born-again Christian, bipolar painkiller addict and the unsuspecting bastion of First Amendment liberties. As such, watching "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is like watching at least three different movies: You have the rise of the boundary-pushing magazine editor, the drug-addled romance and the courtroom drama. So many events in Flynt's life and facets to his personality warrant a deeper look, yet there's just no time. Writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewksi and of course two-time Oscar-winning director Milos Foreman make the most of each part, but the whole product lacks the unity of a masterful biography. At the time, Woody Harrelson proved a curious choice to play Flynt, but he nails the bipolar aspects of the master pornographer. We have so much trouble determining his motives, digging for some sign of logical thought. In most cases, this makes for a frustrating case study, for which you might normally blame the actor for not taking us deep enough. Considering how the film jumps from one aspect of Flynt's life to the next in addition to how completely unpredictable of a character he is, Harrelson deserves praise. He keeps you on your toes like the crazy uncle who jokes so much you can't tell when he's really serious. Then there's Courtney Love. Playing Flynt's stripper girlfriend-turned-wife, Althea, Love gives Foreman more than he bargained for. Hiring a drug addict to play a drug addict is a dangerous game, and not when it comes to working with that person. It's tough to divorce love from Althea, such a controversial public figure at the time and even to some extent to this day. She's frighteningly real as Althea at some points, especially once she starts mooching off Flynt's painkillers after the assassination attempt. Some of the most compelling drama in the film comes in the courtroom scenes. Those fascinated to any extent with free speech law and censorship will crave more from "The People vs. Larry Flynt," especially when the title seems to promise it in higher doses. Edward Norton nabbed a career-making role as Flynt's attorney, Alan Isaacman. Getting noticed by Milos Foreman and Woody Allen ("Everyone Says I Love You") at the same time is pretty impressive. He delivers an expert closing argument in the film's first trial that will have you convinced he wins the case, as well as a powerful yet light-hearted opening speech in the Supreme Court's hearing of the infamous Flynt vs. Falwell case, a landmark win for First Amendment rights. "The People vs. Larry Flynt" touches on so many fascinating aspects of this enigmatic figure, but it sacrifices some depth and consequently the emotional pull. Flynt's life blurs by, and though the writing compensates with some nice transitions, there's no substitute for getting Q.T. with Flynt. The Hustler empire appears to be built in a day a scene in which Flynt tells a photographer that "a woman's vagina has as much personality as her face" is the most insight we get into his mind as editor. Good writing there, but a fleeting moment in the bigger picture. The second half of the film, essentially Larry's life after becoming a paraplegic, feels so radically different. Larry's stroke garbles his speech and Althea's addiction has her looking like a flying monkey in the "Wizard of Oz." Two people who once seemed to have their wits about them become such filthy and disturbed characters. At that point you start to identify with Norton's character instead, as he's the only one who understands the balance between defending free speech and making a complete mockery of the judicial system. You'll want this film to be more of everything, particularly of Flynt as the unorthodox crusader for free speech and the magazine publisher who works the line between genius and insanity. The individual moments or scenes of such captivate, but get lost on the whole. The challenge of boiling a fascinating man's life down to a series of striking moments can sometimes be too immense for even the best of filmmakers. ~Steven C Thanks for reading!

    "If the First Amendment will protect a scumbag like me, then it'll protect all of you -- 'cause I'm the worst," declares Hustler Magazine publisher Larry Flynt in the midst of one of his many court cases. The People vs. Larry Flynt is a biographical drama film directed by Milo Forman about the rise of pornographic magazine publisher and editor Larry Flynt, and his subsequent clash with the law. The film stars Woody Harrelson, Courtney Love, and Edward Norton.The film was written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. It spans about 25 years of Flynt's life from his impoverished upbringing in Kentucky to his court battle with Reverend Jerry Falwell, and is based in part on the U.S. Supreme Court case Hustler Magazine v. Falwell. Forman's film follows Flynt from his childhood in Kentucky, where he made extra money for his dirt-poor family by selling the moonshine his father brewed, into adulthood as he manages a strip club in Cincinnati. While the club does middling business, the experience changes Flynt's life in two ways: he meets Althea, an exotic dancer who becomes the love of his life, and he gets the bright idea of starting a magazine to promote the club. Marketed as a crasser, less pretentious alternative to Playboy or Penthouse, Hustler becomes a huge success after Flynt runs a photo series of Jacqueline Onassis sunbathing nude. However, while plenty of people are buying Hustler, there are also plenty of people who don't care for it, including Charles Keating, leader of a watchdog group called Citizens For Decent Literature. Keating spearheads the first of many legal attacks on the magazine, one of which reaches the Supreme Court as Alan Isaacman, Flynt's lawyer, debates the finer legal points of bad taste with the justices of the highest court in the land. Meanwhile, Flynt makes a fortune, loses the use of his legs after an attack by a sniper, embraces and than abandons Christianity, and eventually loses Althea, who succumbs to AIDS after a long addiction to drugs. A brave, spectacularly entertaining -- and unexpectedly stirring -- account of Flynt's life that asks us to regard the publisher of Hustler magazine as an invaluable champion of our First Amendment freedoms.It's a modern-day Capra film, about an unorthodox businessman who's persecuted for his originality but eventually is recognized for the lovable, rugged American individualist he truly is.Woody Harrelson plays Flynt with energy, and Courtney Love does at least as well as his wife.And special mention also goes to Edward Norton.The screenplay, by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, is rich in detail and dialogue.But still,the movie is not compelling enough to generate interest and great entertainment to the viewer.But still,it is a good movie to watch.

    A few years ago, I went to a DVD grocery store, eager to buy Tex Avery's collector DVD box, featuring all his hilarious MGM cartoons. Two cartoons were missing though and I found out they were banned because of racial stereotypes' portrayals on black people, and that they would never be put on DVD, or TV again, despite all the fans' protests and all the petitions: these cartoons were judged too offensive. No offense, but this is just bullshit, the only word to describe this is censorship: pure and simple. And in 2004, its reign of terror wasn't over yet  I'm evoking this anecdote just to highlight the sad reality that we still live in a world governed by a scandalous hypocrisy disguising censorship under the mask of political correctness. Lenny Bruce was censored because of his use of profanity and Larry Flynt for his pornographic images. Now that the Internet trivialized sex, the new taboo is communities. The 21st century is religious, racial, sectary and unfortunately, the fight featured in "The People vs. Larry Flynt" had only changed the field. The War is not over; the nonsense is still governing non-independent media, and we're still brainwashed  This is why "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is probably one of the most important films of the last two decades. It reveals the disastrous sickness that poisons America and Occidental counties in general: Political Correctness, the new dictatorship against every single principle that makes freedom of speech applicable. The message could be summarized in a simple point, in the case of absence of malice, one should make fun, mock, ridicule whatever people, institution, he or she desires. It's not up to the offender to anticipate the harm he will cause, it's up to the offended to accept the idea that whatever allowed one to talk against him, it will allow him to retort, in a satirical, serious or whatever tone he chooses to use. In one word: it's called tolerance. That's exactly why "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is not just a pamphlet written by Milos Forman using profanity, sex, lust, and nudity as so many punctuation marks. It's an inspirational message inviting us to question our approach to tolerance, and not in a preachy way. Larry Flynt is not a model, he's a dirty mind, but as he says, "he's the worst" and as the worst, he'll be the perfect thermometer to measure the acceptance of a country when it comes to the use of humor. But as I also stated in a previous review of Fosse's "Lenny", any simple form of thought is necessarily subversive. Any artistic creation offends a certain established order, otherwise, it's just creation but not Art. Larry Flynt offended, he broke a new taboo, but have we all forgotten that many today's standards were yesterday's taboos?! The philosophical value of "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is undeniable but I guess people were blinded by the profusion of nudity and lust at a point they didn't get how the film is incredibly brilliant in the demonstrations it tries to make ... sometimes in an explicitness I would have judged extreme if the course of the recent events hadn't proved how the point of the film was totally missed. Flynt paved the way to a certain philosophy of freedom that could allow many irreverent entertainers to undermine the image of sacred public, figures or institutions and even, for our delight, respectable cultural figures. But, there's more to that -something that'll make me venerate the film forever- it's the denunciation of an extreme contradiction that could threaten the application of freedom in a whole country: nothing is sacred enough not to be turned into derision. And if one thing shall be sacred, it's this principle. The title sets the mood of the film which is an endless fight through so many judiciary cases involving the 'good people' and Larry Flynt, another title could have been "Larry Flynt, Public Enemy N&deg;1" but this would have been wrong as Flynt had some fans interested on boobs, vagina, and fornication. And in a way, Flynt had done a great service to his country by desensitizing them about the dirtiness of sex. While many citizens were brainwashed to believe that Wars make heroes, in one of the most obscene masquerades that lead American to an humiliating defeat in Nam, Flynt unmasked the ugly face of American pride to reconcile it, with stuff that reaches a lower level ... only to prove there's no reason to feel guilty about loving harmless stuff just because good society says so. Especially when desensitization from violence can have even more devastating effects. And on a technical level, "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is certainly one of the most brilliant scripts ever written swinging between an outrageous and a thought-provoking tone until getting to its point, which is the inspirational denunciation of the hypocrisy governing our world. And freedom of laughing is indeed a way to fight taboos by their own weapons. I did not take Woody Harrelson seriously in the first notes of this brilliant symphony but how wrong I was, he was quite perfect in that role, and I can't go without mentioning Edward Norton as the struggling personal attorney Alan Isaacman, and to conclude Courtney Love in what I consider one of the greatest female performances ever, and I say it again, ONE OF THE GREATEST FEMALE PERFORMANCES EVER, I wonder how she didn't get and win an Oscar. Too trashy? Gimme a break, her devotion and sincere true love towards her husband made Larry's fight so endearing, she was the soul and heart of this film, while Norton was the brain. And Larry was the guts, that despite a tragic handicap was an inspiration to every citizen, to believe in his right to please his basic instincts ... it's basic principles.

    Say what you will about the subject matter of this film, it is very good. The People vs. Larry Flynt is about the creator of Hustler magazine, an extremely racy pornographic magazine that was way ahead of its time, and the legal battles that ensued upon its creation and development. It focuses on aspects of Flynt's home life as well as his business. His offensive magazine was condemned by onslaughts of disgusted American's, and this lead to Larry Flynt being a figurehead in the battle for free speech. The film tells a very interesting story with a colorful cast of odd characters, including the obscene and bizarre protagonist himself. The story that this film tells is not one that you will hear discussed in everyday society. It just isn't something that can easily be brought up, because of its raunchy subject matter. And that's why I enjoyed this movie so much, because it told a surprisingly fascinating story. There was a lot more to this legal battle than meets the eye. There was a surprising amount of aspects to the story that I wasn't expecting. The movie told a very interesting story about a very interesting man. The film covers a lot more ground than is to be expected. It begins with Larry and his brother running a small time strip club. Not long after the movie begins is Hustler created and Flynt begins to thrive. The main focus of the films conflict then starts to arise as Flynt is attacked by naysayers who are disgusted by what he is doing. From here a lot of things happen, some good, others not so good. There is plenty of comedy, drama, and even tragedy in this unorthodox story about a very unorthodox and yet fascinating man. I think I've made it clear that Larry Flynt was a fascinating character to watch unfold in this movie, but that doesn't mean he was a likable one. To put it lightly, Larry Flynt was a jerk in this film. He was vulgar, rude, and obscene. He objectified women and had little to no respect for authority. There were times where he became unbearably obnoxious in the film, but it all played in to what the character was all about. He undoubtedly developed issues as he grew older. He suffered one physical tragedy that left him impaired physically, but also drove his mind into depravity as well. But despite all this, I can't say I disrespect him for being so determined to exercise his first amendment rights. Considering the situation, you really can't argue with the points he makes in the film, whether you agree with him or not. The tagline of the film says it best. You might not like what he does, but are you prepared to give up his right to do it? This sums up what the legal battle the film focuses on is all about. He has the right to do what he does whether you like it or not. The film delivered very interesting battle of wits and morals. The film boasts a fascinating story with a variety of different characters, and it thankfully has the cast to hold up this aspect of the film. Woody Harrelson plays Larry Flynt, and he does an incredible job. Flynt goes through a lot of changes, both physical and mental, throughout the course of the film, and Harrelson conveys those changes extraordinarily well. It is definitely one of his finest leading roles. Courtney Love plays Flynt's wife, Althea. Now, I have absolutely no expect for Courtney Love. She is a disgusting and tasteless woman with no redeeming qualities except for her performance in The People vs. Larry Flynt. As much as I dislike Love, she does a fantastic job as Althea, a troubled and emotional character that isn't easy to access or understand the motives of because she is really just a nutjob. The character is very multi-dimensional, and Courtney Love does a surprising job at conveying it. Edward Norton plays Flynt's lawyer, Alan Isaacman. The character is another very interesting one. He shows how difficult it is to be the lawyer for a deranged man like Larry Flynt, but his will and determination give him an insightful and compelling edge that I really enjoyed. Plus I love Norton in everything he does, so loving him and his character was a no-brainer. I really loved this movie. It isn't perfect but what it delivers is excellent. The narrative has some issues. In the beginning of the film conflicts seem to arise and then just disappear without another word. There are some abrupt cuts that give the film an uneven feel and pacing. But by the end of the film these issues are easily forgivable because of how much I liked the overall story this film delivers. I really liked everything about this film and could easily see past some of its imperfections. The story is unique and interesting, and so are the characters that are portrayed by a great cast. Don't be turned off by this film's subject matter. You don't want to miss it.

    This is most certainly an interesting account of the life of Larry Flynt - the publisher of Hustler Magazine, perhaps the trashiest "mainstream" porn magazine ever published. Beginning with Flynt as a boy selling moonshine to his neighbours, the movie ends with Flynt triumphing over the Reverend Jerry Falwell in a case before the United States Supreme Court. What we see between these two events is disturbing, shocking and sometimes even funny. Flynt is anything but an attractive personality. Evolving from the owner of struggling strip club to a millionaire porn merchant, I suppose one has to respect the man for his ability to achieve his dreams and the triumph against the odds, but the "me against the world" persona wears thin after a while. Flynt comes across through most of this as self-absorbed. He claims to be fighting for the freedom of speech, but one really has the feeling that he's fighting for it not for the sake of anyone but himself. I didn't get the sense from this movie that Flynt had any sort of "greater good" at the forefront of his thoughts, although in fairness he has remained active in this area. There's an interesting look at his temporary conversion to Christianity, and his growing relationship with Ruth Carter Stapleton (Jimmy Carter's sister) who converted him to Christianity, which becomes quite humorous as he struggles within himself to reconcile his newfound faith with his work as a porn publisher. The movie also deals with his rejection of that faith and increasing bitterness after the shooting that left him paralyzed. There's great emphasis placed on his personal life and in particular with his wife Althea, who became a drug addict and an AIDS victim. (Interestingly, there's no reference to the fact that she was his fourth wife.) There are some great performances in this. Woody Harrelson offers a superb portrayal of Flynt (perhaps Harrelson's best acting) - sometimes in total control, other times totally out of control. Courtney Love was totally believable as Althea - devoted to Flynt but rapidly spiralling out of control herself. Edward Norton was fine as Flynt's long- suffering attorney Allan Isaacson. Flynt actually appears in this movie as the judge at his own first trial (at least the first one portrayed in the movie) in Cincinnati. Still, this is a difficult movie. It's fascinating for a while, but becomes a bit tiresome and repetitive after a while. Flynt repeats the same antics over and over again and after a while they lose their impact. The lead up to the court fight against Falwell - who sued him for libel for a satirical article in Hustler that accused him of incest - took up a lot of time, but it was hard to feel passion about it. Neither party is particularly attractive to me. Personally, I think Flynt's depiction of Falwell as a hypocrite was bang-on, but Flynt himself is just not a likable person, and it's hard to root for him against anyone - even Falwell. This is a good account of a life that would have to be described in many contradictory ways: a success story, but a very sad one. The guy who pushes the envelope beyond the breaking point but then objects when anyone pushes back. The guy who stands up for free speech and ends up front and centre in the midst of the battle, except that you kind of wish he wouldn't exercise it for himself. He's a strange guy.

    Movie about Larry Flynt--publisher of "Hustler" magazine. He's played by Woody Harrelson and it follows him from 1972 to the 1980s and deals with him defending his magazine against obscenity charges. It also details his wife Althea (Courtney Love) and their relationship. I've heard this movie was an idealized version of the true story but I knew nothing about Flynt before I saw this movie so I saw it with no preconceptions. It's episodic but compelling. Harrelson is GREAT in the title role. He does not turn Flynt into a saint--he's portrayed as obnoxious, controlling and a real jerk at times. However he does make it clear that "Hustler" should not be banned or considered obscene and he makes his case well. Most of it is through his lawyer Alan Isaacman (Edward Norton) who's very good in his role. But top acting honors go to Love who is just incredible as Althea. You see her character very convincingly age during the movie and you see her love and frustration with Flynt. Just a great performance which was totally ignored at the Academy Awards. Also it was great to see great character actors like Crispin Glover, Vincent Schiavelli and James Cromwell in small roles. It was well-directed by Milos Forman and shows the decades it takes place in very well. (There's fantastic use of the 1970s song "Dream Weaver") It's just a little bit overlong. The multiple court sequences get repetitious by hammering the same concepts to us again and again. Also it gets VERY depressing during it's last hour or so. Still, I found it fascinating and compelling. You may not like Flynt or his magazine but it makes a good case for admiring him for what he was fighting for. I give it an 8.

    Woody Harrelson delivers his best performance in director Milos Foreman's tragic true story, The people vs. Larry Flint. All of the actors give their best in this occasionally funny and sad true story. Woody Harrelson gives his best as Larry Flint, who starts the film off with owning a strip club with his brother. Then, Larry comes up with the idea for "Hustler" magazine,which i'm sure everyone has heard of. The film starts off sort of fun. But it takes a tragic turn when he is arrested. And after his arrest, his marriage to his stripper wife(Courtney Love, giving the most realistic and greatest performance of all) falls apart,and they try to find as many ways to arrest him as possible. I can't forget the performance by Edward Norton. Norton gives a lovable performance in everything he's in. Even if he's playing a bad guy he's lovable. And his performance here is both lovable and real. What a sad film. Really, it is. America destroyed Larry Flint. And it's tragic to watch cause the majority of the characters are so likable. And it's very sad to see all of their lives slowly fall apart throughout the years. The people vs. Larry Flint is a fantastic.It's funny,sad,powerful, and well acted. Courtney Love gives us the best performance in the film. Yes,better than Edward Norton. This is a forgotten classic that must be seen. The people vs. Larry Flint:4/4

    Milos Forman's biographic drama, though a little dragging and momentumless towards the middle, is a well-made movie, with incredible acting to steer it through. The movie misses the point, and tries to portray Mr.Larry Flynt as such a likable honest man. Larry Flynt, who had countless number of wives and divorces, whose ex-wives claim he was a beater, whose own daughter accused him of sexual abuse, who disowned his own daughter, whose magazines are a bit too sexist... is idealized a bit too much in the movie. But for what purpose? Why not show him the way he is? The whole point is to concentrate on the importance of the first amendment; no matter what kind of person it is, and what he/she is trying to express, the amendment gives them the freedom to do so. If the story was told from the neutral point of view of the lawyer (played by Edward Norton), with the magazines and the religious institutions on either side, it would have made a more compelling point. The acting is top-notch, and the only thin which holds the movie together. Woody Harrelson is a delight to watch, and Courtney Love is surprisingly good in her acting. Mr. Nortan does a charming supporting role.

    Courtney Love is the worst part of this movie. She's terrible, hard to stomach, and can't act to save her life. THAT SAID.... This is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and it really makes you think about what it means to live in the USA. For those of you out there reading this review who do not live in the USA, you've no doubt heard about how we Americans like to pride ourselves for being so freaking awesome... until someone points out how backwards and self-absorbed we really are. That's not to say Americans are bad (quite the contrary), but we definitely have a problem admitting when we're wrong. This movie makes no apologies, and goes straight for the jugular. And thanks to Milos Foreman, and Larry Flynt himself, this movie asks us to consider just how fundamental the right of free speech, and the freedom of expression, is to society. And yes, it relates to hardcore porn. Without delving too much into the technical aspects of the movie, let me just say that if you watch the Edward Norton courtroom scenes (the first where Larry Flynt himself is the judge, and the last one when he's arguing to the Supreme Court), and the epic speech our protagonist gives on "sex versus death," you are going to start developing opinions. It is going to make you think, and it might challenge your comfort zone. And for all those reasons, this movie is worth every moment of your time... including those painful scenes involving Courtney Love. I still think about this movie sometimes, whenever I hear people arguing about their First Amendment rights. Larry Flynt might not be a knight in shining armor, so to speak, but what he stands for is more than just porn - it's freedom of expression, and Americans have to accept that that doesn't necessarily mean something tame or conservative. It's an important lesson, and a movie that should not be missed.

    "The People Vs. Larry Flynt" is a film that might make you angry, or it may make you glad that we, as Americans, have the most cherished right any person could ask for: The freedom to voice an opinion or an idea, regardless of how unpopular or unappealing it may be. So it is with the true story of Larry Flynt, notorious publisher of the porn magazine "Hustler". It is essential to know that at no time does "People vs. Larry Flynt" try to depict it's title character as a saint, or a hero, or even someone you'd take to a family picnic. Flynt, by his own admission, acknowledges that he, and his magazine and it's content is the most provocative and blatant of it's kind in the field of pornographic material. But even more importantly is Flynt's assertion that if the First Amendment can protect someone like him, then it can protect each and every one of us who call ourselves Americans and our citizens' rights, for which countless men have fought and died to preserve. (Just for the record, I myself don't particularly care for pornographic material, but that's MY choice. I do not want nor will I abide any federal, state or local government invading MY life, telling me what I CAN or CANNOT partake of. If you want to talk about obscenity, I put it to you, dear reader, that the most obscene act a government can perform is to control the thoughts and words and ideas of it's own people. To do so is to hearken back to the days of Hitler, and other "thought police" who attempted to regulate free speech and independent thought. OK, rant over.) As to the film itself, the easiest way to describe it is that this is a top notch biographical story, filled with five star performances all around. Woody Harrelson, playing Flynt, does perhaps some of his greatest film work. Ed Norton, who plays Flynt's attorney, turns in yet another stellar job, and Courtney Love, who plays Flynt's wife, dazzles us by displaying, ironically enough, most of the same qualities that actually made her infamous in her own personal life. In the context of this film, however, those negatives of Love are exactly what was needed to recreate this character. The story, in a nutshell, southern Ohio club owner Larry Flynt gets the bright idea to base a magazine off of the type of entertainment he provides at his clubs. The magazine becomes a sensation, but also a perpetual target of moralistic crusaders who believe that material such as that produced by Flynt has no place anywhere in society; at least, in their eyes at any rate. And there is the conflict which drives this movie. Obscenity vs. Free Speech. Director Milos Forman gives us both sides of this argument throughout the film, but drives home the point that "American freedom" includes allowing others to voice opinions or present concepts that, while offensive and repulsive to some, are still just as worthy of protection as any other American's right to say what he or she feels. We follow Larry and his contemporaries through the rags to riches journey, and the ensuing attacks upon it by those who sternly disagree based on their own personal tastes. And "personal taste" is subjective, and therefore cannot be regulated to only one viewpoint. Late in the film, Flynt's case is brought before no less then the Supreme Court, stemming from an earlier court battle with evangelist Jerry Falwell. The ensuing decision from the High Court, which I'll leave for you to see for yourself, defines the very nature of the prospect of freedom of speech, and more importantly, the most rudimentary of basic civil rights as we know them in the United States. Whether you like or hate Larry Flynt, Hustler Magazine, or pornography of any kind is irrelevant. What one must accept if they wish to abide by our constitution, is the inalienable right of every man and woman to be free individuals in terms of their opinions, expressions and thoughts. To do otherwise is a slap in the face to every person who has ever fought for the American way. "The People Vs. Larry Flynt" is a magnificent tale of not just one man's fight for the freedom of speech, but the entire thought process of how strongly we wish to continue to be a free country. Watch it, and be glad you're an American with rights.

    The life of Hustler publisher Larry Flynt has almost too much good material. It's one thing to grow up selling moonshine, buy up some strip clubs and launch one of the most explicit pornography magazines ever created. It's another to also be a one-time born-again Christian, bipolar painkiller addict and the unsuspecting bastion of First Amendment liberties. As such, watching "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is like watching at least three different movies: You have the rise of the boundary-pushing magazine editor, the drug-addled romance and the courtroom drama. So many events in Flynt's life and facets to his personality warrant a deeper look, yet there's just no time. Writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewksi and of course two-time Oscar-winning director Milos Foreman make the most of each part, but the whole product lacks the unity of a masterful biography. At the time, Woody Harrelson proved a curious choice to play Flynt, but he nails the bipolar aspects of the master pornographer. We have so much trouble determining his motives, digging for some sign of logical thought. In most cases, this makes for a frustrating case study, for which you might normally blame the actor for not taking us deep enough. Considering how the film jumps from one aspect of Flynt's life to the next in addition to how completely unpredictable of a character he is, Harrelson deserves praise. He keeps you on your toes like the crazy uncle who jokes so much you can't tell when he's really serious. Then there's Courtney Love. Playing Flynt's stripper girlfriend-turned-wife, Althea, Love gives Foreman more than he bargained for. Hiring a drug addict to play a drug addict is a dangerous game, and not when it comes to working with that person. It's tough to divorce love from Althea, such a controversial public figure at the time and even to some extent to this day. She's frighteningly real as Althea at some points, especially once she starts mooching off Flynt's painkillers after the assassination attempt. Some of the most compelling drama in the film comes in the courtroom scenes. Those fascinated to any extent with free speech law and censorship will crave more from "The People vs. Larry Flynt," especially when the title seems to promise it in higher doses. Edward Norton nabbed a career-making role as Flynt's attorney, Alan Isaacman. Getting noticed by Milos Foreman and Woody Allen ("Everyone Says I Love You") at the same time is pretty impressive. He delivers an expert closing argument in the film's first trial that will have you convinced he wins the case, as well as a powerful yet light-hearted opening speech in the Supreme Court's hearing of the infamous Flynt vs. Falwell case, a landmark win for First Amendment rights. "The People vs. Larry Flynt" touches on so many fascinating aspects of this enigmatic figure, but it sacrifices some depth and consequently the emotional pull. Flynt's life blurs by, and though the writing compensates with some nice transitions, there's no substitute for getting Q.T. with Flynt. The Hustler empire appears to be built in a day a scene in which Flynt tells a photographer that "a woman's vagina has as much personality as her face" is the most insight we get into his mind as editor. Good writing there, but a fleeting moment in the bigger picture. The second half of the film, essentially Larry's life after becoming a paraplegic, feels so radically different. Larry's stroke garbles his speech and Althea's addiction has her looking like a flying monkey in the "Wizard of Oz." Two people who once seemed to have their wits about them become such filthy and disturbed characters. At that point you start to identify with Norton's character instead, as he's the only one who understands the balance between defending free speech and making a complete mockery of the judicial system. You'll want this film to be more of everything, particularly of Flynt as the unorthodox crusader for free speech and the magazine publisher who works the line between genius and insanity. The individual moments or scenes of such captivate, but get lost on the whole. The challenge of boiling a fascinating man's life down to a series of striking moments can sometimes be too immense for even the best of filmmakers. ~Steven C Thanks for reading!

    "If the First Amendment will protect a scumbag like me, then it'll protect all of you -- 'cause I'm the worst," declares Hustler Magazine publisher Larry Flynt in the midst of one of his many court cases. The People vs. Larry Flynt is a biographical drama film directed by Milo Forman about the rise of pornographic magazine publisher and editor Larry Flynt, and his subsequent clash with the law. The film stars Woody Harrelson, Courtney Love, and Edward Norton.The film was written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. It spans about 25 years of Flynt's life from his impoverished upbringing in Kentucky to his court battle with Reverend Jerry Falwell, and is based in part on the U.S. Supreme Court case Hustler Magazine v. Falwell. Forman's film follows Flynt from his childhood in Kentucky, where he made extra money for his dirt-poor family by selling the moonshine his father brewed, into adulthood as he manages a strip club in Cincinnati. While the club does middling business, the experience changes Flynt's life in two ways: he meets Althea, an exotic dancer who becomes the love of his life, and he gets the bright idea of starting a magazine to promote the club. Marketed as a crasser, less pretentious alternative to Playboy or Penthouse, Hustler becomes a huge success after Flynt runs a photo series of Jacqueline Onassis sunbathing nude. However, while plenty of people are buying Hustler, there are also plenty of people who don't care for it, including Charles Keating, leader of a watchdog group called Citizens For Decent Literature. Keating spearheads the first of many legal attacks on the magazine, one of which reaches the Supreme Court as Alan Isaacman, Flynt's lawyer, debates the finer legal points of bad taste with the justices of the highest court in the land. Meanwhile, Flynt makes a fortune, loses the use of his legs after an attack by a sniper, embraces and than abandons Christianity, and eventually loses Althea, who succumbs to AIDS after a long addiction to drugs. A brave, spectacularly entertaining -- and unexpectedly stirring -- account of Flynt's life that asks us to regard the publisher of Hustler magazine as an invaluable champion of our First Amendment freedoms.It's a modern-day Capra film, about an unorthodox businessman who's persecuted for his originality but eventually is recognized for the lovable, rugged American individualist he truly is.Woody Harrelson plays Flynt with energy, and Courtney Love does at least as well as his wife.And special mention also goes to Edward Norton.The screenplay, by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, is rich in detail and dialogue.But still,the movie is not compelling enough to generate interest and great entertainment to the viewer.But still,it is a good movie to watch.

    A few years ago, I went to a DVD grocery store, eager to buy Tex Avery's collector DVD box, featuring all his hilarious MGM cartoons. Two cartoons were missing though and I found out they were banned because of racial stereotypes' portrayals on black people, and that they would never be put on DVD, or TV again, despite all the fans' protests and all the petitions: these cartoons were judged too offensive. No offense, but this is just bullshit, the only word to describe this is censorship: pure and simple. And in 2004, its reign of terror wasn't over yet  I'm evoking this anecdote just to highlight the sad reality that we still live in a world governed by a scandalous hypocrisy disguising censorship under the mask of political correctness. Lenny Bruce was censored because of his use of profanity and Larry Flynt for his pornographic images. Now that the Internet trivialized sex, the new taboo is communities. The 21st century is religious, racial, sectary and unfortunately, the fight featured in "The People vs. Larry Flynt" had only changed the field. The War is not over; the nonsense is still governing non-independent media, and we're still brainwashed  This is why "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is probably one of the most important films of the last two decades. It reveals the disastrous sickness that poisons America and Occidental counties in general: Political Correctness, the new dictatorship against every single principle that makes freedom of speech applicable. The message could be summarized in a simple point, in the case of absence of malice, one should make fun, mock, ridicule whatever people, institution, he or she desires. It's not up to the offender to anticipate the harm he will cause, it's up to the offended to accept the idea that whatever allowed one to talk against him, it will allow him to retort, in a satirical, serious or whatever tone he chooses to use. In one word: it's called tolerance. That's exactly why "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is not just a pamphlet written by Milos Forman using profanity, sex, lust, and nudity as so many punctuation marks. It's an inspirational message inviting us to question our approach to tolerance, and not in a preachy way. Larry Flynt is not a model, he's a dirty mind, but as he says, "he's the worst" and as the worst, he'll be the perfect thermometer to measure the acceptance of a country when it comes to the use of humor. But as I also stated in a previous review of Fosse's "Lenny", any simple form of thought is necessarily subversive. Any artistic creation offends a certain established order, otherwise, it's just creation but not Art. Larry Flynt offended, he broke a new taboo, but have we all forgotten that many today's standards were yesterday's taboos?! The philosophical value of "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is undeniable but I guess people were blinded by the profusion of nudity and lust at a point they didn't get how the film is incredibly brilliant in the demonstrations it tries to make ... sometimes in an explicitness I would have judged extreme if the course of the recent events hadn't proved how the point of the film was totally missed. Flynt paved the way to a certain philosophy of freedom that could allow many irreverent entertainers to undermine the image of sacred public, figures or institutions and even, for our delight, respectable cultural figures. But, there's more to that -something that'll make me venerate the film forever- it's the denunciation of an extreme contradiction that could threaten the application of freedom in a whole country: nothing is sacred enough not to be turned into derision. And if one thing shall be sacred, it's this principle. The title sets the mood of the film which is an endless fight through so many judiciary cases involving the 'good people' and Larry Flynt, another title could have been "Larry Flynt, Public Enemy N&deg;1" but this would have been wrong as Flynt had some fans interested on boobs, vagina, and fornication. And in a way, Flynt had done a great service to his country by desensitizing them about the dirtiness of sex. While many citizens were brainwashed to believe that Wars make heroes, in one of the most obscene masquerades that lead American to an humiliating defeat in Nam, Flynt unmasked the ugly face of American pride to reconcile it, with stuff that reaches a lower level ... only to prove there's no reason to feel guilty about loving harmless stuff just because good society says so. Especially when desensitization from violence can have even more devastating effects. And on a technical level, "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is certainly one of the most brilliant scripts ever written swinging between an outrageous and a thought-provoking tone until getting to its point, which is the inspirational denunciation of the hypocrisy governing our world. And freedom of laughing is indeed a way to fight taboos by their own weapons. I did not take Woody Harrelson seriously in the first notes of this brilliant symphony but how wrong I was, he was quite perfect in that role, and I can't go without mentioning Edward Norton as the struggling personal attorney Alan Isaacman, and to conclude Courtney Love in what I consider one of the greatest female performances ever, and I say it again, ONE OF THE GREATEST FEMALE PERFORMANCES EVER, I wonder how she didn't get and win an Oscar. Too trashy? Gimme a break, her devotion and sincere true love towards her husband made Larry's fight so endearing, she was the soul and heart of this film, while Norton was the brain. And Larry was the guts, that despite a tragic handicap was an inspiration to every citizen, to believe in his right to please his basic instincts ... it's basic principles.

    Say what you will about the subject matter of this film, it is very good. The People vs. Larry Flynt is about the creator of Hustler magazine, an extremely racy pornographic magazine that was way ahead of its time, and the legal battles that ensued upon its creation and development. It focuses on aspects of Flynt's home life as well as his business. His offensive magazine was condemned by onslaughts of disgusted American's, and this lead to Larry Flynt being a figurehead in the battle for free speech. The film tells a very interesting story with a colorful cast of odd characters, including the obscene and bizarre protagonist himself. The story that this film tells is not one that you will hear discussed in everyday society. It just isn't something that can easily be brought up, because of its raunchy subject matter. And that's why I enjoyed this movie so much, because it told a surprisingly fascinating story. There was a lot more to this legal battle than meets the eye. There was a surprising amount of aspects to the story that I wasn't expecting. The movie told a very interesting story about a very interesting man. The film covers a lot more ground than is to be expected. It begins with Larry and his brother running a small time strip club. Not long after the movie begins is Hustler created and Flynt begins to thrive. The main focus of the films conflict then starts to arise as Flynt is attacked by naysayers who are disgusted by what he is doing. From here a lot of things happen, some good, others not so good. There is plenty of comedy, drama, and even tragedy in this unorthodox story about a very unorthodox and yet fascinating man. I think I've made it clear that Larry Flynt was a fascinating character to watch unfold in this movie, but that doesn't mean he was a likable one. To put it lightly, Larry Flynt was a jerk in this film. He was vulgar, rude, and obscene. He objectified women and had little to no respect for authority. There were times where he became unbearably obnoxious in the film, but it all played in to what the character was all about. He undoubtedly developed issues as he grew older. He suffered one physical tragedy that left him impaired physically, but also drove his mind into depravity as well. But despite all this, I can't say I disrespect him for being so determined to exercise his first amendment rights. Considering the situation, you really can't argue with the points he makes in the film, whether you agree with him or not. The tagline of the film says it best. You might not like what he does, but are you prepared to give up his right to do it? This sums up what the legal battle the film focuses on is all about. He has the right to do what he does whether you like it or not. The film delivered very interesting battle of wits and morals. The film boasts a fascinating story with a variety of different characters, and it thankfully has the cast to hold up this aspect of the film. Woody Harrelson plays Larry Flynt, and he does an incredible job. Flynt goes through a lot of changes, both physical and mental, throughout the course of the film, and Harrelson conveys those changes extraordinarily well. It is definitely one of his finest leading roles. Courtney Love plays Flynt's wife, Althea. Now, I have absolutely no expect for Courtney Love. She is a disgusting and tasteless woman with no redeeming qualities except for her performance in The People vs. Larry Flynt. As much as I dislike Love, she does a fantastic job as Althea, a troubled and emotional character that isn't easy to access or understand the motives of because she is really just a nutjob. The character is very multi-dimensional, and Courtney Love does a surprising job at conveying it. Edward Norton plays Flynt's lawyer, Alan Isaacman. The character is another very interesting one. He shows how difficult it is to be the lawyer for a deranged man like Larry Flynt, but his will and determination give him an insightful and compelling edge that I really enjoyed. Plus I love Norton in everything he does, so loving him and his character was a no-brainer. I really loved this movie. It isn't perfect but what it delivers is excellent. The narrative has some issues. In the beginning of the film conflicts seem to arise and then just disappear without another word. There are some abrupt cuts that give the film an uneven feel and pacing. But by the end of the film these issues are easily forgivable because of how much I liked the overall story this film delivers. I really liked everything about this film and could easily see past some of its imperfections. The story is unique and interesting, and so are the characters that are portrayed by a great cast. Don't be turned off by this film's subject matter. You don't want to miss it.

    This is most certainly an interesting account of the life of Larry Flynt - the publisher of Hustler Magazine, perhaps the trashiest "mainstream" porn magazine ever published. Beginning with Flynt as a boy selling moonshine to his neighbours, the movie ends with Flynt triumphing over the Reverend Jerry Falwell in a case before the United States Supreme Court. What we see between these two events is disturbing, shocking and sometimes even funny. Flynt is anything but an attractive personality. Evolving from the owner of struggling strip club to a millionaire porn merchant, I suppose one has to respect the man for his ability to achieve his dreams and the triumph against the odds, but the "me against the world" persona wears thin after a while. Flynt comes across through most of this as self-absorbed. He claims to be fighting for the freedom of speech, but one really has the feeling that he's fighting for it not for the sake of anyone but himself. I didn't get the sense from this movie that Flynt had any sort of "greater good" at the forefront of his thoughts, although in fairness he has remained active in this area. There's an interesting look at his temporary conversion to Christianity, and his growing relationship with Ruth Carter Stapleton (Jimmy Carter's sister) who converted him to Christianity, which becomes quite humorous as he struggles within himself to reconcile his newfound faith with his work as a porn publisher. The movie also deals with his rejection of that faith and increasing bitterness after the shooting that left him paralyzed. There's great emphasis placed on his personal life and in particular with his wife Althea, who became a drug addict and an AIDS victim. (Interestingly, there's no reference to the fact that she was his fourth wife.) There are some great performances in this. Woody Harrelson offers a superb portrayal of Flynt (perhaps Harrelson's best acting) - sometimes in total control, other times totally out of control. Courtney Love was totally believable as Althea - devoted to Flynt but rapidly spiralling out of control herself. Edward Norton was fine as Flynt's long- suffering attorney Allan Isaacson. Flynt actually appears in this movie as the judge at his own first trial (at least the first one portrayed in the movie) in Cincinnati. Still, this is a difficult movie. It's fascinating for a while, but becomes a bit tiresome and repetitive after a while. Flynt repeats the same antics over and over again and after a while they lose their impact. The lead up to the court fight against Falwell - who sued him for libel for a satirical article in Hustler that accused him of incest - took up a lot of time, but it was hard to feel passion about it. Neither party is particularly attractive to me. Personally, I think Flynt's depiction of Falwell as a hypocrite was bang-on, but Flynt himself is just not a likable person, and it's hard to root for him against anyone - even Falwell. This is a good account of a life that would have to be described in many contradictory ways: a success story, but a very sad one. The guy who pushes the envelope beyond the breaking point but then objects when anyone pushes back. The guy who stands up for free speech and ends up front and centre in the midst of the battle, except that you kind of wish he wouldn't exercise it for himself. He's a strange guy.

    Movie about Larry Flynt--publisher of "Hustler" magazine. He's played by Woody Harrelson and it follows him from 1972 to the 1980s and deals with him defending his magazine against obscenity charges. It also details his wife Althea (Courtney Love) and their relationship. I've heard this movie was an idealized version of the true story but I knew nothing about Flynt before I saw this movie so I saw it with no preconceptions. It's episodic but compelling. Harrelson is GREAT in the title role. He does not turn Flynt into a saint--he's portrayed as obnoxious, controlling and a real jerk at times. However he does make it clear that "Hustler" should not be banned or considered obscene and he makes his case well. Most of it is through his lawyer Alan Isaacman (Edward Norton) who's very good in his role. But top acting honors go to Love who is just incredible as Althea. You see her character very convincingly age during the movie and you see her love and frustration with Flynt. Just a great performance which was totally ignored at the Academy Awards. Also it was great to see great character actors like Crispin Glover, Vincent Schiavelli and James Cromwell in small roles. It was well-directed by Milos Forman and shows the decades it takes place in very well. (There's fantastic use of the 1970s song "Dream Weaver") It's just a little bit overlong. The multiple court sequences get repetitious by hammering the same concepts to us again and again. Also it gets VERY depressing during it's last hour or so. Still, I found it fascinating and compelling. You may not like Flynt or his magazine but it makes a good case for admiring him for what he was fighting for. I give it an 8.

    Woody Harrelson delivers his best performance in director Milos Foreman's tragic true story, The people vs. Larry Flint. All of the actors give their best in this occasionally funny and sad true story. Woody Harrelson gives his best as Larry Flint, who starts the film off with owning a strip club with his brother. Then, Larry comes up with the idea for "Hustler" magazine,which i'm sure everyone has heard of. The film starts off sort of fun. But it takes a tragic turn when he is arrested. And after his arrest, his marriage to his stripper wife(Courtney Love, giving the most realistic and greatest performance of all) falls apart,and they try to find as many ways to arrest him as possible. I can't forget the performance by Edward Norton. Norton gives a lovable performance in everything he's in. Even if he's playing a bad guy he's lovable. And his performance here is both lovable and real. What a sad film. Really, it is. America destroyed Larry Flint. And it's tragic to watch cause the majority of the characters are so likable. And it's very sad to see all of their lives slowly fall apart throughout the years. The people vs. Larry Flint is a fantastic.It's funny,sad,powerful, and well acted. Courtney Love gives us the best performance in the film. Yes,better than Edward Norton. This is a forgotten classic that must be seen. The people vs. Larry Flint:4/4

    Milos Forman's biographic drama, though a little dragging and momentumless towards the middle, is a well-made movie, with incredible acting to steer it through. The movie misses the point, and tries to portray Mr.Larry Flynt as such a likable honest man. Larry Flynt, who had countless number of wives and divorces, whose ex-wives claim he was a beater, whose own daughter accused him of sexual abuse, who disowned his own daughter, whose magazines are a bit too sexist... is idealized a bit too much in the movie. But for what purpose? Why not show him the way he is? The whole point is to concentrate on the importance of the first amendment; no matter what kind of person it is, and what he/she is trying to express, the amendment gives them the freedom to do so. If the story was told from the neutral point of view of the lawyer (played by Edward Norton), with the magazines and the religious institutions on either side, it would have made a more compelling point. The acting is top-notch, and the only thin which holds the movie together. Woody Harrelson is a delight to watch, and Courtney Love is surprisingly good in her acting. Mr. Nortan does a charming supporting role.

    Courtney Love is the worst part of this movie. She's terrible, hard to stomach, and can't act to save her life. THAT SAID.... This is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and it really makes you think about what it means to live in the USA. For those of you out there reading this review who do not live in the USA, you've no doubt heard about how we Americans like to pride ourselves for being so freaking awesome... until someone points out how backwards and self-absorbed we really are. That's not to say Americans are bad (quite the contrary), but we definitely have a problem admitting when we're wrong. This movie makes no apologies, and goes straight for the jugular. And thanks to Milos Foreman, and Larry Flynt himself, this movie asks us to consider just how fundamental the right of free speech, and the freedom of expression, is to society. And yes, it relates to hardcore porn. Without delving too much into the technical aspects of the movie, let me just say that if you watch the Edward Norton courtroom scenes (the first where Larry Flynt himself is the judge, and the last one when he's arguing to the Supreme Court), and the epic speech our protagonist gives on "sex versus death," you are going to start developing opinions. It is going to make you think, and it might challenge your comfort zone. And for all those reasons, this movie is worth every moment of your time... including those painful scenes involving Courtney Love. I still think about this movie sometimes, whenever I hear people arguing about their First Amendment rights. Larry Flynt might not be a knight in shining armor, so to speak, but what he stands for is more than just porn - it's freedom of expression, and Americans have to accept that that doesn't necessarily mean something tame or conservative. It's an important lesson, and a movie that should not be missed.

    "The People Vs. Larry Flynt" is a film that might make you angry, or it may make you glad that we, as Americans, have the most cherished right any person could ask for: The freedom to voice an opinion or an idea, regardless of how unpopular or unappealing it may be. So it is with the true story of Larry Flynt, notorious publisher of the porn magazine "Hustler". It is essential to know that at no time does "People vs. Larry Flynt" try to depict it's title character as a saint, or a hero, or even someone you'd take to a family picnic. Flynt, by his own admission, acknowledges that he, and his magazine and it's content is the most provocative and blatant of it's kind in the field of pornographic material. But even more importantly is Flynt's assertion that if the First Amendment can protect someone like him, then it can protect each and every one of us who call ourselves Americans and our citizens' rights, for which countless men have fought and died to preserve. (Just for the record, I myself don't particularly care for pornographic material, but that's MY choice. I do not want nor will I abide any federal, state or local government invading MY life, telling me what I CAN or CANNOT partake of. If you want to talk about obscenity, I put it to you, dear reader, that the most obscene act a government can perform is to control the thoughts and words and ideas of it's own people. To do so is to hearken back to the days of Hitler, and other "thought police" who attempted to regulate free speech and independent thought. OK, rant over.) As to the film itself, the easiest way to describe it is that this is a top notch biographical story, filled with five star performances all around. Woody Harrelson, playing Flynt, does perhaps some of his greatest film work. Ed Norton, who plays Flynt's attorney, turns in yet another stellar job, and Courtney Love, who plays Flynt's wife, dazzles us by displaying, ironically enough, most of the same qualities that actually made her infamous in her own personal life. In the context of this film, however, those negatives of Love are exactly what was needed to recreate this character. The story, in a nutshell, southern Ohio club owner Larry Flynt gets the bright idea to base a magazine off of the type of entertainment he provides at his clubs. The magazine becomes a sensation, but also a perpetual target of moralistic crusaders who believe that material such as that produced by Flynt has no place anywhere in society; at least, in their eyes at any rate. And there is the conflict which drives this movie. Obscenity vs. Free Speech. Director Milos Forman gives us both sides of this argument throughout the film, but drives home the point that "American freedom" includes allowing others to voice opinions or present concepts that, while offensive and repulsive to some, are still just as worthy of protection as any other American's right to say what he or she feels. We follow Larry and his contemporaries through the rags to riches journey, and the ensuing attacks upon it by those who sternly disagree based on their own personal tastes. And "personal taste" is subjective, and therefore cannot be regulated to only one viewpoint. Late in the film, Flynt's case is brought before no less then the Supreme Court, stemming from an earlier court battle with evangelist Jerry Falwell. The ensuing decision from the High Court, which I'll leave for you to see for yourself, defines the very nature of the prospect of freedom of speech, and more importantly, the most rudimentary of basic civil rights as we know them in the United States. Whether you like or hate Larry Flynt, Hustler Magazine, or pornography of any kind is irrelevant. What one must accept if they wish to abide by our constitution, is the inalienable right of every man and woman to be free individuals in terms of their opinions, expressions and thoughts. To do otherwise is a slap in the face to every person who has ever fought for the American way. "The People Vs. Larry Flynt" is a magnificent tale of not just one man's fight for the freedom of speech, but the entire thought process of how strongly we wish to continue to be a free country. Watch it, and be glad you're an American with rights.

    The life of Hustler publisher Larry Flynt has almost too much good material. It's one thing to grow up selling moonshine, buy up some strip clubs and launch one of the most explicit pornography magazines ever created. It's another to also be a one-time born-again Christian, bipolar painkiller addict and the unsuspecting bastion of First Amendment liberties. As such, watching "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is like watching at least three different movies: You have the rise of the boundary-pushing magazine editor, the drug-addled romance and the courtroom drama. So many events in Flynt's life and facets to his personality warrant a deeper look, yet there's just no time. Writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewksi and of course two-time Oscar-winning director Milos Foreman make the most of each part, but the whole product lacks the unity of a masterful biography. At the time, Woody Harrelson proved a curious choice to play Flynt, but he nails the bipolar aspects of the master pornographer. We have so much trouble determining his motives, digging for some sign of logical thought. In most cases, this makes for a frustrating case study, for which you might normally blame the actor for not taking us deep enough. Considering how the film jumps from one aspect of Flynt's life to the next in addition to how completely unpredictable of a character he is, Harrelson deserves praise. He keeps you on your toes like the crazy uncle who jokes so much you can't tell when he's really serious. Then there's Courtney Love. Playing Flynt's stripper girlfriend-turned-wife, Althea, Love gives Foreman more than he bargained for. Hiring a drug addict to play a drug addict is a dangerous game, and not when it comes to working with that person. It's tough to divorce love from Althea, such a controversial public figure at the time and even to some extent to this day. She's frighteningly real as Althea at some points, especially once she starts mooching off Flynt's painkillers after the assassination attempt. Some of the most compelling drama in the film comes in the courtroom scenes. Those fascinated to any extent with free speech law and censorship will crave more from "The People vs. Larry Flynt," especially when the title seems to promise it in higher doses. Edward Norton nabbed a career-making role as Flynt's attorney, Alan Isaacman. Getting noticed by Milos Foreman and Woody Allen ("Everyone Says I Love You") at the same time is pretty impressive. He delivers an expert closing argument in the film's first trial that will have you convinced he wins the case, as well as a powerful yet light-hearted opening speech in the Supreme Court's hearing of the infamous Flynt vs. Falwell case, a landmark win for First Amendment rights. "The People vs. Larry Flynt" touches on so many fascinating aspects of this enigmatic figure, but it sacrifices some depth and consequently the emotional pull. Flynt's life blurs by, and though the writing compensates with some nice transitions, there's no substitute for getting Q.T. with Flynt. The Hustler empire appears to be built in a day a scene in which Flynt tells a photographer that "a woman's vagina has as much personality as her face" is the most insight we get into his mind as editor. Good writing there, but a fleeting moment in the bigger picture. The second half of the film, essentially Larry's life after becoming a paraplegic, feels so radically different. Larry's stroke garbles his speech and Althea's addiction has her looking like a flying monkey in the "Wizard of Oz." Two people who once seemed to have their wits about them become such filthy and disturbed characters. At that point you start to identify with Norton's character instead, as he's the only one who understands the balance between defending free speech and making a complete mockery of the judicial system. You'll want this film to be more of everything, particularly of Flynt as the unorthodox crusader for free speech and the magazine publisher who works the line between genius and insanity. The individual moments or scenes of such captivate, but get lost on the whole. The challenge of boiling a fascinating man's life down to a series of striking moments can sometimes be too immense for even the best of filmmakers. ~Steven C Thanks for reading!

    "If the First Amendment will protect a scumbag like me, then it'll protect all of you -- 'cause I'm the worst," declares Hustler Magazine publisher Larry Flynt in the midst of one of his many court cases. The People vs. Larry Flynt is a biographical drama film directed by Milo Forman about the rise of pornographic magazine publisher and editor Larry Flynt, and his subsequent clash with the law. The film stars Woody Harrelson, Courtney Love, and Edward Norton.The film was written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. It spans about 25 years of Flynt's life from his impoverished upbringing in Kentucky to his court battle with Reverend Jerry Falwell, and is based in part on the U.S. Supreme Court case Hustler Magazine v. Falwell. Forman's film follows Flynt from his childhood in Kentucky, where he made extra money for his dirt-poor family by selling the moonshine his father brewed, into adulthood as he manages a strip club in Cincinnati. While the club does middling business, the experience changes Flynt's life in two ways: he meets Althea, an exotic dancer who becomes the love of his life, and he gets the bright idea of starting a magazine to promote the club. Marketed as a crasser, less pretentious alternative to Playboy or Penthouse, Hustler becomes a huge success after Flynt runs a photo series of Jacqueline Onassis sunbathing nude. However, while plenty of people are buying Hustler, there are also plenty of people who don't care for it, including Charles Keating, leader of a watchdog group called Citizens For Decent Literature. Keating spearheads the first of many legal attacks on the magazine, one of which reaches the Supreme Court as Alan Isaacman, Flynt's lawyer, debates the finer legal points of bad taste with the justices of the highest court in the land. Meanwhile, Flynt makes a fortune, loses the use of his legs after an attack by a sniper, embraces and than abandons Christianity, and eventually loses Althea, who succumbs to AIDS after a long addiction to drugs. A brave, spectacularly entertaining -- and unexpectedly stirring -- account of Flynt's life that asks us to regard the publisher of Hustler magazine as an invaluable champion of our First Amendment freedoms.It's a modern-day Capra film, about an unorthodox businessman who's persecuted for his originality but eventually is recognized for the lovable, rugged American individualist he truly is.Woody Harrelson plays Flynt with energy, and Courtney Love does at least as well as his wife.And special mention also goes to Edward Norton.The screenplay, by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, is rich in detail and dialogue.But still,the movie is not compelling enough to generate interest and great entertainment to the viewer.But still,it is a good movie to watch.

    A few years ago, I went to a DVD grocery store, eager to buy Tex Avery's collector DVD box, featuring all his hilarious MGM cartoons. Two cartoons were missing though and I found out they were banned because of racial stereotypes' portrayals on black people, and that they would never be put on DVD, or TV again, despite all the fans' protests and all the petitions: these cartoons were judged too offensive. No offense, but this is just bullshit, the only word to describe this is censorship: pure and simple. And in 2004, its reign of terror wasn't over yet  I'm evoking this anecdote just to highlight the sad reality that we still live in a world governed by a scandalous hypocrisy disguising censorship under the mask of political correctness. Lenny Bruce was censored because of his use of profanity and Larry Flynt for his pornographic images. Now that the Internet trivialized sex, the new taboo is communities. The 21st century is religious, racial, sectary and unfortunately, the fight featured in "The People vs. Larry Flynt" had only changed the field. The War is not over; the nonsense is still governing non-independent media, and we're still brainwashed  This is why "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is probably one of the most important films of the last two decades. It reveals the disastrous sickness that poisons America and Occidental counties in general: Political Correctness, the new dictatorship against every single principle that makes freedom of speech applicable. The message could be summarized in a simple point, in the case of absence of malice, one should make fun, mock, ridicule whatever people, institution, he or she desires. It's not up to the offender to anticipate the harm he will cause, it's up to the offended to accept the idea that whatever allowed one to talk against him, it will allow him to retort, in a satirical, serious or whatever tone he chooses to use. In one word: it's called tolerance. That's exactly why "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is not just a pamphlet written by Milos Forman using profanity, sex, lust, and nudity as so many punctuation marks. It's an inspirational message inviting us to question our approach to tolerance, and not in a preachy way. Larry Flynt is not a model, he's a dirty mind, but as he says, "he's the worst" and as the worst, he'll be the perfect thermometer to measure the acceptance of a country when it comes to the use of humor. But as I also stated in a previous review of Fosse's "Lenny", any simple form of thought is necessarily subversive. Any artistic creation offends a certain established order, otherwise, it's just creation but not Art. Larry Flynt offended, he broke a new taboo, but have we all forgotten that many today's standards were yesterday's taboos?! The philosophical value of "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is undeniable but I guess people were blinded by the profusion of nudity and lust at a point they didn't get how the film is incredibly brilliant in the demonstrations it tries to make ... sometimes in an explicitness I would have judged extreme if the course of the recent events hadn't proved how the point of the film was totally missed. Flynt paved the way to a certain philosophy of freedom that could allow many irreverent entertainers to undermine the image of sacred public, figures or institutions and even, for our delight, respectable cultural figures. But, there's more to that -something that'll make me venerate the film forever- it's the denunciation of an extreme contradiction that could threaten the application of freedom in a whole country: nothing is sacred enough not to be turned into derision. And if one thing shall be sacred, it's this principle. The title sets the mood of the film which is an endless fight through so many judiciary cases involving the 'good people' and Larry Flynt, another title could have been "Larry Flynt, Public Enemy N&deg;1" but this would have been wrong as Flynt had some fans interested on boobs, vagina, and fornication. And in a way, Flynt had done a great service to his country by desensitizing them about the dirtiness of sex. While many citizens were brainwashed to believe that Wars make heroes, in one of the most obscene masquerades that lead American to an humiliating defeat in Nam, Flynt unmasked the ugly face of American pride to reconcile it, with stuff that reaches a lower level ... only to prove there's no reason to feel guilty about loving harmless stuff just because good society says so. Especially when desensitization from violence can have even more devastating effects. And on a technical level, "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is certainly one of the most brilliant scripts ever written swinging between an outrageous and a thought-provoking tone until getting to its point, which is the inspirational denunciation of the hypocrisy governing our world. And freedom of laughing is indeed a way to fight taboos by their own weapons. I did not take Woody Harrelson seriously in the first notes of this brilliant symphony but how wrong I was, he was quite perfect in that role, and I can't go without mentioning Edward Norton as the struggling personal attorney Alan Isaacman, and to conclude Courtney Love in what I consider one of the greatest female performances ever, and I say it again, ONE OF THE GREATEST FEMALE PERFORMANCES EVER, I wonder how she didn't get and win an Oscar. Too trashy? Gimme a break, her devotion and sincere true love towards her husband made Larry's fight so endearing, she was the soul and heart of this film, while Norton was the brain. And Larry was the guts, that despite a tragic handicap was an inspiration to every citizen, to believe in his right to please his basic instincts ... it's basic principles.

    Say what you will about the subject matter of this film, it is very good. The People vs. Larry Flynt is about the creator of Hustler magazine, an extremely racy pornographic magazine that was way ahead of its time, and the legal battles that ensued upon its creation and development. It focuses on aspects of Flynt's home life as well as his business. His offensive magazine was condemned by onslaughts of disgusted American's, and this lead to Larry Flynt being a figurehead in the battle for free speech. The film tells a very interesting story with a colorful cast of odd characters, including the obscene and bizarre protagonist himself. The story that this film tells is not one that you will hear discussed in everyday society. It just isn't something that can easily be brought up, because of its raunchy subject matter. And that's why I enjoyed this movie so much, because it told a surprisingly fascinating story. There was a lot more to this legal battle than meets the eye. There was a surprising amount of aspects to the story that I wasn't expecting. The movie told a very interesting story about a very interesting man. The film covers a lot more ground than is to be expected. It begins with Larry and his brother running a small time strip club. Not long after the movie begins is Hustler created and Flynt begins to thrive. The main focus of the films conflict then starts to arise as Flynt is attacked by naysayers who are disgusted by what he is doing. From here a lot of things happen, some good, others not so good. There is plenty of comedy, drama, and even tragedy in this unorthodox story about a very unorthodox and yet fascinating man. I think I've made it clear that Larry Flynt was a fascinating character to watch unfold in this movie, but that doesn't mean he was a likable one. To put it lightly, Larry Flynt was a jerk in this film. He was vulgar, rude, and obscene. He objectified women and had little to no respect for authority. There were times where he became unbearably obnoxious in the film, but it all played in to what the character was all about. He undoubtedly developed issues as he grew older. He suffered one physical tragedy that left him impaired physically, but also drove his mind into depravity as well. But despite all this, I can't say I disrespect him for being so determined to exercise his first amendment rights. Considering the situation, you really can't argue with the points he makes in the film, whether you agree with him or not. The tagline of the film says it best. You might not like what he does, but are you prepared to give up his right to do it? This sums up what the legal battle the film focuses on is all about. He has the right to do what he does whether you like it or not. The film delivered very interesting battle of wits and morals. The film boasts a fascinating story with a variety of different characters, and it thankfully has the cast to hold up this aspect of the film. Woody Harrelson plays Larry Flynt, and he does an incredible job. Flynt goes through a lot of changes, both physical and mental, throughout the course of the film, and Harrelson conveys those changes extraordinarily well. It is definitely one of his finest leading roles. Courtney Love plays Flynt's wife, Althea. Now, I have absolutely no expect for Courtney Love. She is a disgusting and tasteless woman with no redeeming qualities except for her performance in The People vs. Larry Flynt. As much as I dislike Love, she does a fantastic job as Althea, a troubled and emotional character that isn't easy to access or understand the motives of because she is really just a nutjob. The character is very multi-dimensional, and Courtney Love does a surprising job at conveying it. Edward Norton plays Flynt's lawyer, Alan Isaacman. The character is another very interesting one. He shows how difficult it is to be the lawyer for a deranged man like Larry Flynt, but his will and determination give him an insightful and compelling edge that I really enjoyed. Plus I love Norton in everything he does, so loving him and his character was a no-brainer. I really loved this movie. It isn't perfect but what it delivers is excellent. The narrative has some issues. In the beginning of the film conflicts seem to arise and then just disappear without another word. There are some abrupt cuts that give the film an uneven feel and pacing. But by the end of the film these issues are easily forgivable because of how much I liked the overall story this film delivers. I really liked everything about this film and could easily see past some of its imperfections. The story is unique and interesting, and so are the characters that are portrayed by a great cast. Don't be turned off by this film's subject matter. You don't want to miss it.

    This is most certainly an interesting account of the life of Larry Flynt - the publisher of Hustler Magazine, perhaps the trashiest "mainstream" porn magazine ever published. Beginning with Flynt as a boy selling moonshine to his neighbours, the movie ends with Flynt triumphing over the Reverend Jerry Falwell in a case before the United States Supreme Court. What we see between these two events is disturbing, shocking and sometimes even funny. Flynt is anything but an attractive personality. Evolving from the owner of struggling strip club to a millionaire porn merchant, I suppose one has to respect the man for his ability to achieve his dreams and the triumph against the odds, but the "me against the world" persona wears thin after a while. Flynt comes across through most of this as self-absorbed. He claims to be fighting for the freedom of speech, but one really has the feeling that he's fighting for it not for the sake of anyone but himself. I didn't get the sense from this movie that Flynt had any sort of "greater good" at the forefront of his thoughts, although in fairness he has remained active in this area. There's an interesting look at his temporary conversion to Christianity, and his growing relationship with Ruth Carter Stapleton (Jimmy Carter's sister) who converted him to Christianity, which becomes quite humorous as he struggles within himself to reconcile his newfound faith with his work as a porn publisher. The movie also deals with his rejection of that faith and increasing bitterness after the shooting that left him paralyzed. There's great emphasis placed on his personal life and in particular with his wife Althea, who became a drug addict and an AIDS victim. (Interestingly, there's no reference to the fact that she was his fourth wife.) There are some great performances in this. Woody Harrelson offers a superb portrayal of Flynt (perhaps Harrelson's best acting) - sometimes in total control, other times totally out of control. Courtney Love was totally believable as Althea - devoted to Flynt but rapidly spiralling out of control herself. Edward Norton was fine as Flynt's long- suffering attorney Allan Isaacson. Flynt actually appears in this movie as the judge at his own first trial (at least the first one portrayed in the movie) in Cincinnati. Still, this is a difficult movie. It's fascinating for a while, but becomes a bit tiresome and repetitive after a while. Flynt repeats the same antics over and over again and after a while they lose their impact. The lead up to the court fight against Falwell - who sued him for libel for a satirical article in Hustler that accused him of incest - took up a lot of time, but it was hard to feel passion about it. Neither party is particularly attractive to me. Personally, I think Flynt's depiction of Falwell as a hypocrite was bang-on, but Flynt himself is just not a likable person, and it's hard to root for him against anyone - even Falwell. This is a good account of a life that would have to be described in many contradictory ways: a success story, but a very sad one. The guy who pushes the envelope beyond the breaking point but then objects when anyone pushes back. The guy who stands up for free speech and ends up front and centre in the midst of the battle, except that you kind of wish he wouldn't exercise it for himself. He's a strange guy.

    Movie about Larry Flynt--publisher of "Hustler" magazine. He's played by Woody Harrelson and it follows him from 1972 to the 1980s and deals with him defending his magazine against obscenity charges. It also details his wife Althea (Courtney Love) and their relationship. I've heard this movie was an idealized version of the true story but I knew nothing about Flynt before I saw this movie so I saw it with no preconceptions. It's episodic but compelling. Harrelson is GREAT in the title role. He does not turn Flynt into a saint--he's portrayed as obnoxious, controlling and a real jerk at times. However he does make it clear that "Hustler" should not be banned or considered obscene and he makes his case well. Most of it is through his lawyer Alan Isaacman (Edward Norton) who's very good in his role. But top acting honors go to Love who is just incredible as Althea. You see her character very convincingly age during the movie and you see her love and frustration with Flynt. Just a great performance which was totally ignored at the Academy Awards. Also it was great to see great character actors like Crispin Glover, Vincent Schiavelli and James Cromwell in small roles. It was well-directed by Milos Forman and shows the decades it takes place in very well. (There's fantastic use of the 1970s song "Dream Weaver") It's just a little bit overlong. The multiple court sequences get repetitious by hammering the same concepts to us again and again. Also it gets VERY depressing during it's last hour or so. Still, I found it fascinating and compelling. You may not like Flynt or his magazine but it makes a good case for admiring him for what he was fighting for. I give it an 8.

    Woody Harrelson delivers his best performance in director Milos Foreman's tragic true story, The people vs. Larry Flint. All of the actors give their best in this occasionally funny and sad true story. Woody Harrelson gives his best as Larry Flint, who starts the film off with owning a strip club with his brother. Then, Larry comes up with the idea for "Hustler" magazine,which i'm sure everyone has heard of. The film starts off sort of fun. But it takes a tragic turn when he is arrested. And after his arrest, his marriage to his stripper wife(Courtney Love, giving the most realistic and greatest performance of all) falls apart,and they try to find as many ways to arrest him as possible. I can't forget the performance by Edward Norton. Norton gives a lovable performance in everything he's in. Even if he's playing a bad guy he's lovable. And his performance here is both lovable and real. What a sad film. Really, it is. America destroyed Larry Flint. And it's tragic to watch cause the majority of the characters are so likable. And it's very sad to see all of their lives slowly fall apart throughout the years. The people vs. Larry Flint is a fantastic.It's funny,sad,powerful, and well acted. Courtney Love gives us the best performance in the film. Yes,better than Edward Norton. This is a forgotten classic that must be seen. The people vs. Larry Flint:4/4

    Milos Forman's biographic drama, though a little dragging and momentumless towards the middle, is a well-made movie, with incredible acting to steer it through. The movie misses the point, and tries to portray Mr.Larry Flynt as such a likable honest man. Larry Flynt, who had countless number of wives and divorces, whose ex-wives claim he was a beater, whose own daughter accused him of sexual abuse, who disowned his own daughter, whose magazines are a bit too sexist... is idealized a bit too much in the movie. But for what purpose? Why not show him the way he is? The whole point is to concentrate on the importance of the first amendment; no matter what kind of person it is, and what he/she is trying to express, the amendment gives them the freedom to do so. If the story was told from the neutral point of view of the lawyer (played by Edward Norton), with the magazines and the religious institutions on either side, it would have made a more compelling point. The acting is top-notch, and the only thin which holds the movie together. Woody Harrelson is a delight to watch, and Courtney Love is surprisingly good in her acting. Mr. Nortan does a charming supporting role.

    Courtney Love is the worst part of this movie. She's terrible, hard to stomach, and can't act to save her life. THAT SAID.... This is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and it really makes you think about what it means to live in the USA. For those of you out there reading this review who do not live in the USA, you've no doubt heard about how we Americans like to pride ourselves for being so freaking awesome... until someone points out how backwards and self-absorbed we really are. That's not to say Americans are bad (quite the contrary), but we definitely have a problem admitting when we're wrong. This movie makes no apologies, and goes straight for the jugular. And thanks to Milos Foreman, and Larry Flynt himself, this movie asks us to consider just how fundamental the right of free speech, and the freedom of expression, is to society. And yes, it relates to hardcore porn. Without delving too much into the technical aspects of the movie, let me just say that if you watch the Edward Norton courtroom scenes (the first where Larry Flynt himself is the judge, and the last one when he's arguing to the Supreme Court), and the epic speech our protagonist gives on "sex versus death," you are going to start developing opinions. It is going to make you think, and it might challenge your comfort zone. And for all those reasons, this movie is worth every moment of your time... including those painful scenes involving Courtney Love. I still think about this movie sometimes, whenever I hear people arguing about their First Amendment rights. Larry Flynt might not be a knight in shining armor, so to speak, but what he stands for is more than just porn - it's freedom of expression, and Americans have to accept that that doesn't necessarily mean something tame or conservative. It's an important lesson, and a movie that should not be missed.

    "The People Vs. Larry Flynt" is a film that might make you angry, or it may make you glad that we, as Americans, have the most cherished right any person could ask for: The freedom to voice an opinion or an idea, regardless of how unpopular or unappealing it may be. So it is with the true story of Larry Flynt, notorious publisher of the porn magazine "Hustler". It is essential to know that at no time does "People vs. Larry Flynt" try to depict it's title character as a saint, or a hero, or even someone you'd take to a family picnic. Flynt, by his own admission, acknowledges that he, and his magazine and it's content is the most provocative and blatant of it's kind in the field of pornographic material. But even more importantly is Flynt's assertion that if the First Amendment can protect someone like him, then it can protect each and every one of us who call ourselves Americans and our citizens' rights, for which countless men have fought and died to preserve. (Just for the record, I myself don't particularly care for pornographic material, but that's MY choice. I do not want nor will I abide any federal, state or local government invading MY life, telling me what I CAN or CANNOT partake of. If you want to talk about obscenity, I put it to you, dear reader, that the most obscene act a government can perform is to control the thoughts and words and ideas of it's own people. To do so is to hearken back to the days of Hitler, and other "thought police" who attempted to regulate free speech and independent thought. OK, rant over.) As to the film itself, the easiest way to describe it is that this is a top notch biographical story, filled with five star performances all around. Woody Harrelson, playing Flynt, does perhaps some of his greatest film work. Ed Norton, who plays Flynt's attorney, turns in yet another stellar job, and Courtney Love, who plays Flynt's wife, dazzles us by displaying, ironically enough, most of the same qualities that actually made her infamous in her own personal life. In the context of this film, however, those negatives of Love are exactly what was needed to recreate this character. The story, in a nutshell, southern Ohio club owner Larry Flynt gets the bright idea to base a magazine off of the type of entertainment he provides at his clubs. The magazine becomes a sensation, but also a perpetual target of moralistic crusaders who believe that material such as that produced by Flynt has no place anywhere in society; at least, in their eyes at any rate. And there is the conflict which drives this movie. Obscenity vs. Free Speech. Director Milos Forman gives us both sides of this argument throughout the film, but drives home the point that "American freedom" includes allowing others to voice opinions or present concepts that, while offensive and repulsive to some, are still just as worthy of protection as any other American's right to say what he or she feels. We follow Larry and his contemporaries through the rags to riches journey, and the ensuing attacks upon it by those who sternly disagree based on their own personal tastes. And "personal taste" is subjective, and therefore cannot be regulated to only one viewpoint. Late in the film, Flynt's case is brought before no less then the Supreme Court, stemming from an earlier court battle with evangelist Jerry Falwell. The ensuing decision from the High Court, which I'll leave for you to see for yourself, defines the very nature of the prospect of freedom of speech, and more importantly, the most rudimentary of basic civil rights as we know them in the United States. Whether you like or hate Larry Flynt, Hustler Magazine, or pornography of any kind is irrelevant. What one must accept if they wish to abide by our constitution, is the inalienable right of every man and woman to be free individuals in terms of their opinions, expressions and thoughts. To do otherwise is a slap in the face to every person who has ever fought for the American way. "The People Vs. Larry Flynt" is a magnificent tale of not just one man's fight for the freedom of speech, but the entire thought process of how strongly we wish to continue to be a free country. Watch it, and be glad you're an American with rights.

    The life of Hustler publisher Larry Flynt has almost too much good material. It's one thing to grow up selling moonshine, buy up some strip clubs and launch one of the most explicit pornography magazines ever created. It's another to also be a one-time born-again Christian, bipolar painkiller addict and the unsuspecting bastion of First Amendment liberties. As such, watching "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is like watching at least three different movies: You have the rise of the boundary-pushing magazine editor, the drug-addled romance and the courtroom drama. So many events in Flynt's life and facets to his personality warrant a deeper look, yet there's just no time. Writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewksi and of course two-time Oscar-winning director Milos Foreman make the most of each part, but the whole product lacks the unity of a masterful biography. At the time, Woody Harrelson proved a curious choice to play Flynt, but he nails the bipolar aspects of the master pornographer. We have so much trouble determining his motives, digging for some sign of logical thought. In most cases, this makes for a frustrating case study, for which you might normally blame the actor for not taking us deep enough. Considering how the film jumps from one aspect of Flynt's life to the next in addition to how completely unpredictable of a character he is, Harrelson deserves praise. He keeps you on your toes like the crazy uncle who jokes so much you can't tell when he's really serious. Then there's Courtney Love. Playing Flynt's stripper girlfriend-turned-wife, Althea, Love gives Foreman more than he bargained for. Hiring a drug addict to play a drug addict is a dangerous game, and not when it comes to working with that person. It's tough to divorce love from Althea, such a controversial public figure at the time and even to some extent to this day. She's frighteningly real as Althea at some points, especially once she starts mooching off Flynt's painkillers after the assassination attempt. Some of the most compelling drama in the film comes in the courtroom scenes. Those fascinated to any extent with free speech law and censorship will crave more from "The People vs. Larry Flynt," especially when the title seems to promise it in higher doses. Edward Norton nabbed a career-making role as Flynt's attorney, Alan Isaacman. Getting noticed by Milos Foreman and Woody Allen ("Everyone Says I Love You") at the same time is pretty impressive. He delivers an expert closing argument in the film's first trial that will have you convinced he wins the case, as well as a powerful yet light-hearted opening speech in the Supreme Court's hearing of the infamous Flynt vs. Falwell case, a landmark win for First Amendment rights. "The People vs. Larry Flynt" touches on so many fascinating aspects of this enigmatic figure, but it sacrifices some depth and consequently the emotional pull. Flynt's life blurs by, and though the writing compensates with some nice transitions, there's no substitute for getting Q.T. with Flynt. The Hustler empire appears to be built in a day a scene in which Flynt tells a photographer that "a woman's vagina has as much personality as her face" is the most insight we get into his mind as editor. Good writing there, but a fleeting moment in the bigger picture. The second half of the film, essentially Larry's life after becoming a paraplegic, feels so radically different. Larry's stroke garbles his speech and Althea's addiction has her looking like a flying monkey in the "Wizard of Oz." Two people who once seemed to have their wits about them become such filthy and disturbed characters. At that point you start to identify with Norton's character instead, as he's the only one who understands the balance between defending free speech and making a complete mockery of the judicial system. You'll want this film to be more of everything, particularly of Flynt as the unorthodox crusader for free speech and the magazine publisher who works the line between genius and insanity. The individual moments or scenes of such captivate, but get lost on the whole. The challenge of boiling a fascinating man's life down to a series of striking moments can sometimes be too immense for even the best of filmmakers. ~Steven C Thanks for reading!

    "If the First Amendment will protect a scumbag like me, then it'll protect all of you -- 'cause I'm the worst," declares Hustler Magazine publisher Larry Flynt in the midst of one of his many court cases. The People vs. Larry Flynt is a biographical drama film directed by Milo Forman about the rise of pornographic magazine publisher and editor Larry Flynt, and his subsequent clash with the law. The film stars Woody Harrelson, Courtney Love, and Edward Norton.The film was written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. It spans about 25 years of Flynt's life from his impoverished upbringing in Kentucky to his court battle with Reverend Jerry Falwell, and is based in part on the U.S. Supreme Court case Hustler Magazine v. Falwell. Forman's film follows Flynt from his childhood in Kentucky, where he made extra money for his dirt-poor family by selling the moonshine his father brewed, into adulthood as he manages a strip club in Cincinnati. While the club does middling business, the experience changes Flynt's life in two ways: he meets Althea, an exotic dancer who becomes the love of his life, and he gets the bright idea of starting a magazine to promote the club. Marketed as a crasser, less pretentious alternative to Playboy or Penthouse, Hustler becomes a huge success after Flynt runs a photo series of Jacqueline Onassis sunbathing nude. However, while plenty of people are buying Hustler, there are also plenty of people who don't care for it, including Charles Keating, leader of a watchdog group called Citizens For Decent Literature. Keating spearheads the first of many legal attacks on the magazine, one of which reaches the Supreme Court as Alan Isaacman, Flynt's lawyer, debates the finer legal points of bad taste with the justices of the highest court in the land. Meanwhile, Flynt makes a fortune, loses the use of his legs after an attack by a sniper, embraces and than abandons Christianity, and eventually loses Althea, who succumbs to AIDS after a long addiction to drugs. A brave, spectacularly entertaining -- and unexpectedly stirring -- account of Flynt's life that asks us to regard the publisher of Hustler magazine as an invaluable champion of our First Amendment freedoms.It's a modern-day Capra film, about an unorthodox businessman who's persecuted for his originality but eventually is recognized for the lovable, rugged American individualist he truly is.Woody Harrelson plays Flynt with energy, and Courtney Love does at least as well as his wife.And special mention also goes to Edward Norton.The screenplay, by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, is rich in detail and dialogue.But still,the movie is not compelling enough to generate interest and great entertainment to the viewer.But still,it is a good movie to watch.

    A few years ago, I went to a DVD grocery store, eager to buy Tex Avery's collector DVD box, featuring all his hilarious MGM cartoons. Two cartoons were missing though and I found out they were banned because of racial stereotypes' portrayals on black people, and that they would never be put on DVD, or TV again, despite all the fans' protests and all the petitions: these cartoons were judged too offensive. No offense, but this is just bullshit, the only word to describe this is censorship: pure and simple. And in 2004, its reign of terror wasn't over yet  I'm evoking this anecdote just to highlight the sad reality that we still live in a world governed by a scandalous hypocrisy disguising censorship under the mask of political correctness. Lenny Bruce was censored because of his use of profanity and Larry Flynt for his pornographic images. Now that the Internet trivialized sex, the new taboo is communities. The 21st century is religious, racial, sectary and unfortunately, the fight featured in "The People vs. Larry Flynt" had only changed the field. The War is not over; the nonsense is still governing non-independent media, and we're still brainwashed  This is why "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is probably one of the most important films of the last two decades. It reveals the disastrous sickness that poisons America and Occidental counties in general: Political Correctness, the new dictatorship against every single principle that makes freedom of speech applicable. The message could be summarized in a simple point, in the case of absence of malice, one should make fun, mock, ridicule whatever people, institution, he or she desires. It's not up to the offender to anticipate the harm he will cause, it's up to the offended to accept the idea that whatever allowed one to talk against him, it will allow him to retort, in a satirical, serious or whatever tone he chooses to use. In one word: it's called tolerance. That's exactly why "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is not just a pamphlet written by Milos Forman using profanity, sex, lust, and nudity as so many punctuation marks. It's an inspirational message inviting us to question our approach to tolerance, and not in a preachy way. Larry Flynt is not a model, he's a dirty mind, but as he says, "he's the worst" and as the worst, he'll be the perfect thermometer to measure the acceptance of a country when it comes to the use of humor. But as I also stated in a previous review of Fosse's "Lenny", any simple form of thought is necessarily subversive. Any artistic creation offends a certain established order, otherwise, it's just creation but not Art. Larry Flynt offended, he broke a new taboo, but have we all forgotten that many today's standards were yesterday's taboos?! The philosophical value of "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is undeniable but I guess people were blinded by the profusion of nudity and lust at a point they didn't get how the film is incredibly brilliant in the demonstrations it tries to make ... sometimes in an explicitness I would have judged extreme if the course of the recent events hadn't proved how the point of the film was totally missed. Flynt paved the way to a certain philosophy of freedom that could allow many irreverent entertainers to undermine the image of sacred public, figures or institutions and even, for our delight, respectable cultural figures. But, there's more to that -something that'll make me venerate the film forever- it's the denunciation of an extreme contradiction that could threaten the application of freedom in a whole country: nothing is sacred enough not to be turned into derision. And if one thing shall be sacred, it's this principle. The title sets the mood of the film which is an endless fight through so many judiciary cases involving the 'good people' and Larry Flynt, another title could have been "Larry Flynt, Public Enemy N&deg;1" but this would have been wrong as Flynt had some fans interested on boobs, vagina, and fornication. And in a way, Flynt had done a great service to his country by desensitizing them about the dirtiness of sex. While many citizens were brainwashed to believe that Wars make heroes, in one of the most obscene masquerades that lead American to an humiliating defeat in Nam, Flynt unmasked the ugly face of American pride to reconcile it, with stuff that reaches a lower level ... only to prove there's no reason to feel guilty about loving harmless stuff just because good society says so. Especially when desensitization from violence can have even more devastating effects. And on a technical level, "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is certainly one of the most brilliant scripts ever written swinging between an outrageous and a thought-provoking tone until getting to its point, which is the inspirational denunciation of the hypocrisy governing our world. And freedom of laughing is indeed a way to fight taboos by their own weapons. I did not take Woody Harrelson seriously in the first notes of this brilliant symphony but how wrong I was, he was quite perfect in that role, and I can't go without mentioning Edward Norton as the struggling personal attorney Alan Isaacman, and to conclude Courtney Love in what I consider one of the greatest female performances ever, and I say it again, ONE OF THE GREATEST FEMALE PERFORMANCES EVER, I wonder how she didn't get and win an Oscar. Too trashy? Gimme a break, her devotion and sincere true love towards her husband made Larry's fight so endearing, she was the soul and heart of this film, while Norton was the brain. And Larry was the guts, that despite a tragic handicap was an inspiration to every citizen, to believe in his right to please his basic instincts ... it's basic principles.

    Say what you will about the subject matter of this film, it is very good. The People vs. Larry Flynt is about the creator of Hustler magazine, an extremely racy pornographic magazine that was way ahead of its time, and the legal battles that ensued upon its creation and development. It focuses on aspects of Flynt's home life as well as his business. His offensive magazine was condemned by onslaughts of disgusted American's, and this lead to Larry Flynt being a figurehead in the battle for free speech. The film tells a very interesting story with a colorful cast of odd characters, including the obscene and bizarre protagonist himself. The story that this film tells is not one that you will hear discussed in everyday society. It just isn't something that can easily be brought up, because of its raunchy subject matter. And that's why I enjoyed this movie so much, because it told a surprisingly fascinating story. There was a lot more to this legal battle than meets the eye. There was a surprising amount of aspects to the story that I wasn't expecting. The movie told a very interesting story about a very interesting man. The film covers a lot more ground than is to be expected. It begins with Larry and his brother running a small time strip club. Not long after the movie begins is Hustler created and Flynt begins to thrive. The main focus of the films conflict then starts to arise as Flynt is attacked by naysayers who are disgusted by what he is doing. From here a lot of things happen, some good, others not so good. There is plenty of comedy, drama, and even tragedy in this unorthodox story about a very unorthodox and yet fascinating man. I think I've made it clear that Larry Flynt was a fascinating character to watch unfold in this movie, but that doesn't mean he was a likable one. To put it lightly, Larry Flynt was a jerk in this film. He was vulgar, rude, and obscene. He objectified women and had little to no respect for authority. There were times where he became unbearably obnoxious in the film, but it all played in to what the character was all about. He undoubtedly developed issues as he grew older. He suffered one physical tragedy that left him impaired physically, but also drove his mind into depravity as well. But despite all this, I can't say I disrespect him for being so determined to exercise his first amendment rights. Considering the situation, you really can't argue with the points he makes in the film, whether you agree with him or not. The tagline of the film says it best. You might not like what he does, but are you prepared to give up his right to do it? This sums up what the legal battle the film focuses on is all about. He has the right to do what he does whether you like it or not. The film delivered very interesting battle of wits and morals. The film boasts a fascinating story with a variety of different characters, and it thankfully has the cast to hold up this aspect of the film. Woody Harrelson plays Larry Flynt, and he does an incredible job. Flynt goes through a lot of changes, both physical and mental, throughout the course of the film, and Harrelson conveys those changes extraordinarily well. It is definitely one of his finest leading roles. Courtney Love plays Flynt's wife, Althea. Now, I have absolutely no expect for Courtney Love. She is a disgusting and tasteless woman with no redeeming qualities except for her performance in The People vs. Larry Flynt. As much as I dislike Love, she does a fantastic job as Althea, a troubled and emotional character that isn't easy to access or understand the motives of because she is really just a nutjob. The character is very multi-dimensional, and Courtney Love does a surprising job at conveying it. Edward Norton plays Flynt's lawyer, Alan Isaacman. The character is another very interesting one. He shows how difficult it is to be the lawyer for a deranged man like Larry Flynt, but his will and determination give him an insightful and compelling edge that I really enjoyed. Plus I love Norton in everything he does, so loving him and his character was a no-brainer. I really loved this movie. It isn't perfect but what it delivers is excellent. The narrative has some issues. In the beginning of the film conflicts seem to arise and then just disappear without another word. There are some abrupt cuts that give the film an uneven feel and pacing. But by the end of the film these issues are easily forgivable because of how much I liked the overall story this film delivers. I really liked everything about this film and could easily see past some of its imperfections. The story is unique and interesting, and so are the characters that are portrayed by a great cast. Don't be turned off by this film's subject matter. You don't want to miss it.

    This is most certainly an interesting account of the life of Larry Flynt - the publisher of Hustler Magazine, perhaps the trashiest "mainstream" porn magazine ever published. Beginning with Flynt as a boy selling moonshine to his neighbours, the movie ends with Flynt triumphing over the Reverend Jerry Falwell in a case before the United States Supreme Court. What we see between these two events is disturbing, shocking and sometimes even funny. Flynt is anything but an attractive personality. Evolving from the owner of struggling strip club to a millionaire porn merchant, I suppose one has to respect the man for his ability to achieve his dreams and the triumph against the odds, but the "me against the world" persona wears thin after a while. Flynt comes across through most of this as self-absorbed. He claims to be fighting for the freedom of speech, but one really has the feeling that he's fighting for it not for the sake of anyone but himself. I didn't get the sense from this movie that Flynt had any sort of "greater good" at the forefront of his thoughts, although in fairness he has remained active in this area. There's an interesting look at his temporary conversion to Christianity, and his growing relationship with Ruth Carter Stapleton (Jimmy Carter's sister) who converted him to Christianity, which becomes quite humorous as he struggles within himself to reconcile his newfound faith with his work as a porn publisher. The movie also deals with his rejection of that faith and increasing bitterness after the shooting that left him paralyzed. There's great emphasis placed on his personal life and in particular with his wife Althea, who became a drug addict and an AIDS victim. (Interestingly, there's no reference to the fact that she was his fourth wife.) There are some great performances in this. Woody Harrelson offers a superb portrayal of Flynt (perhaps Harrelson's best acting) - sometimes in total control, other times totally out of control. Courtney Love was totally believable as Althea - devoted to Flynt but rapidly spiralling out of control herself. Edward Norton was fine as Flynt's long- suffering attorney Allan Isaacson. Flynt actually appears in this movie as the judge at his own first trial (at least the first one portrayed in the movie) in Cincinnati. Still, this is a difficult movie. It's fascinating for a while, but becomes a bit tiresome and repetitive after a while. Flynt repeats the same antics over and over again and after a while they lose their impact. The lead up to the court fight against Falwell - who sued him for libel for a satirical article in Hustler that accused him of incest - took up a lot of time, but it was hard to feel passion about it. Neither party is particularly attractive to me. Personally, I think Flynt's depiction of Falwell as a hypocrite was bang-on, but Flynt himself is just not a likable person, and it's hard to root for him against anyone - even Falwell. This is a good account of a life that would have to be described in many contradictory ways: a success story, but a very sad one. The guy who pushes the envelope beyond the breaking point but then objects when anyone pushes back. The guy who stands up for free speech and ends up front and centre in the midst of the battle, except that you kind of wish he wouldn't exercise it for himself. He's a strange guy.

    Movie about Larry Flynt--publisher of "Hustler" magazine. He's played by Woody Harrelson and it follows him from 1972 to the 1980s and deals with him defending his magazine against obscenity charges. It also details his wife Althea (Courtney Love) and their relationship. I've heard this movie was an idealized version of the true story but I knew nothing about Flynt before I saw this movie so I saw it with no preconceptions. It's episodic but compelling. Harrelson is GREAT in the title role. He does not turn Flynt into a saint--he's portrayed as obnoxious, controlling and a real jerk at times. However he does make it clear that "Hustler" should not be banned or considered obscene and he makes his case well. Most of it is through his lawyer Alan Isaacman (Edward Norton) who's very good in his role. But top acting honors go to Love who is just incredible as Althea. You see her character very convincingly age during the movie and you see her love and frustration with Flynt. Just a great performance which was totally ignored at the Academy Awards. Also it was great to see great character actors like Crispin Glover, Vincent Schiavelli and James Cromwell in small roles. It was well-directed by Milos Forman and shows the decades it takes place in very well. (There's fantastic use of the 1970s song "Dream Weaver") It's just a little bit overlong. The multiple court sequences get repetitious by hammering the same concepts to us again and again. Also it gets VERY depressing during it's last hour or so. Still, I found it fascinating and compelling. You may not like Flynt or his magazine but it makes a good case for admiring him for what he was fighting for. I give it an 8.

    Woody Harrelson delivers his best performance in director Milos Foreman's tragic true story, The people vs. Larry Flint. All of the actors give their best in this occasionally funny and sad true story. Woody Harrelson gives his best as Larry Flint, who starts the film off with owning a strip club with his brother. Then, Larry comes up with the idea for "Hustler" magazine,which i'm sure everyone has heard of. The film starts off sort of fun. But it takes a tragic turn when he is arrested. And after his arrest, his marriage to his stripper wife(Courtney Love, giving the most realistic and greatest performance of all) falls apart,and they try to find as many ways to arrest him as possible. I can't forget the performance by Edward Norton. Norton gives a lovable performance in everything he's in. Even if he's playing a bad guy he's lovable. And his performance here is both lovable and real. What a sad film. Really, it is. America destroyed Larry Flint. And it's tragic to watch cause the majority of the characters are so likable. And it's very sad to see all of their lives slowly fall apart throughout the years. The people vs. Larry Flint is a fantastic.It's funny,sad,powerful, and well acted. Courtney Love gives us the best performance in the film. Yes,better than Edward Norton. This is a forgotten classic that must be seen. The people vs. Larry Flint:4/4

    Milos Forman's biographic drama, though a little dragging and momentumless towards the middle, is a well-made movie, with incredible acting to steer it through. The movie misses the point, and tries to portray Mr.Larry Flynt as such a likable honest man. Larry Flynt, who had countless number of wives and divorces, whose ex-wives claim he was a beater, whose own daughter accused him of sexual abuse, who disowned his own daughter, whose magazines are a bit too sexist... is idealized a bit too much in the movie. But for what purpose? Why not show him the way he is? The whole point is to concentrate on the importance of the first amendment; no matter what kind of person it is, and what he/she is trying to express, the amendment gives them the freedom to do so. If the story was told from the neutral point of view of the lawyer (played by Edward Norton), with the magazines and the religious institutions on either side, it would have made a more compelling point. The acting is top-notch, and the only thin which holds the movie together. Woody Harrelson is a delight to watch, and Courtney Love is surprisingly good in her acting. Mr. Nortan does a charming supporting role.

    Courtney Love is the worst part of this movie. She's terrible, hard to stomach, and can't act to save her life. THAT SAID.... This is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and it really makes you think about what it means to live in the USA. For those of you out there reading this review who do not live in the USA, you've no doubt heard about how we Americans like to pride ourselves for being so freaking awesome... until someone points out how backwards and self-absorbed we really are. That's not to say Americans are bad (quite the contrary), but we definitely have a problem admitting when we're wrong. This movie makes no apologies, and goes straight for the jugular. And thanks to Milos Foreman, and Larry Flynt himself, this movie asks us to consider just how fundamental the right of free speech, and the freedom of expression, is to society. And yes, it relates to hardcore porn. Without delving too much into the technical aspects of the movie, let me just say that if you watch the Edward Norton courtroom scenes (the first where Larry Flynt himself is the judge, and the last one when he's arguing to the Supreme Court), and the epic speech our protagonist gives on "sex versus death," you are going to start developing opinions. It is going to make you think, and it might challenge your comfort zone. And for all those reasons, this movie is worth every moment of your time... including those painful scenes involving Courtney Love. I still think about this movie sometimes, whenever I hear people arguing about their First Amendment rights. Larry Flynt might not be a knight in shining armor, so to speak, but what he stands for is more than just porn - it's freedom of expression, and Americans have to accept that that doesn't necessarily mean something tame or conservative. It's an important lesson, and a movie that should not be missed.

    "The People Vs. Larry Flynt" is a film that might make you angry, or it may make you glad that we, as Americans, have the most cherished right any person could ask for: The freedom to voice an opinion or an idea, regardless of how unpopular or unappealing it may be. So it is with the true story of Larry Flynt, notorious publisher of the porn magazine "Hustler". It is essential to know that at no time does "People vs. Larry Flynt" try to depict it's title character as a saint, or a hero, or even someone you'd take to a family picnic. Flynt, by his own admission, acknowledges that he, and his magazine and it's content is the most provocative and blatant of it's kind in the field of pornographic material. But even more importantly is Flynt's assertion that if the First Amendment can protect someone like him, then it can protect each and every one of us who call ourselves Americans and our citizens' rights, for which countless men have fought and died to preserve. (Just for the record, I myself don't particularly care for pornographic material, but that's MY choice. I do not want nor will I abide any federal, state or local government invading MY life, telling me what I CAN or CANNOT partake of. If you want to talk about obscenity, I put it to you, dear reader, that the most obscene act a government can perform is to control the thoughts and words and ideas of it's own people. To do so is to hearken back to the days of Hitler, and other "thought police" who attempted to regulate free speech and independent thought. OK, rant over.) As to the film itself, the easiest way to describe it is that this is a top notch biographical story, filled with five star performances all around. Woody Harrelson, playing Flynt, does perhaps some of his greatest film work. Ed Norton, who plays Flynt's attorney, turns in yet another stellar job, and Courtney Love, who plays Flynt's wife, dazzles us by displaying, ironically enough, most of the same qualities that actually made her infamous in her own personal life. In the context of this film, however, those negatives of Love are exactly what was needed to recreate this character. The story, in a nutshell, southern Ohio club owner Larry Flynt gets the bright idea to base a magazine off of the type of entertainment he provides at his clubs. The magazine becomes a sensation, but also a perpetual target of moralistic crusaders who believe that material such as that produced by Flynt has no place anywhere in society; at least, in their eyes at any rate. And there is the conflict which drives this movie. Obscenity vs. Free Speech. Director Milos Forman gives us both sides of this argument throughout the film, but drives home the point that "American freedom" includes allowing others to voice opinions or present concepts that, while offensive and repulsive to some, are still just as worthy of protection as any other American's right to say what he or she feels. We follow Larry and his contemporaries through the rags to riches journey, and the ensuing attacks upon it by those who sternly disagree based on their own personal tastes. And "personal taste" is subjective, and therefore cannot be regulated to only one viewpoint. Late in the film, Flynt's case is brought before no less then the Supreme Court, stemming from an earlier court battle with evangelist Jerry Falwell. The ensuing decision from the High Court, which I'll leave for you to see for yourself, defines the very nature of the prospect of freedom of speech, and more importantly, the most rudimentary of basic civil rights as we know them in the United States. Whether you like or hate Larry Flynt, Hustler Magazine, or pornography of any kind is irrelevant. What one must accept if they wish to abide by our constitution, is the inalienable right of every man and woman to be free individuals in terms of their opinions, expressions and thoughts. To do otherwise is a slap in the face to every person who has ever fought for the American way. "The People Vs. Larry Flynt" is a magnificent tale of not just one man's fight for the freedom of speech, but the entire thought process of how strongly we wish to continue to be a free country. Watch it, and be glad you're an American with rights.

    The life of Hustler publisher Larry Flynt has almost too much good material. It's one thing to grow up selling moonshine, buy up some strip clubs and launch one of the most explicit pornography magazines ever created. It's another to also be a one-time born-again Christian, bipolar painkiller addict and the unsuspecting bastion of First Amendment liberties. As such, watching "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is like watching at least three different movies: You have the rise of the boundary-pushing magazine editor, the drug-addled romance and the courtroom drama. So many events in Flynt's life and facets to his personality warrant a deeper look, yet there's just no time. Writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewksi and of course two-time Oscar-winning director Milos Foreman make the most of each part, but the whole product lacks the unity of a masterful biography. At the time, Woody Harrelson proved a curious choice to play Flynt, but he nails the bipolar aspects of the master pornographer. We have so much trouble determining his motives, digging for some sign of logical thought. In most cases, this makes for a frustrating case study, for which you might normally blame the actor for not taking us deep enough. Considering how the film jumps from one aspect of Flynt's life to the next in addition to how completely unpredictable of a character he is, Harrelson deserves praise. He keeps you on your toes like the crazy uncle who jokes so much you can't tell when he's really serious. Then there's Courtney Love. Playing Flynt's stripper girlfriend-turned-wife, Althea, Love gives Foreman more than he bargained for. Hiring a drug addict to play a drug addict is a dangerous game, and not when it comes to working with that person. It's tough to divorce love from Althea, such a controversial public figure at the time and even to some extent to this day. She's frighteningly real as Althea at some points, especially once she starts mooching off Flynt's painkillers after the assassination attempt. Some of the most compelling drama in the film comes in the courtroom scenes. Those fascinated to any extent with free speech law and censorship will crave more from "The People vs. Larry Flynt," especially when the title seems to promise it in higher doses. Edward Norton nabbed a career-making role as Flynt's attorney, Alan Isaacman. Getting noticed by Milos Foreman and Woody Allen ("Everyone Says I Love You") at the same time is pretty impressive. He delivers an expert closing argument in the film's first trial that will have you convinced he wins the case, as well as a powerful yet light-hearted opening speech in the Supreme Court's hearing of the infamous Flynt vs. Falwell case, a landmark win for First Amendment rights. "The People vs. Larry Flynt" touches on so many fascinating aspects of this enigmatic figure, but it sacrifices some depth and consequently the emotional pull. Flynt's life blurs by, and though the writing compensates with some nice transitions, there's no substitute for getting Q.T. with Flynt. The Hustler empire appears to be built in a day a scene in which Flynt tells a photographer that "a woman's vagina has as much personality as her face" is the most insight we get into his mind as editor. Good writing there, but a fleeting moment in the bigger picture. The second half of the film, essentially Larry's life after becoming a paraplegic, feels so radically different. Larry's stroke garbles his speech and Althea's addiction has her looking like a flying monkey in the "Wizard of Oz." Two people who once seemed to have their wits about them become such filthy and disturbed characters. At that point you start to identify with Norton's character instead, as he's the only one who understands the balance between defending free speech and making a complete mockery of the judicial system. You'll want this film to be more of everything, particularly of Flynt as the unorthodox crusader for free speech and the magazine publisher who works the line between genius and insanity. The individual moments or scenes of such captivate, but get lost on the whole. The challenge of boiling a fascinating man's life down to a series of striking moments can sometimes be too immense for even the best of filmmakers. ~Steven C Thanks for reading!

    "If the First Amendment will protect a scumbag like me, then it'll protect all of you -- 'cause I'm the worst," declares Hustler Magazine publisher Larry Flynt in the midst of one of his many court cases. The People vs. Larry Flynt is a biographical drama film directed by Milo Forman about the rise of pornographic magazine publisher and editor Larry Flynt, and his subsequent clash with the law. The film stars Woody Harrelson, Courtney Love, and Edward Norton.The film was written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. It spans about 25 years of Flynt's life from his impoverished upbringing in Kentucky to his court battle with Reverend Jerry Falwell, and is based in part on the U.S. Supreme Court case Hustler Magazine v. Falwell. Forman's film follows Flynt from his childhood in Kentucky, where he made extra money for his dirt-poor family by selling the moonshine his father brewed, into adulthood as he manages a strip club in Cincinnati. While the club does middling business, the experience changes Flynt's life in two ways: he meets Althea, an exotic dancer who becomes the love of his life, and he gets the bright idea of starting a magazine to promote the club. Marketed as a crasser, less pretentious alternative to Playboy or Penthouse, Hustler becomes a huge success after Flynt runs a photo series of Jacqueline Onassis sunbathing nude. However, while plenty of people are buying Hustler, there are also plenty of people who don't care for it, including Charles Keating, leader of a watchdog group called Citizens For Decent Literature. Keating spearheads the first of many legal attacks on the magazine, one of which reaches the Supreme Court as Alan Isaacman, Flynt's lawyer, debates the finer legal points of bad taste with the justices of the highest court in the land. Meanwhile, Flynt makes a fortune, loses the use of his legs after an attack by a sniper, embraces and than abandons Christianity, and eventually loses Althea, who succumbs to AIDS after a long addiction to drugs. A brave, spectacularly entertaining -- and unexpectedly stirring -- account of Flynt's life that asks us to regard the publisher of Hustler magazine as an invaluable champion of our First Amendment freedoms.It's a modern-day Capra film, about an unorthodox businessman who's persecuted for his originality but eventually is recognized for the lovable, rugged American individualist he truly is.Woody Harrelson plays Flynt with energy, and Courtney Love does at least as well as his wife.And special mention also goes to Edward Norton.The screenplay, by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, is rich in detail and dialogue.But still,the movie is not compelling enough to generate interest and great entertainment to the viewer.But still,it is a good movie to watch.

    A few years ago, I went to a DVD grocery store, eager to buy Tex Avery's collector DVD box, featuring all his hilarious MGM cartoons. Two cartoons were missing though and I found out they were banned because of racial stereotypes' portrayals on black people, and that they would never be put on DVD, or TV again, despite all the fans' protests and all the petitions: these cartoons were judged too offensive. No offense, but this is just bullshit, the only word to describe this is censorship: pure and simple. And in 2004, its reign of terror wasn't over yet  I'm evoking this anecdote just to highlight the sad reality that we still live in a world governed by a scandalous hypocrisy disguising censorship under the mask of political correctness. Lenny Bruce was censored because of his use of profanity and Larry Flynt for his pornographic images. Now that the Internet trivialized sex, the new taboo is communities. The 21st century is religious, racial, sectary and unfortunately, the fight featured in "The People vs. Larry Flynt" had only changed the field. The War is not over; the nonsense is still governing non-independent media, and we're still brainwashed  This is why "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is probably one of the most important films of the last two decades. It reveals the disastrous sickness that poisons America and Occidental counties in general: Political Correctness, the new dictatorship against every single principle that makes freedom of speech applicable. The message could be summarized in a simple point, in the case of absence of malice, one should make fun, mock, ridicule whatever people, institution, he or she desires. It's not up to the offender to anticipate the harm he will cause, it's up to the offended to accept the idea that whatever allowed one to talk against him, it will allow him to retort, in a satirical, serious or whatever tone he chooses to use. In one word: it's called tolerance. That's exactly why "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is not just a pamphlet written by Milos Forman using profanity, sex, lust, and nudity as so many punctuation marks. It's an inspirational message inviting us to question our approach to tolerance, and not in a preachy way. Larry Flynt is not a model, he's a dirty mind, but as he says, "he's the worst" and as the worst, he'll be the perfect thermometer to measure the acceptance of a country when it comes to the use of humor. But as I also stated in a previous review of Fosse's "Lenny", any simple form of thought is necessarily subversive. Any artistic creation offends a certain established order, otherwise, it's just creation but not Art. Larry Flynt offended, he broke a new taboo, but have we all forgotten that many today's standards were yesterday's taboos?! The philosophical value of "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is undeniable but I guess people were blinded by the profusion of nudity and lust at a point they didn't get how the film is incredibly brilliant in the demonstrations it tries to make ... sometimes in an explicitness I would have judged extreme if the course of the recent events hadn't proved how the point of the film was totally missed. Flynt paved the way to a certain philosophy of freedom that could allow many irreverent entertainers to undermine the image of sacred public, figures or institutions and even, for our delight, respectable cultural figures. But, there's more to that -something that'll make me venerate the film forever- it's the denunciation of an extreme contradiction that could threaten the application of freedom in a whole country: nothing is sacred enough not to be turned into derision. And if one thing shall be sacred, it's this principle. The title sets the mood of the film which is an endless fight through so many judiciary cases involving the 'good people' and Larry Flynt, another title could have been "Larry Flynt, Public Enemy N&deg;1" but this would have been wrong as Flynt had some fans interested on boobs, vagina, and fornication. And in a way, Flynt had done a great service to his country by desensitizing them about the dirtiness of sex. While many citizens were brainwashed to believe that Wars make heroes, in one of the most obscene masquerades that lead American to an humiliating defeat in Nam, Flynt unmasked the ugly face of American pride to reconcile it, with stuff that reaches a lower level ... only to prove there's no reason to feel guilty about loving harmless stuff just because good society says so. Especially when desensitization from violence can have even more devastating effects. And on a technical level, "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is certainly one of the most brilliant scripts ever written swinging between an outrageous and a thought-provoking tone until getting to its point, which is the inspirational denunciation of the hypocrisy governing our world. And freedom of laughing is indeed a way to fight taboos by their own weapons. I did not take Woody Harrelson seriously in the first notes of this brilliant symphony but how wrong I was, he was quite perfect in that role, and I can't go without mentioning Edward Norton as the struggling personal attorney Alan Isaacman, and to conclude Courtney Love in what I consider one of the greatest female performances ever, and I say it again, ONE OF THE GREATEST FEMALE PERFORMANCES EVER, I wonder how she didn't get and win an Oscar. Too trashy? Gimme a break, her devotion and sincere true love towards her husband made Larry's fight so endearing, she was the soul and heart of this film, while Norton was the brain. And Larry was the guts, that despite a tragic handicap was an inspiration to every citizen, to believe in his right to please his basic instincts ... it's basic principles.

    Say what you will about the subject matter of this film, it is very good. The People vs. Larry Flynt is about the creator of Hustler magazine, an extremely racy pornographic magazine that was way ahead of its time, and the legal battles that ensued upon its creation and development. It focuses on aspects of Flynt's home life as well as his business. His offensive magazine was condemned by onslaughts of disgusted American's, and this lead to Larry Flynt being a figurehead in the battle for free speech. The film tells a very interesting story with a colorful cast of odd characters, including the obscene and bizarre protagonist himself. The story that this film tells is not one that you will hear discussed in everyday society. It just isn't something that can easily be brought up, because of its raunchy subject matter. And that's why I enjoyed this movie so much, because it told a surprisingly fascinating story. There was a lot more to this legal battle than meets the eye. There was a surprising amount of aspects to the story that I wasn't expecting. The movie told a very interesting story about a very interesting man. The film covers a lot more ground than is to be expected. It begins with Larry and his brother running a small time strip club. Not long after the movie begins is Hustler created and Flynt begins to thrive. The main focus of the films conflict then starts to arise as Flynt is attacked by naysayers who are disgusted by what he is doing. From here a lot of things happen, some good, others not so good. There is plenty of comedy, drama, and even tragedy in this unorthodox story about a very unorthodox and yet fascinating man. I think I've made it clear that Larry Flynt was a fascinating character to watch unfold in this movie, but that doesn't mean he was a likable one. To put it lightly, Larry Flynt was a jerk in this film. He was vulgar, rude, and obscene. He objectified women and had little to no respect for authority. There were times where he became unbearably obnoxious in the film, but it all played in to what the character was all about. He undoubtedly developed issues as he grew older. He suffered one physical tragedy that left him impaired physically, but also drove his mind into depravity as well. But despite all this, I can't say I disrespect him for being so determined to exercise his first amendment rights. Considering the situation, you really can't argue with the points he makes in the film, whether you agree with him or not. The tagline of the film says it best. You might not like what he does, but are you prepared to give up his right to do it? This sums up what the legal battle the film focuses on is all about. He has the right to do what he does whether you like it or not. The film delivered very interesting battle of wits and morals. The film boasts a fascinating story with a variety of different characters, and it thankfully has the cast to hold up this aspect of the film. Woody Harrelson plays Larry Flynt, and he does an incredible job. Flynt goes through a lot of changes, both physical and mental, throughout the course of the film, and Harrelson conveys those changes extraordinarily well. It is definitely one of his finest leading roles. Courtney Love plays Flynt's wife, Althea. Now, I have absolutely no expect for Courtney Love. She is a disgusting and tasteless woman with no redeeming qualities except for her performance in The People vs. Larry Flynt. As much as I dislike Love, she does a fantastic job as Althea, a troubled and emotional character that isn't easy to access or understand the motives of because she is really just a nutjob. The character is very multi-dimensional, and Courtney Love does a surprising job at conveying it. Edward Norton plays Flynt's lawyer, Alan Isaacman. The character is another very interesting one. He shows how difficult it is to be the lawyer for a deranged man like Larry Flynt, but his will and determination give him an insightful and compelling edge that I really enjoyed. Plus I love Norton in everything he does, so loving him and his character was a no-brainer. I really loved this movie. It isn't perfect but what it delivers is excellent. The narrative has some issues. In the beginning of the film conflicts seem to arise and then just disappear without another word. There are some abrupt cuts that give the film an uneven feel and pacing. But by the end of the film these issues are easily forgivable because of how much I liked the overall story this film delivers. I really liked everything about this film and could easily see past some of its imperfections. The story is unique and interesting, and so are the characters that are portrayed by a great cast. Don't be turned off by this film's subject matter. You don't want to miss it.

    This is most certainly an interesting account of the life of Larry Flynt - the publisher of Hustler Magazine, perhaps the trashiest "mainstream" porn magazine ever published. Beginning with Flynt as a boy selling moonshine to his neighbours, the movie ends with Flynt triumphing over the Reverend Jerry Falwell in a case before the United States Supreme Court. What we see between these two events is disturbing, shocking and sometimes even funny. Flynt is anything but an attractive personality. Evolving from the owner of struggling strip club to a millionaire porn merchant, I suppose one has to respect the man for his ability to achieve his dreams and the triumph against the odds, but the "me against the world" persona wears thin after a while. Flynt comes across through most of this as self-absorbed. He claims to be fighting for the freedom of speech, but one really has the feeling that he's fighting for it not for the sake of anyone but himself. I didn't get the sense from this movie that Flynt had any sort of "greater good" at the forefront of his thoughts, although in fairness he has remained active in this area. There's an interesting look at his temporary conversion to Christianity, and his growing relationship with Ruth Carter Stapleton (Jimmy Carter's sister) who converted him to Christianity, which becomes quite humorous as he struggles within himself to reconcile his newfound faith with his work as a porn publisher. The movie also deals with his rejection of that faith and increasing bitterness after the shooting that left him paralyzed. There's great emphasis placed on his personal life and in particular with his wife Althea, who became a drug addict and an AIDS victim. (Interestingly, there's no reference to the fact that she was his fourth wife.) There are some great performances in this. Woody Harrelson offers a superb portrayal of Flynt (perhaps Harrelson's best acting) - sometimes in total control, other times totally out of control. Courtney Love was totally believable as Althea - devoted to Flynt but rapidly spiralling out of control herself. Edward Norton was fine as Flynt's long- suffering attorney Allan Isaacson. Flynt actually appears in this movie as the judge at his own first trial (at least the first one portrayed in the movie) in Cincinnati. Still, this is a difficult movie. It's fascinating for a while, but becomes a bit tiresome and repetitive after a while. Flynt repeats the same antics over and over again and after a while they lose their impact. The lead up to the court fight against Falwell - who sued him for libel for a satirical article in Hustler that accused him of incest - took up a lot of time, but it was hard to feel passion about it. Neither party is particularly attractive to me. Personally, I think Flynt's depiction of Falwell as a hypocrite was bang-on, but Flynt himself is just not a likable person, and it's hard to root for him against anyone - even Falwell. This is a good account of a life that would have to be described in many contradictory ways: a success story, but a very sad one. The guy who pushes the envelope beyond the breaking point but then objects when anyone pushes back. The guy who stands up for free speech and ends up front and centre in the midst of the battle, except that you kind of wish he wouldn't exercise it for himself. He's a strange guy.

    Movie about Larry Flynt--publisher of "Hustler" magazine. He's played by Woody Harrelson and it follows him from 1972 to the 1980s and deals with him defending his magazine against obscenity charges. It also details his wife Althea (Courtney Love) and their relationship. I've heard this movie was an idealized version of the true story but I knew nothing about Flynt before I saw this movie so I saw it with no preconceptions. It's episodic but compelling. Harrelson is GREAT in the title role. He does not turn Flynt into a saint--he's portrayed as obnoxious, controlling and a real jerk at times. However he does make it clear that "Hustler" should not be banned or considered obscene and he makes his case well. Most of it is through his lawyer Alan Isaacman (Edward Norton) who's very good in his role. But top acting honors go to Love who is just incredible as Althea. You see her character very convincingly age during the movie and you see her love and frustration with Flynt. Just a great performance which was totally ignored at the Academy Awards. Also it was great to see great character actors like Crispin Glover, Vincent Schiavelli and James Cromwell in small roles. It was well-directed by Milos Forman and shows the decades it takes place in very well. (There's fantastic use of the 1970s song "Dream Weaver") It's just a little bit overlong. The multiple court sequences get repetitious by hammering the same concepts to us again and again. Also it gets VERY depressing during it's last hour or so. Still, I found it fascinating and compelling. You may not like Flynt or his magazine but it makes a good case for admiring him for what he was fighting for. I give it an 8.

    Woody Harrelson delivers his best performance in director Milos Foreman's tragic true story, The people vs. Larry Flint. All of the actors give their best in this occasionally funny and sad true story. Woody Harrelson gives his best as Larry Flint, who starts the film off with owning a strip club with his brother. Then, Larry comes up with the idea for "Hustler" magazine,which i'm sure everyone has heard of. The film starts off sort of fun. But it takes a tragic turn when he is arrested. And after his arrest, his marriage to his stripper wife(Courtney Love, giving the most realistic and greatest performance of all) falls apart,and they try to find as many ways to arrest him as possible. I can't forget the performance by Edward Norton. Norton gives a lovable performance in everything he's in. Even if he's playing a bad guy he's lovable. And his performance here is both lovable and real. What a sad film. Really, it is. America destroyed Larry Flint. And it's tragic to watch cause the majority of the characters are so likable. And it's very sad to see all of their lives slowly fall apart throughout the years. The people vs. Larry Flint is a fantastic.It's funny,sad,powerful, and well acted. Courtney Love gives us the best performance in the film. Yes,better than Edward Norton. This is a forgotten classic that must be seen. The people vs. Larry Flint:4/4

    Milos Forman's biographic drama, though a little dragging and momentumless towards the middle, is a well-made movie, with incredible acting to steer it through. The movie misses the point, and tries to portray Mr.Larry Flynt as such a likable honest man. Larry Flynt, who had countless number of wives and divorces, whose ex-wives claim he was a beater, whose own daughter accused him of sexual abuse, who disowned his own daughter, whose magazines are a bit too sexist... is idealized a bit too much in the movie. But for what purpose? Why not show him the way he is? The whole point is to concentrate on the importance of the first amendment; no matter what kind of person it is, and what he/she is trying to express, the amendment gives them the freedom to do so. If the story was told from the neutral point of view of the lawyer (played by Edward Norton), with the magazines and the religious institutions on either side, it would have made a more compelling point. The acting is top-notch, and the only thin which holds the movie together. Woody Harrelson is a delight to watch, and Courtney Love is surprisingly good in her acting. Mr. Nortan does a charming supporting role.

    Courtney Love is the worst part of this movie. She's terrible, hard to stomach, and can't act to save her life. THAT SAID.... This is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and it really makes you think about what it means to live in the USA. For those of you out there reading this review who do not live in the USA, you've no doubt heard about how we Americans like to pride ourselves for being so freaking awesome... until someone points out how backwards and self-absorbed we really are. That's not to say Americans are bad (quite the contrary), but we definitely have a problem admitting when we're wrong. This movie makes no apologies, and goes straight for the jugular. And thanks to Milos Foreman, and Larry Flynt himself, this movie asks us to consider just how fundamental the right of free speech, and the freedom of expression, is to society. And yes, it relates to hardcore porn. Without delving too much into the technical aspects of the movie, let me just say that if you watch the Edward Norton courtroom scenes (the first where Larry Flynt himself is the judge, and the last one when he's arguing to the Supreme Court), and the epic speech our protagonist gives on "sex versus death," you are going to start developing opinions. It is going to make you think, and it might challenge your comfort zone. And for all those reasons, this movie is worth every moment of your time... including those painful scenes involving Courtney Love. I still think about this movie sometimes, whenever I hear people arguing about their First Amendment rights. Larry Flynt might not be a knight in shining armor, so to speak, but what he stands for is more than just porn - it's freedom of expression, and Americans have to accept that that doesn't necessarily mean something tame or conservative. It's an important lesson, and a movie that should not be missed.

    "The People Vs. Larry Flynt" is a film that might make you angry, or it may make you glad that we, as Americans, have the most cherished right any person could ask for: The freedom to voice an opinion or an idea, regardless of how unpopular or unappealing it may be. So it is with the true story of Larry Flynt, notorious publisher of the porn magazine "Hustler". It is essential to know that at no time does "People vs. Larry Flynt" try to depict it's title character as a saint, or a hero, or even someone you'd take to a family picnic. Flynt, by his own admission, acknowledges that he, and his magazine and it's content is the most provocative and blatant of it's kind in the field of pornographic material. But even more importantly is Flynt's assertion that if the First Amendment can protect someone like him, then it can protect each and every one of us who call ourselves Americans and our citizens' rights, for which countless men have fought and died to preserve. (Just for the record, I myself don't particularly care for pornographic material, but that's MY choice. I do not want nor will I abide any federal, state or local government invading MY life, telling me what I CAN or CANNOT partake of. If you want to talk about obscenity, I put it to you, dear reader, that the most obscene act a government can perform is to control the thoughts and words and ideas of it's own people. To do so is to hearken back to the days of Hitler, and other "thought police" who attempted to regulate free speech and independent thought. OK, rant over.) As to the film itself, the easiest way to describe it is that this is a top notch biographical story, filled with five star performances all around. Woody Harrelson, playing Flynt, does perhaps some of his greatest film work. Ed Norton, who plays Flynt's attorney, turns in yet another stellar job, and Courtney Love, who plays Flynt's wife, dazzles us by displaying, ironically enough, most of the same qualities that actually made her infamous in her own personal life. In the context of this film, however, those negatives of Love are exactly what was needed to recreate this character. The story, in a nutshell, southern Ohio club owner Larry Flynt gets the bright idea to base a magazine off of the type of entertainment he provides at his clubs. The magazine becomes a sensation, but also a perpetual target of moralistic crusaders who believe that material such as that produced by Flynt has no place anywhere in society; at least, in their eyes at any rate. And there is the conflict which drives this movie. Obscenity vs. Free Speech. Director Milos Forman gives us both sides of this argument throughout the film, but drives home the point that "American freedom" includes allowing others to voice opinions or present concepts that, while offensive and repulsive to some, are still just as worthy of protection as any other American's right to say what he or she feels. We follow Larry and his contemporaries through the rags to riches journey, and the ensuing attacks upon it by those who sternly disagree based on their own personal tastes. And "personal taste" is subjective, and therefore cannot be regulated to only one viewpoint. Late in the film, Flynt's case is brought before no less then the Supreme Court, stemming from an earlier court battle with evangelist Jerry Falwell. The ensuing decision from the High Court, which I'll leave for you to see for yourself, defines the very nature of the prospect of freedom of speech, and more importantly, the most rudimentary of basic civil rights as we know them in the United States. Whether you like or hate Larry Flynt, Hustler Magazine, or pornography of any kind is irrelevant. What one must accept if they wish to abide by our constitution, is the inalienable right of every man and woman to be free individuals in terms of their opinions, expressions and thoughts. To do otherwise is a slap in the face to every person who has ever fought for the American way. "The People Vs. Larry Flynt" is a magnificent tale of not just one man's fight for the freedom of speech, but the entire thought process of how strongly we wish to continue to be a free country. Watch it, and be glad you're an American with rights.

    The life of Hustler publisher Larry Flynt has almost too much good material. It's one thing to grow up selling moonshine, buy up some strip clubs and launch one of the most explicit pornography magazines ever created. It's another to also be a one-time born-again Christian, bipolar painkiller addict and the unsuspecting bastion of First Amendment liberties. As such, watching "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is like watching at least three different movies: You have the rise of the boundary-pushing magazine editor, the drug-addled romance and the courtroom drama. So many events in Flynt's life and facets to his personality warrant a deeper look, yet there's just no time. Writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewksi and of course two-time Oscar-winning director Milos Foreman make the most of each part, but the whole product lacks the unity of a masterful biography. At the time, Woody Harrelson proved a curious choice to play Flynt, but he nails the bipolar aspects of the master pornographer. We have so much trouble determining his motives, digging for some sign of logical thought. In most cases, this makes for a frustrating case study, for which you might normally blame the actor for not taking us deep enough. Considering how the film jumps from one aspect of Flynt's life to the next in addition to how completely unpredictable of a character he is, Harrelson deserves praise. He keeps you on your toes like the crazy uncle who jokes so much you can't tell when he's really serious. Then there's Courtney Love. Playing Flynt's stripper girlfriend-turned-wife, Althea, Love gives Foreman more than he bargained for. Hiring a drug addict to play a drug addict is a dangerous game, and not when it comes to working with that person. It's tough to divorce love from Althea, such a controversial public figure at the time and even to some extent to this day. She's frighteningly real as Althea at some points, especially once she starts mooching off Flynt's painkillers after the assassination attempt. Some of the most compelling drama in the film comes in the courtroom scenes. Those fascinated to any extent with free speech law and censorship will crave more from "The People vs. Larry Flynt," especially when the title seems to promise it in higher doses. Edward Norton nabbed a career-making role as Flynt's attorney, Alan Isaacman. Getting noticed by Milos Foreman and Woody Allen ("Everyone Says I Love You") at the same time is pretty impressive. He delivers an expert closing argument in the film's first trial that will have you convinced he wins the case, as well as a powerful yet light-hearted opening speech in the Supreme Court's hearing of the infamous Flynt vs. Falwell case, a landmark win for First Amendment rights. "The People vs. Larry Flynt" touches on so many fascinating aspects of this enigmatic figure, but it sacrifices some depth and consequently the emotional pull. Flynt's life blurs by, and though the writing compensates with some nice transitions, there's no substitute for getting Q.T. with Flynt. The Hustler empire appears to be built in a day a scene in which Flynt tells a photographer that "a woman's vagina has as much personality as her face" is the most insight we get into his mind as editor. Good writing there, but a fleeting moment in the bigger picture. The second half of the film, essentially Larry's life after becoming a paraplegic, feels so radically different. Larry's stroke garbles his speech and Althea's addiction has her looking like a flying monkey in the "Wizard of Oz." Two people who once seemed to have their wits about them become such filthy and disturbed characters. At that point you start to identify with Norton's character instead, as he's the only one who understands the balance between defending free speech and making a complete mockery of the judicial system. You'll want this film to be more of everything, particularly of Flynt as the unorthodox crusader for free speech and the magazine publisher who works the line between genius and insanity. The individual moments or scenes of such captivate, but get lost on the whole. The challenge of boiling a fascinating man's life down to a series of striking moments can sometimes be too immense for even the best of filmmakers. ~Steven C Thanks for reading!

    "If the First Amendment will protect a scumbag like me, then it'll protect all of you -- 'cause I'm the worst," declares Hustler Magazine publisher Larry Flynt in the midst of one of his many court cases. The People vs. Larry Flynt is a biographical drama film directed by Milo Forman about the rise of pornographic magazine publisher and editor Larry Flynt, and his subsequent clash with the law. The film stars Woody Harrelson, Courtney Love, and Edward Norton.The film was written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. It spans about 25 years of Flynt's life from his impoverished upbringing in Kentucky to his court battle with Reverend Jerry Falwell, and is based in part on the U.S. Supreme Court case Hustler Magazine v. Falwell. Forman's film follows Flynt from his childhood in Kentucky, where he made extra money for his dirt-poor family by selling the moonshine his father brewed, into adulthood as he manages a strip club in Cincinnati. While the club does middling business, the experience changes Flynt's life in two ways: he meets Althea, an exotic dancer who becomes the love of his life, and he gets the bright idea of starting a magazine to promote the club. Marketed as a crasser, less pretentious alternative to Playboy or Penthouse, Hustler becomes a huge success after Flynt runs a photo series of Jacqueline Onassis sunbathing nude. However, while plenty of people are buying Hustler, there are also plenty of people who don't care for it, including Charles Keating, leader of a watchdog group called Citizens For Decent Literature. Keating spearheads the first of many legal attacks on the magazine, one of which reaches the Supreme Court as Alan Isaacman, Flynt's lawyer, debates the finer legal points of bad taste with the justices of the highest court in the land. Meanwhile, Flynt makes a fortune, loses the use of his legs after an attack by a sniper, embraces and than abandons Christianity, and eventually loses Althea, who succumbs to AIDS after a long addiction to drugs. A brave, spectacularly entertaining -- and unexpectedly stirring -- account of Flynt's life that asks us to regard the publisher of Hustler magazine as an invaluable champion of our First Amendment freedoms.It's a modern-day Capra film, about an unorthodox businessman who's persecuted for his originality but eventually is recognized for the lovable, rugged American individualist he truly is.Woody Harrelson plays Flynt with energy, and Courtney Love does at least as well as his wife.And special mention also goes to Edward Norton.The screenplay, by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, is rich in detail and dialogue.But still,the movie is not compelling enough to generate interest and great entertainment to the viewer.But still,it is a good movie to watch.

    A few years ago, I went to a DVD grocery store, eager to buy Tex Avery's collector DVD box, featuring all his hilarious MGM cartoons. Two cartoons were missing though and I found out they were banned because of racial stereotypes' portrayals on black people, and that they would never be put on DVD, or TV again, despite all the fans' protests and all the petitions: these cartoons were judged too offensive. No offense, but this is just bullshit, the only word to describe this is censorship: pure and simple. And in 2004, its reign of terror wasn't over yet  I'm evoking this anecdote just to highlight the sad reality that we still live in a world governed by a scandalous hypocrisy disguising censorship under the mask of political correctness. Lenny Bruce was censored because of his use of profanity and Larry Flynt for his pornographic images. Now that the Internet trivialized sex, the new taboo is communities. The 21st century is religious, racial, sectary and unfortunately, the fight featured in "The People vs. Larry Flynt" had only changed the field. The War is not over; the nonsense is still governing non-independent media, and we're still brainwashed  This is why "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is probably one of the most important films of the last two decades. It reveals the disastrous sickness that poisons America and Occidental counties in general: Political Correctness, the new dictatorship against every single principle that makes freedom of speech applicable. The message could be summarized in a simple point, in the case of absence of malice, one should make fun, mock, ridicule whatever people, institution, he or she desires. It's not up to the offender to anticipate the harm he will cause, it's up to the offended to accept the idea that whatever allowed one to talk against him, it will allow him to retort, in a satirical, serious or whatever tone he chooses to use. In one word: it's called tolerance. That's exactly why "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is not just a pamphlet written by Milos Forman using profanity, sex, lust, and nudity as so many punctuation marks. It's an inspirational message inviting us to question our approach to tolerance, and not in a preachy way. Larry Flynt is not a model, he's a dirty mind, but as he says, "he's the worst" and as the worst, he'll be the perfect thermometer to measure the acceptance of a country when it comes to the use of humor. But as I also stated in a previous review of Fosse's "Lenny", any simple form of thought is necessarily subversive. Any artistic creation offends a certain established order, otherwise, it's just creation but not Art. Larry Flynt offended, he broke a new taboo, but have we all forgotten that many today's standards were yesterday's taboos?! The philosophical value of "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is undeniable but I guess people were blinded by the profusion of nudity and lust at a point they didn't get how the film is incredibly brilliant in the demonstrations it tries to make ... sometimes in an explicitness I would have judged extreme if the course of the recent events hadn't proved how the point of the film was totally missed. Flynt paved the way to a certain philosophy of freedom that could allow many irreverent entertainers to undermine the image of sacred public, figures or institutions and even, for our delight, respectable cultural figures. But, there's more to that -something that'll make me venerate the film forever- it's the denunciation of an extreme contradiction that could threaten the application of freedom in a whole country: nothing is sacred enough not to be turned into derision. And if one thing shall be sacred, it's this principle. The title sets the mood of the film which is an endless fight through so many judiciary cases involving the 'good people' and Larry Flynt, another title could have been "Larry Flynt, Public Enemy N&deg;1" but this would have been wrong as Flynt had some fans interested on boobs, vagina, and fornication. And in a way, Flynt had done a great service to his country by desensitizing them about the dirtiness of sex. While many citizens were brainwashed to believe that Wars make heroes, in one of the most obscene masquerades that lead American to an humiliating defeat in Nam, Flynt unmasked the ugly face of American pride to reconcile it, with stuff that reaches a lower level ... only to prove there's no reason to feel guilty about loving harmless stuff just because good society says so. Especially when desensitization from violence can have even more devastating effects. And on a technical level, "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is certainly one of the most brilliant scripts ever written swinging between an outrageous and a thought-provoking tone until getting to its point, which is the inspirational denunciation of the hypocrisy governing our world. And freedom of laughing is indeed a way to fight taboos by their own weapons. I did not take Woody Harrelson seriously in the first notes of this brilliant symphony but how wrong I was, he was quite perfect in that role, and I can't go without mentioning Edward Norton as the struggling personal attorney Alan Isaacman, and to conclude Courtney Love in what I consider one of the greatest female performances ever, and I say it again, ONE OF THE GREATEST FEMALE PERFORMANCES EVER, I wonder how she didn't get and win an Oscar. Too trashy? Gimme a break, her devotion and sincere true love towards her husband made Larry's fight so endearing, she was the soul and heart of this film, while Norton was the brain. And Larry was the guts, that despite a tragic handicap was an inspiration to every citizen, to believe in his right to please his basic instincts ... it's basic principles.

    Say what you will about the subject matter of this film, it is very good. The People vs. Larry Flynt is about the creator of Hustler magazine, an extremely racy pornographic magazine that was way ahead of its time, and the legal battles that ensued upon its creation and development. It focuses on aspects of Flynt's home life as well as his business. His offensive magazine was condemned by onslaughts of disgusted American's, and this lead to Larry Flynt being a figurehead in the battle for free speech. The film tells a very interesting story with a colorful cast of odd characters, including the obscene and bizarre protagonist himself. The story that this film tells is not one that you will hear discussed in everyday society. It just isn't something that can easily be brought up, because of its raunchy subject matter. And that's why I enjoyed this movie so much, because it told a surprisingly fascinating story. There was a lot more to this legal battle than meets the eye. There was a surprising amount of aspects to the story that I wasn't expecting. The movie told a very interesting story about a very interesting man. The film covers a lot more ground than is to be expected. It begins with Larry and his brother running a small time strip club. Not long after the movie begins is Hustler created and Flynt begins to thrive. The main focus of the films conflict then starts to arise as Flynt is attacked by naysayers who are disgusted by what he is doing. From here a lot of things happen, some good, others not so good. There is plenty of comedy, drama, and even tragedy in this unorthodox story about a very unorthodox and yet fascinating man. I think I've made it clear that Larry Flynt was a fascinating character to watch unfold in this movie, but that doesn't mean he was a likable one. To put it lightly, Larry Flynt was a jerk in this film. He was vulgar, rude, and obscene. He objectified women and had little to no respect for authority. There were times where he became unbearably obnoxious in the film, but it all played in to what the character was all about. He undoubtedly developed issues as he grew older. He suffered one physical tragedy that left him impaired physically, but also drove his mind into depravity as well. But despite all this, I can't say I disrespect him for being so determined to exercise his first amendment rights. Considering the situation, you really can't argue with the points he makes in the film, whether you agree with him or not. The tagline of the film says it best. You might not like what he does, but are you prepared to give up his right to do it? This sums up what the legal battle the film focuses on is all about. He has the right to do what he does whether you like it or not. The film delivered very interesting battle of wits and morals. The film boasts a fascinating story with a variety of different characters, and it thankfully has the cast to hold up this aspect of the film. Woody Harrelson plays Larry Flynt, and he does an incredible job. Flynt goes through a lot of changes, both physical and mental, throughout the course of the film, and Harrelson conveys those changes extraordinarily well. It is definitely one of his finest leading roles. Courtney Love plays Flynt's wife, Althea. Now, I have absolutely no expect for Courtney Love. She is a disgusting and tasteless woman with no redeeming qualities except for her performance in The People vs. Larry Flynt. As much as I dislike Love, she does a fantastic job as Althea, a troubled and emotional character that isn't easy to access or understand the motives of because she is really just a nutjob. The character is very multi-dimensional, and Courtney Love does a surprising job at conveying it. Edward Norton plays Flynt's lawyer, Alan Isaacman. The character is another very interesting one. He shows how difficult it is to be the lawyer for a deranged man like Larry Flynt, but his will and determination give him an insightful and compelling edge that I really enjoyed. Plus I love Norton in everything he does, so loving him and his character was a no-brainer. I really loved this movie. It isn't perfect but what it delivers is excellent. The narrative has some issues. In the beginning of the film conflicts seem to arise and then just disappear without another word. There are some abrupt cuts that give the film an uneven feel and pacing. But by the end of the film these issues are easily forgivable because of how much I liked the overall story this film delivers. I really liked everything about this film and could easily see past some of its imperfections. The story is unique and interesting, and so are the characters that are portrayed by a great cast. Don't be turned off by this film's subject matter. You don't want to miss it.

    This is most certainly an interesting account of the life of Larry Flynt - the publisher of Hustler Magazine, perhaps the trashiest "mainstream" porn magazine ever published. Beginning with Flynt as a boy selling moonshine to his neighbours, the movie ends with Flynt triumphing over the Reverend Jerry Falwell in a case before the United States Supreme Court. What we see between these two events is disturbing, shocking and sometimes even funny. Flynt is anything but an attractive personality. Evolving from the owner of struggling strip club to a millionaire porn merchant, I suppose one has to respect the man for his ability to achieve his dreams and the triumph against the odds, but the "me against the world" persona wears thin after a while. Flynt comes across through most of this as self-absorbed. He claims to be fighting for the freedom of speech, but one really has the feeling that he's fighting for it not for the sake of anyone but himself. I didn't get the sense from this movie that Flynt had any sort of "greater good" at the forefront of his thoughts, although in fairness he has remained active in this area. There's an interesting look at his temporary conversion to Christianity, and his growing relationship with Ruth Carter Stapleton (Jimmy Carter's sister) who converted him to Christianity, which becomes quite humorous as he struggles within himself to reconcile his newfound faith with his work as a porn publisher. The movie also deals with his rejection of that faith and increasing bitterness after the shooting that left him paralyzed. There's great emphasis placed on his personal life and in particular with his wife Althea, who became a drug addict and an AIDS victim. (Interestingly, there's no reference to the fact that she was his fourth wife.) There are some great performances in this. Woody Harrelson offers a superb portrayal of Flynt (perhaps Harrelson's best acting) - sometimes in total control, other times totally out of control. Courtney Love was totally believable as Althea - devoted to Flynt but rapidly spiralling out of control herself. Edward Norton was fine as Flynt's long- suffering attorney Allan Isaacson. Flynt actually appears in this movie as the judge at his own first trial (at least the first one portrayed in the movie) in Cincinnati. Still, this is a difficult movie. It's fascinating for a while, but becomes a bit tiresome and repetitive after a while. Flynt repeats the same antics over and over again and after a while they lose their impact. The lead up to the court fight against Falwell - who sued him for libel for a satirical article in Hustler that accused him of incest - took up a lot of time, but it was hard to feel passion about it. Neither party is particularly attractive to me. Personally, I think Flynt's depiction of Falwell as a hypocrite was bang-on, but Flynt himself is just not a likable person, and it's hard to root for him against anyone - even Falwell. This is a good account of a life that would have to be described in many contradictory ways: a success story, but a very sad one. The guy who pushes the envelope beyond the breaking point but then objects when anyone pushes back. The guy who stands up for free speech and ends up front and centre in the midst of the battle, except that you kind of wish he wouldn't exercise it for himself. He's a strange guy.

    Movie about Larry Flynt--publisher of "Hustler" magazine. He's played by Woody Harrelson and it follows him from 1972 to the 1980s and deals with him defending his magazine against obscenity charges. It also details his wife Althea (Courtney Love) and their relationship. I've heard this movie was an idealized version of the true story but I knew nothing about Flynt before I saw this movie so I saw it with no preconceptions. It's episodic but compelling. Harrelson is GREAT in the title role. He does not turn Flynt into a saint--he's portrayed as obnoxious, controlling and a real jerk at times. However he does make it clear that "Hustler" should not be banned or considered obscene and he makes his case well. Most of it is through his lawyer Alan Isaacman (Edward Norton) who's very good in his role. But top acting honors go to Love who is just incredible as Althea. You see her character very convincingly age during the movie and you see her love and frustration with Flynt. Just a great performance which was totally ignored at the Academy Awards. Also it was great to see great character actors like Crispin Glover, Vincent Schiavelli and James Cromwell in small roles. It was well-directed by Milos Forman and shows the decades it takes place in very well. (There's fantastic use of the 1970s song "Dream Weaver") It's just a little bit overlong. The multiple court sequences get repetitious by hammering the same concepts to us again and again. Also it gets VERY depressing during it's last hour or so. Still, I found it fascinating and compelling. You may not like Flynt or his magazine but it makes a good case for admiring him for what he was fighting for. I give it an 8.

    Woody Harrelson delivers his best performance in director Milos Foreman's tragic true story, The people vs. Larry Flint. All of the actors give their best in this occasionally funny and sad true story. Woody Harrelson gives his best as Larry Flint, who starts the film off with owning a strip club with his brother. Then, Larry comes up with the idea for "Hustler" magazine,which i'm sure everyone has heard of. The film starts off sort of fun. But it takes a tragic turn when he is arrested. And after his arrest, his marriage to his stripper wife(Courtney Love, giving the most realistic and greatest performance of all) falls apart,and they try to find as many ways to arrest him as possible. I can't forget the performance by Edward Norton. Norton gives a lovable performance in everything he's in. Even if he's playing a bad guy he's lovable. And his performance here is both lovable and real. What a sad film. Really, it is. America destroyed Larry Flint. And it's tragic to watch cause the majority of the characters are so likable. And it's very sad to see all of their lives slowly fall apart throughout the years. The people vs. Larry Flint is a fantastic.It's funny,sad,powerful, and well acted. Courtney Love gives us the best performance in the film. Yes,better than Edward Norton. This is a forgotten classic that must be seen. The people vs. Larry Flint:4/4
