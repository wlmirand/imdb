 <sinopse>
  Dr. Ellie Arroway, after years of searching, finds conclusive radio proof of intelligent aliens, who send plans for a mysterious machine.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Astronomer Dr. Ellie Arroway has long been interested in contact to faraway lands, a love fostered in her childhood by her father, Ted Arroway, who passed away when she was nine years old leaving her then orphaned. Her current work in monitoring for extraterrestrial life is based on that love and is in part an homage to her father. Ever since funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF) was pulled on her work, which is referred to some, including her NSF superior David Drumlin, as more science fiction than science, Ellie, with a few of her rogue scientist colleagues, have looked for funding from where ever they could get it to continue their work. When Ellie and her colleagues hear chatter originating from the vicinity of the star Vega, Ellie feels vindicated. But that vindication is short lived when others, including politicians, the military, religious leaders and other scientists such as Drumlin, try to take over her work. When the messages received from space are decoded, ...

    Contact is an incredible movie that touches upon the intricate subject of both science and religion as well as their somewhat opposing values and beliefs. This notion is clearly depicted in the form of human relationship, particularly speaking, the relationship between Eleanor Arroway and Palmor Joss, a scientist and a priest. Their contrasting beliefs and ideologies together with their shared love for each other shows not only the difference between science and religion but also their similarities. Both Jodie Foster and Matthew McConaughey did a brilliant job at playing their roles. Overall, it was a delightful experience to watch a fictional story of the event of alien contact. One complaint though, on my part, is that most of the antagonistic elements of the movie such as Drumlin or Kitz, are all depicted as ignorant and arrogant power figures that do nothing more than annoy and constrain the main character, which seems quite stupid in all honesty. In a global effort to make contact with an alien civilization, would such people really go as far as take advantage of an honest and talented scientist, whose discovery has literally altered the course of history, simply for the reason of personal gain? All Drumlin did was finish Arroway's sentences and steal her glory while pretending to be innocent. Same goes for Kitz, all he did was criticize when everything seemed like it went to toilet. These details might seem minor but I feel like they were a bit exaggerated really. But they are what they are, only minor annoyances, doesn't in any way affect the great story. 7.5/10 would watch again.

    I'm kind of sciencefiction fanatic but for some reason Contact never attracted me. But after hearing some OK stories I decided to view it after all this time it was released. Beforehand I knew it was about mankind making contact with an alien source and the whole builtup to that happening was executed very good. The whole deciphering part of the signal felt a bit like an Indiana Jones adventure. Very smart writing. What I didn't like at all was that I felt the director was trying to please both the church goers and scientists. I got no clue at all why a huge chunk of the story was reserved for a science vs religion debate. What was the point? And to please the atheists/scientist a fundamental Christian terrorist was thrown in. Like he wanted to say "hey you can't blame me that I must be sponsored by the church! I wrote a Christian terrorist in the story!" It all felt really misplaced for me. Like a scene from a different movie. They could have written out the whole Matthew McConaughey part and it would be a better movie. His role was just stupid. For a scifi geek the whole building of the wormhole-portal machine was just great. And it got even better when the whole travelling part began. After watching the intro of the movie where we saw the planet Earth zooming out to our Galaxy, then clusters and then the whole Universe I was hoping that something would happen again and it did. With wormhole travelling. It really felt like a roller-coaster ride. The actual arrival on the alien planet felt a bit disappointing. The alien who dressed up as her dad was lame. Maybe it was original then but I just wanted to see the imagination of what an alien lifeform would look like according to the director. So that was disappointing. So if the story would be all about Jody Fosters ambition without the pointless religion crap and the love affair with Matthew McConaughey I would have given it an 8 probably. Now a 6 but still a good watch.

    This movie pretends to be intelligent but is not. It is full of plot and factual holes. There are too numerous so I will just address the most glaring ones. First, the most glaring 'factual' hole: the 'first public TV broadcast of 1936 cannot possibly have reached Vega and responded to by the time-frame the movie is set: as of now the signal has barely entered the outer-limits of the solar system!!! Now the most glaring plot hole that seems to have so far escaped any mention: the machine in Hokkaido is NOT one time use only machine--why didn't anybody after the Jody Foster character get on the machine and verify what she said was indeed what actually happened? Was the damage to the chair assembly (caused by the character's getting off to retrieve the necklace)too severe to be repaired???? Come on, it does not make sense.

    I remember I saw this movie when I was little and I liked it a lot. However, now I was convinced the reason I had liked it so much was the excitement and curiosity it had stirred in me while watching it, and I didn't expect it to be so meaningful as I discovered it to be when re- watching it now, after approx. 12 years since I saw it. This movie is building up on existential questions we all have asked ourselves at one point or another in our lives: Are we alone in this Universe? Is there a God? What is the purpose of our life? etc). As the movie progresses, the feeling of getting closer to answering those questions is getting stronger and stronger, until it reaches it's climax: the part where you'll find yourself just observing, full of curiosity and excitement. The ending has its own unique way of answering those questions. Given the fact that it tackles such controversial, hard, essential questions and problems, one would expect this movie to collapse in an annoying unsatisfying feeling at the end. Well, it doesn't. This movie is a true work of art. Brilliant!

    Carl Sagan is a hero of mine. I admit it. Him and Richard Feynman. If more people had them as role-models instead of sports-stars, actors and models the world would look a very different place, to the better. Sagan never took opposition to religion, he merely asked: if there is a creator, who created him? In this masterpiece he again leans towards that question with religion being portrayed by Matt M and science by Jodie Foster. Of course science is the main focus and i remember Sagan in his TV- series "Cosmos" often contemplating how a Non-Terrestial-Intelligence would contact us and that his conclusion was by mathematics, in this case prime numbers. This movie is great and has a message that speaks to many people: Have an open mind and be curious about the world and cosmos we live in, and that we are not alone in this universe. This movie is a lost gem in many ways, people these days just needs their quick-fix action-flick. That's sad.

    From the mind of astronomer Carl Sagan, and flawlessly directed by Robert Zemeckis, "Contact" tells the story of a young astronomer/scientist named Ellie Arroway, played to perfection by Jodie Foster, who discovers a message from outer space that may finally be proof of intelligent life in the universe. The message is mathematical in nature, but basically details blueprints for a vehicle intended to bring its occupant to the star Vega, from where the message is originating. Director Zemeckis is in familiar waters here, blending fiction seamlessly with reality; such as actual footage from press conferences with former president Bill Clinton, as well as cameos by a host of news personalities, all playing themselves. What Zemeckis started in "Forrest Gump" is refined and improved in "Contact", an unfairly underrated and under-appreciated parable about science, religion and the great gulf that separates them. In addition to Jodie Foster's superlative work, more outstanding performances from stars such as James Woods, Tom Skerritt and Matthew McConaughey round out a truly stellar cast, pun definitely intended. In the course of the story, the argument of "god" vs. science is brought up consistently, but Zemeckis wisely refrains from taking a side here, instead allowing the viewer to make their own decision on which "truth" is the real one. (On a personal note: I, myself, would be classified as a "non-believer" HOWEVER, I also subscribe to the practice of logic. In this case, the logical conclusion that the universe in and of itself MUST have had a "first cause", and as a result, something or someone HAD to have caused that first cause.) As the worldwide news of this incredible discovery spreads, and the device itself is constructed, we are consistently shown both sides of the debate, neither viewpoint canceling out the other. Perpetual questions are raised: Are we alone in the universe? If not, who or what are our neighbors? Where are we in terms of evolution in comparison to any other lifeforms that may or may not exist? These questions are explored, but the answers left ambiguously unanswered, leaving the viewer forced to come to their own conclusion, their own process of determining the truth. Just one more thing...the final thirty minutes or so of "Contact" provide Foster's uncovering of what may or may not be the answers she, and we too, all are seeking. And then, there is a scene, which I'll not spoil for you, that shows Foster's attaining closure with a loved one who initiated her path in life. If you have a human heart beating within you, and you've ever mourned or yearned for someone you've lost, this scene will have you in tears, just as it's done to me again and again... In the end, "Contact" urges us all to find our own answers to the burning questions we have in our minds. As a parable of society's perception of faith vs. fact, it is superlative. As a study of humanity and it's place in the universe, it simply is perfection. If you've not seen "Contact" before, you owe it to yourself to experience this at least once in your life. What a beautiful film.

    Jodi Foster makes this movie, with strong assists from Matthew McConaughey and Tom Skerritt. McConaughey does a good job with a difficult and contradictory character by trying to juxtapose the character's desire to believe in a generalist (philosophical definition) God with the humanist ethic of valuing the individual. Doesn't always work. Skerritt's character is more one-dimensional and so, so familiar for anyone who's every encountered one of these types in academia, the military or business hierarchies. Hard to see them as human and Skerritt does a bang-up job of portraying the type. But it's Foster's performance as Arroway that lights-up the screen. Jena Malone (young Ellie) needs to be mentioned here for her own stellar performance in setting the stage for Foster and making the transition believable. But once Foster appears, that's the ballgame. Even when plot elements break down (great script but it does breakdown when the contradictions overwhelm it), Foster's performance carries through. You could care less about the plot. And there are a lot of plot breakdowns, particularly in terms of the logistics of the Contact. First one: Vega never received coherent radio or TV transmissions from Earth - they would have dissipated before leaving the Solar System, let alone covering 25 light years. Secondly, the first thing any culture would do is establish its identity, the "Me Tarzan" thing. Then there's the Machine - schematics sent without any description of what, precisely, it does. Sell me a bridge. And then there's a whole host of other problems - if the Vegans had the technology to build such a machine, why not use it instead of beaming signals limited to the speed of light? Surely they would have the technology to identify Earth and do a spectrographic analysis of our atmosphere to see if it was compatible with theirs. And, assuming they could parse images out of those primitive TV signals, why not watch a while and then send a slightly more personal and focused message? But that's not what the movie's about and the suspension of disbelief covers most of those issues. The movie is really about the Wonder of the Universe and the point of the Contact is to emphasis that wonder, not watching alien home movies. So, as illogical as it is, it makes a lot more dramatic sense to portray the Contact as a great mystery sent to us for unraveling. This is where Malone and Foster's performances shine, projecting that sense of wonder with energy and passion from the first scene to the last, gluing your eyes to the screen. Personally, the only part I didn't buy was her brief sojourn at where-ever-it-was beachy kind of place where she met her father again and what the hell is this all about? I get it in dramatic and thematic terms but, for me, it grates like a bad dream sequence. Even at that, the movie recovers magnificently by focusing on the What Happened? issue after the capsule just kind of goes splat! when the Machine is turn on. Empirically, nothing - it just drops despite Arroway's passionate insistence she went Somewhere. While the Somewhere doesn't work for me as a Somewhere, it works better than a prosaic Welcome to Vegan, Earthling! sign would have so you take what you get. And I found the What Happened controversy surprising engaging as it led to the final scene, Foster sitting on the edge of a New Mexican cliff and seeing the Universe in a handful of soil. Blake, anyone? That is what Contact is all about, Emerson and Blake: seeing the Universe in a grain of sand and the Transcendent perception of its workings. Foster's performance is an elegant expression of that quest.

    Science vs Religion. I wouldn't want to get stuck in an elevator with either representative, but then again, the concept of one side having a small inkling of how the other thinks made for a life affirming journey for Dr. Ellie Arroway (played by the eternally adorable Jodi Foster). Visually adventurous and theoretically interesting, Contact succeeds ala Indiana Jones in adventure and truth seeking yet fails every time that Matthew McConaughey smirks for the camera as casting clearly opted for box office over suspicion of disbelief. But it doesn't take away from the search for the truth, only reminds you that the powers that be that make movies that are marketed just get out of their own way. Thumbs up to James Woods governmental response the the message from the sky!

    I have seen this movie a number of times and I watched it again last night on TV. I do not understand how anyone who could call this movie "bad." The story is not perfect but even with its faults, this is the type of movie which I can watch over and over. Carl Sagan is an amazing Science Fiction writer. And this movie is a lasting tribute. The performances are superb. Jodie Foster is believable as a driven female scientist who transitions from skeptic to true believer in life beyond what is know to us. Th story telling, cinematography and acting all make this film a classic. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who like science fiction,superb story telling and great acting.

    This movie is based on a novel bearing the same name which is Carl Edward Sagan's only work of fiction that he ever wrote. Carl Sagan is one of my heroes largely because of his Peabody award-winning Cosmos series. Sagan was willing to envision civilizations far more advanced than we are but reused to ignore the laws of physics when writing his novel Contact. Sagan had a friend at Cal-tech named Kip Throne who is a theoretical physicist who worked on wormholes and the nature of space and time whom consulted him on Contact. This movie was the #1 best astronomy movie according to Astronomy Magazine because it was a realistic depiction of contact with an alien civilization. Contact was very well written and deep, and I can totally relate to this movie. My favorite part was when Ellie went in the dodecahedron pod on that machine and traveled through wormholes and saw stars and galaxies and landed on a beach on a planet near the center of our galaxy where see saw an apparition of her father. This movie is currently my #2 favorite only second to Avatar and is a great homage to astronomy.

Doesn't always work. Skerritt's character is more one-dimensional and so, so familiar for anyone who's every encountered one of these types in academia, the military or business hierarchies. Hard to see them as human and Skerritt does a bang-up job of portraying the type. But it's Foster's performance as Arroway that lights-up the screen. Jena Malone (young Ellie) needs to be mentioned here for her own stellar performance in setting the stage for Foster and making the transition believable. But once Foster appears, that's the ballgame. Even when plot elements break down (great script but it does breakdown when the contradictions overwhelm it), Foster's performance carries through. You could care less about the plot. And there are a lot of plot breakdowns, particularly in terms of the logistics of the Contact. First one: Vega never received coherent radio or TV transmissions from Earth - they would have dissipated before leaving the Solar System, let alone covering 25 light years. Secondly, the first thing any culture would do is establish its identity, the "Me Tarzan" thing. Then there's the Machine - schematics sent without any description of what, precisely, it does. Sell me a bridge. And then there's a whole host of other problems - if the Vegans had the technology to build such a machine, why not use it instead of beaming signals limited to the speed of light? Surely they would have the technology to identify Earth and do a spectrographic analysis of our atmosphere to see if it was compatible with theirs. And, assuming they could parse images out of those primitive TV signals, why not watch a while and then send a slightly more personal and focused message? But that's not what the movie's about and the suspension of disbelief covers most of those issues. The movie is really about the Wonder of the Universe and the point of the Contact is to emphasis that wonder, not watching alien home movies. So, as illogical as it is, it makes a lot more dramatic sense to portray the Contact as a great mystery sent to us for unraveling. This is where Malone and Foster's performances shine, projecting that sense of wonder with energy and passion from the first scene to the last, gluing your eyes to the screen. Personally, the only part I didn't buy was her brief sojourn at where-ever-it-was beachy kind of place where she met her father again and what the hell is this all about? I get it in dramatic and thematic terms but, for me, it grates like a bad dream sequence. Even at that, the movie recovers magnificently by focusing on the What Happened? issue after the capsule just kind of goes splat! when the Machine is turn on. Empirically, nothing - it just drops despite Arroway's passionate insistence she went Somewhere. While the Somewhere doesn't work for me as a Somewhere, it works better than a prosaic Welcome to Vegan, Earthling! sign would have so you take what you get. And I found the What Happened controversy surprising engaging as it led to the final scene, Foster sitting on the edge of a New Mexican cliff and seeing the Universe in a handful of soil. Blake, anyone? That is what Contact is all about, Emerson and Blake: seeing the Universe in a grain of sand and the Transcendent perception of its workings. Foster's performance is an elegant expression of that quest.

    Science vs Religion. I wouldn't want to get stuck in an elevator with either representative, but then again, the concept of one side having a small inkling of how the other thinks made for a life affirming journey for Dr. Ellie Arroway (played by the eternally adorable Jodi Foster). Visually adventurous and theoretically interesting, Contact succeeds ala Indiana Jones in adventure and truth seeking yet fails every time that Matthew McConaughey smirks for the camera as casting clearly opted for box office over suspicion of disbelief. But it doesn't take away from the search for the truth, only reminds you that the powers that be that make movies that are marketed just get out of their own way. Thumbs up to James Woods governmental response the the message from the sky!

    I have seen this movie a number of times and I watched it again last night on TV. I do not understand how anyone who could call this movie "bad." The story is not perfect but even with its faults, this is the type of movie which I can watch over and over. Carl Sagan is an amazing Science Fiction writer. And this movie is a lasting tribute. The performances are superb. Jodie Foster is believable as a driven female scientist who transitions from skeptic to true believer in life beyond what is know to us. Th story telling, cinematography and acting all make this film a classic. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who like science fiction,superb story telling and great acting.

    This movie is based on a novel bearing the same name which is Carl Edward Sagan's only work of fiction that he ever wrote. Carl Sagan is one of my heroes largely because of his Peabody award-winning Cosmos series. Sagan was willing to envision civilizations far more advanced than we are but reused to ignore the laws of physics when writing his novel Contact. Sagan had a friend at Cal-tech named Kip Throne who is a theoretical physicist who worked on wormholes and the nature of space and time whom consulted him on Contact. This movie was the #1 best astronomy movie according to Astronomy Magazine because it was a realistic depiction of contact with an alien civilization. Contact was very well written and deep, and I can totally relate to this movie. My favorite part was when Ellie went in the dodecahedron pod on that machine and traveled through wormholes and saw stars and galaxies and landed on a beach on a planet near the center of our galaxy where see saw an apparition of her father. This movie is currently my #2 favorite only second to Avatar and is a great homage to astronomy.

    Contact is an incredible movie that touches upon the intricate subject of both science and religion as well as their somewhat opposing values and beliefs. This notion is clearly depicted in the form of human relationship, particularly speaking, the relationship between Eleanor Arroway and Palmor Joss, a scientist and a priest. Their contrasting beliefs and ideologies together with their shared love for each other shows not only the difference between science and religion but also their similarities. Both Jodie Foster and Matthew McConaughey did a brilliant job at playing their roles. Overall, it was a delightful experience to watch a fictional story of the event of alien contact. One complaint though, on my part, is that most of the antagonistic elements of the movie such as Drumlin or Kitz, are all depicted as ignorant and arrogant power figures that do nothing more than annoy and constrain the main character, which seems quite stupid in all honesty. In a global effort to make contact with an alien civilization, would such people really go as far as take advantage of an honest and talented scientist, whose discovery has literally altered the course of history, simply for the reason of personal gain? All Drumlin did was finish Arroway's sentences and steal her glory while pretending to be innocent. Same goes for Kitz, all he did was criticize when everything seemed like it went to toilet. These details might seem minor but I feel like they were a bit exaggerated really. But they are what they are, only minor annoyances, doesn't in any way affect the great story. 7.5/10 would watch again.

    I'm kind of sciencefiction fanatic but for some reason Contact never attracted me. But after hearing some OK stories I decided to view it after all this time it was released. Beforehand I knew it was about mankind making contact with an alien source and the whole builtup to that happening was executed very good. The whole deciphering part of the signal felt a bit like an Indiana Jones adventure. Very smart writing. What I didn't like at all was that I felt the director was trying to please both the church goers and scientists. I got no clue at all why a huge chunk of the story was reserved for a science vs religion debate. What was the point? And to please the atheists/scientist a fundamental Christian terrorist was thrown in. Like he wanted to say "hey you can't blame me that I must be sponsored by the church! I wrote a Christian terrorist in the story!" It all felt really misplaced for me. Like a scene from a different movie. They could have written out the whole Matthew McConaughey part and it would be a better movie. His role was just stupid. For a scifi geek the whole building of the wormhole-portal machine was just great. And it got even better when the whole travelling part began. After watching the intro of the movie where we saw the planet Earth zooming out to our Galaxy, then clusters and then the whole Universe I was hoping that something would happen again and it did. With wormhole travelling. It really felt like a roller-coaster ride. The actual arrival on the alien planet felt a bit disappointing. The alien who dressed up as her dad was lame. Maybe it was original then but I just wanted to see the imagination of what an alien lifeform would look like according to the director. So that was disappointing. So if the story would be all about Jody Fosters ambition without the pointless religion crap and the love affair with Matthew McConaughey I would have given it an 8 probably. Now a 6 but still a good watch.

    This movie pretends to be intelligent but is not. It is full of plot and factual holes. There are too numerous so I will just address the most glaring ones. First, the most glaring 'factual' hole: the 'first public TV broadcast of 1936 cannot possibly have reached Vega and responded to by the time-frame the movie is set: as of now the signal has barely entered the outer-limits of the solar system!!! Now the most glaring plot hole that seems to have so far escaped any mention: the machine in Hokkaido is NOT one time use only machine--why didn't anybody after the Jody Foster character get on the machine and verify what she said was indeed what actually happened? Was the damage to the chair assembly (caused by the character's getting off to retrieve the necklace)too severe to be repaired???? Come on, it does not make sense.

    I remember I saw this movie when I was little and I liked it a lot. However, now I was convinced the reason I had liked it so much was the excitement and curiosity it had stirred in me while watching it, and I didn't expect it to be so meaningful as I discovered it to be when re- watching it now, after approx. 12 years since I saw it. This movie is building up on existential questions we all have asked ourselves at one point or another in our lives: Are we alone in this Universe? Is there a God? What is the purpose of our life? etc). As the movie progresses, the feeling of getting closer to answering those questions is getting stronger and stronger, until it reaches it's climax: the part where you'll find yourself just observing, full of curiosity and excitement. The ending has its own unique way of answering those questions. Given the fact that it tackles such controversial, hard, essential questions and problems, one would expect this movie to collapse in an annoying unsatisfying feeling at the end. Well, it doesn't. This movie is a true work of art. Brilliant!

    Carl Sagan is a hero of mine. I admit it. Him and Richard Feynman. If more people had them as role-models instead of sports-stars, actors and models the world would look a very different place, to the better. Sagan never took opposition to religion, he merely asked: if there is a creator, who created him? In this masterpiece he again leans towards that question with religion being portrayed by Matt M and science by Jodie Foster. Of course science is the main focus and i remember Sagan in his TV- series "Cosmos" often contemplating how a Non-Terrestial-Intelligence would contact us and that his conclusion was by mathematics, in this case prime numbers. This movie is great and has a message that speaks to many people: Have an open mind and be curious about the world and cosmos we live in, and that we are not alone in this universe. This movie is a lost gem in many ways, people these days just needs their quick-fix action-flick. That's sad.

    From the mind of astronomer Carl Sagan, and flawlessly directed by Robert Zemeckis, "Contact" tells the story of a young astronomer/scientist named Ellie Arroway, played to perfection by Jodie Foster, who discovers a message from outer space that may finally be proof of intelligent life in the universe. The message is mathematical in nature, but basically details blueprints for a vehicle intended to bring its occupant to the star Vega, from where the message is originating. Director Zemeckis is in familiar waters here, blending fiction seamlessly with reality; such as actual footage from press conferences with former president Bill Clinton, as well as cameos by a host of news personalities, all playing themselves. What Zemeckis started in "Forrest Gump" is refined and improved in "Contact", an unfairly underrated and under-appreciated parable about science, religion and the great gulf that separates them. In addition to Jodie Foster's superlative work, more outstanding performances from stars such as James Woods, Tom Skerritt and Matthew McConaughey round out a truly stellar cast, pun definitely intended. In the course of the story, the argument of "god" vs. science is brought up consistently, but Zemeckis wisely refrains from taking a side here, instead allowing the viewer to make their own decision on which "truth" is the real one. (On a personal note: I, myself, would be classified as a "non-believer" HOWEVER, I also subscribe to the practice of logic. In this case, the logical conclusion that the universe in and of itself MUST have had a "first cause", and as a result, something or someone HAD to have caused that first cause.) As the worldwide news of this incredible discovery spreads, and the device itself is constructed, we are consistently shown both sides of the debate, neither viewpoint canceling out the other. Perpetual questions are raised: Are we alone in the universe? If not, who or what are our neighbors? Where are we in terms of evolution in comparison to any other lifeforms that may or may not exist? These questions are explored, but the answers left ambiguously unanswered, leaving the viewer forced to come to their own conclusion, their own process of determining the truth. Just one more thing...the final thirty minutes or so of "Contact" provide Foster's uncovering of what may or may not be the answers she, and we too, all are seeking. And then, there is a scene, which I'll not spoil for you, that shows Foster's attaining closure with a loved one who initiated her path in life. If you have a human heart beating within you, and you've ever mourned or yearned for someone you've lost, this scene will have you in tears, just as it's done to me again and again... In the end, "Contact" urges us all to find our own answers to the burning questions we have in our minds. As a parable of society's perception of faith vs. fact, it is superlative. As a study of humanity and it's place in the universe, it simply is perfection. If you've not seen "Contact" before, you owe it to yourself to experience this at least once in your life. What a beautiful film.

Doesn't always work. Skerritt's character is more one-dimensional and so, so familiar for anyone who's every encountered one of these types in academia, the military or business hierarchies.

Secondly, the first thing any culture would do is establish its identity, the "Me Tarzan" thing. Then there's the Machine - schematics sent without any description of what, precisely, it does. Sell me a bridge. And then there's a whole host of other problems - if the Vegans had the technology to build such a machine, why not use it instead of beaming signals limited to the speed of light? Surely they would have the technology to identify Earth and do a spectrographic analysis of our atmosphere to see if it was compatible with theirs.

    From the mind of astronomer Carl Sagan, and flawlessly directed by Robert Zemeckis, "Contact" tells the story of a young astronomer/scientist named Ellie Arroway, played to perfection by Jodie Foster, who discovers a message from outer space that may finally be proof of intelligent life in the universe. The message is mathematical in nature, but basically details blueprints for a vehicle intended to bring its occupant to the star Vega, from where the message is originating. Director Zemeckis is in familiar waters here, blending fiction seamlessly with reality; such as actual footage from press conferences with former president Bill Clinton, as well as cameos by a host of news personalities, all playing themselves. What Zemeckis started in "Forrest Gump" is refined and improved in "Contact", an unfairly underrated and under-appreciated parable about science, religion and the great gulf that separates them. In addition to Jodie Foster's superlative work, more outstanding performances from stars such as James Woods, Tom Skerritt and Matthew McConaughey round out a truly stellar cast, pun definitely intended. In the course of the story, the argument of "god" vs. science is brought up consistently, but Zemeckis wisely refrains from taking a side here, instead allowing the viewer to make their own decision on which "truth" is the real one. (On a personal note: I, myself, would be classified as a "non-believer" HOWEVER, I also subscribe to the practice of logic. In this case, the logical conclusion that the universe in and of itself MUST have had a "first cause", and as a result, something or someone HAD to have caused that first cause.) As the worldwide news of this incredible discovery spreads, and the device itself is constructed, we are consistently shown both sides of the debate, neither viewpoint canceling out the other. Perpetual questions are raised: Are we alone in the universe? If not, who or what are our neighbors? Where are we in terms of evolution in comparison to any other lifeforms that may or may not exist? These questions are explored, but the answers left ambiguously unanswered, leaving the viewer forced to come to their own conclusion, their own process of determining the truth. Just one more thing...the final thirty minutes or so of "Contact" provide Foster's uncovering of what may or may not be the answers she, and we too, all are seeking. And then, there is a scene, which I'll not spoil for you, that shows Foster's attaining closure with a loved one who initiated her path in life. If you have a human heart beating within you, and you've ever mourned or yearned for someone you've lost, this scene will have you in tears, just as it's done to me again and again... In the end, "Contact" urges us all to find our own answers to the burning questions we have in our minds. As a parable of society's perception of faith vs. fact, it is superlative. As a study of humanity and it's place in the universe, it simply is perfection. If you've not seen "Contact" before, you owe it to yourself to experience this at least once in your life. What a beautiful film.

    Jodi Foster makes this movie, with strong assists from Matthew McConaughey and Tom Skerritt. McConaughey does a good job with a difficult and contradictory character by trying to juxtapose the character's desire to believe in a generalist (philosophical definition) God with the humanist ethic of valuing the individual. Doesn't always work. Skerritt's character is more one-dimensional and so, so familiar for anyone who's every encountered one of these types in academia, the military or business hierarchies. Hard to see them as human and Skerritt does a bang-up job of portraying the type. But it's Foster's performance as Arroway that lights-up the screen. Jena Malone (young Ellie) needs to be mentioned here for her own stellar performance in setting the stage for Foster and making the transition believable. But once Foster appears, that's the ballgame. Even when plot elements break down (great script but it does breakdown when the contradictions overwhelm it), Foster's performance carries through. You could care less about the plot. And there are a lot of plot breakdowns, particularly in terms of the logistics of the Contact. First one: Vega never received coherent radio or TV transmissions from Earth - they would have dissipated before leaving the Solar System, let alone covering 25 light years. Secondly, the first thing any culture would do is establish its identity, the "Me Tarzan" thing. Then there's the Machine - schematics sent without any description of what, precisely, it does. Sell me a bridge. And then there's a whole host of other problems - if the Vegans had the technology to build such a machine, why not use it instead of beaming signals limited to the speed of light? Surely they would have the technology to identify Earth and do a spectrographic analysis of our atmosphere to see if it was compatible with theirs. And, assuming they could parse images out of those primitive TV signals, why not watch a while and then send a slightly more personal and focused message? But that's not what the movie's about and the suspension of disbelief covers most of those issues. The movie is really about the Wonder of the Universe and the point of the Contact is to emphasis that wonder, not watching alien home movies. So, as illogical as it is, it makes a lot more dramatic sense to portray the Contact as a great mystery sent to us for unraveling. This is where Malone and Foster's performances shine, projecting that sense of wonder with energy and passion from the first scene to the last, gluing your eyes to the screen. Personally, the only part I didn't buy was her brief sojourn at where-ever-it-was beachy kind of place where she met her father again and what the hell is this all about? I get it in dramatic and thematic terms but, for me, it grates like a bad dream sequence. Even at that, the movie recovers magnificently by focusing on the What Happened? issue after the capsule just kind of goes splat! when the Machine is turn on. Empirically, nothing - it just drops despite Arroway's passionate insistence she went Somewhere. While the Somewhere doesn't work for me as a Somewhere, it works better than a prosaic Welcome to Vegan, Earthling! sign would have so you take what you get. And I found the What Happened controversy surprising engaging as it led to the final scene, Foster sitting on the edge of a New Mexican cliff and seeing the Universe in a handful of soil. Blake, anyone? That is what Contact is all about, Emerson and Blake: seeing the Universe in a grain of sand and the Transcendent perception of its workings. Foster's performance is an elegant expression of that quest.

    Science vs Religion. I wouldn't want to get stuck in an elevator with either representative, but then again, the concept of one side having a small inkling of how the other thinks made for a life affirming journey for Dr. Ellie Arroway (played by the eternally adorable Jodi Foster). Visually adventurous and theoretically interesting, Contact succeeds ala Indiana Jones in adventure and truth seeking yet fails every time that Matthew McConaughey smirks for the camera as casting clearly opted for box office over suspicion of disbelief. But it doesn't take away from the search for the truth, only reminds you that the powers that be that make movies that are marketed just get out of their own way. Thumbs up to James Woods governmental response the the message from the sky!

    I have seen this movie a number of times and I watched it again last night on TV. I do not understand how anyone who could call this movie "bad." The story is not perfect but even with its faults, this is the type of movie which I can watch over and over. Carl Sagan is an amazing Science Fiction writer. And this movie is a lasting tribute. The performances are superb. Jodie Foster is believable as a driven female scientist who transitions from skeptic to true believer in life beyond what is know to us. Th story telling, cinematography and acting all make this film a classic. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who like science fiction,superb story telling and great acting.

    This movie is based on a novel bearing the same name which is Carl Edward Sagan's only work of fiction that he ever wrote. Carl Sagan is one of my heroes largely because of his Peabody award-winning Cosmos series. Sagan was willing to envision civilizations far more advanced than we are but reused to ignore the laws of physics when writing his novel Contact. Sagan had a friend at Cal-tech named Kip Throne who is a theoretical physicist who worked on wormholes and the nature of space and time whom consulted him on Contact. This movie was the #1 best astronomy movie according to Astronomy Magazine because it was a realistic depiction of contact with an alien civilization. Contact was very well written and deep, and I can totally relate to this movie. My favorite part was when Ellie went in the dodecahedron pod on that machine and traveled through wormholes and saw stars and galaxies and landed on a beach on a planet near the center of our galaxy where see saw an apparition of her father. This movie is currently my #2 favorite only second to Avatar and is a great homage to astronomy.

    Contact is an incredible movie that touches upon the intricate subject of both science and religion as well as their somewhat opposing values and beliefs. This notion is clearly depicted in the form of human relationship, particularly speaking, the relationship between Eleanor Arroway and Palmor Joss, a scientist and a priest. Their contrasting beliefs and ideologies together with their shared love for each other shows not only the difference between science and religion but also their similarities. Both Jodie Foster and Matthew McConaughey did a brilliant job at playing their roles. Overall, it was a delightful experience to watch a fictional story of the event of alien contact. One complaint though, on my part, is that most of the antagonistic elements of the movie such as Drumlin or Kitz, are all depicted as ignorant and arrogant power figures that do nothing more than annoy and constrain the main character, which seems quite stupid in all honesty. In a global effort to make contact with an alien civilization, would such people really go as far as take advantage of an honest and talented scientist, whose discovery has literally altered the course of history, simply for the reason of personal gain? All Drumlin did was finish Arroway's sentences and steal her glory while pretending to be innocent. Same goes for Kitz, all he did was criticize when everything seemed like it went to toilet. These details might seem minor but I feel like they were a bit exaggerated really. But they are what they are, only minor annoyances, doesn't in any way affect the great story. 7.5/10 would watch again.

    I'm kind of sciencefiction fanatic but for some reason Contact never attracted me. But after hearing some OK stories I decided to view it after all this time it was released. Beforehand I knew it was about mankind making contact with an alien source and the whole builtup to that happening was executed very good. The whole deciphering part of the signal felt a bit like an Indiana Jones adventure. Very smart writing. What I didn't like at all was that I felt the director was trying to please both the church goers and scientists. I got no clue at all why a huge chunk of the story was reserved for a science vs religion debate. What was the point? And to please the atheists/scientist a fundamental Christian terrorist was thrown in. Like he wanted to say "hey you can't blame me that I must be sponsored by the church! I wrote a Christian terrorist in the story!" It all felt really misplaced for me. Like a scene from a different movie. They could have written out the whole Matthew McConaughey part and it would be a better movie. His role was just stupid. For a scifi geek the whole building of the wormhole-portal machine was just great. And it got even better when the whole travelling part began. After watching the intro of the movie where we saw the planet Earth zooming out to our Galaxy, then clusters and then the whole Universe I was hoping that something would happen again and it did. With wormhole travelling. It really felt like a roller-coaster ride. The actual arrival on the alien planet felt a bit disappointing. The alien who dressed up as her dad was lame. Maybe it was original then but I just wanted to see the imagination of what an alien lifeform would look like according to the director. So that was disappointing. So if the story would be all about Jody Fosters ambition without the pointless religion crap and the love affair with Matthew McConaughey I would have given it an 8 probably. Now a 6 but still a good watch.

    This movie pretends to be intelligent but is not. It is full of plot and factual holes. There are too numerous so I will just address the most glaring ones. First, the most glaring 'factual' hole: the 'first public TV broadcast of 1936 cannot possibly have reached Vega and responded to by the time-frame the movie is set: as of now the signal has barely entered the outer-limits of the solar system!!! Now the most glaring plot hole that seems to have so far escaped any mention: the machine in Hokkaido is NOT one time use only machine--why didn't anybody after the Jody Foster character get on the machine and verify what she said was indeed what actually happened? Was the damage to the chair assembly (caused by the character's getting off to retrieve the necklace)too severe to be repaired???? Come on, it does not make sense.

    I remember I saw this movie when I was little and I liked it a lot. However, now I was convinced the reason I had liked it so much was the excitement and curiosity it had stirred in me while watching it, and I didn't expect it to be so meaningful as I discovered it to be when re- watching it now, after approx. 12 years since I saw it. This movie is building up on existential questions we all have asked ourselves at one point or another in our lives: Are we alone in this Universe? Is there a God? What is the purpose of our life? etc). As the movie progresses, the feeling of getting closer to answering those questions is getting stronger and stronger, until it reaches it's climax: the part where you'll find yourself just observing, full of curiosity and excitement. The ending has its own unique way of answering those questions. Given the fact that it tackles such controversial, hard, essential questions and problems, one would expect this movie to collapse in an annoying unsatisfying feeling at the end. Well, it doesn't. This movie is a true work of art. Brilliant!

    Carl Sagan is a hero of mine. I admit it. Him and Richard Feynman. If more people had them as role-models instead of sports-stars, actors and models the world would look a very different place, to the better. Sagan never took opposition to religion, he merely asked: if there is a creator, who created him? In this masterpiece he again leans towards that question with religion being portrayed by Matt M and science by Jodie Foster. Of course science is the main focus and i remember Sagan in his TV- series "Cosmos" often contemplating how a Non-Terrestial-Intelligence would contact us and that his conclusion was by mathematics, in this case prime numbers. This movie is great and has a message that speaks to many people: Have an open mind and be curious about the world and cosmos we live in, and that we are not alone in this universe. This movie is a lost gem in many ways, people these days just needs their quick-fix action-flick. That's sad.

    This movie pretends to be intelligent but is not. It is full of plot and factual holes. There are too numerous so I will just address the most glaring ones. First, the most glaring 'factual' hole: the 'first public TV broadcast of 1936 cannot possibly have reached Vega and responded to by the time-frame the movie is set: as of now the signal has barely entered the outer-limits of the solar system!!! Now the most glaring plot hole that seems to have so far escaped any mention: the machine in Hokkaido is NOT one time use only machine--why didn't anybody after the Jody Foster character get on the machine and verify what she said was indeed what actually happened? Was the damage to the chair assembly (caused by the character's getting off to retrieve the necklace)too severe to be repaired???? Come on, it does not make sense.

    I remember I saw this movie when I was little and I liked it a lot. However, now I was convinced the reason I had liked it so much was the excitement and curiosity it had stirred in me while watching it, and I didn't expect it to be so meaningful as I discovered it to be when re- watching it now, after approx. 12 years since I saw it. This movie is building up on existential questions we all have asked ourselves at one point or another in our lives: Are we alone in this Universe? Is there a God? What is the purpose of our life? etc). As the movie progresses, the feeling of getting closer to answering those questions is getting stronger and stronger, until it reaches it's climax: the part where you'll find yourself just observing, full of curiosity and excitement. The ending has its own unique way of answering those questions. Given the fact that it tackles such controversial, hard, essential questions and problems, one would expect this movie to collapse in an annoying unsatisfying feeling at the end. Well, it doesn't. This movie is a true work of art. Brilliant!

    Carl Sagan is a hero of mine. I admit it. Him and Richard Feynman. If more people had them as role-models instead of sports-stars, actors and models the world would look a very different place, to the better. Sagan never took opposition to religion, he merely asked: if there is a creator, who created him? In this masterpiece he again leans towards that question with religion being portrayed by Matt M and science by Jodie Foster. Of course science is the main focus and i remember Sagan in his TV- series "Cosmos" often contemplating how a Non-Terrestial-Intelligence would contact us and that his conclusion was by mathematics, in this case prime numbers. This movie is great and has a message that speaks to many people: Have an open mind and be curious about the world and cosmos we live in, and that we are not alone in this universe. This movie is a lost gem in many ways, people these days just needs their quick-fix action-flick. That's sad.

    From the mind of astronomer Carl Sagan, and flawlessly directed by Robert Zemeckis, "Contact" tells the story of a young astronomer/scientist named Ellie Arroway, played to perfection by Jodie Foster, who discovers a message from outer space that may finally be proof of intelligent life in the universe. The message is mathematical in nature, but basically details blueprints for a vehicle intended to bring its occupant to the star Vega, from where the message is originating. Director Zemeckis is in familiar waters here, blending fiction seamlessly with reality; such as actual footage from press conferences with former president Bill Clinton, as well as cameos by a host of news personalities, all playing themselves. What Zemeckis started in "Forrest Gump" is refined and improved in "Contact", an unfairly underrated and under-appreciated parable about science, religion and the great gulf that separates them. In addition to Jodie Foster's superlative work, more outstanding performances from stars such as James Woods, Tom Skerritt and Matthew McConaughey round out a truly stellar cast, pun definitely intended. In the course of the story, the argument of "god" vs. science is brought up consistently, but Zemeckis wisely refrains from taking a side here, instead allowing the viewer to make their own decision on which "truth" is the real one. (On a personal note: I, myself, would be classified as a "non-believer" HOWEVER, I also subscribe to the practice of logic. In this case, the logical conclusion that the universe in and of itself MUST have had a "first cause", and as a result, something or someone HAD to have caused that first cause.) As the worldwide news of this incredible discovery spreads, and the device itself is constructed, we are consistently shown both sides of the debate, neither viewpoint canceling out the other. Perpetual questions are raised: Are we alone in the universe? If not, who or what are our neighbors? Where are we in terms of evolution in comparison to any other lifeforms that may or may not exist? These questions are explored, but the answers left ambiguously unanswered, leaving the viewer forced to come to their own conclusion, their own process of determining the truth. Just one more thing...the final thirty minutes or so of "Contact" provide Foster's uncovering of what may or may not be the answers she, and we too, all are seeking. And then, there is a scene, which I'll not spoil for you, that shows Foster's attaining closure with a loved one who initiated her path in life. If you have a human heart beating within you, and you've ever mourned or yearned for someone you've lost, this scene will have you in tears, just as it's done to me again and again... In the end, "Contact" urges us all to find our own answers to the burning questions we have in our minds. As a parable of society's perception of faith vs. fact, it is superlative. As a study of humanity and it's place in the universe, it simply is perfection. If you've not seen "Contact" before, you owe it to yourself to experience this at least once in your life. What a beautiful film.

    Jodi Foster makes this movie, with strong assists from Matthew McConaughey and Tom Skerritt. McConaughey does a good job with a difficult and contradictory character by trying to juxtapose the character's desire to believe in a generalist (philosophical definition) God with the humanist ethic of valuing the individual. Doesn't always work. Skerritt's character is more one-dimensional and so, so familiar for anyone who's every encountered one of these types in academia, the military or business hierarchies. Hard to see them as human and Skerritt does a bang-up job of portraying the type. But it's Foster's performance as Arroway that lights-up the screen. Jena Malone (young Ellie) needs to be mentioned here for her own stellar performance in setting the stage for Foster and making the transition believable. But once Foster appears, that's the ballgame. Even when plot elements break down (great script but it does breakdown when the contradictions overwhelm it), Foster's performance carries through. You could care less about the plot. And there are a lot of plot breakdowns, particularly in terms of the logistics of the Contact. First one: Vega never received coherent radio or TV transmissions from Earth - they would have dissipated before leaving the Solar System, let alone covering 25 light years. Secondly, the first thing any culture would do is establish its identity, the "Me Tarzan" thing. Then there's the Machine - schematics sent without any description of what, precisely, it does. Sell me a bridge. And then there's a whole host of other problems - if the Vegans had the technology to build such a machine, why not use it instead of beaming signals limited to the speed of light? Surely they would have the technology to identify Earth and do a spectrographic analysis of our atmosphere to see if it was compatible with theirs. And, assuming they could parse images out of those primitive TV signals, why not watch a while and then send a slightly more personal and focused message? But that's not what the movie's about and the suspension of disbelief covers most of those issues. The movie is really about the Wonder of the Universe and the point of the Contact is to emphasis that wonder, not watching alien home movies. So, as illogical as it is, it makes a lot more dramatic sense to portray the Contact as a great mystery sent to us for unraveling. This is where Malone and Foster's performances shine, projecting that sense of wonder with energy and passion from the first scene to the last, gluing your eyes to the screen. Personally, the only part I didn't buy was her brief sojourn at where-ever-it-was beachy kind of place where she met her father again and what the hell is this all about? I get it in dramatic and thematic terms but, for me, it grates like a bad dream sequence. Even at that, the movie recovers magnificently by focusing on the What Happened? issue after the capsule just kind of goes splat! when the Machine is turn on. Empirically, nothing - it just drops despite Arroway's passionate insistence she went Somewhere. While the Somewhere doesn't work for me as a Somewhere, it works better than a prosaic Welcome to Vegan, Earthling! sign would have so you take what you get. And I found the What Happened controversy surprising engaging as it led to the final scene, Foster sitting on the edge of a New Mexican cliff and seeing the Universe in a handful of soil. Blake, anyone? That is what Contact is all about, Emerson and Blake: seeing the Universe in a grain of sand and the Transcendent perception of its workings. Foster's performance is an elegant expression of that quest.

    Science vs Religion. I wouldn't want to get stuck in an elevator with either representative, but then again, the concept of one side having a small inkling of how the other thinks made for a life affirming journey for Dr. Ellie Arroway (played by the eternally adorable Jodi Foster). Visually adventurous and theoretically interesting, Contact succeeds ala Indiana Jones in adventure and truth seeking yet fails every time that Matthew McConaughey smirks for the camera as casting clearly opted for box office over suspicion of disbelief. But it doesn't take away from the search for the truth, only reminds you that the powers that be that make movies that are marketed just get out of their own way. Thumbs up to James Woods governmental response the the message from the sky!

    I have seen this movie a number of times and I watched it again last night on TV. I do not understand how anyone who could call this movie "bad." The story is not perfect but even with its faults, this is the type of movie which I can watch over and over. Carl Sagan is an amazing Science Fiction writer. And this movie is a lasting tribute. The performances are superb. Jodie Foster is believable as a driven female scientist who transitions from skeptic to true believer in life beyond what is know to us. Th story telling, cinematography and acting all make this film a classic. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who like science fiction,superb story telling and great acting.

    This movie is based on a novel bearing the same name which is Carl Edward Sagan's only work of fiction that he ever wrote. Carl Sagan is one of my heroes largely because of his Peabody award-winning Cosmos series. Sagan was willing to envision civilizations far more advanced than we are but reused to ignore the laws of physics when writing his novel Contact. Sagan had a friend at Cal-tech named Kip Throne who is a theoretical physicist who worked on wormholes and the nature of space and time whom consulted him on Contact. This movie was the #1 best astronomy movie according to Astronomy Magazine because it was a realistic depiction of contact with an alien civilization. Contact was very well written and deep, and I can totally relate to this movie. My favorite part was when Ellie went in the dodecahedron pod on that machine and traveled through wormholes and saw stars and galaxies and landed on a beach on a planet near the center of our galaxy where see saw an apparition of her father. This movie is currently my #2 favorite only second to Avatar and is a great homage to astronomy.

    Contact is an incredible movie that touches upon the intricate subject of both science and religion as well as their somewhat opposing values and beliefs. This notion is clearly depicted in the form of human relationship, particularly speaking, the relationship between Eleanor Arroway and Palmor Joss, a scientist and a priest. Their contrasting beliefs and ideologies together with their shared love for each other shows not only the difference between science and religion but also their similarities. Both Jodie Foster and Matthew McConaughey did a brilliant job at playing their roles. Overall, it was a delightful experience to watch a fictional story of the event of alien contact. One complaint though, on my part, is that most of the antagonistic elements of the movie such as Drumlin or Kitz, are all depicted as ignorant and arrogant power figures that do nothing more than annoy and constrain the main character, which seems quite stupid in all honesty. In a global effort to make contact with an alien civilization, would such people really go as far as take advantage of an honest and talented scientist, whose discovery has literally altered the course of history, simply for the reason of personal gain? All Drumlin did was finish Arroway's sentences and steal her glory while pretending to be innocent. Same goes for Kitz, all he did was criticize when everything seemed like it went to toilet. These details might seem minor but I feel like they were a bit exaggerated really. But they are what they are, only minor annoyances, doesn't in any way affect the great story. 7.5/10 would watch again.

    I'm kind of sciencefiction fanatic but for some reason Contact never attracted me. But after hearing some OK stories I decided to view it after all this time it was released. Beforehand I knew it was about mankind making contact with an alien source and the whole builtup to that happening was executed very good. The whole deciphering part of the signal felt a bit like an Indiana Jones adventure. Very smart writing. What I didn't like at all was that I felt the director was trying to please both the church goers and scientists. I got no clue at all why a huge chunk of the story was reserved for a science vs religion debate. What was the point? And to please the atheists/scientist a fundamental Christian terrorist was thrown in. Like he wanted to say "hey you can't blame me that I must be sponsored by the church! I wrote a Christian terrorist in the story!" It all felt really misplaced for me. Like a scene from a different movie. They could have written out the whole Matthew McConaughey part and it would be a better movie. His role was just stupid. For a scifi geek the whole building of the wormhole-portal machine was just great. And it got even better when the whole travelling part began. After watching the intro of the movie where we saw the planet Earth zooming out to our Galaxy, then clusters and then the whole Universe I was hoping that something would happen again and it did. With wormhole travelling. It really felt like a roller-coaster ride. The actual arrival on the alien planet felt a bit disappointing. The alien who dressed up as her dad was lame. Maybe it was original then but I just wanted to see the imagination of what an alien lifeform would look like according to the director. So that was disappointing. So if the story would be all about Jody Fosters ambition without the pointless religion crap and the love affair with Matthew McConaughey I would have given it an 8 probably. Now a 6 but still a good watch.

    Contact is an incredible movie that touches upon the intricate subject of both science and religion as well as their somewhat opposing values and beliefs. This notion is clearly depicted in the form of human relationship, particularly speaking, the relationship between Eleanor Arroway and Palmor Joss, a scientist and a priest. Their contrasting beliefs and ideologies together with their shared love for each other shows not only the difference between science and religion but also their similarities. Both Jodie Foster and Matthew McConaughey did a brilliant job at playing their roles. Overall, it was a delightful experience to watch a fictional story of the event of alien contact. One complaint though, on my part, is that most of the antagonistic elements of the movie such as Drumlin or Kitz, are all depicted as ignorant and arrogant power figures that do nothing more than annoy and constrain the main character, which seems quite stupid in all honesty. In a global effort to make contact with an alien civilization, would such people really go as far as take advantage of an honest and talented scientist, whose discovery has literally altered the course of history, simply for the reason of personal gain? All Drumlin did was finish Arroway's sentences and steal her glory while pretending to be innocent. Same goes for Kitz, all he did was criticize when everything seemed like it went to toilet. These details might seem minor but I feel like they were a bit exaggerated really. But they are what they are, only minor annoyances, doesn't in any way affect the great story. 7.5/10 would watch again.

    I'm kind of sciencefiction fanatic but for some reason Contact never attracted me. But after hearing some OK stories I decided to view it after all this time it was released. Beforehand I knew it was about mankind making contact with an alien source and the whole builtup to that happening was executed very good. The whole deciphering part of the signal felt a bit like an Indiana Jones adventure. Very smart writing. What I didn't like at all was that I felt the director was trying to please both the church goers and scientists. I got no clue at all why a huge chunk of the story was reserved for a science vs religion debate. What was the point? And to please the atheists/scientist a fundamental Christian terrorist was thrown in. Like he wanted to say "hey you can't blame me that I must be sponsored by the church! I wrote a Christian terrorist in the story!" It all felt really misplaced for me. Like a scene from a different movie. They could have written out the whole Matthew McConaughey part and it would be a better movie. His role was just stupid. For a scifi geek the whole building of the wormhole-portal machine was just great. And it got even better when the whole travelling part began. After watching the intro of the movie where we saw the planet Earth zooming out to our Galaxy, then clusters and then the whole Universe I was hoping that something would happen again and it did. With wormhole travelling. It really felt like a roller-coaster ride. The actual arrival on the alien planet felt a bit disappointing. The alien who dressed up as her dad was lame. Maybe it was original then but I just wanted to see the imagination of what an alien lifeform would look like according to the director. So that was disappointing. So if the story would be all about Jody Fosters ambition without the pointless religion crap and the love affair with Matthew McConaughey I would have given it an 8 probably. Now a 6 but still a good watch.

    This movie pretends to be intelligent but is not. It is full of plot and factual holes. There are too numerous so I will just address the most glaring ones. First, the most glaring 'factual' hole: the 'first public TV broadcast of 1936 cannot possibly have reached Vega and responded to by the time-frame the movie is set: as of now the signal has barely entered the outer-limits of the solar system!!! Now the most glaring plot hole that seems to have so far escaped any mention: the machine in Hokkaido is NOT one time use only machine--why didn't anybody after the Jody Foster character get on the machine and verify what she said was indeed what actually happened? Was the damage to the chair assembly (caused by the character's getting off to retrieve the necklace)too severe to be repaired???? Come on, it does not make sense.

    I remember I saw this movie when I was little and I liked it a lot. However, now I was convinced the reason I had liked it so much was the excitement and curiosity it had stirred in me while watching it, and I didn't expect it to be so meaningful as I discovered it to be when re- watching it now, after approx. 12 years since I saw it. This movie is building up on existential questions we all have asked ourselves at one point or another in our lives: Are we alone in this Universe? Is there a God? What is the purpose of our life? etc). As the movie progresses, the feeling of getting closer to answering those questions is getting stronger and stronger, until it reaches it's climax: the part where you'll find yourself just observing, full of curiosity and excitement. The ending has its own unique way of answering those questions. Given the fact that it tackles such controversial, hard, essential questions and problems, one would expect this movie to collapse in an annoying unsatisfying feeling at the end. Well, it doesn't. This movie is a true work of art. Brilliant!

    Carl Sagan is a hero of mine. I admit it. Him and Richard Feynman. If more people had them as role-models instead of sports-stars, actors and models the world would look a very different place, to the better. Sagan never took opposition to religion, he merely asked: if there is a creator, who created him? In this masterpiece he again leans towards that question with religion being portrayed by Matt M and science by Jodie Foster. Of course science is the main focus and i remember Sagan in his TV- series "Cosmos" often contemplating how a Non-Terrestial-Intelligence would contact us and that his conclusion was by mathematics, in this case prime numbers. This movie is great and has a message that speaks to many people: Have an open mind and be curious about the world and cosmos we live in, and that we are not alone in this universe. This movie is a lost gem in many ways, people these days just needs their quick-fix action-flick. That's sad.

    From the mind of astronomer Carl Sagan, and flawlessly directed by Robert Zemeckis, "Contact" tells the story of a young astronomer/scientist named Ellie Arroway, played to perfection by Jodie Foster, who discovers a message from outer space that may finally be proof of intelligent life in the universe. The message is mathematical in nature, but basically details blueprints for a vehicle intended to bring its occupant to the star Vega, from where the message is originating. Director Zemeckis is in familiar waters here, blending fiction seamlessly with reality; such as actual footage from press conferences with former president Bill Clinton, as well as cameos by a host of news personalities, all playing themselves. What Zemeckis started in "Forrest Gump" is refined and improved in "Contact", an unfairly underrated and under-appreciated parable about science, religion and the great gulf that separates them. In addition to Jodie Foster's superlative work, more outstanding performances from stars such as James Woods, Tom Skerritt and Matthew McConaughey round out a truly stellar cast, pun definitely intended. In the course of the story, the argument of "god" vs. science is brought up consistently, but Zemeckis wisely refrains from taking a side here, instead allowing the viewer to make their own decision on which "truth" is the real one. (On a personal note: I, myself, would be classified as a "non-believer" HOWEVER, I also subscribe to the practice of logic. In this case, the logical conclusion that the universe in and of itself MUST have had a "first cause", and as a result, something or someone HAD to have caused that first cause.) As the worldwide news of this incredible discovery spreads, and the device itself is constructed, we are consistently shown both sides of the debate, neither viewpoint canceling out the other. Perpetual questions are raised: Are we alone in the universe? If not, who or what are our neighbors? Where are we in terms of evolution in comparison to any other lifeforms that may or may not exist? These questions are explored, but the answers left ambiguously unanswered, leaving the viewer forced to come to their own conclusion, their own process of determining the truth. Just one more thing...the final thirty minutes or so of "Contact" provide Foster's uncovering of what may or may not be the answers she, and we too, all are seeking. And then, there is a scene, which I'll not spoil for you, that shows Foster's attaining closure with a loved one who initiated her path in life. If you have a human heart beating within you, and you've ever mourned or yearned for someone you've lost, this scene will have you in tears, just as it's done to me again and again... In the end, "Contact" urges us all to find our own answers to the burning questions we have in our minds. As a parable of society's perception of faith vs. fact, it is superlative. As a study of humanity and it's place in the universe, it simply is perfection. If you've not seen "Contact" before, you owe it to yourself to experience this at least once in your life. What a beautiful film.

    Jodi Foster makes this movie, with strong assists from Matthew McConaughey and Tom Skerritt. McConaughey does a good job with a difficult and contradictory character by trying to juxtapose the character's desire to believe in a generalist (philosophical definition) God with the humanist ethic of valuing the individual. Doesn't always work. Skerritt's character is more one-dimensional and so, so familiar for anyone who's every encountered one of these types in academia, the military or business hierarchies. Hard to see them as human and Skerritt does a bang-up job of portraying the type. But it's Foster's performance as Arroway that lights-up the screen. Jena Malone (young Ellie) needs to be mentioned here for her own stellar performance in setting the stage for Foster and making the transition believable. But once Foster appears, that's the ballgame. Even when plot elements break down (great script but it does breakdown when the contradictions overwhelm it), Foster's performance carries through. You could care less about the plot. And there are a lot of plot breakdowns, particularly in terms of the logistics of the Contact. First one: Vega never received coherent radio or TV transmissions from Earth - they would have dissipated before leaving the Solar System, let alone covering 25 light years. Secondly, the first thing any culture would do is establish its identity, the "Me Tarzan" thing. Then there's the Machine - schematics sent without any description of what, precisely, it does. Sell me a bridge. And then there's a whole host of other problems - if the Vegans had the technology to build such a machine, why not use it instead of beaming signals limited to the speed of light? Surely they would have the technology to identify Earth and do a spectrographic analysis of our atmosphere to see if it was compatible with theirs. And, assuming they could parse images out of those primitive TV signals, why not watch a while and then send a slightly more personal and focused message? But that's not what the movie's about and the suspension of disbelief covers most of those issues. The movie is really about the Wonder of the Universe and the point of the Contact is to emphasis that wonder, not watching alien home movies. So, as illogical as it is, it makes a lot more dramatic sense to portray the Contact as a great mystery sent to us for unraveling. This is where Malone and Foster's performances shine, projecting that sense of wonder with energy and passion from the first scene to the last, gluing your eyes to the screen. Personally, the only part I didn't buy was her brief sojourn at where-ever-it-was beachy kind of place where she met her father again and what the hell is this all about? I get it in dramatic and thematic terms but, for me, it grates like a bad dream sequence. Even at that, the movie recovers magnificently by focusing on the What Happened? issue after the capsule just kind of goes splat! when the Machine is turn on. Empirically, nothing - it just drops despite Arroway's passionate insistence she went Somewhere. While the Somewhere doesn't work for me as a Somewhere, it works better than a prosaic Welcome to Vegan, Earthling! sign would have so you take what you get. And I found the What Happened controversy surprising engaging as it led to the final scene, Foster sitting on the edge of a New Mexican cliff and seeing the Universe in a handful of soil. Blake, anyone? That is what Contact is all about, Emerson and Blake: seeing the Universe in a grain of sand and the Transcendent perception of its workings. Foster's performance is an elegant expression of that quest.

    Science vs Religion. I wouldn't want to get stuck in an elevator with either representative, but then again, the concept of one side having a small inkling of how the other thinks made for a life affirming journey for Dr. Ellie Arroway (played by the eternally adorable Jodi Foster). Visually adventurous and theoretically interesting, Contact succeeds ala Indiana Jones in adventure and truth seeking yet fails every time that Matthew McConaughey smirks for the camera as casting clearly opted for box office over suspicion of disbelief. But it doesn't take away from the search for the truth, only reminds you that the powers that be that make movies that are marketed just get out of their own way. Thumbs up to James Woods governmental response the the message from the sky!

    I have seen this movie a number of times and I watched it again last night on TV. I do not understand how anyone who could call this movie "bad." The story is not perfect but even with its faults, this is the type of movie which I can watch over and over. Carl Sagan is an amazing Science Fiction writer. And this movie is a lasting tribute. The performances are superb. Jodie Foster is believable as a driven female scientist who transitions from skeptic to true believer in life beyond what is know to us. Th story telling, cinematography and acting all make this film a classic. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who like science fiction,superb story telling and great acting.

    This movie is based on a novel bearing the same name which is Carl Edward Sagan's only work of fiction that he ever wrote. Carl Sagan is one of my heroes largely because of his Peabody award-winning Cosmos series. Sagan was willing to envision civilizations far more advanced than we are but reused to ignore the laws of physics when writing his novel Contact. Sagan had a friend at Cal-tech named Kip Throne who is a theoretical physicist who worked on wormholes and the nature of space and time whom consulted him on Contact. This movie was the #1 best astronomy movie according to Astronomy Magazine because it was a realistic depiction of contact with an alien civilization. Contact was very well written and deep, and I can totally relate to this movie. My favorite part was when Ellie went in the dodecahedron pod on that machine and traveled through wormholes and saw stars and galaxies and landed on a beach on a planet near the center of our galaxy where see saw an apparition of her father. This movie is currently my #2 favorite only second to Avatar and is a great homage to astronomy.

    Science vs Religion. I wouldn't want to get stuck in an elevator with either representative, but then again, the concept of one side having a small inkling of how the other thinks made for a life affirming journey for Dr. Ellie Arroway (played by the eternally adorable Jodi Foster). Visually adventurous and theoretically interesting, Contact succeeds ala Indiana Jones in adventure and truth seeking yet fails every time that Matthew McConaughey smirks for the camera as casting clearly opted for box office over suspicion of disbelief. But it doesn't take away from the search for the truth, only reminds you that the powers that be that make movies that are marketed just get out of their own way. Thumbs up to James Woods governmental response the the message from the sky!

    I have seen this movie a number of times and I watched it again last night on TV. I do not understand how anyone who could call this movie "bad." The story is not perfect but even with its faults, this is the type of movie which I can watch over and over. Carl Sagan is an amazing Science Fiction writer. And this movie is a lasting tribute. The performances are superb. Jodie Foster is believable as a driven female scientist who transitions from skeptic to true believer in life beyond what is know to us. Th story telling, cinematography and acting all make this film a classic. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who like science fiction,superb story telling and great acting.

    This movie is based on a novel bearing the same name which is Carl Edward Sagan's only work of fiction that he ever wrote. Carl Sagan is one of my heroes largely because of his Peabody award-winning Cosmos series. Sagan was willing to envision civilizations far more advanced than we are but reused to ignore the laws of physics when writing his novel Contact. Sagan had a friend at Cal-tech named Kip Throne who is a theoretical physicist who worked on wormholes and the nature of space and time whom consulted him on Contact. This movie was the #1 best astronomy movie according to Astronomy Magazine because it was a realistic depiction of contact with an alien civilization. Contact was very well written and deep, and I can totally relate to this movie. My favorite part was when Ellie went in the dodecahedron pod on that machine and traveled through wormholes and saw stars and galaxies and landed on a beach on a planet near the center of our galaxy where see saw an apparition of her father. This movie is currently my #2 favorite only second to Avatar and is a great homage to astronomy.

    Contact is an incredible movie that touches upon the intricate subject of both science and religion as well as their somewhat opposing values and beliefs. This notion is clearly depicted in the form of human relationship, particularly speaking, the relationship between Eleanor Arroway and Palmor Joss, a scientist and a priest. Their contrasting beliefs and ideologies together with their shared love for each other shows not only the difference between science and religion but also their similarities. Both Jodie Foster and Matthew McConaughey did a brilliant job at playing their roles. Overall, it was a delightful experience to watch a fictional story of the event of alien contact. One complaint though, on my part, is that most of the antagonistic elements of the movie such as Drumlin or Kitz, are all depicted as ignorant and arrogant power figures that do nothing more than annoy and constrain the main character, which seems quite stupid in all honesty. In a global effort to make contact with an alien civilization, would such people really go as far as take advantage of an honest and talented scientist, whose discovery has literally altered the course of history, simply for the reason of personal gain? All Drumlin did was finish Arroway's sentences and steal her glory while pretending to be innocent. Same goes for Kitz, all he did was criticize when everything seemed like it went to toilet. These details might seem minor but I feel like they were a bit exaggerated really. But they are what they are, only minor annoyances, doesn't in any way affect the great story. 7.5/10 would watch again.

    I'm kind of sciencefiction fanatic but for some reason Contact never attracted me. But after hearing some OK stories I decided to view it after all this time it was released. Beforehand I knew it was about mankind making contact with an alien source and the whole builtup to that happening was executed very good. The whole deciphering part of the signal felt a bit like an Indiana Jones adventure. Very smart writing. What I didn't like at all was that I felt the director was trying to please both the church goers and scientists. I got no clue at all why a huge chunk of the story was reserved for a science vs religion debate. What was the point? And to please the atheists/scientist a fundamental Christian terrorist was thrown in. Like he wanted to say "hey you can't blame me that I must be sponsored by the church! I wrote a Christian terrorist in the story!" It all felt really misplaced for me. Like a scene from a different movie. They could have written out the whole Matthew McConaughey part and it would be a better movie. His role was just stupid. For a scifi geek the whole building of the wormhole-portal machine was just great. And it got even better when the whole travelling part began. After watching the intro of the movie where we saw the planet Earth zooming out to our Galaxy, then clusters and then the whole Universe I was hoping that something would happen again and it did. With wormhole travelling. It really felt like a roller-coaster ride. The actual arrival on the alien planet felt a bit disappointing. The alien who dressed up as her dad was lame. Maybe it was original then but I just wanted to see the imagination of what an alien lifeform would look like according to the director. So that was disappointing. So if the story would be all about Jody Fosters ambition without the pointless religion crap and the love affair with Matthew McConaughey I would have given it an 8 probably. Now a 6 but still a good watch.

    This movie pretends to be intelligent but is not. It is full of plot and factual holes. There are too numerous so I will just address the most glaring ones. First, the most glaring 'factual' hole: the 'first public TV broadcast of 1936 cannot possibly have reached Vega and responded to by the time-frame the movie is set: as of now the signal has barely entered the outer-limits of the solar system!!! Now the most glaring plot hole that seems to have so far escaped any mention: the machine in Hokkaido is NOT one time use only machine--why didn't anybody after the Jody Foster character get on the machine and verify what she said was indeed what actually happened? Was the damage to the chair assembly (caused by the character's getting off to retrieve the necklace)too severe to be repaired???? Come on, it does not make sense.

    I remember I saw this movie when I was little and I liked it a lot. However, now I was convinced the reason I had liked it so much was the excitement and curiosity it had stirred in me while watching it, and I didn't expect it to be so meaningful as I discovered it to be when re- watching it now, after approx. 12 years since I saw it. This movie is building up on existential questions we all have asked ourselves at one point or another in our lives: Are we alone in this Universe? Is there a God? What is the purpose of our life? etc). As the movie progresses, the feeling of getting closer to answering those questions is getting stronger and stronger, until it reaches it's climax: the part where you'll find yourself just observing, full of curiosity and excitement. The ending has its own unique way of answering those questions. Given the fact that it tackles such controversial, hard, essential questions and problems, one would expect this movie to collapse in an annoying unsatisfying feeling at the end. Well, it doesn't. This movie is a true work of art. Brilliant!

    Carl Sagan is a hero of mine. I admit it. Him and Richard Feynman. If more people had them as role-models instead of sports-stars, actors and models the world would look a very different place, to the better. Sagan never took opposition to religion, he merely asked: if there is a creator, who created him? In this masterpiece he again leans towards that question with religion being portrayed by Matt M and science by Jodie Foster. Of course science is the main focus and i remember Sagan in his TV- series "Cosmos" often contemplating how a Non-Terrestial-Intelligence would contact us and that his conclusion was by mathematics, in this case prime numbers. This movie is great and has a message that speaks to many people: Have an open mind and be curious about the world and cosmos we live in, and that we are not alone in this universe. This movie is a lost gem in many ways, people these days just needs their quick-fix action-flick. That's sad.

    From the mind of astronomer Carl Sagan, and flawlessly directed by Robert Zemeckis, "Contact" tells the story of a young astronomer/scientist named Ellie Arroway, played to perfection by Jodie Foster, who discovers a message from outer space that may finally be proof of intelligent life in the universe. The message is mathematical in nature, but basically details blueprints for a vehicle intended to bring its occupant to the star Vega, from where the message is originating. Director Zemeckis is in familiar waters here, blending fiction seamlessly with reality; such as actual footage from press conferences with former president Bill Clinton, as well as cameos by a host of news personalities, all playing themselves. What Zemeckis started in "Forrest Gump" is refined and improved in "Contact", an unfairly underrated and under-appreciated parable about science, religion and the great gulf that separates them. In addition to Jodie Foster's superlative work, more outstanding performances from stars such as James Woods, Tom Skerritt and Matthew McConaughey round out a truly stellar cast, pun definitely intended. In the course of the story, the argument of "god" vs. science is brought up consistently, but Zemeckis wisely refrains from taking a side here, instead allowing the viewer to make their own decision on which "truth" is the real one. (On a personal note: I, myself, would be classified as a "non-believer" HOWEVER, I also subscribe to the practice of logic. In this case, the logical conclusion that the universe in and of itself MUST have had a "first cause", and as a result, something or someone HAD to have caused that first cause.) As the worldwide news of this incredible discovery spreads, and the device itself is constructed, we are consistently shown both sides of the debate, neither viewpoint canceling out the other. Perpetual questions are raised: Are we alone in the universe? If not, who or what are our neighbors? Where are we in terms of evolution in comparison to any other lifeforms that may or may not exist? These questions are explored, but the answers left ambiguously unanswered, leaving the viewer forced to come to their own conclusion, their own process of determining the truth. Just one more thing...the final thirty minutes or so of "Contact" provide Foster's uncovering of what may or may not be the answers she, and we too, all are seeking. And then, there is a scene, which I'll not spoil for you, that shows Foster's attaining closure with a loved one who initiated her path in life. If you have a human heart beating within you, and you've ever mourned or yearned for someone you've lost, this scene will have you in tears, just as it's done to me again and again... In the end, "Contact" urges us all to find our own answers to the burning questions we have in our minds. As a parable of society's perception of faith vs. fact, it is superlative. As a study of humanity and it's place in the universe, it simply is perfection. If you've not seen "Contact" before, you owe it to yourself to experience this at least once in your life. What a beautiful film.

    Jodi Foster makes this movie, with strong assists from Matthew McConaughey and Tom Skerritt. McConaughey does a good job with a difficult and contradictory character by trying to juxtapose the character's desire to believe in a generalist (philosophical definition) God with the humanist ethic of valuing the individual. Doesn't always work. Skerritt's character is more one-dimensional and so, so familiar for anyone who's every encountered one of these types in academia, the military or business hierarchies. Hard to see them as human and Skerritt does a bang-up job of portraying the type. But it's Foster's performance as Arroway that lights-up the screen. Jena Malone (young Ellie) needs to be mentioned here for her own stellar performance in setting the stage for Foster and making the transition believable. But once Foster appears, that's the ballgame. Even when plot elements break down (great script but it does breakdown when the contradictions overwhelm it), Foster's performance carries through. You could care less about the plot. And there are a lot of plot breakdowns, particularly in terms of the logistics of the Contact. First one: Vega never received coherent radio or TV transmissions from Earth - they would have dissipated before leaving the Solar System, let alone covering 25 light years. Secondly, the first thing any culture would do is establish its identity, the "Me Tarzan" thing. Then there's the Machine - schematics sent without any description of what, precisely, it does. Sell me a bridge. And then there's a whole host of other problems - if the Vegans had the technology to build such a machine, why not use it instead of beaming signals limited to the speed of light? Surely they would have the technology to identify Earth and do a spectrographic analysis of our atmosphere to see if it was compatible with theirs. And, assuming they could parse images out of those primitive TV signals, why not watch a while and then send a slightly more personal and focused message? But that's not what the movie's about and the suspension of disbelief covers most of those issues. The movie is really about the Wonder of the Universe and the point of the Contact is to emphasis that wonder, not watching alien home movies. So, as illogical as it is, it makes a lot more dramatic sense to portray the Contact as a great mystery sent to us for unraveling. This is where Malone and Foster's performances shine, projecting that sense of wonder with energy and passion from the first scene to the last, gluing your eyes to the screen. Personally, the only part I didn't buy was her brief sojourn at where-ever-it-was beachy kind of place where she met her father again and what the hell is this all about? I get it in dramatic and thematic terms but, for me, it grates like a bad dream sequence. Even at that, the movie recovers magnificently by focusing on the What Happened? issue after the capsule just kind of goes splat! when the Machine is turn on. Empirically, nothing - it just drops despite Arroway's passionate insistence she went Somewhere. While the Somewhere doesn't work for me as a Somewhere, it works better than a prosaic Welcome to Vegan, Earthling! sign would have so you take what you get. And I found the What Happened controversy surprising engaging as it led to the final scene, Foster sitting on the edge of a New Mexican cliff and seeing the Universe in a handful of soil. Blake, anyone? That is what Contact is all about, Emerson and Blake: seeing the Universe in a grain of sand and the Transcendent perception of its workings. Foster's performance is an elegant expression of that quest.
