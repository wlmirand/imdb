  On a US nuclear missile sub, a young first officer stages a mutiny to prevent his trigger happy captain from launching his missiles before confirming his orders to do so.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  When some Russian rebels takes control of some ICBM's, the Americans mobilize. Among the vessels sent is the nuclear sub, the Alabama. But before they leave they need a new X.O. and among the choices is Commander Hunter, who hasn't seen much action. But the ship's Captain, Ramsey OK's him. While on the way, there was an incident and Hunter disagreed with how Ramsey handled it, it's evident that Ramsey doesn't think much of Hunter because Hunter was college educated while Ramsey worked his way up. They're given orders to attack but when they were in the process of receiving another order, the ship's communications were damaged, so the entire message was not received. Ramsey decides to continue with their previous order while Hunter wants to reestablish contact first. That's when the two men butt heads that ends with Hunter relieving Ramsey. Later when some men die, some of the officers feel that Hunter is not up to the task so they team up to retake control. But Hunter has taken ...

    When rebellious Russians seize control of their country's nuclear missiles, the fate of the entire free world hangs in the balance. To take care of the matter, the United States depends on a submarine in the Mediterranean Sea. The sub's captain is, according to the film's opening, one of the three most powerful men in the world (listed after the leaders of Russia and the USA). The "Alabama" is led my gun-ho veteran Gene Hackman (as Frank Ramsey). He has just hired cautious newcomer Denzel Washington (as Ron Hunter) as commander. They share an affection for horses, but do not agree on war action... The big problem occurs when Mr. Hackman and Mr. Washington interpret an "Emergency Action Message" differently. Due to a power failure, the message arrives incomplete. Hackman takes it as an order to launch a preemptive nuclear attack on Russia. Washington believes they should wait for clarity. Battle lines are drawn as the captain and commander are unable to agree... "Crimson Tide" is well-acted and nicely directed (by Tony Scott), but there is little logic or suspense. From the introduction of the co-stars, we know who is correct. Also, it's a silly movie. Washington uses pop culture to win friends and influence the crew. He lets Danny Nucci (as Rivetti) know who drew the best "Silver Surfer" and plays "Star Trek" with Lillo Brancato (as Vossler). ***** Crimson Tide (5/12/95) Tony Scott ~ Denzel Washington, Gene Hackman, George Dzundza, Viggo Mortensen

    There is a lot of ritual in the American military movies from the 90's. More than usual, that is. Crimson Tide is the story of a nuclear crisis when a crippled US submarine receives orders to fire nuclear missiles, then another partial message just before communications fail. The hardass captain (Hackman, of course) is countered in his desire to obey the launch order by the intellectual XO, played by Denzel Washington. And you have ritual in this as well: the speech before submarine launch, the wooden drills that have to happen "just so" with specific phrases and actions to reassure people they are doing the right thing. It's akin to religion and, by the very nature of the film, it makes you understand it was designed as such, transforming people into unthinking and uncaring machines. In truth, there isn't much to this movie in terms of story. The nuclear scenario is not really believable while the individual ideas in the film are simple and few. What makes the whole thing stand out is the great cast and their performance. There is some food for thought, though, because as far as the plot went, they really did receive a nuclear launch order when in all appearance, there was no need for one. That they recanted afterwards is of no relevance and perhaps a movie about that side of the story would be very interesting. Also, the ending shows that, as closed societies and fraternities often do, when a failure in their process or beliefs is found, it is quickly hidden under empty words and dirty bribes. Because even if they try to show the integrity of Hackman's character, the ending of the movie was just that: a bribe for a cover-up. As a conclusion, it is a classic film already, something that is worth watching for the sake of remembering the names of the actors in social situations alone, as James Gandolfini's character proves at the beginning of the film, and it also makes one think, if one is willing. What I found chilling is the joyful exuberance of the submarine troops when destroying the Russian one or the fanatic desire for some to follow the launch order. As Sting said, Russians love their children, too. So often in such movies, this element is completely ignored. That is what starts wars.

    Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer's 1995 film production of "Crimson Tide" has a good Submarine Dramatization Action/Thriller plot that features some intense action scenes, great cast, & excellent dialogue. The director, who made this film was Ridley Scott's younger brother Tony Scott. The film was released on May 12, 1995. The plot starts off with a news report that involves Russian rebels loyal to Vladimir Radchenko, an ultra nationalist, have hijacked a nuclear missile installation and are threatening nuclear war if either the American or Russian governments attempt to confront him. A U.S. Navy nuclear submarine, USS Alabama (SSBN-731), is assigned a mission, to be available to launch its missiles in a preemptive strike if Radchenko attempts to fuel his missiles. "The incredible Gene Hackman" portrays Captain Frank Ramsey, who is the commanding officer of USS Alabama. Before they officially start the mission, they need to hire a new X.O. and the choice that they picked is Lieutenant Commander Ron Hunter portrayed by Denzel Washington. Hunter is an expert in military history but, no combat experience. While on the way, there was an incident and Hunter had a disagreement with how Ramsey handled the plan, it's evident that Ramsey doesn't think too much of Hunter because he was college educated while Ramsey worked his way up. They're given strict commands to attack but when they were in the process of receiving another order, the ship's communications were damaged, so the whole message was not responded. Ramsey made a decision to continue with their previous order while Hunter wants to re-establish contact first. That's when the two men butt heads that ends with Hunter relieving Ramsey. Later when some men die, some of the officers feel that Hunter is not up to be in charge so they partner up to re-command control. But Hunter has taken precautions. The two then-semi-famous actors Viggo Mortensen (6 years before he portrayed the role as Aragon from The Lord of the rings trilogy) and James Gandolfini (4 years before he portrayed Italian-American crime boss Tony Soprano from the HBO crime series The Sopranos) both portrayed two supporting characters deputy Peter "Weps" Ince & Bobby Dougherty. Speaking of which, there is a cool moment in movie, when Weps, Bobby, and the rest of the crew on the bus to the submarine port were talking about old submarine movies like "The Enemy below" (1957) and "Run Silent Run Deep "(1958).They were also asking trivia question about Submarine movies each other: Weps asked Bobby who played the commander from Run Silent, Run Deep and then, Bobby answered "Cary Grant". That answer is actually wrong , it wasn't Cary Grant it was Clark Gable a.k.a The King of Hollywood , who portrayed the submarine commander from Run Silent, Run Deep. Both The Enemy Below and Run Silent, Run Deep of course made the same connection of the movie due to the same submarine film genre of those two films as they were mentioned in the film that is of course also Submarine film and that's why I find this moment of the movie to be cool. One of the deputies of the submarine, Bobby needs a little more character development. There is a realization that Bobby doesn't really have a lot of dialogue of the film but, I still think that he could be entertaining character at times. Jimmy's New Jersey accent makes his character is the main reason that make his character entertaining in the film. 36 year old James Gandolfini was still portraying supporting movie roles at the time he started in this movie. Bobby was the main deputy disagrees on Hunter taking over the submarine. I find Hans Zimmer's film score in the action scenes of the film to be very thrilling. The sounds from the orchestra, choir and synthesizer makes the film score thrilling. Hans Zimmer won a Grammy award of this film score in 1996.This film score is one of Hans Zimmer's personal favorites along with The Lion King and Gladiator. Both Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman acted out on their lead characters really well. The way that they were both taking command of submarine was serious in a intensive way. The arguments about their disagreements that they had, made it intensively serious. I highly recommend that movie for people in general and especially people, who are into submarine movies like "Das Boot". I find the movie to be "Thrilling. I give a 3 out of 4 stars.

    World War III is about to break out in the Tony Scott's movie 'Crimson Tide', when political turmoil in Russia has caused worries in United States when Russia ultra-nationalists threaten to launch nuclear missiles at them. The movie focuses on the military mission of the USS Alabama, a nuclear submarine whom duty is to launch missions back into Russia if war breaks out. The submarine is split in conflicting opinions and wills between the seasoned commanding officer Captain Frank Ramsey (Gene Hackman) and the new executive officer Lt. Ron Hunter (Denzel Washington) on the interpretations of an order to launch their missiles. In the nuclear world, the true enemy is war itself. The movie has this 'Mutiny of the Bounty' feel to it, as the audience is swept into a very plausible scenario between Hunter's more analytical, cautious approach, as opposed to Ramsey's more impulsive and intuitive approach to the mission. Great acting from both of them. I love the exchange between Hackman and Washington on the topic of Lipizzaner horses and Von Clausewitz' view of war. Indeed, all the actors have their moments to shine, including Viggo Mortensen, James Gandolfini and an excellent George Dzundza. The movie is a great suspense with an amazing music score by Hans Zimmer. The heavy use of synthesizers in place of traditional orchestral instruments sound chilling like an old Gothic church's choirs. The well-known naval hymn, "Eternal Father, Strong to Save" is given an new spin into it. It's great to note that Harry Gregson-Williams help with the bass thumbing. Great to hear on large speakers the score. The movie has excellent visuals for a smart and tense film. Now to the faults of the film, while Richard Hendrick wrote the novel, he probably knew little about submarines as a lot of the real life Navy's submariners didn't like the film. The movie had many breaches of naval protocols that it became too unrealizable to them. Example are such like Supply Officers are restricted, and cannot be put into a position to where they could take command. They don't have the training to do so. The real life Navy regulations would have Hunter disciplined for insubordination and replaced with another XO no matter what happen on the boat. Still, I like the submarine lingoes, even if I didn't understand them. Both Washington and Hackman play stereotypical roles to the point, it's seem more about a race issue between Black VS White, than an issue about launching nuclear weapons. Who brings up semi-racism likes comments like what color the most trained horse are? Was the racial subtext, necessary? The way, Denzel Washington talks to his subordinates as if they are children is a bit odd. I wouldn't have thought for once a Star Trek or a Silver Surfer reference was going to be in this type of film. Don't get me wrong, it's cool to hear it, but I would love for the movie in those scenes to be taking more serious. What part of the Navy allows a dog on submarine unless it's a K9 unit? Even if you're the captain, I doubt you can bring a dog to pee everywhere. Forget about Tide. Even Clorox could not clean up that mistake. Overall: Crimson Tide is a great movie. Worth watching.

    Prior to Tony Scott's recent suicide, I hadn't seen most of his movies. But now I've seen "Crimson Tide". This portrays tension aboard a nuclear submarine when the hot-headed captain (Gene Hackman) wants to go ahead with a launch while the restrained executive officer (Denzel Washington) wants to wait for another signal. I didn't think that it was a great movie, but the context of rebel forces in Russia threatening to launch nukes brings up the issue of how secure weapons of mass destruction anywhere are, combined with the risk that a trigger-happy might ignore an incomplete message and decide to launch weapons. The point is, who can truly be considered sane in a completely insane situation? Like I said, it's not any kind of masterpiece, but still worth seeing. Great tension between Hackman and Washington. Appearing in early roles are James Gandolfini, Steve Zahn, Ryan Philippe and Daniel Von Bargen.

    First off, id like to say that if you know nothing about the military (or you hate it) you will like this movie. If you know anything about submariners, its an absolute joke. NO WAY ANY OF THIS WOULD EVER GO ON IN A NUCLEAR SUB! I was never in the military myself but I have many friends who were and I can tell you that if you bring up this movie around them they will go on for hours about how silly and contrived all the scenes in the movie are. Denzel was in his usual semi-racist (but not too racist) role. Not to mention Gene Hackman playing his usual role of the "conservative" American who is nothing more than the worst human being imaginable. Arrogant, cocky, and of course, stubborn as a mule. Has anyone else noticed that he almost always plays the same character, just different situations? Bottom line is this movie is nothing more than Hollywood liberal propaganda, using the "manly-man" Gene Hackman as their fall guy for the stereotypical evil conservative who just needs to be re-educated (and usually is) in how to be a good little socialist. If you want to see a good submarine movie, see "The hunt for Red October". Otherwise, avoid this tired piece of liberal propaganda.

    This movie shows us a few men in a submarine.They have a mission there, since there is a risk of a nuclear war started by a crazy Russian man.Two men are fighting their own personal war down there.Crimson Tide (1995) is directed by Tony Scott.Just a little time ago we heard some tragic news that this great Hollywood director has killed himself at the age of 68.One can ask whether his best work had already been done, or would it have been yet to come.Denzel Washington, who worked with Tony in five films (this being the first one), is terrific as Lt. Commander Ron Hunter.What a thrill it is to watch Gene Hackman as Captain Frank Ramsey and the battle between his and Denzel's character.Matt Craven is great as Lt. Roy Zimmer.George Dzundza is brilliant as Chief of the Boat.Viggo Mortensen is superb as Lt. Peter Ince.James Gandolfini does great work as Lt. Bobby Dougherty.Rocky Carroll plays Lt. Darik Westergard.Danny Nucci is Petty Officer Danny Rivetti.Rick Schroder plays Lt. Paul Hellerman.Steve Zahn is William Barnes.Scott Grimes is seen as Petty Officer Hilaire.Ryan Phillippe is seen as Seaman Grattam.Jason Robards is in an uncredited role playing Rear Admiral Anderson.This is a great submarine movie.You can practically feel the tension they're feeling down there.Tony Scott, you did a great job!

    Crimson Tide is a submarine film directed by the late Tony Scott that stars Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington. It takes place during a period of political turmoil in the Russian Federation, in which ultra-nationalists threaten to launch nuclear missiles at the United States and Japan. It focuses on a clash of wills between the seasoned commanding officer (Gene Hackman) and the new executive officer (Denzel Washington) of a nuclear missile submarine, arising from conflicting interpretations of an order to launch their missiles. The film takes place during a period of instability in post-Soviet Russia. Units of the Russian military loyal to Radchenko, an ultra-nationalist, have taken control of a nuclear missile installation and are threatening nuclear war if either the American or the Russian government attempts to confront him. The United States nuclear strategic missile submarine USS Alabama is assigned a patrol mission, to be available to launch its missiles in a preemptive strike if Radchenko attempts to fuel the missiles his men have captured. Captain Frank Ramsey is the commanding officer of the sub, and one of the few commanders left in the Navy with any combat experience. He chooses as his new executive officer (XO) Lieutenant Commander Ron Hunter, who has an extensive education in military history and tactics, but no combat experience. During their initial days at sea, tensions between Ramsey and Hunter become apparent due to a clash of personalities: Hunter's more analytical, cautious approach towards his mission and the men, as opposed to Ramsey's more impulsive and intuitive approach. The Alabama eventually receives an Emergency Action Message from the National Command Authority, ordering the launch of ten of its SLBM missiles on the Russian nuclear installation, based on satellite information that the Russians' missiles are being fueled. Before the Alabama can launch, a second message arrives but is cut off by the attack of a Russian submarine friendly to Radchenko. The radio is damaged in the attack and is unable to decode the second message. With the last confirmed order being to launch, Captain Ramsey decides to proceed with the launch. Hunter refuses to concur as is procedurally required to launch, because he believes the partial second message may be a retraction. Hunter argues that the Alabama is not the only American submarine in the area, and if the order was not retracted, other submarines will launch their missiles. Ramsey argues that attack submarines may have destroyed any other American submarines and that they can't rely on someone else to carry out the order for them. Boasting taut, high energy thrills and some cracking dialogue courtesy of an uncredited Quentin Tarantino, Crimson Tide finds the late director Tony Scott near the top of his action game.It is a rare kind of war movie that not only thrills people while they're watching it, but invites them to leave the theater actually discussing the issues.And last but not the least,the performances in the film were top-notch. This is highly recommended for anyone who loves good movies.

    Crimson Tide is a must-see for anyone who likes action combined with drama or are big fans of A-list actors. Going into this movie, I expected something along the lines of The Hunt for the Red October. But what I got is a better film. This movie portrays possible real-life scenarios on whether or not submarine commanders should launch nuclear weapons. This is about a naval submarine heading to Russia to launch nuclear weapons on them. But after the radio transmission failed in the middle of the report, the captain and XO go out on each other determining what will be best thing for them to do. The acting is phenomenal. Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington are brand name actors who never do anything wrong. They are marvelous here as the captains. Overall, this is not like most thrillers. This one has a great build-up and a great ending. Also, I must note the score by Hans Zimmer. It is worth listening too. I rate this film 9/10.

    "Crimson Tide" is a 1995 film Starring Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman. The Tony Scott film involves a first officer (Washington) on a nuclear submarine who clashes with his captain (Hackman) over whether or not they have enough information to perform a first strike on a volatile Russia. As far as, Tony Scott films go, they're sort of hit or miss. I loved "Man On Fire" and "Unstoppable." However, movies like "Deja Vu" and "The Taking Of Pelham 123" are just sort of "meh" for me. This is partly because Mr. Scott made a very strange transition midway through his career. He went from using a really clean and traditional camera movement (as in "Top Gun," "True Romance," and "Crimson Tide") to using this really frenetic and trippy camera style (as in "Deja Vu," "Man On Fire," and "Unstoppable"). Sometimes the latter works, sometimes it doesn't, but one thing that usually has stayed amazingly consistent throughout Tony Scott's career is a brilliant lead performance from Denzel Washington. Tony Scott and Denzel Washington have collaborated together five times, and they've crafted some amazing stuff. "Crimson Tide" is no different here - Denzel sails through this movie with an utterly incredible finesse. However, while Denzel's performance is a force to be reckoned with, the best performance in this film is from none other than Popeye Doyle himself; Mr. Gene Hackman. His portrayal of Captain Frank Ramsey is one of the most menacing performances I've seen him give in a long while. Hackman owns this ship. In terms of directing, this movie in my opinion had everything "The Hunt For Red October" had, yet there was just a tad more. While "The Hunt For Red October" filmed it's underwater combat scenes using trick photography and models in midair, "Crimson Tide" actually shot their model ships underwater and utilized practical special effects on them regularly. While "The Hunt For Red October" had a brilliant score by Basil Poledouris, "Crimson Tide". . .had Hans Zimmer. Finally, while "The Hunt For Red October"'s plot was very interesting and definitely worth watching, "Crimson Tide" managed to be one of the most intense filmgoing experiences for me in a very long time - the fear of a nuclear holocaust is hammered into your head at an almost unsettling degree. White-knuckle film? You don't know the meaning of the term. "Crimson Tide" is an unbelievable film that I will not soon forget.

Hunter is an expert in military history but, no combat experience. While on the way, there was an incident and Hunter had a disagreement with how Ramsey handled the plan, it's evident that Ramsey doesn't think too much of Hunter because he was college educated while Ramsey worked his way up. They're given strict commands to attack but when they were in the process of receiving another order, the ship's communications were damaged, so the whole message was not responded. Ramsey made a decision to continue with their previous order while Hunter wants to re-establish contact first. That's when the two men butt heads that ends with Hunter relieving Ramsey. Later when some men die, some of the officers feel that Hunter is not up to be in charge so they partner up to re-command control. But Hunter has taken precautions. The two then-semi-famous actors Viggo Mortensen (6 years before he portrayed the role as Aragon from The Lord of the rings trilogy) and James Gandolfini (4 years before he portrayed Italian-American crime boss Tony Soprano from the HBO crime series The Sopranos) both portrayed two supporting characters deputy Peter "Weps" Ince & Bobby Dougherty. Speaking of which, there is a cool moment in movie, when Weps, Bobby, and the rest of the crew on the bus to the submarine port were talking about old submarine movies like "The Enemy below" (1957) and "Run Silent Run Deep "(1958).They were also asking trivia question about Submarine movies each other: Weps asked Bobby who played the commander from Run Silent, Run Deep and then, Bobby answered "Cary Grant". That answer is actually wrong , it wasn't Cary Grant it was Clark Gable a.k.a The King of Hollywood , who portrayed the submarine commander from Run Silent, Run Deep. Both The Enemy Below and Run Silent, Run Deep of course made the same connection of the movie due to the same submarine film genre of those two films as they were mentioned in the film that is of course also Submarine film and that's why I find this moment of the movie to be cool. One of the deputies of the submarine, Bobby needs a little more character development. There is a realization that Bobby doesn't really have a lot of dialogue of the film but, I still think that he could be entertaining character at times. Jimmy's New Jersey accent makes his character is the main reason that make his character entertaining in the film. 36 year old James Gandolfini was still portraying supporting movie roles at the time he started in this movie. Bobby was the main deputy disagrees on Hunter taking over the submarine. I find Hans Zimmer's film score in the action scenes of the film to be very thrilling. The sounds from the orchestra, choir and synthesizer makes the film score thrilling. Hans Zimmer won a Grammy award of this film score in 1996.This film score is one of Hans Zimmer's personal favorites along with The Lion King and Gladiator. Both Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman acted out on their lead characters really well. The way that they were both taking command of submarine was serious in a intensive way. The arguments about their disagreements that they had, made it intensively serious. I highly recommend that movie for people in general and especially people, who are into submarine movies like "Das Boot". I find the movie to be "Thrilling. I give a 3 out of 4 stars.

    World War III is about to break out in the Tony Scott's movie 'Crimson Tide', when political turmoil in Russia has caused worries in United States when Russia ultra-nationalists threaten to launch nuclear missiles at them. The movie focuses on the military mission of the USS Alabama, a nuclear submarine whom duty is to launch missions back into Russia if war breaks out. The submarine is split in conflicting opinions and wills between the seasoned commanding officer Captain Frank Ramsey (Gene Hackman) and the new executive officer Lt. Ron Hunter (Denzel Washington) on the interpretations of an order to launch their missiles. In the nuclear world, the true enemy is war itself. The movie has this 'Mutiny of the Bounty' feel to it, as the audience is swept into a very plausible scenario between Hunter's more analytical, cautious approach, as opposed to Ramsey's more impulsive and intuitive approach to the mission. Great acting from both of them. I love the exchange between Hackman and Washington on the topic of Lipizzaner horses and Von Clausewitz' view of war. Indeed, all the actors have their moments to shine, including Viggo Mortensen, James Gandolfini and an excellent George Dzundza. The movie is a great suspense with an amazing music score by Hans Zimmer. The heavy use of synthesizers in place of traditional orchestral instruments sound chilling like an old Gothic church's choirs. The well-known naval hymn, "Eternal Father, Strong to Save" is given an new spin into it. It's great to note that Harry Gregson-Williams help with the bass thumbing. Great to hear on large speakers the score. The movie has excellent visuals for a smart and tense film. Now to the faults of the film, while Richard Hendrick wrote the novel, he probably knew little about submarines as a lot of the real life Navy's submariners didn't like the film. The movie had many breaches of naval protocols that it became too unrealizable to them. Example are such like Supply Officers are restricted, and cannot be put into a position to where they could take command. They don't have the training to do so. The real life Navy regulations would have Hunter disciplined for insubordination and replaced with another XO no matter what happen on the boat. Still, I like the submarine lingoes, even if I didn't understand them. Both Washington and Hackman play stereotypical roles to the point, it's seem more about a race issue between Black VS White, than an issue about launching nuclear weapons. Who brings up semi-racism likes comments like what color the most trained horse are? Was the racial subtext, necessary? The way, Denzel Washington talks to his subordinates as if they are children is a bit odd. I wouldn't have thought for once a Star Trek or a Silver Surfer reference was going to be in this type of film. Don't get me wrong, it's cool to hear it, but I would love for the movie in those scenes to be taking more serious. What part of the Navy allows a dog on submarine unless it's a K9 unit? Even if you're the captain, I doubt you can bring a dog to pee everywhere. Forget about Tide. Even Clorox could not clean up that mistake. Overall: Crimson Tide is a great movie. Worth watching.

    Prior to Tony Scott's recent suicide, I hadn't seen most of his movies. But now I've seen "Crimson Tide". This portrays tension aboard a nuclear submarine when the hot-headed captain (Gene Hackman) wants to go ahead with a launch while the restrained executive officer (Denzel Washington) wants to wait for another signal. I didn't think that it was a great movie, but the context of rebel forces in Russia threatening to launch nukes brings up the issue of how secure weapons of mass destruction anywhere are, combined with the risk that a trigger-happy might ignore an incomplete message and decide to launch weapons. The point is, who can truly be considered sane in a completely insane situation? Like I said, it's not any kind of masterpiece, but still worth seeing. Great tension between Hackman and Washington. Appearing in early roles are James Gandolfini, Steve Zahn, Ryan Philippe and Daniel Von Bargen.

    First off, id like to say that if you know nothing about the military (or you hate it) you will like this movie. If you know anything about submariners, its an absolute joke. NO WAY ANY OF THIS WOULD EVER GO ON IN A NUCLEAR SUB! I was never in the military myself but I have many friends who were and I can tell you that if you bring up this movie around them they will go on for hours about how silly and contrived all the scenes in the movie are. Denzel was in his usual semi-racist (but not too racist) role. Not to mention Gene Hackman playing his usual role of the "conservative" American who is nothing more than the worst human being imaginable. Arrogant, cocky, and of course, stubborn as a mule. Has anyone else noticed that he almost always plays the same character, just different situations? Bottom line is this movie is nothing more than Hollywood liberal propaganda, using the "manly-man" Gene Hackman as their fall guy for the stereotypical evil conservative who just needs to be re-educated (and usually is) in how to be a good little socialist. If you want to see a good submarine movie, see "The hunt for Red October". Otherwise, avoid this tired piece of liberal propaganda.

    This movie shows us a few men in a submarine.They have a mission there, since there is a risk of a nuclear war started by a crazy Russian man.Two men are fighting their own personal war down there.Crimson Tide (1995) is directed by Tony Scott.Just a little time ago we heard some tragic news that this great Hollywood director has killed himself at the age of 68.One can ask whether his best work had already been done, or would it have been yet to come.Denzel Washington, who worked with Tony in five films (this being the first one), is terrific as Lt. Commander Ron Hunter.What a thrill it is to watch Gene Hackman as Captain Frank Ramsey and the battle between his and Denzel's character.Matt Craven is great as Lt. Roy Zimmer.George Dzundza is brilliant as Chief of the Boat.Viggo Mortensen is superb as Lt. Peter Ince.James Gandolfini does great work as Lt. Bobby Dougherty.Rocky Carroll plays Lt. Darik Westergard.Danny Nucci is Petty Officer Danny Rivetti.Rick Schroder plays Lt. Paul Hellerman.Steve Zahn is William Barnes.Scott Grimes is seen as Petty Officer Hilaire.Ryan Phillippe is seen as Seaman Grattam.Jason Robards is in an uncredited role playing Rear Admiral Anderson.This is a great submarine movie.You can practically feel the tension they're feeling down there.Tony Scott, you did a great job!

    Crimson Tide is a submarine film directed by the late Tony Scott that stars Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington. It takes place during a period of political turmoil in the Russian Federation, in which ultra-nationalists threaten to launch nuclear missiles at the United States and Japan. It focuses on a clash of wills between the seasoned commanding officer (Gene Hackman) and the new executive officer (Denzel Washington) of a nuclear missile submarine, arising from conflicting interpretations of an order to launch their missiles. The film takes place during a period of instability in post-Soviet Russia. Units of the Russian military loyal to Radchenko, an ultra-nationalist, have taken control of a nuclear missile installation and are threatening nuclear war if either the American or the Russian government attempts to confront him. The United States nuclear strategic missile submarine USS Alabama is assigned a patrol mission, to be available to launch its missiles in a preemptive strike if Radchenko attempts to fuel the missiles his men have captured. Captain Frank Ramsey is the commanding officer of the sub, and one of the few commanders left in the Navy with any combat experience. He chooses as his new executive officer (XO) Lieutenant Commander Ron Hunter, who has an extensive education in military history and tactics, but no combat experience. During their initial days at sea, tensions between Ramsey and Hunter become apparent due to a clash of personalities: Hunter's more analytical, cautious approach towards his mission and the men, as opposed to Ramsey's more impulsive and intuitive approach. The Alabama eventually receives an Emergency Action Message from the National Command Authority, ordering the launch of ten of its SLBM missiles on the Russian nuclear installation, based on satellite information that the Russians' missiles are being fueled. Before the Alabama can launch, a second message arrives but is cut off by the attack of a Russian submarine friendly to Radchenko. The radio is damaged in the attack and is unable to decode the second message. With the last confirmed order being to launch, Captain Ramsey decides to proceed with the launch. Hunter refuses to concur as is procedurally required to launch, because he believes the partial second message may be a retraction. Hunter argues that the Alabama is not the only American submarine in the area, and if the order was not retracted, other submarines will launch their missiles. Ramsey argues that attack submarines may have destroyed any other American submarines and that they can't rely on someone else to carry out the order for them. Boasting taut, high energy thrills and some cracking dialogue courtesy of an uncredited Quentin Tarantino, Crimson Tide finds the late director Tony Scott near the top of his action game.It is a rare kind of war movie that not only thrills people while they're watching it, but invites them to leave the theater actually discussing the issues.And last but not the least,the performances in the film were top-notch. This is highly recommended for anyone who loves good movies.

    Crimson Tide is a must-see for anyone who likes action combined with drama or are big fans of A-list actors. Going into this movie, I expected something along the lines of The Hunt for the Red October. But what I got is a better film. This movie portrays possible real-life scenarios on whether or not submarine commanders should launch nuclear weapons. This is about a naval submarine heading to Russia to launch nuclear weapons on them. But after the radio transmission failed in the middle of the report, the captain and XO go out on each other determining what will be best thing for them to do. The acting is phenomenal. Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington are brand name actors who never do anything wrong. They are marvelous here as the captains. Overall, this is not like most thrillers. This one has a great build-up and a great ending. Also, I must note the score by Hans Zimmer. It is worth listening too. I rate this film 9/10.

    "Crimson Tide" is a 1995 film Starring Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman. The Tony Scott film involves a first officer (Washington) on a nuclear submarine who clashes with his captain (Hackman) over whether or not they have enough information to perform a first strike on a volatile Russia. As far as, Tony Scott films go, they're sort of hit or miss. I loved "Man On Fire" and "Unstoppable." However, movies like "Deja Vu" and "The Taking Of Pelham 123" are just sort of "meh" for me. This is partly because Mr. Scott made a very strange transition midway through his career. He went from using a really clean and traditional camera movement (as in "Top Gun," "True Romance," and "Crimson Tide") to using this really frenetic and trippy camera style (as in "Deja Vu," "Man On Fire," and "Unstoppable"). Sometimes the latter works, sometimes it doesn't, but one thing that usually has stayed amazingly consistent throughout Tony Scott's career is a brilliant lead performance from Denzel Washington. Tony Scott and Denzel Washington have collaborated together five times, and they've crafted some amazing stuff. "Crimson Tide" is no different here - Denzel sails through this movie with an utterly incredible finesse. However, while Denzel's performance is a force to be reckoned with, the best performance in this film is from none other than Popeye Doyle himself; Mr. Gene Hackman. His portrayal of Captain Frank Ramsey is one of the most menacing performances I've seen him give in a long while. Hackman owns this ship. In terms of directing, this movie in my opinion had everything "The Hunt For Red October" had, yet there was just a tad more. While "The Hunt For Red October" filmed it's underwater combat scenes using trick photography and models in midair, "Crimson Tide" actually shot their model ships underwater and utilized practical special effects on them regularly. While "The Hunt For Red October" had a brilliant score by Basil Poledouris, "Crimson Tide". . .had Hans Zimmer. Finally, while "The Hunt For Red October"'s plot was very interesting and definitely worth watching, "Crimson Tide" managed to be one of the most intense filmgoing experiences for me in a very long time - the fear of a nuclear holocaust is hammered into your head at an almost unsettling degree. White-knuckle film? You don't know the meaning of the term. "Crimson Tide" is an unbelievable film that I will not soon forget.

    When rebellious Russians seize control of their country's nuclear missiles, the fate of the entire free world hangs in the balance. To take care of the matter, the United States depends on a submarine in the Mediterranean Sea. The sub's captain is, according to the film's opening, one of the three most powerful men in the world (listed after the leaders of Russia and the USA). The "Alabama" is led my gun-ho veteran Gene Hackman (as Frank Ramsey). He has just hired cautious newcomer Denzel Washington (as Ron Hunter) as commander. They share an affection for horses, but do not agree on war action... The big problem occurs when Mr. Hackman and Mr. Washington interpret an "Emergency Action Message" differently. Due to a power failure, the message arrives incomplete. Hackman takes it as an order to launch a preemptive nuclear attack on Russia. Washington believes they should wait for clarity. Battle lines are drawn as the captain and commander are unable to agree... "Crimson Tide" is well-acted and nicely directed (by Tony Scott), but there is little logic or suspense. From the introduction of the co-stars, we know who is correct. Also, it's a silly movie. Washington uses pop culture to win friends and influence the crew. He lets Danny Nucci (as Rivetti) know who drew the best "Silver Surfer" and plays "Star Trek" with Lillo Brancato (as Vossler). ***** Crimson Tide (5/12/95) Tony Scott ~ Denzel Washington, Gene Hackman, George Dzundza, Viggo Mortensen

    There is a lot of ritual in the American military movies from the 90's. More than usual, that is. Crimson Tide is the story of a nuclear crisis when a crippled US submarine receives orders to fire nuclear missiles, then another partial message just before communications fail. The hardass captain (Hackman, of course) is countered in his desire to obey the launch order by the intellectual XO, played by Denzel Washington. And you have ritual in this as well: the speech before submarine launch, the wooden drills that have to happen "just so" with specific phrases and actions to reassure people they are doing the right thing. It's akin to religion and, by the very nature of the film, it makes you understand it was designed as such, transforming people into unthinking and uncaring machines. In truth, there isn't much to this movie in terms of story. The nuclear scenario is not really believable while the individual ideas in the film are simple and few. What makes the whole thing stand out is the great cast and their performance. There is some food for thought, though, because as far as the plot went, they really did receive a nuclear launch order when in all appearance, there was no need for one. That they recanted afterwards is of no relevance and perhaps a movie about that side of the story would be very interesting. Also, the ending shows that, as closed societies and fraternities often do, when a failure in their process or beliefs is found, it is quickly hidden under empty words and dirty bribes. Because even if they try to show the integrity of Hackman's character, the ending of the movie was just that: a bribe for a cover-up. As a conclusion, it is a classic film already, something that is worth watching for the sake of remembering the names of the actors in social situations alone, as James Gandolfini's character proves at the beginning of the film, and it also makes one think, if one is willing. What I found chilling is the joyful exuberance of the submarine troops when destroying the Russian one or the fanatic desire for some to follow the launch order. As Sting said, Russians love their children, too. So often in such movies, this element is completely ignored. That is what starts wars.

    Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer's 1995 film production of "Crimson Tide" has a good Submarine Dramatization Action/Thriller plot that features some intense action scenes, great cast, & excellent dialogue. The director, who made this film was Ridley Scott's younger brother Tony Scott. The film was released on May 12, 1995. The plot starts off with a news report that involves Russian rebels loyal to Vladimir Radchenko, an ultra nationalist, have hijacked a nuclear missile installation and are threatening nuclear war if either the American or Russian governments attempt to confront him. A U.S. Navy nuclear submarine, USS Alabama (SSBN-731), is assigned a mission, to be available to launch its missiles in a preemptive strike if Radchenko attempts to fuel his missiles. "The incredible Gene Hackman" portrays Captain Frank Ramsey, who is the commanding officer of USS Alabama. Before they officially start the mission, they need to hire a new X.O. and the choice that they picked is Lieutenant Commander Ron Hunter portrayed by Denzel Washington. Hunter is an expert in military history but, no combat experience. While on the way, there was an incident and Hunter had a disagreement with how Ramsey handled the plan, it's evident that Ramsey doesn't think too much of Hunter because he was college educated while Ramsey worked his way up. They're given strict commands to attack but when they were in the process of receiving another order, the ship's communications were damaged, so the whole message was not responded. Ramsey made a decision to continue with their previous order while Hunter wants to re-establish contact first. That's when the two men butt heads that ends with Hunter relieving Ramsey. Later when some men die, some of the officers feel that Hunter is not up to be in charge so they partner up to re-command control. But Hunter has taken precautions. The two then-semi-famous actors Viggo Mortensen (6 years before he portrayed the role as Aragon from The Lord of the rings trilogy) and James Gandolfini (4 years before he portrayed Italian-American crime boss Tony Soprano from the HBO crime series The Sopranos) both portrayed two supporting characters deputy Peter "Weps" Ince & Bobby Dougherty. Speaking of which, there is a cool moment in movie, when Weps, Bobby, and the rest of the crew on the bus to the submarine port were talking about old submarine movies like "The Enemy below" (1957) and "Run Silent Run Deep "(1958).They were also asking trivia question about Submarine movies each other: Weps asked Bobby who played the commander from Run Silent, Run Deep and then, Bobby answered "Cary Grant". That answer is actually wrong , it wasn't Cary Grant it was Clark Gable a.k.a The King of Hollywood , who portrayed the submarine commander from Run Silent, Run Deep. Both The Enemy Below and Run Silent, Run Deep of course made the same connection of the movie due to the same submarine film genre of those two films as they were mentioned in the film that is of course also Submarine film and that's why I find this moment of the movie to be cool. One of the deputies of the submarine, Bobby needs a little more character development. There is a realization that Bobby doesn't really have a lot of dialogue of the film but, I still think that he could be entertaining character at times. Jimmy's New Jersey accent makes his character is the main reason that make his character entertaining in the film. 36 year old James Gandolfini was still portraying supporting movie roles at the time he started in this movie. Bobby was the main deputy disagrees on Hunter taking over the submarine. I find Hans Zimmer's film score in the action scenes of the film to be very thrilling. The sounds from the orchestra, choir and synthesizer makes the film score thrilling. Hans Zimmer won a Grammy award of this film score in 1996.This film score is one of Hans Zimmer's personal favorites along with The Lion King and Gladiator. Both Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman acted out on their lead characters really well. The way that they were both taking command of submarine was serious in a intensive way. The arguments about their disagreements that they had, made it intensively serious. I highly recommend that movie for people in general and especially people, who are into submarine movies like "Das Boot". I find the movie to be "Thrilling. I give a 3 out of 4 stars.

    Crimson Tide is a submarine film directed by the late Tony Scott that stars Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington. It takes place during a period of political turmoil in the Russian Federation, in which ultra-nationalists threaten to launch nuclear missiles at the United States and Japan. It focuses on a clash of wills between the seasoned commanding officer (Gene Hackman) and the new executive officer (Denzel Washington) of a nuclear missile submarine, arising from conflicting interpretations of an order to launch their missiles. The film takes place during a period of instability in post-Soviet Russia. Units of the Russian military loyal to Radchenko, an ultra-nationalist, have taken control of a nuclear missile installation and are threatening nuclear war if either the American or the Russian government attempts to confront him. The United States nuclear strategic missile submarine USS Alabama is assigned a patrol mission, to be available to launch its missiles in a preemptive strike if Radchenko attempts to fuel the missiles his men have captured. Captain Frank Ramsey is the commanding officer of the sub, and one of the few commanders left in the Navy with any combat experience. He chooses as his new executive officer (XO) Lieutenant Commander Ron Hunter, who has an extensive education in military history and tactics, but no combat experience. During their initial days at sea, tensions between Ramsey and Hunter become apparent due to a clash of personalities: Hunter's more analytical, cautious approach towards his mission and the men, as opposed to Ramsey's more impulsive and intuitive approach. The Alabama eventually receives an Emergency Action Message from the National Command Authority, ordering the launch of ten of its SLBM missiles on the Russian nuclear installation, based on satellite information that the Russians' missiles are being fueled. Before the Alabama can launch, a second message arrives but is cut off by the attack of a Russian submarine friendly to Radchenko. The radio is damaged in the attack and is unable to decode the second message. With the last confirmed order being to launch, Captain Ramsey decides to proceed with the launch. Hunter refuses to concur as is procedurally required to launch, because he believes the partial second message may be a retraction. Hunter argues that the Alabama is not the only American submarine in the area, and if the order was not retracted, other submarines will launch their missiles. Ramsey argues that attack submarines may have destroyed any other American submarines and that they can't rely on someone else to carry out the order for them. Boasting taut, high energy thrills and some cracking dialogue courtesy of an uncredited Quentin Tarantino, Crimson Tide finds the late director Tony Scott near the top of his action game.It is a rare kind of war movie that not only thrills people while they're watching it, but invites them to leave the theater actually discussing the issues.And last but not the least,the performances in the film were top-notch. This is highly recommended for anyone who loves good movies.

    Crimson Tide is a must-see for anyone who likes action combined with drama or are big fans of A-list actors. Going into this movie, I expected something along the lines of The Hunt for the Red October. But what I got is a better film. This movie portrays possible real-life scenarios on whether or not submarine commanders should launch nuclear weapons. This is about a naval submarine heading to Russia to launch nuclear weapons on them. But after the radio transmission failed in the middle of the report, the captain and XO go out on each other determining what will be best thing for them to do. The acting is phenomenal. Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington are brand name actors who never do anything wrong. They are marvelous here as the captains. Overall, this is not like most thrillers. This one has a great build-up and a great ending. Also, I must note the score by Hans Zimmer. It is worth listening too. I rate this film 9/10.

    "Crimson Tide" is a 1995 film Starring Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman. The Tony Scott film involves a first officer (Washington) on a nuclear submarine who clashes with his captain (Hackman) over whether or not they have enough information to perform a first strike on a volatile Russia. As far as, Tony Scott films go, they're sort of hit or miss. I loved "Man On Fire" and "Unstoppable." However, movies like "Deja Vu" and "The Taking Of Pelham 123" are just sort of "meh" for me. This is partly because Mr. Scott made a very strange transition midway through his career. He went from using a really clean and traditional camera movement (as in "Top Gun," "True Romance," and "Crimson Tide") to using this really frenetic and trippy camera style (as in "Deja Vu," "Man On Fire," and "Unstoppable"). Sometimes the latter works, sometimes it doesn't, but one thing that usually has stayed amazingly consistent throughout Tony Scott's career is a brilliant lead performance from Denzel Washington. Tony Scott and Denzel Washington have collaborated together five times, and they've crafted some amazing stuff. "Crimson Tide" is no different here - Denzel sails through this movie with an utterly incredible finesse. However, while Denzel's performance is a force to be reckoned with, the best performance in this film is from none other than Popeye Doyle himself; Mr. Gene Hackman. His portrayal of Captain Frank Ramsey is one of the most menacing performances I've seen him give in a long while. Hackman owns this ship. In terms of directing, this movie in my opinion had everything "The Hunt For Red October" had, yet there was just a tad more. While "The Hunt For Red October" filmed it's underwater combat scenes using trick photography and models in midair, "Crimson Tide" actually shot their model ships underwater and utilized practical special effects on them regularly. While "The Hunt For Red October" had a brilliant score by Basil Poledouris, "Crimson Tide". . .had Hans Zimmer. Finally, while "The Hunt For Red October"'s plot was very interesting and definitely worth watching, "Crimson Tide" managed to be one of the most intense filmgoing experiences for me in a very long time - the fear of a nuclear holocaust is hammered into your head at an almost unsettling degree. White-knuckle film? You don't know the meaning of the term. "Crimson Tide" is an unbelievable film that I will not soon forget.

    When rebellious Russians seize control of their country's nuclear missiles, the fate of the entire free world hangs in the balance. To take care of the matter, the United States depends on a submarine in the Mediterranean Sea. The sub's captain is, according to the film's opening, one of the three most powerful men in the world (listed after the leaders of Russia and the USA). The "Alabama" is led my gun-ho veteran Gene Hackman (as Frank Ramsey). He has just hired cautious newcomer Denzel Washington (as Ron Hunter) as commander. They share an affection for horses, but do not agree on war action... The big problem occurs when Mr. Hackman and Mr. Washington interpret an "Emergency Action Message" differently. Due to a power failure, the message arrives incomplete. Hackman takes it as an order to launch a preemptive nuclear attack on Russia. Washington believes they should wait for clarity. Battle lines are drawn as the captain and commander are unable to agree... "Crimson Tide" is well-acted and nicely directed (by Tony Scott), but there is little logic or suspense. From the introduction of the co-stars, we know who is correct. Also, it's a silly movie. Washington uses pop culture to win friends and influence the crew. He lets Danny Nucci (as Rivetti) know who drew the best "Silver Surfer" and plays "Star Trek" with Lillo Brancato (as Vossler). ***** Crimson Tide (5/12/95) Tony Scott ~ Denzel Washington, Gene Hackman, George Dzundza, Viggo Mortensen

    There is a lot of ritual in the American military movies from the 90's. More than usual, that is. Crimson Tide is the story of a nuclear crisis when a crippled US submarine receives orders to fire nuclear missiles, then another partial message just before communications fail. The hardass captain (Hackman, of course) is countered in his desire to obey the launch order by the intellectual XO, played by Denzel Washington. And you have ritual in this as well: the speech before submarine launch, the wooden drills that have to happen "just so" with specific phrases and actions to reassure people they are doing the right thing. It's akin to religion and, by the very nature of the film, it makes you understand it was designed as such, transforming people into unthinking and uncaring machines. In truth, there isn't much to this movie in terms of story. The nuclear scenario is not really believable while the individual ideas in the film are simple and few. What makes the whole thing stand out is the great cast and their performance. There is some food for thought, though, because as far as the plot went, they really did receive a nuclear launch order when in all appearance, there was no need for one. That they recanted afterwards is of no relevance and perhaps a movie about that side of the story would be very interesting. Also, the ending shows that, as closed societies and fraternities often do, when a failure in their process or beliefs is found, it is quickly hidden under empty words and dirty bribes. Because even if they try to show the integrity of Hackman's character, the ending of the movie was just that: a bribe for a cover-up. As a conclusion, it is a classic film already, something that is worth watching for the sake of remembering the names of the actors in social situations alone, as James Gandolfini's character proves at the beginning of the film, and it also makes one think, if one is willing. What I found chilling is the joyful exuberance of the submarine troops when destroying the Russian one or the fanatic desire for some to follow the launch order. As Sting said, Russians love their children, too. So often in such movies, this element is completely ignored. That is what starts wars.

    Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer's 1995 film production of "Crimson Tide" has a good Submarine Dramatization Action/Thriller plot that features some intense action scenes, great cast, & excellent dialogue. The director, who made this film was Ridley Scott's younger brother Tony Scott. The film was released on May 12, 1995. The plot starts off with a news report that involves Russian rebels loyal to Vladimir Radchenko, an ultra nationalist, have hijacked a nuclear missile installation and are threatening nuclear war if either the American or Russian governments attempt to confront him. A U.S. Navy nuclear submarine, USS Alabama (SSBN-731), is assigned a mission, to be available to launch its missiles in a preemptive strike if Radchenko attempts to fuel his missiles. "The incredible Gene Hackman" portrays Captain Frank Ramsey, who is the commanding officer of USS Alabama. Before they officially start the mission, they need to hire a new X.O. and the choice that they picked is Lieutenant Commander Ron Hunter portrayed by Denzel Washington. Hunter is an expert in military history but, no combat experience. While on the way, there was an incident and Hunter had a disagreement with how Ramsey handled the plan, it's evident that Ramsey doesn't think too much of Hunter because he was college educated while Ramsey worked his way up. They're given strict commands to attack but when they were in the process of receiving another order, the ship's communications were damaged, so the whole message was not responded. Ramsey made a decision to continue with their previous order while Hunter wants to re-establish contact first. That's when the two men butt heads that ends with Hunter relieving Ramsey. Later when some men die, some of the officers feel that Hunter is not up to be in charge so they partner up to re-command control. But Hunter has taken precautions. The two then-semi-famous actors Viggo Mortensen (6 years before he portrayed the role as Aragon from The Lord of the rings trilogy) and James Gandolfini (4 years before he portrayed Italian-American crime boss Tony Soprano from the HBO crime series The Sopranos) both portrayed two supporting characters deputy Peter "Weps" Ince & Bobby Dougherty. Speaking of which, there is a cool moment in movie, when Weps, Bobby, and the rest of the crew on the bus to the submarine port were talking about old submarine movies like "The Enemy below" (1957) and "Run Silent Run Deep "(1958).They were also asking trivia question about Submarine movies each other: Weps asked Bobby who played the commander from Run Silent, Run Deep and then, Bobby answered "Cary Grant". That answer is actually wrong , it wasn't Cary Grant it was Clark Gable a.k.a The King of Hollywood , who portrayed the submarine commander from Run Silent, Run Deep. Both The Enemy Below and Run Silent, Run Deep of course made the same connection of the movie due to the same submarine film genre of those two films as they were mentioned in the film that is of course also Submarine film and that's why I find this moment of the movie to be cool. One of the deputies of the submarine, Bobby needs a little more character development. There is a realization that Bobby doesn't really have a lot of dialogue of the film but, I still think that he could be entertaining character at times. Jimmy's New Jersey accent makes his character is the main reason that make his character entertaining in the film. 36 year old James Gandolfini was still portraying supporting movie roles at the time he started in this movie. Bobby was the main deputy disagrees on Hunter taking over the submarine. I find Hans Zimmer's film score in the action scenes of the film to be very thrilling. The sounds from the orchestra, choir and synthesizer makes the film score thrilling. Hans Zimmer won a Grammy award of this film score in 1996.This film score is one of Hans Zimmer's personal favorites along with The Lion King and Gladiator. Both Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman acted out on their lead characters really well. The way that they were both taking command of submarine was serious in a intensive way. The arguments about their disagreements that they had, made it intensively serious. I highly recommend that movie for people in general and especially people, who are into submarine movies like "Das Boot". I find the movie to be "Thrilling. I give a 3 out of 4 stars.

    World War III is about to break out in the Tony Scott's movie 'Crimson Tide', when political turmoil in Russia has caused worries in United States when Russia ultra-nationalists threaten to launch nuclear missiles at them. The movie focuses on the military mission of the USS Alabama, a nuclear submarine whom duty is to launch missions back into Russia if war breaks out. The submarine is split in conflicting opinions and wills between the seasoned commanding officer Captain Frank Ramsey (Gene Hackman) and the new executive officer Lt. Ron Hunter (Denzel Washington) on the interpretations of an order to launch their missiles. In the nuclear world, the true enemy is war itself. The movie has this 'Mutiny of the Bounty' feel to it, as the audience is swept into a very plausible scenario between Hunter's more analytical, cautious approach, as opposed to Ramsey's more impulsive and intuitive approach to the mission. Great acting from both of them. I love the exchange between Hackman and Washington on the topic of Lipizzaner horses and Von Clausewitz' view of war. Indeed, all the actors have their moments to shine, including Viggo Mortensen, James Gandolfini and an excellent George Dzundza. The movie is a great suspense with an amazing music score by Hans Zimmer. The heavy use of synthesizers in place of traditional orchestral instruments sound chilling like an old Gothic church's choirs. The well-known naval hymn, "Eternal Father, Strong to Save" is given an new spin into it. It's great to note that Harry Gregson-Williams help with the bass thumbing. Great to hear on large speakers the score. The movie has excellent visuals for a smart and tense film. Now to the faults of the film, while Richard Hendrick wrote the novel, he probably knew little about submarines as a lot of the real life Navy's submariners didn't like the film. The movie had many breaches of naval protocols that it became too unrealizable to them. Example are such like Supply Officers are restricted, and cannot be put into a position to where they could take command. They don't have the training to do so. The real life Navy regulations would have Hunter disciplined for insubordination and replaced with another XO no matter what happen on the boat. Still, I like the submarine lingoes, even if I didn't understand them. Both Washington and Hackman play stereotypical roles to the point, it's seem more about a race issue between Black VS White, than an issue about launching nuclear weapons. Who brings up semi-racism likes comments like what color the most trained horse are? Was the racial subtext, necessary? The way, Denzel Washington talks to his subordinates as if they are children is a bit odd. I wouldn't have thought for once a Star Trek or a Silver Surfer reference was going to be in this type of film. Don't get me wrong, it's cool to hear it, but I would love for the movie in those scenes to be taking more serious. What part of the Navy allows a dog on submarine unless it's a K9 unit? Even if you're the captain, I doubt you can bring a dog to pee everywhere. Forget about Tide. Even Clorox could not clean up that mistake. Overall: Crimson Tide is a great movie. Worth watching.

    Prior to Tony Scott's recent suicide, I hadn't seen most of his movies. But now I've seen "Crimson Tide". This portrays tension aboard a nuclear submarine when the hot-headed captain (Gene Hackman) wants to go ahead with a launch while the restrained executive officer (Denzel Washington) wants to wait for another signal. I didn't think that it was a great movie, but the context of rebel forces in Russia threatening to launch nukes brings up the issue of how secure weapons of mass destruction anywhere are, combined with the risk that a trigger-happy might ignore an incomplete message and decide to launch weapons. The point is, who can truly be considered sane in a completely insane situation? Like I said, it's not any kind of masterpiece, but still worth seeing. Great tension between Hackman and Washington. Appearing in early roles are James Gandolfini, Steve Zahn, Ryan Philippe and Daniel Von Bargen.

    First off, id like to say that if you know nothing about the military (or you hate it) you will like this movie. If you know anything about submariners, its an absolute joke. NO WAY ANY OF THIS WOULD EVER GO ON IN A NUCLEAR SUB! I was never in the military myself but I have many friends who were and I can tell you that if you bring up this movie around them they will go on for hours about how silly and contrived all the scenes in the movie are. Denzel was in his usual semi-racist (but not too racist) role. Not to mention Gene Hackman playing his usual role of the "conservative" American who is nothing more than the worst human being imaginable. Arrogant, cocky, and of course, stubborn as a mule. Has anyone else noticed that he almost always plays the same character, just different situations? Bottom line is this movie is nothing more than Hollywood liberal propaganda, using the "manly-man" Gene Hackman as their fall guy for the stereotypical evil conservative who just needs to be re-educated (and usually is) in how to be a good little socialist. If you want to see a good submarine movie, see "The hunt for Red October". Otherwise, avoid this tired piece of liberal propaganda.

Battle lines are drawn as the captain and commander are unable to agree... "Crimson Tide" is well-acted and nicely directed (by Tony Scott), but there is little logic or suspense. From the introduction of the co-stars, we know who is correct. Also, it's a silly movie. Washington uses pop culture to win friends and influence the crew. He lets Danny Nucci (as Rivetti) know who drew the best "Silver Surfer" and plays "Star Trek" with Lillo Brancato (as Vossler). ***** Crimson Tide (5/12/95) Tony Scott ~ Denzel Washington, Gene Hackman, George Dzundza, Viggo Mortensen

    There is a lot of ritual in the American military movies from the 90's. More than usual, that is. Crimson Tide is the story of a nuclear crisis when a crippled US submarine receives orders to fire nuclear missiles, then another partial message just before communications fail. The hardass captain (Hackman, of course) is countered in his desire to obey the launch order by the intellectual XO, played by Denzel Washington. And you have ritual in this as well: the speech before submarine launch, the wooden drills that have to happen "just so" with specific phrases and actions to reassure people they are doing the right thing. It's akin to religion and, by the very nature of the film, it makes you understand it was designed as such, transforming people into unthinking and uncaring machines. In truth, there isn't much to this movie in terms of story. The nuclear scenario is not really believable while the individual ideas in the film are simple and few. What makes the whole thing stand out is the great cast and their performance. There is some food for thought, though, because as far as the plot went, they really did receive a nuclear launch order when in all appearance, there was no need for one. That they recanted afterwards is of no relevance and perhaps a movie about that side of the story would be very interesting. Also, the ending shows that, as closed societies and fraternities often do, when a failure in their process or beliefs is found, it is quickly hidden under empty words and dirty bribes. Because even if they try to show the integrity of Hackman's character, the ending of the movie was just that: a bribe for a cover-up. As a conclusion, it is a classic film already, something that is worth watching for the sake of remembering the names of the actors in social situations alone, as James Gandolfini's character proves at the beginning of the film, and it also makes one think, if one is willing. What I found chilling is the joyful exuberance of the submarine troops when destroying the Russian one or the fanatic desire for some to follow the launch order. As Sting said, Russians love their children, too. So often in such movies, this element is completely ignored. That is what starts wars.

    Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer's 1995 film production of "Crimson Tide" has a good Submarine Dramatization Action/Thriller plot that features some intense action scenes, great cast, & excellent dialogue. The director, who made this film was Ridley Scott's younger brother Tony Scott. The film was released on May 12, 1995. The plot starts off with a news report that involves Russian rebels loyal to Vladimir Radchenko, an ultra nationalist, have hijacked a nuclear missile installation and are threatening nuclear war if either the American or Russian governments attempt to confront him. A U.S. Navy nuclear submarine, USS Alabama (SSBN-731), is assigned a mission, to be available to launch its missiles in a preemptive strike if Radchenko attempts to fuel his missiles. "The incredible Gene Hackman" portrays Captain Frank Ramsey, who is the commanding officer of USS Alabama. Before they officially start the mission, they need to hire a new X.O. and the choice that they picked is Lieutenant Commander Ron Hunter portrayed by Denzel Washington. Hunter is an expert in military history but, no combat experience. While on the way, there was an incident and Hunter had a disagreement with how Ramsey handled the plan, it's evident that Ramsey doesn't think too much of Hunter because he was college educated while Ramsey worked his way up. They're given strict commands to attack but when they were in the process of receiving another order, the ship's communications were damaged, so the whole message was not responded. Ramsey made a decision to continue with their previous order while Hunter wants to re-establish contact first. That's when the two men butt heads that ends with Hunter relieving Ramsey. Later when some men die, some of the officers feel that Hunter is not up to be in charge so they partner up to re-command control. But Hunter has taken precautions. The two then-semi-famous actors Viggo Mortensen (6 years before he portrayed the role as Aragon from The Lord of the rings trilogy) and James Gandolfini (4 years before he portrayed Italian-American crime boss Tony Soprano from the HBO crime series The Sopranos) both portrayed two supporting characters deputy Peter "Weps" Ince & Bobby Dougherty. Speaking of which, there is a cool moment in movie, when Weps, Bobby, and the rest of the crew on the bus to the submarine port were talking about old submarine movies like "The Enemy below" (1957) and "Run Silent Run Deep "(1958).They were also asking trivia question about Submarine movies each other: Weps asked Bobby who played the commander from Run Silent, Run Deep and then, Bobby answered "Cary Grant". That answer is actually wrong , it wasn't Cary Grant it was Clark Gable a.k.a The King of Hollywood , who portrayed the submarine commander from Run Silent, Run Deep. Both The Enemy Below and Run Silent, Run Deep of course made the same connection of the movie due to the same submarine film genre of those two films as they were mentioned in the film that is of course also Submarine film and that's why I find this moment of the movie to be cool. One of the deputies of the submarine, Bobby needs a little more character development. There is a realization that Bobby doesn't really have a lot of dialogue of the film but, I still think that he could be entertaining character at times. Jimmy's New Jersey accent makes his character is the main reason that make his character entertaining in the film. 36 year old James Gandolfini was still portraying supporting movie roles at the time he started in this movie. Bobby was the main deputy disagrees on Hunter taking over the submarine. I find Hans Zimmer's film score in the action scenes of the film to be very thrilling. The sounds from the orchestra, choir and synthesizer makes the film score thrilling. Hans Zimmer won a Grammy award of this film score in 1996.This film score is one of Hans Zimmer's personal favorites along with The Lion King and Gladiator. Both Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman acted out on their lead characters really well. The way that they were both taking command of submarine was serious in a intensive way. The arguments about their disagreements that they had, made it intensively serious. I highly recommend that movie for people in general and especially people, who are into submarine movies like "Das Boot". I find the movie to be "Thrilling. I give a 3 out of 4 stars.

    World War III is about to break out in the Tony Scott's movie 'Crimson Tide', when political turmoil in Russia has caused worries in United States when Russia ultra-nationalists threaten to launch nuclear missiles at them. The movie focuses on the military mission of the USS Alabama, a nuclear submarine whom duty is to launch missions back into Russia if war breaks out. The submarine is split in conflicting opinions and wills between the seasoned commanding officer Captain Frank Ramsey (Gene Hackman) and the new executive officer Lt. Ron Hunter (Denzel Washington) on the interpretations of an order to launch their missiles. In the nuclear world, the true enemy is war itself. The movie has this 'Mutiny of the Bounty' feel to it, as the audience is swept into a very plausible scenario between Hunter's more analytical, cautious approach, as opposed to Ramsey's more impulsive and intuitive approach to the mission. Great acting from both of them. I love the exchange between Hackman and Washington on the topic of Lipizzaner horses and Von Clausewitz' view of war. Indeed, all the actors have their moments to shine, including Viggo Mortensen, James Gandolfini and an excellent George Dzundza. The movie is a great suspense with an amazing music score by Hans Zimmer. The heavy use of synthesizers in place of traditional orchestral instruments sound chilling like an old Gothic church's choirs. The well-known naval hymn, "Eternal Father, Strong to Save" is given an new spin into it. It's great to note that Harry Gregson-Williams help with the bass thumbing. Great to hear on large speakers the score. The movie has excellent visuals for a smart and tense film. Now to the faults of the film, while Richard Hendrick wrote the novel, he probably knew little about submarines as a lot of the real life Navy's submariners didn't like the film. The movie had many breaches of naval protocols that it became too unrealizable to them. Example are such like Supply Officers are restricted, and cannot be put into a position to where they could take command. They don't have the training to do so. The real life Navy regulations would have Hunter disciplined for insubordination and replaced with another XO no matter what happen on the boat. Still, I like the submarine lingoes, even if I didn't understand them. Both Washington and Hackman play stereotypical roles to the point, it's seem more about a race issue between Black VS White, than an issue about launching nuclear weapons. Who brings up semi-racism likes comments like what color the most trained horse are? Was the racial subtext, necessary? The way, Denzel Washington talks to his subordinates as if they are children is a bit odd. I wouldn't have thought for once a Star Trek or a Silver Surfer reference was going to be in this type of film. Don't get me wrong, it's cool to hear it, but I would love for the movie in those scenes to be taking more serious. What part of the Navy allows a dog on submarine unless it's a K9 unit? Even if you're the captain, I doubt you can bring a dog to pee everywhere. Forget about Tide. Even Clorox could not clean up that mistake. Overall: Crimson Tide is a great movie. Worth watching.

    Prior to Tony Scott's recent suicide, I hadn't seen most of his movies. But now I've seen "Crimson Tide". This portrays tension aboard a nuclear submarine when the hot-headed captain (Gene Hackman) wants to go ahead with a launch while the restrained executive officer (Denzel Washington) wants to wait for another signal. I didn't think that it was a great movie, but the context of rebel forces in Russia threatening to launch nukes brings up the issue of how secure weapons of mass destruction anywhere are, combined with the risk that a trigger-happy might ignore an incomplete message and decide to launch weapons. The point is, who can truly be considered sane in a completely insane situation? Like I said, it's not any kind of masterpiece, but still worth seeing. Great tension between Hackman and Washington. Appearing in early roles are James Gandolfini, Steve Zahn, Ryan Philippe and Daniel Von Bargen.

    First off, id like to say that if you know nothing about the military (or you hate it) you will like this movie. If you know anything about submariners, its an absolute joke. NO WAY ANY OF THIS WOULD EVER GO ON IN A NUCLEAR SUB! I was never in the military myself but I have many friends who were and I can tell you that if you bring up this movie around them they will go on for hours about how silly and contrived all the scenes in the movie are. Denzel was in his usual semi-racist (but not too racist) role. Not to mention Gene Hackman playing his usual role of the "conservative" American who is nothing more than the worst human being imaginable. Arrogant, cocky, and of course, stubborn as a mule. Has anyone else noticed that he almost always plays the same character, just different situations? Bottom line is this movie is nothing more than Hollywood liberal propaganda, using the "manly-man" Gene Hackman as their fall guy for the stereotypical evil conservative who just needs to be re-educated (and usually is) in how to be a good little socialist. If you want to see a good submarine movie, see "The hunt for Red October". Otherwise, avoid this tired piece of liberal propaganda.

    This movie shows us a few men in a submarine.They have a mission there, since there is a risk of a nuclear war started by a crazy Russian man.Two men are fighting their own personal war down there.Crimson Tide (1995) is directed by Tony Scott.Just a little time ago we heard some tragic news that this great Hollywood director has killed himself at the age of 68.One can ask whether his best work had already been done, or would it have been yet to come.Denzel Washington, who worked with Tony in five films (this being the first one), is terrific as Lt. Commander Ron Hunter.What a thrill it is to watch Gene Hackman as Captain Frank Ramsey and the battle between his and Denzel's character.Matt Craven is great as Lt. Roy Zimmer.George Dzundza is brilliant as Chief of the Boat.Viggo Mortensen is superb as Lt. Peter Ince.James Gandolfini does great work as Lt. Bobby Dougherty.Rocky Carroll plays Lt. Darik Westergard.Danny Nucci is Petty Officer Danny Rivetti.Rick Schroder plays Lt. Paul Hellerman.Steve Zahn is William Barnes.Scott Grimes is seen as Petty Officer Hilaire.Ryan Phillippe is seen as Seaman Grattam.Jason Robards is in an uncredited role playing Rear Admiral Anderson.This is a great submarine movie.You can practically feel the tension they're feeling down there.Tony Scott, you did a great job!

    Crimson Tide is a submarine film directed by the late Tony Scott that stars Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington. It takes place during a period of political turmoil in the Russian Federation, in which ultra-nationalists threaten to launch nuclear missiles at the United States and Japan. It focuses on a clash of wills between the seasoned commanding officer (Gene Hackman) and the new executive officer (Denzel Washington) of a nuclear missile submarine, arising from conflicting interpretations of an order to launch their missiles. The film takes place during a period of instability in post-Soviet Russia. Units of the Russian military loyal to Radchenko, an ultra-nationalist, have taken control of a nuclear missile installation and are threatening nuclear war if either the American or the Russian government attempts to confront him. The United States nuclear strategic missile submarine USS Alabama is assigned a patrol mission, to be available to launch its missiles in a preemptive strike if Radchenko attempts to fuel the missiles his men have captured. Captain Frank Ramsey is the commanding officer of the sub, and one of the few commanders left in the Navy with any combat experience. He chooses as his new executive officer (XO) Lieutenant Commander Ron Hunter, who has an extensive education in military history and tactics, but no combat experience. During their initial days at sea, tensions between Ramsey and Hunter become apparent due to a clash of personalities: Hunter's more analytical, cautious approach towards his mission and the men, as opposed to Ramsey's more impulsive and intuitive approach. The Alabama eventually receives an Emergency Action Message from the National Command Authority, ordering the launch of ten of its SLBM missiles on the Russian nuclear installation, based on satellite information that the Russians' missiles are being fueled. Before the Alabama can launch, a second message arrives but is cut off by the attack of a Russian submarine friendly to Radchenko. The radio is damaged in the attack and is unable to decode the second message. With the last confirmed order being to launch, Captain Ramsey decides to proceed with the launch. Hunter refuses to concur as is procedurally required to launch, because he believes the partial second message may be a retraction. Hunter argues that the Alabama is not the only American submarine in the area, and if the order was not retracted, other submarines will launch their missiles. Ramsey argues that attack submarines may have destroyed any other American submarines and that they can't rely on someone else to carry out the order for them. Boasting taut, high energy thrills and some cracking dialogue courtesy of an uncredited Quentin Tarantino, Crimson Tide finds the late director Tony Scott near the top of his action game.It is a rare kind of war movie that not only thrills people while they're watching it, but invites them to leave the theater actually discussing the issues.And last but not the least,the performances in the film were top-notch. This is highly recommended for anyone who loves good movies.

    Crimson Tide is a must-see for anyone who likes action combined with drama or are big fans of A-list actors. Going into this movie, I expected something along the lines of The Hunt for the Red October. But what I got is a better film. This movie portrays possible real-life scenarios on whether or not submarine commanders should launch nuclear weapons. This is about a naval submarine heading to Russia to launch nuclear weapons on them. But after the radio transmission failed in the middle of the report, the captain and XO go out on each other determining what will be best thing for them to do. The acting is phenomenal. Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington are brand name actors who never do anything wrong. They are marvelous here as the captains. Overall, this is not like most thrillers. This one has a great build-up and a great ending. Also, I must note the score by Hans Zimmer. It is worth listening too. I rate this film 9/10.

    "Crimson Tide" is a 1995 film Starring Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman. The Tony Scott film involves a first officer (Washington) on a nuclear submarine who clashes with his captain (Hackman) over whether or not they have enough information to perform a first strike on a volatile Russia. As far as, Tony Scott films go, they're sort of hit or miss. I loved "Man On Fire" and "Unstoppable." However, movies like "Deja Vu" and "The Taking Of Pelham 123" are just sort of "meh" for me. This is partly because Mr. Scott made a very strange transition midway through his career. He went from using a really clean and traditional camera movement (as in "Top Gun," "True Romance," and "Crimson Tide") to using this really frenetic and trippy camera style (as in "Deja Vu," "Man On Fire," and "Unstoppable"). Sometimes the latter works, sometimes it doesn't, but one thing that usually has stayed amazingly consistent throughout Tony Scott's career is a brilliant lead performance from Denzel Washington. Tony Scott and Denzel Washington have collaborated together five times, and they've crafted some amazing stuff. "Crimson Tide" is no different here - Denzel sails through this movie with an utterly incredible finesse. However, while Denzel's performance is a force to be reckoned with, the best performance in this film is from none other than Popeye Doyle himself; Mr. Gene Hackman. His portrayal of Captain Frank Ramsey is one of the most menacing performances I've seen him give in a long while. Hackman owns this ship. In terms of directing, this movie in my opinion had everything "The Hunt For Red October" had, yet there was just a tad more. While "The Hunt For Red October" filmed it's underwater combat scenes using trick photography and models in midair, "Crimson Tide" actually shot their model ships underwater and utilized practical special effects on them regularly. While "The Hunt For Red October" had a brilliant score by Basil Poledouris, "Crimson Tide". . .had Hans Zimmer. Finally, while "The Hunt For Red October"'s plot was very interesting and definitely worth watching, "Crimson Tide" managed to be one of the most intense filmgoing experiences for me in a very long time - the fear of a nuclear holocaust is hammered into your head at an almost unsettling degree. White-knuckle film? You don't know the meaning of the term. "Crimson Tide" is an unbelievable film that I will not soon forget.

    When rebellious Russians seize control of their country's nuclear missiles, the fate of the entire free world hangs in the balance. To take care of the matter, the United States depends on a submarine in the Mediterranean Sea. The sub's captain is, according to the film's opening, one of the three most powerful men in the world (listed after the leaders of Russia and the USA). The "Alabama" is led my gun-ho veteran Gene Hackman (as Frank Ramsey). He has just hired cautious newcomer Denzel Washington (as Ron Hunter) as commander. They share an affection for horses, but do not agree on war action... The big problem occurs when Mr. Hackman and Mr. Washington interpret an "Emergency Action Message" differently. Due to a power failure, the message arrives incomplete. Hackman takes it as an order to launch a preemptive nuclear attack on Russia. Washington believes they should wait for clarity. Battle lines are drawn as the captain and commander are unable to agree... "Crimson Tide" is well-acted and nicely directed (by Tony Scott), but there is little logic or suspense. From the introduction of the co-stars, we know who is correct. Also, it's a silly movie. Washington uses pop culture to win friends and influence the crew. He lets Danny Nucci (as Rivetti) know who drew the best "Silver Surfer" and plays "Star Trek" with Lillo Brancato (as Vossler). ***** Crimson Tide (5/12/95) Tony Scott ~ Denzel Washington, Gene Hackman, George Dzundza, Viggo Mortensen

Later when some men die, some of the officers feel that Hunter is not up to be in charge so they partner up to re-command control. But Hunter has taken precautions. The two then-semi-famous actors Viggo Mortensen (6 years before he portrayed the role as Aragon from The Lord of the rings trilogy) and James Gandolfini (4 years before he portrayed Italian-American crime boss Tony Soprano from the HBO crime series The Sopranos) both portrayed two supporting characters deputy Peter "Weps" Ince & Bobby Dougherty.

Great to hear on large speakers the score. The movie has excellent visuals for a smart and tense film. Now to the faults of the film, while Richard Hendrick wrote the novel, he probably knew little about submarines as a lot of the real life Navy's submariners didn't like the film. The movie had many breaches of naval protocols that it became too unrealizable to them. Example are such like Supply Officers are restricted, and cannot be put into a position to where they could take command. They don't have the training to do so. The real life Navy regulations would have Hunter disciplined for insubordination and replaced with another XO no matter what happen on the boat. Still, I like the submarine lingoes, even if I didn't understand them. Both Washington and Hackman play stereotypical roles to the point, it's seem more about a race issue between Black VS White, than an issue about launching nuclear weapons. Who brings up semi-racism likes comments like what color the most trained horse are? Was the racial subtext, necessary? The way, Denzel Washington talks to his subordinates as if they are children is a bit odd. I wouldn't have thought for once a Star Trek or a Silver Surfer reference was going to be in this type of film. Don't get me wrong, it's cool to hear it, but I would love for the movie in those scenes to be taking more serious. What part of the Navy allows a dog on submarine unless it's a K9 unit? Even if you're the captain, I doubt you can bring a dog to pee everywhere. Forget about Tide. Even Clorox could not clean up that mistake. Overall: Crimson Tide is a great movie. Worth watching.

    Prior to Tony Scott's recent suicide, I hadn't seen most of his movies. But now I've seen "Crimson Tide". This portrays tension aboard a nuclear submarine when the hot-headed captain (Gene Hackman) wants to go ahead with a launch while the restrained executive officer (Denzel Washington) wants to wait for another signal. I didn't think that it was a great movie, but the context of rebel forces in Russia threatening to launch nukes brings up the issue of how secure weapons of mass destruction anywhere are, combined with the risk that a trigger-happy might ignore an incomplete message and decide to launch weapons. The point is, who can truly be considered sane in a completely insane situation? Like I said, it's not any kind of masterpiece, but still worth seeing. Great tension between Hackman and Washington. Appearing in early roles are James Gandolfini, Steve Zahn, Ryan Philippe and Daniel Von Bargen.

    First off, id like to say that if you know nothing about the military (or you hate it) you will like this movie. If you know anything about submariners, its an absolute joke. NO WAY ANY OF THIS WOULD EVER GO ON IN A NUCLEAR SUB! I was never in the military myself but I have many friends who were and I can tell you that if you bring up this movie around them they will go on for hours about how silly and contrived all the scenes in the movie are. Denzel was in his usual semi-racist (but not too racist) role. Not to mention Gene Hackman playing his usual role of the "conservative" American who is nothing more than the worst human being imaginable. Arrogant, cocky, and of course, stubborn as a mule. Has anyone else noticed that he almost always plays the same character, just different situations? Bottom line is this movie is nothing more than Hollywood liberal propaganda, using the "manly-man" Gene Hackman as their fall guy for the stereotypical evil conservative who just needs to be re-educated (and usually is) in how to be a good little socialist. If you want to see a good submarine movie, see "The hunt for Red October". Otherwise, avoid this tired piece of liberal propaganda.

    Crimson Tide is a submarine film directed by the late Tony Scott that stars Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington. It takes place during a period of political turmoil in the Russian Federation, in which ultra-nationalists threaten to launch nuclear missiles at the United States and Japan. It focuses on a clash of wills between the seasoned commanding officer (Gene Hackman) and the new executive officer (Denzel Washington) of a nuclear missile submarine, arising from conflicting interpretations of an order to launch their missiles. The film takes place during a period of instability in post-Soviet Russia. Units of the Russian military loyal to Radchenko, an ultra-nationalist, have taken control of a nuclear missile installation and are threatening nuclear war if either the American or the Russian government attempts to confront him. The United States nuclear strategic missile submarine USS Alabama is assigned a patrol mission, to be available to launch its missiles in a preemptive strike if Radchenko attempts to fuel the missiles his men have captured. Captain Frank Ramsey is the commanding officer of the sub, and one of the few commanders left in the Navy with any combat experience. He chooses as his new executive officer (XO) Lieutenant Commander Ron Hunter, who has an extensive education in military history and tactics, but no combat experience. During their initial days at sea, tensions between Ramsey and Hunter become apparent due to a clash of personalities: Hunter's more analytical, cautious approach towards his mission and the men, as opposed to Ramsey's more impulsive and intuitive approach. The Alabama eventually receives an Emergency Action Message from the National Command Authority, ordering the launch of ten of its SLBM missiles on the Russian nuclear installation, based on satellite information that the Russians' missiles are being fueled. Before the Alabama can launch, a second message arrives but is cut off by the attack of a Russian submarine friendly to Radchenko. The radio is damaged in the attack and is unable to decode the second message. With the last confirmed order being to launch, Captain Ramsey decides to proceed with the launch. Hunter refuses to concur as is procedurally required to launch, because he believes the partial second message may be a retraction. Hunter argues that the Alabama is not the only American submarine in the area, and if the order was not retracted, other submarines will launch their missiles. Ramsey argues that attack submarines may have destroyed any other American submarines and that they can't rely on someone else to carry out the order for them. Boasting taut, high energy thrills and some cracking dialogue courtesy of an uncredited Quentin Tarantino, Crimson Tide finds the late director Tony Scott near the top of his action game.It is a rare kind of war movie that not only thrills people while they're watching it, but invites them to leave the theater actually discussing the issues.And last but not the least,the performances in the film were top-notch. This is highly recommended for anyone who loves good movies.

    Crimson Tide is a must-see for anyone who likes action combined with drama or are big fans of A-list actors. Going into this movie, I expected something along the lines of The Hunt for the Red October. But what I got is a better film. This movie portrays possible real-life scenarios on whether or not submarine commanders should launch nuclear weapons. This is about a naval submarine heading to Russia to launch nuclear weapons on them. But after the radio transmission failed in the middle of the report, the captain and XO go out on each other determining what will be best thing for them to do. The acting is phenomenal. Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington are brand name actors who never do anything wrong. They are marvelous here as the captains. Overall, this is not like most thrillers. This one has a great build-up and a great ending. Also, I must note the score by Hans Zimmer. It is worth listening too. I rate this film 9/10.

    "Crimson Tide" is a 1995 film Starring Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman. The Tony Scott film involves a first officer (Washington) on a nuclear submarine who clashes with his captain (Hackman) over whether or not they have enough information to perform a first strike on a volatile Russia. As far as, Tony Scott films go, they're sort of hit or miss. I loved "Man On Fire" and "Unstoppable." However, movies like "Deja Vu" and "The Taking Of Pelham 123" are just sort of "meh" for me. This is partly because Mr. Scott made a very strange transition midway through his career. He went from using a really clean and traditional camera movement (as in "Top Gun," "True Romance," and "Crimson Tide") to using this really frenetic and trippy camera style (as in "Deja Vu," "Man On Fire," and "Unstoppable"). Sometimes the latter works, sometimes it doesn't, but one thing that usually has stayed amazingly consistent throughout Tony Scott's career is a brilliant lead performance from Denzel Washington. Tony Scott and Denzel Washington have collaborated together five times, and they've crafted some amazing stuff. "Crimson Tide" is no different here - Denzel sails through this movie with an utterly incredible finesse. However, while Denzel's performance is a force to be reckoned with, the best performance in this film is from none other than Popeye Doyle himself; Mr. Gene Hackman. His portrayal of Captain Frank Ramsey is one of the most menacing performances I've seen him give in a long while. Hackman owns this ship. In terms of directing, this movie in my opinion had everything "The Hunt For Red October" had, yet there was just a tad more. While "The Hunt For Red October" filmed it's underwater combat scenes using trick photography and models in midair, "Crimson Tide" actually shot their model ships underwater and utilized practical special effects on them regularly. While "The Hunt For Red October" had a brilliant score by Basil Poledouris, "Crimson Tide". . .had Hans Zimmer. Finally, while "The Hunt For Red October"'s plot was very interesting and definitely worth watching, "Crimson Tide" managed to be one of the most intense filmgoing experiences for me in a very long time - the fear of a nuclear holocaust is hammered into your head at an almost unsettling degree. White-knuckle film? You don't know the meaning of the term. "Crimson Tide" is an unbelievable film that I will not soon forget.

    When rebellious Russians seize control of their country's nuclear missiles, the fate of the entire free world hangs in the balance. To take care of the matter, the United States depends on a submarine in the Mediterranean Sea. The sub's captain is, according to the film's opening, one of the three most powerful men in the world (listed after the leaders of Russia and the USA). The "Alabama" is led my gun-ho veteran Gene Hackman (as Frank Ramsey). He has just hired cautious newcomer Denzel Washington (as Ron Hunter) as commander. They share an affection for horses, but do not agree on war action... The big problem occurs when Mr. Hackman and Mr. Washington interpret an "Emergency Action Message" differently. Due to a power failure, the message arrives incomplete. Hackman takes it as an order to launch a preemptive nuclear attack on Russia. Washington believes they should wait for clarity. Battle lines are drawn as the captain and commander are unable to agree... "Crimson Tide" is well-acted and nicely directed (by Tony Scott), but there is little logic or suspense. From the introduction of the co-stars, we know who is correct. Also, it's a silly movie. Washington uses pop culture to win friends and influence the crew. He lets Danny Nucci (as Rivetti) know who drew the best "Silver Surfer" and plays "Star Trek" with Lillo Brancato (as Vossler). ***** Crimson Tide (5/12/95) Tony Scott ~ Denzel Washington, Gene Hackman, George Dzundza, Viggo Mortensen

    There is a lot of ritual in the American military movies from the 90's. More than usual, that is. Crimson Tide is the story of a nuclear crisis when a crippled US submarine receives orders to fire nuclear missiles, then another partial message just before communications fail. The hardass captain (Hackman, of course) is countered in his desire to obey the launch order by the intellectual XO, played by Denzel Washington. And you have ritual in this as well: the speech before submarine launch, the wooden drills that have to happen "just so" with specific phrases and actions to reassure people they are doing the right thing. It's akin to religion and, by the very nature of the film, it makes you understand it was designed as such, transforming people into unthinking and uncaring machines. In truth, there isn't much to this movie in terms of story. The nuclear scenario is not really believable while the individual ideas in the film are simple and few. What makes the whole thing stand out is the great cast and their performance. There is some food for thought, though, because as far as the plot went, they really did receive a nuclear launch order when in all appearance, there was no need for one. That they recanted afterwards is of no relevance and perhaps a movie about that side of the story would be very interesting. Also, the ending shows that, as closed societies and fraternities often do, when a failure in their process or beliefs is found, it is quickly hidden under empty words and dirty bribes. Because even if they try to show the integrity of Hackman's character, the ending of the movie was just that: a bribe for a cover-up. As a conclusion, it is a classic film already, something that is worth watching for the sake of remembering the names of the actors in social situations alone, as James Gandolfini's character proves at the beginning of the film, and it also makes one think, if one is willing. What I found chilling is the joyful exuberance of the submarine troops when destroying the Russian one or the fanatic desire for some to follow the launch order. As Sting said, Russians love their children, too. So often in such movies, this element is completely ignored. That is what starts wars.

    Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer's 1995 film production of "Crimson Tide" has a good Submarine Dramatization Action/Thriller plot that features some intense action scenes, great cast, & excellent dialogue. The director, who made this film was Ridley Scott's younger brother Tony Scott. The film was released on May 12, 1995. The plot starts off with a news report that involves Russian rebels loyal to Vladimir Radchenko, an ultra nationalist, have hijacked a nuclear missile installation and are threatening nuclear war if either the American or Russian governments attempt to confront him. A U.S. Navy nuclear submarine, USS Alabama (SSBN-731), is assigned a mission, to be available to launch its missiles in a preemptive strike if Radchenko attempts to fuel his missiles. "The incredible Gene Hackman" portrays Captain Frank Ramsey, who is the commanding officer of USS Alabama. Before they officially start the mission, they need to hire a new X.O. and the choice that they picked is Lieutenant Commander Ron Hunter portrayed by Denzel Washington. Hunter is an expert in military history but, no combat experience. While on the way, there was an incident and Hunter had a disagreement with how Ramsey handled the plan, it's evident that Ramsey doesn't think too much of Hunter because he was college educated while Ramsey worked his way up. They're given strict commands to attack but when they were in the process of receiving another order, the ship's communications were damaged, so the whole message was not responded. Ramsey made a decision to continue with their previous order while Hunter wants to re-establish contact first. That's when the two men butt heads that ends with Hunter relieving Ramsey. Later when some men die, some of the officers feel that Hunter is not up to be in charge so they partner up to re-command control. But Hunter has taken precautions. The two then-semi-famous actors Viggo Mortensen (6 years before he portrayed the role as Aragon from The Lord of the rings trilogy) and James Gandolfini (4 years before he portrayed Italian-American crime boss Tony Soprano from the HBO crime series The Sopranos) both portrayed two supporting characters deputy Peter "Weps" Ince & Bobby Dougherty. Speaking of which, there is a cool moment in movie, when Weps, Bobby, and the rest of the crew on the bus to the submarine port were talking about old submarine movies like "The Enemy below" (1957) and "Run Silent Run Deep "(1958).They were also asking trivia question about Submarine movies each other: Weps asked Bobby who played the commander from Run Silent, Run Deep and then, Bobby answered "Cary Grant". That answer is actually wrong , it wasn't Cary Grant it was Clark Gable a.k.a The King of Hollywood , who portrayed the submarine commander from Run Silent, Run Deep. Both The Enemy Below and Run Silent, Run Deep of course made the same connection of the movie due to the same submarine film genre of those two films as they were mentioned in the film that is of course also Submarine film and that's why I find this moment of the movie to be cool. One of the deputies of the submarine, Bobby needs a little more character development. There is a realization that Bobby doesn't really have a lot of dialogue of the film but, I still think that he could be entertaining character at times. Jimmy's New Jersey accent makes his character is the main reason that make his character entertaining in the film. 36 year old James Gandolfini was still portraying supporting movie roles at the time he started in this movie. Bobby was the main deputy disagrees on Hunter taking over the submarine. I find Hans Zimmer's film score in the action scenes of the film to be very thrilling. The sounds from the orchestra, choir and synthesizer makes the film score thrilling. Hans Zimmer won a Grammy award of this film score in 1996.This film score is one of Hans Zimmer's personal favorites along with The Lion King and Gladiator. Both Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman acted out on their lead characters really well. The way that they were both taking command of submarine was serious in a intensive way. The arguments about their disagreements that they had, made it intensively serious. I highly recommend that movie for people in general and especially people, who are into submarine movies like "Das Boot". I find the movie to be "Thrilling. I give a 3 out of 4 stars.

    World War III is about to break out in the Tony Scott's movie 'Crimson Tide', when political turmoil in Russia has caused worries in United States when Russia ultra-nationalists threaten to launch nuclear missiles at them. The movie focuses on the military mission of the USS Alabama, a nuclear submarine whom duty is to launch missions back into Russia if war breaks out. The submarine is split in conflicting opinions and wills between the seasoned commanding officer Captain Frank Ramsey (Gene Hackman) and the new executive officer Lt. Ron Hunter (Denzel Washington) on the interpretations of an order to launch their missiles. In the nuclear world, the true enemy is war itself. The movie has this 'Mutiny of the Bounty' feel to it, as the audience is swept into a very plausible scenario between Hunter's more analytical, cautious approach, as opposed to Ramsey's more impulsive and intuitive approach to the mission. Great acting from both of them. I love the exchange between Hackman and Washington on the topic of Lipizzaner horses and Von Clausewitz' view of war. Indeed, all the actors have their moments to shine, including Viggo Mortensen, James Gandolfini and an excellent George Dzundza. The movie is a great suspense with an amazing music score by Hans Zimmer. The heavy use of synthesizers in place of traditional orchestral instruments sound chilling like an old Gothic church's choirs. The well-known naval hymn, "Eternal Father, Strong to Save" is given an new spin into it. It's great to note that Harry Gregson-Williams help with the bass thumbing. Great to hear on large speakers the score. The movie has excellent visuals for a smart and tense film. Now to the faults of the film, while Richard Hendrick wrote the novel, he probably knew little about submarines as a lot of the real life Navy's submariners didn't like the film. The movie had many breaches of naval protocols that it became too unrealizable to them. Example are such like Supply Officers are restricted, and cannot be put into a position to where they could take command. They don't have the training to do so. The real life Navy regulations would have Hunter disciplined for insubordination and replaced with another XO no matter what happen on the boat. Still, I like the submarine lingoes, even if I didn't understand them. Both Washington and Hackman play stereotypical roles to the point, it's seem more about a race issue between Black VS White, than an issue about launching nuclear weapons. Who brings up semi-racism likes comments like what color the most trained horse are? Was the racial subtext, necessary? The way, Denzel Washington talks to his subordinates as if they are children is a bit odd. I wouldn't have thought for once a Star Trek or a Silver Surfer reference was going to be in this type of film. Don't get me wrong, it's cool to hear it, but I would love for the movie in those scenes to be taking more serious. What part of the Navy allows a dog on submarine unless it's a K9 unit? Even if you're the captain, I doubt you can bring a dog to pee everywhere. Forget about Tide. Even Clorox could not clean up that mistake. Overall: Crimson Tide is a great movie. Worth watching.

NO WAY ANY OF THIS WOULD EVER GO ON IN A NUCLEAR SUB! I was never in the military myself but I have many friends who were and I can tell you that if you bring up this movie around them they will go on for hours about how silly and contrived all the scenes in the movie are. Denzel was in his usual semi-racist (but not too racist) role. Not to mention Gene Hackman playing his usual role of the "conservative" American who is nothing more than the worst human being imaginable. Arrogant, cocky, and of course, stubborn as a mule.

    Crimson Tide is a must-see for anyone who likes action combined with drama or are big fans of A-list actors. Going into this movie, I expected something along the lines of The Hunt for the Red October. But what I got is a better film. This movie portrays possible real-life scenarios on whether or not submarine commanders should launch nuclear weapons. This is about a naval submarine heading to Russia to launch nuclear weapons on them. But after the radio transmission failed in the middle of the report, the captain and XO go out on each other determining what will be best thing for them to do. The acting is phenomenal. Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington are brand name actors who never do anything wrong. They are marvelous here as the captains. Overall, this is not like most thrillers. This one has a great build-up and a great ending. Also, I must note the score by Hans Zimmer. It is worth listening too. I rate this film 9/10.

    "Crimson Tide" is a 1995 film Starring Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman. The Tony Scott film involves a first officer (Washington) on a nuclear submarine who clashes with his captain (Hackman) over whether or not they have enough information to perform a first strike on a volatile Russia. As far as, Tony Scott films go, they're sort of hit or miss. I loved "Man On Fire" and "Unstoppable." However, movies like "Deja Vu" and "The Taking Of Pelham 123" are just sort of "meh" for me. This is partly because Mr. Scott made a very strange transition midway through his career. He went from using a really clean and traditional camera movement (as in "Top Gun," "True Romance," and "Crimson Tide") to using this really frenetic and trippy camera style (as in "Deja Vu," "Man On Fire," and "Unstoppable"). Sometimes the latter works, sometimes it doesn't, but one thing that usually has stayed amazingly consistent throughout Tony Scott's career is a brilliant lead performance from Denzel Washington. Tony Scott and Denzel Washington have collaborated together five times, and they've crafted some amazing stuff. "Crimson Tide" is no different here - Denzel sails through this movie with an utterly incredible finesse. However, while Denzel's performance is a force to be reckoned with, the best performance in this film is from none other than Popeye Doyle himself; Mr. Gene Hackman. His portrayal of Captain Frank Ramsey is one of the most menacing performances I've seen him give in a long while. Hackman owns this ship. In terms of directing, this movie in my opinion had everything "The Hunt For Red October" had, yet there was just a tad more. While "The Hunt For Red October" filmed it's underwater combat scenes using trick photography and models in midair, "Crimson Tide" actually shot their model ships underwater and utilized practical special effects on them regularly. While "The Hunt For Red October" had a brilliant score by Basil Poledouris, "Crimson Tide". . .had Hans Zimmer. Finally, while "The Hunt For Red October"'s plot was very interesting and definitely worth watching, "Crimson Tide" managed to be one of the most intense filmgoing experiences for me in a very long time - the fear of a nuclear holocaust is hammered into your head at an almost unsettling degree. White-knuckle film? You don't know the meaning of the term. "Crimson Tide" is an unbelievable film that I will not soon forget.

    When rebellious Russians seize control of their country's nuclear missiles, the fate of the entire free world hangs in the balance. To take care of the matter, the United States depends on a submarine in the Mediterranean Sea. The sub's captain is, according to the film's opening, one of the three most powerful men in the world (listed after the leaders of Russia and the USA). The "Alabama" is led my gun-ho veteran Gene Hackman (as Frank Ramsey). He has just hired cautious newcomer Denzel Washington (as Ron Hunter) as commander. They share an affection for horses, but do not agree on war action... The big problem occurs when Mr. Hackman and Mr. Washington interpret an "Emergency Action Message" differently. Due to a power failure, the message arrives incomplete. Hackman takes it as an order to launch a preemptive nuclear attack on Russia. Washington believes they should wait for clarity. Battle lines are drawn as the captain and commander are unable to agree... "Crimson Tide" is well-acted and nicely directed (by Tony Scott), but there is little logic or suspense. From the introduction of the co-stars, we know who is correct. Also, it's a silly movie. Washington uses pop culture to win friends and influence the crew. He lets Danny Nucci (as Rivetti) know who drew the best "Silver Surfer" and plays "Star Trek" with Lillo Brancato (as Vossler). ***** Crimson Tide (5/12/95) Tony Scott ~ Denzel Washington, Gene Hackman, George Dzundza, Viggo Mortensen

    There is a lot of ritual in the American military movies from the 90's. More than usual, that is. Crimson Tide is the story of a nuclear crisis when a crippled US submarine receives orders to fire nuclear missiles, then another partial message just before communications fail. The hardass captain (Hackman, of course) is countered in his desire to obey the launch order by the intellectual XO, played by Denzel Washington. And you have ritual in this as well: the speech before submarine launch, the wooden drills that have to happen "just so" with specific phrases and actions to reassure people they are doing the right thing. It's akin to religion and, by the very nature of the film, it makes you understand it was designed as such, transforming people into unthinking and uncaring machines. In truth, there isn't much to this movie in terms of story. The nuclear scenario is not really believable while the individual ideas in the film are simple and few. What makes the whole thing stand out is the great cast and their performance. There is some food for thought, though, because as far as the plot went, they really did receive a nuclear launch order when in all appearance, there was no need for one. That they recanted afterwards is of no relevance and perhaps a movie about that side of the story would be very interesting. Also, the ending shows that, as closed societies and fraternities often do, when a failure in their process or beliefs is found, it is quickly hidden under empty words and dirty bribes. Because even if they try to show the integrity of Hackman's character, the ending of the movie was just that: a bribe for a cover-up. As a conclusion, it is a classic film already, something that is worth watching for the sake of remembering the names of the actors in social situations alone, as James Gandolfini's character proves at the beginning of the film, and it also makes one think, if one is willing. What I found chilling is the joyful exuberance of the submarine troops when destroying the Russian one or the fanatic desire for some to follow the launch order. As Sting said, Russians love their children, too. So often in such movies, this element is completely ignored. That is what starts wars.

    Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer's 1995 film production of "Crimson Tide" has a good Submarine Dramatization Action/Thriller plot that features some intense action scenes, great cast, & excellent dialogue. The director, who made this film was Ridley Scott's younger brother Tony Scott. The film was released on May 12, 1995. The plot starts off with a news report that involves Russian rebels loyal to Vladimir Radchenko, an ultra nationalist, have hijacked a nuclear missile installation and are threatening nuclear war if either the American or Russian governments attempt to confront him. A U.S. Navy nuclear submarine, USS Alabama (SSBN-731), is assigned a mission, to be available to launch its missiles in a preemptive strike if Radchenko attempts to fuel his missiles. "The incredible Gene Hackman" portrays Captain Frank Ramsey, who is the commanding officer of USS Alabama. Before they officially start the mission, they need to hire a new X.O. and the choice that they picked is Lieutenant Commander Ron Hunter portrayed by Denzel Washington. Hunter is an expert in military history but, no combat experience. While on the way, there was an incident and Hunter had a disagreement with how Ramsey handled the plan, it's evident that Ramsey doesn't think too much of Hunter because he was college educated while Ramsey worked his way up. They're given strict commands to attack but when they were in the process of receiving another order, the ship's communications were damaged, so the whole message was not responded. Ramsey made a decision to continue with their previous order while Hunter wants to re-establish contact first. That's when the two men butt heads that ends with Hunter relieving Ramsey. Later when some men die, some of the officers feel that Hunter is not up to be in charge so they partner up to re-command control. But Hunter has taken precautions. The two then-semi-famous actors Viggo Mortensen (6 years before he portrayed the role as Aragon from The Lord of the rings trilogy) and James Gandolfini (4 years before he portrayed Italian-American crime boss Tony Soprano from the HBO crime series The Sopranos) both portrayed two supporting characters deputy Peter "Weps" Ince & Bobby Dougherty. Speaking of which, there is a cool moment in movie, when Weps, Bobby, and the rest of the crew on the bus to the submarine port were talking about old submarine movies like "The Enemy below" (1957) and "Run Silent Run Deep "(1958).They were also asking trivia question about Submarine movies each other: Weps asked Bobby who played the commander from Run Silent, Run Deep and then, Bobby answered "Cary Grant". That answer is actually wrong , it wasn't Cary Grant it was Clark Gable a.k.a The King of Hollywood , who portrayed the submarine commander from Run Silent, Run Deep. Both The Enemy Below and Run Silent, Run Deep of course made the same connection of the movie due to the same submarine film genre of those two films as they were mentioned in the film that is of course also Submarine film and that's why I find this moment of the movie to be cool. One of the deputies of the submarine, Bobby needs a little more character development. There is a realization that Bobby doesn't really have a lot of dialogue of the film but, I still think that he could be entertaining character at times. Jimmy's New Jersey accent makes his character is the main reason that make his character entertaining in the film. 36 year old James Gandolfini was still portraying supporting movie roles at the time he started in this movie. Bobby was the main deputy disagrees on Hunter taking over the submarine. I find Hans Zimmer's film score in the action scenes of the film to be very thrilling. The sounds from the orchestra, choir and synthesizer makes the film score thrilling. Hans Zimmer won a Grammy award of this film score in 1996.This film score is one of Hans Zimmer's personal favorites along with The Lion King and Gladiator. Both Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman acted out on their lead characters really well. The way that they were both taking command of submarine was serious in a intensive way. The arguments about their disagreements that they had, made it intensively serious. I highly recommend that movie for people in general and especially people, who are into submarine movies like "Das Boot". I find the movie to be "Thrilling. I give a 3 out of 4 stars.

    World War III is about to break out in the Tony Scott's movie 'Crimson Tide', when political turmoil in Russia has caused worries in United States when Russia ultra-nationalists threaten to launch nuclear missiles at them. The movie focuses on the military mission of the USS Alabama, a nuclear submarine whom duty is to launch missions back into Russia if war breaks out. The submarine is split in conflicting opinions and wills between the seasoned commanding officer Captain Frank Ramsey (Gene Hackman) and the new executive officer Lt. Ron Hunter (Denzel Washington) on the interpretations of an order to launch their missiles. In the nuclear world, the true enemy is war itself. The movie has this 'Mutiny of the Bounty' feel to it, as the audience is swept into a very plausible scenario between Hunter's more analytical, cautious approach, as opposed to Ramsey's more impulsive and intuitive approach to the mission. Great acting from both of them. I love the exchange between Hackman and Washington on the topic of Lipizzaner horses and Von Clausewitz' view of war. Indeed, all the actors have their moments to shine, including Viggo Mortensen, James Gandolfini and an excellent George Dzundza. The movie is a great suspense with an amazing music score by Hans Zimmer. The heavy use of synthesizers in place of traditional orchestral instruments sound chilling like an old Gothic church's choirs. The well-known naval hymn, "Eternal Father, Strong to Save" is given an new spin into it. It's great to note that Harry Gregson-Williams help with the bass thumbing. Great to hear on large speakers the score. The movie has excellent visuals for a smart and tense film. Now to the faults of the film, while Richard Hendrick wrote the novel, he probably knew little about submarines as a lot of the real life Navy's submariners didn't like the film. The movie had many breaches of naval protocols that it became too unrealizable to them. Example are such like Supply Officers are restricted, and cannot be put into a position to where they could take command. They don't have the training to do so. The real life Navy regulations would have Hunter disciplined for insubordination and replaced with another XO no matter what happen on the boat. Still, I like the submarine lingoes, even if I didn't understand them. Both Washington and Hackman play stereotypical roles to the point, it's seem more about a race issue between Black VS White, than an issue about launching nuclear weapons. Who brings up semi-racism likes comments like what color the most trained horse are? Was the racial subtext, necessary? The way, Denzel Washington talks to his subordinates as if they are children is a bit odd. I wouldn't have thought for once a Star Trek or a Silver Surfer reference was going to be in this type of film. Don't get me wrong, it's cool to hear it, but I would love for the movie in those scenes to be taking more serious. What part of the Navy allows a dog on submarine unless it's a K9 unit? Even if you're the captain, I doubt you can bring a dog to pee everywhere. Forget about Tide. Even Clorox could not clean up that mistake. Overall: Crimson Tide is a great movie. Worth watching.

    Prior to Tony Scott's recent suicide, I hadn't seen most of his movies. But now I've seen "Crimson Tide". This portrays tension aboard a nuclear submarine when the hot-headed captain (Gene Hackman) wants to go ahead with a launch while the restrained executive officer (Denzel Washington) wants to wait for another signal. I didn't think that it was a great movie, but the context of rebel forces in Russia threatening to launch nukes brings up the issue of how secure weapons of mass destruction anywhere are, combined with the risk that a trigger-happy might ignore an incomplete message and decide to launch weapons. The point is, who can truly be considered sane in a completely insane situation? Like I said, it's not any kind of masterpiece, but still worth seeing. Great tension between Hackman and Washington. Appearing in early roles are James Gandolfini, Steve Zahn, Ryan Philippe and Daniel Von Bargen.

    First off, id like to say that if you know nothing about the military (or you hate it) you will like this movie. If you know anything about submariners, its an absolute joke. NO WAY ANY OF THIS WOULD EVER GO ON IN A NUCLEAR SUB! I was never in the military myself but I have many friends who were and I can tell you that if you bring up this movie around them they will go on for hours about how silly and contrived all the scenes in the movie are. Denzel was in his usual semi-racist (but not too racist) role. Not to mention Gene Hackman playing his usual role of the "conservative" American who is nothing more than the worst human being imaginable. Arrogant, cocky, and of course, stubborn as a mule. Has anyone else noticed that he almost always plays the same character, just different situations? Bottom line is this movie is nothing more than Hollywood liberal propaganda, using the "manly-man" Gene Hackman as their fall guy for the stereotypical evil conservative who just needs to be re-educated (and usually is) in how to be a good little socialist. If you want to see a good submarine movie, see "The hunt for Red October". Otherwise, avoid this tired piece of liberal propaganda.

    This movie shows us a few men in a submarine.They have a mission there, since there is a risk of a nuclear war started by a crazy Russian man.Two men are fighting their own personal war down there.Crimson Tide (1995) is directed by Tony Scott.Just a little time ago we heard some tragic news that this great Hollywood director has killed himself at the age of 68.One can ask whether his best work had already been done, or would it have been yet to come.Denzel Washington, who worked with Tony in five films (this being the first one), is terrific as Lt. Commander Ron Hunter.What a thrill it is to watch Gene Hackman as Captain Frank Ramsey and the battle between his and Denzel's character.Matt Craven is great as Lt. Roy Zimmer.George Dzundza is brilliant as Chief of the Boat.Viggo Mortensen is superb as Lt. Peter Ince.James Gandolfini does great work as Lt. Bobby Dougherty.Rocky Carroll plays Lt. Darik Westergard.Danny Nucci is Petty Officer Danny Rivetti.Rick Schroder plays Lt. Paul Hellerman.Steve Zahn is William Barnes.Scott Grimes is seen as Petty Officer Hilaire.Ryan Phillippe is seen as Seaman Grattam.Jason Robards is in an uncredited role playing Rear Admiral Anderson.This is a great submarine movie.You can practically feel the tension they're feeling down there.Tony Scott, you did a great job!

    Crimson Tide is a submarine film directed by the late Tony Scott that stars Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington. It takes place during a period of political turmoil in the Russian Federation, in which ultra-nationalists threaten to launch nuclear missiles at the United States and Japan. It focuses on a clash of wills between the seasoned commanding officer (Gene Hackman) and the new executive officer (Denzel Washington) of a nuclear missile submarine, arising from conflicting interpretations of an order to launch their missiles. The film takes place during a period of instability in post-Soviet Russia. Units of the Russian military loyal to Radchenko, an ultra-nationalist, have taken control of a nuclear missile installation and are threatening nuclear war if either the American or the Russian government attempts to confront him. The United States nuclear strategic missile submarine USS Alabama is assigned a patrol mission, to be available to launch its missiles in a preemptive strike if Radchenko attempts to fuel the missiles his men have captured. Captain Frank Ramsey is the commanding officer of the sub, and one of the few commanders left in the Navy with any combat experience. He chooses as his new executive officer (XO) Lieutenant Commander Ron Hunter, who has an extensive education in military history and tactics, but no combat experience. During their initial days at sea, tensions between Ramsey and Hunter become apparent due to a clash of personalities: Hunter's more analytical, cautious approach towards his mission and the men, as opposed to Ramsey's more impulsive and intuitive approach. The Alabama eventually receives an Emergency Action Message from the National Command Authority, ordering the launch of ten of its SLBM missiles on the Russian nuclear installation, based on satellite information that the Russians' missiles are being fueled. Before the Alabama can launch, a second message arrives but is cut off by the attack of a Russian submarine friendly to Radchenko. The radio is damaged in the attack and is unable to decode the second message. With the last confirmed order being to launch, Captain Ramsey decides to proceed with the launch. Hunter refuses to concur as is procedurally required to launch, because he believes the partial second message may be a retraction. Hunter argues that the Alabama is not the only American submarine in the area, and if the order was not retracted, other submarines will launch their missiles. Ramsey argues that attack submarines may have destroyed any other American submarines and that they can't rely on someone else to carry out the order for them. Boasting taut, high energy thrills and some cracking dialogue courtesy of an uncredited Quentin Tarantino, Crimson Tide finds the late director Tony Scott near the top of his action game.It is a rare kind of war movie that not only thrills people while they're watching it, but invites them to leave the theater actually discussing the issues.And last but not the least,the performances in the film were top-notch. This is highly recommended for anyone who loves good movies.

While on the way, there was an incident and Hunter had a disagreement with how Ramsey handled the plan, it's evident that Ramsey doesn't think too much of Hunter because he was college educated while Ramsey worked his way up. They're given strict commands to attack but when they were in the process of receiving another order, the ship's communications were damaged, so the whole message was not responded. Ramsey made a decision to continue with their previous order while Hunter wants to re-establish contact first. That's when the two men butt heads that ends with Hunter relieving Ramsey. Later when some men die, some of the officers feel that Hunter is not up to be in charge so they partner up to re-command control. But Hunter has taken precautions. The two then-semi-famous actors Viggo Mortensen (6 years before he portrayed the role as Aragon from The Lord of the rings trilogy) and James Gandolfini (4 years before he portrayed Italian-American crime boss Tony Soprano from the HBO crime series The Sopranos) both portrayed two supporting characters deputy Peter "Weps" Ince & Bobby Dougherty. Speaking of which, there is a cool moment in movie, when Weps, Bobby, and the rest of the crew on the bus to the submarine port were talking about old submarine movies like "The Enemy below" (1957) and "Run Silent Run Deep "(1958).They were also asking trivia question about Submarine movies each other: Weps asked Bobby who played the commander from Run Silent, Run Deep and then, Bobby answered "Cary Grant". That answer is actually wrong , it wasn't Cary Grant it was Clark Gable a.k.a The King of Hollywood , who portrayed the submarine commander from Run Silent, Run Deep. Both The Enemy Below and Run Silent, Run Deep of course made the same connection of the movie due to the same submarine film genre of those two films as they were mentioned in the film that is of course also Submarine film and that's why I find this moment of the movie to be cool. One of the deputies of the submarine, Bobby needs a little more character development. There is a realization that Bobby doesn't really have a lot of dialogue of the film but, I still think that he could be entertaining character at times. Jimmy's New Jersey accent makes his character is the main reason that make his character entertaining in the film. 36 year old James Gandolfini was still portraying supporting movie roles at the time he started in this movie. Bobby was the main deputy disagrees on Hunter taking over the submarine. I find Hans Zimmer's film score in the action scenes of the film to be very thrilling. The sounds from the orchestra, choir and synthesizer makes the film score thrilling. Hans Zimmer won a Grammy award of this film score in 1996.This film score is one of Hans Zimmer's personal favorites along with The Lion King and Gladiator. Both Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman acted out on their lead characters really well. The way that they were both taking command of submarine was serious in a intensive way. The arguments about their disagreements that they had, made it intensively serious. I highly recommend that movie for people in general and especially people, who are into submarine movies like "Das Boot". I find the movie to be "Thrilling. I give a 3 out of 4 stars.

    World War III is about to break out in the Tony Scott's movie 'Crimson Tide', when political turmoil in Russia has caused worries in United States when Russia ultra-nationalists threaten to launch nuclear missiles at them. The movie focuses on the military mission of the USS Alabama, a nuclear submarine whom duty is to launch missions back into Russia if war breaks out. The submarine is split in conflicting opinions and wills between the seasoned commanding officer Captain Frank Ramsey (Gene Hackman) and the new executive officer Lt. Ron Hunter (Denzel Washington) on the interpretations of an order to launch their missiles. In the nuclear world, the true enemy is war itself. The movie has this 'Mutiny of the Bounty' feel to it, as the audience is swept into a very plausible scenario between Hunter's more analytical, cautious approach, as opposed to Ramsey's more impulsive and intuitive approach to the mission. Great acting from both of them. I love the exchange between Hackman and Washington on the topic of Lipizzaner horses and Von Clausewitz' view of war. Indeed, all the actors have their moments to shine, including Viggo Mortensen, James Gandolfini and an excellent George Dzundza. The movie is a great suspense with an amazing music score by Hans Zimmer. The heavy use of synthesizers in place of traditional orchestral instruments sound chilling like an old Gothic church's choirs. The well-known naval hymn, "Eternal Father, Strong to Save" is given an new spin into it. It's great to note that Harry Gregson-Williams help with the bass thumbing. Great to hear on large speakers the score. The movie has excellent visuals for a smart and tense film. Now to the faults of the film, while Richard Hendrick wrote the novel, he probably knew little about submarines as a lot of the real life Navy's submariners didn't like the film. The movie had many breaches of naval protocols that it became too unrealizable to them. Example are such like Supply Officers are restricted, and cannot be put into a position to where they could take command. They don't have the training to do so. The real life Navy regulations would have Hunter disciplined for insubordination and replaced with another XO no matter what happen on the boat. Still, I like the submarine lingoes, even if I didn't understand them. Both Washington and Hackman play stereotypical roles to the point, it's seem more about a race issue between Black VS White, than an issue about launching nuclear weapons. Who brings up semi-racism likes comments like what color the most trained horse are? Was the racial subtext, necessary? The way, Denzel Washington talks to his subordinates as if they are children is a bit odd. I wouldn't have thought for once a Star Trek or a Silver Surfer reference was going to be in this type of film. Don't get me wrong, it's cool to hear it, but I would love for the movie in those scenes to be taking more serious. What part of the Navy allows a dog on submarine unless it's a K9 unit? Even if you're the captain, I doubt you can bring a dog to pee everywhere. Forget about Tide. Even Clorox could not clean up that mistake. Overall: Crimson Tide is a great movie. Worth watching.

    Prior to Tony Scott's recent suicide, I hadn't seen most of his movies. But now I've seen "Crimson Tide". This portrays tension aboard a nuclear submarine when the hot-headed captain (Gene Hackman) wants to go ahead with a launch while the restrained executive officer (Denzel Washington) wants to wait for another signal. I didn't think that it was a great movie, but the context of rebel forces in Russia threatening to launch nukes brings up the issue of how secure weapons of mass destruction anywhere are, combined with the risk that a trigger-happy might ignore an incomplete message and decide to launch weapons. The point is, who can truly be considered sane in a completely insane situation? Like I said, it's not any kind of masterpiece, but still worth seeing. Great tension between Hackman and Washington. Appearing in early roles are James Gandolfini, Steve Zahn, Ryan Philippe and Daniel Von Bargen.

    First off, id like to say that if you know nothing about the military (or you hate it) you will like this movie. If you know anything about submariners, its an absolute joke. NO WAY ANY OF THIS WOULD EVER GO ON IN A NUCLEAR SUB! I was never in the military myself but I have many friends who were and I can tell you that if you bring up this movie around them they will go on for hours about how silly and contrived all the scenes in the movie are. Denzel was in his usual semi-racist (but not too racist) role. Not to mention Gene Hackman playing his usual role of the "conservative" American who is nothing more than the worst human being imaginable. Arrogant, cocky, and of course, stubborn as a mule. Has anyone else noticed that he almost always plays the same character, just different situations? Bottom line is this movie is nothing more than Hollywood liberal propaganda, using the "manly-man" Gene Hackman as their fall guy for the stereotypical evil conservative who just needs to be re-educated (and usually is) in how to be a good little socialist. If you want to see a good submarine movie, see "The hunt for Red October". Otherwise, avoid this tired piece of liberal propaganda.

    This movie shows us a few men in a submarine.They have a mission there, since there is a risk of a nuclear war started by a crazy Russian man.Two men are fighting their own personal war down there.Crimson Tide (1995) is directed by Tony Scott.Just a little time ago we heard some tragic news that this great Hollywood director has killed himself at the age of 68.One can ask whether his best work had already been done, or would it have been yet to come.Denzel Washington, who worked with Tony in five films (this being the first one), is terrific as Lt. Commander Ron Hunter.What a thrill it is to watch Gene Hackman as Captain Frank Ramsey and the battle between his and Denzel's character.Matt Craven is great as Lt. Roy Zimmer.George Dzundza is brilliant as Chief of the Boat.Viggo Mortensen is superb as Lt. Peter Ince.James Gandolfini does great work as Lt. Bobby Dougherty.Rocky Carroll plays Lt. Darik Westergard.Danny Nucci is Petty Officer Danny Rivetti.Rick Schroder plays Lt. Paul Hellerman.Steve Zahn is William Barnes.Scott Grimes is seen as Petty Officer Hilaire.Ryan Phillippe is seen as Seaman Grattam.Jason Robards is in an uncredited role playing Rear Admiral Anderson.This is a great submarine movie.You can practically feel the tension they're feeling down there.Tony Scott, you did a great job!

    Crimson Tide is a submarine film directed by the late Tony Scott that stars Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington. It takes place during a period of political turmoil in the Russian Federation, in which ultra-nationalists threaten to launch nuclear missiles at the United States and Japan. It focuses on a clash of wills between the seasoned commanding officer (Gene Hackman) and the new executive officer (Denzel Washington) of a nuclear missile submarine, arising from conflicting interpretations of an order to launch their missiles. The film takes place during a period of instability in post-Soviet Russia. Units of the Russian military loyal to Radchenko, an ultra-nationalist, have taken control of a nuclear missile installation and are threatening nuclear war if either the American or the Russian government attempts to confront him. The United States nuclear strategic missile submarine USS Alabama is assigned a patrol mission, to be available to launch its missiles in a preemptive strike if Radchenko attempts to fuel the missiles his men have captured. Captain Frank Ramsey is the commanding officer of the sub, and one of the few commanders left in the Navy with any combat experience. He chooses as his new executive officer (XO) Lieutenant Commander Ron Hunter, who has an extensive education in military history and tactics, but no combat experience. During their initial days at sea, tensions between Ramsey and Hunter become apparent due to a clash of personalities: Hunter's more analytical, cautious approach towards his mission and the men, as opposed to Ramsey's more impulsive and intuitive approach. The Alabama eventually receives an Emergency Action Message from the National Command Authority, ordering the launch of ten of its SLBM missiles on the Russian nuclear installation, based on satellite information that the Russians' missiles are being fueled. Before the Alabama can launch, a second message arrives but is cut off by the attack of a Russian submarine friendly to Radchenko. The radio is damaged in the attack and is unable to decode the second message. With the last confirmed order being to launch, Captain Ramsey decides to proceed with the launch. Hunter refuses to concur as is procedurally required to launch, because he believes the partial second message may be a retraction. Hunter argues that the Alabama is not the only American submarine in the area, and if the order was not retracted, other submarines will launch their missiles. Ramsey argues that attack submarines may have destroyed any other American submarines and that they can't rely on someone else to carry out the order for them. Boasting taut, high energy thrills and some cracking dialogue courtesy of an uncredited Quentin Tarantino, Crimson Tide finds the late director Tony Scott near the top of his action game.It is a rare kind of war movie that not only thrills people while they're watching it, but invites them to leave the theater actually discussing the issues.And last but not the least,the performances in the film were top-notch. This is highly recommended for anyone who loves good movies.

    Crimson Tide is a must-see for anyone who likes action combined with drama or are big fans of A-list actors. Going into this movie, I expected something along the lines of The Hunt for the Red October. But what I got is a better film. This movie portrays possible real-life scenarios on whether or not submarine commanders should launch nuclear weapons. This is about a naval submarine heading to Russia to launch nuclear weapons on them. But after the radio transmission failed in the middle of the report, the captain and XO go out on each other determining what will be best thing for them to do. The acting is phenomenal. Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington are brand name actors who never do anything wrong. They are marvelous here as the captains. Overall, this is not like most thrillers. This one has a great build-up and a great ending. Also, I must note the score by Hans Zimmer. It is worth listening too. I rate this film 9/10.

    "Crimson Tide" is a 1995 film Starring Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman. The Tony Scott film involves a first officer (Washington) on a nuclear submarine who clashes with his captain (Hackman) over whether or not they have enough information to perform a first strike on a volatile Russia. As far as, Tony Scott films go, they're sort of hit or miss. I loved "Man On Fire" and "Unstoppable." However, movies like "Deja Vu" and "The Taking Of Pelham 123" are just sort of "meh" for me. This is partly because Mr. Scott made a very strange transition midway through his career. He went from using a really clean and traditional camera movement (as in "Top Gun," "True Romance," and "Crimson Tide") to using this really frenetic and trippy camera style (as in "Deja Vu," "Man On Fire," and "Unstoppable"). Sometimes the latter works, sometimes it doesn't, but one thing that usually has stayed amazingly consistent throughout Tony Scott's career is a brilliant lead performance from Denzel Washington. Tony Scott and Denzel Washington have collaborated together five times, and they've crafted some amazing stuff. "Crimson Tide" is no different here - Denzel sails through this movie with an utterly incredible finesse. However, while Denzel's performance is a force to be reckoned with, the best performance in this film is from none other than Popeye Doyle himself; Mr. Gene Hackman. His portrayal of Captain Frank Ramsey is one of the most menacing performances I've seen him give in a long while. Hackman owns this ship. In terms of directing, this movie in my opinion had everything "The Hunt For Red October" had, yet there was just a tad more. While "The Hunt For Red October" filmed it's underwater combat scenes using trick photography and models in midair, "Crimson Tide" actually shot their model ships underwater and utilized practical special effects on them regularly. While "The Hunt For Red October" had a brilliant score by Basil Poledouris, "Crimson Tide". . .had Hans Zimmer. Finally, while "The Hunt For Red October"'s plot was very interesting and definitely worth watching, "Crimson Tide" managed to be one of the most intense filmgoing experiences for me in a very long time - the fear of a nuclear holocaust is hammered into your head at an almost unsettling degree. White-knuckle film? You don't know the meaning of the term. "Crimson Tide" is an unbelievable film that I will not soon forget.

    When rebellious Russians seize control of their country's nuclear missiles, the fate of the entire free world hangs in the balance. To take care of the matter, the United States depends on a submarine in the Mediterranean Sea. The sub's captain is, according to the film's opening, one of the three most powerful men in the world (listed after the leaders of Russia and the USA). The "Alabama" is led my gun-ho veteran Gene Hackman (as Frank Ramsey). He has just hired cautious newcomer Denzel Washington (as Ron Hunter) as commander. They share an affection for horses, but do not agree on war action... The big problem occurs when Mr. Hackman and Mr. Washington interpret an "Emergency Action Message" differently. Due to a power failure, the message arrives incomplete. Hackman takes it as an order to launch a preemptive nuclear attack on Russia. Washington believes they should wait for clarity. Battle lines are drawn as the captain and commander are unable to agree... "Crimson Tide" is well-acted and nicely directed (by Tony Scott), but there is little logic or suspense. From the introduction of the co-stars, we know who is correct. Also, it's a silly movie. Washington uses pop culture to win friends and influence the crew. He lets Danny Nucci (as Rivetti) know who drew the best "Silver Surfer" and plays "Star Trek" with Lillo Brancato (as Vossler). ***** Crimson Tide (5/12/95) Tony Scott ~ Denzel Washington, Gene Hackman, George Dzundza, Viggo Mortensen

    There is a lot of ritual in the American military movies from the 90's. More than usual, that is. Crimson Tide is the story of a nuclear crisis when a crippled US submarine receives orders to fire nuclear missiles, then another partial message just before communications fail. The hardass captain (Hackman, of course) is countered in his desire to obey the launch order by the intellectual XO, played by Denzel Washington. And you have ritual in this as well: the speech before submarine launch, the wooden drills that have to happen "just so" with specific phrases and actions to reassure people they are doing the right thing. It's akin to religion and, by the very nature of the film, it makes you understand it was designed as such, transforming people into unthinking and uncaring machines. In truth, there isn't much to this movie in terms of story. The nuclear scenario is not really believable while the individual ideas in the film are simple and few. What makes the whole thing stand out is the great cast and their performance. There is some food for thought, though, because as far as the plot went, they really did receive a nuclear launch order when in all appearance, there was no need for one. That they recanted afterwards is of no relevance and perhaps a movie about that side of the story would be very interesting. Also, the ending shows that, as closed societies and fraternities often do, when a failure in their process or beliefs is found, it is quickly hidden under empty words and dirty bribes. Because even if they try to show the integrity of Hackman's character, the ending of the movie was just that: a bribe for a cover-up. As a conclusion, it is a classic film already, something that is worth watching for the sake of remembering the names of the actors in social situations alone, as James Gandolfini's character proves at the beginning of the film, and it also makes one think, if one is willing. What I found chilling is the joyful exuberance of the submarine troops when destroying the Russian one or the fanatic desire for some to follow the launch order. As Sting said, Russians love their children, too. So often in such movies, this element is completely ignored. That is what starts wars.

    Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer's 1995 film production of "Crimson Tide" has a good Submarine Dramatization Action/Thriller plot that features some intense action scenes, great cast, & excellent dialogue. The director, who made this film was Ridley Scott's younger brother Tony Scott. The film was released on May 12, 1995. The plot starts off with a news report that involves Russian rebels loyal to Vladimir Radchenko, an ultra nationalist, have hijacked a nuclear missile installation and are threatening nuclear war if either the American or Russian governments attempt to confront him. A U.S. Navy nuclear submarine, USS Alabama (SSBN-731), is assigned a mission, to be available to launch its missiles in a preemptive strike if Radchenko attempts to fuel his missiles. "The incredible Gene Hackman" portrays Captain Frank Ramsey, who is the commanding officer of USS Alabama. Before they officially start the mission, they need to hire a new X.O. and the choice that they picked is Lieutenant Commander Ron Hunter portrayed by Denzel Washington. Hunter is an expert in military history but, no combat experience. While on the way, there was an incident and Hunter had a disagreement with how Ramsey handled the plan, it's evident that Ramsey doesn't think too much of Hunter because he was college educated while Ramsey worked his way up. They're given strict commands to attack but when they were in the process of receiving another order, the ship's communications were damaged, so the whole message was not responded. Ramsey made a decision to continue with their previous order while Hunter wants to re-establish contact first. That's when the two men butt heads that ends with Hunter relieving Ramsey. Later when some men die, some of the officers feel that Hunter is not up to be in charge so they partner up to re-command control. But Hunter has taken precautions. The two then-semi-famous actors Viggo Mortensen (6 years before he portrayed the role as Aragon from The Lord of the rings trilogy) and James Gandolfini (4 years before he portrayed Italian-American crime boss Tony Soprano from the HBO crime series The Sopranos) both portrayed two supporting characters deputy Peter "Weps" Ince & Bobby Dougherty. Speaking of which, there is a cool moment in movie, when Weps, Bobby, and the rest of the crew on the bus to the submarine port were talking about old submarine movies like "The Enemy below" (1957) and "Run Silent Run Deep "(1958).They were also asking trivia question about Submarine movies each other: Weps asked Bobby who played the commander from Run Silent, Run Deep and then, Bobby answered "Cary Grant". That answer is actually wrong , it wasn't Cary Grant it was Clark Gable a.k.a The King of Hollywood , who portrayed the submarine commander from Run Silent, Run Deep. Both The Enemy Below and Run Silent, Run Deep of course made the same connection of the movie due to the same submarine film genre of those two films as they were mentioned in the film that is of course also Submarine film and that's why I find this moment of the movie to be cool. One of the deputies of the submarine, Bobby needs a little more character development. There is a realization that Bobby doesn't really have a lot of dialogue of the film but, I still think that he could be entertaining character at times. Jimmy's New Jersey accent makes his character is the main reason that make his character entertaining in the film. 36 year old James Gandolfini was still portraying supporting movie roles at the time he started in this movie. Bobby was the main deputy disagrees on Hunter taking over the submarine. I find Hans Zimmer's film score in the action scenes of the film to be very thrilling. The sounds from the orchestra, choir and synthesizer makes the film score thrilling. Hans Zimmer won a Grammy award of this film score in 1996.This film score is one of Hans Zimmer's personal favorites along with The Lion King and Gladiator. Both Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman acted out on their lead characters really well. The way that they were both taking command of submarine was serious in a intensive way. The arguments about their disagreements that they had, made it intensively serious. I highly recommend that movie for people in general and especially people, who are into submarine movies like "Das Boot". I find the movie to be "Thrilling. I give a 3 out of 4 stars.

    This movie shows us a few men in a submarine.They have a mission there, since there is a risk of a nuclear war started by a crazy Russian man.Two men are fighting their own personal war down there.Crimson Tide (1995) is directed by Tony Scott.Just a little time ago we heard some tragic news that this great Hollywood director has killed himself at the age of 68.One can ask whether his best work had already been done, or would it have been yet to come.Denzel Washington, who worked with Tony in five films (this being the first one), is terrific as Lt. Commander Ron Hunter.What a thrill it is to watch Gene Hackman as Captain Frank Ramsey and the battle between his and Denzel's character.Matt Craven is great as Lt. Roy Zimmer.George Dzundza is brilliant as Chief of the Boat.Viggo Mortensen is superb as Lt. Peter Ince.James Gandolfini does great work as Lt. Bobby Dougherty.Rocky Carroll plays Lt. Darik Westergard.Danny Nucci is Petty Officer Danny Rivetti.Rick Schroder plays Lt. Paul Hellerman.Steve Zahn is William Barnes.Scott Grimes is seen as Petty Officer Hilaire.Ryan Phillippe is seen as Seaman Grattam.Jason Robards is in an uncredited role playing Rear Admiral Anderson.This is a great submarine movie.You can practically feel the tension they're feeling down there.Tony Scott, you did a great job!

    Crimson Tide is a submarine film directed by the late Tony Scott that stars Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington. It takes place during a period of political turmoil in the Russian Federation, in which ultra-nationalists threaten to launch nuclear missiles at the United States and Japan. It focuses on a clash of wills between the seasoned commanding officer (Gene Hackman) and the new executive officer (Denzel Washington) of a nuclear missile submarine, arising from conflicting interpretations of an order to launch their missiles. The film takes place during a period of instability in post-Soviet Russia. Units of the Russian military loyal to Radchenko, an ultra-nationalist, have taken control of a nuclear missile installation and are threatening nuclear war if either the American or the Russian government attempts to confront him. The United States nuclear strategic missile submarine USS Alabama is assigned a patrol mission, to be available to launch its missiles in a preemptive strike if Radchenko attempts to fuel the missiles his men have captured. Captain Frank Ramsey is the commanding officer of the sub, and one of the few commanders left in the Navy with any combat experience. He chooses as his new executive officer (XO) Lieutenant Commander Ron Hunter, who has an extensive education in military history and tactics, but no combat experience. During their initial days at sea, tensions between Ramsey and Hunter become apparent due to a clash of personalities: Hunter's more analytical, cautious approach towards his mission and the men, as opposed to Ramsey's more impulsive and intuitive approach. The Alabama eventually receives an Emergency Action Message from the National Command Authority, ordering the launch of ten of its SLBM missiles on the Russian nuclear installation, based on satellite information that the Russians' missiles are being fueled. Before the Alabama can launch, a second message arrives but is cut off by the attack of a Russian submarine friendly to Radchenko. The radio is damaged in the attack and is unable to decode the second message. With the last confirmed order being to launch, Captain Ramsey decides to proceed with the launch. Hunter refuses to concur as is procedurally required to launch, because he believes the partial second message may be a retraction. Hunter argues that the Alabama is not the only American submarine in the area, and if the order was not retracted, other submarines will launch their missiles. Ramsey argues that attack submarines may have destroyed any other American submarines and that they can't rely on someone else to carry out the order for them. Boasting taut, high energy thrills and some cracking dialogue courtesy of an uncredited Quentin Tarantino, Crimson Tide finds the late director Tony Scott near the top of his action game.It is a rare kind of war movie that not only thrills people while they're watching it, but invites them to leave the theater actually discussing the issues.And last but not the least,the performances in the film were top-notch. This is highly recommended for anyone who loves good movies.

    Crimson Tide is a must-see for anyone who likes action combined with drama or are big fans of A-list actors. Going into this movie, I expected something along the lines of The Hunt for the Red October. But what I got is a better film. This movie portrays possible real-life scenarios on whether or not submarine commanders should launch nuclear weapons. This is about a naval submarine heading to Russia to launch nuclear weapons on them. But after the radio transmission failed in the middle of the report, the captain and XO go out on each other determining what will be best thing for them to do. The acting is phenomenal. Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington are brand name actors who never do anything wrong. They are marvelous here as the captains. Overall, this is not like most thrillers. This one has a great build-up and a great ending. Also, I must note the score by Hans Zimmer. It is worth listening too. I rate this film 9/10.

    "Crimson Tide" is a 1995 film Starring Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman. The Tony Scott film involves a first officer (Washington) on a nuclear submarine who clashes with his captain (Hackman) over whether or not they have enough information to perform a first strike on a volatile Russia. As far as, Tony Scott films go, they're sort of hit or miss. I loved "Man On Fire" and "Unstoppable." However, movies like "Deja Vu" and "The Taking Of Pelham 123" are just sort of "meh" for me. This is partly because Mr. Scott made a very strange transition midway through his career. He went from using a really clean and traditional camera movement (as in "Top Gun," "True Romance," and "Crimson Tide") to using this really frenetic and trippy camera style (as in "Deja Vu," "Man On Fire," and "Unstoppable"). Sometimes the latter works, sometimes it doesn't, but one thing that usually has stayed amazingly consistent throughout Tony Scott's career is a brilliant lead performance from Denzel Washington. Tony Scott and Denzel Washington have collaborated together five times, and they've crafted some amazing stuff. "Crimson Tide" is no different here - Denzel sails through this movie with an utterly incredible finesse. However, while Denzel's performance is a force to be reckoned with, the best performance in this film is from none other than Popeye Doyle himself; Mr. Gene Hackman. His portrayal of Captain Frank Ramsey is one of the most menacing performances I've seen him give in a long while. Hackman owns this ship. In terms of directing, this movie in my opinion had everything "The Hunt For Red October" had, yet there was just a tad more. While "The Hunt For Red October" filmed it's underwater combat scenes using trick photography and models in midair, "Crimson Tide" actually shot their model ships underwater and utilized practical special effects on them regularly. While "The Hunt For Red October" had a brilliant score by Basil Poledouris, "Crimson Tide". . .had Hans Zimmer. Finally, while "The Hunt For Red October"'s plot was very interesting and definitely worth watching, "Crimson Tide" managed to be one of the most intense filmgoing experiences for me in a very long time - the fear of a nuclear holocaust is hammered into your head at an almost unsettling degree. White-knuckle film? You don't know the meaning of the term. "Crimson Tide" is an unbelievable film that I will not soon forget.
