 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  The story begins with Spanky, who is the president of the "He-Man Woman Haters Club" with many school-aged boys from around the neighborhood as members. His best friend, Alfalfa, has been chosen as the driver for the club's prize-winning go-kart, called "The Blur", in the annual Soap Box Derby style race. However, when the announcement is made, Alfalfa is nowhere to be found. The boys catch Alfalfa in the company of Darla -- "a girl!" Alfalfa isn't like his friends because he's in love with Darla, and unfortunately threatens the very existence of their "boys only" club. The club's members try their hardest to break the two apart, eventually causing their beloved clubhouse to burn down. Darla is mistakenly led to believe Alfalfa feels ashamed of her, so she turns her attentions to Waldo, the new rich kid whose father is an oil tycoon. Further trouble ensures when their prized go-cart "The Blur" is stolen by local neighborhood bullies Butch and Woim. How can they win the big race and ...

    Granted, more than half of the children were terrible actors. Most of them sounded coached and rehearsed, the movements were for the most part awkward and very unnatural, and some of them even looked into the camera throughout most of the movie. But that's what made it relatable to Us children of the '90s. It was definitely a spin off of the "Our Gang" serious from the Depression Era, however it was made to be modern with a few familiar twists. They were '90s Kids doing what Kids do! Just like the 'Our Gang' children were Kids doing Kid things from that era!Even though there were some copies from the original in the movie, it was all in good fun. Remember, it is a CHILDREN/family movie. I grew up watching both 'The Little Rascals' and 'Our Gang' and I don't think that the Little Rascals "disgraced" 'Our Gang' in any way whatsoever. Yes, there were similarities and some "copy catting," but so what? It is after all a Children's movie about Children doing things that Children like to do in their time frame. I didn't try to get too elaborate or lengthy with this because I'm simply defending the simplicity and innocence of the movie from old cranky grown ups & sell outs.

    This movie is a heart warming tale of little children. A boy and a girl likes each other and wants to live together, same like most of the movies about love. They face a rough patch mainly due to the boy being a member of 'girl haters' club. His friends tries to help get the girl out of his life, in which they succeed. But the boy tries to get her back, who falls for a new to town rich guy. It's the same struggle of a poor guy trying to get back his girl fighting against a rich powerful opponent. As many of the stories most might have seen , the story offers nothing different than most. The only reason to watch this movie might be because it has been performed by bunch of kids, which is very beautifully put forward on screen. In the end of the story Well known celebrities are shown as the parents of the kids in the story, the facial resemblance gets us to believe they are really their children.

    Ah, the 90's remake of the Hal Roach shorts from the Great Depression. I liked this movie as a child and most other kids I knew enjoyed it too. Butas an adult I feel differently about it. Spanky (Travis Tedford) and his best friend Alfalfa (Bug Hall) are the founders of the He-Man-Woman-Haters Club, a club of little boys who get together and do "boy" things without girls. But when Alfalfa falls in puppy love with a girl named Darla (Brittany Ashton Holmes), Spanky and his other friends do everything to sabotage the relationship. And when Alfalfa accidentally burns down their clubhouse the other boys have completely had it with him, and force him to guard their prized go-cart day and night. Meanwhile, Darla has fallen for a new rich boy Waldo (Blake McIver Ewing), but Alfalfa is still determined to get her back. Everything boils down to the local fair when the boys try to win the go-cart derby, raise enough money to rebuild the clubhouse, and mend broken friendships. This movie isweak. The plot itself isn't that bad, and most children who watch it are entertained, but it's just not good. The overwhelming problem with this film is that none of the kids can act their way out of a paper bag. The fact that none of the kids have been in anything more than a few made for TV or straight to video movies since this proves that. Honestly I found the outtakes of the kids' mistakes funnier than the movie itself. In terms of being based off the original "Little Rascals" shorts, they don't have much to do with them aside from the same looks and names as the originals. That being said it's hard to relate children of the 90s to children of the 20's, 30's and 40's. A lot of the old ones are based on poverty, hunger, and child abuse as a part of their lives, along with other themes that were anachronistic or not applicable to children of the 90's. But they tried to integrate some themes like the go cart derby, Alfalfa singing and the He-Man-Woman-Haters Club. With that all said this is still a movie that would entertain most children under ten, but can quickly get annoying for parents that have to sit through it with them.

    The Little Rascals Kids today are exactly the same as kids 50 years ago. Except the mischief that modern scamps get up today involves bullying others to kill themselves. And while the tykes in this comedy aren't setting up hate websites, they do enjoy tomfoolery. The esteemed members of The He-Man Women Haters Club are dumbfounded when one of their own, Alfalfa (Bug Hall), is caught romancing Darla (Brittany Ashton Holmes). Fearful she has bewitched their star go-kart driver, Spanky (Travis Tedford), club president, sends his affiliates, Porky (Zachary Mabry) and Buckwheat (Ross Bagley), to break them up before the big race. Unfortunately, the new kid in town (Blake McIver Ewing) may beat them to it. With a capricious script, apt casting and barrels of monkeyshines, this update of the comedy shorts is stupendously goofy. Incidentally, why are these rascals running wild? Shouldn't they be at home on the couch playing video games? (Yellow Light) vidiotreviews.blogspot.com

    Although, so do I!!! I've done a lot of research about the 'Our Gang' shorts and this updated version comprises of numerous stories from 'Our Gang' rolled into one. My kid (now 3) watches on a regular basis and has me in stitches when he repeats some of the catch phrases. It's a film that parents would love to, such is the childish humour. I would have liked to have seen more 'out-takes' from the film as I know how funny kids can be! But the story line, cast and famous faces in the crowd (see Whoopi and Trump) bring the film to a whole new level. Can anyone recommend me a UK equivalent?

    I remembered watching this as a little kid and I still loved it ever since even when I'm still older. However, in my opinion, it isn't the greatest movie ever made due to it's flaws that I might point out. The story was too predictable for my taste, although it did have some nice moments with those adorable kids and the script, although decent, comes across as flat and contrived. With those flaws out of the way, there are a few saving graces. The children actors as the Rascals themselves did a good job with their roles with Bug Hall and Buckwheat (can't remember who the actor was) and Spanky stealing the show. The rich kid, Waldo, although underused, was still tolerable. I also saw some great cameos including John Goodman, Whoopi Goldberg, and Mel Brooks himself. The pacing is very brisk and helps develop our character quite well. The music's from William Ross was pretty decent, although it needs a much more elaborate depth. The best aspect is the humor. The jokes are a combination of hilarious and over-the-top at the same time (with the We Got A Dollar, The hate letter being revealed by Buckwheat and the beginning scene with Buckwheat and Porky fishing as my favorites). Overall, not the greatest movie I've seen, but still a hilarious comedy and is easily underrated. If you want to see a movie that has reminded you of your childhood life, check this one out and watch it again and again forever.

    Little Rascals is a movie that is filled with childlike grudges, wars, competition, camaraderie and reconciliation. Every great group has had to overcome obstacles in order to develop and maintain their strength. The He- Man Women Haters Club is filled with tension and animosity towards members between the group and the infamous Darla that snatched the heart of Alfalfa. Loyalty is very important to the members of the He-Man Woman Haters club. Although Alfalfa is tested and tried throughout the movie by his comrades and his childhood crush; he prevails. Spanky, the best friend of Alfalfa is infuriated by the discreet passions that his friend Alfalfa possesses for the young lady Darla. Throughout the movie, Darla and Alfalfa try to establish a bond, but they are always interrupted, whether it is by pranks of Women's Hater's Club, or rich guys such as Waldo that crept into Darla's life to take away the feelings that she had for Alfalfa. Often, in the movie the producer showed a great sense of the lack of knowledge or understanding that kids possess and how they often think without speaking. It was funny to see how the kids wanted to meet the race car driver at the end of the championship and to see how they were disgruntled because they expected to see a man. Surprisingly, the person that presented the prize to the Woman Haters Club, was the person that the gang had desired to meet along. The surprise just lied in the fact that the person was a woman and not a man. Not to mention, Spanky's disgust for women was challenged when he asked the female race car driver to give him a kiss on his cheek. Movies such as Little Rascals are rarities in 2011. Most of the films that we see today are filled with sex, violence, and theft. Even the kids are the ones committing the very acts in the movie, and it is saddening. One of my favorite movies of all time that has a similar prank-like feature assimilated into the film is "Home Alone". The movie Home Alone is filled with pranks and laughter for the entire family and if you enjoyed Little Rascals, you will probably enjoy. Home Alone.

    Films and television shows that are trying to be cute to gain laughs can be quite irritating. They often rely on the audience gaining some sort of emotional investment out of seeing an adorable baby character, or young toddler, that says lines that no young kid would say, and the usual reaction is "Aaawwww!" (Full House did this for years). These types of cinema have no reason for existence, and usually try to serve as cheap entertainment that families can enjoy together. This movie is chalk full of little children doing things children would never do, no doubt with the director feeding them lines that they don't understand because they can't read yet. But, where this film is different is it's set up. The universe that these "little rascals" live in isn't the one we live in. It's some kind of parallel universe where children own their own cars and have very elaborate clubhouses, and where very young children go on romantic dates. And never once is this particularly corny. What could be a by the numbers movie turns out to be a sort of charming little movie that is fun and funny in a surreal way. Little Alfalfa (Bug Hall) is in a group of girl-hating little boys, and they find out about his upcoming romantic date with Darla (Brittany Ashton Holmes), and they sabotage him. Meanwhile a new rich kid Waldo (Blake Ewing) has just moved in and Darla finds him quite appealing, so Alfalfa is down in the dumps. Hopefully the up-coming go-cart race is a chance for Alfalfa to get his lady back, in addition to beat Waldo, and bond with his child pal Spanky (Travis Tedford). This kids in this movie are actually all really good actors, and that's one thing that makes this movie work. Bug Hall is one of the better young actors out there, and all the ridiculous silly lines that the kids say (though kids clearly wouldn't say in real life) are said with enough conviction, yet with a clear wink from the director and writer(s). The kids say their lines well, but with a slightly over the top script, and the mixture comes off as pretty funny. The film runs at a brisk pace, with enough jokes to make up for it's overall lack of plot. The sets would have to be pretty cool looking to a child (at least they were to me!). The clubhouse that the kids built is designed to look like it was built by kids, but at the same time, it's so surreally elaborate. And this movie has plenty of surrealism and absurdest humor. Things will happen that make very little sense, but come off as hilarious because of how ridiculous the situation is. In one scene during the big race at the end, giant daggers come out of a kid's car and start stabbing another car. It's so ridiculous, but in the context of the movie, it comes off as normal in this universe, and jokes like this that might normally seem very over the top, play off quite well. If anything was unnecessary here, it was the numerous cameos that usually show up for no reason at all. A few of them were funny, but most of them seemed somewhat forced. Kids probably won't know who most of these people are anyways, so they won't understand that these are cameos. Overall, this is a very enjoyable family film, with good performances (from kids no less), and a lot of really silly jokes that hit the mark. In an average episode of Full House, I probably cringe about 10 times, but in this much longer film featuring even more kids including cameos by the Olsen Twins, there was not one moment of cringing. It's actually pretty fun. My rating: *** out of ****. 82 mins. PG for some rude humor.

    How come this movie have got only 5.6, it should be above 7.5 at least ? My rating is 10/10!!! My wife recommended this movie 3 years back. Though I must admit I was not very much interested to watch this, still rented the DVD. As soon as I start watching, immediately I came to know my wife was right. I cannot think of a single portion of a movie which can get better. The child stars are phenomenal, The storyline could get no better - I cant believe my eyes how come the kids deliver such a perfect actions - the direction just took my breath away. Its the best children movie I have ever seen and my recommendation if for all ages. Now my 1.5 years daughter also loves this one.

    OK, so these kids aren't the originals, AND I HAVE seen the original show on t.v when I was a kid in the 70s, OK so the kids AND their parents weren't dressed in present day clothes, and OK I noticed Stymie, AND Buckweat in the same movie, which was something that didn't happen in the original except once, in an episode where they had a parent and kids party at school Mary Pickford I think was there , Stymie played Buckwheats dad, up TO AND since then the 2 never met, and OK I don't believe Alfalfa would have had that hair style in 1994, it worked in the 1930s original , but hey who am I, and I thought the kids car (the blur) was cool, but no I don't ever see them making a sequel, it was for the kids only, Michael Smith

The movie Home Alone is filled with pranks and laughter for the entire family and if you enjoyed Little Rascals, you will probably enjoy. Home Alone.

    Films and television shows that are trying to be cute to gain laughs can be quite irritating. They often rely on the audience gaining some sort of emotional investment out of seeing an adorable baby character, or young toddler, that says lines that no young kid would say, and the usual reaction is "Aaawwww!" (Full House did this for years). These types of cinema have no reason for existence, and usually try to serve as cheap entertainment that families can enjoy together. This movie is chalk full of little children doing things children would never do, no doubt with the director feeding them lines that they don't understand because they can't read yet. But, where this film is different is it's set up. The universe that these "little rascals" live in isn't the one we live in. It's some kind of parallel universe where children own their own cars and have very elaborate clubhouses, and where very young children go on romantic dates. And never once is this particularly corny. What could be a by the numbers movie turns out to be a sort of charming little movie that is fun and funny in a surreal way. Little Alfalfa (Bug Hall) is in a group of girl-hating little boys, and they find out about his upcoming romantic date with Darla (Brittany Ashton Holmes), and they sabotage him. Meanwhile a new rich kid Waldo (Blake Ewing) has just moved in and Darla finds him quite appealing, so Alfalfa is down in the dumps. Hopefully the up-coming go-cart race is a chance for Alfalfa to get his lady back, in addition to beat Waldo, and bond with his child pal Spanky (Travis Tedford). This kids in this movie are actually all really good actors, and that's one thing that makes this movie work. Bug Hall is one of the better young actors out there, and all the ridiculous silly lines that the kids say (though kids clearly wouldn't say in real life) are said with enough conviction, yet with a clear wink from the director and writer(s). The kids say their lines well, but with a slightly over the top script, and the mixture comes off as pretty funny. The film runs at a brisk pace, with enough jokes to make up for it's overall lack of plot. The sets would have to be pretty cool looking to a child (at least they were to me!). The clubhouse that the kids built is designed to look like it was built by kids, but at the same time, it's so surreally elaborate. And this movie has plenty of surrealism and absurdest humor. Things will happen that make very little sense, but come off as hilarious because of how ridiculous the situation is. In one scene during the big race at the end, giant daggers come out of a kid's car and start stabbing another car. It's so ridiculous, but in the context of the movie, it comes off as normal in this universe, and jokes like this that might normally seem very over the top, play off quite well. If anything was unnecessary here, it was the numerous cameos that usually show up for no reason at all. A few of them were funny, but most of them seemed somewhat forced. Kids probably won't know who most of these people are anyways, so they won't understand that these are cameos. Overall, this is a very enjoyable family film, with good performances (from kids no less), and a lot of really silly jokes that hit the mark. In an average episode of Full House, I probably cringe about 10 times, but in this much longer film featuring even more kids including cameos by the Olsen Twins, there was not one moment of cringing. It's actually pretty fun. My rating: *** out of ****. 82 mins. PG for some rude humor.

    How come this movie have got only 5.6, it should be above 7.5 at least ? My rating is 10/10!!! My wife recommended this movie 3 years back. Though I must admit I was not very much interested to watch this, still rented the DVD. As soon as I start watching, immediately I came to know my wife was right. I cannot think of a single portion of a movie which can get better. The child stars are phenomenal, The storyline could get no better - I cant believe my eyes how come the kids deliver such a perfect actions - the direction just took my breath away. Its the best children movie I have ever seen and my recommendation if for all ages. Now my 1.5 years daughter also loves this one.

    OK, so these kids aren't the originals, AND I HAVE seen the original show on t.v when I was a kid in the 70s, OK so the kids AND their parents weren't dressed in present day clothes, and OK I noticed Stymie, AND Buckweat in the same movie, which was something that didn't happen in the original except once, in an episode where they had a parent and kids party at school Mary Pickford I think was there , Stymie played Buckwheats dad, up TO AND since then the 2 never met, and OK I don't believe Alfalfa would have had that hair style in 1994, it worked in the 1930s original , but hey who am I, and I thought the kids car (the blur) was cool, but no I don't ever see them making a sequel, it was for the kids only, Michael Smith

    Granted, more than half of the children were terrible actors. Most of them sounded coached and rehearsed, the movements were for the most part awkward and very unnatural, and some of them even looked into the camera throughout most of the movie. But that's what made it relatable to Us children of the '90s. It was definitely a spin off of the "Our Gang" serious from the Depression Era, however it was made to be modern with a few familiar twists. They were '90s Kids doing what Kids do! Just like the 'Our Gang' children were Kids doing Kid things from that era!Even though there were some copies from the original in the movie, it was all in good fun. Remember, it is a CHILDREN/family movie. I grew up watching both 'The Little Rascals' and 'Our Gang' and I don't think that the Little Rascals "disgraced" 'Our Gang' in any way whatsoever. Yes, there were similarities and some "copy catting," but so what? It is after all a Children's movie about Children doing things that Children like to do in their time frame. I didn't try to get too elaborate or lengthy with this because I'm simply defending the simplicity and innocence of the movie from old cranky grown ups & sell outs.

    This movie is a heart warming tale of little children. A boy and a girl likes each other and wants to live together, same like most of the movies about love. They face a rough patch mainly due to the boy being a member of 'girl haters' club. His friends tries to help get the girl out of his life, in which they succeed. But the boy tries to get her back, who falls for a new to town rich guy. It's the same struggle of a poor guy trying to get back his girl fighting against a rich powerful opponent. As many of the stories most might have seen , the story offers nothing different than most. The only reason to watch this movie might be because it has been performed by bunch of kids, which is very beautifully put forward on screen. In the end of the story Well known celebrities are shown as the parents of the kids in the story, the facial resemblance gets us to believe they are really their children.

    Ah, the 90's remake of the Hal Roach shorts from the Great Depression. I liked this movie as a child and most other kids I knew enjoyed it too. Butas an adult I feel differently about it. Spanky (Travis Tedford) and his best friend Alfalfa (Bug Hall) are the founders of the He-Man-Woman-Haters Club, a club of little boys who get together and do "boy" things without girls. But when Alfalfa falls in puppy love with a girl named Darla (Brittany Ashton Holmes), Spanky and his other friends do everything to sabotage the relationship. And when Alfalfa accidentally burns down their clubhouse the other boys have completely had it with him, and force him to guard their prized go-cart day and night. Meanwhile, Darla has fallen for a new rich boy Waldo (Blake McIver Ewing), but Alfalfa is still determined to get her back. Everything boils down to the local fair when the boys try to win the go-cart derby, raise enough money to rebuild the clubhouse, and mend broken friendships. This movie isweak. The plot itself isn't that bad, and most children who watch it are entertained, but it's just not good. The overwhelming problem with this film is that none of the kids can act their way out of a paper bag. The fact that none of the kids have been in anything more than a few made for TV or straight to video movies since this proves that. Honestly I found the outtakes of the kids' mistakes funnier than the movie itself. In terms of being based off the original "Little Rascals" shorts, they don't have much to do with them aside from the same looks and names as the originals. That being said it's hard to relate children of the 90s to children of the 20's, 30's and 40's. A lot of the old ones are based on poverty, hunger, and child abuse as a part of their lives, along with other themes that were anachronistic or not applicable to children of the 90's. But they tried to integrate some themes like the go cart derby, Alfalfa singing and the He-Man-Woman-Haters Club. With that all said this is still a movie that would entertain most children under ten, but can quickly get annoying for parents that have to sit through it with them.

    The Little Rascals Kids today are exactly the same as kids 50 years ago. Except the mischief that modern scamps get up today involves bullying others to kill themselves. And while the tykes in this comedy aren't setting up hate websites, they do enjoy tomfoolery. The esteemed members of The He-Man Women Haters Club are dumbfounded when one of their own, Alfalfa (Bug Hall), is caught romancing Darla (Brittany Ashton Holmes). Fearful she has bewitched their star go-kart driver, Spanky (Travis Tedford), club president, sends his affiliates, Porky (Zachary Mabry) and Buckwheat (Ross Bagley), to break them up before the big race. Unfortunately, the new kid in town (Blake McIver Ewing) may beat them to it. With a capricious script, apt casting and barrels of monkeyshines, this update of the comedy shorts is stupendously goofy. Incidentally, why are these rascals running wild? Shouldn't they be at home on the couch playing video games? (Yellow Light) vidiotreviews.blogspot.com

    Although, so do I!!! I've done a lot of research about the 'Our Gang' shorts and this updated version comprises of numerous stories from 'Our Gang' rolled into one. My kid (now 3) watches on a regular basis and has me in stitches when he repeats some of the catch phrases. It's a film that parents would love to, such is the childish humour. I would have liked to have seen more 'out-takes' from the film as I know how funny kids can be! But the story line, cast and famous faces in the crowd (see Whoopi and Trump) bring the film to a whole new level. Can anyone recommend me a UK equivalent?

    I remembered watching this as a little kid and I still loved it ever since even when I'm still older. However, in my opinion, it isn't the greatest movie ever made due to it's flaws that I might point out. The story was too predictable for my taste, although it did have some nice moments with those adorable kids and the script, although decent, comes across as flat and contrived. With those flaws out of the way, there are a few saving graces. The children actors as the Rascals themselves did a good job with their roles with Bug Hall and Buckwheat (can't remember who the actor was) and Spanky stealing the show. The rich kid, Waldo, although underused, was still tolerable. I also saw some great cameos including John Goodman, Whoopi Goldberg, and Mel Brooks himself. The pacing is very brisk and helps develop our character quite well. The music's from William Ross was pretty decent, although it needs a much more elaborate depth. The best aspect is the humor. The jokes are a combination of hilarious and over-the-top at the same time (with the We Got A Dollar, The hate letter being revealed by Buckwheat and the beginning scene with Buckwheat and Porky fishing as my favorites). Overall, not the greatest movie I've seen, but still a hilarious comedy and is easily underrated. If you want to see a movie that has reminded you of your childhood life, check this one out and watch it again and again forever.

    Little Rascals is a movie that is filled with childlike grudges, wars, competition, camaraderie and reconciliation. Every great group has had to overcome obstacles in order to develop and maintain their strength. The He- Man Women Haters Club is filled with tension and animosity towards members between the group and the infamous Darla that snatched the heart of Alfalfa. Loyalty is very important to the members of the He-Man Woman Haters club. Although Alfalfa is tested and tried throughout the movie by his comrades and his childhood crush; he prevails. Spanky, the best friend of Alfalfa is infuriated by the discreet passions that his friend Alfalfa possesses for the young lady Darla. Throughout the movie, Darla and Alfalfa try to establish a bond, but they are always interrupted, whether it is by pranks of Women's Hater's Club, or rich guys such as Waldo that crept into Darla's life to take away the feelings that she had for Alfalfa. Often, in the movie the producer showed a great sense of the lack of knowledge or understanding that kids possess and how they often think without speaking. It was funny to see how the kids wanted to meet the race car driver at the end of the championship and to see how they were disgruntled because they expected to see a man. Surprisingly, the person that presented the prize to the Woman Haters Club, was the person that the gang had desired to meet along. The surprise just lied in the fact that the person was a woman and not a man. Not to mention, Spanky's disgust for women was challenged when he asked the female race car driver to give him a kiss on his cheek. Movies such as Little Rascals are rarities in 2011. Most of the films that we see today are filled with sex, violence, and theft. Even the kids are the ones committing the very acts in the movie, and it is saddening. One of my favorite movies of all time that has a similar prank-like feature assimilated into the film is "Home Alone". The movie Home Alone is filled with pranks and laughter for the entire family and if you enjoyed Little Rascals, you will probably enjoy. Home Alone.

    I remembered watching this as a little kid and I still loved it ever since even when I'm still older. However, in my opinion, it isn't the greatest movie ever made due to it's flaws that I might point out. The story was too predictable for my taste, although it did have some nice moments with those adorable kids and the script, although decent, comes across as flat and contrived. With those flaws out of the way, there are a few saving graces. The children actors as the Rascals themselves did a good job with their roles with Bug Hall and Buckwheat (can't remember who the actor was) and Spanky stealing the show. The rich kid, Waldo, although underused, was still tolerable. I also saw some great cameos including John Goodman, Whoopi Goldberg, and Mel Brooks himself. The pacing is very brisk and helps develop our character quite well. The music's from William Ross was pretty decent, although it needs a much more elaborate depth. The best aspect is the humor. The jokes are a combination of hilarious and over-the-top at the same time (with the We Got A Dollar, The hate letter being revealed by Buckwheat and the beginning scene with Buckwheat and Porky fishing as my favorites). Overall, not the greatest movie I've seen, but still a hilarious comedy and is easily underrated. If you want to see a movie that has reminded you of your childhood life, check this one out and watch it again and again forever.

    Little Rascals is a movie that is filled with childlike grudges, wars, competition, camaraderie and reconciliation. Every great group has had to overcome obstacles in order to develop and maintain their strength. The He- Man Women Haters Club is filled with tension and animosity towards members between the group and the infamous Darla that snatched the heart of Alfalfa. Loyalty is very important to the members of the He-Man Woman Haters club. Although Alfalfa is tested and tried throughout the movie by his comrades and his childhood crush; he prevails. Spanky, the best friend of Alfalfa is infuriated by the discreet passions that his friend Alfalfa possesses for the young lady Darla. Throughout the movie, Darla and Alfalfa try to establish a bond, but they are always interrupted, whether it is by pranks of Women's Hater's Club, or rich guys such as Waldo that crept into Darla's life to take away the feelings that she had for Alfalfa. Often, in the movie the producer showed a great sense of the lack of knowledge or understanding that kids possess and how they often think without speaking. It was funny to see how the kids wanted to meet the race car driver at the end of the championship and to see how they were disgruntled because they expected to see a man. Surprisingly, the person that presented the prize to the Woman Haters Club, was the person that the gang had desired to meet along. The surprise just lied in the fact that the person was a woman and not a man. Not to mention, Spanky's disgust for women was challenged when he asked the female race car driver to give him a kiss on his cheek. Movies such as Little Rascals are rarities in 2011. Most of the films that we see today are filled with sex, violence, and theft. Even the kids are the ones committing the very acts in the movie, and it is saddening. One of my favorite movies of all time that has a similar prank-like feature assimilated into the film is "Home Alone". The movie Home Alone is filled with pranks and laughter for the entire family and if you enjoyed Little Rascals, you will probably enjoy. Home Alone.

    Films and television shows that are trying to be cute to gain laughs can be quite irritating. They often rely on the audience gaining some sort of emotional investment out of seeing an adorable baby character, or young toddler, that says lines that no young kid would say, and the usual reaction is "Aaawwww!" (Full House did this for years). These types of cinema have no reason for existence, and usually try to serve as cheap entertainment that families can enjoy together. This movie is chalk full of little children doing things children would never do, no doubt with the director feeding them lines that they don't understand because they can't read yet. But, where this film is different is it's set up. The universe that these "little rascals" live in isn't the one we live in. It's some kind of parallel universe where children own their own cars and have very elaborate clubhouses, and where very young children go on romantic dates. And never once is this particularly corny. What could be a by the numbers movie turns out to be a sort of charming little movie that is fun and funny in a surreal way. Little Alfalfa (Bug Hall) is in a group of girl-hating little boys, and they find out about his upcoming romantic date with Darla (Brittany Ashton Holmes), and they sabotage him. Meanwhile a new rich kid Waldo (Blake Ewing) has just moved in and Darla finds him quite appealing, so Alfalfa is down in the dumps. Hopefully the up-coming go-cart race is a chance for Alfalfa to get his lady back, in addition to beat Waldo, and bond with his child pal Spanky (Travis Tedford). This kids in this movie are actually all really good actors, and that's one thing that makes this movie work. Bug Hall is one of the better young actors out there, and all the ridiculous silly lines that the kids say (though kids clearly wouldn't say in real life) are said with enough conviction, yet with a clear wink from the director and writer(s). The kids say their lines well, but with a slightly over the top script, and the mixture comes off as pretty funny. The film runs at a brisk pace, with enough jokes to make up for it's overall lack of plot. The sets would have to be pretty cool looking to a child (at least they were to me!). The clubhouse that the kids built is designed to look like it was built by kids, but at the same time, it's so surreally elaborate. And this movie has plenty of surrealism and absurdest humor. Things will happen that make very little sense, but come off as hilarious because of how ridiculous the situation is. In one scene during the big race at the end, giant daggers come out of a kid's car and start stabbing another car. It's so ridiculous, but in the context of the movie, it comes off as normal in this universe, and jokes like this that might normally seem very over the top, play off quite well. If anything was unnecessary here, it was the numerous cameos that usually show up for no reason at all. A few of them were funny, but most of them seemed somewhat forced. Kids probably won't know who most of these people are anyways, so they won't understand that these are cameos. Overall, this is a very enjoyable family film, with good performances (from kids no less), and a lot of really silly jokes that hit the mark. In an average episode of Full House, I probably cringe about 10 times, but in this much longer film featuring even more kids including cameos by the Olsen Twins, there was not one moment of cringing. It's actually pretty fun. My rating: *** out of ****. 82 mins. PG for some rude humor.

    How come this movie have got only 5.6, it should be above 7.5 at least ? My rating is 10/10!!! My wife recommended this movie 3 years back. Though I must admit I was not very much interested to watch this, still rented the DVD. As soon as I start watching, immediately I came to know my wife was right. I cannot think of a single portion of a movie which can get better. The child stars are phenomenal, The storyline could get no better - I cant believe my eyes how come the kids deliver such a perfect actions - the direction just took my breath away. Its the best children movie I have ever seen and my recommendation if for all ages. Now my 1.5 years daughter also loves this one.

    OK, so these kids aren't the originals, AND I HAVE seen the original show on t.v when I was a kid in the 70s, OK so the kids AND their parents weren't dressed in present day clothes, and OK I noticed Stymie, AND Buckweat in the same movie, which was something that didn't happen in the original except once, in an episode where they had a parent and kids party at school Mary Pickford I think was there , Stymie played Buckwheats dad, up TO AND since then the 2 never met, and OK I don't believe Alfalfa would have had that hair style in 1994, it worked in the 1930s original , but hey who am I, and I thought the kids car (the blur) was cool, but no I don't ever see them making a sequel, it was for the kids only, Michael Smith

    Granted, more than half of the children were terrible actors. Most of them sounded coached and rehearsed, the movements were for the most part awkward and very unnatural, and some of them even looked into the camera throughout most of the movie. But that's what made it relatable to Us children of the '90s. It was definitely a spin off of the "Our Gang" serious from the Depression Era, however it was made to be modern with a few familiar twists. They were '90s Kids doing what Kids do! Just like the 'Our Gang' children were Kids doing Kid things from that era!Even though there were some copies from the original in the movie, it was all in good fun. Remember, it is a CHILDREN/family movie. I grew up watching both 'The Little Rascals' and 'Our Gang' and I don't think that the Little Rascals "disgraced" 'Our Gang' in any way whatsoever. Yes, there were similarities and some "copy catting," but so what? It is after all a Children's movie about Children doing things that Children like to do in their time frame. I didn't try to get too elaborate or lengthy with this because I'm simply defending the simplicity and innocence of the movie from old cranky grown ups & sell outs.

    This movie is a heart warming tale of little children. A boy and a girl likes each other and wants to live together, same like most of the movies about love. They face a rough patch mainly due to the boy being a member of 'girl haters' club. His friends tries to help get the girl out of his life, in which they succeed. But the boy tries to get her back, who falls for a new to town rich guy. It's the same struggle of a poor guy trying to get back his girl fighting against a rich powerful opponent. As many of the stories most might have seen , the story offers nothing different than most. The only reason to watch this movie might be because it has been performed by bunch of kids, which is very beautifully put forward on screen. In the end of the story Well known celebrities are shown as the parents of the kids in the story, the facial resemblance gets us to believe they are really their children.

    Ah, the 90's remake of the Hal Roach shorts from the Great Depression. I liked this movie as a child and most other kids I knew enjoyed it too. Butas an adult I feel differently about it. Spanky (Travis Tedford) and his best friend Alfalfa (Bug Hall) are the founders of the He-Man-Woman-Haters Club, a club of little boys who get together and do "boy" things without girls. But when Alfalfa falls in puppy love with a girl named Darla (Brittany Ashton Holmes), Spanky and his other friends do everything to sabotage the relationship. And when Alfalfa accidentally burns down their clubhouse the other boys have completely had it with him, and force him to guard their prized go-cart day and night. Meanwhile, Darla has fallen for a new rich boy Waldo (Blake McIver Ewing), but Alfalfa is still determined to get her back. Everything boils down to the local fair when the boys try to win the go-cart derby, raise enough money to rebuild the clubhouse, and mend broken friendships. This movie isweak. The plot itself isn't that bad, and most children who watch it are entertained, but it's just not good. The overwhelming problem with this film is that none of the kids can act their way out of a paper bag. The fact that none of the kids have been in anything more than a few made for TV or straight to video movies since this proves that. Honestly I found the outtakes of the kids' mistakes funnier than the movie itself. In terms of being based off the original "Little Rascals" shorts, they don't have much to do with them aside from the same looks and names as the originals. That being said it's hard to relate children of the 90s to children of the 20's, 30's and 40's. A lot of the old ones are based on poverty, hunger, and child abuse as a part of their lives, along with other themes that were anachronistic or not applicable to children of the 90's. But they tried to integrate some themes like the go cart derby, Alfalfa singing and the He-Man-Woman-Haters Club. With that all said this is still a movie that would entertain most children under ten, but can quickly get annoying for parents that have to sit through it with them.

    The Little Rascals Kids today are exactly the same as kids 50 years ago. Except the mischief that modern scamps get up today involves bullying others to kill themselves. And while the tykes in this comedy aren't setting up hate websites, they do enjoy tomfoolery. The esteemed members of The He-Man Women Haters Club are dumbfounded when one of their own, Alfalfa (Bug Hall), is caught romancing Darla (Brittany Ashton Holmes). Fearful she has bewitched their star go-kart driver, Spanky (Travis Tedford), club president, sends his affiliates, Porky (Zachary Mabry) and Buckwheat (Ross Bagley), to break them up before the big race. Unfortunately, the new kid in town (Blake McIver Ewing) may beat them to it. With a capricious script, apt casting and barrels of monkeyshines, this update of the comedy shorts is stupendously goofy. Incidentally, why are these rascals running wild? Shouldn't they be at home on the couch playing video games? (Yellow Light) vidiotreviews.blogspot.com

    Although, so do I!!! I've done a lot of research about the 'Our Gang' shorts and this updated version comprises of numerous stories from 'Our Gang' rolled into one. My kid (now 3) watches on a regular basis and has me in stitches when he repeats some of the catch phrases. It's a film that parents would love to, such is the childish humour. I would have liked to have seen more 'out-takes' from the film as I know how funny kids can be! But the story line, cast and famous faces in the crowd (see Whoopi and Trump) bring the film to a whole new level. Can anyone recommend me a UK equivalent?
