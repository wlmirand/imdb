    This is a deliciously fiendish film, an unusual mystery film which does not focus on plot or suspense, but on character development, on the difference in social classes. Very odd relationships evolve when a quiet young girl who seems enormously pliable is hired by a very smart, liberal woman in need of help at her isolated estate; the acting is first rate, with Sandrine Bonnaire quietly unsettling, and quirky Isabella Huppert disturbing as her friend, a nosy post office worker. The music of Mozart floats through the elegant setting where Bonnaire is hired, contrasting with the garish noise that emits from the second hand television which she has been loaned for her dark attic room; Director Chabrol assumes his audience is adult, isn't after explosions and graphic sex, but be warned that there is disturbing content in this film which might disturb some viewers

    The performances were fine, Huppert in particular was a lot of fun to watch, but the camera direction was awful, completely chilly and remote like the worst of Haneke's work. The remove and coldness, this intentional distance leaving room for judgment from the filmmaker (and the audience) rather than more fluid and closer shots encouraging closeness and empathy, really made the whole thing lackluster, at best. Also, there were some very heavy handed and poorly drawn moments used to bash us over the head with the weight of Sophie's secret. Having not read the source material, I'll reserve my opinions on the script, but it felt to me like a completely uninspired outing and can only imagine Chabrol took the job only for the money as he seemed to never find anything that interested him in the story.

    This was a masterful movie. I could relate the treatment with the earlier Chabrol movie - Masques. The movie starts off with very everyday sequences of a maid being hired into a very rich family. A post office worker befriends the maid and they start doing crazy things. For reasons of economic frustration and envy, the post office girl and the maid starts off with pranks and ends with shooting the family. The lower class is frustrated and hates the more well- off higher class. That is a truth that can arise unanticipated. The shooting scene was completely shocking. What did I find masterful? The way the movie starts off on a very everyday theme and suddenly assumes mammoth proportions and keeping the integrity. The way the movie brings out an uncomfortable overlooked truth - the truth of class hatred. The ending of the movie where the postal clerk picks up a tape recorder where the family was recording a ceremony and also ends up recording the shootout. The clerk gets killed , the cops arrive, find the tape, plays it while the maid walks out in the night. When the movie credits are being shown, the cop is playing the tape and the maid is trying to escape without being conspicuous.I don't think I have seen that kind of a scene earlier - there is a mastery to it.

    The underdogs finally have enough and, partly taken by surprise, they act. This does not happen often. In fact, as long as the underdogs have anything to preserve in their lives, it is not likely to occur but how can you be sure when that is the case? Is it the case when the rich have ten times more than the poor or is it first when they have a thousand times more and what is left for the poor is not worth having no matter how you swing it? The strong urge for justice can be suppressed, maybe even for hundreds of years if it is done intelligently with the participation of religion and whatnot. But when that doesn't function, what then? Well, this is one such "what then?". Maybe it was intended to be something else but fortunately that did not ring through too much and instead a little masterpiece was saved for posterity.

    Sandrine Bonnaire stars as the shy, odd new maid of the Lelievre family (which includes Jean-Pierre Cassel and Jacqueline Bisset). She has some big secrets. She ends up befriending the local postal clerk (Isabelle Huppert), a gossip who has a grudge against the Lelievres and has some dark secrets of her own. I quite enjoyed this film, at least for a long while. Bonnaire and Huppert are very good in it. But it really started to bug me in its shocking final act. It seems to me the whole point of it boils down to "poor people are awful." It feels like someone still had a chip on their shoulder about that whole French Revolution thing. It left just an awful taste in my mouth, and I'm not that sure I liked it at all.

    The upper-class owner of a gallery Catherine Lelievre (Jacqueline Bisset) hires the efficient and quiet maid Sophie Bonhomme (Sandrine Bonnaire) for working in the family manor in the countryside of France. Her husband Georges Lelievre (Jean-Pierre Cassel), who is an opera lover, her daughter Melinda (Virginie Ledoyen) and her teenage son Gilles (Valentin Merlet) welcome Sophie and appreciate her work. Sooner Sophie befriends the postmistress Jeanne (Isabelle Huppert), who is a bad egg and encourage Sophie to rebel against her employers, but the maid stays submissive. However, Sophie is ashamed of a secret and feels uncomfortable in many situations, finding a way to hide her secret. When Georges tells to Sophie that he does not want Jeanne in his house, Sophie stands up against him. Melinda discovers her secret and Sophie blackmails her, but Melinda tells her parents what has happened. Georges fire Sophie and she returns to the house later with Jeanne on the rampage with tragic consequences. "La C&eacute;r&eacute;monie" is one of the best films of Claude Chabrol and it is still impressive after watching for the third time sixteen years later. The unexpected violent conclusion is probably the source of inspiration for Michael Haneke's "Funny Games" of 1997. It is impossible to the viewer to be not affected by the despicable behavior of Sophie and Jeanne. My vote is nine. Title (Brazil): "Mulheres Diab&oacute;licas" ("Evil Women")

    The Lelievre family is cultured. In case you missed that there is an extended scene towards the end where the family gathers in full formal evening clothes to watch Mozart?s Don Giovanni in front of the television. Their new maid and her postal friend, not so much. Sandrine Bonnaire plays the shy, illiterate new maid under the worst haircut since Jim Carey and Jeff Daniels in ?Dumb and Dumber.? As Walt Disney has taught us, beware of those with bad hair and teeth - they are the bad guys. Sophie and Isabelle Hubert as the postal Jeanne spend the first 95 minutes of the film building a Thelma and Louise feminist empowerment through senseless violence relationship which finally boils over in the last extended scene. Although the film suggests both characters have come to their present positions after murdering an employer and a daughter respectively in their past lives the long, slow build-up to the fin does not give enough hints to make the naked violence they eventually commit seem keeping in character. The Lelievres, including the radiant Jacqueline Bisset, are neither snooty enough to give a sense of schadenfreude when the inevitable happens or likable enough that we are rooting for them to expunge Sophie before it is too late. In short, this is a slow boil in the extreme, nearly nothing happens in the first 50 minutes and when it finally does, we are not emotionally committed enough to care.

    Elegant and sophisticated Catherine Lelievre is in a bind. She has been without a housekeeper for quite some time. The prospect of getting someone to come work in her suburban home as a live-in maid, appears to be Sophie, a young woman she interviews for the job as the story begins. The quiet Sophie shows promise, although Catherine does not emphasize she is taking her on a trial basis. Sophie turns out to be a terrific worker and a good cook to boot. There is one problem though, we realize she is an illiterate young woman who cannot read. Little written reminders pose a threat to her because she has no idea what is being asked for her to do. The generous LeLIevres offer to pay for her driving lessons, something she refuses because she has bad eyes. No problem, they will pay for an eye checkup! One day Sophie meets Jeanne, a woman that is a gossip and a snoop. She has the perfect job working at the post office where she is able to open the mail to her heart's content. Jeanne sees in Sophie a kindred spirit. What's more, she has discovered a secret the Lelievre's maid has told no one. Sophie was involved in a fire in the house where she was living with her older infirm father, who died in the sinister. Sophie, who might have done the deed, is not accused of anything. Yet Jeanne knows about it. Jeanne, a woman with a shady past, becomes Sophie's ally. In the meantime, things begin to change somewhat for Sophie at the Lelievres. One day, she decides to leave Catherine to fend for herself during a birthday party at the house because she must go out with Jeanne. Daughter Melinda discovers the problem with Sophie. Thinking the maid is dyslexic, she offers to help her, but Sophie overreacts by telling Melinda she knows she is hiding her pregnancy from her parents. Georges Lelievre finally explodes when he learns that Jeanne, the woman that has been reading his correspondence is being entertained at his house by Sophie. He fires her, but lets her stay for a few days. A bad decision that will backfire on him and the family. Jeanne, clearly upset by not being able to come to the house, visits one night as the family prepares to watch "Don Giovanni" on a televised broadcast which they are also recording on a portable device. That visit comes with terrible consequences for all the people involved. Claude Chabrol's adapted Ruth Rendell's novel "A Judgment in Stone" with Caroline Eliacheff, transferring the locale from England to his beloved Brittany. The adapters put more emphasis on the class differences between the well-to-do Lelievres and Sophie, even though the employers were more than generous. The novel had another flavor, but for those that have not read the original text, this is a wonderful way to get acquainted with the Ruth Rendell work. In fact, having read the novel years before the film came out, we went back to reread it after we watched the film. Sandrine Bonnaire is quite a contrast for the original Eunice Parchman. In the novel, Eunice is a vulgar woman whose attitude toward any kindness the people she worked for bestowed on her was received with resentment. The Sophie in the film version shows a more sophisticated approach, in comparison with Eunice. Ms. Bonnaire, one of France's leading actresses does what the director wanted of her, but it is hard to believe her Sophie could be illiterate. Working with Isabelle Huppert came easy for Claude Chabrol, after all, they collaborated a lot in the films they did together. Some of Ms. Huppert's best work can be seen in films directed by Chabrol. Jacqueline Bisset and Jean-Pierre Cassel are wonderful as the Lelievres. Virginie Ledoyen and Valentin Merlet play Melinda and Gilles respectively. Bernard Zitzermann's camera photographs the area in vivid detail, enhancing the film. The music score is by Matthieu Chabrol, the son of the director, a frequent collaborator.

    The duet Jeanne-Sophie, like the one of "Natural born killers", is one difficult to understand from "normality", but in the hands of two gifted actresses and a malevolent script, it is so believable it rises to perfection. I see no drawbacks in this charming gem. Of course the Lelievre family deserves accolades for being so haughty and predictable, we all know or have befriended people like them. Georges overacts a bit, but is so funny one forgives him. Jacqueline Bisset, we all know it, is one of the most elegant women on earth, which makes her fit to her role like a comfortable glove, or one of her splendid dresses worn by her. Just as beautiful Virginie Ledoyen, from "En plein coeur" among others, plays here a character completely different from the aforementioned film, a rebellious daughter with a social conscience. Dr. Cleckley on his famous treatise on psychopathy, "Mask of sanity", writes about how a schizophrenic can be used/ predated by a psychopath who uses her as a "muscle" to do the criminal acts, while she masterminds everything. Having watched the film again, it is my contention we witness an alliance of the sort in this film. Use of classical music is intelligent: you'll never listen to Mozart's Don Giovanni or Britten's Cello Concerto again without remembering this film and probably, feeling some tension (if you're like me at least). My favourite character is the Priest. Like in most Chabrol's films, you can expect his portrayal of the church to be far from unbiased, but in this case at least it's so ridiculous it's funny. Watch his spectacles, and pompous way of talking and you can almost see old man Chabrol winking at us. I agree with IMDb reviewer epeck15 that Sandrine's "jerky and stiff physical mannerisms" plus that "we can also feel her almost childlike panic" creates a bond that's hard to forget afterwards. He/ she mentions sociopathy twice in the review too. Watch twice at least, leaving some time in between. Like a sip of fine Indian tea, this film only gets better each time you view it.

    A rich French family hires a mousy maid who has some peculiar traits. It starts out as a nice character study, with Bonnaire creating a sympathetic figure as a young woman who struggles with her illiteracy but is too ashamed to to let anyone know about it. In the last act, however, the film goes south, turning into a silly thriller. The ending is particularly contrived and ridiculous. Bonnaire is quite good as the maid, as is Bisset (speaking in French) as her kindly employer. In fact the whole cast is fine. Chabrol is regarded as the French Hitchcock, but he lacks the master's skill for building suspense with wit and subtlety.

Some of Ms. Huppert's best work can be seen in films directed by Chabrol. Jacqueline Bisset and Jean-Pierre Cassel are wonderful as the Lelievres. Virginie Ledoyen and Valentin Merlet play Melinda and Gilles respectively. Bernard Zitzermann's camera photographs the area in vivid detail, enhancing the film. The music score is by Matthieu Chabrol, the son of the director, a frequent collaborator.

    The duet Jeanne-Sophie, like the one of "Natural born killers", is one difficult to understand from "normality", but in the hands of two gifted actresses and a malevolent script, it is so believable it rises to perfection. I see no drawbacks in this charming gem. Of course the Lelievre family deserves accolades for being so haughty and predictable, we all know or have befriended people like them. Georges overacts a bit, but is so funny one forgives him. Jacqueline Bisset, we all know it, is one of the most elegant women on earth, which makes her fit to her role like a comfortable glove, or one of her splendid dresses worn by her. Just as beautiful Virginie Ledoyen, from "En plein coeur" among others, plays here a character completely different from the aforementioned film, a rebellious daughter with a social conscience. Dr. Cleckley on his famous treatise on psychopathy, "Mask of sanity", writes about how a schizophrenic can be used/ predated by a psychopath who uses her as a "muscle" to do the criminal acts, while she masterminds everything. Having watched the film again, it is my contention we witness an alliance of the sort in this film. Use of classical music is intelligent: you'll never listen to Mozart's Don Giovanni or Britten's Cello Concerto again without remembering this film and probably, feeling some tension (if you're like me at least). My favourite character is the Priest. Like in most Chabrol's films, you can expect his portrayal of the church to be far from unbiased, but in this case at least it's so ridiculous it's funny. Watch his spectacles, and pompous way of talking and you can almost see old man Chabrol winking at us. I agree with IMDb reviewer epeck15 that Sandrine's "jerky and stiff physical mannerisms" plus that "we can also feel her almost childlike panic" creates a bond that's hard to forget afterwards. He/ she mentions sociopathy twice in the review too. Watch twice at least, leaving some time in between. Like a sip of fine Indian tea, this film only gets better each time you view it.

    A rich French family hires a mousy maid who has some peculiar traits. It starts out as a nice character study, with Bonnaire creating a sympathetic figure as a young woman who struggles with her illiteracy but is too ashamed to to let anyone know about it. In the last act, however, the film goes south, turning into a silly thriller. The ending is particularly contrived and ridiculous. Bonnaire is quite good as the maid, as is Bisset (speaking in French) as her kindly employer. In fact the whole cast is fine. Chabrol is regarded as the French Hitchcock, but he lacks the master's skill for building suspense with wit and subtlety.

    This is a deliciously fiendish film, an unusual mystery film which does not focus on plot or suspense, but on character development, on the difference in social classes. Very odd relationships evolve when a quiet young girl who seems enormously pliable is hired by a very smart, liberal woman in need of help at her isolated estate; the acting is first rate, with Sandrine Bonnaire quietly unsettling, and quirky Isabella Huppert disturbing as her friend, a nosy post office worker. The music of Mozart floats through the elegant setting where Bonnaire is hired, contrasting with the garish noise that emits from the second hand television which she has been loaned for her dark attic room; Director Chabrol assumes his audience is adult, isn't after explosions and graphic sex, but be warned that there is disturbing content in this film which might disturb some viewers

    The performances were fine, Huppert in particular was a lot of fun to watch, but the camera direction was awful, completely chilly and remote like the worst of Haneke's work. The remove and coldness, this intentional distance leaving room for judgment from the filmmaker (and the audience) rather than more fluid and closer shots encouraging closeness and empathy, really made the whole thing lackluster, at best. Also, there were some very heavy handed and poorly drawn moments used to bash us over the head with the weight of Sophie's secret. Having not read the source material, I'll reserve my opinions on the script, but it felt to me like a completely uninspired outing and can only imagine Chabrol took the job only for the money as he seemed to never find anything that interested him in the story.

    This was a masterful movie. I could relate the treatment with the earlier Chabrol movie - Masques. The movie starts off with very everyday sequences of a maid being hired into a very rich family. A post office worker befriends the maid and they start doing crazy things. For reasons of economic frustration and envy, the post office girl and the maid starts off with pranks and ends with shooting the family. The lower class is frustrated and hates the more well- off higher class. That is a truth that can arise unanticipated. The shooting scene was completely shocking. What did I find masterful? The way the movie starts off on a very everyday theme and suddenly assumes mammoth proportions and keeping the integrity. The way the movie brings out an uncomfortable overlooked truth - the truth of class hatred. The ending of the movie where the postal clerk picks up a tape recorder where the family was recording a ceremony and also ends up recording the shootout. The clerk gets killed , the cops arrive, find the tape, plays it while the maid walks out in the night. When the movie credits are being shown, the cop is playing the tape and the maid is trying to escape without being conspicuous.I don't think I have seen that kind of a scene earlier - there is a mastery to it.

    The underdogs finally have enough and, partly taken by surprise, they act. This does not happen often. In fact, as long as the underdogs have anything to preserve in their lives, it is not likely to occur but how can you be sure when that is the case? Is it the case when the rich have ten times more than the poor or is it first when they have a thousand times more and what is left for the poor is not worth having no matter how you swing it? The strong urge for justice can be suppressed, maybe even for hundreds of years if it is done intelligently with the participation of religion and whatnot. But when that doesn't function, what then? Well, this is one such "what then?". Maybe it was intended to be something else but fortunately that did not ring through too much and instead a little masterpiece was saved for posterity.

    Sandrine Bonnaire stars as the shy, odd new maid of the Lelievre family (which includes Jean-Pierre Cassel and Jacqueline Bisset). She has some big secrets. She ends up befriending the local postal clerk (Isabelle Huppert), a gossip who has a grudge against the Lelievres and has some dark secrets of her own. I quite enjoyed this film, at least for a long while. Bonnaire and Huppert are very good in it. But it really started to bug me in its shocking final act. It seems to me the whole point of it boils down to "poor people are awful." It feels like someone still had a chip on their shoulder about that whole French Revolution thing. It left just an awful taste in my mouth, and I'm not that sure I liked it at all.

    The upper-class owner of a gallery Catherine Lelievre (Jacqueline Bisset) hires the efficient and quiet maid Sophie Bonhomme (Sandrine Bonnaire) for working in the family manor in the countryside of France. Her husband Georges Lelievre (Jean-Pierre Cassel), who is an opera lover, her daughter Melinda (Virginie Ledoyen) and her teenage son Gilles (Valentin Merlet) welcome Sophie and appreciate her work. Sooner Sophie befriends the postmistress Jeanne (Isabelle Huppert), who is a bad egg and encourage Sophie to rebel against her employers, but the maid stays submissive. However, Sophie is ashamed of a secret and feels uncomfortable in many situations, finding a way to hide her secret. When Georges tells to Sophie that he does not want Jeanne in his house, Sophie stands up against him. Melinda discovers her secret and Sophie blackmails her, but Melinda tells her parents what has happened. Georges fire Sophie and she returns to the house later with Jeanne on the rampage with tragic consequences. "La C&eacute;r&eacute;monie" is one of the best films of Claude Chabrol and it is still impressive after watching for the third time sixteen years later. The unexpected violent conclusion is probably the source of inspiration for Michael Haneke's "Funny Games" of 1997. It is impossible to the viewer to be not affected by the despicable behavior of Sophie and Jeanne. My vote is nine. Title (Brazil): "Mulheres Diab&oacute;licas" ("Evil Women")

    The Lelievre family is cultured. In case you missed that there is an extended scene towards the end where the family gathers in full formal evening clothes to watch Mozart?s Don Giovanni in front of the television. Their new maid and her postal friend, not so much. Sandrine Bonnaire plays the shy, illiterate new maid under the worst haircut since Jim Carey and Jeff Daniels in ?Dumb and Dumber.? As Walt Disney has taught us, beware of those with bad hair and teeth - they are the bad guys. Sophie and Isabelle Hubert as the postal Jeanne spend the first 95 minutes of the film building a Thelma and Louise feminist empowerment through senseless violence relationship which finally boils over in the last extended scene. Although the film suggests both characters have come to their present positions after murdering an employer and a daughter respectively in their past lives the long, slow build-up to the fin does not give enough hints to make the naked violence they eventually commit seem keeping in character. The Lelievres, including the radiant Jacqueline Bisset, are neither snooty enough to give a sense of schadenfreude when the inevitable happens or likable enough that we are rooting for them to expunge Sophie before it is too late. In short, this is a slow boil in the extreme, nearly nothing happens in the first 50 minutes and when it finally does, we are not emotionally committed enough to care.

    Elegant and sophisticated Catherine Lelievre is in a bind. She has been without a housekeeper for quite some time. The prospect of getting someone to come work in her suburban home as a live-in maid, appears to be Sophie, a young woman she interviews for the job as the story begins. The quiet Sophie shows promise, although Catherine does not emphasize she is taking her on a trial basis. Sophie turns out to be a terrific worker and a good cook to boot. There is one problem though, we realize she is an illiterate young woman who cannot read. Little written reminders pose a threat to her because she has no idea what is being asked for her to do. The generous LeLIevres offer to pay for her driving lessons, something she refuses because she has bad eyes. No problem, they will pay for an eye checkup! One day Sophie meets Jeanne, a woman that is a gossip and a snoop. She has the perfect job working at the post office where she is able to open the mail to her heart's content. Jeanne sees in Sophie a kindred spirit. What's more, she has discovered a secret the Lelievre's maid has told no one. Sophie was involved in a fire in the house where she was living with her older infirm father, who died in the sinister. Sophie, who might have done the deed, is not accused of anything. Yet Jeanne knows about it. Jeanne, a woman with a shady past, becomes Sophie's ally. In the meantime, things begin to change somewhat for Sophie at the Lelievres. One day, she decides to leave Catherine to fend for herself during a birthday party at the house because she must go out with Jeanne. Daughter Melinda discovers the problem with Sophie. Thinking the maid is dyslexic, she offers to help her, but Sophie overreacts by telling Melinda she knows she is hiding her pregnancy from her parents. Georges Lelievre finally explodes when he learns that Jeanne, the woman that has been reading his correspondence is being entertained at his house by Sophie. He fires her, but lets her stay for a few days. A bad decision that will backfire on him and the family. Jeanne, clearly upset by not being able to come to the house, visits one night as the family prepares to watch "Don Giovanni" on a televised broadcast which they are also recording on a portable device. That visit comes with terrible consequences for all the people involved. Claude Chabrol's adapted Ruth Rendell's novel "A Judgment in Stone" with Caroline Eliacheff, transferring the locale from England to his beloved Brittany. The adapters put more emphasis on the class differences between the well-to-do Lelievres and Sophie, even though the employers were more than generous. The novel had another flavor, but for those that have not read the original text, this is a wonderful way to get acquainted with the Ruth Rendell work. In fact, having read the novel years before the film came out, we went back to reread it after we watched the film. Sandrine Bonnaire is quite a contrast for the original Eunice Parchman. In the novel, Eunice is a vulgar woman whose attitude toward any kindness the people she worked for bestowed on her was received with resentment. The Sophie in the film version shows a more sophisticated approach, in comparison with Eunice. Ms. Bonnaire, one of France's leading actresses does what the director wanted of her, but it is hard to believe her Sophie could be illiterate. Working with Isabelle Huppert came easy for Claude Chabrol, after all, they collaborated a lot in the films they did together. Some of Ms. Huppert's best work can be seen in films directed by Chabrol. Jacqueline Bisset and Jean-Pierre Cassel are wonderful as the Lelievres. Virginie Ledoyen and Valentin Merlet play Melinda and Gilles respectively. Bernard Zitzermann's camera photographs the area in vivid detail, enhancing the film.

He fires her, but lets her stay for a few days. A bad decision that will backfire on him and the family. Jeanne, clearly upset by not being able to come to the house, visits one night as the family prepares to watch "Don Giovanni" on a televised broadcast which they are also recording on a portable device. That visit comes with terrible consequences for all the people involved. Claude Chabrol's adapted Ruth Rendell's novel "A Judgment in Stone" with Caroline Eliacheff, transferring the locale from England to his beloved Brittany. The adapters put more emphasis on the class differences between the well-to-do Lelievres and Sophie, even though the employers were more than generous. The novel had another flavor, but for those that have not read the original text, this is a wonderful way to get acquainted with the Ruth Rendell work. In fact, having read the novel years before the film came out, we went back to reread it after we watched the film. Sandrine Bonnaire is quite a contrast for the original Eunice Parchman. In the novel, Eunice is a vulgar woman whose attitude toward any kindness the people she worked for bestowed on her was received with resentment. The Sophie in the film version shows a more sophisticated approach, in comparison with Eunice. Ms. Bonnaire, one of France's leading actresses does what the director wanted of her, but it is hard to believe her Sophie could be illiterate. Working with Isabelle Huppert came easy for Claude Chabrol, after all, they collaborated a lot in the films they did together. Some of Ms. Huppert's best work can be seen in films directed by Chabrol. Jacqueline Bisset and Jean-Pierre Cassel are wonderful as the Lelievres. Virginie Ledoyen and Valentin Merlet play Melinda and Gilles respectively. Bernard Zitzermann's camera photographs the area in vivid detail, enhancing the film. The music score is by Matthieu Chabrol, the son of the director, a frequent collaborator.

    The duet Jeanne-Sophie, like the one of "Natural born killers", is one difficult to understand from "normality", but in the hands of two gifted actresses and a malevolent script, it is so believable it rises to perfection. I see no drawbacks in this charming gem. Of course the Lelievre family deserves accolades for being so haughty and predictable, we all know or have befriended people like them. Georges overacts a bit, but is so funny one forgives him. Jacqueline Bisset, we all know it, is one of the most elegant women on earth, which makes her fit to her role like a comfortable glove, or one of her splendid dresses worn by her. Just as beautiful Virginie Ledoyen, from "En plein coeur" among others, plays here a character completely different from the aforementioned film, a rebellious daughter with a social conscience. Dr. Cleckley on his famous treatise on psychopathy, "Mask of sanity", writes about how a schizophrenic can be used/ predated by a psychopath who uses her as a "muscle" to do the criminal acts, while she masterminds everything. Having watched the film again, it is my contention we witness an alliance of the sort in this film. Use of classical music is intelligent: you'll never listen to Mozart's Don Giovanni or Britten's Cello Concerto again without remembering this film and probably, feeling some tension (if you're like me at least). My favourite character is the Priest. Like in most Chabrol's films, you can expect his portrayal of the church to be far from unbiased, but in this case at least it's so ridiculous it's funny. Watch his spectacles, and pompous way of talking and you can almost see old man Chabrol winking at us. I agree with IMDb reviewer epeck15 that Sandrine's "jerky and stiff physical mannerisms" plus that "we can also feel her almost childlike panic" creates a bond that's hard to forget afterwards. He/ she mentions sociopathy twice in the review too. Watch twice at least, leaving some time in between. Like a sip of fine Indian tea, this film only gets better each time you view it.

    A rich French family hires a mousy maid who has some peculiar traits. It starts out as a nice character study, with Bonnaire creating a sympathetic figure as a young woman who struggles with her illiteracy but is too ashamed to to let anyone know about it. In the last act, however, the film goes south, turning into a silly thriller. The ending is particularly contrived and ridiculous. Bonnaire is quite good as the maid, as is Bisset (speaking in French) as her kindly employer. In fact the whole cast is fine. Chabrol is regarded as the French Hitchcock, but he lacks the master's skill for building suspense with wit and subtlety.

    This is a deliciously fiendish film, an unusual mystery film which does not focus on plot or suspense, but on character development, on the difference in social classes. Very odd relationships evolve when a quiet young girl who seems enormously pliable is hired by a very smart, liberal woman in need of help at her isolated estate; the acting is first rate, with Sandrine Bonnaire quietly unsettling, and quirky Isabella Huppert disturbing as her friend, a nosy post office worker. The music of Mozart floats through the elegant setting where Bonnaire is hired, contrasting with the garish noise that emits from the second hand television which she has been loaned for her dark attic room; Director Chabrol assumes his audience is adult, isn't after explosions and graphic sex, but be warned that there is disturbing content in this film which might disturb some viewers

    The performances were fine, Huppert in particular was a lot of fun to watch, but the camera direction was awful, completely chilly and remote like the worst of Haneke's work. The remove and coldness, this intentional distance leaving room for judgment from the filmmaker (and the audience) rather than more fluid and closer shots encouraging closeness and empathy, really made the whole thing lackluster, at best. Also, there were some very heavy handed and poorly drawn moments used to bash us over the head with the weight of Sophie's secret. Having not read the source material, I'll reserve my opinions on the script, but it felt to me like a completely uninspired outing and can only imagine Chabrol took the job only for the money as he seemed to never find anything that interested him in the story.

    This was a masterful movie. I could relate the treatment with the earlier Chabrol movie - Masques. The movie starts off with very everyday sequences of a maid being hired into a very rich family. A post office worker befriends the maid and they start doing crazy things. For reasons of economic frustration and envy, the post office girl and the maid starts off with pranks and ends with shooting the family. The lower class is frustrated and hates the more well- off higher class. That is a truth that can arise unanticipated. The shooting scene was completely shocking. What did I find masterful? The way the movie starts off on a very everyday theme and suddenly assumes mammoth proportions and keeping the integrity. The way the movie brings out an uncomfortable overlooked truth - the truth of class hatred. The ending of the movie where the postal clerk picks up a tape recorder where the family was recording a ceremony and also ends up recording the shootout. The clerk gets killed , the cops arrive, find the tape, plays it while the maid walks out in the night. When the movie credits are being shown, the cop is playing the tape and the maid is trying to escape without being conspicuous.I don't think I have seen that kind of a scene earlier - there is a mastery to it.

    The underdogs finally have enough and, partly taken by surprise, they act. This does not happen often. In fact, as long as the underdogs have anything to preserve in their lives, it is not likely to occur but how can you be sure when that is the case? Is it the case when the rich have ten times more than the poor or is it first when they have a thousand times more and what is left for the poor is not worth having no matter how you swing it? The strong urge for justice can be suppressed, maybe even for hundreds of years if it is done intelligently with the participation of religion and whatnot. But when that doesn't function, what then? Well, this is one such "what then?". Maybe it was intended to be something else but fortunately that did not ring through too much and instead a little masterpiece was saved for posterity.

    Sandrine Bonnaire stars as the shy, odd new maid of the Lelievre family (which includes Jean-Pierre Cassel and Jacqueline Bisset). She has some big secrets. She ends up befriending the local postal clerk (Isabelle Huppert), a gossip who has a grudge against the Lelievres and has some dark secrets of her own. I quite enjoyed this film, at least for a long while. Bonnaire and Huppert are very good in it. But it really started to bug me in its shocking final act. It seems to me the whole point of it boils down to "poor people are awful." It feels like someone still had a chip on their shoulder about that whole French Revolution thing. It left just an awful taste in my mouth, and I'm not that sure I liked it at all.

    The upper-class owner of a gallery Catherine Lelievre (Jacqueline Bisset) hires the efficient and quiet maid Sophie Bonhomme (Sandrine Bonnaire) for working in the family manor in the countryside of France. Her husband Georges Lelievre (Jean-Pierre Cassel), who is an opera lover, her daughter Melinda (Virginie Ledoyen) and her teenage son Gilles (Valentin Merlet) welcome Sophie and appreciate her work. Sooner Sophie befriends the postmistress Jeanne (Isabelle Huppert), who is a bad egg and encourage Sophie to rebel against her employers, but the maid stays submissive. However, Sophie is ashamed of a secret and feels uncomfortable in many situations, finding a way to hide her secret. When Georges tells to Sophie that he does not want Jeanne in his house, Sophie stands up against him. Melinda discovers her secret and Sophie blackmails her, but Melinda tells her parents what has happened. Georges fire Sophie and she returns to the house later with Jeanne on the rampage with tragic consequences. "La C&eacute;r&eacute;monie" is one of the best films of Claude Chabrol and it is still impressive after watching for the third time sixteen years later. The unexpected violent conclusion is probably the source of inspiration for Michael Haneke's "Funny Games" of 1997. It is impossible to the viewer to be not affected by the despicable behavior of Sophie and Jeanne. My vote is nine. Title (Brazil): "Mulheres Diab&oacute;licas" ("Evil Women")

    The Lelievre family is cultured. In case you missed that there is an extended scene towards the end where the family gathers in full formal evening clothes to watch Mozart?s Don Giovanni in front of the television. Their new maid and her postal friend, not so much. Sandrine Bonnaire plays the shy, illiterate new maid under the worst haircut since Jim Carey and Jeff Daniels in ?Dumb and Dumber.? As Walt Disney has taught us, beware of those with bad hair and teeth - they are the bad guys. Sophie and Isabelle Hubert as the postal Jeanne spend the first 95 minutes of the film building a Thelma and Louise feminist empowerment through senseless violence relationship which finally boils over in the last extended scene. Although the film suggests both characters have come to their present positions after murdering an employer and a daughter respectively in their past lives the long, slow build-up to the fin does not give enough hints to make the naked violence they eventually commit seem keeping in character. The Lelievres, including the radiant Jacqueline Bisset, are neither snooty enough to give a sense of schadenfreude when the inevitable happens or likable enough that we are rooting for them to expunge Sophie before it is too late. In short, this is a slow boil in the extreme, nearly nothing happens in the first 50 minutes and when it finally does, we are not emotionally committed enough to care.

    Elegant and sophisticated Catherine Lelievre is in a bind. She has been without a housekeeper for quite some time. The prospect of getting someone to come work in her suburban home as a live-in maid, appears to be Sophie, a young woman she interviews for the job as the story begins. The quiet Sophie shows promise, although Catherine does not emphasize she is taking her on a trial basis. Sophie turns out to be a terrific worker and a good cook to boot. There is one problem though, we realize she is an illiterate young woman who cannot read. Little written reminders pose a threat to her because she has no idea what is being asked for her to do. The generous LeLIevres offer to pay for her driving lessons, something she refuses because she has bad eyes. No problem, they will pay for an eye checkup! One day Sophie meets Jeanne, a woman that is a gossip and a snoop. She has the perfect job working at the post office where she is able to open the mail to her heart's content. Jeanne sees in Sophie a kindred spirit. What's more, she has discovered a secret the Lelievre's maid has told no one. Sophie was involved in a fire in the house where she was living with her older infirm father, who died in the sinister. Sophie, who might have done the deed, is not accused of anything. Yet Jeanne knows about it. Jeanne, a woman with a shady past, becomes Sophie's ally. In the meantime, things begin to change somewhat for Sophie at the Lelievres. One day, she decides to leave Catherine to fend for herself during a birthday party at the house because she must go out with Jeanne. Daughter Melinda discovers the problem with Sophie. Thinking the maid is dyslexic, she offers to help her, but Sophie overreacts by telling Melinda she knows she is hiding her pregnancy from her parents. Georges Lelievre finally explodes when he learns that Jeanne, the woman that has been reading his correspondence is being entertained at his house by Sophie. He fires her, but lets her stay for a few days. A bad decision that will backfire on him and the family. Jeanne, clearly upset by not being able to come to the house, visits one night as the family prepares to watch "Don Giovanni" on a televised broadcast which they are also recording on a portable device.
