 <sinopse>
  A failing Italian restaurant run by two brothers gambles on one special night to try to save the business.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Primo and Secondo are two brothers who have emigrated from Italy to open an Italian restaurant in America. Primo is the irascible and gifted chef, brilliant in his culinary genius, but determined not to squander his talent on making the routine dishes that customers expect. Secondo is the smooth front-man, trying to keep the restaurant financially afloat, despite few patrons other than a poor artist who pays with his paintings. The owner of the nearby Pascal's restaurant, enormously successful (despite its mediocre fare), offers a solution - he will call his friend, a big-time jazz musician, to play a special benefit at their restaurant. Primo begins to prepare his masterpiece, a feast of a lifetime, for the brothers' big night...

    "Big Night" seems to have been abruptly cut down to 100 minutes... Something feels unfinished, for this is no experimental cinema, and it follows the old rules of Aristotelian poetics. Of course, it may also be my need for answers, solutions, and a punch on Pascal's nose (as well as on insufferable Primo's), while the filmmakers were only interested in exposition. But then, in that case I prefer the films of Roy Andersson or Aki Kaurism&auml;ki (laconic characters aside), where no expectations are created for a formulaic ending. Everything is built fine, even beautifully, especially atmosphere and main characters (the others appear at the dinner party out of the blue), but then it just suddenly deflates, brothers reproach each other or their nemesis (Pascal) and then... well, Marc Anthony walks out.

    This is a one of the few movies that I went in watching having very low expectations and left very pleasantly surprised. I normally do not watch low budget cooking films (not that there are many) and I was not expecting this to be a very enthralling film at all. What I found was that this movie was only mildly about cooking, and more about the struggle for the American Dream and the family dynamic between two very proud Italian immigrants. The story takes places in New York, time unknown but given the cars and signs, it is implied that it occurs around the 1950's. Italian brothers Primos and Secondo have been running a very delicious but very traditional Italian restaurant, "Paradise". Despite Primo's fantastic cooking, American audiences come to the restaurant expecting spaghetti and meatballs like all the other Italian restaurants in New York. Younger brother Secondo recognizes this and is in a constant battle with Primo to make the restaurant more accessible, but Primo is too stuck in his ways. It quickly comes to light that the restaurant is failing and if the brothers cannot come up with the money they already owe the bank by the end of the month, the bank will foreclose. Luckily the brothers have a fellow, more successful restaurant owning friend who knows of a famous jazz musician coming to town. They plan to throw a party in his honor at the restaurant in order to reignite the restaurant's failing reputation. What follows is a hilarious and bittersweet series of events that changes up the way most movies of this nature are presented. Stanley Tucci does a fantastic job writing, directing, and starring as Secondo. Tony Shaloub also gives a great performance as Primo. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and suggest it to anyone who enjoys food and clever scripts.

    Big Night is a wonderfully well observed independent American film, from the mid 1990s, about identity; apparent class; honour; perseverance and the struggles in trying to integrate one's self to a foreign culture whilst desperately attempting to balance what you simultaneously are at heart. The film is a wonderful character piece; a film documenting cultures clashing and basic conventions of a particular field of culture, in this case: food, at the very forefront. Where the goal of the central characters is to attain the American Dream to a degree, the film covers the hardships in having to apparently let go one's traditional methods and forge new identities in a foreign territory as the supply and demands take on different forms. The film documents the troubled times of two immigrant brothers from Italy, both of whom own a restaurant in 1950s New Jersey, and their misadventures in keeping the business afloat as the manifestation of their presence has an affect on those in and around the local area. The brothers are Primo (Shalhoub) and Secondo (Tucci), their food joint is named Paradise and proudly sells the best of local Italian cuisine of the home shores from whence they both come, local dishes as well as special ingredients that produce special dishes known only to their family name. They dress smartly and the interior of the restaurant is magnificent, our first meeting with Primo sees him make sure the individual chopping the garlic gets it spot on so as to slice it to a finely tuned degree, getting the most possible out of the exercise. The film's primary point of interest is the clash in cultures these Europeans find themselves at odds with when held up against the American standards of eating, epitomised early on by a Secondo jibe at the American's eating habits of whom he accuses of preferring hot-dogs, a supposedly cheap and nasty source of replenishment, over the glorious Risotto. The brothers have very few customers, a local American couple early on sit in an empty restaurant and there is generally a sense of the couple getting mixed up in what they want; what they're ultimately ordering and the changes the female participant of the couple feels ought to be made to the dish she wants, thus highlighting the apparent ignorance the Americans possess as to what is considered by the central characters and the film itself as cuisine of a genuinely high order. Nearby lies Pascal's (Holm) restaurant, a place named after the man himself and as the brothers' business lies dormant in steady decline; Pascal serves all the junk food both parties seem to agree is as such, but said produce is what the Americans keep coming back for and is keeps Pascal's afloat. Primo and Secondo's own feeling is that buckling to the masses is unthinkable, and that serving such inadequate meals ought to be a crime against fine cuisine. We feel Holm's character shares similar sentiments and undergoes a degree of pain in his ultimate decision, but the temptation to be lead into submission to local demands thus eliminating any strain was apparently too great. Whatever parallels you'd like to draw in relation to this very European and very foreign presence in America, and both the antithetical process and attitudes towards something that can be very fine, goes without apology. The Americans, whom seemingly can only appreciate complete crap in what they choose to venture out and indulge in, only come across as naive and dumbed-down as much the two brothers come across as stubborn and flawed themselves. Secondo maintains a relationship with Phyillis (Driver), but has an affair with the wife of Pascal himself named Gabriella (Rossellini) but the film is more about the relationship between two brothers and two cultures. The text might be read into as being anti-American in its labelling of them as idiots whom persistently seek the lowest form of whatever said cultural item; only rarely does an example break out of said cycle, in doing so the film portraying them as just hopelessly ill at ease with their now new surroundings. This, as the Europeans whom are humorously represented by way of the perfectionist; life-loving; life-affirming; intelligent and well dressed Italians, struggle to comprehend the mindsets of their newly acquainted neighbours and cousins after having been brought up on supremely nourishing, now apparently elitist, items. The restaurant itself sits perched on a precipice between a welcoming beach plus promise of the ocean and a bog-standard urban street full of stores, further highlighting how easy it is as to sway either side of the line in what you get in regards to beauty or more something commonplace; the brothers even have an artist come regularly to their place, the fact the man's an artist sees the film allow each party to share the same apparent 'elitist' space in the brother's restaurant, as the fact either of their roles to produce fine items around supposedly more main stream tastes is highlighted. The big night from whence the title derives is the event the film builds to, Pascal proposing the visiting of a famous musician he's regularly in contact with to 'Paradise' might provide it with the leg-up in cash intake the place needs. The brothers gamble, producing all the specialised dishes they know for the huge crowd expected to turn up for the musical event; the food still taking second place to the event, remember, as the guarantee of razzmatazz and entertainment gets them in on a primary level just so that they may be able to have the opportunity to come to realise that finer, lesser mainstream things can be just as, if not more, enjoyable when given the chance. The cast do an immaculate job as these emotionally torn, financially struggling individuals with bonds to one another; their girlfriends; customers and rivals with the film displaying some wonderful writing in what is a wonderfully played out film.

    Stanley Tucci, who stars, co-writes and co-directs (along with Campbell Scott who has a cameo as a car salesman), succeeds in an appetizingly brilliant independent film. It success stems from the outstanding cast of talented performers to the compelling soundtrack to the immaculate editing and the scintillating cinematography. So plenty of kudos to those who've contributed to this engaging film. Tucci stars as Secondo, the younger sibling of two Italian immigrant brothers living a New Jersey who own a restaurant. Secondo is the business part of the duo, the slick guy who owns a fancy Cadillac. Primo (Tony Shalhoub) is the older brother and the master chef who has the gift for creating a plethora of culinary delights that attract people in the area to try his delightful dishes. While serving a seafood risotto to one of his patrons, the patron complains that the seafood is barely visible and that her side dish of spaghetti, didn't come with any meatballs. (One of the best quotes in the movie is..."Sometimes spaghetti wants to be alone"). Primo shrugs to the fact he believes that he is serving to a pack of Philistines. But to be honest, the Philistines are licking their chops over a Pascal's diner across the street. Pascal was played gracefully by Ian Holm, who understands that the customer is always right no matter what. The rivalries between the the opposing restaurants is absolutely astounding. When financial troubles starts brewing in The Paradise, Secondo turns to Pascal for financial but fends off from working with him. Pascal suggests to Secondo to prepare a no holds barred "big night" that will surely attract customers. Pascal offered to invite a friend of his named Louis Prima, who will eat, indulge and enjoy the atmosphere. The movie lifts off to this "Big Night" (which also has a side-story of Secondo's troubled love. During the banquet scenes, "Big Night" shifts the attention to its audience with a wonderful array of savoring food that will make your mouth water. The cast which also stars Isabella Rosselini, Minnie Driver and Allison Janney nails their respected roles to perfection. The cooking scenes look stressful, but is handled in a very subtle fashion. After the big night, many truths have been confessed, partially because it's hard to betray after such a poignant experience. If these scrumptious dishes doesn't manipulate you into walking out of the theater after the movie, to go out afterward to eat in an Italian restaurant, then what's wrong with you. What makes the film so impressive is the small things it has to offer. Whether Primo using his cup to tamper coffee grounds to making an omelet, the movie nails all the scenes to perfection. Even if the DVD has little to offer. The film itself will likely to whet your appetite.

    Trying to do something and succeeding are two different things. "Big Night" wants to be a lighthearted, cheery confection, and although there are moments when it hits the mark, there are a few when it falls flat. Overall, it is worth a look. Primo (Tony Shaloub) and Secundo (Stanley Tucci) are two brothers who have traveled from Italy in search of the American dream. In their case, it's to open a restaurant showcasing the finest Italian cuisine. Unfortunately, no one goes there, and the bank is about to foreclose. Help comes along when their friend, Pascal (Ian Holm) offers to help. Pascal knows Louie Prima, and says he will arrange for the famed jazz musician to eat dinner at their restaurant. The publicity from such an event will make their restaurant famous, so the brothers go into hyperdrive preparing. But will the plan work? The performances are universally wonderful. The central character is actually, Secundo, the younger one. And while it took Stanley Tucci another 14 years to earn an Oscar nod, he gives a terrific performance. He's the brains behind the operation. He loves what he and his brother are doing, but he's also a realist: if no one comes, then they can't do what they love anymore. Normally the answer would be obvious ("Give them what they want," as Pascal tells him), but Primo is stubborn and temperamental. There's actually more than a little bit of a character from "Rent" in him ("Give people time, they will learn") and Tony Shaloub has no trouble essaying the part. He's not an easy guy to work with, but there is a deep humanity to Primo that Shaloub essays perfectly. Ian Holm is a little too over-the-top as the foul-mouthed Pascal, but it works nonetheless. The women are just as good as the central characters. Minnie Driver is effective as Phyllis, Secundo's girlfriend who is aching for a marriage proposal. Her scenes with the stressed out Secundo are the most real; when he vents his frustration at her, she rolls it off instead of storming out of the room in an over-dramatic fashion. Allison Janney is also very good in a lowkey performance. Known for her shrill comedy, Janney's performance as the florist that is attracted to Primo (and vice versa) is quite touching. Isabella Rossellini is also very good as the lovesick Gabriella (in a far different performance from her future appearance with co-director/co-star Campbell Scott in "Roger Dodger"). Unfortunately, the film has some pacing issues. The film drags in a number of places, particularly in the beginning and the end. These scenes are supposed to be character building, but they really don't add much. But the big scene, the dinner, is amazing. "Big Night" is worth it, despite its faults. My rating: PG-13 for language.

    Two immigrant brothers from Italy try to keep their restaurant in 1950s America from going bankrupt. It's pretty well made but there's hardly a plot, and it eventually runs out of steam. The acting is good. Tucci and Shalhoub are perfectly cast as the brothers - they really look like brothers. Holm has some funny lines as the foul-mouthed owner of another restaurant. Tucci co-directed with Scott, who plays a Cadillac salesman, the first time behind the lens for both and it shows in the form of some sloppy camera work. This is not a film to watch hungry as the last third of the film is devoted to a delectable feast. Unlike the feast, however, the film is somewhat unsatisfying.

    This movie is like a good poem: it doesn't all make sense, but you love experiencing it, and after you're done you keep thinking about it for days and days. "Big Night" tells of two Italian brothers trying to succeed as restaurateurs in the 1960s. The bulk of the movie revolves a single "big night" in which they unleash their finest dishes in a culinary extravaganza. The leads, Shalhoub and Tucci, are joined by Ian Holm (depicting a rival restaurateur) in a really memorable set of performances. All the minor supporting characters are equally endearing and real-to-life. There is a lot of attention given to the food and to its preparation, and the cinematography used to actually depict the meal (and the music superimposed onto it) is fantastically enjoyable. It's like the dishes are actors or characters in the play! The movie's final scene is perhaps deserving of the all-time hall of fame. It plays out over several minutes of complete wordless silence, yet it makes such a lasting impression. Ultimately the scene shows that the movie is not about the food or the striving for success, but about the relationship between these brothers, and that the relationship will outlast any of the trials they are undergoing, no matter how severe. If you insist on a tidy ending that resolves all the issues, don't look here because the ending is completely hanging. Yet somehow I found it satisfying nevertheless. You'll find yourself recalling scenes and lines from the film for weeks to come.

    A low-key and highly entertaining indie comedy about two brothers (Stanley Tucci and Tony Shalhoub) trying to make a go of their Italian restaurant without losing their cultural identity in the process. Shalhoub is the chef stuck on tradition, who refuses to compromise his culinary integrity for whiney customers; Tucci is the more reasonable and business savvy brother who understands the need to change with the times. The acting is good all around, and the the food in the film looks so good I guarantee you will be starving before it is over. Also with Minnie Driver, Ian Holm and Isabella Rossellini. Grade: A-

    Big Night is one of those life affirming films that will have the audience exiting with their heads in the clouds,as well as hungry,as food is a central gathering force here. Two brothers,both immigrants from Italy,both run a failing Italian restaurant in New York. Failing, because the restaurant serves upscale Italian dishes (or,nouveau cuisine)in a blue collar,working class neighborhood that doesn't know (or care)beyond spaghetti & meatballs. The fact that the local bank is just a whisper away from foreclosure on the property doesn't make matters any better. A rival restaurant owner across the street (played by an cheerful,over the top Ian Holm)offers to bring his "friend",Italian-American Jazz legend, Louis Prima,to try their restaurant. Tony Shalhoub & Stanley Tucci (one of the two directors,and who also co-wrote the screenplay with Joseph Tropiano)play the two brothers who try to keep the leaky boat that is their beloved restaurant afloat. The film also gets some solid support from Minnie Driver,Isabella Rossellini,and even Marc Anthony,just as he was gaining fame as a pop singer. Campbell Scott (son of the late George C. Scott),who also co-directs the film,has a nice turn as a car salesman,who is always trying to sell just about anybody a Cadillac. Most of the second half of the film concerns the two brothers getting ready for their "big night". Does Mr.Prima ever show up for the feast? Food,food & more food are paraded on camera as much as possible. Make sure you enjoy a big meal before taking on this one. Rated 'R' by the MPAA,for vulgar language,some adult situations & much smoking.

    BIG NIGHT is the utterly charming and richly entertaining sleeper of 1996 that nobody saw and it's really a shame. This is the story of Secundo and Primo, a tight pair of Italian brothers who run an intimate Italian bistro in 1950's Brookyln who are facing bankruptcy until a business associate, so impressed with their food, promises to have his good friend, jazz musician Louis Prima, come to the restaurant for dinner and it is the preparations for this "big night" that send the brothers and everyone in their orbit into a tailspin. This joyous celebration of everything that is Italian-American completely envelops you with an almost voyeuristic atmosphere and characters who vividly touch your soul. The brothers are flawlessly played by one of our most solid and underrated character actors, the brilliant Stanley Tucci and MONK's Tony Shaloub and neither actor has ever been more appealing on screen. Tucci's Secundo is smart, sexy, charismatic, and generous of soul and Shaloub's Primo is an arrogant boob who always remains likable. Tucci co-wrote and directed this gem with actor Campbell Scott, who also appears briefly as a slick-talking used car salesman and Tucci and Scott's one scene together is a standout, but it is the atmosphere and rich characterizations that take center stage here...Ian Holm steals every scene he is in as the brothers' benefactor and Minnie Driver, Isabella Rosellini, and Allison Janney are impressive as the women in the brothers' lives. This movie is a joy from start to finish and made me wish that I was Italian. If you've never seen this one, please, treat yourself...and don't see it while you're hungry!

The cast do an immaculate job as these emotionally torn, financially struggling individuals with bonds to one another; their girlfriends; customers and rivals with the film displaying some wonderful writing in what is a wonderfully played out film.

    Stanley Tucci, who stars, co-writes and co-directs (along with Campbell Scott who has a cameo as a car salesman), succeeds in an appetizingly brilliant independent film. It success stems from the outstanding cast of talented performers to the compelling soundtrack to the immaculate editing and the scintillating cinematography. So plenty of kudos to those who've contributed to this engaging film. Tucci stars as Secondo, the younger sibling of two Italian immigrant brothers living a New Jersey who own a restaurant. Secondo is the business part of the duo, the slick guy who owns a fancy Cadillac. Primo (Tony Shalhoub) is the older brother and the master chef who has the gift for creating a plethora of culinary delights that attract people in the area to try his delightful dishes. While serving a seafood risotto to one of his patrons, the patron complains that the seafood is barely visible and that her side dish of spaghetti, didn't come with any meatballs. (One of the best quotes in the movie is..."Sometimes spaghetti wants to be alone"). Primo shrugs to the fact he believes that he is serving to a pack of Philistines. But to be honest, the Philistines are licking their chops over a Pascal's diner across the street. Pascal was played gracefully by Ian Holm, who understands that the customer is always right no matter what. The rivalries between the the opposing restaurants is absolutely astounding. When financial troubles starts brewing in The Paradise, Secondo turns to Pascal for financial but fends off from working with him. Pascal suggests to Secondo to prepare a no holds barred "big night" that will surely attract customers. Pascal offered to invite a friend of his named Louis Prima, who will eat, indulge and enjoy the atmosphere. The movie lifts off to this "Big Night" (which also has a side-story of Secondo's troubled love. During the banquet scenes, "Big Night" shifts the attention to its audience with a wonderful array of savoring food that will make your mouth water. The cast which also stars Isabella Rosselini, Minnie Driver and Allison Janney nails their respected roles to perfection. The cooking scenes look stressful, but is handled in a very subtle fashion. After the big night, many truths have been confessed, partially because it's hard to betray after such a poignant experience. If these scrumptious dishes doesn't manipulate you into walking out of the theater after the movie, to go out afterward to eat in an Italian restaurant, then what's wrong with you. What makes the film so impressive is the small things it has to offer. Whether Primo using his cup to tamper coffee grounds to making an omelet, the movie nails all the scenes to perfection. Even if the DVD has little to offer. The film itself will likely to whet your appetite.

    Trying to do something and succeeding are two different things. "Big Night" wants to be a lighthearted, cheery confection, and although there are moments when it hits the mark, there are a few when it falls flat. Overall, it is worth a look. Primo (Tony Shaloub) and Secundo (Stanley Tucci) are two brothers who have traveled from Italy in search of the American dream. In their case, it's to open a restaurant showcasing the finest Italian cuisine. Unfortunately, no one goes there, and the bank is about to foreclose. Help comes along when their friend, Pascal (Ian Holm) offers to help. Pascal knows Louie Prima, and says he will arrange for the famed jazz musician to eat dinner at their restaurant. The publicity from such an event will make their restaurant famous, so the brothers go into hyperdrive preparing. But will the plan work? The performances are universally wonderful. The central character is actually, Secundo, the younger one. And while it took Stanley Tucci another 14 years to earn an Oscar nod, he gives a terrific performance. He's the brains behind the operation. He loves what he and his brother are doing, but he's also a realist: if no one comes, then they can't do what they love anymore. Normally the answer would be obvious ("Give them what they want," as Pascal tells him), but Primo is stubborn and temperamental. There's actually more than a little bit of a character from "Rent" in him ("Give people time, they will learn") and Tony Shaloub has no trouble essaying the part. He's not an easy guy to work with, but there is a deep humanity to Primo that Shaloub essays perfectly. Ian Holm is a little too over-the-top as the foul-mouthed Pascal, but it works nonetheless. The women are just as good as the central characters. Minnie Driver is effective as Phyllis, Secundo's girlfriend who is aching for a marriage proposal. Her scenes with the stressed out Secundo are the most real; when he vents his frustration at her, she rolls it off instead of storming out of the room in an over-dramatic fashion. Allison Janney is also very good in a lowkey performance. Known for her shrill comedy, Janney's performance as the florist that is attracted to Primo (and vice versa) is quite touching. Isabella Rossellini is also very good as the lovesick Gabriella (in a far different performance from her future appearance with co-director/co-star Campbell Scott in "Roger Dodger"). Unfortunately, the film has some pacing issues. The film drags in a number of places, particularly in the beginning and the end. These scenes are supposed to be character building, but they really don't add much. But the big scene, the dinner, is amazing. "Big Night" is worth it, despite its faults. My rating: PG-13 for language.

    Two immigrant brothers from Italy try to keep their restaurant in 1950s America from going bankrupt. It's pretty well made but there's hardly a plot, and it eventually runs out of steam. The acting is good. Tucci and Shalhoub are perfectly cast as the brothers - they really look like brothers. Holm has some funny lines as the foul-mouthed owner of another restaurant. Tucci co-directed with Scott, who plays a Cadillac salesman, the first time behind the lens for both and it shows in the form of some sloppy camera work. This is not a film to watch hungry as the last third of the film is devoted to a delectable feast. Unlike the feast, however, the film is somewhat unsatisfying.

    This movie is like a good poem: it doesn't all make sense, but you love experiencing it, and after you're done you keep thinking about it for days and days. "Big Night" tells of two Italian brothers trying to succeed as restaurateurs in the 1960s. The bulk of the movie revolves a single "big night" in which they unleash their finest dishes in a culinary extravaganza. The leads, Shalhoub and Tucci, are joined by Ian Holm (depicting a rival restaurateur) in a really memorable set of performances. All the minor supporting characters are equally endearing and real-to-life. There is a lot of attention given to the food and to its preparation, and the cinematography used to actually depict the meal (and the music superimposed onto it) is fantastically enjoyable. It's like the dishes are actors or characters in the play! The movie's final scene is perhaps deserving of the all-time hall of fame. It plays out over several minutes of complete wordless silence, yet it makes such a lasting impression. Ultimately the scene shows that the movie is not about the food or the striving for success, but about the relationship between these brothers, and that the relationship will outlast any of the trials they are undergoing, no matter how severe. If you insist on a tidy ending that resolves all the issues, don't look here because the ending is completely hanging. Yet somehow I found it satisfying nevertheless. You'll find yourself recalling scenes and lines from the film for weeks to come.

    A low-key and highly entertaining indie comedy about two brothers (Stanley Tucci and Tony Shalhoub) trying to make a go of their Italian restaurant without losing their cultural identity in the process. Shalhoub is the chef stuck on tradition, who refuses to compromise his culinary integrity for whiney customers; Tucci is the more reasonable and business savvy brother who understands the need to change with the times. The acting is good all around, and the the food in the film looks so good I guarantee you will be starving before it is over. Also with Minnie Driver, Ian Holm and Isabella Rossellini. Grade: A-

    Big Night is one of those life affirming films that will have the audience exiting with their heads in the clouds,as well as hungry,as food is a central gathering force here. Two brothers,both immigrants from Italy,both run a failing Italian restaurant in New York. Failing, because the restaurant serves upscale Italian dishes (or,nouveau cuisine)in a blue collar,working class neighborhood that doesn't know (or care)beyond spaghetti & meatballs. The fact that the local bank is just a whisper away from foreclosure on the property doesn't make matters any better. A rival restaurant owner across the street (played by an cheerful,over the top Ian Holm)offers to bring his "friend",Italian-American Jazz legend, Louis Prima,to try their restaurant. Tony Shalhoub & Stanley Tucci (one of the two directors,and who also co-wrote the screenplay with Joseph Tropiano)play the two brothers who try to keep the leaky boat that is their beloved restaurant afloat. The film also gets some solid support from Minnie Driver,Isabella Rossellini,and even Marc Anthony,just as he was gaining fame as a pop singer. Campbell Scott (son of the late George C. Scott),who also co-directs the film,has a nice turn as a car salesman,who is always trying to sell just about anybody a Cadillac. Most of the second half of the film concerns the two brothers getting ready for their "big night". Does Mr.Prima ever show up for the feast? Food,food & more food are paraded on camera as much as possible. Make sure you enjoy a big meal before taking on this one. Rated 'R' by the MPAA,for vulgar language,some adult situations & much smoking.

    BIG NIGHT is the utterly charming and richly entertaining sleeper of 1996 that nobody saw and it's really a shame. This is the story of Secundo and Primo, a tight pair of Italian brothers who run an intimate Italian bistro in 1950's Brookyln who are facing bankruptcy until a business associate, so impressed with their food, promises to have his good friend, jazz musician Louis Prima, come to the restaurant for dinner and it is the preparations for this "big night" that send the brothers and everyone in their orbit into a tailspin. This joyous celebration of everything that is Italian-American completely envelops you with an almost voyeuristic atmosphere and characters who vividly touch your soul. The brothers are flawlessly played by one of our most solid and underrated character actors, the brilliant Stanley Tucci and MONK's Tony Shaloub and neither actor has ever been more appealing on screen. Tucci's Secundo is smart, sexy, charismatic, and generous of soul and Shaloub's Primo is an arrogant boob who always remains likable. Tucci co-wrote and directed this gem with actor Campbell Scott, who also appears briefly as a slick-talking used car salesman and Tucci and Scott's one scene together is a standout, but it is the atmosphere and rich characterizations that take center stage here...Ian Holm steals every scene he is in as the brothers' benefactor and Minnie Driver, Isabella Rosellini, and Allison Janney are impressive as the women in the brothers' lives. This movie is a joy from start to finish and made me wish that I was Italian. If you've never seen this one, please, treat yourself...and don't see it while you're hungry!

    "Big Night" seems to have been abruptly cut down to 100 minutes... Something feels unfinished, for this is no experimental cinema, and it follows the old rules of Aristotelian poetics. Of course, it may also be my need for answers, solutions, and a punch on Pascal's nose (as well as on insufferable Primo's), while the filmmakers were only interested in exposition. But then, in that case I prefer the films of Roy Andersson or Aki Kaurism&auml;ki (laconic characters aside), where no expectations are created for a formulaic ending. Everything is built fine, even beautifully, especially atmosphere and main characters (the others appear at the dinner party out of the blue), but then it just suddenly deflates, brothers reproach each other or their nemesis (Pascal) and then... well, Marc Anthony walks out.

    This is a one of the few movies that I went in watching having very low expectations and left very pleasantly surprised. I normally do not watch low budget cooking films (not that there are many) and I was not expecting this to be a very enthralling film at all. What I found was that this movie was only mildly about cooking, and more about the struggle for the American Dream and the family dynamic between two very proud Italian immigrants. The story takes places in New York, time unknown but given the cars and signs, it is implied that it occurs around the 1950's. Italian brothers Primos and Secondo have been running a very delicious but very traditional Italian restaurant, "Paradise". Despite Primo's fantastic cooking, American audiences come to the restaurant expecting spaghetti and meatballs like all the other Italian restaurants in New York. Younger brother Secondo recognizes this and is in a constant battle with Primo to make the restaurant more accessible, but Primo is too stuck in his ways. It quickly comes to light that the restaurant is failing and if the brothers cannot come up with the money they already owe the bank by the end of the month, the bank will foreclose. Luckily the brothers have a fellow, more successful restaurant owning friend who knows of a famous jazz musician coming to town. They plan to throw a party in his honor at the restaurant in order to reignite the restaurant's failing reputation. What follows is a hilarious and bittersweet series of events that changes up the way most movies of this nature are presented. Stanley Tucci does a fantastic job writing, directing, and starring as Secondo. Tony Shaloub also gives a great performance as Primo. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and suggest it to anyone who enjoys food and clever scripts.

    Big Night is a wonderfully well observed independent American film, from the mid 1990s, about identity; apparent class; honour; perseverance and the struggles in trying to integrate one's self to a foreign culture whilst desperately attempting to balance what you simultaneously are at heart. The film is a wonderful character piece; a film documenting cultures clashing and basic conventions of a particular field of culture, in this case: food, at the very forefront. Where the goal of the central characters is to attain the American Dream to a degree, the film covers the hardships in having to apparently let go one's traditional methods and forge new identities in a foreign territory as the supply and demands take on different forms. The film documents the troubled times of two immigrant brothers from Italy, both of whom own a restaurant in 1950s New Jersey, and their misadventures in keeping the business afloat as the manifestation of their presence has an affect on those in and around the local area. The brothers are Primo (Shalhoub) and Secondo (Tucci), their food joint is named Paradise and proudly sells the best of local Italian cuisine of the home shores from whence they both come, local dishes as well as special ingredients that produce special dishes known only to their family name. They dress smartly and the interior of the restaurant is magnificent, our first meeting with Primo sees him make sure the individual chopping the garlic gets it spot on so as to slice it to a finely tuned degree, getting the most possible out of the exercise. The film's primary point of interest is the clash in cultures these Europeans find themselves at odds with when held up against the American standards of eating, epitomised early on by a Secondo jibe at the American's eating habits of whom he accuses of preferring hot-dogs, a supposedly cheap and nasty source of replenishment, over the glorious Risotto. The brothers have very few customers, a local American couple early on sit in an empty restaurant and there is generally a sense of the couple getting mixed up in what they want; what they're ultimately ordering and the changes the female participant of the couple feels ought to be made to the dish she wants, thus highlighting the apparent ignorance the Americans possess as to what is considered by the central characters and the film itself as cuisine of a genuinely high order. Nearby lies Pascal's (Holm) restaurant, a place named after the man himself and as the brothers' business lies dormant in steady decline; Pascal serves all the junk food both parties seem to agree is as such, but said produce is what the Americans keep coming back for and is keeps Pascal's afloat. Primo and Secondo's own feeling is that buckling to the masses is unthinkable, and that serving such inadequate meals ought to be a crime against fine cuisine. We feel Holm's character shares similar sentiments and undergoes a degree of pain in his ultimate decision, but the temptation to be lead into submission to local demands thus eliminating any strain was apparently too great. Whatever parallels you'd like to draw in relation to this very European and very foreign presence in America, and both the antithetical process and attitudes towards something that can be very fine, goes without apology. The Americans, whom seemingly can only appreciate complete crap in what they choose to venture out and indulge in, only come across as naive and dumbed-down as much the two brothers come across as stubborn and flawed themselves. Secondo maintains a relationship with Phyillis (Driver), but has an affair with the wife of Pascal himself named Gabriella (Rossellini) but the film is more about the relationship between two brothers and two cultures. The text might be read into as being anti-American in its labelling of them as idiots whom persistently seek the lowest form of whatever said cultural item; only rarely does an example break out of said cycle, in doing so the film portraying them as just hopelessly ill at ease with their now new surroundings. This, as the Europeans whom are humorously represented by way of the perfectionist; life-loving; life-affirming; intelligent and well dressed Italians, struggle to comprehend the mindsets of their newly acquainted neighbours and cousins after having been brought up on supremely nourishing, now apparently elitist, items. The restaurant itself sits perched on a precipice between a welcoming beach plus promise of the ocean and a bog-standard urban street full of stores, further highlighting how easy it is as to sway either side of the line in what you get in regards to beauty or more something commonplace; the brothers even have an artist come regularly to their place, the fact the man's an artist sees the film allow each party to share the same apparent 'elitist' space in the brother's restaurant, as the fact either of their roles to produce fine items around supposedly more main stream tastes is highlighted. The big night from whence the title derives is the event the film builds to, Pascal proposing the visiting of a famous musician he's regularly in contact with to 'Paradise' might provide it with the leg-up in cash intake the place needs. The brothers gamble, producing all the specialised dishes they know for the huge crowd expected to turn up for the musical event; the food still taking second place to the event, remember, as the guarantee of razzmatazz and entertainment gets them in on a primary level just so that they may be able to have the opportunity to come to realise that finer, lesser mainstream things can be just as, if not more, enjoyable when given the chance. The cast do an immaculate job as these emotionally torn, financially struggling individuals with bonds to one another; their girlfriends; customers and rivals with the film displaying some wonderful writing in what is a wonderfully played out film.

    Big Night is one of those life affirming films that will have the audience exiting with their heads in the clouds,as well as hungry,as food is a central gathering force here. Two brothers,both immigrants from Italy,both run a failing Italian restaurant in New York. Failing, because the restaurant serves upscale Italian dishes (or,nouveau cuisine)in a blue collar,working class neighborhood that doesn't know (or care)beyond spaghetti & meatballs. The fact that the local bank is just a whisper away from foreclosure on the property doesn't make matters any better. A rival restaurant owner across the street (played by an cheerful,over the top Ian Holm)offers to bring his "friend",Italian-American Jazz legend, Louis Prima,to try their restaurant. Tony Shalhoub & Stanley Tucci (one of the two directors,and who also co-wrote the screenplay with Joseph Tropiano)play the two brothers who try to keep the leaky boat that is their beloved restaurant afloat. The film also gets some solid support from Minnie Driver,Isabella Rossellini,and even Marc Anthony,just as he was gaining fame as a pop singer. Campbell Scott (son of the late George C. Scott),who also co-directs the film,has a nice turn as a car salesman,who is always trying to sell just about anybody a Cadillac. Most of the second half of the film concerns the two brothers getting ready for their "big night". Does Mr.Prima ever show up for the feast? Food,food & more food are paraded on camera as much as possible. Make sure you enjoy a big meal before taking on this one. Rated 'R' by the MPAA,for vulgar language,some adult situations & much smoking.

    BIG NIGHT is the utterly charming and richly entertaining sleeper of 1996 that nobody saw and it's really a shame. This is the story of Secundo and Primo, a tight pair of Italian brothers who run an intimate Italian bistro in 1950's Brookyln who are facing bankruptcy until a business associate, so impressed with their food, promises to have his good friend, jazz musician Louis Prima, come to the restaurant for dinner and it is the preparations for this "big night" that send the brothers and everyone in their orbit into a tailspin. This joyous celebration of everything that is Italian-American completely envelops you with an almost voyeuristic atmosphere and characters who vividly touch your soul. The brothers are flawlessly played by one of our most solid and underrated character actors, the brilliant Stanley Tucci and MONK's Tony Shaloub and neither actor has ever been more appealing on screen. Tucci's Secundo is smart, sexy, charismatic, and generous of soul and Shaloub's Primo is an arrogant boob who always remains likable. Tucci co-wrote and directed this gem with actor Campbell Scott, who also appears briefly as a slick-talking used car salesman and Tucci and Scott's one scene together is a standout, but it is the atmosphere and rich characterizations that take center stage here...Ian Holm steals every scene he is in as the brothers' benefactor and Minnie Driver, Isabella Rosellini, and Allison Janney are impressive as the women in the brothers' lives. This movie is a joy from start to finish and made me wish that I was Italian. If you've never seen this one, please, treat yourself...and don't see it while you're hungry!

    "Big Night" seems to have been abruptly cut down to 100 minutes... Something feels unfinished, for this is no experimental cinema, and it follows the old rules of Aristotelian poetics. Of course, it may also be my need for answers, solutions, and a punch on Pascal's nose (as well as on insufferable Primo's), while the filmmakers were only interested in exposition. But then, in that case I prefer the films of Roy Andersson or Aki Kaurism&auml;ki (laconic characters aside), where no expectations are created for a formulaic ending. Everything is built fine, even beautifully, especially atmosphere and main characters (the others appear at the dinner party out of the blue), but then it just suddenly deflates, brothers reproach each other or their nemesis (Pascal) and then... well, Marc Anthony walks out.

    This is a one of the few movies that I went in watching having very low expectations and left very pleasantly surprised. I normally do not watch low budget cooking films (not that there are many) and I was not expecting this to be a very enthralling film at all. What I found was that this movie was only mildly about cooking, and more about the struggle for the American Dream and the family dynamic between two very proud Italian immigrants. The story takes places in New York, time unknown but given the cars and signs, it is implied that it occurs around the 1950's. Italian brothers Primos and Secondo have been running a very delicious but very traditional Italian restaurant, "Paradise". Despite Primo's fantastic cooking, American audiences come to the restaurant expecting spaghetti and meatballs like all the other Italian restaurants in New York. Younger brother Secondo recognizes this and is in a constant battle with Primo to make the restaurant more accessible, but Primo is too stuck in his ways. It quickly comes to light that the restaurant is failing and if the brothers cannot come up with the money they already owe the bank by the end of the month, the bank will foreclose. Luckily the brothers have a fellow, more successful restaurant owning friend who knows of a famous jazz musician coming to town. They plan to throw a party in his honor at the restaurant in order to reignite the restaurant's failing reputation. What follows is a hilarious and bittersweet series of events that changes up the way most movies of this nature are presented. Stanley Tucci does a fantastic job writing, directing, and starring as Secondo. Tony Shaloub also gives a great performance as Primo. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and suggest it to anyone who enjoys food and clever scripts.

    Big Night is a wonderfully well observed independent American film, from the mid 1990s, about identity; apparent class; honour; perseverance and the struggles in trying to integrate one's self to a foreign culture whilst desperately attempting to balance what you simultaneously are at heart. The film is a wonderful character piece; a film documenting cultures clashing and basic conventions of a particular field of culture, in this case: food, at the very forefront. Where the goal of the central characters is to attain the American Dream to a degree, the film covers the hardships in having to apparently let go one's traditional methods and forge new identities in a foreign territory as the supply and demands take on different forms. The film documents the troubled times of two immigrant brothers from Italy, both of whom own a restaurant in 1950s New Jersey, and their misadventures in keeping the business afloat as the manifestation of their presence has an affect on those in and around the local area. The brothers are Primo (Shalhoub) and Secondo (Tucci), their food joint is named Paradise and proudly sells the best of local Italian cuisine of the home shores from whence they both come, local dishes as well as special ingredients that produce special dishes known only to their family name. They dress smartly and the interior of the restaurant is magnificent, our first meeting with Primo sees him make sure the individual chopping the garlic gets it spot on so as to slice it to a finely tuned degree, getting the most possible out of the exercise. The film's primary point of interest is the clash in cultures these Europeans find themselves at odds with when held up against the American standards of eating, epitomised early on by a Secondo jibe at the American's eating habits of whom he accuses of preferring hot-dogs, a supposedly cheap and nasty source of replenishment, over the glorious Risotto. The brothers have very few customers, a local American couple early on sit in an empty restaurant and there is generally a sense of the couple getting mixed up in what they want; what they're ultimately ordering and the changes the female participant of the couple feels ought to be made to the dish she wants, thus highlighting the apparent ignorance the Americans possess as to what is considered by the central characters and the film itself as cuisine of a genuinely high order. Nearby lies Pascal's (Holm) restaurant, a place named after the man himself and as the brothers' business lies dormant in steady decline; Pascal serves all the junk food both parties seem to agree is as such, but said produce is what the Americans keep coming back for and is keeps Pascal's afloat. Primo and Secondo's own feeling is that buckling to the masses is unthinkable, and that serving such inadequate meals ought to be a crime against fine cuisine. We feel Holm's character shares similar sentiments and undergoes a degree of pain in his ultimate decision, but the temptation to be lead into submission to local demands thus eliminating any strain was apparently too great. Whatever parallels you'd like to draw in relation to this very European and very foreign presence in America, and both the antithetical process and attitudes towards something that can be very fine, goes without apology. The Americans, whom seemingly can only appreciate complete crap in what they choose to venture out and indulge in, only come across as naive and dumbed-down as much the two brothers come across as stubborn and flawed themselves. Secondo maintains a relationship with Phyillis (Driver), but has an affair with the wife of Pascal himself named Gabriella (Rossellini) but the film is more about the relationship between two brothers and two cultures. The text might be read into as being anti-American in its labelling of them as idiots whom persistently seek the lowest form of whatever said cultural item; only rarely does an example break out of said cycle, in doing so the film portraying them as just hopelessly ill at ease with their now new surroundings. This, as the Europeans whom are humorously represented by way of the perfectionist; life-loving; life-affirming; intelligent and well dressed Italians, struggle to comprehend the mindsets of their newly acquainted neighbours and cousins after having been brought up on supremely nourishing, now apparently elitist, items. The restaurant itself sits perched on a precipice between a welcoming beach plus promise of the ocean and a bog-standard urban street full of stores, further highlighting how easy it is as to sway either side of the line in what you get in regards to beauty or more something commonplace; the brothers even have an artist come regularly to their place, the fact the man's an artist sees the film allow each party to share the same apparent 'elitist' space in the brother's restaurant, as the fact either of their roles to produce fine items around supposedly more main stream tastes is highlighted. The big night from whence the title derives is the event the film builds to, Pascal proposing the visiting of a famous musician he's regularly in contact with to 'Paradise' might provide it with the leg-up in cash intake the place needs. The brothers gamble, producing all the specialised dishes they know for the huge crowd expected to turn up for the musical event; the food still taking second place to the event, remember, as the guarantee of razzmatazz and entertainment gets them in on a primary level just so that they may be able to have the opportunity to come to realise that finer, lesser mainstream things can be just as, if not more, enjoyable when given the chance. The cast do an immaculate job as these emotionally torn, financially struggling individuals with bonds to one another; their girlfriends; customers and rivals with the film displaying some wonderful writing in what is a wonderfully played out film.

    Stanley Tucci, who stars, co-writes and co-directs (along with Campbell Scott who has a cameo as a car salesman), succeeds in an appetizingly brilliant independent film. It success stems from the outstanding cast of talented performers to the compelling soundtrack to the immaculate editing and the scintillating cinematography. So plenty of kudos to those who've contributed to this engaging film. Tucci stars as Secondo, the younger sibling of two Italian immigrant brothers living a New Jersey who own a restaurant. Secondo is the business part of the duo, the slick guy who owns a fancy Cadillac. Primo (Tony Shalhoub) is the older brother and the master chef who has the gift for creating a plethora of culinary delights that attract people in the area to try his delightful dishes. While serving a seafood risotto to one of his patrons, the patron complains that the seafood is barely visible and that her side dish of spaghetti, didn't come with any meatballs. (One of the best quotes in the movie is..."Sometimes spaghetti wants to be alone"). Primo shrugs to the fact he believes that he is serving to a pack of Philistines. But to be honest, the Philistines are licking their chops over a Pascal's diner across the street. Pascal was played gracefully by Ian Holm, who understands that the customer is always right no matter what. The rivalries between the the opposing restaurants is absolutely astounding. When financial troubles starts brewing in The Paradise, Secondo turns to Pascal for financial but fends off from working with him. Pascal suggests to Secondo to prepare a no holds barred "big night" that will surely attract customers. Pascal offered to invite a friend of his named Louis Prima, who will eat, indulge and enjoy the atmosphere. The movie lifts off to this "Big Night" (which also has a side-story of Secondo's troubled love. During the banquet scenes, "Big Night" shifts the attention to its audience with a wonderful array of savoring food that will make your mouth water. The cast which also stars Isabella Rosselini, Minnie Driver and Allison Janney nails their respected roles to perfection. The cooking scenes look stressful, but is handled in a very subtle fashion. After the big night, many truths have been confessed, partially because it's hard to betray after such a poignant experience. If these scrumptious dishes doesn't manipulate you into walking out of the theater after the movie, to go out afterward to eat in an Italian restaurant, then what's wrong with you. What makes the film so impressive is the small things it has to offer. Whether Primo using his cup to tamper coffee grounds to making an omelet, the movie nails all the scenes to perfection. Even if the DVD has little to offer. The film itself will likely to whet your appetite.

    Trying to do something and succeeding are two different things. "Big Night" wants to be a lighthearted, cheery confection, and although there are moments when it hits the mark, there are a few when it falls flat. Overall, it is worth a look. Primo (Tony Shaloub) and Secundo (Stanley Tucci) are two brothers who have traveled from Italy in search of the American dream. In their case, it's to open a restaurant showcasing the finest Italian cuisine. Unfortunately, no one goes there, and the bank is about to foreclose. Help comes along when their friend, Pascal (Ian Holm) offers to help. Pascal knows Louie Prima, and says he will arrange for the famed jazz musician to eat dinner at their restaurant. The publicity from such an event will make their restaurant famous, so the brothers go into hyperdrive preparing. But will the plan work? The performances are universally wonderful. The central character is actually, Secundo, the younger one. And while it took Stanley Tucci another 14 years to earn an Oscar nod, he gives a terrific performance. He's the brains behind the operation. He loves what he and his brother are doing, but he's also a realist: if no one comes, then they can't do what they love anymore. Normally the answer would be obvious ("Give them what they want," as Pascal tells him), but Primo is stubborn and temperamental. There's actually more than a little bit of a character from "Rent" in him ("Give people time, they will learn") and Tony Shaloub has no trouble essaying the part. He's not an easy guy to work with, but there is a deep humanity to Primo that Shaloub essays perfectly. Ian Holm is a little too over-the-top as the foul-mouthed Pascal, but it works nonetheless. The women are just as good as the central characters. Minnie Driver is effective as Phyllis, Secundo's girlfriend who is aching for a marriage proposal. Her scenes with the stressed out Secundo are the most real; when he vents his frustration at her, she rolls it off instead of storming out of the room in an over-dramatic fashion. Allison Janney is also very good in a lowkey performance. Known for her shrill comedy, Janney's performance as the florist that is attracted to Primo (and vice versa) is quite touching. Isabella Rossellini is also very good as the lovesick Gabriella (in a far different performance from her future appearance with co-director/co-star Campbell Scott in "Roger Dodger"). Unfortunately, the film has some pacing issues. The film drags in a number of places, particularly in the beginning and the end. These scenes are supposed to be character building, but they really don't add much. But the big scene, the dinner, is amazing. "Big Night" is worth it, despite its faults. My rating: PG-13 for language.

    Two immigrant brothers from Italy try to keep their restaurant in 1950s America from going bankrupt. It's pretty well made but there's hardly a plot, and it eventually runs out of steam. The acting is good. Tucci and Shalhoub are perfectly cast as the brothers - they really look like brothers. Holm has some funny lines as the foul-mouthed owner of another restaurant. Tucci co-directed with Scott, who plays a Cadillac salesman, the first time behind the lens for both and it shows in the form of some sloppy camera work. This is not a film to watch hungry as the last third of the film is devoted to a delectable feast. Unlike the feast, however, the film is somewhat unsatisfying.

    This movie is like a good poem: it doesn't all make sense, but you love experiencing it, and after you're done you keep thinking about it for days and days. "Big Night" tells of two Italian brothers trying to succeed as restaurateurs in the 1960s. The bulk of the movie revolves a single "big night" in which they unleash their finest dishes in a culinary extravaganza. The leads, Shalhoub and Tucci, are joined by Ian Holm (depicting a rival restaurateur) in a really memorable set of performances. All the minor supporting characters are equally endearing and real-to-life. There is a lot of attention given to the food and to its preparation, and the cinematography used to actually depict the meal (and the music superimposed onto it) is fantastically enjoyable. It's like the dishes are actors or characters in the play! The movie's final scene is perhaps deserving of the all-time hall of fame. It plays out over several minutes of complete wordless silence, yet it makes such a lasting impression. Ultimately the scene shows that the movie is not about the food or the striving for success, but about the relationship between these brothers, and that the relationship will outlast any of the trials they are undergoing, no matter how severe. If you insist on a tidy ending that resolves all the issues, don't look here because the ending is completely hanging. Yet somehow I found it satisfying nevertheless. You'll find yourself recalling scenes and lines from the film for weeks to come.

    A low-key and highly entertaining indie comedy about two brothers (Stanley Tucci and Tony Shalhoub) trying to make a go of their Italian restaurant without losing their cultural identity in the process. Shalhoub is the chef stuck on tradition, who refuses to compromise his culinary integrity for whiney customers; Tucci is the more reasonable and business savvy brother who understands the need to change with the times. The acting is good all around, and the the food in the film looks so good I guarantee you will be starving before it is over. Also with Minnie Driver, Ian Holm and Isabella Rossellini. Grade: A-

The restaurant itself sits perched on a precipice between a welcoming beach plus promise of the ocean and a bog-standard urban street full of stores, further highlighting how easy it is as to sway either side of the line in what you get in regards to beauty or more something commonplace; the brothers even have an artist come regularly to their place, the fact the man's an artist sees the film allow each party to share the same apparent 'elitist' space in the brother's restaurant, as the fact either of their roles to produce fine items around supposedly more main stream tastes is highlighted. The big night from whence the title derives is the event the film builds to, Pascal proposing the visiting of a famous musician he's regularly in contact with to 'Paradise' might provide it with the leg-up in cash intake the place needs. The brothers gamble, producing all the specialised dishes they know for the huge crowd expected to turn up for the musical event; the food still taking second place to the event, remember, as the guarantee of razzmatazz and entertainment gets them in on a primary level just so that they may be able to have the opportunity to come to realise that finer, lesser mainstream things can be just as, if not more, enjoyable when given the chance. The cast do an immaculate job as these emotionally torn, financially struggling individuals with bonds to one another; their girlfriends; customers and rivals with the film displaying some wonderful writing in what is a wonderfully played out film.

    Stanley Tucci, who stars, co-writes and co-directs (along with Campbell Scott who has a cameo as a car salesman), succeeds in an appetizingly brilliant independent film. It success stems from the outstanding cast of talented performers to the compelling soundtrack to the immaculate editing and the scintillating cinematography. So plenty of kudos to those who've contributed to this engaging film. Tucci stars as Secondo, the younger sibling of two Italian immigrant brothers living a New Jersey who own a restaurant. Secondo is the business part of the duo, the slick guy who owns a fancy Cadillac. Primo (Tony Shalhoub) is the older brother and the master chef who has the gift for creating a plethora of culinary delights that attract people in the area to try his delightful dishes. While serving a seafood risotto to one of his patrons, the patron complains that the seafood is barely visible and that her side dish of spaghetti, didn't come with any meatballs. (One of the best quotes in the movie is..."Sometimes spaghetti wants to be alone"). Primo shrugs to the fact he believes that he is serving to a pack of Philistines. But to be honest, the Philistines are licking their chops over a Pascal's diner across the street. Pascal was played gracefully by Ian Holm, who understands that the customer is always right no matter what. The rivalries between the the opposing restaurants is absolutely astounding. When financial troubles starts brewing in The Paradise, Secondo turns to Pascal for financial but fends off from working with him. Pascal suggests to Secondo to prepare a no holds barred "big night" that will surely attract customers. Pascal offered to invite a friend of his named Louis Prima, who will eat, indulge and enjoy the atmosphere. The movie lifts off to this "Big Night" (which also has a side-story of Secondo's troubled love. During the banquet scenes, "Big Night" shifts the attention to its audience with a wonderful array of savoring food that will make your mouth water. The cast which also stars Isabella Rosselini, Minnie Driver and Allison Janney nails their respected roles to perfection. The cooking scenes look stressful, but is handled in a very subtle fashion. After the big night, many truths have been confessed, partially because it's hard to betray after such a poignant experience. If these scrumptious dishes doesn't manipulate you into walking out of the theater after the movie, to go out afterward to eat in an Italian restaurant, then what's wrong with you. What makes the film so impressive is the small things it has to offer. Whether Primo using his cup to tamper coffee grounds to making an omelet, the movie nails all the scenes to perfection. Even if the DVD has little to offer. The film itself will likely to whet your appetite.

    Trying to do something and succeeding are two different things. "Big Night" wants to be a lighthearted, cheery confection, and although there are moments when it hits the mark, there are a few when it falls flat. Overall, it is worth a look. Primo (Tony Shaloub) and Secundo (Stanley Tucci) are two brothers who have traveled from Italy in search of the American dream. In their case, it's to open a restaurant showcasing the finest Italian cuisine. Unfortunately, no one goes there, and the bank is about to foreclose. Help comes along when their friend, Pascal (Ian Holm) offers to help. Pascal knows Louie Prima, and says he will arrange for the famed jazz musician to eat dinner at their restaurant. The publicity from such an event will make their restaurant famous, so the brothers go into hyperdrive preparing. But will the plan work? The performances are universally wonderful. The central character is actually, Secundo, the younger one. And while it took Stanley Tucci another 14 years to earn an Oscar nod, he gives a terrific performance. He's the brains behind the operation. He loves what he and his brother are doing, but he's also a realist: if no one comes, then they can't do what they love anymore. Normally the answer would be obvious ("Give them what they want," as Pascal tells him), but Primo is stubborn and temperamental. There's actually more than a little bit of a character from "Rent" in him ("Give people time, they will learn") and Tony Shaloub has no trouble essaying the part. He's not an easy guy to work with, but there is a deep humanity to Primo that Shaloub essays perfectly. Ian Holm is a little too over-the-top as the foul-mouthed Pascal, but it works nonetheless. The women are just as good as the central characters. Minnie Driver is effective as Phyllis, Secundo's girlfriend who is aching for a marriage proposal. Her scenes with the stressed out Secundo are the most real; when he vents his frustration at her, she rolls it off instead of storming out of the room in an over-dramatic fashion. Allison Janney is also very good in a lowkey performance. Known for her shrill comedy, Janney's performance as the florist that is attracted to Primo (and vice versa) is quite touching. Isabella Rossellini is also very good as the lovesick Gabriella (in a far different performance from her future appearance with co-director/co-star Campbell Scott in "Roger Dodger"). Unfortunately, the film has some pacing issues. The film drags in a number of places, particularly in the beginning and the end. These scenes are supposed to be character building, but they really don't add much. But the big scene, the dinner, is amazing. "Big Night" is worth it, despite its faults. My rating: PG-13 for language.

    Two immigrant brothers from Italy try to keep their restaurant in 1950s America from going bankrupt. It's pretty well made but there's hardly a plot, and it eventually runs out of steam. The acting is good. Tucci and Shalhoub are perfectly cast as the brothers - they really look like brothers. Holm has some funny lines as the foul-mouthed owner of another restaurant. Tucci co-directed with Scott, who plays a Cadillac salesman, the first time behind the lens for both and it shows in the form of some sloppy camera work. This is not a film to watch hungry as the last third of the film is devoted to a delectable feast. Unlike the feast, however, the film is somewhat unsatisfying.

    This movie is like a good poem: it doesn't all make sense, but you love experiencing it, and after you're done you keep thinking about it for days and days. "Big Night" tells of two Italian brothers trying to succeed as restaurateurs in the 1960s. The bulk of the movie revolves a single "big night" in which they unleash their finest dishes in a culinary extravaganza. The leads, Shalhoub and Tucci, are joined by Ian Holm (depicting a rival restaurateur) in a really memorable set of performances. All the minor supporting characters are equally endearing and real-to-life. There is a lot of attention given to the food and to its preparation, and the cinematography used to actually depict the meal (and the music superimposed onto it) is fantastically enjoyable. It's like the dishes are actors or characters in the play! The movie's final scene is perhaps deserving of the all-time hall of fame. It plays out over several minutes of complete wordless silence, yet it makes such a lasting impression. Ultimately the scene shows that the movie is not about the food or the striving for success, but about the relationship between these brothers, and that the relationship will outlast any of the trials they are undergoing, no matter how severe. If you insist on a tidy ending that resolves all the issues, don't look here because the ending is completely hanging. Yet somehow I found it satisfying nevertheless. You'll find yourself recalling scenes and lines from the film for weeks to come.

    A low-key and highly entertaining indie comedy about two brothers (Stanley Tucci and Tony Shalhoub) trying to make a go of their Italian restaurant without losing their cultural identity in the process. Shalhoub is the chef stuck on tradition, who refuses to compromise his culinary integrity for whiney customers; Tucci is the more reasonable and business savvy brother who understands the need to change with the times. The acting is good all around, and the the food in the film looks so good I guarantee you will be starving before it is over. Also with Minnie Driver, Ian Holm and Isabella Rossellini. Grade: A-

    Big Night is one of those life affirming films that will have the audience exiting with their heads in the clouds,as well as hungry,as food is a central gathering force here. Two brothers,both immigrants from Italy,both run a failing Italian restaurant in New York. Failing, because the restaurant serves upscale Italian dishes (or,nouveau cuisine)in a blue collar,working class neighborhood that doesn't know (or care)beyond spaghetti & meatballs. The fact that the local bank is just a whisper away from foreclosure on the property doesn't make matters any better. A rival restaurant owner across the street (played by an cheerful,over the top Ian Holm)offers to bring his "friend",Italian-American Jazz legend, Louis Prima,to try their restaurant. Tony Shalhoub & Stanley Tucci (one of the two directors,and who also co-wrote the screenplay with Joseph Tropiano)play the two brothers who try to keep the leaky boat that is their beloved restaurant afloat. The film also gets some solid support from Minnie Driver,Isabella Rossellini,and even Marc Anthony,just as he was gaining fame as a pop singer. Campbell Scott (son of the late George C. Scott),who also co-directs the film,has a nice turn as a car salesman,who is always trying to sell just about anybody a Cadillac. Most of the second half of the film concerns the two brothers getting ready for their "big night". Does Mr.Prima ever show up for the feast? Food,food & more food are paraded on camera as much as possible. Make sure you enjoy a big meal before taking on this one. Rated 'R' by the MPAA,for vulgar language,some adult situations & much smoking.

    BIG NIGHT is the utterly charming and richly entertaining sleeper of 1996 that nobody saw and it's really a shame. This is the story of Secundo and Primo, a tight pair of Italian brothers who run an intimate Italian bistro in 1950's Brookyln who are facing bankruptcy until a business associate, so impressed with their food, promises to have his good friend, jazz musician Louis Prima, come to the restaurant for dinner and it is the preparations for this "big night" that send the brothers and everyone in their orbit into a tailspin. This joyous celebration of everything that is Italian-American completely envelops you with an almost voyeuristic atmosphere and characters who vividly touch your soul. The brothers are flawlessly played by one of our most solid and underrated character actors, the brilliant Stanley Tucci and MONK's Tony Shaloub and neither actor has ever been more appealing on screen. Tucci's Secundo is smart, sexy, charismatic, and generous of soul and Shaloub's Primo is an arrogant boob who always remains likable. Tucci co-wrote and directed this gem with actor Campbell Scott, who also appears briefly as a slick-talking used car salesman and Tucci and Scott's one scene together is a standout, but it is the atmosphere and rich characterizations that take center stage here...Ian Holm steals every scene he is in as the brothers' benefactor and Minnie Driver, Isabella Rosellini, and Allison Janney are impressive as the women in the brothers' lives. This movie is a joy from start to finish and made me wish that I was Italian. If you've never seen this one, please, treat yourself...and don't see it while you're hungry!

    "Big Night" seems to have been abruptly cut down to 100 minutes... Something feels unfinished, for this is no experimental cinema, and it follows the old rules of Aristotelian poetics. Of course, it may also be my need for answers, solutions, and a punch on Pascal's nose (as well as on insufferable Primo's), while the filmmakers were only interested in exposition. But then, in that case I prefer the films of Roy Andersson or Aki Kaurism&auml;ki (laconic characters aside), where no expectations are created for a formulaic ending. Everything is built fine, even beautifully, especially atmosphere and main characters (the others appear at the dinner party out of the blue), but then it just suddenly deflates, brothers reproach each other or their nemesis (Pascal) and then... well, Marc Anthony walks out.

    This is a one of the few movies that I went in watching having very low expectations and left very pleasantly surprised. I normally do not watch low budget cooking films (not that there are many) and I was not expecting this to be a very enthralling film at all. What I found was that this movie was only mildly about cooking, and more about the struggle for the American Dream and the family dynamic between two very proud Italian immigrants. The story takes places in New York, time unknown but given the cars and signs, it is implied that it occurs around the 1950's. Italian brothers Primos and Secondo have been running a very delicious but very traditional Italian restaurant, "Paradise". Despite Primo's fantastic cooking, American audiences come to the restaurant expecting spaghetti and meatballs like all the other Italian restaurants in New York. Younger brother Secondo recognizes this and is in a constant battle with Primo to make the restaurant more accessible, but Primo is too stuck in his ways. It quickly comes to light that the restaurant is failing and if the brothers cannot come up with the money they already owe the bank by the end of the month, the bank will foreclose. Luckily the brothers have a fellow, more successful restaurant owning friend who knows of a famous jazz musician coming to town. They plan to throw a party in his honor at the restaurant in order to reignite the restaurant's failing reputation. What follows is a hilarious and bittersweet series of events that changes up the way most movies of this nature are presented. Stanley Tucci does a fantastic job writing, directing, and starring as Secondo. Tony Shaloub also gives a great performance as Primo. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and suggest it to anyone who enjoys food and clever scripts.

    Big Night is a wonderfully well observed independent American film, from the mid 1990s, about identity; apparent class; honour; perseverance and the struggles in trying to integrate one's self to a foreign culture whilst desperately attempting to balance what you simultaneously are at heart. The film is a wonderful character piece; a film documenting cultures clashing and basic conventions of a particular field of culture, in this case: food, at the very forefront. Where the goal of the central characters is to attain the American Dream to a degree, the film covers the hardships in having to apparently let go one's traditional methods and forge new identities in a foreign territory as the supply and demands take on different forms. The film documents the troubled times of two immigrant brothers from Italy, both of whom own a restaurant in 1950s New Jersey, and their misadventures in keeping the business afloat as the manifestation of their presence has an affect on those in and around the local area. The brothers are Primo (Shalhoub) and Secondo (Tucci), their food joint is named Paradise and proudly sells the best of local Italian cuisine of the home shores from whence they both come, local dishes as well as special ingredients that produce special dishes known only to their family name. They dress smartly and the interior of the restaurant is magnificent, our first meeting with Primo sees him make sure the individual chopping the garlic gets it spot on so as to slice it to a finely tuned degree, getting the most possible out of the exercise. The film's primary point of interest is the clash in cultures these Europeans find themselves at odds with when held up against the American standards of eating, epitomised early on by a Secondo jibe at the American's eating habits of whom he accuses of preferring hot-dogs, a supposedly cheap and nasty source of replenishment, over the glorious Risotto. The brothers have very few customers, a local American couple early on sit in an empty restaurant and there is generally a sense of the couple getting mixed up in what they want; what they're ultimately ordering and the changes the female participant of the couple feels ought to be made to the dish she wants, thus highlighting the apparent ignorance the Americans possess as to what is considered by the central characters and the film itself as cuisine of a genuinely high order. Nearby lies Pascal's (Holm) restaurant, a place named after the man himself and as the brothers' business lies dormant in steady decline; Pascal serves all the junk food both parties seem to agree is as such, but said produce is what the Americans keep coming back for and is keeps Pascal's afloat. Primo and Secondo's own feeling is that buckling to the masses is unthinkable, and that serving such inadequate meals ought to be a crime against fine cuisine. We feel Holm's character shares similar sentiments and undergoes a degree of pain in his ultimate decision, but the temptation to be lead into submission to local demands thus eliminating any strain was apparently too great. Whatever parallels you'd like to draw in relation to this very European and very foreign presence in America, and both the antithetical process and attitudes towards something that can be very fine, goes without apology. The Americans, whom seemingly can only appreciate complete crap in what they choose to venture out and indulge in, only come across as naive and dumbed-down as much the two brothers come across as stubborn and flawed themselves. Secondo maintains a relationship with Phyillis (Driver), but has an affair with the wife of Pascal himself named Gabriella (Rossellini) but the film is more about the relationship between two brothers and two cultures. The text might be read into as being anti-American in its labelling of them as idiots whom persistently seek the lowest form of whatever said cultural item; only rarely does an example break out of said cycle, in doing so the film portraying them as just hopelessly ill at ease with their now new surroundings. This, as the Europeans whom are humorously represented by way of the perfectionist; life-loving; life-affirming; intelligent and well dressed Italians, struggle to comprehend the mindsets of their newly acquainted neighbours and cousins after having been brought up on supremely nourishing, now apparently elitist, items. The restaurant itself sits perched on a precipice between a welcoming beach plus promise of the ocean and a bog-standard urban street full of stores, further highlighting how easy it is as to sway either side of the line in what you get in regards to beauty or more something commonplace; the brothers even have an artist come regularly to their place, the fact the man's an artist sees the film allow each party to share the same apparent 'elitist' space in the brother's restaurant, as the fact either of their roles to produce fine items around supposedly more main stream tastes is highlighted. The big night from whence the title derives is the event the film builds to, Pascal proposing the visiting of a famous musician he's regularly in contact with to 'Paradise' might provide it with the leg-up in cash intake the place needs. The brothers gamble, producing all the specialised dishes they know for the huge crowd expected to turn up for the musical event; the food still taking second place to the event, remember, as the guarantee of razzmatazz and entertainment gets them in on a primary level just so that they may be able to have the opportunity to come to realise that finer, lesser mainstream things can be just as, if not more, enjoyable when given the chance. The cast do an immaculate job as these emotionally torn, financially struggling individuals with bonds to one another; their girlfriends; customers and rivals with the film displaying some wonderful writing in what is a wonderfully played out film.

    A low-key and highly entertaining indie comedy about two brothers (Stanley Tucci and Tony Shalhoub) trying to make a go of their Italian restaurant without losing their cultural identity in the process. Shalhoub is the chef stuck on tradition, who refuses to compromise his culinary integrity for whiney customers; Tucci is the more reasonable and business savvy brother who understands the need to change with the times. The acting is good all around, and the the food in the film looks so good I guarantee you will be starving before it is over. Also with Minnie Driver, Ian Holm and Isabella Rossellini. Grade: A-

    Big Night is one of those life affirming films that will have the audience exiting with their heads in the clouds,as well as hungry,as food is a central gathering force here. Two brothers,both immigrants from Italy,both run a failing Italian restaurant in New York. Failing, because the restaurant serves upscale Italian dishes (or,nouveau cuisine)in a blue collar,working class neighborhood that doesn't know (or care)beyond spaghetti & meatballs. The fact that the local bank is just a whisper away from foreclosure on the property doesn't make matters any better. A rival restaurant owner across the street (played by an cheerful,over the top Ian Holm)offers to bring his "friend",Italian-American Jazz legend, Louis Prima,to try their restaurant. Tony Shalhoub & Stanley Tucci (one of the two directors,and who also co-wrote the screenplay with Joseph Tropiano)play the two brothers who try to keep the leaky boat that is their beloved restaurant afloat. The film also gets some solid support from Minnie Driver,Isabella Rossellini,and even Marc Anthony,just as he was gaining fame as a pop singer. Campbell Scott (son of the late George C. Scott),who also co-directs the film,has a nice turn as a car salesman,who is always trying to sell just about anybody a Cadillac. Most of the second half of the film concerns the two brothers getting ready for their "big night". Does Mr.Prima ever show up for the feast? Food,food & more food are paraded on camera as much as possible. Make sure you enjoy a big meal before taking on this one. Rated 'R' by the MPAA,for vulgar language,some adult situations & much smoking.

    BIG NIGHT is the utterly charming and richly entertaining sleeper of 1996 that nobody saw and it's really a shame. This is the story of Secundo and Primo, a tight pair of Italian brothers who run an intimate Italian bistro in 1950's Brookyln who are facing bankruptcy until a business associate, so impressed with their food, promises to have his good friend, jazz musician Louis Prima, come to the restaurant for dinner and it is the preparations for this "big night" that send the brothers and everyone in their orbit into a tailspin. This joyous celebration of everything that is Italian-American completely envelops you with an almost voyeuristic atmosphere and characters who vividly touch your soul. The brothers are flawlessly played by one of our most solid and underrated character actors, the brilliant Stanley Tucci and MONK's Tony Shaloub and neither actor has ever been more appealing on screen. Tucci's Secundo is smart, sexy, charismatic, and generous of soul and Shaloub's Primo is an arrogant boob who always remains likable. Tucci co-wrote and directed this gem with actor Campbell Scott, who also appears briefly as a slick-talking used car salesman and Tucci and Scott's one scene together is a standout, but it is the atmosphere and rich characterizations that take center stage here...Ian Holm steals every scene he is in as the brothers' benefactor and Minnie Driver, Isabella Rosellini, and Allison Janney are impressive as the women in the brothers' lives. This movie is a joy from start to finish and made me wish that I was Italian. If you've never seen this one, please, treat yourself...and don't see it while you're hungry!

    "Big Night" seems to have been abruptly cut down to 100 minutes... Something feels unfinished, for this is no experimental cinema, and it follows the old rules of Aristotelian poetics. Of course, it may also be my need for answers, solutions, and a punch on Pascal's nose (as well as on insufferable Primo's), while the filmmakers were only interested in exposition. But then, in that case I prefer the films of Roy Andersson or Aki Kaurism&auml;ki (laconic characters aside), where no expectations are created for a formulaic ending. Everything is built fine, even beautifully, especially atmosphere and main characters (the others appear at the dinner party out of the blue), but then it just suddenly deflates, brothers reproach each other or their nemesis (Pascal) and then... well, Marc Anthony walks out.

    This is a one of the few movies that I went in watching having very low expectations and left very pleasantly surprised. I normally do not watch low budget cooking films (not that there are many) and I was not expecting this to be a very enthralling film at all. What I found was that this movie was only mildly about cooking, and more about the struggle for the American Dream and the family dynamic between two very proud Italian immigrants. The story takes places in New York, time unknown but given the cars and signs, it is implied that it occurs around the 1950's. Italian brothers Primos and Secondo have been running a very delicious but very traditional Italian restaurant, "Paradise". Despite Primo's fantastic cooking, American audiences come to the restaurant expecting spaghetti and meatballs like all the other Italian restaurants in New York. Younger brother Secondo recognizes this and is in a constant battle with Primo to make the restaurant more accessible, but Primo is too stuck in his ways. It quickly comes to light that the restaurant is failing and if the brothers cannot come up with the money they already owe the bank by the end of the month, the bank will foreclose. Luckily the brothers have a fellow, more successful restaurant owning friend who knows of a famous jazz musician coming to town. They plan to throw a party in his honor at the restaurant in order to reignite the restaurant's failing reputation. What follows is a hilarious and bittersweet series of events that changes up the way most movies of this nature are presented. Stanley Tucci does a fantastic job writing, directing, and starring as Secondo. Tony Shaloub also gives a great performance as Primo. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and suggest it to anyone who enjoys food and clever scripts.

    Big Night is a wonderfully well observed independent American film, from the mid 1990s, about identity; apparent class; honour; perseverance and the struggles in trying to integrate one's self to a foreign culture whilst desperately attempting to balance what you simultaneously are at heart. The film is a wonderful character piece; a film documenting cultures clashing and basic conventions of a particular field of culture, in this case: food, at the very forefront. Where the goal of the central characters is to attain the American Dream to a degree, the film covers the hardships in having to apparently let go one's traditional methods and forge new identities in a foreign territory as the supply and demands take on different forms. The film documents the troubled times of two immigrant brothers from Italy, both of whom own a restaurant in 1950s New Jersey, and their misadventures in keeping the business afloat as the manifestation of their presence has an affect on those in and around the local area. The brothers are Primo (Shalhoub) and Secondo (Tucci), their food joint is named Paradise and proudly sells the best of local Italian cuisine of the home shores from whence they both come, local dishes as well as special ingredients that produce special dishes known only to their family name. They dress smartly and the interior of the restaurant is magnificent, our first meeting with Primo sees him make sure the individual chopping the garlic gets it spot on so as to slice it to a finely tuned degree, getting the most possible out of the exercise. The film's primary point of interest is the clash in cultures these Europeans find themselves at odds with when held up against the American standards of eating, epitomised early on by a Secondo jibe at the American's eating habits of whom he accuses of preferring hot-dogs, a supposedly cheap and nasty source of replenishment, over the glorious Risotto. The brothers have very few customers, a local American couple early on sit in an empty restaurant and there is generally a sense of the couple getting mixed up in what they want; what they're ultimately ordering and the changes the female participant of the couple feels ought to be made to the dish she wants, thus highlighting the apparent ignorance the Americans possess as to what is considered by the central characters and the film itself as cuisine of a genuinely high order. Nearby lies Pascal's (Holm) restaurant, a place named after the man himself and as the brothers' business lies dormant in steady decline; Pascal serves all the junk food both parties seem to agree is as such, but said produce is what the Americans keep coming back for and is keeps Pascal's afloat. Primo and Secondo's own feeling is that buckling to the masses is unthinkable, and that serving such inadequate meals ought to be a crime against fine cuisine. We feel Holm's character shares similar sentiments and undergoes a degree of pain in his ultimate decision, but the temptation to be lead into submission to local demands thus eliminating any strain was apparently too great. Whatever parallels you'd like to draw in relation to this very European and very foreign presence in America, and both the antithetical process and attitudes towards something that can be very fine, goes without apology. The Americans, whom seemingly can only appreciate complete crap in what they choose to venture out and indulge in, only come across as naive and dumbed-down as much the two brothers come across as stubborn and flawed themselves. Secondo maintains a relationship with Phyillis (Driver), but has an affair with the wife of Pascal himself named Gabriella (Rossellini) but the film is more about the relationship between two brothers and two cultures. The text might be read into as being anti-American in its labelling of them as idiots whom persistently seek the lowest form of whatever said cultural item; only rarely does an example break out of said cycle, in doing so the film portraying them as just hopelessly ill at ease with their now new surroundings. This, as the Europeans whom are humorously represented by way of the perfectionist; life-loving; life-affirming; intelligent and well dressed Italians, struggle to comprehend the mindsets of their newly acquainted neighbours and cousins after having been brought up on supremely nourishing, now apparently elitist, items. The restaurant itself sits perched on a precipice between a welcoming beach plus promise of the ocean and a bog-standard urban street full of stores, further highlighting how easy it is as to sway either side of the line in what you get in regards to beauty or more something commonplace; the brothers even have an artist come regularly to their place, the fact the man's an artist sees the film allow each party to share the same apparent 'elitist' space in the brother's restaurant, as the fact either of their roles to produce fine items around supposedly more main stream tastes is highlighted. The big night from whence the title derives is the event the film builds to, Pascal proposing the visiting of a famous musician he's regularly in contact with to 'Paradise' might provide it with the leg-up in cash intake the place needs. The brothers gamble, producing all the specialised dishes they know for the huge crowd expected to turn up for the musical event; the food still taking second place to the event, remember, as the guarantee of razzmatazz and entertainment gets them in on a primary level just so that they may be able to have the opportunity to come to realise that finer, lesser mainstream things can be just as, if not more, enjoyable when given the chance. The cast do an immaculate job as these emotionally torn, financially struggling individuals with bonds to one another; their girlfriends; customers and rivals with the film displaying some wonderful writing in what is a wonderfully played out film.

    Stanley Tucci, who stars, co-writes and co-directs (along with Campbell Scott who has a cameo as a car salesman), succeeds in an appetizingly brilliant independent film. It success stems from the outstanding cast of talented performers to the compelling soundtrack to the immaculate editing and the scintillating cinematography. So plenty of kudos to those who've contributed to this engaging film. Tucci stars as Secondo, the younger sibling of two Italian immigrant brothers living a New Jersey who own a restaurant. Secondo is the business part of the duo, the slick guy who owns a fancy Cadillac. Primo (Tony Shalhoub) is the older brother and the master chef who has the gift for creating a plethora of culinary delights that attract people in the area to try his delightful dishes. While serving a seafood risotto to one of his patrons, the patron complains that the seafood is barely visible and that her side dish of spaghetti, didn't come with any meatballs. (One of the best quotes in the movie is..."Sometimes spaghetti wants to be alone"). Primo shrugs to the fact he believes that he is serving to a pack of Philistines. But to be honest, the Philistines are licking their chops over a Pascal's diner across the street. Pascal was played gracefully by Ian Holm, who understands that the customer is always right no matter what. The rivalries between the the opposing restaurants is absolutely astounding. When financial troubles starts brewing in The Paradise, Secondo turns to Pascal for financial but fends off from working with him. Pascal suggests to Secondo to prepare a no holds barred "big night" that will surely attract customers. Pascal offered to invite a friend of his named Louis Prima, who will eat, indulge and enjoy the atmosphere. The movie lifts off to this "Big Night" (which also has a side-story of Secondo's troubled love. During the banquet scenes, "Big Night" shifts the attention to its audience with a wonderful array of savoring food that will make your mouth water. The cast which also stars Isabella Rosselini, Minnie Driver and Allison Janney nails their respected roles to perfection. The cooking scenes look stressful, but is handled in a very subtle fashion. After the big night, many truths have been confessed, partially because it's hard to betray after such a poignant experience. If these scrumptious dishes doesn't manipulate you into walking out of the theater after the movie, to go out afterward to eat in an Italian restaurant, then what's wrong with you. What makes the film so impressive is the small things it has to offer. Whether Primo using his cup to tamper coffee grounds to making an omelet, the movie nails all the scenes to perfection. Even if the DVD has little to offer. The film itself will likely to whet your appetite.

    Trying to do something and succeeding are two different things. "Big Night" wants to be a lighthearted, cheery confection, and although there are moments when it hits the mark, there are a few when it falls flat. Overall, it is worth a look. Primo (Tony Shaloub) and Secundo (Stanley Tucci) are two brothers who have traveled from Italy in search of the American dream. In their case, it's to open a restaurant showcasing the finest Italian cuisine. Unfortunately, no one goes there, and the bank is about to foreclose. Help comes along when their friend, Pascal (Ian Holm) offers to help. Pascal knows Louie Prima, and says he will arrange for the famed jazz musician to eat dinner at their restaurant. The publicity from such an event will make their restaurant famous, so the brothers go into hyperdrive preparing. But will the plan work? The performances are universally wonderful. The central character is actually, Secundo, the younger one. And while it took Stanley Tucci another 14 years to earn an Oscar nod, he gives a terrific performance. He's the brains behind the operation. He loves what he and his brother are doing, but he's also a realist: if no one comes, then they can't do what they love anymore. Normally the answer would be obvious ("Give them what they want," as Pascal tells him), but Primo is stubborn and temperamental. There's actually more than a little bit of a character from "Rent" in him ("Give people time, they will learn") and Tony Shaloub has no trouble essaying the part. He's not an easy guy to work with, but there is a deep humanity to Primo that Shaloub essays perfectly. Ian Holm is a little too over-the-top as the foul-mouthed Pascal, but it works nonetheless. The women are just as good as the central characters. Minnie Driver is effective as Phyllis, Secundo's girlfriend who is aching for a marriage proposal. Her scenes with the stressed out Secundo are the most real; when he vents his frustration at her, she rolls it off instead of storming out of the room in an over-dramatic fashion. Allison Janney is also very good in a lowkey performance. Known for her shrill comedy, Janney's performance as the florist that is attracted to Primo (and vice versa) is quite touching. Isabella Rossellini is also very good as the lovesick Gabriella (in a far different performance from her future appearance with co-director/co-star Campbell Scott in "Roger Dodger"). Unfortunately, the film has some pacing issues. The film drags in a number of places, particularly in the beginning and the end. These scenes are supposed to be character building, but they really don't add much. But the big scene, the dinner, is amazing. "Big Night" is worth it, despite its faults. My rating: PG-13 for language.

    Two immigrant brothers from Italy try to keep their restaurant in 1950s America from going bankrupt. It's pretty well made but there's hardly a plot, and it eventually runs out of steam. The acting is good. Tucci and Shalhoub are perfectly cast as the brothers - they really look like brothers. Holm has some funny lines as the foul-mouthed owner of another restaurant. Tucci co-directed with Scott, who plays a Cadillac salesman, the first time behind the lens for both and it shows in the form of some sloppy camera work. This is not a film to watch hungry as the last third of the film is devoted to a delectable feast. Unlike the feast, however, the film is somewhat unsatisfying.

    This movie is like a good poem: it doesn't all make sense, but you love experiencing it, and after you're done you keep thinking about it for days and days. "Big Night" tells of two Italian brothers trying to succeed as restaurateurs in the 1960s. The bulk of the movie revolves a single "big night" in which they unleash their finest dishes in a culinary extravaganza. The leads, Shalhoub and Tucci, are joined by Ian Holm (depicting a rival restaurateur) in a really memorable set of performances. All the minor supporting characters are equally endearing and real-to-life. There is a lot of attention given to the food and to its preparation, and the cinematography used to actually depict the meal (and the music superimposed onto it) is fantastically enjoyable. It's like the dishes are actors or characters in the play! The movie's final scene is perhaps deserving of the all-time hall of fame. It plays out over several minutes of complete wordless silence, yet it makes such a lasting impression. Ultimately the scene shows that the movie is not about the food or the striving for success, but about the relationship between these brothers, and that the relationship will outlast any of the trials they are undergoing, no matter how severe. If you insist on a tidy ending that resolves all the issues, don't look here because the ending is completely hanging. Yet somehow I found it satisfying nevertheless. You'll find yourself recalling scenes and lines from the film for weeks to come.

Whatever parallels you'd like to draw in relation to this very European and very foreign presence in America, and both the antithetical process and attitudes towards something that can be very fine, goes without apology. The Americans, whom seemingly can only appreciate complete crap in what they choose to venture out and indulge in, only come across as naive and dumbed-down as much the two brothers come across as stubborn and flawed themselves. Secondo maintains a relationship with Phyillis (Driver), but has an affair with the wife of Pascal himself named Gabriella (Rossellini) but the film is more about the relationship between two brothers and two cultures. The text might be read into as being anti-American in its labelling of them as idiots whom persistently seek the lowest form of whatever said cultural item; only rarely does an example break out of said cycle, in doing so the film portraying them as just hopelessly ill at ease with their now new surroundings. This, as the Europeans whom are humorously represented by way of the perfectionist; life-loving; life-affirming; intelligent and well dressed Italians, struggle to comprehend the mindsets of their newly acquainted neighbours and cousins after having been brought up on supremely nourishing, now apparently elitist, items. The restaurant itself sits perched on a precipice between a welcoming beach plus promise of the ocean and a bog-standard urban street full of stores, further highlighting how easy it is as to sway either side of the line in what you get in regards to beauty or more something commonplace; the brothers even have an artist come regularly to their place, the fact the man's an artist sees the film allow each party to share the same apparent 'elitist' space in the brother's restaurant, as the fact either of their roles to produce fine items around supposedly more main stream tastes is highlighted. The big night from whence the title derives is the event the film builds to, Pascal proposing the visiting of a famous musician he's regularly in contact with to 'Paradise' might provide it with the leg-up in cash intake the place needs. The brothers gamble, producing all the specialised dishes they know for the huge crowd expected to turn up for the musical event; the food still taking second place to the event, remember, as the guarantee of razzmatazz and entertainment gets them in on a primary level just so that they may be able to have the opportunity to come to realise that finer, lesser mainstream things can be just as, if not more, enjoyable when given the chance. The cast do an immaculate job as these emotionally torn, financially struggling individuals with bonds to one another; their girlfriends; customers and rivals with the film displaying some wonderful writing in what is a wonderfully played out film.

    Stanley Tucci, who stars, co-writes and co-directs (along with Campbell Scott who has a cameo as a car salesman), succeeds in an appetizingly brilliant independent film. It success stems from the outstanding cast of talented performers to the compelling soundtrack to the immaculate editing and the scintillating cinematography. So plenty of kudos to those who've contributed to this engaging film. Tucci stars as Secondo, the younger sibling of two Italian immigrant brothers living a New Jersey who own a restaurant. Secondo is the business part of the duo, the slick guy who owns a fancy Cadillac. Primo (Tony Shalhoub) is the older brother and the master chef who has the gift for creating a plethora of culinary delights that attract people in the area to try his delightful dishes. While serving a seafood risotto to one of his patrons, the patron complains that the seafood is barely visible and that her side dish of spaghetti, didn't come with any meatballs. (One of the best quotes in the movie is..."Sometimes spaghetti wants to be alone"). Primo shrugs to the fact he believes that he is serving to a pack of Philistines. But to be honest, the Philistines are licking their chops over a Pascal's diner across the street. Pascal was played gracefully by Ian Holm, who understands that the customer is always right no matter what. The rivalries between the the opposing restaurants is absolutely astounding. When financial troubles starts brewing in The Paradise, Secondo turns to Pascal for financial but fends off from working with him. Pascal suggests to Secondo to prepare a no holds barred "big night" that will surely attract customers. Pascal offered to invite a friend of his named Louis Prima, who will eat, indulge and enjoy the atmosphere. The movie lifts off to this "Big Night" (which also has a side-story of Secondo's troubled love. During the banquet scenes, "Big Night" shifts the attention to its audience with a wonderful array of savoring food that will make your mouth water. The cast which also stars Isabella Rosselini, Minnie Driver and Allison Janney nails their respected roles to perfection. The cooking scenes look stressful, but is handled in a very subtle fashion. After the big night, many truths have been confessed, partially because it's hard to betray after such a poignant experience. If these scrumptious dishes doesn't manipulate you into walking out of the theater after the movie, to go out afterward to eat in an Italian restaurant, then what's wrong with you. What makes the film so impressive is the small things it has to offer. Whether Primo using his cup to tamper coffee grounds to making an omelet, the movie nails all the scenes to perfection. Even if the DVD has little to offer. The film itself will likely to whet your appetite.

    Trying to do something and succeeding are two different things. "Big Night" wants to be a lighthearted, cheery confection, and although there are moments when it hits the mark, there are a few when it falls flat. Overall, it is worth a look. Primo (Tony Shaloub) and Secundo (Stanley Tucci) are two brothers who have traveled from Italy in search of the American dream. In their case, it's to open a restaurant showcasing the finest Italian cuisine. Unfortunately, no one goes there, and the bank is about to foreclose. Help comes along when their friend, Pascal (Ian Holm) offers to help. Pascal knows Louie Prima, and says he will arrange for the famed jazz musician to eat dinner at their restaurant. The publicity from such an event will make their restaurant famous, so the brothers go into hyperdrive preparing. But will the plan work? The performances are universally wonderful. The central character is actually, Secundo, the younger one. And while it took Stanley Tucci another 14 years to earn an Oscar nod, he gives a terrific performance. He's the brains behind the operation. He loves what he and his brother are doing, but he's also a realist: if no one comes, then they can't do what they love anymore. Normally the answer would be obvious ("Give them what they want," as Pascal tells him), but Primo is stubborn and temperamental. There's actually more than a little bit of a character from "Rent" in him ("Give people time, they will learn") and Tony Shaloub has no trouble essaying the part. He's not an easy guy to work with, but there is a deep humanity to Primo that Shaloub essays perfectly. Ian Holm is a little too over-the-top as the foul-mouthed Pascal, but it works nonetheless. The women are just as good as the central characters. Minnie Driver is effective as Phyllis, Secundo's girlfriend who is aching for a marriage proposal. Her scenes with the stressed out Secundo are the most real; when he vents his frustration at her, she rolls it off instead of storming out of the room in an over-dramatic fashion. Allison Janney is also very good in a lowkey performance. Known for her shrill comedy, Janney's performance as the florist that is attracted to Primo (and vice versa) is quite touching. Isabella Rossellini is also very good as the lovesick Gabriella (in a far different performance from her future appearance with co-director/co-star Campbell Scott in "Roger Dodger"). Unfortunately, the film has some pacing issues. The film drags in a number of places, particularly in the beginning and the end. These scenes are supposed to be character building, but they really don't add much. But the big scene, the dinner, is amazing. "Big Night" is worth it, despite its faults. My rating: PG-13 for language.

    Two immigrant brothers from Italy try to keep their restaurant in 1950s America from going bankrupt. It's pretty well made but there's hardly a plot, and it eventually runs out of steam. The acting is good. Tucci and Shalhoub are perfectly cast as the brothers - they really look like brothers. Holm has some funny lines as the foul-mouthed owner of another restaurant. Tucci co-directed with Scott, who plays a Cadillac salesman, the first time behind the lens for both and it shows in the form of some sloppy camera work. This is not a film to watch hungry as the last third of the film is devoted to a delectable feast. Unlike the feast, however, the film is somewhat unsatisfying.

    This movie is like a good poem: it doesn't all make sense, but you love experiencing it, and after you're done you keep thinking about it for days and days. "Big Night" tells of two Italian brothers trying to succeed as restaurateurs in the 1960s. The bulk of the movie revolves a single "big night" in which they unleash their finest dishes in a culinary extravaganza. The leads, Shalhoub and Tucci, are joined by Ian Holm (depicting a rival restaurateur) in a really memorable set of performances. All the minor supporting characters are equally endearing and real-to-life. There is a lot of attention given to the food and to its preparation, and the cinematography used to actually depict the meal (and the music superimposed onto it) is fantastically enjoyable. It's like the dishes are actors or characters in the play! The movie's final scene is perhaps deserving of the all-time hall of fame. It plays out over several minutes of complete wordless silence, yet it makes such a lasting impression. Ultimately the scene shows that the movie is not about the food or the striving for success, but about the relationship between these brothers, and that the relationship will outlast any of the trials they are undergoing, no matter how severe. If you insist on a tidy ending that resolves all the issues, don't look here because the ending is completely hanging. Yet somehow I found it satisfying nevertheless. You'll find yourself recalling scenes and lines from the film for weeks to come.

    A low-key and highly entertaining indie comedy about two brothers (Stanley Tucci and Tony Shalhoub) trying to make a go of their Italian restaurant without losing their cultural identity in the process. Shalhoub is the chef stuck on tradition, who refuses to compromise his culinary integrity for whiney customers; Tucci is the more reasonable and business savvy brother who understands the need to change with the times. The acting is good all around, and the the food in the film looks so good I guarantee you will be starving before it is over. Also with Minnie Driver, Ian Holm and Isabella Rossellini. Grade: A-

    Big Night is one of those life affirming films that will have the audience exiting with their heads in the clouds,as well as hungry,as food is a central gathering force here. Two brothers,both immigrants from Italy,both run a failing Italian restaurant in New York. Failing, because the restaurant serves upscale Italian dishes (or,nouveau cuisine)in a blue collar,working class neighborhood that doesn't know (or care)beyond spaghetti & meatballs. The fact that the local bank is just a whisper away from foreclosure on the property doesn't make matters any better. A rival restaurant owner across the street (played by an cheerful,over the top Ian Holm)offers to bring his "friend",Italian-American Jazz legend, Louis Prima,to try their restaurant. Tony Shalhoub & Stanley Tucci (one of the two directors,and who also co-wrote the screenplay with Joseph Tropiano)play the two brothers who try to keep the leaky boat that is their beloved restaurant afloat. The film also gets some solid support from Minnie Driver,Isabella Rossellini,and even Marc Anthony,just as he was gaining fame as a pop singer. Campbell Scott (son of the late George C. Scott),who also co-directs the film,has a nice turn as a car salesman,who is always trying to sell just about anybody a Cadillac. Most of the second half of the film concerns the two brothers getting ready for their "big night". Does Mr.Prima ever show up for the feast? Food,food & more food are paraded on camera as much as possible. Make sure you enjoy a big meal before taking on this one. Rated 'R' by the MPAA,for vulgar language,some adult situations & much smoking.

    BIG NIGHT is the utterly charming and richly entertaining sleeper of 1996 that nobody saw and it's really a shame. This is the story of Secundo and Primo, a tight pair of Italian brothers who run an intimate Italian bistro in 1950's Brookyln who are facing bankruptcy until a business associate, so impressed with their food, promises to have his good friend, jazz musician Louis Prima, come to the restaurant for dinner and it is the preparations for this "big night" that send the brothers and everyone in their orbit into a tailspin. This joyous celebration of everything that is Italian-American completely envelops you with an almost voyeuristic atmosphere and characters who vividly touch your soul. The brothers are flawlessly played by one of our most solid and underrated character actors, the brilliant Stanley Tucci and MONK's Tony Shaloub and neither actor has ever been more appealing on screen. Tucci's Secundo is smart, sexy, charismatic, and generous of soul and Shaloub's Primo is an arrogant boob who always remains likable. Tucci co-wrote and directed this gem with actor Campbell Scott, who also appears briefly as a slick-talking used car salesman and Tucci and Scott's one scene together is a standout, but it is the atmosphere and rich characterizations that take center stage here...Ian Holm steals every scene he is in as the brothers' benefactor and Minnie Driver, Isabella Rosellini, and Allison Janney are impressive as the women in the brothers' lives. This movie is a joy from start to finish and made me wish that I was Italian. If you've never seen this one, please, treat yourself...and don't see it while you're hungry!
