    I have to say that my initial interest in watching this movie was for kicks but when I got more into the plot, I discovered that it could be a great film for describing the female Oedipus complex of women as defined in Psychoanalytic Theory. I thought it was a great film for students learning alternative approaches to female sexuality and Psychology. I would recommend this to any College teacher as a learning tool about Female Psychoanalysis, and Female Sexuality. The sexual material is a little strong but working with the sexuality from the perspective of observational research can be very helpful to enhance the storyline about the subject matter. It was a much more different approach to woman's sexuality than I have ever before experienced. Being a man, the main character is really looking at gender confusion in her life and their are some powerful archetypal images that are also presented in this film. I suspect Jung would have been amazed with this storyline, and Freud might have had a good example of what he calls the female Oedipus complex.

    Eve Stephens (Tilda Swinton) is a driven attorney about to become a judge. She uses her femininity to get what she wants and to rise to the top of her profession. She has passions outside of work. She craves sexual satisfaction. Not emotional attachments mind you, but the satisfaction of satisfying sexual hunger. The difficulty in balancing the two is driving her mad, and makes for an excellent film about the role women play in the corporate world. She is not satisfied with the executives in her firm; she also picks up Renee (Karen Sillas), a new psychiatrist in an elevator. Her sister, Madelyn Stephens (Amy Madigan), fulfills her erotic desire by shoplifting. Eve is forced to deal with her problem to keep on track for the judgeship. She also has problems dealing wither her replacement (Paulina Porizkova), who is considerably more attractive. I am not sure about the fantasy sequences with what I guess to be an Earthwoman. There was enough interesting characters besides her sister - a woman who runs a bridal store (Laila Robins), a stripper (Frances Fisher) and an adolescent tomboy named Ed (Dale Shuger), who is into self-mutilation - that they could have kept it real.

    The title of this film is dangerously misleading because the film might be thought to be pornographic, and many people who might otherwise find it interesting will not see it. (The contrary is also the case, that all the wrong people will want to watch it because they are titillated by the title. They will also react with violent antipathy, in the wake of their disappointment. The choice of title seems to have been a deliberate act of provocation.) The German title, translated, is 'Fantasies of a Woman', which is rather milder. The film is a feminist essay, and the title is intended to be ironical, the 'female perversions' referred to being those imposed upon women by a conventional male-dominated society, so that for instance being a housewife is regarded as one type of 'female perversion'. It seems somehow natural that the wildly experimental Tilda Swinton would have to be in this film: indeed, how could she say no? How could such a film be made without her? She seems to be everywhere that people and films are pushing the envelope. As usual, she is breathtakingly brilliant. A surprising addition to the cast is Frances Fisher, who made such an impact as Angie, the red-headed waitress in the diner, in the intriguing television series 'Strange Luck' in 1995-6, at about this same time. Here she does some rather unnerving 'exotic dance' routines, which all goes to show something, I'm still trying to decide what, but whatever the reason for this is, she does it very well and one would think she had been a stripper or a showgirl all her life if one did not know she had instead been an actress. Tilda Swinton is electric here as a career gal who is so tense she might snap like a wire stretched too taut. She is about to be made a judge, God help us! (Many judges are crazy or weird anyway, but she would be more so than most, as the film makes all too clear.) Tilda Swinton portrays an extreme neurotic, and 'looking good' is essential to her, so she is always doing and re-doing her lipstick (an insecure woman's last refuge). She is a control freak and insanely superstitious. For instance, if she cannot wear her white suit for an interview with the Governor of California (not Arnie, a fictional one) for a judgeship, because it is 'lucky', she falls apart. Her kleptomaniac sister sees to it that she cannot wear the suit to the interview. Things are pretty tense like this throughout, and there are many fantasy elements to this film written, produced, and directed by women with women for women. I don't believe this film can really be excused by a 'women searching for their identities' justification, and if one approaches it earnestly from that angle (which may have been the earnest intention of the makers, for all I know), it is a failure which verges on parody sometimes, and has pretentious aspects. The merits of the film are different, and concern the intensity of portrayal and the mysterious depths of character revealed, especially of hidden or suppressed motivations. The lesbian aspects of the film are not central, but merely a part of the evolving self-realization of Tilda Swinton's character. I am firmly convinced that men can never understand women and women can never understand men. I first came to realize this in my teens when the novelist Pearl Buck said to me that 'men and women are completely different species and can never hope to understand one another'. That shocked me a lot, I never forgot it, and it has been repeatedly verified. I have now come to the conclusion that Nature has designed things this way. The imperative of Nature is the propagation of the species. If men and women understood each other, that would get in the way of propagation, and many fewer babies would be born. Consequently, evolutionary pressures have seen to it that this can never happen, in order to safeguard the future of the species. That is why men like myself who do not regard women as inferior beings (as many of my gender definitely do) are so intrigued by 'the mystery of women' and interested to see attempts to make films like this one where women contemplate women and try to understand themselves. It is true that there are no admirable characters on offer here, and that they are all pretty horrible people. Nevertheless, this film manages to be fascinating, although it is understandable that it would cause a lot of contradictory reactions, some of them violently opposed to it, and some admiring and appreciative. If we want films to punch us in the ribs instead of putting us to sleep, this one certainly qualifies. This is what is called 'independent film making', and long may it continue.

    On not becoming archetypal FEMALE PERVERSIONS, based upon FEMALE PERVERSIONS: THE TEMPTATIONS OF EMMA BOVARY (by Louise Kaplan) is a good indie movie about a particular woman , also about women's world and female representation of the world. I enjoyed it a lot, and took it in with delight. The cast is really distinguished. I feared some experimental junk, but no, the movie is interesting and wellÂ—conceived and marvelously written, more interesting than any conventionally suspenseful flick. It's one of the few good American movies of the '90s. And the fact is that Streitfeld (unknown to me) rolls the ball. She gets the ball rolling and shows she means business. Very art-house, very indie, FEMALE PERVERSIONS is directed by Susan Streitfeld, written by Julie Hebert and Susan Streitfeld, and performed by Tilda Swinton, Amy Madigan (as 'Evelyn''s sister), Karen Sillas (as the psychiatrist, Ren&eacute;e, Evelyn's lover), Frances Fisher, Marcia Cross (whose fans should be aware that her tits are on display in this movie!), Paulina Porizkova (as Langley, Evie's rival). They're all pretty fine girls. In the nude scenes, the genitalia are unfortunately blurred; in exchange, almost each actress displays her titsÂ—beginning with Mrs. Swinton, of course; then Amy Madigan, Karen Sillas, Frances Fisher, Marcia CrossÂ—so, a tits parade. These girls honestly show what they got. Swinton, Sillas, Cross have awesome bodies. Mrs. Swinton is indeed beautiful and she delivers a fine performance. Poor Evelyn is a woman of career; she is beautiful, ambitious, angry, neurotic, insecure, sexually voracious, puzzled, confused, scared, morally degenerate; sexuality and career are the two coordinates of her life ,and she's consumed by her sexual desires. It's a nice, sharp study in comportment and reactions, an identity quest. The story has some kind of a psychoanalytical twist; Evie reaches to a childhood trauma. A bit naturalistic, a bit expressionist as well, the movie is a wholly feminine creation, hence somewhat viscous. There are grotesque and fancy touches as well. 'We all dream.' That's hardcore indie, babe.

    I saw this movie on a rented DVD in 2008. It is really bad, first of all they should sue the microphone guy for letting the micro appear so much into the picture of the movie (I never saw that happening before in any of the movies I have seen.....), and the director for such a lack of diligence and professionalism. If that kind of thing is let to happen, what can be said of the efforts input in other parts of the movie??? Streitfeld seems to try to improvise herself as Lynch in some scenes (in the house with the 3 women and the girl) but it is not a success at all... Yes, if you see that movie you will see Swinton naked. But I am not sure that it is really an attraction... the former model playing the new attorney in the movie would have been a much safer bet.

    This film is like no other: I find it indescribably brilliant and subtle. If you watch it many times over, as I have, you will discover infinite layers. (Even the props have hidden messages in them!) This film is so on-target about the complexities of being a woman in our time. I feel it should be required watching for 20 year old women entering the real world, followed by a discussion with women who have lived in it for a while. It seems like it might be a difficult film for a man to understand. Perhaps some of the responses here are from people who never should have picked up this movie in the first place, a case of bad labeling or description on the jacket. I was recently reminded of the existence of this film, although it is in my collection. I will presently look for anything that this screenwriter/director has made since, as she is nothing short of brilliant.

    Tilda Swinton chooses films that at first may strike the viewer as facile in their willingness to experiment with the role of the actor. Consider the title character dully staring directly out from the frame for much of 'Orlando'. I myself felt much initial impatience there, but after some time passed I could see a larger context. (See the classic Laura Mulvey article.) 'Female Perversions' might be guilty of cutesy irony or even some bathos, but its heart is solid gold. Women leaving the film after viewing it in Seattle circled around the U District, running into each other again & again, unwilling to leave the residue of truth-telling that remained as long as we let it, it seemed. Do females need sympathizers such as Flaubert surely was? We can probably get along without them but it's nice to have a friend on the other side of the gender construct. FP is a little funny, a little sad, one version of the real (and therefore legit). It might make us squirm in its sincerity. Can you handle it?

    A great cast. Tilda Swinton is a huge film star. Her presence is amazing, and is perfect in the role as the protagonist of this film. Walk into the world of Louise Kaplan and the film director, Susan Streitfeld and be entertained. The camera work is great, the art direction too is wonderful. It is a mind/intellectual fantasy. Step into the world of these film makers and relax. It is strange and beautiful, thoughtful and provocative. Unfortunately, the film is no longer available on DVD....I hope it will soon be re-released. It is worth it. Give the film a chance. It deserves it. There are beautiful moments of cinematographic magic! And the acting is great. Thank you for this film....

    This film deserves a "zero." Don't waste your rental dollar. Utter waste of time. Unfortunately, I need to write 10 lines minimum to comment. I wonder if mere periods count. Period. Period. Period. An alert middle-schooler could have done a better job with every aspect of this disaster. You have been warned! Seriously. Really. (IMDB screens should be made available in every rental store. The informed renter is a happy renter.) Oh come on. Still not enough lines. Sigh. Okay, read each of the reasonably coherent criticisms of this film as posted by other users and multiply the awful quotient by 5. There, that should do it.

    Tilda Swinton chooses films that at first may strike the viewer as facile in their willingness to experiment with the role of the actor. Consider the title character dully staring directly out from the frame for much of 'Orlando'. I myself felt much initial impatience there, but after some time passed I could see a larger context. (See the classic Laura Mulvey article.) 'Female Perversions' might be guilty of cutesy irony or even some bathos, but its heart is solid gold. Women leaving the film after viewing it in Seattle circled around the U District, running into each other again & again, unwilling to leave the residue of truth-telling that remained as long as we let it, it seemed. Do females need sympathizers such as Flaubert surely was? We can probably get along without them but it's nice to have a friend on the other side of the gender construct. FP is a little funny, a little sad, one version of the real (and therefore legit). It might make us squirm in its sincerity. Can you handle it?

    A great cast. Tilda Swinton is a huge film star. Her presence is amazing, and is perfect in the role as the protagonist of this film. Walk into the world of Louise Kaplan and the film director, Susan Streitfeld and be entertained. The camera work is great, the art direction too is wonderful. It is a mind/intellectual fantasy. Step into the world of these film makers and relax. It is strange and beautiful, thoughtful and provocative. Unfortunately, the film is no longer available on DVD....I hope it will soon be re-released. It is worth it. Give the film a chance. It deserves it. There are beautiful moments of cinematographic magic! And the acting is great. Thank you for this film....

    This film deserves a "zero." Don't waste your rental dollar. Utter waste of time. Unfortunately, I need to write 10 lines minimum to comment. I wonder if mere periods count. Period. Period. Period. An alert middle-schooler could have done a better job with every aspect of this disaster. You have been warned! Seriously. Really. (IMDB screens should be made available in every rental store. The informed renter is a happy renter.) Oh come on. Still not enough lines. Sigh. Okay, read each of the reasonably coherent criticisms of this film as posted by other users and multiply the awful quotient by 5. There, that should do it.

    I have to say that my initial interest in watching this movie was for kicks but when I got more into the plot, I discovered that it could be a great film for describing the female Oedipus complex of women as defined in Psychoanalytic Theory. I thought it was a great film for students learning alternative approaches to female sexuality and Psychology. I would recommend this to any College teacher as a learning tool about Female Psychoanalysis, and Female Sexuality. The sexual material is a little strong but working with the sexuality from the perspective of observational research can be very helpful to enhance the storyline about the subject matter. It was a much more different approach to woman's sexuality than I have ever before experienced. Being a man, the main character is really looking at gender confusion in her life and their are some powerful archetypal images that are also presented in this film. I suspect Jung would have been amazed with this storyline, and Freud might have had a good example of what he calls the female Oedipus complex.

    Eve Stephens (Tilda Swinton) is a driven attorney about to become a judge. She uses her femininity to get what she wants and to rise to the top of her profession. She has passions outside of work. She craves sexual satisfaction. Not emotional attachments mind you, but the satisfaction of satisfying sexual hunger. The difficulty in balancing the two is driving her mad, and makes for an excellent film about the role women play in the corporate world. She is not satisfied with the executives in her firm; she also picks up Renee (Karen Sillas), a new psychiatrist in an elevator. Her sister, Madelyn Stephens (Amy Madigan), fulfills her erotic desire by shoplifting. Eve is forced to deal with her problem to keep on track for the judgeship. She also has problems dealing wither her replacement (Paulina Porizkova), who is considerably more attractive. I am not sure about the fantasy sequences with what I guess to be an Earthwoman. There was enough interesting characters besides her sister - a woman who runs a bridal store (Laila Robins), a stripper (Frances Fisher) and an adolescent tomboy named Ed (Dale Shuger), who is into self-mutilation - that they could have kept it real.

    The title of this film is dangerously misleading because the film might be thought to be pornographic, and many people who might otherwise find it interesting will not see it. (The contrary is also the case, that all the wrong people will want to watch it because they are titillated by the title. They will also react with violent antipathy, in the wake of their disappointment. The choice of title seems to have been a deliberate act of provocation.) The German title, translated, is 'Fantasies of a Woman', which is rather milder. The film is a feminist essay, and the title is intended to be ironical, the 'female perversions' referred to being those imposed upon women by a conventional male-dominated society, so that for instance being a housewife is regarded as one type of 'female perversion'. It seems somehow natural that the wildly experimental Tilda Swinton would have to be in this film: indeed, how could she say no? How could such a film be made without her? She seems to be everywhere that people and films are pushing the envelope. As usual, she is breathtakingly brilliant. A surprising addition to the cast is Frances Fisher, who made such an impact as Angie, the red-headed waitress in the diner, in the intriguing television series 'Strange Luck' in 1995-6, at about this same time. Here she does some rather unnerving 'exotic dance' routines, which all goes to show something, I'm still trying to decide what, but whatever the reason for this is, she does it very well and one would think she had been a stripper or a showgirl all her life if one did not know she had instead been an actress. Tilda Swinton is electric here as a career gal who is so tense she might snap like a wire stretched too taut. She is about to be made a judge, God help us! (Many judges are crazy or weird anyway, but she would be more so than most, as the film makes all too clear.) Tilda Swinton portrays an extreme neurotic, and 'looking good' is essential to her, so she is always doing and re-doing her lipstick (an insecure woman's last refuge). She is a control freak and insanely superstitious. For instance, if she cannot wear her white suit for an interview with the Governor of California (not Arnie, a fictional one) for a judgeship, because it is 'lucky', she falls apart. Her kleptomaniac sister sees to it that she cannot wear the suit to the interview. Things are pretty tense like this throughout, and there are many fantasy elements to this film written, produced, and directed by women with women for women. I don't believe this film can really be excused by a 'women searching for their identities' justification, and if one approaches it earnestly from that angle (which may have been the earnest intention of the makers, for all I know), it is a failure which verges on parody sometimes, and has pretentious aspects. The merits of the film are different, and concern the intensity of portrayal and the mysterious depths of character revealed, especially of hidden or suppressed motivations. The lesbian aspects of the film are not central, but merely a part of the evolving self-realization of Tilda Swinton's character. I am firmly convinced that men can never understand women and women can never understand men. I first came to realize this in my teens when the novelist Pearl Buck said to me that 'men and women are completely different species and can never hope to understand one another'. That shocked me a lot, I never forgot it, and it has been repeatedly verified. I have now come to the conclusion that Nature has designed things this way. The imperative of Nature is the propagation of the species. If men and women understood each other, that would get in the way of propagation, and many fewer babies would be born. Consequently, evolutionary pressures have seen to it that this can never happen, in order to safeguard the future of the species. That is why men like myself who do not regard women as inferior beings (as many of my gender definitely do) are so intrigued by 'the mystery of women' and interested to see attempts to make films like this one where women contemplate women and try to understand themselves. It is true that there are no admirable characters on offer here, and that they are all pretty horrible people. Nevertheless, this film manages to be fascinating, although it is understandable that it would cause a lot of contradictory reactions, some of them violently opposed to it, and some admiring and appreciative. If we want films to punch us in the ribs instead of putting us to sleep, this one certainly qualifies. This is what is called 'independent film making', and long may it continue.

    On not becoming archetypal FEMALE PERVERSIONS, based upon FEMALE PERVERSIONS: THE TEMPTATIONS OF EMMA BOVARY (by Louise Kaplan) is a good indie movie about a particular woman , also about women's world and female representation of the world. I enjoyed it a lot, and took it in with delight. The cast is really distinguished. I feared some experimental junk, but no, the movie is interesting and wellÂ—conceived and marvelously written, more interesting than any conventionally suspenseful flick. It's one of the few good American movies of the '90s. And the fact is that Streitfeld (unknown to me) rolls the ball. She gets the ball rolling and shows she means business. Very art-house, very indie, FEMALE PERVERSIONS is directed by Susan Streitfeld, written by Julie Hebert and Susan Streitfeld, and performed by Tilda Swinton, Amy Madigan (as 'Evelyn''s sister), Karen Sillas (as the psychiatrist, Ren&eacute;e, Evelyn's lover), Frances Fisher, Marcia Cross (whose fans should be aware that her tits are on display in this movie!), Paulina Porizkova (as Langley, Evie's rival). They're all pretty fine girls. In the nude scenes, the genitalia are unfortunately blurred; in exchange, almost each actress displays her titsÂ—beginning with Mrs. Swinton, of course; then Amy Madigan, Karen Sillas, Frances Fisher, Marcia CrossÂ—so, a tits parade. These girls honestly show what they got. Swinton, Sillas, Cross have awesome bodies. Mrs. Swinton is indeed beautiful and she delivers a fine performance. Poor Evelyn is a woman of career; she is beautiful, ambitious, angry, neurotic, insecure, sexually voracious, puzzled, confused, scared, morally degenerate; sexuality and career are the two coordinates of her life ,and she's consumed by her sexual desires. It's a nice, sharp study in comportment and reactions, an identity quest. The story has some kind of a psychoanalytical twist; Evie reaches to a childhood trauma. A bit naturalistic, a bit expressionist as well, the movie is a wholly feminine creation, hence somewhat viscous. There are grotesque and fancy touches as well. 'We all dream.' That's hardcore indie, babe.

    I saw this movie on a rented DVD in 2008. It is really bad, first of all they should sue the microphone guy for letting the micro appear so much into the picture of the movie (I never saw that happening before in any of the movies I have seen.....), and the director for such a lack of diligence and professionalism. If that kind of thing is let to happen, what can be said of the efforts input in other parts of the movie??? Streitfeld seems to try to improvise herself as Lynch in some scenes (in the house with the 3 women and the girl) but it is not a success at all... Yes, if you see that movie you will see Swinton naked. But I am not sure that it is really an attraction... the former model playing the new attorney in the movie would have been a much safer bet.

    This film is like no other: I find it indescribably brilliant and subtle. If you watch it many times over, as I have, you will discover infinite layers. (Even the props have hidden messages in them!) This film is so on-target about the complexities of being a woman in our time. I feel it should be required watching for 20 year old women entering the real world, followed by a discussion with women who have lived in it for a while. It seems like it might be a difficult film for a man to understand. Perhaps some of the responses here are from people who never should have picked up this movie in the first place, a case of bad labeling or description on the jacket. I was recently reminded of the existence of this film, although it is in my collection. I will presently look for anything that this screenwriter/director has made since, as she is nothing short of brilliant.

    Tilda Swinton is a marvelous actress, but she's at a real loss here playing a high-powered attorney, operating under a mass of neuroses, who is on her way to becoming a judge yet sidelined by family issues. Adaptation of Louise Kaplan's book gets a quasi-art-house treatment by director Susan Streitfeld, who wants desperately to make points out of symbolism but is far too heavy handed in her approach to involve an audience. Amy Madigan does some solid work as Swinston's petty thief sister, but Swinton herself is impossible to get a grip on. Changing her hairstyles and overall appearance like a chameleon, Swinton is icy and aloof. There's a good actress under all this artifice, but Streitfeld is too concerned with showing off, and everyone suffers as a result. * from ****
