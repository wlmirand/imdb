    Every single man's dilemma, how can he find a direct path to the kingdom of the holy grail? In the movie Booty Call stars Bunz (Jamie Foxx) and Rushon (Tommy Davidson) as they spend one night going out on a double date. Rushon been pursuing his lady for seven weeks and tonight is the night so he brings in the reserves with his best friend Bunz to give him the luck he needs. This adventure begins innocently enough and gets mixed up with a whole bunch of twist and turns. They go from down town to up down as they eat a meal and go out to get to find the proper protection for the evening. With the dog in tow the duo hit the road and finally seems like they are settled in when all of a sudden the green light gets stopped. Good to see the style of Bernie Mac as the Rev Judge in bring in purity voice. Seeing this movie showcase some young talent before they made it big, with lots of 90s references it is a fun to go back to a simpler age and time but the path to the holy grail is not a straight shot. But always remember that the woman is how the evening is going to end and as the movie's tag line, "some guys will do anything for a little somethin' something' " A laugh a minute.

    Years before winning an Oscar for Ray, the biopic about Ray Charles, Jamie Foxx was in Booty Call, a much less serious movie. Here, he is Bunz, the best friend of Rushon(Tommy Davidson), who is dating Nikki(Tamala Jones), and they decide on a double date, adding Lysterine(Vivica A. Fox) to the mix. All is going smoothly until the couples get in the mood, but the two guys don't have protection for safe sex. Most of film entails Foxx and Davidson on a quest to find condoms and their disastrous results. Foxx has proved to be an incredibly versatile actor; from Ray, to Any Given Sunday, and even In Living Colour, the guy is a major talent. Booty Call is a silly, lightweight comedy, but Foxx and his costars make it funny and endearing. It is a one note joke, but the four major players work well together for a breezy 80 minutes.

    For those of you who don't know it, a Booty Call is is a telephone call, other communication, or visitation made with the sole intent of engaging in sex or other forms of sexual release with the person being contacted. Traditionally this social practice, especially the term booty call, is associated with a person calling another person for a sexual encounter after having already established either a casual or more serious relationship involving sexual relations. Now, stars of this film seem to have a great time, and you will too. I wish Cedric the Entertainer had been here, but hey, not all films are purrfect. 8 out of 8. See ya'll.

    I know this movie has it's critics only being rated 4.9/10, but so many characters in this movie led by Jamie Foxx were hilarious. I first saw this movie in 1999 and waited until 2006 for it's release on DVD. Booty Call is a comedy based on the dating scene and the struggle it can become; especially if you're a guy. Jamie Foxx played Bunz who was practically a dog on heat going to any length to score before sunrise, hence the movie's title Booty Call. His best mate and side kick in this adventure - Rushon who brought a serious side to the movie as he was more involved in a relationship. Along the way I found this movie really reached it's peak when the two guys visited the convenient store, where two Indian immigrants worked behind the counter who I thought added so much to this movie making it hilarious. Even Judge Peabody played by Bernie Mac delivered a great short appearance preaching the gospel and the danger's of sex even though he was on his way home with a prostitute. The movie does slow down a little towards the end when the couples visited the hospital, but still there were scenes that delivered a laugh. In all it's a short film but you will find it enjoyable from the restaurant scene in the beginning to the very end credits. And not a bad soundtrack if R & B and hip hop is your preferred choice in music. 9/10 - Based on the written material and the characters.

    Enjoyed this film from the very beginning to the end and it had me laughing until my sides hurt. Jamie Foxx, (Bunz) along with Tommy Davidson, (Rushon) gave an outstanding performance as two guys trying to score with two gals who demanded Glad Wrap and were very particular about the type of condoms the guys were going to utilize. Vivica A Fox,(Lysterine) and Tamala Jones (Nikki) gave a great supporting role as the gals who Bunz and Rushon tried to score with. This film goes all around in Chinatown, a hospital and plenty of bedrooms and even a taxi cab. If you like Jamie Foxx and love his acting and comedy, this is the film you will greatly enjoy viewing.

    One of the first Jamie Fox films I ever saw years ago and loved it! He is really funny in this movie and you could see he was going to be a big star. Its definitely not a film everyone would enjoy but if you like films like 'Friday' and anything with the Wayans brothers you will be laughing out loud. There are a good few scenes that were extremely funny, in-particular the supermarket scenes where the main characters visit several times during one crazy night and are ridiculed by the two staff who do remind me of Apu from the Simpsons. Also the scene where Rushon and Bunz (Jamie Fox) wrap themselves in cling-film made me cry with laughter! Vivica A Fox was good in the film as well but the show is stolen by Jamie Fox. Highly recommend this movie.Great 'pick me up' film.

    Comedies like this one have to be written by a team. There's too much camaraderie, inside language, specified jokesComedies like this can also be considered absolutely absurd or rather original and interesting. I go for the second option, because I was amused by how intelligently the situations presented in "Booty Call" were resolved. Two best friends. One of them has been dating, but can't get laid, so he needs the other one's help to go out on a blind date with his girlfriend's friend. The girl's friend in classy, the guy's friend is not, but somehow and ultimately they click. They go to the girl's house to play cards and things get hot; very hotHot enough to literally get into bed, just before the girls ask for a safe sex. It is after the girls ask for a safe sex that things get complicated, and the two men must go in the search of security; that sometimes can include walking a dog. But what if the dog escapes? They can calmly go to buy their things in a store; but what if the store gets robbed? They can find the Judge (cameo by the stunning Bernie Mac) and he tells them not to have sex and immediately a hot lady asks him to hurry up? What if they end up in a hospital? The movie is short, and it develops its time in the friends' adventures to get their "booties". The script by Takashi Bufford and J. Stanford Parker is well constructed and kept real enough to maintain the entertainment. It also contains some very funny sequences that, helped by the performances, show the writers' natural comedic timing. On the side of the camera, Jeff Pollack handles the job with plenty of skill, with a constant movement and rhythm, and the decision of making the image look much older than its actual time, which actually helps the movie's groove a lot. All the right calls for the man, even in terms of directing his actors; and the film's a comedy. Not your ordinary comedy, a black comedy perhaps, but not because it has black humor; because it occurs around black people. Not in the black neighborhood here precisely, but in Chinatown. Chinatown is that neighborhood that supposedly has got everything, but in the middle of the night, when two friends are in need for condoms, it is practically deserted. The performances fill the movie with motivation. The two pals are played by Tommy Davidson and Jamie Foxx (am I the only person that hasn't seen "Ray"?), both from the series "In Living Color", but the latter one fresh from his "The Jamie Foxx Show". Davidson stay calm until moments he looses it and we laugh; Foxx is a genius with all the one-liners and direct commentaries that keep you feeling him until the credits roll. Vivica A. Fox plays the classy Lysterine, and she excels constantly. Today she is between the highest paid black actresses of the industry. Tamala Jones also got some roles after this film, and she is still working today. She has the innocent look but the killing attitude. It's like that with all the African-Americans really; they want to be aside. I don't mean the people in this film, but there are lots of examples, and it's a topic I would be pleased to deal with.

    I'm writing this in response to the obvious moron that wrote the following quote.........."Watched the funny Chinese restaurant scene and figured that would be it. My hand was poised on the remote, ready to turn it off, but my fingers wouldn't press the button." .......... All I'm gonna say is what kind of moron watches a scene that they find to be "funny" and wants to turn the movie off. If in fact you actually got booty calls you would understand the humor in this movie, or if you were even the least bit intelligent, you would realize the stupidity of your comment....... You don't turn a movie off upon seeing a scene that you find funny..... Unless you are moron..... enough said. Also... Why in gods name are you "embarressed" by a movie like this..... Its hilarious. Go get a life, and a booty call..... you just might understand this movie.

    OK, now when you see a movie titled "Booty Call," you can't expect high art. But I can expect a ton of laughs. Unfortunately, now that I'm a young adult, I don't find the film as funny as I did when I saw it in grade school. When you're in grade school, you'll laugh at anything with a penis reference. Dirty and raunchy don't necessarily have to translate into dull and unfunny. Hell, even Mel Brooks was popular for doing plenty of low-brow humor, but he knows how to deliver the crudeness in a hilarious way. Director Jeff Pollack obviously doesn't possess Brooks' magic. I'm not going to lie. There are some gags that still make me laugh, but they are few and far between. For example, there's a great cameo from the always-funny Bernie Mac. And though it's a clich&eacute;d gag, I did enjoy the two Middle Eastern convenience store clerks. Keeping on the theme of ethnic stereotypes, I also liked the scene with Gedde Watanabe (of "Sixteen Candles" fame) as a Chinese waiter, who utters a very funny line in ebonics. But most of the gags are downright pathetic. Even comedy must involve a certain degree of truth, and it's hard to buy into--much less laugh at--a bunch of scenarios that make virtually no sense. In one scene, the four characters are playing cards. Jamie Foxx goes under the table to pick up a card, and the dog licks Vivica A. Fox's toes. She assumes that it's Jamie licking her. Then the dog licks Jamie's rear end, and he assumes that Vivica is licking it. Can you get a more ridiculous scenario? Not to mention the gag is poorly executed. As Jay Leno always says, "This comedy thing's not so easy, is it?" No, it is not, Jay. As is shown in amateurish comedies like this. Unfortunately, 99 percent of people in this world think they can do comedy, and about 10 percent of those people are right. On a non-cynical note, Jamie Foxx is a moderately talented comedian/actor. Unfortunately, his performance in this movie is all over the map. Like Albert Brooks said, when you do a movie you have to be funny as a person, not funny as a comedian. Foxx constantly spits out sly one-liners, like only a comedian can. He tries so hard to be funny that he rarely is. When I see him as Bunz in this movie, he reminds me of one of those obnoxious friends, who you constantly want to tell to shut the f**k up and/or punch in the face. It's no mystery that comedy is best when played straight, but obviously Foxx didn't solve that mystery prior to doing this movie. One person who hasn't solved that mystery 'til this day is Tommy Davidson. Outside of "In Living Color," I don't think I've ever found him funny. He plays the straight man this time around, but hints of his goofy style of comedy show up here and there. I haven't met one person yet, who thinks he's a comic genius. I saw his pathetic stand-up act on an episode of "The Tonight Show." Is there anything he knows how to do other than mug and make annoying voices? The third act of the film mostly centers on an utterly disgusting gag involving Davidson accidentally on his way to get castrated. First of all, if you're a guy, just hearing the "word" castration brings feelings of pain (women will NEVER understand!). Second of all, the gag might've worked if it were executed in a more discreet, tasteful way. There's a similar gag in the movie "Sour Grapes," but it's executed in a much less disgusting and much funnier way. Then again, that movie was directed by the co-creator of "Seinfeld" and "Booty Call" is made by amateurs. If you're easily pleased by gags of any sexual nature, this should be your cup of tea. Others beware.

    I haven't seen too many of these "black" comedies, only this and The Wash, but I guess it's somewhat good. The Wash was definitely better, but this is pretty much the same style, so if you like one, you probably will like the other. If the choice is between this and The Wash, I'd choose the latter. But that isn't to say that this is bad. It just isn't as good as it could've been. The plot is something a lot of guys will recognize, the hunt for a booty call. This is sort of a "what if" scenario, dealing with the question: "What if you had to go through a lot of ridiculous trials to get the booty?" And some of the trials are truly ridiculous. But far-out isn't the same as bad; a lot of the humor is good, as long as you can take some rough, gross & extreme humor. There are a lot of semi-nude scenes, and sex scenes, but never any direct nudity. I don't know if this is to open it up to more audiences; I guess there are people who don't care about sexual humor but can't stand to see some nudity. If you've seen The Wash, or something similar, and you liked it, maybe you should check this out. Just keep your expectations reasonably low, so you don't get disappointed. 6/10

    OK, now when you see a movie titled "Booty Call," you can't expect high art. But I can expect a ton of laughs. Unfortunately, now that I'm a young adult, I don't find the film as funny as I did when I saw it in grade school. When you're in grade school, you'll laugh at anything with a penis reference. Dirty and raunchy don't necessarily have to translate into dull and unfunny. Hell, even Mel Brooks was popular for doing plenty of low-brow humor, but he knows how to deliver the crudeness in a hilarious way. Director Jeff Pollack obviously doesn't possess Brooks' magic. I'm not going to lie. There are some gags that still make me laugh, but they are few and far between. For example, there's a great cameo from the always-funny Bernie Mac. And though it's a clich&eacute;d gag, I did enjoy the two Middle Eastern convenience store clerks. Keeping on the theme of ethnic stereotypes, I also liked the scene with Gedde Watanabe (of "Sixteen Candles" fame) as a Chinese waiter, who utters a very funny line in ebonics. But most of the gags are downright pathetic. Even comedy must involve a certain degree of truth, and it's hard to buy into--much less laugh at--a bunch of scenarios that make virtually no sense. In one scene, the four characters are playing cards. Jamie Foxx goes under the table to pick up a card, and the dog licks Vivica A. Fox's toes. She assumes that it's Jamie licking her. Then the dog licks Jamie's rear end, and he assumes that Vivica is licking it. Can you get a more ridiculous scenario? Not to mention the gag is poorly executed. As Jay Leno always says, "This comedy thing's not so easy, is it?" No, it is not, Jay. As is shown in amateurish comedies like this. Unfortunately, 99 percent of people in this world think they can do comedy, and about 10 percent of those people are right. On a non-cynical note, Jamie Foxx is a moderately talented comedian/actor. Unfortunately, his performance in this movie is all over the map. Like Albert Brooks said, when you do a movie you have to be funny as a person, not funny as a comedian. Foxx constantly spits out sly one-liners, like only a comedian can. He tries so hard to be funny that he rarely is. When I see him as Bunz in this movie, he reminds me of one of those obnoxious friends, who you constantly want to tell to shut the f**k up and/or punch in the face. It's no mystery that comedy is best when played straight, but obviously Foxx didn't solve that mystery prior to doing this movie. One person who hasn't solved that mystery 'til this day is Tommy Davidson. Outside of "In Living Color," I don't think I've ever found him funny. He plays the straight man this time around, but hints of his goofy style of comedy show up here and there. I haven't met one person yet, who thinks he's a comic genius. I saw his pathetic stand-up act on an episode of "The Tonight Show." Is there anything he knows how to do other than mug and make annoying voices? The third act of the film mostly centers on an utterly disgusting gag involving Davidson accidentally on his way to get castrated. First of all, if you're a guy, just hearing the "word" castration brings feelings of pain (women will NEVER understand!). Second of all, the gag might've worked if it were executed in a more discreet, tasteful way. There's a similar gag in the movie "Sour Grapes," but it's executed in a much less disgusting and much funnier way. Then again, that movie was directed by the co-creator of "Seinfeld" and "Booty Call" is made by amateurs. If you're easily pleased by gags of any sexual nature, this should be your cup of tea. Others beware.

    I haven't seen too many of these "black" comedies, only this and The Wash, but I guess it's somewhat good. The Wash was definitely better, but this is pretty much the same style, so if you like one, you probably will like the other. If the choice is between this and The Wash, I'd choose the latter. But that isn't to say that this is bad. It just isn't as good as it could've been. The plot is something a lot of guys will recognize, the hunt for a booty call. This is sort of a "what if" scenario, dealing with the question: "What if you had to go through a lot of ridiculous trials to get the booty?" And some of the trials are truly ridiculous. But far-out isn't the same as bad; a lot of the humor is good, as long as you can take some rough, gross & extreme humor. There are a lot of semi-nude scenes, and sex scenes, but never any direct nudity. I don't know if this is to open it up to more audiences; I guess there are people who don't care about sexual humor but can't stand to see some nudity. If you've seen The Wash, or something similar, and you liked it, maybe you should check this out. Just keep your expectations reasonably low, so you don't get disappointed. 6/10

    Every single man's dilemma, how can he find a direct path to the kingdom of the holy grail? In the movie Booty Call stars Bunz (Jamie Foxx) and Rushon (Tommy Davidson) as they spend one night going out on a double date. Rushon been pursuing his lady for seven weeks and tonight is the night so he brings in the reserves with his best friend Bunz to give him the luck he needs. This adventure begins innocently enough and gets mixed up with a whole bunch of twist and turns. They go from down town to up down as they eat a meal and go out to get to find the proper protection for the evening. With the dog in tow the duo hit the road and finally seems like they are settled in when all of a sudden the green light gets stopped. Good to see the style of Bernie Mac as the Rev Judge in bring in purity voice. Seeing this movie showcase some young talent before they made it big, with lots of 90s references it is a fun to go back to a simpler age and time but the path to the holy grail is not a straight shot. But always remember that the woman is how the evening is going to end and as the movie's tag line, "some guys will do anything for a little somethin' something' " A laugh a minute.

    Years before winning an Oscar for Ray, the biopic about Ray Charles, Jamie Foxx was in Booty Call, a much less serious movie. Here, he is Bunz, the best friend of Rushon(Tommy Davidson), who is dating Nikki(Tamala Jones), and they decide on a double date, adding Lysterine(Vivica A. Fox) to the mix. All is going smoothly until the couples get in the mood, but the two guys don't have protection for safe sex. Most of film entails Foxx and Davidson on a quest to find condoms and their disastrous results. Foxx has proved to be an incredibly versatile actor; from Ray, to Any Given Sunday, and even In Living Colour, the guy is a major talent. Booty Call is a silly, lightweight comedy, but Foxx and his costars make it funny and endearing. It is a one note joke, but the four major players work well together for a breezy 80 minutes.

    For those of you who don't know it, a Booty Call is is a telephone call, other communication, or visitation made with the sole intent of engaging in sex or other forms of sexual release with the person being contacted. Traditionally this social practice, especially the term booty call, is associated with a person calling another person for a sexual encounter after having already established either a casual or more serious relationship involving sexual relations. Now, stars of this film seem to have a great time, and you will too. I wish Cedric the Entertainer had been here, but hey, not all films are purrfect. 8 out of 8. See ya'll.

    I know this movie has it's critics only being rated 4.9/10, but so many characters in this movie led by Jamie Foxx were hilarious. I first saw this movie in 1999 and waited until 2006 for it's release on DVD. Booty Call is a comedy based on the dating scene and the struggle it can become; especially if you're a guy. Jamie Foxx played Bunz who was practically a dog on heat going to any length to score before sunrise, hence the movie's title Booty Call. His best mate and side kick in this adventure - Rushon who brought a serious side to the movie as he was more involved in a relationship. Along the way I found this movie really reached it's peak when the two guys visited the convenient store, where two Indian immigrants worked behind the counter who I thought added so much to this movie making it hilarious. Even Judge Peabody played by Bernie Mac delivered a great short appearance preaching the gospel and the danger's of sex even though he was on his way home with a prostitute. The movie does slow down a little towards the end when the couples visited the hospital, but still there were scenes that delivered a laugh. In all it's a short film but you will find it enjoyable from the restaurant scene in the beginning to the very end credits. And not a bad soundtrack if R & B and hip hop is your preferred choice in music. 9/10 - Based on the written material and the characters.

    Enjoyed this film from the very beginning to the end and it had me laughing until my sides hurt. Jamie Foxx, (Bunz) along with Tommy Davidson, (Rushon) gave an outstanding performance as two guys trying to score with two gals who demanded Glad Wrap and were very particular about the type of condoms the guys were going to utilize. Vivica A Fox,(Lysterine) and Tamala Jones (Nikki) gave a great supporting role as the gals who Bunz and Rushon tried to score with. This film goes all around in Chinatown, a hospital and plenty of bedrooms and even a taxi cab. If you like Jamie Foxx and love his acting and comedy, this is the film you will greatly enjoy viewing.

    One of the first Jamie Fox films I ever saw years ago and loved it! He is really funny in this movie and you could see he was going to be a big star. Its definitely not a film everyone would enjoy but if you like films like 'Friday' and anything with the Wayans brothers you will be laughing out loud. There are a good few scenes that were extremely funny, in-particular the supermarket scenes where the main characters visit several times during one crazy night and are ridiculed by the two staff who do remind me of Apu from the Simpsons. Also the scene where Rushon and Bunz (Jamie Fox) wrap themselves in cling-film made me cry with laughter! Vivica A Fox was good in the film as well but the show is stolen by Jamie Fox. Highly recommend this movie.Great 'pick me up' film.

    Comedies like this one have to be written by a team. There's too much camaraderie, inside language, specified jokesComedies like this can also be considered absolutely absurd or rather original and interesting. I go for the second option, because I was amused by how intelligently the situations presented in "Booty Call" were resolved. Two best friends. One of them has been dating, but can't get laid, so he needs the other one's help to go out on a blind date with his girlfriend's friend. The girl's friend in classy, the guy's friend is not, but somehow and ultimately they click. They go to the girl's house to play cards and things get hot; very hotHot enough to literally get into bed, just before the girls ask for a safe sex. It is after the girls ask for a safe sex that things get complicated, and the two men must go in the search of security; that sometimes can include walking a dog. But what if the dog escapes? They can calmly go to buy their things in a store; but what if the store gets robbed? They can find the Judge (cameo by the stunning Bernie Mac) and he tells them not to have sex and immediately a hot lady asks him to hurry up? What if they end up in a hospital? The movie is short, and it develops its time in the friends' adventures to get their "booties". The script by Takashi Bufford and J. Stanford Parker is well constructed and kept real enough to maintain the entertainment. It also contains some very funny sequences that, helped by the performances, show the writers' natural comedic timing. On the side of the camera, Jeff Pollack handles the job with plenty of skill, with a constant movement and rhythm, and the decision of making the image look much older than its actual time, which actually helps the movie's groove a lot. All the right calls for the man, even in terms of directing his actors; and the film's a comedy. Not your ordinary comedy, a black comedy perhaps, but not because it has black humor; because it occurs around black people. Not in the black neighborhood here precisely, but in Chinatown. Chinatown is that neighborhood that supposedly has got everything, but in the middle of the night, when two friends are in need for condoms, it is practically deserted. The performances fill the movie with motivation. The two pals are played by Tommy Davidson and Jamie Foxx (am I the only person that hasn't seen "Ray"?), both from the series "In Living Color", but the latter one fresh from his "The Jamie Foxx Show". Davidson stay calm until moments he looses it and we laugh; Foxx is a genius with all the one-liners and direct commentaries that keep you feeling him until the credits roll. Vivica A. Fox plays the classy Lysterine, and she excels constantly. Today she is between the highest paid black actresses of the industry. Tamala Jones also got some roles after this film, and she is still working today. She has the innocent look but the killing attitude. It's like that with all the African-Americans really; they want to be aside. I don't mean the people in this film, but there are lots of examples, and it's a topic I would be pleased to deal with.

My hand was poised on the remote, ready to turn it off, but my fingers wouldn't press the button." .......... All I'm gonna say is what kind of moron watches a scene that they find to be "funny" and wants to turn the movie off. If in fact you actually got booty calls you would understand the humor in this movie, or if you were even the least bit intelligent, you would realize the stupidity of your comment....... You don't turn a movie off upon seeing a scene that you find funny..... Unless you are moron..... enough said. Also... Why in gods name are you "embarressed" by a movie like this..... Its hilarious. Go get a life, and a booty call..... you just might understand this movie.

They go to the girl's house to play cards and things get hot; very hotHot enough to literally get into bed, just before the girls ask for a safe sex. It is after the girls ask for a safe sex that things get complicated, and the two men must go in the search of security; that sometimes can include walking a dog. But what if the dog escapes? They can calmly go to buy their things in a store; but what if the store gets robbed? They can find the Judge (cameo by the stunning Bernie Mac) and he tells them not to have sex and immediately a hot lady asks him to hurry up? What if they end up in a hospital? The movie is short, and it develops its time in the friends' adventures to get their "booties". The script by Takashi Bufford and J. Stanford Parker is well constructed and kept real enough to maintain the entertainment. It also contains some very funny sequences that, helped by the performances, show the writers' natural comedic timing. On the side of the camera, Jeff Pollack handles the job with plenty of skill, with a constant movement and rhythm, and the decision of making the image look much older than its actual time, which actually helps the movie's groove a lot. All the right calls for the man, even in terms of directing his actors; and the film's a comedy. Not your ordinary comedy, a black comedy perhaps, but not because it has black humor; because it occurs around black people. Not in the black neighborhood here precisely, but in Chinatown. Chinatown is that neighborhood that supposedly has got everything, but in the middle of the night, when two friends are in need for condoms, it is practically deserted. The performances fill the movie with motivation. The two pals are played by Tommy Davidson and Jamie Foxx (am I the only person that hasn't seen "Ray"?), both from the series "In Living Color", but the latter one fresh from his "The Jamie Foxx Show". Davidson stay calm until moments he looses it and we laugh; Foxx is a genius with all the one-liners and direct commentaries that keep you feeling him until the credits roll. Vivica A. Fox plays the classy Lysterine, and she excels constantly. Today she is between the highest paid black actresses of the industry. Tamala Jones also got some roles after this film, and she is still working today. She has the innocent look but the killing attitude. It's like that with all the African-Americans really; they want to be aside. I don't mean the people in this film, but there are lots of examples, and it's a topic I would be pleased to deal with.

    I'm writing this in response to the obvious moron that wrote the following quote.........."Watched the funny Chinese restaurant scene and figured that would be it. My hand was poised on the remote, ready to turn it off, but my fingers wouldn't press the button." .......... All I'm gonna say is what kind of moron watches a scene that they find to be "funny" and wants to turn the movie off. If in fact you actually got booty calls you would understand the humor in this movie, or if you were even the least bit intelligent, you would realize the stupidity of your comment....... You don't turn a movie off upon seeing a scene that you find funny..... Unless you are moron..... enough said. Also... Why in gods name are you "embarressed" by a movie like this..... Its hilarious. Go get a life, and a booty call..... you just might understand this movie.

    OK, now when you see a movie titled "Booty Call," you can't expect high art. But I can expect a ton of laughs. Unfortunately, now that I'm a young adult, I don't find the film as funny as I did when I saw it in grade school. When you're in grade school, you'll laugh at anything with a penis reference. Dirty and raunchy don't necessarily have to translate into dull and unfunny. Hell, even Mel Brooks was popular for doing plenty of low-brow humor, but he knows how to deliver the crudeness in a hilarious way. Director Jeff Pollack obviously doesn't possess Brooks' magic. I'm not going to lie. There are some gags that still make me laugh, but they are few and far between. For example, there's a great cameo from the always-funny Bernie Mac. And though it's a clich&eacute;d gag, I did enjoy the two Middle Eastern convenience store clerks. Keeping on the theme of ethnic stereotypes, I also liked the scene with Gedde Watanabe (of "Sixteen Candles" fame) as a Chinese waiter, who utters a very funny line in ebonics. But most of the gags are downright pathetic. Even comedy must involve a certain degree of truth, and it's hard to buy into--much less laugh at--a bunch of scenarios that make virtually no sense. In one scene, the four characters are playing cards. Jamie Foxx goes under the table to pick up a card, and the dog licks Vivica A. Fox's toes. She assumes that it's Jamie licking her. Then the dog licks Jamie's rear end, and he assumes that Vivica is licking it. Can you get a more ridiculous scenario? Not to mention the gag is poorly executed. As Jay Leno always says, "This comedy thing's not so easy, is it?" No, it is not, Jay. As is shown in amateurish comedies like this. Unfortunately, 99 percent of people in this world think they can do comedy, and about 10 percent of those people are right. On a non-cynical note, Jamie Foxx is a moderately talented comedian/actor. Unfortunately, his performance in this movie is all over the map. Like Albert Brooks said, when you do a movie you have to be funny as a person, not funny as a comedian. Foxx constantly spits out sly one-liners, like only a comedian can. He tries so hard to be funny that he rarely is. When I see him as Bunz in this movie, he reminds me of one of those obnoxious friends, who you constantly want to tell to shut the f**k up and/or punch in the face. It's no mystery that comedy is best when played straight, but obviously Foxx didn't solve that mystery prior to doing this movie. One person who hasn't solved that mystery 'til this day is Tommy Davidson. Outside of "In Living Color," I don't think I've ever found him funny. He plays the straight man this time around, but hints of his goofy style of comedy show up here and there. I haven't met one person yet, who thinks he's a comic genius. I saw his pathetic stand-up act on an episode of "The Tonight Show." Is there anything he knows how to do other than mug and make annoying voices? The third act of the film mostly centers on an utterly disgusting gag involving Davidson accidentally on his way to get castrated. First of all, if you're a guy, just hearing the "word" castration brings feelings of pain (women will NEVER understand!). Second of all, the gag might've worked if it were executed in a more discreet, tasteful way. There's a similar gag in the movie "Sour Grapes," but it's executed in a much less disgusting and much funnier way. Then again, that movie was directed by the co-creator of "Seinfeld" and "Booty Call" is made by amateurs. If you're easily pleased by gags of any sexual nature, this should be your cup of tea. Others beware.

    I haven't seen too many of these "black" comedies, only this and The Wash, but I guess it's somewhat good. The Wash was definitely better, but this is pretty much the same style, so if you like one, you probably will like the other. If the choice is between this and The Wash, I'd choose the latter. But that isn't to say that this is bad. It just isn't as good as it could've been. The plot is something a lot of guys will recognize, the hunt for a booty call. This is sort of a "what if" scenario, dealing with the question: "What if you had to go through a lot of ridiculous trials to get the booty?" And some of the trials are truly ridiculous. But far-out isn't the same as bad; a lot of the humor is good, as long as you can take some rough, gross & extreme humor. There are a lot of semi-nude scenes, and sex scenes, but never any direct nudity. I don't know if this is to open it up to more audiences; I guess there are people who don't care about sexual humor but can't stand to see some nudity. If you've seen The Wash, or something similar, and you liked it, maybe you should check this out. Just keep your expectations reasonably low, so you don't get disappointed. 6/10
