    The life story of "Evita" as portrayed by pop singer Madonna and directed by Alan Parker. For someone knowing very little about the subject, this film is a quite a chore to sit through. It's over two hours long, without much plot, and we begins with the elaborate funeral of its lead character. Since the subject, Eva Duarte, was evidently engaging, and played by another fascinating woman, the film is disappointing. In one scene, she gives away money by throwing it at people. The material girl's jewels and wardrobe must be worth millions... Lost is why so many remember Evita, but forget Michael J. Brody Jr.... The story is told in operatic fashion. Yet, it is not a traditional opera, or musical - it is like a silent film in color, with dubbed songs and a synchronized sound effects track. In lieu of title cards, handsome Antonio Banderas (as Che) sings about the woman he professes to dislike, but we know he really loves. The dubbing works best with Madonna, who is quite convincing in her "sing acting" - especially on the film's best song, "Don't Cry for Me, Argentina" (a great one, composed by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber), but the melding of music and motion picture is otherwise mechanical. The film lacks heart. ***** Evita (12/14/96) Alan Parker ~ Madonna, Antonio Banderas, Jonathan Pryce, Jimmy Nail

    Good heavens! This film lasted 135 mins - 120-odd mins too long!(there were a couple of good songs). What possessed someone to think, "Hhmm, let's get the cast to tunelessly 'sing' their lines ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE FILM"?!?!? Don't get me wrong, it was quite visually stunning, a great snapshot of a tumultuous historical turning point and all that, but PLEASE, how did people sit through two hours of that?? Despite the film's saving graces (and there were a few), this still makes it into my worst films of all time list, purely because I found it impossible to sit through from start to finish without wanting to pour red-hot magma into my ears!

    Although musicals were a highly theatrical form during the last quarter of the twentieth century, the traditional cinema musical declined during this period; "Evita" was one of the few stage musicals to transfer to the cinema screen. Most cinematic musicals of the period ("Fame" being a good example and "Grease" a rare exception) generally use spoken dialogue to convey emotion, with the characters only singing and dancing in situations where people would sing and dance in real life. "Evita", however, goes to the opposite extreme. It is more like an opera than to a traditional musical, with little spoken dialogue, almost everything being sung. &nbsp; Eva Per&oacute;n was, and remains, a controversial figure, both in her native Argentina and internationally, but there can be little doubt that she was also a remarkable one. (I cannot imagine any other female political leader from Latin America who could have inspired a hit musical). "Evita" has always had a special interest for me, both as a stage production and as a film, because I used to have an Argentine girlfriend, and our first date was to see the stage version; she was able to explain a lot of the political background to me. Eva's husband Juan Per&oacute;n is often thought of, at least in Europe and North America, as a "fascist", but (as my girlfriend was quick to point out) there was a big difference between him and other Latin American leaders referred to by this term. The likes of Pinochet, Stroessner and Galtieri were military strongmen who ruled by force of arms; any support they might have enjoyed among the civilian population came largely from their countries' upper classes. Per&oacute;n, by contrast, was a populist leader with links to the trade unions who enjoyed strong working-class support. Despite his military background he was distrusted by his fellow military leaders and loathed by Argentina's social elite, who saw him as a jumped-up demagogue. Although his regime was undoubtedly an authoritarian one, he was also responsible for instituting many social reforms, and the strength of his legacy can be gauged by the fact that since 1946, Peronist candidates have won eight of the ten Argentine presidential elections that they have not been banned from participating in; the current president, Cristina Kirchner, is a Peronist. Eva played an important role in her husband's rise to power, rallying his supporters when he was arrested by the military dictatorship, and during his time in office she was virtually canonised by the party faithful, who saw her as the "spiritual leader of the nation". The film, like the stage musical, traces her life from her impoverished childhood, through her rise to fame as an actress, her marriage to Per&oacute;n and her time as first lady to her tragic death from cancer at the age of 33. The film essentially tells the same story as the stage show, but makes two major changes. In the stage production, Eva leaves her first lover, the singer Agust&iacute;n Magaldi; in the film he abandons her to return to his wife. The reason, it seems, is to make the young Eva a more sympathetic and vulnerable character, and possibly also to give Madonna the chance to perform one of the show's hit songs, "Another Suitcase in Another Hall", which on stage is sung by Per&oacute;n's mistress. The second major change concerns the character of Che, who here becomes an everyman figure and is not identified with the historical Che Guevara. (It is said that the left-leaning director Alan Parker made this change because he did not like the way Guevara, an idol of the Left, had been treated by the right-leaning lyricist Tim Rice). If anything, the "Che" of the movie is more of a disillusioned Peronist- we see him marching as one of the "descamisados" who sweep Per&oacute;n to power- than a Communist. Madonna has not always struck me as the world's greatest actress, and it was a brave move on Parker's part to cast her here ahead of established actresses like Liza Minnelli and Michelle Pfeiffer. Although she had given decent performances in films like "Desperately Seeking Susan" and "A League of their Own", she had also given some lousy ones, "Body of Evidence" being a notorious example. Parker's gamble paid off; Madonna had campaigned hard for the part, describing it as a "role she was born to play", and was able to make good her boast. She gives here the greatest acting performance of her career, able to bring out all the contrasting sides of Eva's personality, making her not merely a strong and determined woman but also a vulnerable and tragic one. Madonna, of course, was a singer before she was an actress, so may have been helped by the fact that her role is almost entirely sung rather than spoken. Jonathan Pryce is also good as Per&oacute;n, played here less passionate and less determined than his wife, but also a wily political opportunist. Antonio Banderas makes a charismatic Che, although I felt his singing voice was not always up to the role. The film's great strength, of course, is the combination of Rice's lyrics and Andrew Lloyd Webber's music, which combine to produce some of the most memorable songs in the modern musical theatre. Sometimes these are mordantly cynical ("Oh What a Circus", "Goodnight and Thank You", "Peron's Latest Flame"), sometimes lyrical and poignant.( "Another Suitcase in Another Hall", "Don't Cry for Me Argentina"), and sometimes they manage to combine both moods ("I'd Be Surprisingly Good for You"). I should also mention Parker's direction and his ability to find striking visual images to complement the songs. "Evita" triumphantly proved that, even in the nineties, there was still life in the cinematic musical. A goof. We see Magaldi performing at a concert in 1944, which would have been clever of him, given that he died in 1938.

    I had first heard about Evita through a parody: "SCTV" did a parody ad for a musical called "Indira" about Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi (portrayed by Andrea Martin) which had her singing "Don't Cry for Me, Argentina" with Slim Whitman (Joe Flaherty) warbling the male part before segueing to another song. I then saw the actual commercials for "Evita" with, I think, Patti LuPone and Mandy Patinkin doing those songs I previously saw spoofed on that "SCTV" spot. So over 30 years later, I finally watched the film version of the Andrew Lloyd Webber-Tim Rice musical with Madonna essaying the title role. She's quite good singing songs different from her set list especially on the one original song for the movie-"You Must Love Me". Having her veer from caring to shallow and back was also partly natural especially considering the contradictory versions of Evita's life I read about recounted on Wikipedia after seeing the movie. So, yes, she deserves high praise for taking this role and gets much help from both Antonio Banderas as Che and Jonathan Pryce as Eva's eventual husband, Juan Peron. In summary, I highly enjoyed Evita.

    I am a fan of great musicals ... in this effort I've sat thru a lot of bad ones ('Show Boat', 'Carousel', 'The King and I', etc) ... well you have to wade thru the crap to get to the good stuff such as 'My Fair Lady' (imho the best of all-time) and 'Sound of Music', perhaps 'Chicago' and I'd even put 'jesus Christ Superstar' in that realm (tho again, don't think it's going to be a perfectly accurate biblical retelling) ... not sure why people go to musical theatre to see 'history' ... it has little to nothing to do with it ... but of course Evita has been subject to this criteria since it was a record rock opera OK so 'sound of music wasn't historical accurate either ... get over it ... maria was not the Julie Andrews, everyone's idyllic nanny/mother/saint/whore fantasy ... the real maria was a hateful slave-driving bitch of a stage mother who i am eternally surprised wasn't murdered by those kids ... 'so long, farewell, Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye, i must be jabbing this ice pick in your eye' -- far more accurate ... so let's try and put aside the historical and we'll stick to the musical ... which, in not uncertain terms, is a truly great piece of musical theatre ... i never went to see it when originally out on the theatres and frankly had no interest involving anything Madonna was associated with ... but when it made it to cable i happened to leave it on one day was was floored by Antonia Banderas' performance ... much like the the Stage Manager in 'Our Town', has to carry much of the performance by acting like the Greek chorus and adding little bits of info to help us understand some of the finer points ... not to mention give some of the characters a hard time which is pretty delightful all in all ... he is fabulous and really makes the movie move and work Madonna of course has had plenty of accolades for her performance and it is deserved ... she plays it perfectly ... Alan Parker delivers another great adaptation of a musical (Pink Floyd's 'The Wall' being the other) and perhaps he should do more of these ... he seems to have a good touch with them ... but the musical is really the dynamo that keeps the play surging along ... I am not a fan of most Spanish music, I'm a big fan of most music just not Spanish ... but this music is well done and doesn't annoy me at all ... so perhaps it's not so Spanish ... the final scene between Evita and Che as they have their dance during Evita's surgery hallucination is as good as any scene ever in any musical ... the musical is surging and moving and the dance of desire and disgust is perfect as the betrayed everyman represented by Che and the haughty Evita as truly a great climax to the play ... this is well worth several viewings since there are subtleties especially in Banderas' performance that had so much wit and humor that they should not be missed

    I usually try to keep my opinions to myself until I actually review a film on IMDb, but this time I got on my feet and I booed with the rest of the angry mob. I would have thrown fruit if I'd had some. This is the silliest thing to come out of South America since the movie "Medell&iacute;n". It's overacted, it's under-directed and it's paced like a SNAIL. Oh, and did I mention it's long? You know, it's a real disappointment for me because I had Madonna on my list of stars to watch in 1994. And now I think I'm gonna have her on my list of stars to watch fade in 1996.

    I can't tell you how disappointing this film is. The stage version is brilliant and this miscast, misdirected film version is a complete failure. Note; Madonna only received a Golden Globe Award which is SO telling! I'm convinced the GG can be purchased. All kinds of songs were chopped and there was no choreography! Go see the stage version! Madonna's weakness as a singer is clear. She should stick to pop music and video "acting". The wardrobe was done very well but certainly not enough of a reason to see this waste of money. What a shame that every big actress in town wanted this role and this is how it wound up. All of the men were miscast as well. Especially Magaldi.

    Ignore the IMDb average rating, which is increasingly becoming worse at indicating the quality of a film. In the interim between 1978 and 1996, the story had become more timely. Those watching the film in 1997 couldn't have failed to see the parallel between this and Princess Diana's death. Comparing the two gives some idea of how the Argetinians felt towards Eva. Madonna proves to be an ideal choice. I've never been particularly interested in Madonna, but she captures the attention of the audience throughout. She plays her journey from naive girl to politicised woman smoothly and believably, seeming to identify with Eva on some level. Vocally, she does not have a musical theatre voice but then Broadway belting isn't appropriate in a modern movie musicals. Her voice is thin but very pleasant to listen to and appropriately intimate for songs like "Another Suitcase in Another Hall" (which in the stage version is sung by a minor character) and "I'd Be Surprisingly Good For You". Eva's methods of getting to the top- bed-hopping until she finds the right bed- may seem dubious, but it's not inconceivable to think that a beautiful young woman with no social standing would use all that she does have to climb to a position where she won't need to use that. Because Eva does seem genuinely nice, Che (Antonio Banderas) becomes less sympathetic. Che is the working man who appears throughout Eva's life in various guises, casting doubt on whether she is nothing more than an actress. Banderas' voice has character and it works well with the film but it's not a very musical voice. Perhaps it is appropriate that this working class man, the voice of reality, should have a rougher voice. As Juan Peron, Jonathan Pryce's part is relatively small yet he remains convincing. He's no great singer but the acting that comes through in his singing more than compensates. His love for Eva and her love for him is completely believable, almost heartbreaking. Those unfamiliar with South American politics may find themselves confused at points in the film but the story is abstract enough to have power on its own, and perhaps is best treated as that rather than a historical documentary. The film is also completely sung-through, apart from a few lines, so fans of Les Miserables and Phantom of The Opera should definitely watch this. For those who aren't used to that style, if you keep an open mind, you'll find yourself swept along, as happened with The Artist. Unlike some of his other musicals, Andrew Lloyd Webber (with Tim Rice as lyricist) has created songs that are fully integrated into the narrative. Evita is one of his more sophisticated shows and proof that the dichotomy between popular musicals and serious musicals is false. "Don't Cry For Me Argentina" is the most well-known but there are many great ones: "Oh What A Circus", "Good Night and Good Luck", "I'd Be Surprisingly Good For You", etc. Films with this emotional power are rare, so track it down now!

    The film was fairly good, the music great, Antonio Banderas brilliant as always. However, it was a huge mistake to cast Madonna as Eva Peron, even though she did her level best. Elaine Paige would have been a hundred times better as she has a much better voice and is a much better actor. Watched it in the cinema with my family and clearly Madonna was misplaced, out of her depth and just didn't have the acting skills needed in such an otherwise great production. Elaine Paige had already performed the musical on stage many times, and would have been the natural choice, but unfortunately she wasn't allowed to shine in the movie adaptation.

    I never liked musicals much, and this one is definitely not an exception. Too much music and too little (hi)story... In addition, the movie is also ideologically and politically very clearly oriented to the left, which doesn't help. It simply isn't true that the 'Peronistas' where all good guys, and the others all bad... Who knows, absurdly though, if the military had stayed in power longer like in Chile, maybe Argentina wouldn't have gotten into the sort of financial troubles that have ravaged a once rich and prosperous nation and almost destroyed it altogether (and please note that I am no way a militarist at all)! Surprisingly, the only thing I appreciated was Madonna's singing, which was very good. Otherwise the movie was average.

Most cinematic musicals of the period ("Fame" being a good example and "Grease" a rare exception) generally use spoken dialogue to convey emotion, with the characters only singing and dancing in situations where people would sing and dance in real life. "Evita", however, goes to the opposite extreme. It is more like an opera than to a traditional musical, with little spoken dialogue, almost everything being sung. &nbsp; Eva Per&oacute;n was, and remains, a controversial figure, both in her native Argentina and internationally, but there can be little doubt that she was also a remarkable one. (I cannot imagine any other female political leader from Latin America who could have inspired a hit musical). "Evita" has always had a special interest for me, both as a stage production and as a film, because I used to have an Argentine girlfriend, and our first date was to see the stage version; she was able to explain a lot of the political background to me. Eva's husband Juan Per&oacute;n is often thought of, at least in Europe and North America, as a "fascist", but (as my girlfriend was quick to point out) there was a big difference between him and other Latin American leaders referred to by this term. The likes of Pinochet, Stroessner and Galtieri were military strongmen who ruled by force of arms; any support they might have enjoyed among the civilian population came largely from their countries' upper classes. Per&oacute;n, by contrast, was a populist leader with links to the trade unions who enjoyed strong working-class support. Despite his military background he was distrusted by his fellow military leaders and loathed by Argentina's social elite, who saw him as a jumped-up demagogue. Although his regime was undoubtedly an authoritarian one, he was also responsible for instituting many social reforms, and the strength of his legacy can be gauged by the fact that since 1946, Peronist candidates have won eight of the ten Argentine presidential elections that they have not been banned from participating in; the current president, Cristina Kirchner, is a Peronist. Eva played an important role in her husband's rise to power, rallying his supporters when he was arrested by the military dictatorship, and during his time in office she was virtually canonised by the party faithful, who saw her as the "spiritual leader of the nation". The film, like the stage musical, traces her life from her impoverished childhood, through her rise to fame as an actress, her marriage to Per&oacute;n and her time as first lady to her tragic death from cancer at the age of 33. The film essentially tells the same story as the stage show, but makes two major changes. In the stage production, Eva leaves her first lover, the singer Agust&iacute;n Magaldi; in the film he abandons her to return to his wife. The reason, it seems, is to make the young Eva a more sympathetic and vulnerable character, and possibly also to give Madonna the chance to perform one of the show's hit songs, "Another Suitcase in Another Hall", which on stage is sung by Per&oacute;n's mistress. The second major change concerns the character of Che, who here becomes an everyman figure and is not identified with the historical Che Guevara. (It is said that the left-leaning director Alan Parker made this change because he did not like the way Guevara, an idol of the Left, had been treated by the right-leaning lyricist Tim Rice). If anything, the "Che" of the movie is more of a disillusioned Peronist- we see him marching as one of the "descamisados" who sweep Per&oacute;n to power- than a Communist. Madonna has not always struck me as the world's greatest actress, and it was a brave move on Parker's part to cast her here ahead of established actresses like Liza Minnelli and Michelle Pfeiffer. Although she had given decent performances in films like "Desperately Seeking Susan" and "A League of their Own", she had also given some lousy ones, "Body of Evidence" being a notorious example. Parker's gamble paid off; Madonna had campaigned hard for the part, describing it as a "role she was born to play", and was able to make good her boast. She gives here the greatest acting performance of her career, able to bring out all the contrasting sides of Eva's personality, making her not merely a strong and determined woman but also a vulnerable and tragic one. Madonna, of course, was a singer before she was an actress, so may have been helped by the fact that her role is almost entirely sung rather than spoken. Jonathan Pryce is also good as Per&oacute;n, played here less passionate and less determined than his wife, but also a wily political opportunist. Antonio Banderas makes a charismatic Che, although I felt his singing voice was not always up to the role. The film's great strength, of course, is the combination of Rice's lyrics and Andrew Lloyd Webber's music, which combine to produce some of the most memorable songs in the modern musical theatre. Sometimes these are mordantly cynical ("Oh What a Circus", "Goodnight and Thank You", "Peron's Latest Flame"), sometimes lyrical and poignant.( "Another Suitcase in Another Hall", "Don't Cry for Me Argentina"), and sometimes they manage to combine both moods ("I'd Be Surprisingly Good for You"). I should also mention Parker's direction and his ability to find striking visual images to complement the songs. "Evita" triumphantly proved that, even in the nineties, there was still life in the cinematic musical. A goof. We see Magaldi performing at a concert in 1944, which would have been clever of him, given that he died in 1938.

In summary, I highly enjoyed Evita.

    I am a fan of great musicals ... in this effort I've sat thru a lot of bad ones ('Show Boat', 'Carousel', 'The King and I', etc) ... well you have to wade thru the crap to get to the good stuff such as 'My Fair Lady' (imho the best of all-time) and 'Sound of Music', perhaps 'Chicago' and I'd even put 'jesus Christ Superstar' in that realm (tho again, don't think it's going to be a perfectly accurate biblical retelling) ... not sure why people go to musical theatre to see 'history' ... it has little to nothing to do with it ... but of course Evita has been subject to this criteria since it was a record rock opera OK so 'sound of music wasn't historical accurate either ... get over it ... maria was not the Julie Andrews, everyone's idyllic nanny/mother/saint/whore fantasy ... the real maria was a hateful slave-driving bitch of a stage mother who i am eternally surprised wasn't murdered by those kids ... 'so long, farewell, Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye, i must be jabbing this ice pick in your eye' -- far more accurate ... so let's try and put aside the historical and we'll stick to the musical ... which, in not uncertain terms, is a truly great piece of musical theatre ... i never went to see it when originally out on the theatres and frankly had no interest involving anything Madonna was associated with ... but when it made it to cable i happened to leave it on one day was was floored by Antonia Banderas' performance ... much like the the Stage Manager in 'Our Town', has to carry much of the performance by acting like the Greek chorus and adding little bits of info to help us understand some of the finer points ... not to mention give some of the characters a hard time which is pretty delightful all in all ... he is fabulous and really makes the movie move and work Madonna of course has had plenty of accolades for her performance and it is deserved ... she plays it perfectly ... Alan Parker delivers another great adaptation of a musical (Pink Floyd's 'The Wall' being the other) and perhaps he should do more of these ... he seems to have a good touch with them ... but the musical is really the dynamo that keeps the play surging along ... I am not a fan of most Spanish music, I'm a big fan of most music just not Spanish ... but this music is well done and doesn't annoy me at all ... so perhaps it's not so Spanish ... the final scene between Evita and Che as they have their dance during Evita's surgery hallucination is as good as any scene ever in any musical ... the musical is surging and moving and the dance of desire and disgust is perfect as the betrayed everyman represented by Che and the haughty Evita as truly a great climax to the play ... this is well worth several viewings since there are subtleties especially in Banderas' performance that had so much wit and humor that they should not be missed

    I usually try to keep my opinions to myself until I actually review a film on IMDb, but this time I got on my feet and I booed with the rest of the angry mob. I would have thrown fruit if I'd had some. This is the silliest thing to come out of South America since the movie "Medell&iacute;n". It's overacted, it's under-directed and it's paced like a SNAIL. Oh, and did I mention it's long? You know, it's a real disappointment for me because I had Madonna on my list of stars to watch in 1994. And now I think I'm gonna have her on my list of stars to watch fade in 1996.

    I can't tell you how disappointing this film is. The stage version is brilliant and this miscast, misdirected film version is a complete failure. Note; Madonna only received a Golden Globe Award which is SO telling! I'm convinced the GG can be purchased. All kinds of songs were chopped and there was no choreography! Go see the stage version! Madonna's weakness as a singer is clear. She should stick to pop music and video "acting". The wardrobe was done very well but certainly not enough of a reason to see this waste of money. What a shame that every big actress in town wanted this role and this is how it wound up. All of the men were miscast as well. Especially Magaldi.

    Ignore the IMDb average rating, which is increasingly becoming worse at indicating the quality of a film. In the interim between 1978 and 1996, the story had become more timely. Those watching the film in 1997 couldn't have failed to see the parallel between this and Princess Diana's death. Comparing the two gives some idea of how the Argetinians felt towards Eva. Madonna proves to be an ideal choice. I've never been particularly interested in Madonna, but she captures the attention of the audience throughout. She plays her journey from naive girl to politicised woman smoothly and believably, seeming to identify with Eva on some level. Vocally, she does not have a musical theatre voice but then Broadway belting isn't appropriate in a modern movie musicals. Her voice is thin but very pleasant to listen to and appropriately intimate for songs like "Another Suitcase in Another Hall" (which in the stage version is sung by a minor character) and "I'd Be Surprisingly Good For You". Eva's methods of getting to the top- bed-hopping until she finds the right bed- may seem dubious, but it's not inconceivable to think that a beautiful young woman with no social standing would use all that she does have to climb to a position where she won't need to use that. Because Eva does seem genuinely nice, Che (Antonio Banderas) becomes less sympathetic. Che is the working man who appears throughout Eva's life in various guises, casting doubt on whether she is nothing more than an actress. Banderas' voice has character and it works well with the film but it's not a very musical voice. Perhaps it is appropriate that this working class man, the voice of reality, should have a rougher voice. As Juan Peron, Jonathan Pryce's part is relatively small yet he remains convincing. He's no great singer but the acting that comes through in his singing more than compensates. His love for Eva and her love for him is completely believable, almost heartbreaking. Those unfamiliar with South American politics may find themselves confused at points in the film but the story is abstract enough to have power on its own, and perhaps is best treated as that rather than a historical documentary. The film is also completely sung-through, apart from a few lines, so fans of Les Miserables and Phantom of The Opera should definitely watch this. For those who aren't used to that style, if you keep an open mind, you'll find yourself swept along, as happened with The Artist. Unlike some of his other musicals, Andrew Lloyd Webber (with Tim Rice as lyricist) has created songs that are fully integrated into the narrative. Evita is one of his more sophisticated shows and proof that the dichotomy between popular musicals and serious musicals is false. "Don't Cry For Me Argentina" is the most well-known but there are many great ones: "Oh What A Circus", "Good Night and Good Luck", "I'd Be Surprisingly Good For You", etc. Films with this emotional power are rare, so track it down now!

    The film was fairly good, the music great, Antonio Banderas brilliant as always. However, it was a huge mistake to cast Madonna as Eva Peron, even though she did her level best. Elaine Paige would have been a hundred times better as she has a much better voice and is a much better actor. Watched it in the cinema with my family and clearly Madonna was misplaced, out of her depth and just didn't have the acting skills needed in such an otherwise great production. Elaine Paige had already performed the musical on stage many times, and would have been the natural choice, but unfortunately she wasn't allowed to shine in the movie adaptation.

    I never liked musicals much, and this one is definitely not an exception. Too much music and too little (hi)story... In addition, the movie is also ideologically and politically very clearly oriented to the left, which doesn't help. It simply isn't true that the 'Peronistas' where all good guys, and the others all bad... Who knows, absurdly though, if the military had stayed in power longer like in Chile, maybe Argentina wouldn't have gotten into the sort of financial troubles that have ravaged a once rich and prosperous nation and almost destroyed it altogether (and please note that I am no way a militarist at all)! Surprisingly, the only thing I appreciated was Madonna's singing, which was very good. Otherwise the movie was average.

    The life story of "Evita" as portrayed by pop singer Madonna and directed by Alan Parker. For someone knowing very little about the subject, this film is a quite a chore to sit through. It's over two hours long, without much plot, and we begins with the elaborate funeral of its lead character. Since the subject, Eva Duarte, was evidently engaging, and played by another fascinating woman, the film is disappointing. In one scene, she gives away money by throwing it at people. The material girl's jewels and wardrobe must be worth millions... Lost is why so many remember Evita, but forget Michael J. Brody Jr.... The story is told in operatic fashion. Yet, it is not a traditional opera, or musical - it is like a silent film in color, with dubbed songs and a synchronized sound effects track. In lieu of title cards, handsome Antonio Banderas (as Che) sings about the woman he professes to dislike, but we know he really loves. The dubbing works best with Madonna, who is quite convincing in her "sing acting" - especially on the film's best song, "Don't Cry for Me, Argentina" (a great one, composed by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber), but the melding of music and motion picture is otherwise mechanical. The film lacks heart. ***** Evita (12/14/96) Alan Parker ~ Madonna, Antonio Banderas, Jonathan Pryce, Jimmy Nail

    Good heavens! This film lasted 135 mins - 120-odd mins too long!(there were a couple of good songs). What possessed someone to think, "Hhmm, let's get the cast to tunelessly 'sing' their lines ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE FILM"?!?!? Don't get me wrong, it was quite visually stunning, a great snapshot of a tumultuous historical turning point and all that, but PLEASE, how did people sit through two hours of that?? Despite the film's saving graces (and there were a few), this still makes it into my worst films of all time list, purely because I found it impossible to sit through from start to finish without wanting to pour red-hot magma into my ears!

    Although musicals were a highly theatrical form during the last quarter of the twentieth century, the traditional cinema musical declined during this period; "Evita" was one of the few stage musicals to transfer to the cinema screen. Most cinematic musicals of the period ("Fame" being a good example and "Grease" a rare exception) generally use spoken dialogue to convey emotion, with the characters only singing and dancing in situations where people would sing and dance in real life. "Evita", however, goes to the opposite extreme. It is more like an opera than to a traditional musical, with little spoken dialogue, almost everything being sung. &nbsp; Eva Per&oacute;n was, and remains, a controversial figure, both in her native Argentina and internationally, but there can be little doubt that she was also a remarkable one. (I cannot imagine any other female political leader from Latin America who could have inspired a hit musical). "Evita" has always had a special interest for me, both as a stage production and as a film, because I used to have an Argentine girlfriend, and our first date was to see the stage version; she was able to explain a lot of the political background to me. Eva's husband Juan Per&oacute;n is often thought of, at least in Europe and North America, as a "fascist", but (as my girlfriend was quick to point out) there was a big difference between him and other Latin American leaders referred to by this term. The likes of Pinochet, Stroessner and Galtieri were military strongmen who ruled by force of arms; any support they might have enjoyed among the civilian population came largely from their countries' upper classes. Per&oacute;n, by contrast, was a populist leader with links to the trade unions who enjoyed strong working-class support. Despite his military background he was distrusted by his fellow military leaders and loathed by Argentina's social elite, who saw him as a jumped-up demagogue. Although his regime was undoubtedly an authoritarian one, he was also responsible for instituting many social reforms, and the strength of his legacy can be gauged by the fact that since 1946, Peronist candidates have won eight of the ten Argentine presidential elections that they have not been banned from participating in; the current president, Cristina Kirchner, is a Peronist. Eva played an important role in her husband's rise to power, rallying his supporters when he was arrested by the military dictatorship, and during his time in office she was virtually canonised by the party faithful, who saw her as the "spiritual leader of the nation". The film, like the stage musical, traces her life from her impoverished childhood, through her rise to fame as an actress, her marriage to Per&oacute;n and her time as first lady to her tragic death from cancer at the age of 33. The film essentially tells the same story as the stage show, but makes two major changes. In the stage production, Eva leaves her first lover, the singer Agust&iacute;n Magaldi; in the film he abandons her to return to his wife. The reason, it seems, is to make the young Eva a more sympathetic and vulnerable character, and possibly also to give Madonna the chance to perform one of the show's hit songs, "Another Suitcase in Another Hall", which on stage is sung by Per&oacute;n's mistress. The second major change concerns the character of Che, who here becomes an everyman figure and is not identified with the historical Che Guevara. (It is said that the left-leaning director Alan Parker made this change because he did not like the way Guevara, an idol of the Left, had been treated by the right-leaning lyricist Tim Rice). If anything, the "Che" of the movie is more of a disillusioned Peronist- we see him marching as one of the "descamisados" who sweep Per&oacute;n to power- than a Communist. Madonna has not always struck me as the world's greatest actress, and it was a brave move on Parker's part to cast her here ahead of established actresses like Liza Minnelli and Michelle Pfeiffer. Although she had given decent performances in films like "Desperately Seeking Susan" and "A League of their Own", she had also given some lousy ones, "Body of Evidence" being a notorious example. Parker's gamble paid off; Madonna had campaigned hard for the part, describing it as a "role she was born to play", and was able to make good her boast. She gives here the greatest acting performance of her career, able to bring out all the contrasting sides of Eva's personality, making her not merely a strong and determined woman but also a vulnerable and tragic one. Madonna, of course, was a singer before she was an actress, so may have been helped by the fact that her role is almost entirely sung rather than spoken. Jonathan Pryce is also good as Per&oacute;n, played here less passionate and less determined than his wife, but also a wily political opportunist. Antonio Banderas makes a charismatic Che, although I felt his singing voice was not always up to the role. The film's great strength, of course, is the combination of Rice's lyrics and Andrew Lloyd Webber's music, which combine to produce some of the most memorable songs in the modern musical theatre. Sometimes these are mordantly cynical ("Oh What a Circus", "Goodnight and Thank You", "Peron's Latest Flame"), sometimes lyrical and poignant.( "Another Suitcase in Another Hall", "Don't Cry for Me Argentina"), and sometimes they manage to combine both moods ("I'd Be Surprisingly Good for You"). I should also mention Parker's direction and his ability to find striking visual images to complement the songs. "Evita" triumphantly proved that, even in the nineties, there was still life in the cinematic musical. A goof. We see Magaldi performing at a concert in 1944, which would have been clever of him, given that he died in 1938.

    I had first heard about Evita through a parody: "SCTV" did a parody ad for a musical called "Indira" about Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi (portrayed by Andrea Martin) which had her singing "Don't Cry for Me, Argentina" with Slim Whitman (Joe Flaherty) warbling the male part before segueing to another song. I then saw the actual commercials for "Evita" with, I think, Patti LuPone and Mandy Patinkin doing those songs I previously saw spoofed on that "SCTV" spot. So over 30 years later, I finally watched the film version of the Andrew Lloyd Webber-Tim Rice musical with Madonna essaying the title role. She's quite good singing songs different from her set list especially on the one original song for the movie-"You Must Love Me". Having her veer from caring to shallow and back was also partly natural especially considering the contradictory versions of Evita's life I read about recounted on Wikipedia after seeing the movie. So, yes, she deserves high praise for taking this role and gets much help from both Antonio Banderas as Che and Jonathan Pryce as Eva's eventual husband, Juan Peron. In summary, I highly enjoyed Evita.

    I am a fan of great musicals ... in this effort I've sat thru a lot of bad ones ('Show Boat', 'Carousel', 'The King and I', etc) ... well you have to wade thru the crap to get to the good stuff such as 'My Fair Lady' (imho the best of all-time) and 'Sound of Music', perhaps 'Chicago' and I'd even put 'jesus Christ Superstar' in that realm (tho again, don't think it's going to be a perfectly accurate biblical retelling) ... not sure why people go to musical theatre to see 'history' ... it has little to nothing to do with it ... but of course Evita has been subject to this criteria since it was a record rock opera OK so 'sound of music wasn't historical accurate either ... get over it ... maria was not the Julie Andrews, everyone's idyllic nanny/mother/saint/whore fantasy ... the real maria was a hateful slave-driving bitch of a stage mother who i am eternally surprised wasn't murdered by those kids ... 'so long, farewell, Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye, i must be jabbing this ice pick in your eye' -- far more accurate ... so let's try and put aside the historical and we'll stick to the musical ... which, in not uncertain terms, is a truly great piece of musical theatre ... i never went to see it when originally out on the theatres and frankly had no interest involving anything Madonna was associated with ... but when it made it to cable i happened to leave it on one day was was floored by Antonia Banderas' performance ... much like the the Stage Manager in 'Our Town', has to carry much of the performance by acting like the Greek chorus and adding little bits of info to help us understand some of the finer points ... not to mention give some of the characters a hard time which is pretty delightful all in all ... he is fabulous and really makes the movie move and work Madonna of course has had plenty of accolades for her performance and it is deserved ... she plays it perfectly ... Alan Parker delivers another great adaptation of a musical (Pink Floyd's 'The Wall' being the other) and perhaps he should do more of these ... he seems to have a good touch with them ... but the musical is really the dynamo that keeps the play surging along ... I am not a fan of most Spanish music, I'm a big fan of most music just not Spanish ... but this music is well done and doesn't annoy me at all ... so perhaps it's not so Spanish ... the final scene between Evita and Che as they have their dance during Evita's surgery hallucination is as good as any scene ever in any musical ... the musical is surging and moving and the dance of desire and disgust is perfect as the betrayed everyman represented by Che and the haughty Evita as truly a great climax to the play ... this is well worth several viewings since there are subtleties especially in Banderas' performance that had so much wit and humor that they should not be missed

    Good heavens! This film lasted 135 mins - 120-odd mins too long!(there were a couple of good songs). What possessed someone to think, "Hhmm, let's get the cast to tunelessly 'sing' their lines ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE FILM"?!?!? Don't get me wrong, it was quite visually stunning, a great snapshot of a tumultuous historical turning point and all that, but PLEASE, how did people sit through two hours of that?? Despite the film's saving graces (and there were a few), this still makes it into my worst films of all time list, purely because I found it impossible to sit through from start to finish without wanting to pour red-hot magma into my ears!

    Although musicals were a highly theatrical form during the last quarter of the twentieth century, the traditional cinema musical declined during this period; "Evita" was one of the few stage musicals to transfer to the cinema screen. Most cinematic musicals of the period ("Fame" being a good example and "Grease" a rare exception) generally use spoken dialogue to convey emotion, with the characters only singing and dancing in situations where people would sing and dance in real life. "Evita", however, goes to the opposite extreme. It is more like an opera than to a traditional musical, with little spoken dialogue, almost everything being sung. &nbsp; Eva Per&oacute;n was, and remains, a controversial figure, both in her native Argentina and internationally, but there can be little doubt that she was also a remarkable one. (I cannot imagine any other female political leader from Latin America who could have inspired a hit musical). "Evita" has always had a special interest for me, both as a stage production and as a film, because I used to have an Argentine girlfriend, and our first date was to see the stage version; she was able to explain a lot of the political background to me. Eva's husband Juan Per&oacute;n is often thought of, at least in Europe and North America, as a "fascist", but (as my girlfriend was quick to point out) there was a big difference between him and other Latin American leaders referred to by this term. The likes of Pinochet, Stroessner and Galtieri were military strongmen who ruled by force of arms; any support they might have enjoyed among the civilian population came largely from their countries' upper classes. Per&oacute;n, by contrast, was a populist leader with links to the trade unions who enjoyed strong working-class support. Despite his military background he was distrusted by his fellow military leaders and loathed by Argentina's social elite, who saw him as a jumped-up demagogue. Although his regime was undoubtedly an authoritarian one, he was also responsible for instituting many social reforms, and the strength of his legacy can be gauged by the fact that since 1946, Peronist candidates have won eight of the ten Argentine presidential elections that they have not been banned from participating in; the current president, Cristina Kirchner, is a Peronist. Eva played an important role in her husband's rise to power, rallying his supporters when he was arrested by the military dictatorship, and during his time in office she was virtually canonised by the party faithful, who saw her as the "spiritual leader of the nation". The film, like the stage musical, traces her life from her impoverished childhood, through her rise to fame as an actress, her marriage to Per&oacute;n and her time as first lady to her tragic death from cancer at the age of 33. The film essentially tells the same story as the stage show, but makes two major changes. In the stage production, Eva leaves her first lover, the singer Agust&iacute;n Magaldi; in the film he abandons her to return to his wife. The reason, it seems, is to make the young Eva a more sympathetic and vulnerable character, and possibly also to give Madonna the chance to perform one of the show's hit songs, "Another Suitcase in Another Hall", which on stage is sung by Per&oacute;n's mistress. The second major change concerns the character of Che, who here becomes an everyman figure and is not identified with the historical Che Guevara. (It is said that the left-leaning director Alan Parker made this change because he did not like the way Guevara, an idol of the Left, had been treated by the right-leaning lyricist Tim Rice). If anything, the "Che" of the movie is more of a disillusioned Peronist- we see him marching as one of the "descamisados" who sweep Per&oacute;n to power- than a Communist. Madonna has not always struck me as the world's greatest actress, and it was a brave move on Parker's part to cast her here ahead of established actresses like Liza Minnelli and Michelle Pfeiffer. Although she had given decent performances in films like "Desperately Seeking Susan" and "A League of their Own", she had also given some lousy ones, "Body of Evidence" being a notorious example. Parker's gamble paid off; Madonna had campaigned hard for the part, describing it as a "role she was born to play", and was able to make good her boast. She gives here the greatest acting performance of her career, able to bring out all the contrasting sides of Eva's personality, making her not merely a strong and determined woman but also a vulnerable and tragic one. Madonna, of course, was a singer before she was an actress, so may have been helped by the fact that her role is almost entirely sung rather than spoken. Jonathan Pryce is also good as Per&oacute;n, played here less passionate and less determined than his wife, but also a wily political opportunist. Antonio Banderas makes a charismatic Che, although I felt his singing voice was not always up to the role. The film's great strength, of course, is the combination of Rice's lyrics and Andrew Lloyd Webber's music, which combine to produce some of the most memorable songs in the modern musical theatre. Sometimes these are mordantly cynical ("Oh What a Circus", "Goodnight and Thank You", "Peron's Latest Flame"), sometimes lyrical and poignant.( "Another Suitcase in Another Hall", "Don't Cry for Me Argentina"), and sometimes they manage to combine both moods ("I'd Be Surprisingly Good for You"). I should also mention Parker's direction and his ability to find striking visual images to complement the songs. "Evita" triumphantly proved that, even in the nineties, there was still life in the cinematic musical. A goof. We see Magaldi performing at a concert in 1944, which would have been clever of him, given that he died in 1938.

    I had first heard about Evita through a parody: "SCTV" did a parody ad for a musical called "Indira" about Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi (portrayed by Andrea Martin) which had her singing "Don't Cry for Me, Argentina" with Slim Whitman (Joe Flaherty) warbling the male part before segueing to another song. I then saw the actual commercials for "Evita" with, I think, Patti LuPone and Mandy Patinkin doing those songs I previously saw spoofed on that "SCTV" spot. So over 30 years later, I finally watched the film version of the Andrew Lloyd Webber-Tim Rice musical with Madonna essaying the title role. She's quite good singing songs different from her set list especially on the one original song for the movie-"You Must Love Me". Having her veer from caring to shallow and back was also partly natural especially considering the contradictory versions of Evita's life I read about recounted on Wikipedia after seeing the movie. So, yes, she deserves high praise for taking this role and gets much help from both Antonio Banderas as Che and Jonathan Pryce as Eva's eventual husband, Juan Peron. In summary, I highly enjoyed Evita.

    I am a fan of great musicals ... in this effort I've sat thru a lot of bad ones ('Show Boat', 'Carousel', 'The King and I', etc) ... well you have to wade thru the crap to get to the good stuff such as 'My Fair Lady' (imho the best of all-time) and 'Sound of Music', perhaps 'Chicago' and I'd even put 'jesus Christ Superstar' in that realm (tho again, don't think it's going to be a perfectly accurate biblical retelling) ... not sure why people go to musical theatre to see 'history' ... it has little to nothing to do with it ... but of course Evita has been subject to this criteria since it was a record rock opera OK so 'sound of music wasn't historical accurate either ... get over it ... maria was not the Julie Andrews, everyone's idyllic nanny/mother/saint/whore fantasy ... the real maria was a hateful slave-driving bitch of a stage mother who i am eternally surprised wasn't murdered by those kids ... 'so long, farewell, Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye, i must be jabbing this ice pick in your eye' -- far more accurate ... so let's try and put aside the historical and we'll stick to the musical ... which, in not uncertain terms, is a truly great piece of musical theatre ... i never went to see it when originally out on the theatres and frankly had no interest involving anything Madonna was associated with ... but when it made it to cable i happened to leave it on one day was was floored by Antonia Banderas' performance ... much like the the Stage Manager in 'Our Town', has to carry much of the performance by acting like the Greek chorus and adding little bits of info to help us understand some of the finer points ... not to mention give some of the characters a hard time which is pretty delightful all in all ... he is fabulous and really makes the movie move and work Madonna of course has had plenty of accolades for her performance and it is deserved ... she plays it perfectly ... Alan Parker delivers another great adaptation of a musical (Pink Floyd's 'The Wall' being the other) and perhaps he should do more of these ... he seems to have a good touch with them ... but the musical is really the dynamo that keeps the play surging along ... I am not a fan of most Spanish music, I'm a big fan of most music just not Spanish ... but this music is well done and doesn't annoy me at all ... so perhaps it's not so Spanish ... the final scene between Evita and Che as they have their dance during Evita's surgery hallucination is as good as any scene ever in any musical ... the musical is surging and moving and the dance of desire and disgust is perfect as the betrayed everyman represented by Che and the haughty Evita as truly a great climax to the play ... this is well worth several viewings since there are subtleties especially in Banderas' performance that had so much wit and humor that they should not be missed

    I usually try to keep my opinions to myself until I actually review a film on IMDb, but this time I got on my feet and I booed with the rest of the angry mob. I would have thrown fruit if I'd had some. This is the silliest thing to come out of South America since the movie "Medell&iacute;n". It's overacted, it's under-directed and it's paced like a SNAIL. Oh, and did I mention it's long? You know, it's a real disappointment for me because I had Madonna on my list of stars to watch in 1994. And now I think I'm gonna have her on my list of stars to watch fade in 1996.

    I can't tell you how disappointing this film is. The stage version is brilliant and this miscast, misdirected film version is a complete failure. Note; Madonna only received a Golden Globe Award which is SO telling! I'm convinced the GG can be purchased. All kinds of songs were chopped and there was no choreography! Go see the stage version! Madonna's weakness as a singer is clear. She should stick to pop music and video "acting". The wardrobe was done very well but certainly not enough of a reason to see this waste of money. What a shame that every big actress in town wanted this role and this is how it wound up. All of the men were miscast as well. Especially Magaldi.

    Ignore the IMDb average rating, which is increasingly becoming worse at indicating the quality of a film. In the interim between 1978 and 1996, the story had become more timely. Those watching the film in 1997 couldn't have failed to see the parallel between this and Princess Diana's death. Comparing the two gives some idea of how the Argetinians felt towards Eva. Madonna proves to be an ideal choice. I've never been particularly interested in Madonna, but she captures the attention of the audience throughout. She plays her journey from naive girl to politicised woman smoothly and believably, seeming to identify with Eva on some level. Vocally, she does not have a musical theatre voice but then Broadway belting isn't appropriate in a modern movie musicals. Her voice is thin but very pleasant to listen to and appropriately intimate for songs like "Another Suitcase in Another Hall" (which in the stage version is sung by a minor character) and "I'd Be Surprisingly Good For You". Eva's methods of getting to the top- bed-hopping until she finds the right bed- may seem dubious, but it's not inconceivable to think that a beautiful young woman with no social standing would use all that she does have to climb to a position where she won't need to use that. Because Eva does seem genuinely nice, Che (Antonio Banderas) becomes less sympathetic. Che is the working man who appears throughout Eva's life in various guises, casting doubt on whether she is nothing more than an actress. Banderas' voice has character and it works well with the film but it's not a very musical voice. Perhaps it is appropriate that this working class man, the voice of reality, should have a rougher voice. As Juan Peron, Jonathan Pryce's part is relatively small yet he remains convincing. He's no great singer but the acting that comes through in his singing more than compensates. His love for Eva and her love for him is completely believable, almost heartbreaking. Those unfamiliar with South American politics may find themselves confused at points in the film but the story is abstract enough to have power on its own, and perhaps is best treated as that rather than a historical documentary. The film is also completely sung-through, apart from a few lines, so fans of Les Miserables and Phantom of The Opera should definitely watch this. For those who aren't used to that style, if you keep an open mind, you'll find yourself swept along, as happened with The Artist. Unlike some of his other musicals, Andrew Lloyd Webber (with Tim Rice as lyricist) has created songs that are fully integrated into the narrative. Evita is one of his more sophisticated shows and proof that the dichotomy between popular musicals and serious musicals is false. "Don't Cry For Me Argentina" is the most well-known but there are many great ones: "Oh What A Circus", "Good Night and Good Luck", "I'd Be Surprisingly Good For You", etc. Films with this emotional power are rare, so track it down now!

    The film was fairly good, the music great, Antonio Banderas brilliant as always. However, it was a huge mistake to cast Madonna as Eva Peron, even though she did her level best. Elaine Paige would have been a hundred times better as she has a much better voice and is a much better actor. Watched it in the cinema with my family and clearly Madonna was misplaced, out of her depth and just didn't have the acting skills needed in such an otherwise great production. Elaine Paige had already performed the musical on stage many times, and would have been the natural choice, but unfortunately she wasn't allowed to shine in the movie adaptation.

    I never liked musicals much, and this one is definitely not an exception. Too much music and too little (hi)story... In addition, the movie is also ideologically and politically very clearly oriented to the left, which doesn't help. It simply isn't true that the 'Peronistas' where all good guys, and the others all bad... Who knows, absurdly though, if the military had stayed in power longer like in Chile, maybe Argentina wouldn't have gotten into the sort of financial troubles that have ravaged a once rich and prosperous nation and almost destroyed it altogether (and please note that I am no way a militarist at all)! Surprisingly, the only thing I appreciated was Madonna's singing, which was very good. Otherwise the movie was average.

    The life story of "Evita" as portrayed by pop singer Madonna and directed by Alan Parker. For someone knowing very little about the subject, this film is a quite a chore to sit through. It's over two hours long, without much plot, and we begins with the elaborate funeral of its lead character. Since the subject, Eva Duarte, was evidently engaging, and played by another fascinating woman, the film is disappointing. In one scene, she gives away money by throwing it at people. The material girl's jewels and wardrobe must be worth millions... Lost is why so many remember Evita, but forget Michael J. Brody Jr.... The story is told in operatic fashion. Yet, it is not a traditional opera, or musical - it is like a silent film in color, with dubbed songs and a synchronized sound effects track. In lieu of title cards, handsome Antonio Banderas (as Che) sings about the woman he professes to dislike, but we know he really loves. The dubbing works best with Madonna, who is quite convincing in her "sing acting" - especially on the film's best song, "Don't Cry for Me, Argentina" (a great one, composed by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber), but the melding of music and motion picture is otherwise mechanical. The film lacks heart. ***** Evita (12/14/96) Alan Parker ~ Madonna, Antonio Banderas, Jonathan Pryce, Jimmy Nail

    Although musicals were a highly theatrical form during the last quarter of the twentieth century, the traditional cinema musical declined during this period; "Evita" was one of the few stage musicals to transfer to the cinema screen. Most cinematic musicals of the period ("Fame" being a good example and "Grease" a rare exception) generally use spoken dialogue to convey emotion, with the characters only singing and dancing in situations where people would sing and dance in real life. "Evita", however, goes to the opposite extreme. It is more like an opera than to a traditional musical, with little spoken dialogue, almost everything being sung. &nbsp; Eva Per&oacute;n was, and remains, a controversial figure, both in her native Argentina and internationally, but there can be little doubt that she was also a remarkable one. (I cannot imagine any other female political leader from Latin America who could have inspired a hit musical). "Evita" has always had a special interest for me, both as a stage production and as a film, because I used to have an Argentine girlfriend, and our first date was to see the stage version; she was able to explain a lot of the political background to me. Eva's husband Juan Per&oacute;n is often thought of, at least in Europe and North America, as a "fascist", but (as my girlfriend was quick to point out) there was a big difference between him and other Latin American leaders referred to by this term. The likes of Pinochet, Stroessner and Galtieri were military strongmen who ruled by force of arms; any support they might have enjoyed among the civilian population came largely from their countries' upper classes. Per&oacute;n, by contrast, was a populist leader with links to the trade unions who enjoyed strong working-class support. Despite his military background he was distrusted by his fellow military leaders and loathed by Argentina's social elite, who saw him as a jumped-up demagogue. Although his regime was undoubtedly an authoritarian one, he was also responsible for instituting many social reforms, and the strength of his legacy can be gauged by the fact that since 1946, Peronist candidates have won eight of the ten Argentine presidential elections that they have not been banned from participating in; the current president, Cristina Kirchner, is a Peronist. Eva played an important role in her husband's rise to power, rallying his supporters when he was arrested by the military dictatorship, and during his time in office she was virtually canonised by the party faithful, who saw her as the "spiritual leader of the nation". The film, like the stage musical, traces her life from her impoverished childhood, through her rise to fame as an actress, her marriage to Per&oacute;n and her time as first lady to her tragic death from cancer at the age of 33. The film essentially tells the same story as the stage show, but makes two major changes. In the stage production, Eva leaves her first lover, the singer Agust&iacute;n Magaldi; in the film he abandons her to return to his wife. The reason, it seems, is to make the young Eva a more sympathetic and vulnerable character, and possibly also to give Madonna the chance to perform one of the show's hit songs, "Another Suitcase in Another Hall", which on stage is sung by Per&oacute;n's mistress. The second major change concerns the character of Che, who here becomes an everyman figure and is not identified with the historical Che Guevara. (It is said that the left-leaning director Alan Parker made this change because he did not like the way Guevara, an idol of the Left, had been treated by the right-leaning lyricist Tim Rice). If anything, the "Che" of the movie is more of a disillusioned Peronist- we see him marching as one of the "descamisados" who sweep Per&oacute;n to power- than a Communist. Madonna has not always struck me as the world's greatest actress, and it was a brave move on Parker's part to cast her here ahead of established actresses like Liza Minnelli and Michelle Pfeiffer. Although she had given decent performances in films like "Desperately Seeking Susan" and "A League of their Own", she had also given some lousy ones, "Body of Evidence" being a notorious example. Parker's gamble paid off; Madonna had campaigned hard for the part, describing it as a "role she was born to play", and was able to make good her boast. She gives here the greatest acting performance of her career, able to bring out all the contrasting sides of Eva's personality, making her not merely a strong and determined woman but also a vulnerable and tragic one. Madonna, of course, was a singer before she was an actress, so may have been helped by the fact that her role is almost entirely sung rather than spoken. Jonathan Pryce is also good as Per&oacute;n, played here less passionate and less determined than his wife, but also a wily political opportunist. Antonio Banderas makes a charismatic Che, although I felt his singing voice was not always up to the role. The film's great strength, of course, is the combination of Rice's lyrics and Andrew Lloyd Webber's music, which combine to produce some of the most memorable songs in the modern musical theatre. Sometimes these are mordantly cynical ("Oh What a Circus", "Goodnight and Thank You", "Peron's Latest Flame"), sometimes lyrical and poignant.( "Another Suitcase in Another Hall", "Don't Cry for Me Argentina"), and sometimes they manage to combine both moods ("I'd Be Surprisingly Good for You"). I should also mention Parker's direction and his ability to find striking visual images to complement the songs. "Evita" triumphantly proved that, even in the nineties, there was still life in the cinematic musical. A goof. We see Magaldi performing at a concert in 1944, which would have been clever of him, given that he died in 1938.

    I am a fan of great musicals ... in this effort I've sat thru a lot of bad ones ('Show Boat', 'Carousel', 'The King and I', etc) ... well you have to wade thru the crap to get to the good stuff such as 'My Fair Lady' (imho the best of all-time) and 'Sound of Music', perhaps 'Chicago' and I'd even put 'jesus Christ Superstar' in that realm (tho again, don't think it's going to be a perfectly accurate biblical retelling) ... not sure why people go to musical theatre to see 'history' ... it has little to nothing to do with it ... but of course Evita has been subject to this criteria since it was a record rock opera OK so 'sound of music wasn't historical accurate either ... get over it ... maria was not the Julie Andrews, everyone's idyllic nanny/mother/saint/whore fantasy ... the real maria was a hateful slave-driving bitch of a stage mother who i am eternally surprised wasn't murdered by those kids ... 'so long, farewell, Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye, i must be jabbing this ice pick in your eye' -- far more accurate ... so let's try and put aside the historical and we'll stick to the musical ... which, in not uncertain terms, is a truly great piece of musical theatre ... i never went to see it when originally out on the theatres and frankly had no interest involving anything Madonna was associated with ... but when it made it to cable i happened to leave it on one day was was floored by Antonia Banderas' performance ... much like the the Stage Manager in 'Our Town', has to carry much of the performance by acting like the Greek chorus and adding little bits of info to help us understand some of the finer points ... not to mention give some of the characters a hard time which is pretty delightful all in all ... he is fabulous and really makes the movie move and work Madonna of course has had plenty of accolades for her performance and it is deserved ... she plays it perfectly ... Alan Parker delivers another great adaptation of a musical (Pink Floyd's 'The Wall' being the other) and perhaps he should do more of these ... he seems to have a good touch with them ... but the musical is really the dynamo that keeps the play surging along ... I am not a fan of most Spanish music, I'm a big fan of most music just not Spanish ... but this music is well done and doesn't annoy me at all ... so perhaps it's not so Spanish ... the final scene between Evita and Che as they have their dance during Evita's surgery hallucination is as good as any scene ever in any musical ... the musical is surging and moving and the dance of desire and disgust is perfect as the betrayed everyman represented by Che and the haughty Evita as truly a great climax to the play ... this is well worth several viewings since there are subtleties especially in Banderas' performance that had so much wit and humor that they should not be missed

    I can't tell you how disappointing this film is. The stage version is brilliant and this miscast, misdirected film version is a complete failure. Note; Madonna only received a Golden Globe Award which is SO telling! I'm convinced the GG can be purchased. All kinds of songs were chopped and there was no choreography! Go see the stage version! Madonna's weakness as a singer is clear. She should stick to pop music and video "acting". The wardrobe was done very well but certainly not enough of a reason to see this waste of money. What a shame that every big actress in town wanted this role and this is how it wound up. All of the men were miscast as well. Especially Magaldi.

    Ignore the IMDb average rating, which is increasingly becoming worse at indicating the quality of a film. In the interim between 1978 and 1996, the story had become more timely. Those watching the film in 1997 couldn't have failed to see the parallel between this and Princess Diana's death. Comparing the two gives some idea of how the Argetinians felt towards Eva. Madonna proves to be an ideal choice. I've never been particularly interested in Madonna, but she captures the attention of the audience throughout. She plays her journey from naive girl to politicised woman smoothly and believably, seeming to identify with Eva on some level. Vocally, she does not have a musical theatre voice but then Broadway belting isn't appropriate in a modern movie musicals. Her voice is thin but very pleasant to listen to and appropriately intimate for songs like "Another Suitcase in Another Hall" (which in the stage version is sung by a minor character) and "I'd Be Surprisingly Good For You". Eva's methods of getting to the top- bed-hopping until she finds the right bed- may seem dubious, but it's not inconceivable to think that a beautiful young woman with no social standing would use all that she does have to climb to a position where she won't need to use that. Because Eva does seem genuinely nice, Che (Antonio Banderas) becomes less sympathetic. Che is the working man who appears throughout Eva's life in various guises, casting doubt on whether she is nothing more than an actress. Banderas' voice has character and it works well with the film but it's not a very musical voice. Perhaps it is appropriate that this working class man, the voice of reality, should have a rougher voice. As Juan Peron, Jonathan Pryce's part is relatively small yet he remains convincing. He's no great singer but the acting that comes through in his singing more than compensates. His love for Eva and her love for him is completely believable, almost heartbreaking. Those unfamiliar with South American politics may find themselves confused at points in the film but the story is abstract enough to have power on its own, and perhaps is best treated as that rather than a historical documentary. The film is also completely sung-through, apart from a few lines, so fans of Les Miserables and Phantom of The Opera should definitely watch this. For those who aren't used to that style, if you keep an open mind, you'll find yourself swept along, as happened with The Artist. Unlike some of his other musicals, Andrew Lloyd Webber (with Tim Rice as lyricist) has created songs that are fully integrated into the narrative. Evita is one of his more sophisticated shows and proof that the dichotomy between popular musicals and serious musicals is false. "Don't Cry For Me Argentina" is the most well-known but there are many great ones: "Oh What A Circus", "Good Night and Good Luck", "I'd Be Surprisingly Good For You", etc. Films with this emotional power are rare, so track it down now!

    The film was fairly good, the music great, Antonio Banderas brilliant as always. However, it was a huge mistake to cast Madonna as Eva Peron, even though she did her level best. Elaine Paige would have been a hundred times better as she has a much better voice and is a much better actor. Watched it in the cinema with my family and clearly Madonna was misplaced, out of her depth and just didn't have the acting skills needed in such an otherwise great production. Elaine Paige had already performed the musical on stage many times, and would have been the natural choice, but unfortunately she wasn't allowed to shine in the movie adaptation.

    I never liked musicals much, and this one is definitely not an exception. Too much music and too little (hi)story... In addition, the movie is also ideologically and politically very clearly oriented to the left, which doesn't help. It simply isn't true that the 'Peronistas' where all good guys, and the others all bad... Who knows, absurdly though, if the military had stayed in power longer like in Chile, maybe Argentina wouldn't have gotten into the sort of financial troubles that have ravaged a once rich and prosperous nation and almost destroyed it altogether (and please note that I am no way a militarist at all)! Surprisingly, the only thing I appreciated was Madonna's singing, which was very good. Otherwise the movie was average.

    The life story of "Evita" as portrayed by pop singer Madonna and directed by Alan Parker. For someone knowing very little about the subject, this film is a quite a chore to sit through. It's over two hours long, without much plot, and we begins with the elaborate funeral of its lead character. Since the subject, Eva Duarte, was evidently engaging, and played by another fascinating woman, the film is disappointing. In one scene, she gives away money by throwing it at people. The material girl's jewels and wardrobe must be worth millions... Lost is why so many remember Evita, but forget Michael J. Brody Jr.... The story is told in operatic fashion. Yet, it is not a traditional opera, or musical - it is like a silent film in color, with dubbed songs and a synchronized sound effects track. In lieu of title cards, handsome Antonio Banderas (as Che) sings about the woman he professes to dislike, but we know he really loves. The dubbing works best with Madonna, who is quite convincing in her "sing acting" - especially on the film's best song, "Don't Cry for Me, Argentina" (a great one, composed by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber), but the melding of music and motion picture is otherwise mechanical. The film lacks heart. ***** Evita (12/14/96) Alan Parker ~ Madonna, Antonio Banderas, Jonathan Pryce, Jimmy Nail

    Good heavens! This film lasted 135 mins - 120-odd mins too long!(there were a couple of good songs). What possessed someone to think, "Hhmm, let's get the cast to tunelessly 'sing' their lines ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE FILM"?!?!? Don't get me wrong, it was quite visually stunning, a great snapshot of a tumultuous historical turning point and all that, but PLEASE, how did people sit through two hours of that?? Despite the film's saving graces (and there were a few), this still makes it into my worst films of all time list, purely because I found it impossible to sit through from start to finish without wanting to pour red-hot magma into my ears!

    Although musicals were a highly theatrical form during the last quarter of the twentieth century, the traditional cinema musical declined during this period; "Evita" was one of the few stage musicals to transfer to the cinema screen. Most cinematic musicals of the period ("Fame" being a good example and "Grease" a rare exception) generally use spoken dialogue to convey emotion, with the characters only singing and dancing in situations where people would sing and dance in real life. "Evita", however, goes to the opposite extreme. It is more like an opera than to a traditional musical, with little spoken dialogue, almost everything being sung. &nbsp; Eva Per&oacute;n was, and remains, a controversial figure, both in her native Argentina and internationally, but there can be little doubt that she was also a remarkable one. (I cannot imagine any other female political leader from Latin America who could have inspired a hit musical). "Evita" has always had a special interest for me, both as a stage production and as a film, because I used to have an Argentine girlfriend, and our first date was to see the stage version; she was able to explain a lot of the political background to me. Eva's husband Juan Per&oacute;n is often thought of, at least in Europe and North America, as a "fascist", but (as my girlfriend was quick to point out) there was a big difference between him and other Latin American leaders referred to by this term. The likes of Pinochet, Stroessner and Galtieri were military strongmen who ruled by force of arms; any support they might have enjoyed among the civilian population came largely from their countries' upper classes. Per&oacute;n, by contrast, was a populist leader with links to the trade unions who enjoyed strong working-class support. Despite his military background he was distrusted by his fellow military leaders and loathed by Argentina's social elite, who saw him as a jumped-up demagogue. Although his regime was undoubtedly an authoritarian one, he was also responsible for instituting many social reforms, and the strength of his legacy can be gauged by the fact that since 1946, Peronist candidates have won eight of the ten Argentine presidential elections that they have not been banned from participating in; the current president, Cristina Kirchner, is a Peronist. Eva played an important role in her husband's rise to power, rallying his supporters when he was arrested by the military dictatorship, and during his time in office she was virtually canonised by the party faithful, who saw her as the "spiritual leader of the nation". The film, like the stage musical, traces her life from her impoverished childhood, through her rise to fame as an actress, her marriage to Per&oacute;n and her time as first lady to her tragic death from cancer at the age of 33. The film essentially tells the same story as the stage show, but makes two major changes. In the stage production, Eva leaves her first lover, the singer Agust&iacute;n Magaldi; in the film he abandons her to return to his wife. The reason, it seems, is to make the young Eva a more sympathetic and vulnerable character, and possibly also to give Madonna the chance to perform one of the show's hit songs, "Another Suitcase in Another Hall", which on stage is sung by Per&oacute;n's mistress. The second major change concerns the character of Che, who here becomes an everyman figure and is not identified with the historical Che Guevara. (It is said that the left-leaning director Alan Parker made this change because he did not like the way Guevara, an idol of the Left, had been treated by the right-leaning lyricist Tim Rice). If anything, the "Che" of the movie is more of a disillusioned Peronist- we see him marching as one of the "descamisados" who sweep Per&oacute;n to power- than a Communist. Madonna has not always struck me as the world's greatest actress, and it was a brave move on Parker's part to cast her here ahead of established actresses like Liza Minnelli and Michelle Pfeiffer. Although she had given decent performances in films like "Desperately Seeking Susan" and "A League of their Own", she had also given some lousy ones, "Body of Evidence" being a notorious example. Parker's gamble paid off; Madonna had campaigned hard for the part, describing it as a "role she was born to play", and was able to make good her boast. She gives here the greatest acting performance of her career, able to bring out all the contrasting sides of Eva's personality, making her not merely a strong and determined woman but also a vulnerable and tragic one. Madonna, of course, was a singer before she was an actress, so may have been helped by the fact that her role is almost entirely sung rather than spoken. Jonathan Pryce is also good as Per&oacute;n, played here less passionate and less determined than his wife, but also a wily political opportunist. Antonio Banderas makes a charismatic Che, although I felt his singing voice was not always up to the role. The film's great strength, of course, is the combination of Rice's lyrics and Andrew Lloyd Webber's music, which combine to produce some of the most memorable songs in the modern musical theatre. Sometimes these are mordantly cynical ("Oh What a Circus", "Goodnight and Thank You", "Peron's Latest Flame"), sometimes lyrical and poignant.( "Another Suitcase in Another Hall", "Don't Cry for Me Argentina"), and sometimes they manage to combine both moods ("I'd Be Surprisingly Good for You"). I should also mention Parker's direction and his ability to find striking visual images to complement the songs. "Evita" triumphantly proved that, even in the nineties, there was still life in the cinematic musical. A goof. We see Magaldi performing at a concert in 1944, which would have been clever of him, given that he died in 1938.

    I had first heard about Evita through a parody: "SCTV" did a parody ad for a musical called "Indira" about Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi (portrayed by Andrea Martin) which had her singing "Don't Cry for Me, Argentina" with Slim Whitman (Joe Flaherty) warbling the male part before segueing to another song. I then saw the actual commercials for "Evita" with, I think, Patti LuPone and Mandy Patinkin doing those songs I previously saw spoofed on that "SCTV" spot. So over 30 years later, I finally watched the film version of the Andrew Lloyd Webber-Tim Rice musical with Madonna essaying the title role. She's quite good singing songs different from her set list especially on the one original song for the movie-"You Must Love Me". Having her veer from caring to shallow and back was also partly natural especially considering the contradictory versions of Evita's life I read about recounted on Wikipedia after seeing the movie. So, yes, she deserves high praise for taking this role and gets much help from both Antonio Banderas as Che and Jonathan Pryce as Eva's eventual husband, Juan Peron. In summary, I highly enjoyed Evita.

    I am a fan of great musicals ... in this effort I've sat thru a lot of bad ones ('Show Boat', 'Carousel', 'The King and I', etc) ... well you have to wade thru the crap to get to the good stuff such as 'My Fair Lady' (imho the best of all-time) and 'Sound of Music', perhaps 'Chicago' and I'd even put 'jesus Christ Superstar' in that realm (tho again, don't think it's going to be a perfectly accurate biblical retelling) ... not sure why people go to musical theatre to see 'history' ... it has little to nothing to do with it ... but of course Evita has been subject to this criteria since it was a record rock opera OK so 'sound of music wasn't historical accurate either ... get over it ... maria was not the Julie Andrews, everyone's idyllic nanny/mother/saint/whore fantasy ... the real maria was a hateful slave-driving bitch of a stage mother who i am eternally surprised wasn't murdered by those kids ... 'so long, farewell, Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye, i must be jabbing this ice pick in your eye' -- far more accurate ... so let's try and put aside the historical and we'll stick to the musical ... which, in not uncertain terms, is a truly great piece of musical theatre ... i never went to see it when originally out on the theatres and frankly had no interest involving anything Madonna was associated with ... but when it made it to cable i happened to leave it on one day was was floored by Antonia Banderas' performance ... much like the the Stage Manager in 'Our Town', has to carry much of the performance by acting like the Greek chorus and adding little bits of info to help us understand some of the finer points ... not to mention give some of the characters a hard time which is pretty delightful all in all ... he is fabulous and really makes the movie move and work Madonna of course has had plenty of accolades for her performance and it is deserved ... she plays it perfectly ... Alan Parker delivers another great adaptation of a musical (Pink Floyd's 'The Wall' being the other) and perhaps he should do more of these ... he seems to have a good touch with them ... but the musical is really the dynamo that keeps the play surging along ... I am not a fan of most Spanish music, I'm a big fan of most music just not Spanish ... but this music is well done and doesn't annoy me at all ... so perhaps it's not so Spanish ... the final scene between Evita and Che as they have their dance during Evita's surgery hallucination is as good as any scene ever in any musical ... the musical is surging and moving and the dance of desire and disgust is perfect as the betrayed everyman represented by Che and the haughty Evita as truly a great climax to the play ... this is well worth several viewings since there are subtleties especially in Banderas' performance that had so much wit and humor that they should not be missed

    I usually try to keep my opinions to myself until I actually review a film on IMDb, but this time I got on my feet and I booed with the rest of the angry mob. I would have thrown fruit if I'd had some. This is the silliest thing to come out of South America since the movie "Medell&iacute;n". It's overacted, it's under-directed and it's paced like a SNAIL. Oh, and did I mention it's long? You know, it's a real disappointment for me because I had Madonna on my list of stars to watch in 1994. And now I think I'm gonna have her on my list of stars to watch fade in 1996.

    Although musicals were a highly theatrical form during the last quarter of the twentieth century, the traditional cinema musical declined during this period; "Evita" was one of the few stage musicals to transfer to the cinema screen. Most cinematic musicals of the period ("Fame" being a good example and "Grease" a rare exception) generally use spoken dialogue to convey emotion, with the characters only singing and dancing in situations where people would sing and dance in real life. "Evita", however, goes to the opposite extreme. It is more like an opera than to a traditional musical, with little spoken dialogue, almost everything being sung. &nbsp; Eva Per&oacute;n was, and remains, a controversial figure, both in her native Argentina and internationally, but there can be little doubt that she was also a remarkable one. (I cannot imagine any other female political leader from Latin America who could have inspired a hit musical). "Evita" has always had a special interest for me, both as a stage production and as a film, because I used to have an Argentine girlfriend, and our first date was to see the stage version; she was able to explain a lot of the political background to me. Eva's husband Juan Per&oacute;n is often thought of, at least in Europe and North America, as a "fascist", but (as my girlfriend was quick to point out) there was a big difference between him and other Latin American leaders referred to by this term. The likes of Pinochet, Stroessner and Galtieri were military strongmen who ruled by force of arms; any support they might have enjoyed among the civilian population came largely from their countries' upper classes. Per&oacute;n, by contrast, was a populist leader with links to the trade unions who enjoyed strong working-class support. Despite his military background he was distrusted by his fellow military leaders and loathed by Argentina's social elite, who saw him as a jumped-up demagogue. Although his regime was undoubtedly an authoritarian one, he was also responsible for instituting many social reforms, and the strength of his legacy can be gauged by the fact that since 1946, Peronist candidates have won eight of the ten Argentine presidential elections that they have not been banned from participating in; the current president, Cristina Kirchner, is a Peronist. Eva played an important role in her husband's rise to power, rallying his supporters when he was arrested by the military dictatorship, and during his time in office she was virtually canonised by the party faithful, who saw her as the "spiritual leader of the nation". The film, like the stage musical, traces her life from her impoverished childhood, through her rise to fame as an actress, her marriage to Per&oacute;n and her time as first lady to her tragic death from cancer at the age of 33. The film essentially tells the same story as the stage show, but makes two major changes. In the stage production, Eva leaves her first lover, the singer Agust&iacute;n Magaldi; in the film he abandons her to return to his wife. The reason, it seems, is to make the young Eva a more sympathetic and vulnerable character, and possibly also to give Madonna the chance to perform one of the show's hit songs, "Another Suitcase in Another Hall", which on stage is sung by Per&oacute;n's mistress. The second major change concerns the character of Che, who here becomes an everyman figure and is not identified with the historical Che Guevara. (It is said that the left-leaning director Alan Parker made this change because he did not like the way Guevara, an idol of the Left, had been treated by the right-leaning lyricist Tim Rice). If anything, the "Che" of the movie is more of a disillusioned Peronist- we see him marching as one of the "descamisados" who sweep Per&oacute;n to power- than a Communist. Madonna has not always struck me as the world's greatest actress, and it was a brave move on Parker's part to cast her here ahead of established actresses like Liza Minnelli and Michelle Pfeiffer. Although she had given decent performances in films like "Desperately Seeking Susan" and "A League of their Own", she had also given some lousy ones, "Body of Evidence" being a notorious example. Parker's gamble paid off; Madonna had campaigned hard for the part, describing it as a "role she was born to play", and was able to make good her boast. She gives here the greatest acting performance of her career, able to bring out all the contrasting sides of Eva's personality, making her not merely a strong and determined woman but also a vulnerable and tragic one. Madonna, of course, was a singer before she was an actress, so may have been helped by the fact that her role is almost entirely sung rather than spoken. Jonathan Pryce is also good as Per&oacute;n, played here less passionate and less determined than his wife, but also a wily political opportunist. Antonio Banderas makes a charismatic Che, although I felt his singing voice was not always up to the role. The film's great strength, of course, is the combination of Rice's lyrics and Andrew Lloyd Webber's music, which combine to produce some of the most memorable songs in the modern musical theatre. Sometimes these are mordantly cynical ("Oh What a Circus", "Goodnight and Thank You", "Peron's Latest Flame"), sometimes lyrical and poignant.( "Another Suitcase in Another Hall", "Don't Cry for Me Argentina"), and sometimes they manage to combine both moods ("I'd Be Surprisingly Good for You"). I should also mention Parker's direction and his ability to find striking visual images to complement the songs. "Evita" triumphantly proved that, even in the nineties, there was still life in the cinematic musical. A goof. We see Magaldi performing at a concert in 1944, which would have been clever of him, given that he died in 1938.

    I had first heard about Evita through a parody: "SCTV" did a parody ad for a musical called "Indira" about Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi (portrayed by Andrea Martin) which had her singing "Don't Cry for Me, Argentina" with Slim Whitman (Joe Flaherty) warbling the male part before segueing to another song. I then saw the actual commercials for "Evita" with, I think, Patti LuPone and Mandy Patinkin doing those songs I previously saw spoofed on that "SCTV" spot. So over 30 years later, I finally watched the film version of the Andrew Lloyd Webber-Tim Rice musical with Madonna essaying the title role. She's quite good singing songs different from her set list especially on the one original song for the movie-"You Must Love Me". Having her veer from caring to shallow and back was also partly natural especially considering the contradictory versions of Evita's life I read about recounted on Wikipedia after seeing the movie. So, yes, she deserves high praise for taking this role and gets much help from both Antonio Banderas as Che and Jonathan Pryce as Eva's eventual husband, Juan Peron. In summary, I highly enjoyed Evita.

    I am a fan of great musicals ... in this effort I've sat thru a lot of bad ones ('Show Boat', 'Carousel', 'The King and I', etc) ... well you have to wade thru the crap to get to the good stuff such as 'My Fair Lady' (imho the best of all-time) and 'Sound of Music', perhaps 'Chicago' and I'd even put 'jesus Christ Superstar' in that realm (tho again, don't think it's going to be a perfectly accurate biblical retelling) ... not sure why people go to musical theatre to see 'history' ... it has little to nothing to do with it ... but of course Evita has been subject to this criteria since it was a record rock opera OK so 'sound of music wasn't historical accurate either ... get over it ... maria was not the Julie Andrews, everyone's idyllic nanny/mother/saint/whore fantasy ... the real maria was a hateful slave-driving bitch of a stage mother who i am eternally surprised wasn't murdered by those kids ... 'so long, farewell, Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye, i must be jabbing this ice pick in your eye' -- far more accurate ... so let's try and put aside the historical and we'll stick to the musical ... which, in not uncertain terms, is a truly great piece of musical theatre ... i never went to see it when originally out on the theatres and frankly had no interest involving anything Madonna was associated with ... but when it made it to cable i happened to leave it on one day was was floored by Antonia Banderas' performance ... much like the the Stage Manager in 'Our Town', has to carry much of the performance by acting like the Greek chorus and adding little bits of info to help us understand some of the finer points ... not to mention give some of the characters a hard time which is pretty delightful all in all ... he is fabulous and really makes the movie move and work Madonna of course has had plenty of accolades for her performance and it is deserved ... she plays it perfectly ... Alan Parker delivers another great adaptation of a musical (Pink Floyd's 'The Wall' being the other) and perhaps he should do more of these ... he seems to have a good touch with them ... but the musical is really the dynamo that keeps the play surging along ... I am not a fan of most Spanish music, I'm a big fan of most music just not Spanish ... but this music is well done and doesn't annoy me at all ... so perhaps it's not so Spanish ... the final scene between Evita and Che as they have their dance during Evita's surgery hallucination is as good as any scene ever in any musical ... the musical is surging and moving and the dance of desire and disgust is perfect as the betrayed everyman represented by Che and the haughty Evita as truly a great climax to the play ... this is well worth several viewings since there are subtleties especially in Banderas' performance that had so much wit and humor that they should not be missed

    I usually try to keep my opinions to myself until I actually review a film on IMDb, but this time I got on my feet and I booed with the rest of the angry mob. I would have thrown fruit if I'd had some. This is the silliest thing to come out of South America since the movie "Medell&iacute;n". It's overacted, it's under-directed and it's paced like a SNAIL. Oh, and did I mention it's long? You know, it's a real disappointment for me because I had Madonna on my list of stars to watch in 1994. And now I think I'm gonna have her on my list of stars to watch fade in 1996.

    I can't tell you how disappointing this film is. The stage version is brilliant and this miscast, misdirected film version is a complete failure. Note; Madonna only received a Golden Globe Award which is SO telling! I'm convinced the GG can be purchased. All kinds of songs were chopped and there was no choreography! Go see the stage version! Madonna's weakness as a singer is clear. She should stick to pop music and video "acting". The wardrobe was done very well but certainly not enough of a reason to see this waste of money. What a shame that every big actress in town wanted this role and this is how it wound up. All of the men were miscast as well. Especially Magaldi.

    Ignore the IMDb average rating, which is increasingly becoming worse at indicating the quality of a film. In the interim between 1978 and 1996, the story had become more timely. Those watching the film in 1997 couldn't have failed to see the parallel between this and Princess Diana's death. Comparing the two gives some idea of how the Argetinians felt towards Eva. Madonna proves to be an ideal choice. I've never been particularly interested in Madonna, but she captures the attention of the audience throughout. She plays her journey from naive girl to politicised woman smoothly and believably, seeming to identify with Eva on some level. Vocally, she does not have a musical theatre voice but then Broadway belting isn't appropriate in a modern movie musicals. Her voice is thin but very pleasant to listen to and appropriately intimate for songs like "Another Suitcase in Another Hall" (which in the stage version is sung by a minor character) and "I'd Be Surprisingly Good For You". Eva's methods of getting to the top- bed-hopping until she finds the right bed- may seem dubious, but it's not inconceivable to think that a beautiful young woman with no social standing would use all that she does have to climb to a position where she won't need to use that. Because Eva does seem genuinely nice, Che (Antonio Banderas) becomes less sympathetic. Che is the working man who appears throughout Eva's life in various guises, casting doubt on whether she is nothing more than an actress. Banderas' voice has character and it works well with the film but it's not a very musical voice. Perhaps it is appropriate that this working class man, the voice of reality, should have a rougher voice. As Juan Peron, Jonathan Pryce's part is relatively small yet he remains convincing. He's no great singer but the acting that comes through in his singing more than compensates. His love for Eva and her love for him is completely believable, almost heartbreaking. Those unfamiliar with South American politics may find themselves confused at points in the film but the story is abstract enough to have power on its own, and perhaps is best treated as that rather than a historical documentary. The film is also completely sung-through, apart from a few lines, so fans of Les Miserables and Phantom of The Opera should definitely watch this. For those who aren't used to that style, if you keep an open mind, you'll find yourself swept along, as happened with The Artist. Unlike some of his other musicals, Andrew Lloyd Webber (with Tim Rice as lyricist) has created songs that are fully integrated into the narrative. Evita is one of his more sophisticated shows and proof that the dichotomy between popular musicals and serious musicals is false. "Don't Cry For Me Argentina" is the most well-known but there are many great ones: "Oh What A Circus", "Good Night and Good Luck", "I'd Be Surprisingly Good For You", etc. Films with this emotional power are rare, so track it down now!

    The film was fairly good, the music great, Antonio Banderas brilliant as always. However, it was a huge mistake to cast Madonna as Eva Peron, even though she did her level best. Elaine Paige would have been a hundred times better as she has a much better voice and is a much better actor. Watched it in the cinema with my family and clearly Madonna was misplaced, out of her depth and just didn't have the acting skills needed in such an otherwise great production. Elaine Paige had already performed the musical on stage many times, and would have been the natural choice, but unfortunately she wasn't allowed to shine in the movie adaptation.

    I never liked musicals much, and this one is definitely not an exception. Too much music and too little (hi)story... In addition, the movie is also ideologically and politically very clearly oriented to the left, which doesn't help. It simply isn't true that the 'Peronistas' where all good guys, and the others all bad... Who knows, absurdly though, if the military had stayed in power longer like in Chile, maybe Argentina wouldn't have gotten into the sort of financial troubles that have ravaged a once rich and prosperous nation and almost destroyed it altogether (and please note that I am no way a militarist at all)! Surprisingly, the only thing I appreciated was Madonna's singing, which was very good. Otherwise the movie was average.

    The life story of "Evita" as portrayed by pop singer Madonna and directed by Alan Parker. For someone knowing very little about the subject, this film is a quite a chore to sit through. It's over two hours long, without much plot, and we begins with the elaborate funeral of its lead character. Since the subject, Eva Duarte, was evidently engaging, and played by another fascinating woman, the film is disappointing. In one scene, she gives away money by throwing it at people. The material girl's jewels and wardrobe must be worth millions... Lost is why so many remember Evita, but forget Michael J. Brody Jr.... The story is told in operatic fashion. Yet, it is not a traditional opera, or musical - it is like a silent film in color, with dubbed songs and a synchronized sound effects track. In lieu of title cards, handsome Antonio Banderas (as Che) sings about the woman he professes to dislike, but we know he really loves. The dubbing works best with Madonna, who is quite convincing in her "sing acting" - especially on the film's best song, "Don't Cry for Me, Argentina" (a great one, composed by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber), but the melding of music and motion picture is otherwise mechanical. The film lacks heart. ***** Evita (12/14/96) Alan Parker ~ Madonna, Antonio Banderas, Jonathan Pryce, Jimmy Nail

    Good heavens! This film lasted 135 mins - 120-odd mins too long!(there were a couple of good songs). What possessed someone to think, "Hhmm, let's get the cast to tunelessly 'sing' their lines ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE FILM"?!?!? Don't get me wrong, it was quite visually stunning, a great snapshot of a tumultuous historical turning point and all that, but PLEASE, how did people sit through two hours of that?? Despite the film's saving graces (and there were a few), this still makes it into my worst films of all time list, purely because I found it impossible to sit through from start to finish without wanting to pour red-hot magma into my ears!

    Although musicals were a highly theatrical form during the last quarter of the twentieth century, the traditional cinema musical declined during this period; "Evita" was one of the few stage musicals to transfer to the cinema screen. Most cinematic musicals of the period ("Fame" being a good example and "Grease" a rare exception) generally use spoken dialogue to convey emotion, with the characters only singing and dancing in situations where people would sing and dance in real life. "Evita", however, goes to the opposite extreme. It is more like an opera than to a traditional musical, with little spoken dialogue, almost everything being sung. &nbsp; Eva Per&oacute;n was, and remains, a controversial figure, both in her native Argentina and internationally, but there can be little doubt that she was also a remarkable one. (I cannot imagine any other female political leader from Latin America who could have inspired a hit musical). "Evita" has always had a special interest for me, both as a stage production and as a film, because I used to have an Argentine girlfriend, and our first date was to see the stage version; she was able to explain a lot of the political background to me. Eva's husband Juan Per&oacute;n is often thought of, at least in Europe and North America, as a "fascist", but (as my girlfriend was quick to point out) there was a big difference between him and other Latin American leaders referred to by this term. The likes of Pinochet, Stroessner and Galtieri were military strongmen who ruled by force of arms; any support they might have enjoyed among the civilian population came largely from their countries' upper classes. Per&oacute;n, by contrast, was a populist leader with links to the trade unions who enjoyed strong working-class support. Despite his military background he was distrusted by his fellow military leaders and loathed by Argentina's social elite, who saw him as a jumped-up demagogue. Although his regime was undoubtedly an authoritarian one, he was also responsible for instituting many social reforms, and the strength of his legacy can be gauged by the fact that since 1946, Peronist candidates have won eight of the ten Argentine presidential elections that they have not been banned from participating in; the current president, Cristina Kirchner, is a Peronist. Eva played an important role in her husband's rise to power, rallying his supporters when he was arrested by the military dictatorship, and during his time in office she was virtually canonised by the party faithful, who saw her as the "spiritual leader of the nation". The film, like the stage musical, traces her life from her impoverished childhood, through her rise to fame as an actress, her marriage to Per&oacute;n and her time as first lady to her tragic death from cancer at the age of 33. The film essentially tells the same story as the stage show, but makes two major changes. In the stage production, Eva leaves her first lover, the singer Agust&iacute;n Magaldi; in the film he abandons her to return to his wife. The reason, it seems, is to make the young Eva a more sympathetic and vulnerable character, and possibly also to give Madonna the chance to perform one of the show's hit songs, "Another Suitcase in Another Hall", which on stage is sung by Per&oacute;n's mistress. The second major change concerns the character of Che, who here becomes an everyman figure and is not identified with the historical Che Guevara. (It is said that the left-leaning director Alan Parker made this change because he did not like the way Guevara, an idol of the Left, had been treated by the right-leaning lyricist Tim Rice). If anything, the "Che" of the movie is more of a disillusioned Peronist- we see him marching as one of the "descamisados" who sweep Per&oacute;n to power- than a Communist. Madonna has not always struck me as the world's greatest actress, and it was a brave move on Parker's part to cast her here ahead of established actresses like Liza Minnelli and Michelle Pfeiffer. Although she had given decent performances in films like "Desperately Seeking Susan" and "A League of their Own", she had also given some lousy ones, "Body of Evidence" being a notorious example. Parker's gamble paid off; Madonna had campaigned hard for the part, describing it as a "role she was born to play", and was able to make good her boast. She gives here the greatest acting performance of her career, able to bring out all the contrasting sides of Eva's personality, making her not merely a strong and determined woman but also a vulnerable and tragic one. Madonna, of course, was a singer before she was an actress, so may have been helped by the fact that her role is almost entirely sung rather than spoken. Jonathan Pryce is also good as Per&oacute;n, played here less passionate and less determined than his wife, but also a wily political opportunist. Antonio Banderas makes a charismatic Che, although I felt his singing voice was not always up to the role. The film's great strength, of course, is the combination of Rice's lyrics and Andrew Lloyd Webber's music, which combine to produce some of the most memorable songs in the modern musical theatre. Sometimes these are mordantly cynical ("Oh What a Circus", "Goodnight and Thank You", "Peron's Latest Flame"), sometimes lyrical and poignant.( "Another Suitcase in Another Hall", "Don't Cry for Me Argentina"), and sometimes they manage to combine both moods ("I'd Be Surprisingly Good for You"). I should also mention Parker's direction and his ability to find striking visual images to complement the songs. "Evita" triumphantly proved that, even in the nineties, there was still life in the cinematic musical. A goof. We see Magaldi performing at a concert in 1944, which would have been clever of him, given that he died in 1938.

In summary, I highly enjoyed Evita.

'so long, farewell, Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye, i must be jabbing this ice pick in your eye' -- far more accurate ... so let's try and put aside the historical and we'll stick to the musical ... which, in not uncertain terms, is a truly great piece of musical theatre ... i never went to see it when originally out on the theatres and frankly had no interest involving anything Madonna was associated with ... but when it made it to cable i happened to leave it on one day was was floored by Antonia Banderas' performance ... much like the the Stage Manager in 'Our Town', has to carry much of the performance by acting like the Greek chorus and adding little bits of info to help us understand some of the finer points ... not to mention give some of the characters a hard time which is pretty delightful all in all ... he is fabulous and really makes the movie move and work Madonna of course has had plenty of accolades for her performance and it is deserved ... she plays it perfectly ...

I am not a fan of most Spanish music, I'm a big fan of most music just not Spanish ... but this music is well done and doesn't annoy me at all ... so perhaps it's not so Spanish ... the final scene between Evita and Che as they have their dance during Evita's surgery hallucination is as good as any scene ever in any musical ... the musical is surging and moving and the dance of desire and disgust is perfect as the betrayed everyman represented by Che and the haughty Evita as truly a great climax to the play ... this is well worth several viewings since there are subtleties especially in Banderas' performance that had so much wit and humor that they should not be missed

    The film was fairly good, the music great, Antonio Banderas brilliant as always. However, it was a huge mistake to cast Madonna as Eva Peron, even though she did her level best. Elaine Paige would have been a hundred times better as she has a much better voice and is a much better actor. Watched it in the cinema with my family and clearly Madonna was misplaced, out of her depth and just didn't have the acting skills needed in such an otherwise great production. Elaine Paige had already performed the musical on stage many times, and would have been the natural choice, but unfortunately she wasn't allowed to shine in the movie adaptation.

    I never liked musicals much, and this one is definitely not an exception. Too much music and too little (hi)story... In addition, the movie is also ideologically and politically very clearly oriented to the left, which doesn't help. It simply isn't true that the 'Peronistas' where all good guys, and the others all bad... Who knows, absurdly though, if the military had stayed in power longer like in Chile, maybe Argentina wouldn't have gotten into the sort of financial troubles that have ravaged a once rich and prosperous nation and almost destroyed it altogether (and please note that I am no way a militarist at all)! Surprisingly, the only thing I appreciated was Madonna's singing, which was very good. Otherwise the movie was average.

    The life story of "Evita" as portrayed by pop singer Madonna and directed by Alan Parker. For someone knowing very little about the subject, this film is a quite a chore to sit through. It's over two hours long, without much plot, and we begins with the elaborate funeral of its lead character. Since the subject, Eva Duarte, was evidently engaging, and played by another fascinating woman, the film is disappointing. In one scene, she gives away money by throwing it at people. The material girl's jewels and wardrobe must be worth millions... Lost is why so many remember Evita, but forget Michael J. Brody Jr.... The story is told in operatic fashion. Yet, it is not a traditional opera, or musical - it is like a silent film in color, with dubbed songs and a synchronized sound effects track. In lieu of title cards, handsome Antonio Banderas (as Che) sings about the woman he professes to dislike, but we know he really loves. The dubbing works best with Madonna, who is quite convincing in her "sing acting" - especially on the film's best song, "Don't Cry for Me, Argentina" (a great one, composed by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber), but the melding of music and motion picture is otherwise mechanical. The film lacks heart. ***** Evita (12/14/96) Alan Parker ~ Madonna, Antonio Banderas, Jonathan Pryce, Jimmy Nail

    Good heavens! This film lasted 135 mins - 120-odd mins too long!(there were a couple of good songs). What possessed someone to think, "Hhmm, let's get the cast to tunelessly 'sing' their lines ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE FILM"?!?!? Don't get me wrong, it was quite visually stunning, a great snapshot of a tumultuous historical turning point and all that, but PLEASE, how did people sit through two hours of that?? Despite the film's saving graces (and there were a few), this still makes it into my worst films of all time list, purely because I found it impossible to sit through from start to finish without wanting to pour red-hot magma into my ears!

    Although musicals were a highly theatrical form during the last quarter of the twentieth century, the traditional cinema musical declined during this period; "Evita" was one of the few stage musicals to transfer to the cinema screen. Most cinematic musicals of the period ("Fame" being a good example and "Grease" a rare exception) generally use spoken dialogue to convey emotion, with the characters only singing and dancing in situations where people would sing and dance in real life. "Evita", however, goes to the opposite extreme. It is more like an opera than to a traditional musical, with little spoken dialogue, almost everything being sung. &nbsp; Eva Per&oacute;n was, and remains, a controversial figure, both in her native Argentina and internationally, but there can be little doubt that she was also a remarkable one. (I cannot imagine any other female political leader from Latin America who could have inspired a hit musical). "Evita" has always had a special interest for me, both as a stage production and as a film, because I used to have an Argentine girlfriend, and our first date was to see the stage version; she was able to explain a lot of the political background to me. Eva's husband Juan Per&oacute;n is often thought of, at least in Europe and North America, as a "fascist", but (as my girlfriend was quick to point out) there was a big difference between him and other Latin American leaders referred to by this term. The likes of Pinochet, Stroessner and Galtieri were military strongmen who ruled by force of arms; any support they might have enjoyed among the civilian population came largely from their countries' upper classes. Per&oacute;n, by contrast, was a populist leader with links to the trade unions who enjoyed strong working-class support. Despite his military background he was distrusted by his fellow military leaders and loathed by Argentina's social elite, who saw him as a jumped-up demagogue. Although his regime was undoubtedly an authoritarian one, he was also responsible for instituting many social reforms, and the strength of his legacy can be gauged by the fact that since 1946, Peronist candidates have won eight of the ten Argentine presidential elections that they have not been banned from participating in; the current president, Cristina Kirchner, is a Peronist. Eva played an important role in her husband's rise to power, rallying his supporters when he was arrested by the military dictatorship, and during his time in office she was virtually canonised by the party faithful, who saw her as the "spiritual leader of the nation". The film, like the stage musical, traces her life from her impoverished childhood, through her rise to fame as an actress, her marriage to Per&oacute;n and her time as first lady to her tragic death from cancer at the age of 33. The film essentially tells the same story as the stage show, but makes two major changes. In the stage production, Eva leaves her first lover, the singer Agust&iacute;n Magaldi; in the film he abandons her to return to his wife. The reason, it seems, is to make the young Eva a more sympathetic and vulnerable character, and possibly also to give Madonna the chance to perform one of the show's hit songs, "Another Suitcase in Another Hall", which on stage is sung by Per&oacute;n's mistress. The second major change concerns the character of Che, who here becomes an everyman figure and is not identified with the historical Che Guevara. (It is said that the left-leaning director Alan Parker made this change because he did not like the way Guevara, an idol of the Left, had been treated by the right-leaning lyricist Tim Rice). If anything, the "Che" of the movie is more of a disillusioned Peronist- we see him marching as one of the "descamisados" who sweep Per&oacute;n to power- than a Communist. Madonna has not always struck me as the world's greatest actress, and it was a brave move on Parker's part to cast her here ahead of established actresses like Liza Minnelli and Michelle Pfeiffer. Although she had given decent performances in films like "Desperately Seeking Susan" and "A League of their Own", she had also given some lousy ones, "Body of Evidence" being a notorious example. Parker's gamble paid off; Madonna had campaigned hard for the part, describing it as a "role she was born to play", and was able to make good her boast. She gives here the greatest acting performance of her career, able to bring out all the contrasting sides of Eva's personality, making her not merely a strong and determined woman but also a vulnerable and tragic one. Madonna, of course, was a singer before she was an actress, so may have been helped by the fact that her role is almost entirely sung rather than spoken. Jonathan Pryce is also good as Per&oacute;n, played here less passionate and less determined than his wife, but also a wily political opportunist. Antonio Banderas makes a charismatic Che, although I felt his singing voice was not always up to the role. The film's great strength, of course, is the combination of Rice's lyrics and Andrew Lloyd Webber's music, which combine to produce some of the most memorable songs in the modern musical theatre. Sometimes these are mordantly cynical ("Oh What a Circus", "Goodnight and Thank You", "Peron's Latest Flame"), sometimes lyrical and poignant.( "Another Suitcase in Another Hall", "Don't Cry for Me Argentina"), and sometimes they manage to combine both moods ("I'd Be Surprisingly Good for You"). I should also mention Parker's direction and his ability to find striking visual images to complement the songs. "Evita" triumphantly proved that, even in the nineties, there was still life in the cinematic musical. A goof. We see Magaldi performing at a concert in 1944, which would have been clever of him, given that he died in 1938.

    I had first heard about Evita through a parody: "SCTV" did a parody ad for a musical called "Indira" about Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi (portrayed by Andrea Martin) which had her singing "Don't Cry for Me, Argentina" with Slim Whitman (Joe Flaherty) warbling the male part before segueing to another song. I then saw the actual commercials for "Evita" with, I think, Patti LuPone and Mandy Patinkin doing those songs I previously saw spoofed on that "SCTV" spot. So over 30 years later, I finally watched the film version of the Andrew Lloyd Webber-Tim Rice musical with Madonna essaying the title role. She's quite good singing songs different from her set list especially on the one original song for the movie-"You Must Love Me". Having her veer from caring to shallow and back was also partly natural especially considering the contradictory versions of Evita's life I read about recounted on Wikipedia after seeing the movie. So, yes, she deserves high praise for taking this role and gets much help from both Antonio Banderas as Che and Jonathan Pryce as Eva's eventual husband, Juan Peron. In summary, I highly enjoyed Evita.

    I am a fan of great musicals ... in this effort I've sat thru a lot of bad ones ('Show Boat', 'Carousel', 'The King and I', etc) ... well you have to wade thru the crap to get to the good stuff such as 'My Fair Lady' (imho the best of all-time) and 'Sound of Music', perhaps 'Chicago' and I'd even put 'jesus Christ Superstar' in that realm (tho again, don't think it's going to be a perfectly accurate biblical retelling) ... not sure why people go to musical theatre to see 'history' ... it has little to nothing to do with it ... but of course Evita has been subject to this criteria since it was a record rock opera OK so 'sound of music wasn't historical accurate either ... get over it ... maria was not the Julie Andrews, everyone's idyllic nanny/mother/saint/whore fantasy ... the real maria was a hateful slave-driving bitch of a stage mother who i am eternally surprised wasn't murdered by those kids ... 'so long, farewell, Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye, i must be jabbing this ice pick in your eye' -- far more accurate ... so let's try and put aside the historical and we'll stick to the musical ... which, in not uncertain terms, is a truly great piece of musical theatre ... i never went to see it when originally out on the theatres and frankly had no interest involving anything Madonna was associated with ... but when it made it to cable i happened to leave it on one day was was floored by Antonia Banderas' performance ... much like the the Stage Manager in 'Our Town', has to carry much of the performance by acting like the Greek chorus and adding little bits of info to help us understand some of the finer points ... not to mention give some of the characters a hard time which is pretty delightful all in all ... he is fabulous and really makes the movie move and work Madonna of course has had plenty of accolades for her performance and it is deserved ... she plays it perfectly ... Alan Parker delivers another great adaptation of a musical (Pink Floyd's 'The Wall' being the other) and perhaps he should do more of these ... he seems to have a good touch with them ... but the musical is really the dynamo that keeps the play surging along ... I am not a fan of most Spanish music, I'm a big fan of most music just not Spanish ... but this music is well done and doesn't annoy me at all ... so perhaps it's not so Spanish ... the final scene between Evita and Che as they have their dance during Evita's surgery hallucination is as good as any scene ever in any musical ... the musical is surging and moving and the dance of desire and disgust is perfect as the betrayed everyman represented by Che and the haughty Evita as truly a great climax to the play ... this is well worth several viewings since there are subtleties especially in Banderas' performance that had so much wit and humor that they should not be missed

    I usually try to keep my opinions to myself until I actually review a film on IMDb, but this time I got on my feet and I booed with the rest of the angry mob. I would have thrown fruit if I'd had some. This is the silliest thing to come out of South America since the movie "Medell&iacute;n". It's overacted, it's under-directed and it's paced like a SNAIL. Oh, and did I mention it's long? You know, it's a real disappointment for me because I had Madonna on my list of stars to watch in 1994. And now I think I'm gonna have her on my list of stars to watch fade in 1996.

    I can't tell you how disappointing this film is. The stage version is brilliant and this miscast, misdirected film version is a complete failure. Note; Madonna only received a Golden Globe Award which is SO telling! I'm convinced the GG can be purchased. All kinds of songs were chopped and there was no choreography! Go see the stage version! Madonna's weakness as a singer is clear. She should stick to pop music and video "acting". The wardrobe was done very well but certainly not enough of a reason to see this waste of money. What a shame that every big actress in town wanted this role and this is how it wound up. All of the men were miscast as well. Especially Magaldi.

    Ignore the IMDb average rating, which is increasingly becoming worse at indicating the quality of a film. In the interim between 1978 and 1996, the story had become more timely. Those watching the film in 1997 couldn't have failed to see the parallel between this and Princess Diana's death. Comparing the two gives some idea of how the Argetinians felt towards Eva. Madonna proves to be an ideal choice. I've never been particularly interested in Madonna, but she captures the attention of the audience throughout. She plays her journey from naive girl to politicised woman smoothly and believably, seeming to identify with Eva on some level. Vocally, she does not have a musical theatre voice but then Broadway belting isn't appropriate in a modern movie musicals. Her voice is thin but very pleasant to listen to and appropriately intimate for songs like "Another Suitcase in Another Hall" (which in the stage version is sung by a minor character) and "I'd Be Surprisingly Good For You". Eva's methods of getting to the top- bed-hopping until she finds the right bed- may seem dubious, but it's not inconceivable to think that a beautiful young woman with no social standing would use all that she does have to climb to a position where she won't need to use that. Because Eva does seem genuinely nice, Che (Antonio Banderas) becomes less sympathetic. Che is the working man who appears throughout Eva's life in various guises, casting doubt on whether she is nothing more than an actress. Banderas' voice has character and it works well with the film but it's not a very musical voice. Perhaps it is appropriate that this working class man, the voice of reality, should have a rougher voice. As Juan Peron, Jonathan Pryce's part is relatively small yet he remains convincing. He's no great singer but the acting that comes through in his singing more than compensates. His love for Eva and her love for him is completely believable, almost heartbreaking. Those unfamiliar with South American politics may find themselves confused at points in the film but the story is abstract enough to have power on its own, and perhaps is best treated as that rather than a historical documentary. The film is also completely sung-through, apart from a few lines, so fans of Les Miserables and Phantom of The Opera should definitely watch this. For those who aren't used to that style, if you keep an open mind, you'll find yourself swept along, as happened with The Artist. Unlike some of his other musicals, Andrew Lloyd Webber (with Tim Rice as lyricist) has created songs that are fully integrated into the narrative. Evita is one of his more sophisticated shows and proof that the dichotomy between popular musicals and serious musicals is false. "Don't Cry For Me Argentina" is the most well-known but there are many great ones: "Oh What A Circus", "Good Night and Good Luck", "I'd Be Surprisingly Good For You", etc. Films with this emotional power are rare, so track it down now!

    Although musicals were a highly theatrical form during the last quarter of the twentieth century, the traditional cinema musical declined during this period; "Evita" was one of the few stage musicals to transfer to the cinema screen. Most cinematic musicals of the period ("Fame" being a good example and "Grease" a rare exception) generally use spoken dialogue to convey emotion, with the characters only singing and dancing in situations where people would sing and dance in real life. "Evita", however, goes to the opposite extreme. It is more like an opera than to a traditional musical, with little spoken dialogue, almost everything being sung. &nbsp; Eva Per&oacute;n was, and remains, a controversial figure, both in her native Argentina and internationally, but there can be little doubt that she was also a remarkable one. (I cannot imagine any other female political leader from Latin America who could have inspired a hit musical). "Evita" has always had a special interest for me, both as a stage production and as a film, because I used to have an Argentine girlfriend, and our first date was to see the stage version; she was able to explain a lot of the political background to me. Eva's husband Juan Per&oacute;n is often thought of, at least in Europe and North America, as a "fascist", but (as my girlfriend was quick to point out) there was a big difference between him and other Latin American leaders referred to by this term. The likes of Pinochet, Stroessner and Galtieri were military strongmen who ruled by force of arms; any support they might have enjoyed among the civilian population came largely from their countries' upper classes. Per&oacute;n, by contrast, was a populist leader with links to the trade unions who enjoyed strong working-class support. Despite his military background he was distrusted by his fellow military leaders and loathed by Argentina's social elite, who saw him as a jumped-up demagogue. Although his regime was undoubtedly an authoritarian one, he was also responsible for instituting many social reforms, and the strength of his legacy can be gauged by the fact that since 1946, Peronist candidates have won eight of the ten Argentine presidential elections that they have not been banned from participating in; the current president, Cristina Kirchner, is a Peronist. Eva played an important role in her husband's rise to power, rallying his supporters when he was arrested by the military dictatorship, and during his time in office she was virtually canonised by the party faithful, who saw her as the "spiritual leader of the nation". The film, like the stage musical, traces her life from her impoverished childhood, through her rise to fame as an actress, her marriage to Per&oacute;n and her time as first lady to her tragic death from cancer at the age of 33. The film essentially tells the same story as the stage show, but makes two major changes. In the stage production, Eva leaves her first lover, the singer Agust&iacute;n Magaldi; in the film he abandons her to return to his wife. The reason, it seems, is to make the young Eva a more sympathetic and vulnerable character, and possibly also to give Madonna the chance to perform one of the show's hit songs, "Another Suitcase in Another Hall", which on stage is sung by Per&oacute;n's mistress. The second major change concerns the character of Che, who here becomes an everyman figure and is not identified with the historical Che Guevara. (It is said that the left-leaning director Alan Parker made this change because he did not like the way Guevara, an idol of the Left, had been treated by the right-leaning lyricist Tim Rice). If anything, the "Che" of the movie is more of a disillusioned Peronist- we see him marching as one of the "descamisados" who sweep Per&oacute;n to power- than a Communist. Madonna has not always struck me as the world's greatest actress, and it was a brave move on Parker's part to cast her here ahead of established actresses like Liza Minnelli and Michelle Pfeiffer. Although she had given decent performances in films like "Desperately Seeking Susan" and "A League of their Own", she had also given some lousy ones, "Body of Evidence" being a notorious example. Parker's gamble paid off; Madonna had campaigned hard for the part, describing it as a "role she was born to play", and was able to make good her boast. She gives here the greatest acting performance of her career, able to bring out all the contrasting sides of Eva's personality, making her not merely a strong and determined woman but also a vulnerable and tragic one. Madonna, of course, was a singer before she was an actress, so may have been helped by the fact that her role is almost entirely sung rather than spoken. Jonathan Pryce is also good as Per&oacute;n, played here less passionate and less determined than his wife, but also a wily political opportunist. Antonio Banderas makes a charismatic Che, although I felt his singing voice was not always up to the role. The film's great strength, of course, is the combination of Rice's lyrics and Andrew Lloyd Webber's music, which combine to produce some of the most memorable songs in the modern musical theatre. Sometimes these are mordantly cynical ("Oh What a Circus", "Goodnight and Thank You", "Peron's Latest Flame"), sometimes lyrical and poignant.( "Another Suitcase in Another Hall", "Don't Cry for Me Argentina"), and sometimes they manage to combine both moods ("I'd Be Surprisingly Good for You"). I should also mention Parker's direction and his ability to find striking visual images to complement the songs. "Evita" triumphantly proved that, even in the nineties, there was still life in the cinematic musical. A goof. We see Magaldi performing at a concert in 1944, which would have been clever of him, given that he died in 1938.

So, yes, she deserves high praise for taking this role and gets much help from both Antonio Banderas as Che and Jonathan Pryce as Eva's eventual husband, Juan Peron. In summary, I highly enjoyed Evita.

    I am a fan of great musicals ... in this effort I've sat thru a lot of bad ones ('Show Boat', 'Carousel', 'The King and I', etc) ... well you have to wade thru the crap to get to the good stuff such as 'My Fair Lady' (imho the best of all-time) and 'Sound of Music', perhaps 'Chicago' and I'd even put 'jesus Christ Superstar' in that realm (tho again, don't think it's going to be a perfectly accurate biblical retelling) ... not sure why people go to musical theatre to see 'history' ... it has little to nothing to do with it ... but of course Evita has been subject to this criteria since it was a record rock opera OK so 'sound of music wasn't historical accurate either ... get over it ... maria was not the Julie Andrews, everyone's idyllic nanny/mother/saint/whore fantasy ... the real maria was a hateful slave-driving bitch of a stage mother who i am eternally surprised wasn't murdered by those kids ... 'so long, farewell, Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye, i must be jabbing this ice pick in your eye' -- far more accurate ... so let's try and put aside the historical and we'll stick to the musical ... which, in not uncertain terms, is a truly great piece of musical theatre ... i never went to see it when originally out on the theatres and frankly had no interest involving anything Madonna was associated with ... but when it made it to cable i happened to leave it on one day was was floored by Antonia Banderas' performance ... much like the the Stage Manager in 'Our Town', has to carry much of the performance by acting like the Greek chorus and adding little bits of info to help us understand some of the finer points ... not to mention give some of the characters a hard time which is pretty delightful all in all ... he is fabulous and really makes the movie move and work Madonna of course has had plenty of accolades for her performance and it is deserved ... she plays it perfectly ... Alan Parker delivers another great adaptation of a musical (Pink Floyd's 'The Wall' being the other) and perhaps he should do more of these ... he seems to have a good touch with them ... but the musical is really the dynamo that keeps the play surging along ... I am not a fan of most Spanish music, I'm a big fan of most music just not Spanish ... but this music is well done and doesn't annoy me at all ... so perhaps it's not so Spanish ... the final scene between Evita and Che as they have their dance during Evita's surgery hallucination is as good as any scene ever in any musical ... the musical is surging and moving and the dance of desire and disgust is perfect as the betrayed everyman represented by Che and the haughty Evita as truly a great climax to the play ... this is well worth several viewings since there are subtleties especially in Banderas' performance that had so much wit and humor that they should not be missed

    I usually try to keep my opinions to myself until I actually review a film on IMDb, but this time I got on my feet and I booed with the rest of the angry mob. I would have thrown fruit if I'd had some. This is the silliest thing to come out of South America since the movie "Medell&iacute;n". It's overacted, it's under-directed and it's paced like a SNAIL. Oh, and did I mention it's long? You know, it's a real disappointment for me because I had Madonna on my list of stars to watch in 1994. And now I think I'm gonna have her on my list of stars to watch fade in 1996.

    I can't tell you how disappointing this film is. The stage version is brilliant and this miscast, misdirected film version is a complete failure. Note; Madonna only received a Golden Globe Award which is SO telling! I'm convinced the GG can be purchased. All kinds of songs were chopped and there was no choreography! Go see the stage version! Madonna's weakness as a singer is clear. She should stick to pop music and video "acting". The wardrobe was done very well but certainly not enough of a reason to see this waste of money. What a shame that every big actress in town wanted this role and this is how it wound up. All of the men were miscast as well. Especially Magaldi.

    Ignore the IMDb average rating, which is increasingly becoming worse at indicating the quality of a film. In the interim between 1978 and 1996, the story had become more timely. Those watching the film in 1997 couldn't have failed to see the parallel between this and Princess Diana's death. Comparing the two gives some idea of how the Argetinians felt towards Eva. Madonna proves to be an ideal choice. I've never been particularly interested in Madonna, but she captures the attention of the audience throughout. She plays her journey from naive girl to politicised woman smoothly and believably, seeming to identify with Eva on some level. Vocally, she does not have a musical theatre voice but then Broadway belting isn't appropriate in a modern movie musicals. Her voice is thin but very pleasant to listen to and appropriately intimate for songs like "Another Suitcase in Another Hall" (which in the stage version is sung by a minor character) and "I'd Be Surprisingly Good For You". Eva's methods of getting to the top- bed-hopping until she finds the right bed- may seem dubious, but it's not inconceivable to think that a beautiful young woman with no social standing would use all that she does have to climb to a position where she won't need to use that. Because Eva does seem genuinely nice, Che (Antonio Banderas) becomes less sympathetic. Che is the working man who appears throughout Eva's life in various guises, casting doubt on whether she is nothing more than an actress. Banderas' voice has character and it works well with the film but it's not a very musical voice. Perhaps it is appropriate that this working class man, the voice of reality, should have a rougher voice. As Juan Peron, Jonathan Pryce's part is relatively small yet he remains convincing. He's no great singer but the acting that comes through in his singing more than compensates. His love for Eva and her love for him is completely believable, almost heartbreaking. Those unfamiliar with South American politics may find themselves confused at points in the film but the story is abstract enough to have power on its own, and perhaps is best treated as that rather than a historical documentary. The film is also completely sung-through, apart from a few lines, so fans of Les Miserables and Phantom of The Opera should definitely watch this. For those who aren't used to that style, if you keep an open mind, you'll find yourself swept along, as happened with The Artist. Unlike some of his other musicals, Andrew Lloyd Webber (with Tim Rice as lyricist) has created songs that are fully integrated into the narrative. Evita is one of his more sophisticated shows and proof that the dichotomy between popular musicals and serious musicals is false. "Don't Cry For Me Argentina" is the most well-known but there are many great ones: "Oh What A Circus", "Good Night and Good Luck", "I'd Be Surprisingly Good For You", etc. Films with this emotional power are rare, so track it down now!

    The film was fairly good, the music great, Antonio Banderas brilliant as always. However, it was a huge mistake to cast Madonna as Eva Peron, even though she did her level best. Elaine Paige would have been a hundred times better as she has a much better voice and is a much better actor. Watched it in the cinema with my family and clearly Madonna was misplaced, out of her depth and just didn't have the acting skills needed in such an otherwise great production. Elaine Paige had already performed the musical on stage many times, and would have been the natural choice, but unfortunately she wasn't allowed to shine in the movie adaptation.

    I never liked musicals much, and this one is definitely not an exception. Too much music and too little (hi)story... In addition, the movie is also ideologically and politically very clearly oriented to the left, which doesn't help. It simply isn't true that the 'Peronistas' where all good guys, and the others all bad... Who knows, absurdly though, if the military had stayed in power longer like in Chile, maybe Argentina wouldn't have gotten into the sort of financial troubles that have ravaged a once rich and prosperous nation and almost destroyed it altogether (and please note that I am no way a militarist at all)! Surprisingly, the only thing I appreciated was Madonna's singing, which was very good. Otherwise the movie was average.
