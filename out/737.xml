    It's the start of the Gulf war, and everyone in Tel Aviv is nervous about the future, including Talila Katz, a smart, sexy and single Tel Aviv advertising executive. Dumped by her self-centered boyfriend, she gives up on love until she meets Noah, a handsome, charming but emotionally remote engineer. Insecure about her relationship with Noah, pressured by her squabbling parents to get married, and admonished by her unhappily married sister to not get married, Talila grows more confused each day while the sounds and sights of war escalate around her. Based on the best-selling novel by Irit Linur, `Song of the Siren' is a breakthrough movie that presents a new kind of Israeli film heroine: irreverent, audacious, funny and contemptuous of the traditional macho values woven through Israeli society. A box office smash upon its release, this Israeli `Bridget Jones Diary' sold more movie tickets in Israel in 1994 than all other Israeli-made films combined.
