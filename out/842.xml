    This Disney movie charms me now as much as it did...when I watched it -- Sunday Nights (in two parts surely) on "The Wonderful World of Disney" - on TV years ago! Read the other reviews to get details. It's a fine family movie, but unless you "need" some gratuitous scenes, the story will reach anyone! "Pollyanna" is a fine adaptation of "Pollyanna" the novel, a huge 1913 bestseller. This film represents...Walt Disney at his best...with quality actors (wow...just put the top 10 actors' names into IMDb and see how IMPRESSIVE each actor is!!!) The story's essence is captured well in a quality script...and a believable young "Pollyanna" in Hayley Mills. (Note...her father was a great actor also - Sir John Mills.) Am GLAD that Hayley Mills got a special child's Oscar. She deserved it. So Pollyanna wins over her town...and young "tween" Hayley Mills tames Aunt Polly (Jane Wyman), as well as Karl Malden, Adolphe Menjou, Donald Crisp, and many, many other fine actors.

    A saccharine movie that is willing to turn all the screws in order to get an "awww" from the audience. The ending is a shameless attempt to tug heartstrings and offers no resolution. There are several entertaining scenes with a grumpy Agnes Moorehead, best known as the imperious mother from the TV show "Bewitched," and Adolphe Menjou is also entertaining as another local curmudgeon. The cynical attitudes of these characters provide welcome relief from all the rainbows and sunshine that Pollyanna force-feeds people. Karl Malden, better known for any number of classic films from "On the Waterfront" (1954) to "Patton" (1970), does a fine job in the role of the town priest.

    It's surprising how long this epic actually runs - almost two and a half hours - given it doesn't feel like an endurance to watch Hayley Mills as the blissfully naive Pollyanna, barely tolerated by her childless Aunt Polly (Wyman), going on to win the hearts of her adopted community after life-changing encounters and a terrible accident. Steve Corcoran is memorable as the rosy-cheeked little rascal whom Pollyanna befriends, as is Agnes Moorhead as the 'cantankerous' bed-bound spinster with an apparent heart of ice, slowly and surely melted by the unassuming youngster. Others may prefer Adolphe Menjou and his refracted light crystals, while Nancy Olson has a reasonable supporting role as the kindly housekeeper. Richard Egan plays Wyman's love interest, frustrated by her obstinate and negative attitude for which, Pollyanna is just the antidote she privately craves but publicly rejects. It's a typical feel good movie, although the climax is quite confronting if you're ten years old. Plenty of colourful characters of contrast and light-hearted child's play that should entertain the whole family. Not so sure about the patriotic national anthem solo at the film's finale, but otherwise, it's a substantial film that benefits from great performances by Wyman, Moorhead and Mills and consistently watchable.

    It's a film that brings you into the setting with the players. It's fun being in the kitchen with the irascible cook, both before and after her transformation. Didn't you enjoy running around with Nancy as she sneaks her kisses with her handsome beau - James Drury (sigh). What a relief when Pollyanna relieves the tension (just by being a natural girl behind the palm, etc.) at the town meeting and other occasions when Auntie is being her typical unbendable stick in the mud. Pollyanna's eye popping reaction to the brimstone sermon helps out there as well. Now for something really different ... Somehow, thought of "The Strange Love of Martha Ivers" - the situation in reverse. In "Ivers," the niece goes the other way with an arbitrary aunt - very much the other way. She makes the very worst of the situation. Pollyanna's way is much more powerful. Both positive and negative attitudes are contagious. There is a draw in both cases. In Pollyanna, you are drawn up, and people come back for that.

    It is well worth taking another look at POLLYANNA if you and your family have not seen it for a long time. You will be delighted to realize just how subversive this intelligent witty film is. In fact Pollyanna's surname IS Wittier. People who carp that this is a syrupy sweet film and moan about Disney saccharine movies are missing the point. POLLYANNA is a sly film about misuse of power, loneliness, bullying and meanness using a good natured teen to counterpoint a town of adults who have lost their way in their own lives. She has to be a strong opposite in order for each adult to have a revelation about their own unpleasant behavior. The key adult is her Aunt Polly who has not had sex for a long time, as a result she is bitter and bossy and all the town is afraid to stand up to her. Aunt Polly's sexual frustration is pointed out several times because, in a family film as sharp as this you can have very adult situations wrapped in gauze and acceptable as a character flaw. Pollyanna simply by being positive (and clever and funny) has a profound affect on everyone in need of re awakening. Pollyanna even takes on the hypocrisy of the church and the contents of the bible: One astonishing and powerful scene is in an open field on a very hot day with the church Pastor (a terrific Karl Malden) is practicing his latest fire and brimstone scare campaign. Pollyanna visits him and by being her intelligent self politely demolishes his mindset. He is found later by his wife collapsed with a overwhelming awareness of where he has been wrong. He then becomes a catalyst for motivating the town to stand up to Aunt Polly's sabotage of all their lives. What is so deliciously refreshing about POLLYANNA is that is it simple courtesy and commonsense from the mouth of a confident blossoming 13 year old girl (as 'the future') ...the milk mustache scene is completely THERE in mid screen for any slow learners. The direction is terrific and hilarious and there are many big laughs in small moments scattered through the film; Jimmy and the fish, Pollyanna imitating a cow chewing, the granny playing the drums, Pollyanna being handed sandwiches while hiding in a bush in the conservatory.... loads of crowd pleasing moments for a big audience of families to relish. Particularly moving is the whole subplot about the prisms of light. Agnes Moorehead has a hilarious turn as a hypochondriac who comes good and helps find Pollyanna a doll. Many many matching emotional moments all through this film. Adolph Menjou also has a great spot as the town scary man supposedly with a cellar full of slaves and rats. So take my advice and look for the wickedly funny jokes at the expanse of the status quo and have a wonderful time laughing and wiping tears with your kids and you embrace every magnificently produced sly comedy moment of this utterly clever heartwarming film. POLLYANNA is a complete success. Even vintage car enthusiast are included in the delighted audience for this film. The very funny opening scene of the naked boy swinging on a rope will alert you to the fact this is a film with a very wicked agenda. The production values of antiques costumes and gorgeous visuals are as lavish as MY FAIR LADY. And thank your lucky stars that it wasn't remade with Lindsay Lohan as THE PARENT TRAP was.

    i can't say enough great things about this wonderful Disney vehicle that launched Hayley mills career in the sixties. based on the book of the same name, it stars mills as the effervescent Pollyanna as she brings joy and happiness to a small town ruled by her seemingly cold and indifferent aunt played by jane Wyman. with a-list stars such as Richard Egan, Karl malden, Nancy Olsen, Agnes moorehead and countless others, it's an excellently written and direct film from start to finish. while the film runs well over the two hour mark, one doesn't notice as it is well-paced. when the film was released, many male viewing audiences were not interested as they felt the story line was geared more towards women and young girls. there is a lot to like here as the films touches on the many different lives of the towns habitants and how Pollyanna changed them through her charm and presence. she is not one to be deterred or stopped in her tracks by someone who is a grouchy hermit such as Mr. pendergas or Agnes moorehead's character who is chronically ill and forever in her nightgown and bed. somehow, Pollyanna is able to add some sunshine and life into their dreary existence. i especially enjoyed the scenes where the town has a carnival and everyone participates and for once without the rule of aunt Polly, begin to experience the joy and happiness of the good things in life. over-all i suggest everyone see this film at least once. you won't regret it.

    To really appreciate this film, imagine Shirley Temple as Pollyanna. Temple was extraordinarily talented, but her cherubic qualities guaranteed that her Rebecca (of Sunnybrook Farm) would be the cinematic equivalent of a Hallmark card. Rebecca and Pollyanna were similar characters in very different plots (though both were orphans), but Hayley Mills as Pollyanna never even tries to be adorable. In fact, quite the opposite. She's a lanky young girl with pigtails and knock-knees, and she never delivers a saccharine line or maudlin moment. In the course of the movie, she leads a variety of sour adults-- a recluse (Menjou), a crosspatch (Moorehead), a minister (Malden), a curmudgeon (Ian Wolfe), a maid (Mary Grace Canfield), and a spinster aunt (Wyman)-- toward a better humor. At no point is she a cheerleader; indeed, she mostly just asks them questions, showing interest in them, interest that they return, and her good humor gets them to reconsider their grim outlooks. It's simplistic, of course, and even ridiculous (the town seems to have more orphans than citizens). But that is where subtlety comes to the rescue, and craftsmanship. It's a well-made film, particularly in terms of art direction and costumes which were clearly designed with Technicolor in mind. The direction and photography are uninspired, but no great creativity was required because characters and story are the whole point, and the screenplay has elements sophisticated enough for any critic. The early anecdote about crutches foreshadow the climax in just the right way, for instance. Even better is a lovely metaphor about prisms, when Pollyanna enters the home of the recluse who has (don't ask) an endless quantity of lamp prisms in his cluttered mansion. Playing with the prisms, she charms Menjou and later Moorehead, and moviegoers, for whom the prisms are a colorful visual symbol of cheerier points of view. The real subtlety, though, is in the performances. Malden plays his fire-and-brimstone minister to the hilt, and Donald Crisp is a stoutly impassioned mayor. But most of Pollyanna's converts, particularly Wyman and Menjou, deliver quietly supportive, reflective performances. In spite of a story in which the adults are barely believable caricatures, this film was so solidly constructed and underplayed that the children's-book aspect is overwhelmed by the genuinely delightful message, and a marvelously realistic performance by Hayley Mills.

    Considering that Pollyanna was his debut, writer and director David Swift does a very good job here. Pollyanna does have its faults, but it is a solid adaptation of a charming book. Where Pollyanna isn't so strong is in the length and the pacing. At over 2 hours, the film is a little too long, while the film does move fairly slowly. My final flaw is that twenty minutes or so before the end, the tone changes and this change was somewhat jarring. Nonetheless, Pollyanna is exquisitely filmed with stunning cinematography, costumes and scenery, and the music is lovely. The script is well written and the story still has its charm. The direction is as solid as the film itself, while the acting is very good. Hayley Mills gives a spirited performance in the title role, while Agnes Moorehead comes very close to stealing the film. Karl Malden, Jane Wyman and Adolphe Menjou also do great turns as the cheerless citizens whose lives are transformed by Pollyanna. Overall, has its faults but it is a solid and charming film. 7/10 Bethany Cox

    Meredith Wilson's "The Music Man" is really "Pollyanna" with tunes. Professor Hill comes into a small town and changes the lives of the inhabitants for the better in much the same way as Pollyanna herself does.His preference for the "Sadder but wiser girl" would have been satisfied by Miss Nancy Olson and you can easily imagine the townswomen doing "Pick a little-talk a little". About the time this movie was released, Mr Robert Preston was scoring a personal triumph in Wilson's show.By the same token,"Pollyanna" is a personal triumph for Miss Hayley Mills,as much a surprise choice for the part as Vivien Leigh had been for Scarlett O'Hara a generation earlier. Veteran Mr Adolphe Menjou runs her close with a performance that is the sum of everything he had learned in his distinguished career.I found it very moving,a last hurrah worthy of a fine,sensitive actor. "Pollyanna" is not a children's movie,it is however a movie about children told with an innocent eye. Whilst Hayley Mills went on to have a long and successful career - indeed she is still appearing on TV in 2009 - malign fate had a far different destiny waiting for another little girl of her age who was an extra in the movie. The tragic Stephanie Lynn Gorman who can be seen to Hayley's right on the bandstand when she sings "America the beautiful",was raped and murdered at her home in L.A.aged 15.Her killer has never been caught. God rest her soul.

    "Pollyanna" is one of the best films I have seen lately. As in "The Parent Trap," Hayley Mills does an amazing job with her appealing role, for which she won a special Academy Award. Mills plays Pollyanna, an orphan child who comes to a small town to live with her Aunt Polly and ends up reforming and changing the lives of the people of the town. It may sound predictable, and to a point it is, but it is the way in which the story is presented that makes it so good. So many of the scenes in this film are so well done, including Pollyanna bringing joy to a crabby old woman dying in bed, causing the local reverend (Karl Malden) to look for the good in people, and changing the attitudes of the servants in her own household. Consider who these people are at the beginning of the film and who they are by the end and you're bound to find this movie very moving. I admit that I was worried about how this film would end. It looked like it was going to be depressing after all we had been hoping for. Nevertheless, the ending scene is one of the most brilliant I have ever seen, and without giving it away, I have to warn you that it will touch you and bring tears to your eyes no matter who you are. What a great film that touches and inspires. One of Disney's all-time best live action movies. ***1/2 out of ****

    To really appreciate this film, imagine Shirley Temple as Pollyanna. Temple was extraordinarily talented, but her cherubic qualities guaranteed that her Rebecca (of Sunnybrook Farm) would be the cinematic equivalent of a Hallmark card. Rebecca and Pollyanna were similar characters in very different plots (though both were orphans), but Hayley Mills as Pollyanna never even tries to be adorable. In fact, quite the opposite. She's a lanky young girl with pigtails and knock-knees, and she never delivers a saccharine line or maudlin moment. In the course of the movie, she leads a variety of sour adults-- a recluse (Menjou), a crosspatch (Moorehead), a minister (Malden), a curmudgeon (Ian Wolfe), a maid (Mary Grace Canfield), and a spinster aunt (Wyman)-- toward a better humor. At no point is she a cheerleader; indeed, she mostly just asks them questions, showing interest in them, interest that they return, and her good humor gets them to reconsider their grim outlooks. It's simplistic, of course, and even ridiculous (the town seems to have more orphans than citizens). But that is where subtlety comes to the rescue, and craftsmanship.

In spite of a story in which the adults are barely believable caricatures, this film was so solidly constructed and underplayed that the children's-book aspect is overwhelmed by the genuinely delightful message, and a marvelously realistic performance by Hayley Mills.

    Considering that Pollyanna was his debut, writer and director David Swift does a very good job here. Pollyanna does have its faults, but it is a solid adaptation of a charming book. Where Pollyanna isn't so strong is in the length and the pacing. At over 2 hours, the film is a little too long, while the film does move fairly slowly. My final flaw is that twenty minutes or so before the end, the tone changes and this change was somewhat jarring. Nonetheless, Pollyanna is exquisitely filmed with stunning cinematography, costumes and scenery, and the music is lovely. The script is well written and the story still has its charm. The direction is as solid as the film itself, while the acting is very good. Hayley Mills gives a spirited performance in the title role, while Agnes Moorehead comes very close to stealing the film. Karl Malden, Jane Wyman and Adolphe Menjou also do great turns as the cheerless citizens whose lives are transformed by Pollyanna. Overall, has its faults but it is a solid and charming film. 7/10 Bethany Cox

    Meredith Wilson's "The Music Man" is really "Pollyanna" with tunes. Professor Hill comes into a small town and changes the lives of the inhabitants for the better in much the same way as Pollyanna herself does.His preference for the "Sadder but wiser girl" would have been satisfied by Miss Nancy Olson and you can easily imagine the townswomen doing "Pick a little-talk a little". About the time this movie was released, Mr Robert Preston was scoring a personal triumph in Wilson's show.By the same token,"Pollyanna" is a personal triumph for Miss Hayley Mills,as much a surprise choice for the part as Vivien Leigh had been for Scarlett O'Hara a generation earlier. Veteran Mr Adolphe Menjou runs her close with a performance that is the sum of everything he had learned in his distinguished career.I found it very moving,a last hurrah worthy of a fine,sensitive actor. "Pollyanna" is not a children's movie,it is however a movie about children told with an innocent eye. Whilst Hayley Mills went on to have a long and successful career - indeed she is still appearing on TV in 2009 - malign fate had a far different destiny waiting for another little girl of her age who was an extra in the movie. The tragic Stephanie Lynn Gorman who can be seen to Hayley's right on the bandstand when she sings "America the beautiful",was raped and murdered at her home in L.A.aged 15.Her killer has never been caught. God rest her soul.

    "Pollyanna" is one of the best films I have seen lately. As in "The Parent Trap," Hayley Mills does an amazing job with her appealing role, for which she won a special Academy Award. Mills plays Pollyanna, an orphan child who comes to a small town to live with her Aunt Polly and ends up reforming and changing the lives of the people of the town. It may sound predictable, and to a point it is, but it is the way in which the story is presented that makes it so good. So many of the scenes in this film are so well done, including Pollyanna bringing joy to a crabby old woman dying in bed, causing the local reverend (Karl Malden) to look for the good in people, and changing the attitudes of the servants in her own household. Consider who these people are at the beginning of the film and who they are by the end and you're bound to find this movie very moving. I admit that I was worried about how this film would end. It looked like it was going to be depressing after all we had been hoping for. Nevertheless, the ending scene is one of the most brilliant I have ever seen, and without giving it away, I have to warn you that it will touch you and bring tears to your eyes no matter who you are. What a great film that touches and inspires. One of Disney's all-time best live action movies. ***1/2 out of ****

    This Disney movie charms me now as much as it did...when I watched it -- Sunday Nights (in two parts surely) on "The Wonderful World of Disney" - on TV years ago! Read the other reviews to get details. It's a fine family movie, but unless you "need" some gratuitous scenes, the story will reach anyone! "Pollyanna" is a fine adaptation of "Pollyanna" the novel, a huge 1913 bestseller. This film represents...Walt Disney at his best...with quality actors (wow...just put the top 10 actors' names into IMDb and see how IMPRESSIVE each actor is!!!) The story's essence is captured well in a quality script...and a believable young "Pollyanna" in Hayley Mills. (Note...her father was a great actor also - Sir John Mills.) Am GLAD that Hayley Mills got a special child's Oscar. She deserved it. So Pollyanna wins over her town...and young "tween" Hayley Mills tames Aunt Polly (Jane Wyman), as well as Karl Malden, Adolphe Menjou, Donald Crisp, and many, many other fine actors.

    A saccharine movie that is willing to turn all the screws in order to get an "awww" from the audience. The ending is a shameless attempt to tug heartstrings and offers no resolution. There are several entertaining scenes with a grumpy Agnes Moorehead, best known as the imperious mother from the TV show "Bewitched," and Adolphe Menjou is also entertaining as another local curmudgeon. The cynical attitudes of these characters provide welcome relief from all the rainbows and sunshine that Pollyanna force-feeds people. Karl Malden, better known for any number of classic films from "On the Waterfront" (1954) to "Patton" (1970), does a fine job in the role of the town priest.

    It's surprising how long this epic actually runs - almost two and a half hours - given it doesn't feel like an endurance to watch Hayley Mills as the blissfully naive Pollyanna, barely tolerated by her childless Aunt Polly (Wyman), going on to win the hearts of her adopted community after life-changing encounters and a terrible accident. Steve Corcoran is memorable as the rosy-cheeked little rascal whom Pollyanna befriends, as is Agnes Moorhead as the 'cantankerous' bed-bound spinster with an apparent heart of ice, slowly and surely melted by the unassuming youngster. Others may prefer Adolphe Menjou and his refracted light crystals, while Nancy Olson has a reasonable supporting role as the kindly housekeeper. Richard Egan plays Wyman's love interest, frustrated by her obstinate and negative attitude for which, Pollyanna is just the antidote she privately craves but publicly rejects. It's a typical feel good movie, although the climax is quite confronting if you're ten years old. Plenty of colourful characters of contrast and light-hearted child's play that should entertain the whole family. Not so sure about the patriotic national anthem solo at the film's finale, but otherwise, it's a substantial film that benefits from great performances by Wyman, Moorhead and Mills and consistently watchable.

    It's a film that brings you into the setting with the players. It's fun being in the kitchen with the irascible cook, both before and after her transformation. Didn't you enjoy running around with Nancy as she sneaks her kisses with her handsome beau - James Drury (sigh). What a relief when Pollyanna relieves the tension (just by being a natural girl behind the palm, etc.) at the town meeting and other occasions when Auntie is being her typical unbendable stick in the mud. Pollyanna's eye popping reaction to the brimstone sermon helps out there as well. Now for something really different ... Somehow, thought of "The Strange Love of Martha Ivers" - the situation in reverse. In "Ivers," the niece goes the other way with an arbitrary aunt - very much the other way. She makes the very worst of the situation. Pollyanna's way is much more powerful. Both positive and negative attitudes are contagious. There is a draw in both cases. In Pollyanna, you are drawn up, and people come back for that.

    It is well worth taking another look at POLLYANNA if you and your family have not seen it for a long time. You will be delighted to realize just how subversive this intelligent witty film is. In fact Pollyanna's surname IS Wittier. People who carp that this is a syrupy sweet film and moan about Disney saccharine movies are missing the point. POLLYANNA is a sly film about misuse of power, loneliness, bullying and meanness using a good natured teen to counterpoint a town of adults who have lost their way in their own lives. She has to be a strong opposite in order for each adult to have a revelation about their own unpleasant behavior. The key adult is her Aunt Polly who has not had sex for a long time, as a result she is bitter and bossy and all the town is afraid to stand up to her. Aunt Polly's sexual frustration is pointed out several times because, in a family film as sharp as this you can have very adult situations wrapped in gauze and acceptable as a character flaw. Pollyanna simply by being positive (and clever and funny) has a profound affect on everyone in need of re awakening. Pollyanna even takes on the hypocrisy of the church and the contents of the bible: One astonishing and powerful scene is in an open field on a very hot day with the church Pastor (a terrific Karl Malden) is practicing his latest fire and brimstone scare campaign. Pollyanna visits him and by being her intelligent self politely demolishes his mindset. He is found later by his wife collapsed with a overwhelming awareness of where he has been wrong. He then becomes a catalyst for motivating the town to stand up to Aunt Polly's sabotage of all their lives. What is so deliciously refreshing about POLLYANNA is that is it simple courtesy and commonsense from the mouth of a confident blossoming 13 year old girl (as 'the future') ...the milk mustache scene is completely THERE in mid screen for any slow learners. The direction is terrific and hilarious and there are many big laughs in small moments scattered through the film; Jimmy and the fish, Pollyanna imitating a cow chewing, the granny playing the drums, Pollyanna being handed sandwiches while hiding in a bush in the conservatory.... loads of crowd pleasing moments for a big audience of families to relish. Particularly moving is the whole subplot about the prisms of light. Agnes Moorehead has a hilarious turn as a hypochondriac who comes good and helps find Pollyanna a doll. Many many matching emotional moments all through this film. Adolph Menjou also has a great spot as the town scary man supposedly with a cellar full of slaves and rats. So take my advice and look for the wickedly funny jokes at the expanse of the status quo and have a wonderful time laughing and wiping tears with your kids and you embrace every magnificently produced sly comedy moment of this utterly clever heartwarming film. POLLYANNA is a complete success. Even vintage car enthusiast are included in the delighted audience for this film. The very funny opening scene of the naked boy swinging on a rope will alert you to the fact this is a film with a very wicked agenda. The production values of antiques costumes and gorgeous visuals are as lavish as MY FAIR LADY. And thank your lucky stars that it wasn't remade with Lindsay Lohan as THE PARENT TRAP was.

    i can't say enough great things about this wonderful Disney vehicle that launched Hayley mills career in the sixties. based on the book of the same name, it stars mills as the effervescent Pollyanna as she brings joy and happiness to a small town ruled by her seemingly cold and indifferent aunt played by jane Wyman. with a-list stars such as Richard Egan, Karl malden, Nancy Olsen, Agnes moorehead and countless others, it's an excellently written and direct film from start to finish. while the film runs well over the two hour mark, one doesn't notice as it is well-paced. when the film was released, many male viewing audiences were not interested as they felt the story line was geared more towards women and young girls. there is a lot to like here as the films touches on the many different lives of the towns habitants and how Pollyanna changed them through her charm and presence. she is not one to be deterred or stopped in her tracks by someone who is a grouchy hermit such as Mr. pendergas or Agnes moorehead's character who is chronically ill and forever in her nightgown and bed. somehow, Pollyanna is able to add some sunshine and life into their dreary existence. i especially enjoyed the scenes where the town has a carnival and everyone participates and for once without the rule of aunt Polly, begin to experience the joy and happiness of the good things in life. over-all i suggest everyone see this film at least once. you won't regret it.

    To really appreciate this film, imagine Shirley Temple as Pollyanna. Temple was extraordinarily talented, but her cherubic qualities guaranteed that her Rebecca (of Sunnybrook Farm) would be the cinematic equivalent of a Hallmark card. Rebecca and Pollyanna were similar characters in very different plots (though both were orphans), but Hayley Mills as Pollyanna never even tries to be adorable. In fact, quite the opposite. She's a lanky young girl with pigtails and knock-knees, and she never delivers a saccharine line or maudlin moment. In the course of the movie, she leads a variety of sour adults-- a recluse (Menjou), a crosspatch (Moorehead), a minister (Malden), a curmudgeon (Ian Wolfe), a maid (Mary Grace Canfield), and a spinster aunt (Wyman)-- toward a better humor. At no point is she a cheerleader; indeed, she mostly just asks them questions, showing interest in them, interest that they return, and her good humor gets them to reconsider their grim outlooks. It's simplistic, of course, and even ridiculous (the town seems to have more orphans than citizens). But that is where subtlety comes to the rescue, and craftsmanship. It's a well-made film, particularly in terms of art direction and costumes which were clearly designed with Technicolor in mind. The direction and photography are uninspired, but no great creativity was required because characters and story are the whole point, and the screenplay has elements sophisticated enough for any critic. The early anecdote about crutches foreshadow the climax in just the right way, for instance. Even better is a lovely metaphor about prisms, when Pollyanna enters the home of the recluse who has (don't ask) an endless quantity of lamp prisms in his cluttered mansion. Playing with the prisms, she charms Menjou and later Moorehead, and moviegoers, for whom the prisms are a colorful visual symbol of cheerier points of view. The real subtlety, though, is in the performances. Malden plays his fire-and-brimstone minister to the hilt, and Donald Crisp is a stoutly impassioned mayor. But most of Pollyanna's converts, particularly Wyman and Menjou, deliver quietly supportive, reflective performances. In spite of a story in which the adults are barely believable caricatures, this film was so solidly constructed and underplayed that the children's-book aspect is overwhelmed by the genuinely delightful message, and a marvelously realistic performance by Hayley Mills.

    i can't say enough great things about this wonderful Disney vehicle that launched Hayley mills career in the sixties. based on the book of the same name, it stars mills as the effervescent Pollyanna as she brings joy and happiness to a small town ruled by her seemingly cold and indifferent aunt played by jane Wyman. with a-list stars such as Richard Egan, Karl malden, Nancy Olsen, Agnes moorehead and countless others, it's an excellently written and direct film from start to finish. while the film runs well over the two hour mark, one doesn't notice as it is well-paced. when the film was released, many male viewing audiences were not interested as they felt the story line was geared more towards women and young girls. there is a lot to like here as the films touches on the many different lives of the towns habitants and how Pollyanna changed them through her charm and presence. she is not one to be deterred or stopped in her tracks by someone who is a grouchy hermit such as Mr. pendergas or Agnes moorehead's character who is chronically ill and forever in her nightgown and bed. somehow, Pollyanna is able to add some sunshine and life into their dreary existence. i especially enjoyed the scenes where the town has a carnival and everyone participates and for once without the rule of aunt Polly, begin to experience the joy and happiness of the good things in life. over-all i suggest everyone see this film at least once. you won't regret it.

    To really appreciate this film, imagine Shirley Temple as Pollyanna. Temple was extraordinarily talented, but her cherubic qualities guaranteed that her Rebecca (of Sunnybrook Farm) would be the cinematic equivalent of a Hallmark card. Rebecca and Pollyanna were similar characters in very different plots (though both were orphans), but Hayley Mills as Pollyanna never even tries to be adorable. In fact, quite the opposite. She's a lanky young girl with pigtails and knock-knees, and she never delivers a saccharine line or maudlin moment. In the course of the movie, she leads a variety of sour adults-- a recluse (Menjou), a crosspatch (Moorehead), a minister (Malden), a curmudgeon (Ian Wolfe), a maid (Mary Grace Canfield), and a spinster aunt (Wyman)-- toward a better humor. At no point is she a cheerleader; indeed, she mostly just asks them questions, showing interest in them, interest that they return, and her good humor gets them to reconsider their grim outlooks. It's simplistic, of course, and even ridiculous (the town seems to have more orphans than citizens). But that is where subtlety comes to the rescue, and craftsmanship. It's a well-made film, particularly in terms of art direction and costumes which were clearly designed with Technicolor in mind. The direction and photography are uninspired, but no great creativity was required because characters and story are the whole point, and the screenplay has elements sophisticated enough for any critic. The early anecdote about crutches foreshadow the climax in just the right way, for instance. Even better is a lovely metaphor about prisms, when Pollyanna enters the home of the recluse who has (don't ask) an endless quantity of lamp prisms in his cluttered mansion. Playing with the prisms, she charms Menjou and later Moorehead, and moviegoers, for whom the prisms are a colorful visual symbol of cheerier points of view. The real subtlety, though, is in the performances. Malden plays his fire-and-brimstone minister to the hilt, and Donald Crisp is a stoutly impassioned mayor. But most of Pollyanna's converts, particularly Wyman and Menjou, deliver quietly supportive, reflective performances. In spite of a story in which the adults are barely believable caricatures, this film was so solidly constructed and underplayed that the children's-book aspect is overwhelmed by the genuinely delightful message, and a marvelously realistic performance by Hayley Mills.

    Considering that Pollyanna was his debut, writer and director David Swift does a very good job here. Pollyanna does have its faults, but it is a solid adaptation of a charming book. Where Pollyanna isn't so strong is in the length and the pacing. At over 2 hours, the film is a little too long, while the film does move fairly slowly. My final flaw is that twenty minutes or so before the end, the tone changes and this change was somewhat jarring. Nonetheless, Pollyanna is exquisitely filmed with stunning cinematography, costumes and scenery, and the music is lovely. The script is well written and the story still has its charm. The direction is as solid as the film itself, while the acting is very good. Hayley Mills gives a spirited performance in the title role, while Agnes Moorehead comes very close to stealing the film. Karl Malden, Jane Wyman and Adolphe Menjou also do great turns as the cheerless citizens whose lives are transformed by Pollyanna. Overall, has its faults but it is a solid and charming film. 7/10 Bethany Cox

    Meredith Wilson's "The Music Man" is really "Pollyanna" with tunes. Professor Hill comes into a small town and changes the lives of the inhabitants for the better in much the same way as Pollyanna herself does.His preference for the "Sadder but wiser girl" would have been satisfied by Miss Nancy Olson and you can easily imagine the townswomen doing "Pick a little-talk a little". About the time this movie was released, Mr Robert Preston was scoring a personal triumph in Wilson's show.By the same token,"Pollyanna" is a personal triumph for Miss Hayley Mills,as much a surprise choice for the part as Vivien Leigh had been for Scarlett O'Hara a generation earlier. Veteran Mr Adolphe Menjou runs her close with a performance that is the sum of everything he had learned in his distinguished career.I found it very moving,a last hurrah worthy of a fine,sensitive actor. "Pollyanna" is not a children's movie,it is however a movie about children told with an innocent eye. Whilst Hayley Mills went on to have a long and successful career - indeed she is still appearing on TV in 2009 - malign fate had a far different destiny waiting for another little girl of her age who was an extra in the movie. The tragic Stephanie Lynn Gorman who can be seen to Hayley's right on the bandstand when she sings "America the beautiful",was raped and murdered at her home in L.A.aged 15.Her killer has never been caught. God rest her soul.

    "Pollyanna" is one of the best films I have seen lately. As in "The Parent Trap," Hayley Mills does an amazing job with her appealing role, for which she won a special Academy Award. Mills plays Pollyanna, an orphan child who comes to a small town to live with her Aunt Polly and ends up reforming and changing the lives of the people of the town. It may sound predictable, and to a point it is, but it is the way in which the story is presented that makes it so good. So many of the scenes in this film are so well done, including Pollyanna bringing joy to a crabby old woman dying in bed, causing the local reverend (Karl Malden) to look for the good in people, and changing the attitudes of the servants in her own household. Consider who these people are at the beginning of the film and who they are by the end and you're bound to find this movie very moving. I admit that I was worried about how this film would end. It looked like it was going to be depressing after all we had been hoping for. Nevertheless, the ending scene is one of the most brilliant I have ever seen, and without giving it away, I have to warn you that it will touch you and bring tears to your eyes no matter who you are. What a great film that touches and inspires. One of Disney's all-time best live action movies. ***1/2 out of ****

    This Disney movie charms me now as much as it did...when I watched it -- Sunday Nights (in two parts surely) on "The Wonderful World of Disney" - on TV years ago! Read the other reviews to get details. It's a fine family movie, but unless you "need" some gratuitous scenes, the story will reach anyone! "Pollyanna" is a fine adaptation of "Pollyanna" the novel, a huge 1913 bestseller. This film represents...Walt Disney at his best...with quality actors (wow...just put the top 10 actors' names into IMDb and see how IMPRESSIVE each actor is!!!) The story's essence is captured well in a quality script...and a believable young "Pollyanna" in Hayley Mills. (Note...her father was a great actor also - Sir John Mills.) Am GLAD that Hayley Mills got a special child's Oscar. She deserved it. So Pollyanna wins over her town...and young "tween" Hayley Mills tames Aunt Polly (Jane Wyman), as well as Karl Malden, Adolphe Menjou, Donald Crisp, and many, many other fine actors.

    A saccharine movie that is willing to turn all the screws in order to get an "awww" from the audience. The ending is a shameless attempt to tug heartstrings and offers no resolution. There are several entertaining scenes with a grumpy Agnes Moorehead, best known as the imperious mother from the TV show "Bewitched," and Adolphe Menjou is also entertaining as another local curmudgeon. The cynical attitudes of these characters provide welcome relief from all the rainbows and sunshine that Pollyanna force-feeds people. Karl Malden, better known for any number of classic films from "On the Waterfront" (1954) to "Patton" (1970), does a fine job in the role of the town priest.

    It's surprising how long this epic actually runs - almost two and a half hours - given it doesn't feel like an endurance to watch Hayley Mills as the blissfully naive Pollyanna, barely tolerated by her childless Aunt Polly (Wyman), going on to win the hearts of her adopted community after life-changing encounters and a terrible accident. Steve Corcoran is memorable as the rosy-cheeked little rascal whom Pollyanna befriends, as is Agnes Moorhead as the 'cantankerous' bed-bound spinster with an apparent heart of ice, slowly and surely melted by the unassuming youngster. Others may prefer Adolphe Menjou and his refracted light crystals, while Nancy Olson has a reasonable supporting role as the kindly housekeeper. Richard Egan plays Wyman's love interest, frustrated by her obstinate and negative attitude for which, Pollyanna is just the antidote she privately craves but publicly rejects. It's a typical feel good movie, although the climax is quite confronting if you're ten years old. Plenty of colourful characters of contrast and light-hearted child's play that should entertain the whole family. Not so sure about the patriotic national anthem solo at the film's finale, but otherwise, it's a substantial film that benefits from great performances by Wyman, Moorhead and Mills and consistently watchable.

    It's a film that brings you into the setting with the players. It's fun being in the kitchen with the irascible cook, both before and after her transformation. Didn't you enjoy running around with Nancy as she sneaks her kisses with her handsome beau - James Drury (sigh). What a relief when Pollyanna relieves the tension (just by being a natural girl behind the palm, etc.) at the town meeting and other occasions when Auntie is being her typical unbendable stick in the mud. Pollyanna's eye popping reaction to the brimstone sermon helps out there as well. Now for something really different ... Somehow, thought of "The Strange Love of Martha Ivers" - the situation in reverse. In "Ivers," the niece goes the other way with an arbitrary aunt - very much the other way. She makes the very worst of the situation. Pollyanna's way is much more powerful. Both positive and negative attitudes are contagious. There is a draw in both cases. In Pollyanna, you are drawn up, and people come back for that.

    It is well worth taking another look at POLLYANNA if you and your family have not seen it for a long time. You will be delighted to realize just how subversive this intelligent witty film is. In fact Pollyanna's surname IS Wittier. People who carp that this is a syrupy sweet film and moan about Disney saccharine movies are missing the point. POLLYANNA is a sly film about misuse of power, loneliness, bullying and meanness using a good natured teen to counterpoint a town of adults who have lost their way in their own lives. She has to be a strong opposite in order for each adult to have a revelation about their own unpleasant behavior. The key adult is her Aunt Polly who has not had sex for a long time, as a result she is bitter and bossy and all the town is afraid to stand up to her. Aunt Polly's sexual frustration is pointed out several times because, in a family film as sharp as this you can have very adult situations wrapped in gauze and acceptable as a character flaw. Pollyanna simply by being positive (and clever and funny) has a profound affect on everyone in need of re awakening. Pollyanna even takes on the hypocrisy of the church and the contents of the bible: One astonishing and powerful scene is in an open field on a very hot day with the church Pastor (a terrific Karl Malden) is practicing his latest fire and brimstone scare campaign. Pollyanna visits him and by being her intelligent self politely demolishes his mindset. He is found later by his wife collapsed with a overwhelming awareness of where he has been wrong. He then becomes a catalyst for motivating the town to stand up to Aunt Polly's sabotage of all their lives. What is so deliciously refreshing about POLLYANNA is that is it simple courtesy and commonsense from the mouth of a confident blossoming 13 year old girl (as 'the future') ...the milk mustache scene is completely THERE in mid screen for any slow learners. The direction is terrific and hilarious and there are many big laughs in small moments scattered through the film; Jimmy and the fish, Pollyanna imitating a cow chewing, the granny playing the drums, Pollyanna being handed sandwiches while hiding in a bush in the conservatory.... loads of crowd pleasing moments for a big audience of families to relish. Particularly moving is the whole subplot about the prisms of light. Agnes Moorehead has a hilarious turn as a hypochondriac who comes good and helps find Pollyanna a doll. Many many matching emotional moments all through this film. Adolph Menjou also has a great spot as the town scary man supposedly with a cellar full of slaves and rats. So take my advice and look for the wickedly funny jokes at the expanse of the status quo and have a wonderful time laughing and wiping tears with your kids and you embrace every magnificently produced sly comedy moment of this utterly clever heartwarming film. POLLYANNA is a complete success. Even vintage car enthusiast are included in the delighted audience for this film. The very funny opening scene of the naked boy swinging on a rope will alert you to the fact this is a film with a very wicked agenda. The production values of antiques costumes and gorgeous visuals are as lavish as MY FAIR LADY. And thank your lucky stars that it wasn't remade with Lindsay Lohan as THE PARENT TRAP was.

    To really appreciate this film, imagine Shirley Temple as Pollyanna. Temple was extraordinarily talented, but her cherubic qualities guaranteed that her Rebecca (of Sunnybrook Farm) would be the cinematic equivalent of a Hallmark card. Rebecca and Pollyanna were similar characters in very different plots (though both were orphans), but Hayley Mills as Pollyanna never even tries to be adorable. In fact, quite the opposite. She's a lanky young girl with pigtails and knock-knees, and she never delivers a saccharine line or maudlin moment. In the course of the movie, she leads a variety of sour adults-- a recluse (Menjou), a crosspatch (Moorehead), a minister (Malden), a curmudgeon (Ian Wolfe), a maid (Mary Grace Canfield), and a spinster aunt (Wyman)-- toward a better humor. At no point is she a cheerleader; indeed, she mostly just asks them questions, showing interest in them, interest that they return, and her good humor gets them to reconsider their grim outlooks.

In fact Pollyanna's surname IS Wittier. People who carp that this is a syrupy sweet film and moan about Disney saccharine movies are missing the point. POLLYANNA is a sly film about misuse of power, loneliness, bullying and meanness using a good natured teen to counterpoint a town of adults who have lost their way in their own lives. She has to be a strong opposite in order for each adult to have a revelation about their own unpleasant behavior. The key adult is her Aunt Polly who has not had sex for a long time, as a result she is bitter and bossy and all the town is afraid to stand up to her. Aunt Polly's sexual frustration is pointed out several times because, in a family film as sharp as this you can have very adult situations wrapped in gauze and acceptable as a character flaw. Pollyanna simply by being positive (and clever and funny) has a profound affect on everyone in need of re awakening. Pollyanna even takes on the hypocrisy of the church and the contents of the bible: One astonishing and powerful scene is in an open field on a very hot day with the church Pastor (a terrific Karl Malden) is practicing his latest fire and brimstone scare campaign. Pollyanna visits him and by being her intelligent self politely demolishes his mindset. He is found later by his wife collapsed with a overwhelming awareness of where he has been wrong. He then becomes a catalyst for motivating the town to stand up to Aunt Polly's sabotage of all their lives. What is so deliciously refreshing about POLLYANNA is that is it simple courtesy and commonsense from the mouth of a confident blossoming 13 year old girl (as 'the future') ...the milk mustache scene is completely THERE in mid screen for any slow learners. The direction is terrific and hilarious and there are many big laughs in small moments scattered through the film; Jimmy and the fish, Pollyanna imitating a cow chewing, the granny playing the drums, Pollyanna being handed sandwiches while hiding in a bush in the conservatory.... loads of crowd pleasing moments for a big audience of families to relish. Particularly moving is the whole subplot about the prisms of light. Agnes Moorehead has a hilarious turn as a hypochondriac who comes good and helps find Pollyanna a doll. Many many matching emotional moments all through this film. Adolph Menjou also has a great spot as the town scary man supposedly with a cellar full of slaves and rats. So take my advice and look for the wickedly funny jokes at the expanse of the status quo and have a wonderful time laughing and wiping tears with your kids and you embrace every magnificently produced sly comedy moment of this utterly clever heartwarming film. POLLYANNA is a complete success. Even vintage car enthusiast are included in the delighted audience for this film. The very funny opening scene of the naked boy swinging on a rope will alert you to the fact this is a film with a very wicked agenda. The production values of antiques costumes and gorgeous visuals are as lavish as MY FAIR LADY. And thank your lucky stars that it wasn't remade with Lindsay Lohan as THE PARENT TRAP was.

    i can't say enough great things about this wonderful Disney vehicle that launched Hayley mills career in the sixties. based on the book of the same name, it stars mills as the effervescent Pollyanna as she brings joy and happiness to a small town ruled by her seemingly cold and indifferent aunt played by jane Wyman. with a-list stars such as Richard Egan, Karl malden, Nancy Olsen, Agnes moorehead and countless others, it's an excellently written and direct film from start to finish. while the film runs well over the two hour mark, one doesn't notice as it is well-paced. when the film was released, many male viewing audiences were not interested as they felt the story line was geared more towards women and young girls. there is a lot to like here as the films touches on the many different lives of the towns habitants and how Pollyanna changed them through her charm and presence. she is not one to be deterred or stopped in her tracks by someone who is a grouchy hermit such as Mr. pendergas or Agnes moorehead's character who is chronically ill and forever in her nightgown and bed. somehow, Pollyanna is able to add some sunshine and life into their dreary existence. i especially enjoyed the scenes where the town has a carnival and everyone participates and for once without the rule of aunt Polly, begin to experience the joy and happiness of the good things in life. over-all i suggest everyone see this film at least once. you won't regret it.

    To really appreciate this film, imagine Shirley Temple as Pollyanna. Temple was extraordinarily talented, but her cherubic qualities guaranteed that her Rebecca (of Sunnybrook Farm) would be the cinematic equivalent of a Hallmark card. Rebecca and Pollyanna were similar characters in very different plots (though both were orphans), but Hayley Mills as Pollyanna never even tries to be adorable. In fact, quite the opposite. She's a lanky young girl with pigtails and knock-knees, and she never delivers a saccharine line or maudlin moment. In the course of the movie, she leads a variety of sour adults-- a recluse (Menjou), a crosspatch (Moorehead), a minister (Malden), a curmudgeon (Ian Wolfe), a maid (Mary Grace Canfield), and a spinster aunt (Wyman)-- toward a better humor. At no point is she a cheerleader; indeed, she mostly just asks them questions, showing interest in them, interest that they return, and her good humor gets them to reconsider their grim outlooks. It's simplistic, of course, and even ridiculous (the town seems to have more orphans than citizens). But that is where subtlety comes to the rescue, and craftsmanship. It's a well-made film, particularly in terms of art direction and costumes which were clearly designed with Technicolor in mind. The direction and photography are uninspired, but no great creativity was required because characters and story are the whole point, and the screenplay has elements sophisticated enough for any critic. The early anecdote about crutches foreshadow the climax in just the right way, for instance. Even better is a lovely metaphor about prisms, when Pollyanna enters the home of the recluse who has (don't ask) an endless quantity of lamp prisms in his cluttered mansion. Playing with the prisms, she charms Menjou and later Moorehead, and moviegoers, for whom the prisms are a colorful visual symbol of cheerier points of view. The real subtlety, though, is in the performances. Malden plays his fire-and-brimstone minister to the hilt, and Donald Crisp is a stoutly impassioned mayor. But most of Pollyanna's converts, particularly Wyman and Menjou, deliver quietly supportive, reflective performances. In spite of a story in which the adults are barely believable caricatures, this film was so solidly constructed and underplayed that the children's-book aspect is overwhelmed by the genuinely delightful message, and a marvelously realistic performance by Hayley Mills.

    Considering that Pollyanna was his debut, writer and director David Swift does a very good job here. Pollyanna does have its faults, but it is a solid adaptation of a charming book. Where Pollyanna isn't so strong is in the length and the pacing. At over 2 hours, the film is a little too long, while the film does move fairly slowly. My final flaw is that twenty minutes or so before the end, the tone changes and this change was somewhat jarring. Nonetheless, Pollyanna is exquisitely filmed with stunning cinematography, costumes and scenery, and the music is lovely. The script is well written and the story still has its charm. The direction is as solid as the film itself, while the acting is very good. Hayley Mills gives a spirited performance in the title role, while Agnes Moorehead comes very close to stealing the film. Karl Malden, Jane Wyman and Adolphe Menjou also do great turns as the cheerless citizens whose lives are transformed by Pollyanna. Overall, has its faults but it is a solid and charming film. 7/10 Bethany Cox

    Meredith Wilson's "The Music Man" is really "Pollyanna" with tunes. Professor Hill comes into a small town and changes the lives of the inhabitants for the better in much the same way as Pollyanna herself does.His preference for the "Sadder but wiser girl" would have been satisfied by Miss Nancy Olson and you can easily imagine the townswomen doing "Pick a little-talk a little". About the time this movie was released, Mr Robert Preston was scoring a personal triumph in Wilson's show.By the same token,"Pollyanna" is a personal triumph for Miss Hayley Mills,as much a surprise choice for the part as Vivien Leigh had been for Scarlett O'Hara a generation earlier. Veteran Mr Adolphe Menjou runs her close with a performance that is the sum of everything he had learned in his distinguished career.I found it very moving,a last hurrah worthy of a fine,sensitive actor. "Pollyanna" is not a children's movie,it is however a movie about children told with an innocent eye. Whilst Hayley Mills went on to have a long and successful career - indeed she is still appearing on TV in 2009 - malign fate had a far different destiny waiting for another little girl of her age who was an extra in the movie. The tragic Stephanie Lynn Gorman who can be seen to Hayley's right on the bandstand when she sings "America the beautiful",was raped and murdered at her home in L.A.aged 15.Her killer has never been caught. God rest her soul.

    "Pollyanna" is one of the best films I have seen lately. As in "The Parent Trap," Hayley Mills does an amazing job with her appealing role, for which she won a special Academy Award. Mills plays Pollyanna, an orphan child who comes to a small town to live with her Aunt Polly and ends up reforming and changing the lives of the people of the town. It may sound predictable, and to a point it is, but it is the way in which the story is presented that makes it so good. So many of the scenes in this film are so well done, including Pollyanna bringing joy to a crabby old woman dying in bed, causing the local reverend (Karl Malden) to look for the good in people, and changing the attitudes of the servants in her own household. Consider who these people are at the beginning of the film and who they are by the end and you're bound to find this movie very moving. I admit that I was worried about how this film would end. It looked like it was going to be depressing after all we had been hoping for. Nevertheless, the ending scene is one of the most brilliant I have ever seen, and without giving it away, I have to warn you that it will touch you and bring tears to your eyes no matter who you are. What a great film that touches and inspires. One of Disney's all-time best live action movies. ***1/2 out of ****
