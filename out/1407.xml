    The Specialist is not a great movie. Don't mistake my 8 for this being a cinematic masterpiece. But as one of the all time great Stallone fans I found this indubitably entertaining. It has a masterful performance of a villain (James Woods), a ton of ridiculous campy one liners, an equally campy and gratuitous red light sex scene that tries to channel 9 1/2 Weeks and Stallone being...Stallone. It was ridiculously campy and perfectly entertaining. Anyone that goes into this expecting any more than what it provides went in with ridiculous expectations. It has plenty of action, a ton of explosions, an appropriately cheesy 80's-esque storyline and the first 20 minutes is Stallone doing what he does best. The scene of him on the bus busting hooligans heads so that a woman can have a bus seat...random and awesome all at once. On the surface and by all accounts it really a terrible movie but look at it from a sheer fun and cheese factor. I don't think I had ever watched it before and it was just completely entertaining. If you love Sylvester Stallone like I do then you know what to expect from him. In The Specialist he is a quiet brooding explosions expert who becomes obsessed with his latest client. Stallone grunts and says a few one liners and kills people the way we love him to do. He is good in the role and while it doesn't stretch his acting ability by any means, it was a good role for him. Sharon Stone...man is she awful. I don't recall seeing her in anything where she impressed me. She was certainly sexy in this but her melodramatic performance is laughable. The chemistry with her and Stallone is pretty good...I actually think they're one random completely gratuitous sex scene was at least almost hot. She is definitely one of the weaker points of this film but she pulls off the role just barely. James Woods might be the number one reason to watch this movie. This isn't a new role for him, in fact I felt like I'd seen him do this before but he was great at it. He plays a maniacal former CIA operative and bomb expert who is now working private security for a mobster. He is ruthless, fast talking and downright evil. He is brilliant in this role!! He is the perfect adversary for Stallone. Eric Roberts has a small role as the sleazy son of the mob boss. Roberts is good...he plays sleazy well and the best scenes are his interactions with Woods but he is mostly expendable (no pun I swear) and doesn't make a big impression. The legendary Rod Steiger is the mob boss himself. Steiger doesn't have a huge role but he has some solid scenes (again the best of which are opposite Woods) but something about him and his charisma commands attention on screen. Director Luis Llosa isn't exactly a household name. He has had some okay films under his belt including Anaconda and Sniper and has worked with some big names with those films and this one. He seems content to stay in the realm of average. I think he probably let Stallone, Woods and Stone do what they do best and let the story unfold. The story is actually very good and was actually considered one of the best scripts in circulation in Hollywood before it was made. It has lots of twists and turns and enough explosions to keep any action fan happy. Its a drama, its a romance, its a baby-blue type erotic thriller, and its an action flick. If you don't see it for what it is then you will certainly be disappointed. Nothing about it is amazing (with the exception of maybe Woods) but everything about it is entertaining. It was a good time and it thoroughly filled my Stallone quota so for that reason I am scoring it a solid 8. Might seem ridiculous to some but I am voting strictly on entertainment value and I go with my gut!! 8/10

    Â„The Specialist" doesn't work as either thriller (because there are no REAL plot twists) or as a action movie (because there is no REAL action) . The whole movie just doesn't have much to offer to a viewer . Stallone is miscast in the title role . It's just unbelievable for me that someone as strong as Stallone would be also an expert when it comes to bombs . The role should be played be someone with more intellectual look . There is no real reason for Stallone to play that part . There are only two fight scenes and they hardly anything spectacular ( not too mention that the second one was forced into the movie probably because of fear that audience will die of boredom) . Stallone doesn't got anything to do in terms of action and acting , so it's no surprise that he gives a bad performance. He's lost as the whole movie. Sharon Stone looks great and actually gives a nice performance . Along with "Casino" and "Basic instinct" this is her best performance . She's both sexy and vulnerable. James Woods gives a typical James Woods performance . He's a lovely asshole in this one. It was good to see Eric Roberts in small , but nice part. The director Luis Llosa rather awfully directs the whole movie . The pacing is flat and the whole movie lacks tension . It just drags the whole time from beginning to the end. The screenplay is also unimpressive since audience is able to see the so-called "twists" long before they appear. Is there anything good about this movie ? I actually REALLY enjoyed the romance between Stallone and Stone . There is undeniable sexual tension between them . I also enjoyed the sex scene (against popular opinion). And there is plenty of nice looking explosions. I give it 3/10.

    Somehow I missed this film in first release, which is so surprising because the themes are very similar to my favorite action/romance film, Tequila Sunrise, which was released six years earlier. Here we see Sly, Sharon, James and Eric at the height of their physical beauty, and the acting's not that bad either. If you are a fan of action films and appreciate that back in the 80s and 90s we used to get a little gratuitous sex along with our violence, then this film is for you. Okay, Spoiler Alert: the denouement is a soft porn shower scene. I especially appreciate Sly's flank as he rolls over Sharon. supine on the shower floor. Delicious. Enjoy!

    "The Specialist" is probably not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it is surprisingly bland for a Stallone flick. Everyone involved just seems to be sleepwalking through it, which is the last thing you want to see in an action flick. Director Luis Llosa (of "Anaconda"...fame?) probably can't do much better than this, but I've never seen Sly look so bored throughout a movie. Same with Eric Roberts, usually his bad guy schtick is pretty entertaining but this performance is just totally phoned in. Particularly the first half of "The Specialist" drags like crazy, the only thing that kept me awake there is Sharon Stone's intense hatred for bras. In the second half the movie does manage to pick up the pace, but there's no tension whatsoever because you know exactly how it will end. Everyone who watches the first ten minutes of this thing knows that the climax is going to be James Woods talking for way too long and then getting killed, so why take so damn long to get there? It's not all bad though, because in the end "The Specialist" shows us the most unconvicing movie kiss I've ever seen. It almost makes everything worth it. Almost.

    Stallone never could act at all but he comes off pretty well in this trashily risible flick alongside a hammy and ancient-looking Rod Steiger, a truly dreadful Eric Roberts, and the King of Hammy Overacting himself James Woods. However Sharon Stone is badly miscast as May Munro. Stone was never much of an actress and she only became famous by taking all her clothes off for a very exploitative piece of garbage called "Basic Instinct", when she was already in her mid-thirties. In this film she was 36, yet we are supposed to believe that as a child she witnessed her parents get killed by Eric Roberts. That is just laughable, when Stone and Roberts are clearly the same age. It would have been more believable if Woods had played the Roberts role. It's hard to believe this movie had a cinema release. Nowadays it would just go straight to DVD. 0/10.

    The filmmakers spent a lot on this movie. Big names: Stallone, Stone, Roberts (Eric), Steiger and Woods. The score is by John Barry, Emilio Estefan Jr was involved and appears in the film. A huge number of people were involved behind the scenes too. So do we get end product? No. Stallone goes through the motions Â– the illogical and unnecessary violence, the contrived stunts, the flat delivery and the lack of facial expression. Stone looks gorgeous and waits for some interesting dialogue to be delivered to her. It doesn't come. Roberts looks angry in every scene Â– presumably with his agent. Woods gives it some effort but he's got nothing to work with. Steiger is almost unrecognisable. If I tell you that I saw this on a satellite channel, and I actually looked forward to the adverts, you'll get some idea of just how bad this is. And the only thing steamy in the shower scene is the steam. This film well deserved its Razzie awards: worst actress (Stone) and worst screen couple (Stallone/Stone) Should have also won (but was only nominated for) worst actor (Stallone), worst supporting actor (Steiger) and, finally, worst picture. Everyone involved with this should be embarrassed, and that's a lot of people. I'll give it two stars cos I still like Sharon Stone. She just made a huge mistake on this one.

    THE SPECIALIST I love cheesy action movies... especially those from the 80s and 90s. And let's face it... the royalty of action movies has to be Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone. I had seen The Specialist a long time ago, but I didn't remember much about it... apart from the most famous scene in the movie. I really enjoyed it... it was good action and also a good thriller too. This was made when Sylvester Stallone was in his prime in my opinion. He made some classic films in the 90s. One of my favourite movies of the 90s is Demolition Man. This is not one of his best movies, but it is still a very good one. In case you don't remember it, the story is about a guy who is a trained killer hired by the government who goes into retirement after an innocent person gets killed by mistake. He gets hired by a lady who saw her parents get murdered when she was a little girl, to kill the guy who killed her parents. He is the son of a mafia boss. The problem is, Stallones old boss now works for the mafia. The acting is pretty much what you would expect from a cheesy action film. It's alright but some of it is comical. Sharon Stone plays the lady that hired him and she does a great job in this. But then back in the day I liked her as an actress. She has made some great films. Eric Roberts plays the guy that Stallone is after. Eric is really good at playing a bad guy... although I think he was really good in Best of the Best. He has been is so many big movies, yet doesn't seem to get the recognition he deserves. Rod Steiger plays the mafia boss... he is funny. His accent just sounds so fake that every time he spoke I smiled. J I will give this film a 7 out of 10. I really liked it, but Stallone has made better.

    It's pretty simple really, this is an appalling film, honestly just awful. But like so many other films that have virtually nothing going for them somehow it kept me watching. There are 3 caveats to that statement - firstly, it was on TV so I hadn't wasted any cash renting it out, secondly I didn't actually make it to the end, but if it hadn't been for an inconveniently placed ad break i'd probably have watched on, and thirdly I am mentally ill (or at least I must be for staying up late to watch this). I don't know if this is due to my snazzy new TV but somehow it looked like it had been filmed on an HD home video camera. Perhaps the extra clarity of the screen just served to expose the awfulness of the cinematography. There were scenes, particularly one in a bar, that looked like they could have been straight out of Home & Away. Strangely though it wasn't even an HD broadcast, so it could really be that this film is, after all, that bad. Anyway, there's not a huge amount to add to what has already been said, Stallone is just Stallone, as is Roberts (as in he's Roberts, not Stallone.. if you see what I mean). Steiger (head of the Leon family) is about as menacing as my mum. Woods hams it up quite well all things considered. Stone is awful, but in this company looks like she should be up for an Oscar, as should the loud shirt that is the recipient of the best line in the film when Woods comes out of a lift (you'll have to watch it just for that). It's worth watching because it is sooooo bad, and you will laugh out loud many, many times, so on that basis I recommend this movie wholeheartedly (but still can't bring myself to give it more than 3/10).

    I have seen this movie back in 1994 or 1995 when it came out. Frankly, I did not have any memory regarding this one at all and along came the opportunity to watch it again and I got to say, this is one of the worst movie experiences I've had in a long time. First of all, the movie is the typical clich&eacute; type story with two buddies becoming enemies. Then the movie is moving so slowly, it is hard to watch. Along with the completely displaced John Barry score, the movie creators obviously tried to go for something more artistic in an action movie, but they failed miserably. However, the action is missing. Just a few predictable and unspectacular explosions. The characters are all annoying and not even the main character played by Stallone receives my sympathy. Don't watch it. It is a complete waste of time. More importantly, if you have watched it already, don't watch it again.

    Full of entertainment. Nicely paced with minimum of dialogues and full of action. The muscles of Sly and beauty of Stone work well. But for me James Wood is simply superb and somewhat stole the show with witty performance. Sly is as usual as is Sharon Stone, however Eric Roberts did justice to his role. Plot was almost non existent but you don't need it in such a fast movie. And yes, don't miss the opening shot of Sly and Wood. It is vary good The fight scene in the bus with Sly saying "I hate knives" was a good piece of direction. Don't miss it just sit back and enjoy. You might want to see it one more time, maybe.

In case you don't remember it, the story is about a guy who is a trained killer hired by the government who goes into retirement after an innocent person gets killed by mistake. He gets hired by a lady who saw her parents get murdered when she was a little girl, to kill the guy who killed her parents. He is the son of a mafia boss. The problem is, Stallones old boss now works for the mafia. The acting is pretty much what you would expect from a cheesy action film. It's alright but some of it is comical. Sharon Stone plays the lady that hired him and she does a great job in this. But then back in the day I liked her as an actress. She has made some great films. Eric Roberts plays the guy that Stallone is after. Eric is really good at playing a bad guy... although I think he was really good in Best of the Best. He has been is so many big movies, yet doesn't seem to get the recognition he deserves. Rod Steiger plays the mafia boss... he is funny. His accent just sounds so fake that every time he spoke I smiled. J I will give this film a 7 out of 10. I really liked it, but Stallone has made better.

    It's pretty simple really, this is an appalling film, honestly just awful. But like so many other films that have virtually nothing going for them somehow it kept me watching. There are 3 caveats to that statement - firstly, it was on TV so I hadn't wasted any cash renting it out, secondly I didn't actually make it to the end, but if it hadn't been for an inconveniently placed ad break i'd probably have watched on, and thirdly I am mentally ill (or at least I must be for staying up late to watch this). I don't know if this is due to my snazzy new TV but somehow it looked like it had been filmed on an HD home video camera. Perhaps the extra clarity of the screen just served to expose the awfulness of the cinematography. There were scenes, particularly one in a bar, that looked like they could have been straight out of Home & Away. Strangely though it wasn't even an HD broadcast, so it could really be that this film is, after all, that bad. Anyway, there's not a huge amount to add to what has already been said, Stallone is just Stallone, as is Roberts (as in he's Roberts, not Stallone.. if you see what I mean). Steiger (head of the Leon family) is about as menacing as my mum. Woods hams it up quite well all things considered. Stone is awful, but in this company looks like she should be up for an Oscar, as should the loud shirt that is the recipient of the best line in the film when Woods comes out of a lift (you'll have to watch it just for that). It's worth watching because it is sooooo bad, and you will laugh out loud many, many times, so on that basis I recommend this movie wholeheartedly (but still can't bring myself to give it more than 3/10).

    I have seen this movie back in 1994 or 1995 when it came out. Frankly, I did not have any memory regarding this one at all and along came the opportunity to watch it again and I got to say, this is one of the worst movie experiences I've had in a long time. First of all, the movie is the typical clich&eacute; type story with two buddies becoming enemies. Then the movie is moving so slowly, it is hard to watch. Along with the completely displaced John Barry score, the movie creators obviously tried to go for something more artistic in an action movie, but they failed miserably. However, the action is missing. Just a few predictable and unspectacular explosions. The characters are all annoying and not even the main character played by Stallone receives my sympathy. Don't watch it. It is a complete waste of time. More importantly, if you have watched it already, don't watch it again.

    Full of entertainment. Nicely paced with minimum of dialogues and full of action. The muscles of Sly and beauty of Stone work well. But for me James Wood is simply superb and somewhat stole the show with witty performance. Sly is as usual as is Sharon Stone, however Eric Roberts did justice to his role. Plot was almost non existent but you don't need it in such a fast movie. And yes, don't miss the opening shot of Sly and Wood. It is vary good The fight scene in the bus with Sly saying "I hate knives" was a good piece of direction. Don't miss it just sit back and enjoy. You might want to see it one more time, maybe.

    The Specialist is not a great movie. Don't mistake my 8 for this being a cinematic masterpiece. But as one of the all time great Stallone fans I found this indubitably entertaining. It has a masterful performance of a villain (James Woods), a ton of ridiculous campy one liners, an equally campy and gratuitous red light sex scene that tries to channel 9 1/2 Weeks and Stallone being...Stallone. It was ridiculously campy and perfectly entertaining. Anyone that goes into this expecting any more than what it provides went in with ridiculous expectations. It has plenty of action, a ton of explosions, an appropriately cheesy 80's-esque storyline and the first 20 minutes is Stallone doing what he does best. The scene of him on the bus busting hooligans heads so that a woman can have a bus seat...random and awesome all at once. On the surface and by all accounts it really a terrible movie but look at it from a sheer fun and cheese factor. I don't think I had ever watched it before and it was just completely entertaining. If you love Sylvester Stallone like I do then you know what to expect from him. In The Specialist he is a quiet brooding explosions expert who becomes obsessed with his latest client. Stallone grunts and says a few one liners and kills people the way we love him to do. He is good in the role and while it doesn't stretch his acting ability by any means, it was a good role for him. Sharon Stone...man is she awful. I don't recall seeing her in anything where she impressed me. She was certainly sexy in this but her melodramatic performance is laughable. The chemistry with her and Stallone is pretty good...I actually think they're one random completely gratuitous sex scene was at least almost hot. She is definitely one of the weaker points of this film but she pulls off the role just barely. James Woods might be the number one reason to watch this movie. This isn't a new role for him, in fact I felt like I'd seen him do this before but he was great at it. He plays a maniacal former CIA operative and bomb expert who is now working private security for a mobster. He is ruthless, fast talking and downright evil. He is brilliant in this role!! He is the perfect adversary for Stallone. Eric Roberts has a small role as the sleazy son of the mob boss. Roberts is good...he plays sleazy well and the best scenes are his interactions with Woods but he is mostly expendable (no pun I swear) and doesn't make a big impression. The legendary Rod Steiger is the mob boss himself. Steiger doesn't have a huge role but he has some solid scenes (again the best of which are opposite Woods) but something about him and his charisma commands attention on screen. Director Luis Llosa isn't exactly a household name. He has had some okay films under his belt including Anaconda and Sniper and has worked with some big names with those films and this one. He seems content to stay in the realm of average. I think he probably let Stallone, Woods and Stone do what they do best and let the story unfold. The story is actually very good and was actually considered one of the best scripts in circulation in Hollywood before it was made. It has lots of twists and turns and enough explosions to keep any action fan happy. Its a drama, its a romance, its a baby-blue type erotic thriller, and its an action flick. If you don't see it for what it is then you will certainly be disappointed. Nothing about it is amazing (with the exception of maybe Woods) but everything about it is entertaining. It was a good time and it thoroughly filled my Stallone quota so for that reason I am scoring it a solid 8. Might seem ridiculous to some but I am voting strictly on entertainment value and I go with my gut!! 8/10

    Â„The Specialist" doesn't work as either thriller (because there are no REAL plot twists) or as a action movie (because there is no REAL action) . The whole movie just doesn't have much to offer to a viewer . Stallone is miscast in the title role . It's just unbelievable for me that someone as strong as Stallone would be also an expert when it comes to bombs . The role should be played be someone with more intellectual look . There is no real reason for Stallone to play that part . There are only two fight scenes and they hardly anything spectacular ( not too mention that the second one was forced into the movie probably because of fear that audience will die of boredom) . Stallone doesn't got anything to do in terms of action and acting , so it's no surprise that he gives a bad performance. He's lost as the whole movie. Sharon Stone looks great and actually gives a nice performance . Along with "Casino" and "Basic instinct" this is her best performance . She's both sexy and vulnerable. James Woods gives a typical James Woods performance . He's a lovely asshole in this one. It was good to see Eric Roberts in small , but nice part. The director Luis Llosa rather awfully directs the whole movie . The pacing is flat and the whole movie lacks tension . It just drags the whole time from beginning to the end. The screenplay is also unimpressive since audience is able to see the so-called "twists" long before they appear. Is there anything good about this movie ? I actually REALLY enjoyed the romance between Stallone and Stone . There is undeniable sexual tension between them . I also enjoyed the sex scene (against popular opinion). And there is plenty of nice looking explosions. I give it 3/10.

    Somehow I missed this film in first release, which is so surprising because the themes are very similar to my favorite action/romance film, Tequila Sunrise, which was released six years earlier. Here we see Sly, Sharon, James and Eric at the height of their physical beauty, and the acting's not that bad either. If you are a fan of action films and appreciate that back in the 80s and 90s we used to get a little gratuitous sex along with our violence, then this film is for you. Okay, Spoiler Alert: the denouement is a soft porn shower scene. I especially appreciate Sly's flank as he rolls over Sharon. supine on the shower floor. Delicious. Enjoy!

    "The Specialist" is probably not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it is surprisingly bland for a Stallone flick. Everyone involved just seems to be sleepwalking through it, which is the last thing you want to see in an action flick. Director Luis Llosa (of "Anaconda"...fame?) probably can't do much better than this, but I've never seen Sly look so bored throughout a movie. Same with Eric Roberts, usually his bad guy schtick is pretty entertaining but this performance is just totally phoned in. Particularly the first half of "The Specialist" drags like crazy, the only thing that kept me awake there is Sharon Stone's intense hatred for bras. In the second half the movie does manage to pick up the pace, but there's no tension whatsoever because you know exactly how it will end. Everyone who watches the first ten minutes of this thing knows that the climax is going to be James Woods talking for way too long and then getting killed, so why take so damn long to get there? It's not all bad though, because in the end "The Specialist" shows us the most unconvicing movie kiss I've ever seen. It almost makes everything worth it. Almost.

    Stallone never could act at all but he comes off pretty well in this trashily risible flick alongside a hammy and ancient-looking Rod Steiger, a truly dreadful Eric Roberts, and the King of Hammy Overacting himself James Woods. However Sharon Stone is badly miscast as May Munro. Stone was never much of an actress and she only became famous by taking all her clothes off for a very exploitative piece of garbage called "Basic Instinct", when she was already in her mid-thirties. In this film she was 36, yet we are supposed to believe that as a child she witnessed her parents get killed by Eric Roberts. That is just laughable, when Stone and Roberts are clearly the same age. It would have been more believable if Woods had played the Roberts role. It's hard to believe this movie had a cinema release. Nowadays it would just go straight to DVD. 0/10.

    The filmmakers spent a lot on this movie. Big names: Stallone, Stone, Roberts (Eric), Steiger and Woods. The score is by John Barry, Emilio Estefan Jr was involved and appears in the film. A huge number of people were involved behind the scenes too. So do we get end product? No. Stallone goes through the motions Â– the illogical and unnecessary violence, the contrived stunts, the flat delivery and the lack of facial expression. Stone looks gorgeous and waits for some interesting dialogue to be delivered to her. It doesn't come. Roberts looks angry in every scene Â– presumably with his agent. Woods gives it some effort but he's got nothing to work with. Steiger is almost unrecognisable. If I tell you that I saw this on a satellite channel, and I actually looked forward to the adverts, you'll get some idea of just how bad this is. And the only thing steamy in the shower scene is the steam. This film well deserved its Razzie awards: worst actress (Stone) and worst screen couple (Stallone/Stone) Should have also won (but was only nominated for) worst actor (Stallone), worst supporting actor (Steiger) and, finally, worst picture. Everyone involved with this should be embarrassed, and that's a lot of people. I'll give it two stars cos I still like Sharon Stone. She just made a huge mistake on this one.

    THE SPECIALIST I love cheesy action movies... especially those from the 80s and 90s. And let's face it... the royalty of action movies has to be Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone. I had seen The Specialist a long time ago, but I didn't remember much about it... apart from the most famous scene in the movie. I really enjoyed it... it was good action and also a good thriller too. This was made when Sylvester Stallone was in his prime in my opinion. He made some classic films in the 90s. One of my favourite movies of the 90s is Demolition Man. This is not one of his best movies, but it is still a very good one.

    Stallone never could act at all but he comes off pretty well in this trashily risible flick alongside a hammy and ancient-looking Rod Steiger, a truly dreadful Eric Roberts, and the King of Hammy Overacting himself James Woods. However Sharon Stone is badly miscast as May Munro. Stone was never much of an actress and she only became famous by taking all her clothes off for a very exploitative piece of garbage called "Basic Instinct", when she was already in her mid-thirties. In this film she was 36, yet we are supposed to believe that as a child she witnessed her parents get killed by Eric Roberts. That is just laughable, when Stone and Roberts are clearly the same age. It would have been more believable if Woods had played the Roberts role. It's hard to believe this movie had a cinema release. Nowadays it would just go straight to DVD. 0/10.

    The filmmakers spent a lot on this movie. Big names: Stallone, Stone, Roberts (Eric), Steiger and Woods. The score is by John Barry, Emilio Estefan Jr was involved and appears in the film. A huge number of people were involved behind the scenes too. So do we get end product? No. Stallone goes through the motions Â– the illogical and unnecessary violence, the contrived stunts, the flat delivery and the lack of facial expression. Stone looks gorgeous and waits for some interesting dialogue to be delivered to her. It doesn't come. Roberts looks angry in every scene Â– presumably with his agent. Woods gives it some effort but he's got nothing to work with. Steiger is almost unrecognisable. If I tell you that I saw this on a satellite channel, and I actually looked forward to the adverts, you'll get some idea of just how bad this is. And the only thing steamy in the shower scene is the steam. This film well deserved its Razzie awards: worst actress (Stone) and worst screen couple (Stallone/Stone) Should have also won (but was only nominated for) worst actor (Stallone), worst supporting actor (Steiger) and, finally, worst picture. Everyone involved with this should be embarrassed, and that's a lot of people. I'll give it two stars cos I still like Sharon Stone. She just made a huge mistake on this one.

    THE SPECIALIST I love cheesy action movies... especially those from the 80s and 90s. And let's face it... the royalty of action movies has to be Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone. I had seen The Specialist a long time ago, but I didn't remember much about it... apart from the most famous scene in the movie. I really enjoyed it... it was good action and also a good thriller too. This was made when Sylvester Stallone was in his prime in my opinion. He made some classic films in the 90s. One of my favourite movies of the 90s is Demolition Man. This is not one of his best movies, but it is still a very good one. In case you don't remember it, the story is about a guy who is a trained killer hired by the government who goes into retirement after an innocent person gets killed by mistake. He gets hired by a lady who saw her parents get murdered when she was a little girl, to kill the guy who killed her parents. He is the son of a mafia boss. The problem is, Stallones old boss now works for the mafia. The acting is pretty much what you would expect from a cheesy action film. It's alright but some of it is comical. Sharon Stone plays the lady that hired him and she does a great job in this. But then back in the day I liked her as an actress. She has made some great films. Eric Roberts plays the guy that Stallone is after. Eric is really good at playing a bad guy... although I think he was really good in Best of the Best. He has been is so many big movies, yet doesn't seem to get the recognition he deserves. Rod Steiger plays the mafia boss... he is funny. His accent just sounds so fake that every time he spoke I smiled. J I will give this film a 7 out of 10. I really liked it, but Stallone has made better.

    It's pretty simple really, this is an appalling film, honestly just awful. But like so many other films that have virtually nothing going for them somehow it kept me watching. There are 3 caveats to that statement - firstly, it was on TV so I hadn't wasted any cash renting it out, secondly I didn't actually make it to the end, but if it hadn't been for an inconveniently placed ad break i'd probably have watched on, and thirdly I am mentally ill (or at least I must be for staying up late to watch this). I don't know if this is due to my snazzy new TV but somehow it looked like it had been filmed on an HD home video camera. Perhaps the extra clarity of the screen just served to expose the awfulness of the cinematography. There were scenes, particularly one in a bar, that looked like they could have been straight out of Home & Away. Strangely though it wasn't even an HD broadcast, so it could really be that this film is, after all, that bad. Anyway, there's not a huge amount to add to what has already been said, Stallone is just Stallone, as is Roberts (as in he's Roberts, not Stallone.. if you see what I mean). Steiger (head of the Leon family) is about as menacing as my mum. Woods hams it up quite well all things considered. Stone is awful, but in this company looks like she should be up for an Oscar, as should the loud shirt that is the recipient of the best line in the film when Woods comes out of a lift (you'll have to watch it just for that). It's worth watching because it is sooooo bad, and you will laugh out loud many, many times, so on that basis I recommend this movie wholeheartedly (but still can't bring myself to give it more than 3/10).

    I have seen this movie back in 1994 or 1995 when it came out. Frankly, I did not have any memory regarding this one at all and along came the opportunity to watch it again and I got to say, this is one of the worst movie experiences I've had in a long time. First of all, the movie is the typical clich&eacute; type story with two buddies becoming enemies. Then the movie is moving so slowly, it is hard to watch. Along with the completely displaced John Barry score, the movie creators obviously tried to go for something more artistic in an action movie, but they failed miserably. However, the action is missing. Just a few predictable and unspectacular explosions. The characters are all annoying and not even the main character played by Stallone receives my sympathy. Don't watch it. It is a complete waste of time. More importantly, if you have watched it already, don't watch it again.

    Full of entertainment. Nicely paced with minimum of dialogues and full of action. The muscles of Sly and beauty of Stone work well. But for me James Wood is simply superb and somewhat stole the show with witty performance. Sly is as usual as is Sharon Stone, however Eric Roberts did justice to his role. Plot was almost non existent but you don't need it in such a fast movie. And yes, don't miss the opening shot of Sly and Wood. It is vary good The fight scene in the bus with Sly saying "I hate knives" was a good piece of direction. Don't miss it just sit back and enjoy. You might want to see it one more time, maybe.

    The Specialist is not a great movie. Don't mistake my 8 for this being a cinematic masterpiece. But as one of the all time great Stallone fans I found this indubitably entertaining. It has a masterful performance of a villain (James Woods), a ton of ridiculous campy one liners, an equally campy and gratuitous red light sex scene that tries to channel 9 1/2 Weeks and Stallone being...Stallone. It was ridiculously campy and perfectly entertaining. Anyone that goes into this expecting any more than what it provides went in with ridiculous expectations. It has plenty of action, a ton of explosions, an appropriately cheesy 80's-esque storyline and the first 20 minutes is Stallone doing what he does best. The scene of him on the bus busting hooligans heads so that a woman can have a bus seat...random and awesome all at once. On the surface and by all accounts it really a terrible movie but look at it from a sheer fun and cheese factor. I don't think I had ever watched it before and it was just completely entertaining. If you love Sylvester Stallone like I do then you know what to expect from him. In The Specialist he is a quiet brooding explosions expert who becomes obsessed with his latest client. Stallone grunts and says a few one liners and kills people the way we love him to do. He is good in the role and while it doesn't stretch his acting ability by any means, it was a good role for him. Sharon Stone...man is she awful. I don't recall seeing her in anything where she impressed me. She was certainly sexy in this but her melodramatic performance is laughable. The chemistry with her and Stallone is pretty good...I actually think they're one random completely gratuitous sex scene was at least almost hot. She is definitely one of the weaker points of this film but she pulls off the role just barely. James Woods might be the number one reason to watch this movie. This isn't a new role for him, in fact I felt like I'd seen him do this before but he was great at it. He plays a maniacal former CIA operative and bomb expert who is now working private security for a mobster. He is ruthless, fast talking and downright evil. He is brilliant in this role!! He is the perfect adversary for Stallone. Eric Roberts has a small role as the sleazy son of the mob boss. Roberts is good...he plays sleazy well and the best scenes are his interactions with Woods but he is mostly expendable (no pun I swear) and doesn't make a big impression. The legendary Rod Steiger is the mob boss himself. Steiger doesn't have a huge role but he has some solid scenes (again the best of which are opposite Woods) but something about him and his charisma commands attention on screen. Director Luis Llosa isn't exactly a household name. He has had some okay films under his belt including Anaconda and Sniper and has worked with some big names with those films and this one. He seems content to stay in the realm of average. I think he probably let Stallone, Woods and Stone do what they do best and let the story unfold. The story is actually very good and was actually considered one of the best scripts in circulation in Hollywood before it was made. It has lots of twists and turns and enough explosions to keep any action fan happy. Its a drama, its a romance, its a baby-blue type erotic thriller, and its an action flick. If you don't see it for what it is then you will certainly be disappointed. Nothing about it is amazing (with the exception of maybe Woods) but everything about it is entertaining. It was a good time and it thoroughly filled my Stallone quota so for that reason I am scoring it a solid 8. Might seem ridiculous to some but I am voting strictly on entertainment value and I go with my gut!! 8/10

    Â„The Specialist" doesn't work as either thriller (because there are no REAL plot twists) or as a action movie (because there is no REAL action) . The whole movie just doesn't have much to offer to a viewer . Stallone is miscast in the title role . It's just unbelievable for me that someone as strong as Stallone would be also an expert when it comes to bombs . The role should be played be someone with more intellectual look . There is no real reason for Stallone to play that part . There are only two fight scenes and they hardly anything spectacular ( not too mention that the second one was forced into the movie probably because of fear that audience will die of boredom) . Stallone doesn't got anything to do in terms of action and acting , so it's no surprise that he gives a bad performance. He's lost as the whole movie. Sharon Stone looks great and actually gives a nice performance . Along with "Casino" and "Basic instinct" this is her best performance . She's both sexy and vulnerable. James Woods gives a typical James Woods performance . He's a lovely asshole in this one. It was good to see Eric Roberts in small , but nice part. The director Luis Llosa rather awfully directs the whole movie . The pacing is flat and the whole movie lacks tension . It just drags the whole time from beginning to the end. The screenplay is also unimpressive since audience is able to see the so-called "twists" long before they appear. Is there anything good about this movie ? I actually REALLY enjoyed the romance between Stallone and Stone . There is undeniable sexual tension between them . I also enjoyed the sex scene (against popular opinion). And there is plenty of nice looking explosions. I give it 3/10.

    Somehow I missed this film in first release, which is so surprising because the themes are very similar to my favorite action/romance film, Tequila Sunrise, which was released six years earlier. Here we see Sly, Sharon, James and Eric at the height of their physical beauty, and the acting's not that bad either. If you are a fan of action films and appreciate that back in the 80s and 90s we used to get a little gratuitous sex along with our violence, then this film is for you. Okay, Spoiler Alert: the denouement is a soft porn shower scene. I especially appreciate Sly's flank as he rolls over Sharon. supine on the shower floor. Delicious. Enjoy!

    "The Specialist" is probably not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it is surprisingly bland for a Stallone flick. Everyone involved just seems to be sleepwalking through it, which is the last thing you want to see in an action flick. Director Luis Llosa (of "Anaconda"...fame?) probably can't do much better than this, but I've never seen Sly look so bored throughout a movie. Same with Eric Roberts, usually his bad guy schtick is pretty entertaining but this performance is just totally phoned in. Particularly the first half of "The Specialist" drags like crazy, the only thing that kept me awake there is Sharon Stone's intense hatred for bras. In the second half the movie does manage to pick up the pace, but there's no tension whatsoever because you know exactly how it will end. Everyone who watches the first ten minutes of this thing knows that the climax is going to be James Woods talking for way too long and then getting killed, so why take so damn long to get there? It's not all bad though, because in the end "The Specialist" shows us the most unconvicing movie kiss I've ever seen. It almost makes everything worth it. Almost.

Stallone doesn't got anything to do in terms of action and acting , so it's no surprise that he gives a bad performance. He's lost as the whole movie. Sharon Stone looks great and actually gives a nice performance . Along with "Casino" and "Basic instinct" this is her best performance . She's both sexy and vulnerable. James Woods gives a typical James Woods performance . He's a lovely asshole in this one. It was good to see Eric Roberts in small , but nice part. The director Luis Llosa rather awfully directs the whole movie . The pacing is flat and the whole movie lacks tension . It just drags the whole time from beginning to the end. The screenplay is also unimpressive since audience is able to see the so-called "twists" long before they appear. Is there anything good about this movie ? I actually REALLY enjoyed the romance between Stallone and Stone . There is undeniable sexual tension between them . I also enjoyed the sex scene (against popular opinion). And there is plenty of nice looking explosions. I give it 3/10.

    Somehow I missed this film in first release, which is so surprising because the themes are very similar to my favorite action/romance film, Tequila Sunrise, which was released six years earlier. Here we see Sly, Sharon, James and Eric at the height of their physical beauty, and the acting's not that bad either. If you are a fan of action films and appreciate that back in the 80s and 90s we used to get a little gratuitous sex along with our violence, then this film is for you. Okay, Spoiler Alert: the denouement is a soft porn shower scene. I especially appreciate Sly's flank as he rolls over Sharon. supine on the shower floor. Delicious. Enjoy!

    "The Specialist" is probably not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it is surprisingly bland for a Stallone flick. Everyone involved just seems to be sleepwalking through it, which is the last thing you want to see in an action flick. Director Luis Llosa (of "Anaconda"...fame?) probably can't do much better than this, but I've never seen Sly look so bored throughout a movie. Same with Eric Roberts, usually his bad guy schtick is pretty entertaining but this performance is just totally phoned in. Particularly the first half of "The Specialist" drags like crazy, the only thing that kept me awake there is Sharon Stone's intense hatred for bras. In the second half the movie does manage to pick up the pace, but there's no tension whatsoever because you know exactly how it will end. Everyone who watches the first ten minutes of this thing knows that the climax is going to be James Woods talking for way too long and then getting killed, so why take so damn long to get there? It's not all bad though, because in the end "The Specialist" shows us the most unconvicing movie kiss I've ever seen. It almost makes everything worth it. Almost.

    Stallone never could act at all but he comes off pretty well in this trashily risible flick alongside a hammy and ancient-looking Rod Steiger, a truly dreadful Eric Roberts, and the King of Hammy Overacting himself James Woods. However Sharon Stone is badly miscast as May Munro. Stone was never much of an actress and she only became famous by taking all her clothes off for a very exploitative piece of garbage called "Basic Instinct", when she was already in her mid-thirties. In this film she was 36, yet we are supposed to believe that as a child she witnessed her parents get killed by Eric Roberts. That is just laughable, when Stone and Roberts are clearly the same age. It would have been more believable if Woods had played the Roberts role. It's hard to believe this movie had a cinema release. Nowadays it would just go straight to DVD. 0/10.

    The filmmakers spent a lot on this movie. Big names: Stallone, Stone, Roberts (Eric), Steiger and Woods. The score is by John Barry, Emilio Estefan Jr was involved and appears in the film. A huge number of people were involved behind the scenes too. So do we get end product? No. Stallone goes through the motions Â– the illogical and unnecessary violence, the contrived stunts, the flat delivery and the lack of facial expression. Stone looks gorgeous and waits for some interesting dialogue to be delivered to her. It doesn't come. Roberts looks angry in every scene Â– presumably with his agent. Woods gives it some effort but he's got nothing to work with. Steiger is almost unrecognisable. If I tell you that I saw this on a satellite channel, and I actually looked forward to the adverts, you'll get some idea of just how bad this is. And the only thing steamy in the shower scene is the steam. This film well deserved its Razzie awards: worst actress (Stone) and worst screen couple (Stallone/Stone) Should have also won (but was only nominated for) worst actor (Stallone), worst supporting actor (Steiger) and, finally, worst picture. Everyone involved with this should be embarrassed, and that's a lot of people. I'll give it two stars cos I still like Sharon Stone. She just made a huge mistake on this one.

    THE SPECIALIST I love cheesy action movies... especially those from the 80s and 90s. And let's face it... the royalty of action movies has to be Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone. I had seen The Specialist a long time ago, but I didn't remember much about it... apart from the most famous scene in the movie. I really enjoyed it... it was good action and also a good thriller too. This was made when Sylvester Stallone was in his prime in my opinion. He made some classic films in the 90s. One of my favourite movies of the 90s is Demolition Man. This is not one of his best movies, but it is still a very good one. In case you don't remember it, the story is about a guy who is a trained killer hired by the government who goes into retirement after an innocent person gets killed by mistake. He gets hired by a lady who saw her parents get murdered when she was a little girl, to kill the guy who killed her parents. He is the son of a mafia boss. The problem is, Stallones old boss now works for the mafia. The acting is pretty much what you would expect from a cheesy action film. It's alright but some of it is comical. Sharon Stone plays the lady that hired him and she does a great job in this. But then back in the day I liked her as an actress. She has made some great films. Eric Roberts plays the guy that Stallone is after. Eric is really good at playing a bad guy... although I think he was really good in Best of the Best. He has been is so many big movies, yet doesn't seem to get the recognition he deserves. Rod Steiger plays the mafia boss... he is funny. His accent just sounds so fake that every time he spoke I smiled. J I will give this film a 7 out of 10. I really liked it, but Stallone has made better.

    It's pretty simple really, this is an appalling film, honestly just awful. But like so many other films that have virtually nothing going for them somehow it kept me watching. There are 3 caveats to that statement - firstly, it was on TV so I hadn't wasted any cash renting it out, secondly I didn't actually make it to the end, but if it hadn't been for an inconveniently placed ad break i'd probably have watched on, and thirdly I am mentally ill (or at least I must be for staying up late to watch this). I don't know if this is due to my snazzy new TV but somehow it looked like it had been filmed on an HD home video camera. Perhaps the extra clarity of the screen just served to expose the awfulness of the cinematography. There were scenes, particularly one in a bar, that looked like they could have been straight out of Home & Away. Strangely though it wasn't even an HD broadcast, so it could really be that this film is, after all, that bad. Anyway, there's not a huge amount to add to what has already been said, Stallone is just Stallone, as is Roberts (as in he's Roberts, not Stallone.. if you see what I mean). Steiger (head of the Leon family) is about as menacing as my mum. Woods hams it up quite well all things considered. Stone is awful, but in this company looks like she should be up for an Oscar, as should the loud shirt that is the recipient of the best line in the film when Woods comes out of a lift (you'll have to watch it just for that). It's worth watching because it is sooooo bad, and you will laugh out loud many, many times, so on that basis I recommend this movie wholeheartedly (but still can't bring myself to give it more than 3/10).

    I have seen this movie back in 1994 or 1995 when it came out. Frankly, I did not have any memory regarding this one at all and along came the opportunity to watch it again and I got to say, this is one of the worst movie experiences I've had in a long time. First of all, the movie is the typical clich&eacute; type story with two buddies becoming enemies. Then the movie is moving so slowly, it is hard to watch. Along with the completely displaced John Barry score, the movie creators obviously tried to go for something more artistic in an action movie, but they failed miserably. However, the action is missing. Just a few predictable and unspectacular explosions. The characters are all annoying and not even the main character played by Stallone receives my sympathy. Don't watch it. It is a complete waste of time. More importantly, if you have watched it already, don't watch it again.

    Full of entertainment. Nicely paced with minimum of dialogues and full of action. The muscles of Sly and beauty of Stone work well. But for me James Wood is simply superb and somewhat stole the show with witty performance. Sly is as usual as is Sharon Stone, however Eric Roberts did justice to his role. Plot was almost non existent but you don't need it in such a fast movie. And yes, don't miss the opening shot of Sly and Wood. It is vary good The fight scene in the bus with Sly saying "I hate knives" was a good piece of direction. Don't miss it just sit back and enjoy. You might want to see it one more time, maybe.

    The Specialist is not a great movie. Don't mistake my 8 for this being a cinematic masterpiece. But as one of the all time great Stallone fans I found this indubitably entertaining. It has a masterful performance of a villain (James Woods), a ton of ridiculous campy one liners, an equally campy and gratuitous red light sex scene that tries to channel 9 1/2 Weeks and Stallone being...Stallone. It was ridiculously campy and perfectly entertaining. Anyone that goes into this expecting any more than what it provides went in with ridiculous expectations. It has plenty of action, a ton of explosions, an appropriately cheesy 80's-esque storyline and the first 20 minutes is Stallone doing what he does best. The scene of him on the bus busting hooligans heads so that a woman can have a bus seat...random and awesome all at once. On the surface and by all accounts it really a terrible movie but look at it from a sheer fun and cheese factor. I don't think I had ever watched it before and it was just completely entertaining. If you love Sylvester Stallone like I do then you know what to expect from him. In The Specialist he is a quiet brooding explosions expert who becomes obsessed with his latest client. Stallone grunts and says a few one liners and kills people the way we love him to do. He is good in the role and while it doesn't stretch his acting ability by any means, it was a good role for him. Sharon Stone...man is she awful. I don't recall seeing her in anything where she impressed me. She was certainly sexy in this but her melodramatic performance is laughable. The chemistry with her and Stallone is pretty good...I actually think they're one random completely gratuitous sex scene was at least almost hot. She is definitely one of the weaker points of this film but she pulls off the role just barely. James Woods might be the number one reason to watch this movie. This isn't a new role for him, in fact I felt like I'd seen him do this before but he was great at it. He plays a maniacal former CIA operative and bomb expert who is now working private security for a mobster. He is ruthless, fast talking and downright evil. He is brilliant in this role!! He is the perfect adversary for Stallone. Eric Roberts has a small role as the sleazy son of the mob boss. Roberts is good...he plays sleazy well and the best scenes are his interactions with Woods but he is mostly expendable (no pun I swear) and doesn't make a big impression. The legendary Rod Steiger is the mob boss himself. Steiger doesn't have a huge role but he has some solid scenes (again the best of which are opposite Woods) but something about him and his charisma commands attention on screen. Director Luis Llosa isn't exactly a household name. He has had some okay films under his belt including Anaconda and Sniper and has worked with some big names with those films and this one. He seems content to stay in the realm of average. I think he probably let Stallone, Woods and Stone do what they do best and let the story unfold. The story is actually very good and was actually considered one of the best scripts in circulation in Hollywood before it was made. It has lots of twists and turns and enough explosions to keep any action fan happy. Its a drama, its a romance, its a baby-blue type erotic thriller, and its an action flick. If you don't see it for what it is then you will certainly be disappointed. Nothing about it is amazing (with the exception of maybe Woods) but everything about it is entertaining. It was a good time and it thoroughly filled my Stallone quota so for that reason I am scoring it a solid 8. Might seem ridiculous to some but I am voting strictly on entertainment value and I go with my gut!! 8/10

    Â„The Specialist" doesn't work as either thriller (because there are no REAL plot twists) or as a action movie (because there is no REAL action) . The whole movie just doesn't have much to offer to a viewer . Stallone is miscast in the title role . It's just unbelievable for me that someone as strong as Stallone would be also an expert when it comes to bombs . The role should be played be someone with more intellectual look . There is no real reason for Stallone to play that part . There are only two fight scenes and they hardly anything spectacular ( not too mention that the second one was forced into the movie probably because of fear that audience will die of boredom) . Stallone doesn't got anything to do in terms of action and acting , so it's no surprise that he gives a bad performance. He's lost as the whole movie. Sharon Stone looks great and actually gives a nice performance . Along with "Casino" and "Basic instinct" this is her best performance . She's both sexy and vulnerable. James Woods gives a typical James Woods performance . He's a lovely asshole in this one. It was good to see Eric Roberts in small , but nice part. The director Luis Llosa rather awfully directs the whole movie . The pacing is flat and the whole movie lacks tension . It just drags the whole time from beginning to the end. The screenplay is also unimpressive since audience is able to see the so-called "twists" long before they appear. Is there anything good about this movie ?

On the surface and by all accounts it really a terrible movie but look at it from a sheer fun and cheese factor. I don't think I had ever watched it before and it was just completely entertaining. If you love Sylvester Stallone like I do then you know what to expect from him. In The Specialist he is a quiet brooding explosions expert who becomes obsessed with his latest client. Stallone grunts and says a few one liners and kills people the way we love him to do. He is good in the role and while it doesn't stretch his acting ability by any means, it was a good role for him. Sharon Stone...man is she awful. I don't recall seeing her in anything where she impressed me. She was certainly sexy in this but her melodramatic performance is laughable. The chemistry with her and Stallone is pretty good...I actually think they're one random completely gratuitous sex scene was at least almost hot. She is definitely one of the weaker points of this film but she pulls off the role just barely. James Woods might be the number one reason to watch this movie. This isn't a new role for him, in fact I felt like I'd seen him do this before but he was great at it. He plays a maniacal former CIA operative and bomb expert who is now working private security for a mobster. He is ruthless, fast talking and downright evil. He is brilliant in this role!! He is the perfect adversary for Stallone. Eric Roberts has a small role as the sleazy son of the mob boss. Roberts is good...he plays sleazy well and the best scenes are his interactions with Woods but he is mostly expendable (no pun I swear) and doesn't make a big impression. The legendary Rod Steiger is the mob boss himself. Steiger doesn't have a huge role but he has some solid scenes (again the best of which are opposite Woods) but something about him and his charisma commands attention on screen. Director Luis Llosa isn't exactly a household name. He has had some okay films under his belt including Anaconda and Sniper and has worked with some big names with those films and this one. He seems content to stay in the realm of average. I think he probably let Stallone, Woods and Stone do what they do best and let the story unfold. The story is actually very good and was actually considered one of the best scripts in circulation in Hollywood before it was made. It has lots of twists and turns and enough explosions to keep any action fan happy. Its a drama, its a romance, its a baby-blue type erotic thriller, and its an action flick. If you don't see it for what it is then you will certainly be disappointed. Nothing about it is amazing (with the exception of maybe Woods) but everything about it is entertaining. It was a good time and it thoroughly filled my Stallone quota so for that reason I am scoring it a solid 8. Might seem ridiculous to some but I am voting strictly on entertainment value and I go with my gut!! 8/10

    Â„The Specialist" doesn't work as either thriller (because there are no REAL plot twists) or as a action movie (because there is no REAL action) . The whole movie just doesn't have much to offer to a viewer . Stallone is miscast in the title role . It's just unbelievable for me that someone as strong as Stallone would be also an expert when it comes to bombs . The role should be played be someone with more intellectual look . There is no real reason for Stallone to play that part . There are only two fight scenes and they hardly anything spectacular ( not too mention that the second one was forced into the movie probably because of fear that audience will die of boredom) . Stallone doesn't got anything to do in terms of action and acting , so it's no surprise that he gives a bad performance. He's lost as the whole movie. Sharon Stone looks great and actually gives a nice performance . Along with "Casino" and "Basic instinct" this is her best performance . She's both sexy and vulnerable. James Woods gives a typical James Woods performance . He's a lovely asshole in this one. It was good to see Eric Roberts in small , but nice part. The director Luis Llosa rather awfully directs the whole movie . The pacing is flat and the whole movie lacks tension . It just drags the whole time from beginning to the end. The screenplay is also unimpressive since audience is able to see the so-called "twists" long before they appear. Is there anything good about this movie ? I actually REALLY enjoyed the romance between Stallone and Stone . There is undeniable sexual tension between them . I also enjoyed the sex scene (against popular opinion). And there is plenty of nice looking explosions. I give it 3/10.

    Somehow I missed this film in first release, which is so surprising because the themes are very similar to my favorite action/romance film, Tequila Sunrise, which was released six years earlier. Here we see Sly, Sharon, James and Eric at the height of their physical beauty, and the acting's not that bad either. If you are a fan of action films and appreciate that back in the 80s and 90s we used to get a little gratuitous sex along with our violence, then this film is for you. Okay, Spoiler Alert: the denouement is a soft porn shower scene. I especially appreciate Sly's flank as he rolls over Sharon. supine on the shower floor. Delicious. Enjoy!

    "The Specialist" is probably not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it is surprisingly bland for a Stallone flick. Everyone involved just seems to be sleepwalking through it, which is the last thing you want to see in an action flick. Director Luis Llosa (of "Anaconda"...fame?) probably can't do much better than this, but I've never seen Sly look so bored throughout a movie. Same with Eric Roberts, usually his bad guy schtick is pretty entertaining but this performance is just totally phoned in. Particularly the first half of "The Specialist" drags like crazy, the only thing that kept me awake there is Sharon Stone's intense hatred for bras. In the second half the movie does manage to pick up the pace, but there's no tension whatsoever because you know exactly how it will end. Everyone who watches the first ten minutes of this thing knows that the climax is going to be James Woods talking for way too long and then getting killed, so why take so damn long to get there? It's not all bad though, because in the end "The Specialist" shows us the most unconvicing movie kiss I've ever seen. It almost makes everything worth it. Almost.

    Stallone never could act at all but he comes off pretty well in this trashily risible flick alongside a hammy and ancient-looking Rod Steiger, a truly dreadful Eric Roberts, and the King of Hammy Overacting himself James Woods. However Sharon Stone is badly miscast as May Munro. Stone was never much of an actress and she only became famous by taking all her clothes off for a very exploitative piece of garbage called "Basic Instinct", when she was already in her mid-thirties. In this film she was 36, yet we are supposed to believe that as a child she witnessed her parents get killed by Eric Roberts. That is just laughable, when Stone and Roberts are clearly the same age. It would have been more believable if Woods had played the Roberts role. It's hard to believe this movie had a cinema release. Nowadays it would just go straight to DVD. 0/10.

    The filmmakers spent a lot on this movie. Big names: Stallone, Stone, Roberts (Eric), Steiger and Woods. The score is by John Barry, Emilio Estefan Jr was involved and appears in the film. A huge number of people were involved behind the scenes too. So do we get end product? No. Stallone goes through the motions Â– the illogical and unnecessary violence, the contrived stunts, the flat delivery and the lack of facial expression. Stone looks gorgeous and waits for some interesting dialogue to be delivered to her. It doesn't come. Roberts looks angry in every scene Â– presumably with his agent. Woods gives it some effort but he's got nothing to work with. Steiger is almost unrecognisable. If I tell you that I saw this on a satellite channel, and I actually looked forward to the adverts, you'll get some idea of just how bad this is. And the only thing steamy in the shower scene is the steam. This film well deserved its Razzie awards: worst actress (Stone) and worst screen couple (Stallone/Stone) Should have also won (but was only nominated for) worst actor (Stallone), worst supporting actor (Steiger) and, finally, worst picture. Everyone involved with this should be embarrassed, and that's a lot of people. I'll give it two stars cos I still like Sharon Stone. She just made a huge mistake on this one.

    THE SPECIALIST I love cheesy action movies... especially those from the 80s and 90s. And let's face it... the royalty of action movies has to be Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone. I had seen The Specialist a long time ago, but I didn't remember much about it... apart from the most famous scene in the movie. I really enjoyed it... it was good action and also a good thriller too. This was made when Sylvester Stallone was in his prime in my opinion. He made some classic films in the 90s. One of my favourite movies of the 90s is Demolition Man. This is not one of his best movies, but it is still a very good one. In case you don't remember it, the story is about a guy who is a trained killer hired by the government who goes into retirement after an innocent person gets killed by mistake. He gets hired by a lady who saw her parents get murdered when she was a little girl, to kill the guy who killed her parents. He is the son of a mafia boss. The problem is, Stallones old boss now works for the mafia. The acting is pretty much what you would expect from a cheesy action film. It's alright but some of it is comical. Sharon Stone plays the lady that hired him and she does a great job in this. But then back in the day I liked her as an actress. She has made some great films. Eric Roberts plays the guy that Stallone is after. Eric is really good at playing a bad guy... although I think he was really good in Best of the Best. He has been is so many big movies, yet doesn't seem to get the recognition he deserves. Rod Steiger plays the mafia boss... he is funny. His accent just sounds so fake that every time he spoke I smiled. J I will give this film a 7 out of 10. I really liked it, but Stallone has made better.

    It's pretty simple really, this is an appalling film, honestly just awful. But like so many other films that have virtually nothing going for them somehow it kept me watching. There are 3 caveats to that statement - firstly, it was on TV so I hadn't wasted any cash renting it out, secondly I didn't actually make it to the end, but if it hadn't been for an inconveniently placed ad break i'd probably have watched on, and thirdly I am mentally ill (or at least I must be for staying up late to watch this). I don't know if this is due to my snazzy new TV but somehow it looked like it had been filmed on an HD home video camera. Perhaps the extra clarity of the screen just served to expose the awfulness of the cinematography. There were scenes, particularly one in a bar, that looked like they could have been straight out of Home & Away. Strangely though it wasn't even an HD broadcast, so it could really be that this film is, after all, that bad. Anyway, there's not a huge amount to add to what has already been said, Stallone is just Stallone, as is Roberts (as in he's Roberts, not Stallone.. if you see what I mean). Steiger (head of the Leon family) is about as menacing as my mum. Woods hams it up quite well all things considered. Stone is awful, but in this company looks like she should be up for an Oscar, as should the loud shirt that is the recipient of the best line in the film when Woods comes out of a lift (you'll have to watch it just for that). It's worth watching because it is sooooo bad, and you will laugh out loud many, many times, so on that basis I recommend this movie wholeheartedly (but still can't bring myself to give it more than 3/10).

    I have seen this movie back in 1994 or 1995 when it came out. Frankly, I did not have any memory regarding this one at all and along came the opportunity to watch it again and I got to say, this is one of the worst movie experiences I've had in a long time. First of all, the movie is the typical clich&eacute; type story with two buddies becoming enemies. Then the movie is moving so slowly, it is hard to watch. Along with the completely displaced John Barry score, the movie creators obviously tried to go for something more artistic in an action movie, but they failed miserably. However, the action is missing. Just a few predictable and unspectacular explosions. The characters are all annoying and not even the main character played by Stallone receives my sympathy. Don't watch it. It is a complete waste of time. More importantly, if you have watched it already, don't watch it again.

    Full of entertainment. Nicely paced with minimum of dialogues and full of action. The muscles of Sly and beauty of Stone work well. But for me James Wood is simply superb and somewhat stole the show with witty performance. Sly is as usual as is Sharon Stone, however Eric Roberts did justice to his role. Plot was almost non existent but you don't need it in such a fast movie. And yes, don't miss the opening shot of Sly and Wood. It is vary good The fight scene in the bus with Sly saying "I hate knives" was a good piece of direction. Don't miss it just sit back and enjoy. You might want to see it one more time, maybe.

    The Specialist is not a great movie. Don't mistake my 8 for this being a cinematic masterpiece. But as one of the all time great Stallone fans I found this indubitably entertaining. It has a masterful performance of a villain (James Woods), a ton of ridiculous campy one liners, an equally campy and gratuitous red light sex scene that tries to channel 9 1/2 Weeks and Stallone being...Stallone. It was ridiculously campy and perfectly entertaining. Anyone that goes into this expecting any more than what it provides went in with ridiculous expectations. It has plenty of action, a ton of explosions, an appropriately cheesy 80's-esque storyline and the first 20 minutes is Stallone doing what he does best. The scene of him on the bus busting hooligans heads so that a woman can have a bus seat...random and awesome all at once. On the surface and by all accounts it really a terrible movie but look at it from a sheer fun and cheese factor. I don't think I had ever watched it before and it was just completely entertaining. If you love Sylvester Stallone like I do then you know what to expect from him. In The Specialist he is a quiet brooding explosions expert who becomes obsessed with his latest client. Stallone grunts and says a few one liners and kills people the way we love him to do. He is good in the role and while it doesn't stretch his acting ability by any means, it was a good role for him. Sharon Stone...man is she awful. I don't recall seeing her in anything where she impressed me. She was certainly sexy in this but her melodramatic performance is laughable. The chemistry with her and Stallone is pretty good...I actually think they're one random completely gratuitous sex scene was at least almost hot.

This isn't a new role for him, in fact I felt like I'd seen him do this before but he was great at it. He plays a maniacal former CIA operative and bomb expert who is now working private security for a mobster. He is ruthless, fast talking and downright evil. He is brilliant in this role!!

The story is actually very good and was actually considered one of the best scripts in circulation in Hollywood before it was made.

It was a good time and it thoroughly filled my Stallone quota so for that reason I am scoring it a solid 8.

It's worth watching because it is sooooo bad, and you will laugh out loud many, many times, so on that basis I recommend this movie wholeheartedly (but still can't bring myself to give it more than 3/10).

    I have seen this movie back in 1994 or 1995 when it came out. Frankly, I did not have any memory regarding this one at all and along came the opportunity to watch it again and I got to say, this is one of the worst movie experiences I've had in a long time. First of all, the movie is the typical clich&eacute; type story with two buddies becoming enemies. Then the movie is moving so slowly, it is hard to watch. Along with the completely displaced John Barry score, the movie creators obviously tried to go for something more artistic in an action movie, but they failed miserably. However, the action is missing. Just a few predictable and unspectacular explosions. The characters are all annoying and not even the main character played by Stallone receives my sympathy. Don't watch it. It is a complete waste of time. More importantly, if you have watched it already, don't watch it again.

    Full of entertainment. Nicely paced with minimum of dialogues and full of action. The muscles of Sly and beauty of Stone work well. But for me James Wood is simply superb and somewhat stole the show with witty performance. Sly is as usual as is Sharon Stone, however Eric Roberts did justice to his role. Plot was almost non existent but you don't need it in such a fast movie. And yes, don't miss the opening shot of Sly and Wood. It is vary good The fight scene in the bus with Sly saying "I hate knives" was a good piece of direction. Don't miss it just sit back and enjoy. You might want to see it one more time, maybe.

    The Specialist is not a great movie. Don't mistake my 8 for this being a cinematic masterpiece. But as one of the all time great Stallone fans I found this indubitably entertaining. It has a masterful performance of a villain (James Woods), a ton of ridiculous campy one liners, an equally campy and gratuitous red light sex scene that tries to channel 9 1/2 Weeks and Stallone being...Stallone. It was ridiculously campy and perfectly entertaining. Anyone that goes into this expecting any more than what it provides went in with ridiculous expectations. It has plenty of action, a ton of explosions, an appropriately cheesy 80's-esque storyline and the first 20 minutes is Stallone doing what he does best. The scene of him on the bus busting hooligans heads so that a woman can have a bus seat...random and awesome all at once. On the surface and by all accounts it really a terrible movie but look at it from a sheer fun and cheese factor. I don't think I had ever watched it before and it was just completely entertaining. If you love Sylvester Stallone like I do then you know what to expect from him. In The Specialist he is a quiet brooding explosions expert who becomes obsessed with his latest client. Stallone grunts and says a few one liners and kills people the way we love him to do. He is good in the role and while it doesn't stretch his acting ability by any means, it was a good role for him. Sharon Stone...man is she awful. I don't recall seeing her in anything where she impressed me. She was certainly sexy in this but her melodramatic performance is laughable. The chemistry with her and Stallone is pretty good...I actually think they're one random completely gratuitous sex scene was at least almost hot. She is definitely one of the weaker points of this film but she pulls off the role just barely. James Woods might be the number one reason to watch this movie. This isn't a new role for him, in fact I felt like I'd seen him do this before but he was great at it. He plays a maniacal former CIA operative and bomb expert who is now working private security for a mobster. He is ruthless, fast talking and downright evil. He is brilliant in this role!! He is the perfect adversary for Stallone. Eric Roberts has a small role as the sleazy son of the mob boss. Roberts is good...he plays sleazy well and the best scenes are his interactions with Woods but he is mostly expendable (no pun I swear) and doesn't make a big impression. The legendary Rod Steiger is the mob boss himself. Steiger doesn't have a huge role but he has some solid scenes (again the best of which are opposite Woods) but something about him and his charisma commands attention on screen. Director Luis Llosa isn't exactly a household name. He has had some okay films under his belt including Anaconda and Sniper and has worked with some big names with those films and this one. He seems content to stay in the realm of average. I think he probably let Stallone, Woods and Stone do what they do best and let the story unfold. The story is actually very good and was actually considered one of the best scripts in circulation in Hollywood before it was made. It has lots of twists and turns and enough explosions to keep any action fan happy. Its a drama, its a romance, its a baby-blue type erotic thriller, and its an action flick. If you don't see it for what it is then you will certainly be disappointed. Nothing about it is amazing (with the exception of maybe Woods) but everything about it is entertaining. It was a good time and it thoroughly filled my Stallone quota so for that reason I am scoring it a solid 8. Might seem ridiculous to some but I am voting strictly on entertainment value and I go with my gut!! 8/10

    Â„The Specialist" doesn't work as either thriller (because there are no REAL plot twists) or as a action movie (because there is no REAL action) . The whole movie just doesn't have much to offer to a viewer . Stallone is miscast in the title role . It's just unbelievable for me that someone as strong as Stallone would be also an expert when it comes to bombs . The role should be played be someone with more intellectual look . There is no real reason for Stallone to play that part . There are only two fight scenes and they hardly anything spectacular ( not too mention that the second one was forced into the movie probably because of fear that audience will die of boredom) . Stallone doesn't got anything to do in terms of action and acting , so it's no surprise that he gives a bad performance. He's lost as the whole movie. Sharon Stone looks great and actually gives a nice performance . Along with "Casino" and "Basic instinct" this is her best performance . She's both sexy and vulnerable. James Woods gives a typical James Woods performance . He's a lovely asshole in this one. It was good to see Eric Roberts in small , but nice part. The director Luis Llosa rather awfully directs the whole movie . The pacing is flat and the whole movie lacks tension . It just drags the whole time from beginning to the end. The screenplay is also unimpressive since audience is able to see the so-called "twists" long before they appear. Is there anything good about this movie ? I actually REALLY enjoyed the romance between Stallone and Stone . There is undeniable sexual tension between them . I also enjoyed the sex scene (against popular opinion). And there is plenty of nice looking explosions. I give it 3/10.

    Somehow I missed this film in first release, which is so surprising because the themes are very similar to my favorite action/romance film, Tequila Sunrise, which was released six years earlier. Here we see Sly, Sharon, James and Eric at the height of their physical beauty, and the acting's not that bad either. If you are a fan of action films and appreciate that back in the 80s and 90s we used to get a little gratuitous sex along with our violence, then this film is for you. Okay, Spoiler Alert: the denouement is a soft porn shower scene. I especially appreciate Sly's flank as he rolls over Sharon. supine on the shower floor. Delicious. Enjoy!

    "The Specialist" is probably not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it is surprisingly bland for a Stallone flick. Everyone involved just seems to be sleepwalking through it, which is the last thing you want to see in an action flick. Director Luis Llosa (of "Anaconda"...fame?) probably can't do much better than this, but I've never seen Sly look so bored throughout a movie. Same with Eric Roberts, usually his bad guy schtick is pretty entertaining but this performance is just totally phoned in. Particularly the first half of "The Specialist" drags like crazy, the only thing that kept me awake there is Sharon Stone's intense hatred for bras. In the second half the movie does manage to pick up the pace, but there's no tension whatsoever because you know exactly how it will end. Everyone who watches the first ten minutes of this thing knows that the climax is going to be James Woods talking for way too long and then getting killed, so why take so damn long to get there? It's not all bad though, because in the end "The Specialist" shows us the most unconvicing movie kiss I've ever seen. It almost makes everything worth it. Almost.

    Stallone never could act at all but he comes off pretty well in this trashily risible flick alongside a hammy and ancient-looking Rod Steiger, a truly dreadful Eric Roberts, and the King of Hammy Overacting himself James Woods. However Sharon Stone is badly miscast as May Munro. Stone was never much of an actress and she only became famous by taking all her clothes off for a very exploitative piece of garbage called "Basic Instinct", when she was already in her mid-thirties. In this film she was 36, yet we are supposed to believe that as a child she witnessed her parents get killed by Eric Roberts. That is just laughable, when Stone and Roberts are clearly the same age. It would have been more believable if Woods had played the Roberts role. It's hard to believe this movie had a cinema release. Nowadays it would just go straight to DVD. 0/10.

    The filmmakers spent a lot on this movie. Big names: Stallone, Stone, Roberts (Eric), Steiger and Woods. The score is by John Barry, Emilio Estefan Jr was involved and appears in the film. A huge number of people were involved behind the scenes too. So do we get end product? No. Stallone goes through the motions Â– the illogical and unnecessary violence, the contrived stunts, the flat delivery and the lack of facial expression. Stone looks gorgeous and waits for some interesting dialogue to be delivered to her. It doesn't come. Roberts looks angry in every scene Â– presumably with his agent. Woods gives it some effort but he's got nothing to work with. Steiger is almost unrecognisable. If I tell you that I saw this on a satellite channel, and I actually looked forward to the adverts, you'll get some idea of just how bad this is. And the only thing steamy in the shower scene is the steam. This film well deserved its Razzie awards: worst actress (Stone) and worst screen couple (Stallone/Stone) Should have also won (but was only nominated for) worst actor (Stallone), worst supporting actor (Steiger) and, finally, worst picture. Everyone involved with this should be embarrassed, and that's a lot of people. I'll give it two stars cos I still like Sharon Stone. She just made a huge mistake on this one.

    THE SPECIALIST I love cheesy action movies... especially those from the 80s and 90s. And let's face it... the royalty of action movies has to be Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone. I had seen The Specialist a long time ago, but I didn't remember much about it... apart from the most famous scene in the movie. I really enjoyed it... it was good action and also a good thriller too. This was made when Sylvester Stallone was in his prime in my opinion. He made some classic films in the 90s. One of my favourite movies of the 90s is Demolition Man. This is not one of his best movies, but it is still a very good one. In case you don't remember it, the story is about a guy who is a trained killer hired by the government who goes into retirement after an innocent person gets killed by mistake. He gets hired by a lady who saw her parents get murdered when she was a little girl, to kill the guy who killed her parents. He is the son of a mafia boss. The problem is, Stallones old boss now works for the mafia. The acting is pretty much what you would expect from a cheesy action film. It's alright but some of it is comical. Sharon Stone plays the lady that hired him and she does a great job in this. But then back in the day I liked her as an actress. She has made some great films. Eric Roberts plays the guy that Stallone is after. Eric is really good at playing a bad guy... although I think he was really good in Best of the Best. He has been is so many big movies, yet doesn't seem to get the recognition he deserves. Rod Steiger plays the mafia boss... he is funny. His accent just sounds so fake that every time he spoke I smiled. J I will give this film a 7 out of 10. I really liked it, but Stallone has made better.

    It's pretty simple really, this is an appalling film, honestly just awful. But like so many other films that have virtually nothing going for them somehow it kept me watching. There are 3 caveats to that statement - firstly, it was on TV so I hadn't wasted any cash renting it out, secondly I didn't actually make it to the end, but if it hadn't been for an inconveniently placed ad break i'd probably have watched on, and thirdly I am mentally ill (or at least I must be for staying up late to watch this). I don't know if this is due to my snazzy new TV but somehow it looked like it had been filmed on an HD home video camera. Perhaps the extra clarity of the screen just served to expose the awfulness of the cinematography. There were scenes, particularly one in a bar, that looked like they could have been straight out of Home & Away. Strangely though it wasn't even an HD broadcast, so it could really be that this film is, after all, that bad. Anyway, there's not a huge amount to add to what has already been said, Stallone is just Stallone, as is Roberts (as in he's Roberts, not Stallone.. if you see what I mean). Steiger (head of the Leon family) is about as menacing as my mum. Woods hams it up quite well all things considered. Stone is awful, but in this company looks like she should be up for an Oscar, as should the loud shirt that is the recipient of the best line in the film when Woods comes out of a lift (you'll have to watch it just for that). It's worth watching because it is sooooo bad, and you will laugh out loud many, many times, so on that basis I recommend this movie wholeheartedly (but still can't bring myself to give it more than 3/10).
