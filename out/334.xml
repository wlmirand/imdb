    Oliver Stone's film is full of quirky characters and does a U-turn from being a complicated little thriller into the realm of black comedy. Stone turned up the irony knob just a little too high in "U Turn"; no one wins and everyone meets an end that has its own ironic twist. Sean Penn plays Bobby Cooper, an unlikely tennis coach who is driving across Nevada with a bag of money. He needs to repay a debt to criminals who have cut off two of his fingers to expedite the repayment. He takes a U-turn off the main road when his prized, 1964 and a half Mustang Convertible bursts a radiator hose. He ends up in Superior, a dilapidated town 200 miles from Phoenix. Bobby leaves his car to be fixed at a repair shop on the edge of town run by the disgustingly dirty and dentally challenged Darrell played by Billy Bob Thornton. He meets Grace McKenna, Jennifer Lopez's character, who invites him home to help her hang curtains. When Grace's husband Jake, played by Nick Nolte, finds them together, he punches Bobby. Not your typical hero, Bobby falls to the floor whining. He can't take a trick. Robbed, beaten up, conned and used, he has little control over his life. Even his mother hangs up the phone when he rings her for help. Although Jake initially dismisses Bobby as a wimpy, pipsqueak, he offers him money to kill Grace, noting of Bobby's character, "You're a man without scruples," also telling him not to be offended because, "A man who's got no ethics is a free man." At first, Bobby refuses the offer, but after his fortunes plunge even further, he has second thoughts and agrees to kill Grace, leading to more double and triple crosses than it would be thought possible to cram into one movie. As Bobby becomes more involved with Grace, he discovers that she is also Jake's daughter  a U-turn into Roman Polanski territory. However, the surprise twist in Polanski's Chinatown is just more plot overkill in "U Turn". Eventually Bobby and Grace plan to get rid of Jake and take his money. Grace McKenna is very much sought after by men in this movie; an interest that proves fatal to all of them. However, Bobby Cooper is not quite besotted enough to want to share Jake's money with her, and they try everything to outmanoeuvre each other at every turn. The most ironic twist of all is reserved for Bobby when he is virtually the last man standing. No tricky camera angle is avoided in "U Turn", and like so much else in the film, this is overdone to the point that you almost expect every scene to be reflected in someone's sunglasses or viewed between the cameraman's legs. Despite its pretentiousness, the spectacular cast and the outrageous plot keep you going until the end  even if that ending is a bit of a letdown.

    U TURN has a great premise: a drifter shows up in an out-of-the-way town, only to fall foul of the town's weirdo inhabitants and finding himself caught up in intricate plots between various characters. It's directed by Oliver Stone, a man with a history of making challenging cinema, and it has an ensemble cast of familiar actors. What's to go wrong? The story, as it turns out. U TURN falls down because the storyline is bloated and convoluted in equal measure. It meanders from place to place as the minutes and the hours gradually roll by, and you never get closer to any kind of truth or outcome. Come the umpteenth twist at the climax, you no longer care. The central crux of the film is a love triangle but it takes an age for this to go anywhere - THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE this isn't! Instead it's dragged out long beyond any intrigue or entertainment value it might have had. Much of the film involves quirky run-ins with various off-beat characters, but that doesn't make a film. And this time, Stone's direction feels pretentious and off-putting, like he's trying too hard and going overboard with the stylistics. Cast-wise, the main actors don't fair too well. Sean Penn is as unsympathetic as ever; I don't think I've ever seen him play a genuinely warm character. It doesn't bode well. Jennifer Lopez is youthful and refreshingly free of Hollywood-style cosmetic surgery, but her acting is limited. Nick Nolte just feels like he's trying too hard. The supporting stars are better: Billy Bob Thornton as the unrecognisable garage mechanic (shades of A SIMPLE PLAN's Jacob here), Jon Voight as a hobo, Powers Boothe as the sheriff, Joaquin Phoenix as a thug. In a better film, these characters would light up the screen; here, they seem mired in a bit of a mess and a missed opportunity. With a tightened screenplay and a great deal more focus, U TURN might have turned out halfway decent.

    Wow. What a weird movie. And from Oliver Stone no less. But what a cast! Penn, Nolte, Lopez, Boothe, Voight, Thorton, Phoenix, Danes...etc. I expected a little more intensity from Penn. he seemed to weak and easily manipulated. But his character seem to demanded him to be that way. Nolte as the dirty old man who is and has been basically "raping" his step-daughter Lopez, was OK. He seemed very thin back in 1997. maybe the role demanded it. Lopez as the "femme fatale" per say did OK also. Her scenes of making love with Penn and Nolte just did not seemed convincing at all. But still, she held her own with the these two "heavyweights" of the cinema. Boothe was once again doing yet another part as a sheriff. But I felt he was wasted as usual. he really didn't have much to do but just get killed. Phoenix as T.N.T was a treat. he seemed to remind me of a young Ray Liotta. Intense and psychotic at the same time. All for the "love" of a woman. He was one of the memorable characters of the this unusual film. Danes was wasted as his "girl" who really wants to leave this hick town and leave with Penn. Thus inciting Phoenix's jealousy big-time. Thorton for me stole the picture along with Phoenix. Thorton's 'Darrell' embodied the true redneck nightmare one can encounter in these small one-horse towns. He's scary and funny at the same time. A real complete treat of casting here for Billy Bob. Voight, I did not recognize at 1st! that's how much i was paying attention. But it's because I was focusing on the other characters in the film. Voight's blind guy was somewhat memorable once you know it's him under that makeup. Julie Hargerty's waitress was OK but her scenes were way to short to appreciate them, plus she was somewhat exemplified a little exaggerating as a typical redneck town waitress. Laurie Metcalf fared a little better as the Bus Station Clerk giving Penn a hard time for not having the exact amount to buy a ticket for the bus. But again her role was brief. good but brief. Abraham Benrubi as a biker/thief was also way too brief and was also wasted. he could have been an interesting character, but was blown away way to quickly. And by a little old lady no less! I would have had him cast as the Russian enforcer who shows up at the town looking for Penn. But alas I'm not the writer of the film. Shame. But the two stars that I have no idea why they were in the movie at all because their roles were so inconsequential, that any bit-extra actor could have done their brief cameos!! I'm talking about the great Bo Hopkins and the lovely Liv Tyler. Hopkins cameo just didn't make sense to me. He's in the diner when Penn encounters Phoenix and Danes for the 1st time, but he is just a simple customer in the background!? What the hell? I believe he didn't even have any lines!? I think Stone could have put him to better use as the sheriff of the town. And had Boothe as the mafia guy that Penn owed money to. But the worst cameo was Tyler's blink or you'll miss her as the customer behind Penn at the bus station wanting to buy a ticket and Metcalf's clerk is so distraught over Penn's emotional outburst, that she closes for the day leaving Tyler like "what the hell?" Exactly. what the hell Stone? What was the point of even having her in the bit scene? I guess we will never know. just like the point of this exaggerating pulp nonsense.

    Oliver stone is a bit of an acquired taste. He makes unique movies with visual flair only he can pull off. Some might say he favors style over substance, or that he is just a lunatic with money. The problem with this film however lies within the story. With a great ensemble cast, and stylish direction this movie could have been very enjoyable. Alas it failed to keep me interested with clich&eacute; after clich&eacute;, and honestly a story that was more interesting in words then moving pictures. In fact even though the cast was great all the characters were about as bland and predictable as possible. There's a wealthy old fart married to a hot young woman who hates him, there's a tuff and gritty sheriff, a dirty sneaky mechanic, and even a weak bully with tnt shaved into his hair and a big mouth. The story unfolds much like the characters, predictably. Guy owes money to some criminals, loses the money, gets offered some more money to kill some guys wife, the end. I figured with stone at the helm he could make this all worth while, and like I said it has everything I expected, except for something called a surprise. It was all so straight forward that even all the flashy camera work and wacky acting couldn't save it. If the movie did what it should have, kept me guessing, made me laugh, shock me, anything... it could have been great. It really just didn't do any of it. So despite being well made, well acted, and involving all sorts of talent, it just didn't leave a great impression, and it was almost a chore to sit through, and it really shouldn't have been. All in all its not the worst movie ever made, but its also not one i'll be watching over and over to absorb its brilliance. 4/10

    Oliver Stone directs this John Ridley screenplay entitled U Turn,which is adapted from Ridley's novel Stray Dogs.It features Sean Penn,Nick Nolte and Jennifer Lopez together with Joaquin Phoenix,Powers Boothe,Billy Bob Thornton,Claire Danes and Jon Voight.This film is a Southwestern noir tale about Bobby Cooper, a hotshot who is stuck in the tight confines of Superior, Arizona, when his car breaks down. His subsequent adventure is a meatball comedy which is loud, obnoxious, and violent, and stuffed with diffused light, a hot cast, and a no-fat Ennio Morricone score. A drifter eludes Las Vegas collection agents and arrives in a small town where he decides to linger after his car has a breakdown. Here he gets involved with the locals, including an unhappily married couple - a businessman and his seductive, femme-fatale wife. A trailer trash teen also approaches him in an effort to get away from her abusive boyfriend. Tensions in the town escalate, eventually leading to murder. The first 40 minutes or so are "fun" to a point. Penn is the perfect near-creep to root for, and as he wanders back into town after meeting Grace, the eclectic characters pile up. But soon it gets monotonous, tiring, and just plain ugly. And when incest and bloody fights begin, the fun is gone. If Penn weren't so solid an actor and able to be empathetic in the most morose situations, the movie would be not watchable at stretches. Lopez makes another good impression, but this is not a performance that stands out.While,Nolte is raspy and ill-looking. Before U Turn is over, you are already wondering if Oliver Stone will do something else, something more important, soon.Overall,it is a long and strange trip of a movie that is fun but aimless.

    Not as much as you'd think. It had a chance to work, but ultimately fizzled. I finally got around to watching U TURN, a full 15 years after it came out and sunk at the box office. You never even see it playing on cable, so I had to rent a copy. I just recently watched Stone's latest, SAVAGES, which I did like, but the American public apparently didn't. Anyway,I thought catch up on missed Oliver Stone movies, and this was first up. This movie had a nice look, the acting decent, and the story was OK (for the first hour anyway), but then the drag out, double-crosses (and "triple crosses") just seemed to go on forever. It should have been better, but I just can't figure out why it wasn't. I really wanted it to end soon after Nolte took the direct ax shot, but we still had another unseen plot line to develop with Boothe. Cameos by Julie Hagerty, Laurie Metcalf, and a blink & you'll miss her Liv Tyler were helpful, J. Phoenix always brings it, and the Russian guys were amusing. However, only Penn's scenes with Billy Bob really seemed to hit with some punch. I've always liked Thornton, even when he's sleep-walking through his blockbuster paycheck roles. Anyway, I say take a pass on U TURN, as it's too long and the payoff just ain't worth the wait.

    "U Turn" is often over the top, surreal and comical and Oliver Stone's style of direction plays along with these qualities perfectly. In everything he does, he favours excess over subtlety and utilises a variety of quick and often disconcerting visual techniques to create the hallucinogenic backdrop against which this twisted drama is played out. A collection of highly eccentric characters and some extraordinary performances from a star-studded cast also adds greatly to the enjoyment of watching this interesting treatment of a standard film noir plot (which bears a strong resemblance to "Red Rock West"). Bobby Cooper (Sean Penn)is a drifter who's driving to Las Vegas to pay off some gambling debts when his car's radiator hose blows and he has to make a detour to the town of Superior, Arizona to get a replacement fitted. Whilst his car is being repaired, Bobby goes into the town centre and almost straightaway, meets Grace McKenna (Jennifer Lopez). She's an attractive woman who needs assistance to carry some newly purchased drapes back to her home and Bobby is pleased to help. They start to get friendly and just as Bobby has his arms around her, Grace's husband Jake (Nick Nolte), arrives and punches Bobby to the ground. A little while later, after Bobby's left Grace's house, Jake offers him a significant amount of money to kill his wife because he's tired of her games. Bobby doesn't show any interest in the offer at that time but does later, after he loses all his money in strange circumstances after unintentionally getting caught up in a convenience store robbery. Before Bobby can go ahead with the planned murder, Grace persuades him to kill Jake so that they can steal her husband's money and go away together. They go ahead with their plan but a series of complications follow and eventually lead to a very tense and unpredictable end to the story. Bobby Cooper is a typical noir protagonist who suffers a misfortune that leads to a whole series of other problems, which all inevitably become more serious and dangerous than the last. This ex-tennis player with a gambling problem had already had two fingers cut off by the gangsters to whom he owed money before he arrived in Superior and the bad luck he suffered when his car broke down was exploited by the unscrupulous mechanic at the local garage who kept raising the cost of the job and threatening Bobby in various ways. Bobby's attraction to Grace got him caught up in a web of lust, murder and treachery and random misfortunes led to him losing his money and becoming trapped in this desert town with no means of escape. His awful predicament is then made even worse by his certain knowledge that the gangsters who want their money back know where he is and are coming to get him. Sean Penn is wonderfully intense and conveys his character's sheer desperation with immense power and conviction. There are also, however, very memorable performances by the rest of the cast who all look as if they're having a lot of fun in their roles as some of the most weird and devious people imaginable. Billy Bob Thornton stands out as the malevolent mechanic with a disgusting appearance and Nick Nolte is suitably gruff and repulsive as a man with an appalling past and no morals. Jon Voight makes a big impression as an allegedly blind Vietnam veteran who's a beggar with a penchant for making philosophical pronouncements and Jennifer Lopez is very good as the femme fatale. This neo-noir account of one man's nightmare contains so many elements that are recognisable from other film noirs that it ultimately becomes a glorious pastiche in which its many moments of dark humour act as a marvellous counterpoint to all the evil and violence that are prevalent throughout the whole story.

    What a wild ride this is with a sleazy, quirky assortment of characters. Billy Bob Thornton is a hoot as the gas station attendant. Jennifer Lopez is as hot as ever. But everybody is watching out for everybody in this "noire" classic. There are twists and turns galore and we never quite know what is around the corner. Expect the unexpected. It's got a great assortment of stars, who all play their different roles to perfection in this desert saga of intrigue, bloodlust and murder. Yes the bloodlust can get carried away at times, but it's still a great watch. It's also got humour and a great wrap-up at the end!

    U Turn is a very strange, weird and unusual film. I have recently finished watching it and I am really unsure on what to make of it. Urm, is it good? Not really. Is it bad? Not really. I just don't know what to say about it. The story is about Sean Penn's character, Bobby. He is driving through the desert on route to Vegas to pay off a gambling debt. A debt that has already cost him two fingers. Whilst driving, his radiator hose bursts and the closest place to get it fixed is a little town called Superior. He pulls into a typical looking garage for a deserted town such as this, and is greeted by a fat, hillbilly which is Billy Bob Thornton (who is actually pretty good). Bobby leaves the car in the mechanics hands and heads off to get a drink. Whilst walking through the town he meets Grace (Lopez) and an instant sexual attraction takes place. He ends up helping her put up drapes back at her home but when things heat up her husband (Nolte) arrives home and punches Bobby in the nose. Bobby then leaves the house but is tailed by Jake (J Lo's husband) and is offered money to kill his wife as he can't stand her. Bobby is unsure but when his bag of money is stolen in a grocery shop robbery, he realises he needs the money to pay off his debt or lose more of his fingers. However as he is about to kill her she offers him another proposition, kill her husband and steal his stash of cash he keeps under the floor boards. From here on Bobby must contemplate which route to take. He tries the easy option, to leave the town but the mechanics ridiculous charge for a radiator hose leaves Bobby's beloved Mustang in the mechanic's compound until he pays up. Bobby has no choice, but what will he do to get the money. The story does sound quite intriguing but everything just seems to fall in place far too easily. The characters don't force the plot twists, they just seem to randomly happen and Penn is left turning backwards and forward within this town. We also meet four other characters that seem to have very little to do with the plot other than to show the obscurity of this town. We have a Sheriff (Powers Boothe), a young couple (Claire Danes and Joaquin Phoenix), him always wanting a fight and her willing to run away with any man possible, and we are also given a blind tramp (Jon Voight) with plenty of wisdom to go around. All of these are just potential obstacles or aids and have very little usage. A debt collector comes into town at one point, on a mission to catch Bobby, but within thirty seconds he is arrested. No tension with him then as he is removed far too quickly. We find ourselves re-treading old ground as this film goes on. Each twenty minute segment just seems to repeat itself up until the strange climax. We are just shown how unlucky one man can be, and how strange this little town seems to be. The stars aren't bad with Penn giving a decent performance, I'm sure this wasn't a tough role for him. Lopez is typically her, not great and Nolte is just gruff. The star is perhaps Thornton in his unrecognizable role, it is definitely against type cast and I was fairly impressed with him. The direction isn't bad but the setting is very typical and something we've seen all too often. I was impressed with the editing and felt that there was a trippy feel to the entire film. Several camera movements and points of view shoots were stitched together well and gave a great feel to the movie. That still doesn't make it a good movie though. I was never really engaged with this film. Not once was I hooked and desperate to know what's going to happen next, in fact I didn't really care. The ending was poor and left you with a poor impression of this film. The theme seems to be about being lost and alone and the theme works as the whole way through that was exactly how I felt. 2 / 5 Tolli More reviews at: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com Follow @Tolli04

    The drifter Bobby just wants to get to Las Vegas and pay off his gambling debt. On the road in the Southwest, however, his car breaks down. He gets to the nearby small town of Superior, AZ, and he tries desperately to get back out. He runs into every kind of trouble conceivable there. Half the people he meets cause problems for him. The married couple of femme fatale Grace(an extremely hot Lopez at her most seductive, who does OK when asked to do anything more than be sultry and desirable, which she, of course, nails, pun intended) and Jake(Nolte, undeniably the creepiest presence in this, and he has serious competition for that award) both want him to kill their spouse. Darrell(Thornton in what may be his least appealing role... no, really; he's dumb, cheap, nasty and the oil on his face really gets to you) is the only chance nearby for getting the ride fixed back up, and he isn't exactly... well, all there. Blind Man Jon Voight is eccentric. And teenage Jenny(Danes, convincing as a proper little Lolita-wanna-be) falls in love with every new male face she sees with the same eagerness as her ill-tempered boyfriend Toby(Phoenix) is to beat up everyone she as much as talks to. The characters are memorable, quirky and distinct(even though there are so many of them, they all get a good amount of screen time, and we don't forget any of them). The majority of the acting is spot-on, and this makes solid use of the considerable talent featured. This is shot rather well. The editing will get on some people's nerves(it's very clearly a Stone film, and it's one of his greatest ones, as far as entertainment value goes), and it does arguably try a little hard, if it does succeed in building an atmosphere of unbearable heat, constant new obstacles, mistrust, violence and dirt(literal and figurative). Every time you think the central issue has been resolved, something new pops up to delay it. This manages to not frustrate the viewer, at least not to the point where we are unhappy with the movie... instead, we sympathize with the people(in spite of none of them being likable, without them being obnoxious to the point where you turn this off... they're interesting jerks, and that makes up for it) and their situation. The music by Ennio Morricone is excellent, and really fits the mood and tone. There is a lot of disturbing content and strong language, a little blood, nudity and sexuality in this. The DVD comes with a trailer(for this). I recommend this to any fan of those responsible for making it, and/or of filthy crime-drama-thrillers set in the middle of nowhere. 7/10

    Oliver Stone's film is full of quirky characters and does a U-turn from being a complicated little thriller into the realm of black comedy. Stone turned up the irony knob just a little too high in "U Turn"; no one wins and everyone meets an end that has its own ironic twist. Sean Penn plays Bobby Cooper, an unlikely tennis coach who is driving across Nevada with a bag of money. He needs to repay a debt to criminals who have cut off two of his fingers to expedite the repayment. He takes a U-turn off the main road when his prized, 1964 and a half Mustang Convertible bursts a radiator hose. He ends up in Superior, a dilapidated town 200 miles from Phoenix. Bobby leaves his car to be fixed at a repair shop on the edge of town run by the disgustingly dirty and dentally challenged Darrell played by Billy Bob Thornton. He meets Grace McKenna, Jennifer Lopez's character, who invites him home to help her hang curtains. When Grace's husband Jake, played by Nick Nolte, finds them together, he punches Bobby. Not your typical hero, Bobby falls to the floor whining. He can't take a trick. Robbed, beaten up, conned and used, he has little control over his life. Even his mother hangs up the phone when he rings her for help. Although Jake initially dismisses Bobby as a wimpy, pipsqueak, he offers him money to kill Grace, noting of Bobby's character, "You're a man without scruples," also telling him not to be offended because, "A man who's got no ethics is a free man." At first, Bobby refuses the offer, but after his fortunes plunge even further, he has second thoughts and agrees to kill Grace, leading to more double and triple crosses than it would be thought possible to cram into one movie. As Bobby becomes more involved with Grace, he discovers that she is also Jake's daughter  a U-turn into Roman Polanski territory. However, the surprise twist in Polanski's Chinatown is just more plot overkill in "U Turn". Eventually Bobby and Grace plan to get rid of Jake and take his money. Grace McKenna is very much sought after by men in this movie; an interest that proves fatal to all of them. However, Bobby Cooper is not quite besotted enough to want to share Jake's money with her, and they try everything to outmanoeuvre each other at every turn. The most ironic twist of all is reserved for Bobby when he is virtually the last man standing. No tricky camera angle is avoided in "U Turn", and like so much else in the film, this is overdone to the point that you almost expect every scene to be reflected in someone's sunglasses or viewed between the cameraman's legs. Despite its pretentiousness, the spectacular cast and the outrageous plot keep you going until the end  even if that ending is a bit of a letdown.

It's directed by Oliver Stone, a man with a history of making challenging cinema, and it has an ensemble cast of familiar actors. What's to go wrong? The story, as it turns out. U TURN falls down because the storyline is bloated and convoluted in equal measure. It meanders from place to place as the minutes and the hours gradually roll by, and you never get closer to any kind of truth or outcome. Come the umpteenth twist at the climax, you no longer care. The central crux of the film is a love triangle but it takes an age for this to go anywhere - THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE this isn't! Instead it's dragged out long beyond any intrigue or entertainment value it might have had. Much of the film involves quirky run-ins with various off-beat characters, but that doesn't make a film. And this time, Stone's direction feels pretentious and off-putting, like he's trying too hard and going overboard with the stylistics. Cast-wise, the main actors don't fair too well. Sean Penn is as unsympathetic as ever; I don't think I've ever seen him play a genuinely warm character. It doesn't bode well. Jennifer Lopez is youthful and refreshingly free of Hollywood-style cosmetic surgery, but her acting is limited. Nick Nolte just feels like he's trying too hard. The supporting stars are better: Billy Bob Thornton as the unrecognisable garage mechanic (shades of A SIMPLE PLAN's Jacob here), Jon Voight as a hobo, Powers Boothe as the sheriff, Joaquin Phoenix as a thug. In a better film, these characters would light up the screen; here, they seem mired in a bit of a mess and a missed opportunity. With a tightened screenplay and a great deal more focus, U TURN might have turned out halfway decent.

    Wow. What a weird movie. And from Oliver Stone no less. But what a cast! Penn, Nolte, Lopez, Boothe, Voight, Thorton, Phoenix, Danes...etc. I expected a little more intensity from Penn. he seemed to weak and easily manipulated. But his character seem to demanded him to be that way. Nolte as the dirty old man who is and has been basically "raping" his step-daughter Lopez, was OK. He seemed very thin back in 1997. maybe the role demanded it. Lopez as the "femme fatale" per say did OK also. Her scenes of making love with Penn and Nolte just did not seemed convincing at all. But still, she held her own with the these two "heavyweights" of the cinema. Boothe was once again doing yet another part as a sheriff. But I felt he was wasted as usual. he really didn't have much to do but just get killed. Phoenix as T.N.T was a treat. he seemed to remind me of a young Ray Liotta. Intense and psychotic at the same time. All for the "love" of a woman. He was one of the memorable characters of the this unusual film. Danes was wasted as his "girl" who really wants to leave this hick town and leave with Penn. Thus inciting Phoenix's jealousy big-time. Thorton for me stole the picture along with Phoenix. Thorton's 'Darrell' embodied the true redneck nightmare one can encounter in these small one-horse towns. He's scary and funny at the same time. A real complete treat of casting here for Billy Bob. Voight, I did not recognize at 1st! that's how much i was paying attention. But it's because I was focusing on the other characters in the film. Voight's blind guy was somewhat memorable once you know it's him under that makeup. Julie Hargerty's waitress was OK but her scenes were way to short to appreciate them, plus she was somewhat exemplified a little exaggerating as a typical redneck town waitress. Laurie Metcalf fared a little better as the Bus Station Clerk giving Penn a hard time for not having the exact amount to buy a ticket for the bus. But again her role was brief. good but brief. Abraham Benrubi as a biker/thief was also way too brief and was also wasted. he could have been an interesting character, but was blown away way to quickly. And by a little old lady no less! I would have had him cast as the Russian enforcer who shows up at the town looking for Penn. But alas I'm not the writer of the film. Shame. But the two stars that I have no idea why they were in the movie at all because their roles were so inconsequential, that any bit-extra actor could have done their brief cameos!! I'm talking about the great Bo Hopkins and the lovely Liv Tyler. Hopkins cameo just didn't make sense to me. He's in the diner when Penn encounters Phoenix and Danes for the 1st time, but he is just a simple customer in the background!? What the hell? I believe he didn't even have any lines!? I think Stone could have put him to better use as the sheriff of the town. And had Boothe as the mafia guy that Penn owed money to. But the worst cameo was Tyler's blink or you'll miss her as the customer behind Penn at the bus station wanting to buy a ticket and Metcalf's clerk is so distraught over Penn's emotional outburst, that she closes for the day leaving Tyler like "what the hell?" Exactly. what the hell Stone? What was the point of even having her in the bit scene? I guess we will never know. just like the point of this exaggerating pulp nonsense.

    Oliver stone is a bit of an acquired taste. He makes unique movies with visual flair only he can pull off. Some might say he favors style over substance, or that he is just a lunatic with money. The problem with this film however lies within the story. With a great ensemble cast, and stylish direction this movie could have been very enjoyable. Alas it failed to keep me interested with clich&eacute; after clich&eacute;, and honestly a story that was more interesting in words then moving pictures. In fact even though the cast was great all the characters were about as bland and predictable as possible. There's a wealthy old fart married to a hot young woman who hates him, there's a tuff and gritty sheriff, a dirty sneaky mechanic, and even a weak bully with tnt shaved into his hair and a big mouth. The story unfolds much like the characters, predictably. Guy owes money to some criminals, loses the money, gets offered some more money to kill some guys wife, the end. I figured with stone at the helm he could make this all worth while, and like I said it has everything I expected, except for something called a surprise. It was all so straight forward that even all the flashy camera work and wacky acting couldn't save it. If the movie did what it should have, kept me guessing, made me laugh, shock me, anything... it could have been great. It really just didn't do any of it. So despite being well made, well acted, and involving all sorts of talent, it just didn't leave a great impression, and it was almost a chore to sit through, and it really shouldn't have been. All in all its not the worst movie ever made, but its also not one i'll be watching over and over to absorb its brilliance. 4/10

    Oliver Stone directs this John Ridley screenplay entitled U Turn,which is adapted from Ridley's novel Stray Dogs.It features Sean Penn,Nick Nolte and Jennifer Lopez together with Joaquin Phoenix,Powers Boothe,Billy Bob Thornton,Claire Danes and Jon Voight.This film is a Southwestern noir tale about Bobby Cooper, a hotshot who is stuck in the tight confines of Superior, Arizona, when his car breaks down. His subsequent adventure is a meatball comedy which is loud, obnoxious, and violent, and stuffed with diffused light, a hot cast, and a no-fat Ennio Morricone score. A drifter eludes Las Vegas collection agents and arrives in a small town where he decides to linger after his car has a breakdown. Here he gets involved with the locals, including an unhappily married couple - a businessman and his seductive, femme-fatale wife. A trailer trash teen also approaches him in an effort to get away from her abusive boyfriend. Tensions in the town escalate, eventually leading to murder. The first 40 minutes or so are "fun" to a point. Penn is the perfect near-creep to root for, and as he wanders back into town after meeting Grace, the eclectic characters pile up. But soon it gets monotonous, tiring, and just plain ugly. And when incest and bloody fights begin, the fun is gone. If Penn weren't so solid an actor and able to be empathetic in the most morose situations, the movie would be not watchable at stretches. Lopez makes another good impression, but this is not a performance that stands out.While,Nolte is raspy and ill-looking. Before U Turn is over, you are already wondering if Oliver Stone will do something else, something more important, soon.Overall,it is a long and strange trip of a movie that is fun but aimless.

    Not as much as you'd think. It had a chance to work, but ultimately fizzled. I finally got around to watching U TURN, a full 15 years after it came out and sunk at the box office. You never even see it playing on cable, so I had to rent a copy. I just recently watched Stone's latest, SAVAGES, which I did like, but the American public apparently didn't. Anyway,I thought catch up on missed Oliver Stone movies, and this was first up. This movie had a nice look, the acting decent, and the story was OK (for the first hour anyway), but then the drag out, double-crosses (and "triple crosses") just seemed to go on forever. It should have been better, but I just can't figure out why it wasn't. I really wanted it to end soon after Nolte took the direct ax shot, but we still had another unseen plot line to develop with Boothe. Cameos by Julie Hagerty, Laurie Metcalf, and a blink & you'll miss her Liv Tyler were helpful, J. Phoenix always brings it, and the Russian guys were amusing. However, only Penn's scenes with Billy Bob really seemed to hit with some punch. I've always liked Thornton, even when he's sleep-walking through his blockbuster paycheck roles. Anyway, I say take a pass on U TURN, as it's too long and the payoff just ain't worth the wait.

    "U Turn" is often over the top, surreal and comical and Oliver Stone's style of direction plays along with these qualities perfectly. In everything he does, he favours excess over subtlety and utilises a variety of quick and often disconcerting visual techniques to create the hallucinogenic backdrop against which this twisted drama is played out. A collection of highly eccentric characters and some extraordinary performances from a star-studded cast also adds greatly to the enjoyment of watching this interesting treatment of a standard film noir plot (which bears a strong resemblance to "Red Rock West"). Bobby Cooper (Sean Penn)is a drifter who's driving to Las Vegas to pay off some gambling debts when his car's radiator hose blows and he has to make a detour to the town of Superior, Arizona to get a replacement fitted. Whilst his car is being repaired, Bobby goes into the town centre and almost straightaway, meets Grace McKenna (Jennifer Lopez). She's an attractive woman who needs assistance to carry some newly purchased drapes back to her home and Bobby is pleased to help. They start to get friendly and just as Bobby has his arms around her, Grace's husband Jake (Nick Nolte), arrives and punches Bobby to the ground. A little while later, after Bobby's left Grace's house, Jake offers him a significant amount of money to kill his wife because he's tired of her games. Bobby doesn't show any interest in the offer at that time but does later, after he loses all his money in strange circumstances after unintentionally getting caught up in a convenience store robbery. Before Bobby can go ahead with the planned murder, Grace persuades him to kill Jake so that they can steal her husband's money and go away together. They go ahead with their plan but a series of complications follow and eventually lead to a very tense and unpredictable end to the story. Bobby Cooper is a typical noir protagonist who suffers a misfortune that leads to a whole series of other problems, which all inevitably become more serious and dangerous than the last. This ex-tennis player with a gambling problem had already had two fingers cut off by the gangsters to whom he owed money before he arrived in Superior and the bad luck he suffered when his car broke down was exploited by the unscrupulous mechanic at the local garage who kept raising the cost of the job and threatening Bobby in various ways. Bobby's attraction to Grace got him caught up in a web of lust, murder and treachery and random misfortunes led to him losing his money and becoming trapped in this desert town with no means of escape. His awful predicament is then made even worse by his certain knowledge that the gangsters who want their money back know where he is and are coming to get him. Sean Penn is wonderfully intense and conveys his character's sheer desperation with immense power and conviction. There are also, however, very memorable performances by the rest of the cast who all look as if they're having a lot of fun in their roles as some of the most weird and devious people imaginable. Billy Bob Thornton stands out as the malevolent mechanic with a disgusting appearance and Nick Nolte is suitably gruff and repulsive as a man with an appalling past and no morals. Jon Voight makes a big impression as an allegedly blind Vietnam veteran who's a beggar with a penchant for making philosophical pronouncements and Jennifer Lopez is very good as the femme fatale. This neo-noir account of one man's nightmare contains so many elements that are recognisable from other film noirs that it ultimately becomes a glorious pastiche in which its many moments of dark humour act as a marvellous counterpoint to all the evil and violence that are prevalent throughout the whole story.

    What a wild ride this is with a sleazy, quirky assortment of characters. Billy Bob Thornton is a hoot as the gas station attendant. Jennifer Lopez is as hot as ever. But everybody is watching out for everybody in this "noire" classic. There are twists and turns galore and we never quite know what is around the corner. Expect the unexpected. It's got a great assortment of stars, who all play their different roles to perfection in this desert saga of intrigue, bloodlust and murder. Yes the bloodlust can get carried away at times, but it's still a great watch. It's also got humour and a great wrap-up at the end!

    U Turn is a very strange, weird and unusual film. I have recently finished watching it and I am really unsure on what to make of it. Urm, is it good? Not really. Is it bad? Not really. I just don't know what to say about it. The story is about Sean Penn's character, Bobby. He is driving through the desert on route to Vegas to pay off a gambling debt. A debt that has already cost him two fingers. Whilst driving, his radiator hose bursts and the closest place to get it fixed is a little town called Superior. He pulls into a typical looking garage for a deserted town such as this, and is greeted by a fat, hillbilly which is Billy Bob Thornton (who is actually pretty good). Bobby leaves the car in the mechanics hands and heads off to get a drink. Whilst walking through the town he meets Grace (Lopez) and an instant sexual attraction takes place. He ends up helping her put up drapes back at her home but when things heat up her husband (Nolte) arrives home and punches Bobby in the nose. Bobby then leaves the house but is tailed by Jake (J Lo's husband) and is offered money to kill his wife as he can't stand her. Bobby is unsure but when his bag of money is stolen in a grocery shop robbery, he realises he needs the money to pay off his debt or lose more of his fingers. However as he is about to kill her she offers him another proposition, kill her husband and steal his stash of cash he keeps under the floor boards. From here on Bobby must contemplate which route to take. He tries the easy option, to leave the town but the mechanics ridiculous charge for a radiator hose leaves Bobby's beloved Mustang in the mechanic's compound until he pays up. Bobby has no choice, but what will he do to get the money. The story does sound quite intriguing but everything just seems to fall in place far too easily. The characters don't force the plot twists, they just seem to randomly happen and Penn is left turning backwards and forward within this town. We also meet four other characters that seem to have very little to do with the plot other than to show the obscurity of this town. We have a Sheriff (Powers Boothe), a young couple (Claire Danes and Joaquin Phoenix), him always wanting a fight and her willing to run away with any man possible, and we are also given a blind tramp (Jon Voight) with plenty of wisdom to go around. All of these are just potential obstacles or aids and have very little usage. A debt collector comes into town at one point, on a mission to catch Bobby, but within thirty seconds he is arrested. No tension with him then as he is removed far too quickly. We find ourselves re-treading old ground as this film goes on. Each twenty minute segment just seems to repeat itself up until the strange climax. We are just shown how unlucky one man can be, and how strange this little town seems to be. The stars aren't bad with Penn giving a decent performance, I'm sure this wasn't a tough role for him. Lopez is typically her, not great and Nolte is just gruff. The star is perhaps Thornton in his unrecognizable role, it is definitely against type cast and I was fairly impressed with him. The direction isn't bad but the setting is very typical and something we've seen all too often. I was impressed with the editing and felt that there was a trippy feel to the entire film. Several camera movements and points of view shoots were stitched together well and gave a great feel to the movie. That still doesn't make it a good movie though. I was never really engaged with this film. Not once was I hooked and desperate to know what's going to happen next, in fact I didn't really care. The ending was poor and left you with a poor impression of this film. The theme seems to be about being lost and alone and the theme works as the whole way through that was exactly how I felt. 2 / 5 Tolli More reviews at: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com Follow @Tolli04

    The drifter Bobby just wants to get to Las Vegas and pay off his gambling debt. On the road in the Southwest, however, his car breaks down. He gets to the nearby small town of Superior, AZ, and he tries desperately to get back out. He runs into every kind of trouble conceivable there. Half the people he meets cause problems for him. The married couple of femme fatale Grace(an extremely hot Lopez at her most seductive, who does OK when asked to do anything more than be sultry and desirable, which she, of course, nails, pun intended) and Jake(Nolte, undeniably the creepiest presence in this, and he has serious competition for that award) both want him to kill their spouse. Darrell(Thornton in what may be his least appealing role... no, really; he's dumb, cheap, nasty and the oil on his face really gets to you) is the only chance nearby for getting the ride fixed back up, and he isn't exactly... well, all there. Blind Man Jon Voight is eccentric. And teenage Jenny(Danes, convincing as a proper little Lolita-wanna-be) falls in love with every new male face she sees with the same eagerness as her ill-tempered boyfriend Toby(Phoenix) is to beat up everyone she as much as talks to. The characters are memorable, quirky and distinct(even though there are so many of them, they all get a good amount of screen time, and we don't forget any of them). The majority of the acting is spot-on, and this makes solid use of the considerable talent featured. This is shot rather well. The editing will get on some people's nerves(it's very clearly a Stone film, and it's one of his greatest ones, as far as entertainment value goes), and it does arguably try a little hard, if it does succeed in building an atmosphere of unbearable heat, constant new obstacles, mistrust, violence and dirt(literal and figurative). Every time you think the central issue has been resolved, something new pops up to delay it. This manages to not frustrate the viewer, at least not to the point where we are unhappy with the movie... instead, we sympathize with the people(in spite of none of them being likable, without them being obnoxious to the point where you turn this off... they're interesting jerks, and that makes up for it) and their situation. The music by Ennio Morricone is excellent, and really fits the mood and tone. There is a lot of disturbing content and strong language, a little blood, nudity and sexuality in this. The DVD comes with a trailer(for this). I recommend this to any fan of those responsible for making it, and/or of filthy crime-drama-thrillers set in the middle of nowhere. 7/10

    Oliver Stone's film is full of quirky characters and does a U-turn from being a complicated little thriller into the realm of black comedy. Stone turned up the irony knob just a little too high in "U Turn"; no one wins and everyone meets an end that has its own ironic twist. Sean Penn plays Bobby Cooper, an unlikely tennis coach who is driving across Nevada with a bag of money. He needs to repay a debt to criminals who have cut off two of his fingers to expedite the repayment. He takes a U-turn off the main road when his prized, 1964 and a half Mustang Convertible bursts a radiator hose. He ends up in Superior, a dilapidated town 200 miles from Phoenix. Bobby leaves his car to be fixed at a repair shop on the edge of town run by the disgustingly dirty and dentally challenged Darrell played by Billy Bob Thornton. He meets Grace McKenna, Jennifer Lopez's character, who invites him home to help her hang curtains. When Grace's husband Jake, played by Nick Nolte, finds them together, he punches Bobby. Not your typical hero, Bobby falls to the floor whining. He can't take a trick. Robbed, beaten up, conned and used, he has little control over his life. Even his mother hangs up the phone when he rings her for help. Although Jake initially dismisses Bobby as a wimpy, pipsqueak, he offers him money to kill Grace, noting of Bobby's character, "You're a man without scruples," also telling him not to be offended because, "A man who's got no ethics is a free man." At first, Bobby refuses the offer, but after his fortunes plunge even further, he has second thoughts and agrees to kill Grace, leading to more double and triple crosses than it would be thought possible to cram into one movie. As Bobby becomes more involved with Grace, he discovers that she is also Jake's daughter  a U-turn into Roman Polanski territory. However, the surprise twist in Polanski's Chinatown is just more plot overkill in "U Turn". Eventually Bobby and Grace plan to get rid of Jake and take his money. Grace McKenna is very much sought after by men in this movie; an interest that proves fatal to all of them. However, Bobby Cooper is not quite besotted enough to want to share Jake's money with her, and they try everything to outmanoeuvre each other at every turn. The most ironic twist of all is reserved for Bobby when he is virtually the last man standing. No tricky camera angle is avoided in "U Turn", and like so much else in the film, this is overdone to the point that you almost expect every scene to be reflected in someone's sunglasses or viewed between the cameraman's legs. Despite its pretentiousness, the spectacular cast and the outrageous plot keep you going until the end  even if that ending is a bit of a letdown.

    U TURN has a great premise: a drifter shows up in an out-of-the-way town, only to fall foul of the town's weirdo inhabitants and finding himself caught up in intricate plots between various characters. It's directed by Oliver Stone, a man with a history of making challenging cinema, and it has an ensemble cast of familiar actors. What's to go wrong? The story, as it turns out. U TURN falls down because the storyline is bloated and convoluted in equal measure. It meanders from place to place as the minutes and the hours gradually roll by, and you never get closer to any kind of truth or outcome. Come the umpteenth twist at the climax, you no longer care. The central crux of the film is a love triangle but it takes an age for this to go anywhere - THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE this isn't! Instead it's dragged out long beyond any intrigue or entertainment value it might have had. Much of the film involves quirky run-ins with various off-beat characters, but that doesn't make a film. And this time, Stone's direction feels pretentious and off-putting, like he's trying too hard and going overboard with the stylistics. Cast-wise, the main actors don't fair too well. Sean Penn is as unsympathetic as ever; I don't think I've ever seen him play a genuinely warm character. It doesn't bode well. Jennifer Lopez is youthful and refreshingly free of Hollywood-style cosmetic surgery, but her acting is limited. Nick Nolte just feels like he's trying too hard. The supporting stars are better: Billy Bob Thornton as the unrecognisable garage mechanic (shades of A SIMPLE PLAN's Jacob here), Jon Voight as a hobo, Powers Boothe as the sheriff, Joaquin Phoenix as a thug. In a better film, these characters would light up the screen; here, they seem mired in a bit of a mess and a missed opportunity. With a tightened screenplay and a great deal more focus, U TURN might have turned out halfway decent.

    Wow. What a weird movie. And from Oliver Stone no less. But what a cast! Penn, Nolte, Lopez, Boothe, Voight, Thorton, Phoenix, Danes...etc. I expected a little more intensity from Penn. he seemed to weak and easily manipulated. But his character seem to demanded him to be that way. Nolte as the dirty old man who is and has been basically "raping" his step-daughter Lopez, was OK. He seemed very thin back in 1997. maybe the role demanded it. Lopez as the "femme fatale" per say did OK also. Her scenes of making love with Penn and Nolte just did not seemed convincing at all. But still, she held her own with the these two "heavyweights" of the cinema. Boothe was once again doing yet another part as a sheriff. But I felt he was wasted as usual. he really didn't have much to do but just get killed. Phoenix as T.N.T was a treat. he seemed to remind me of a young Ray Liotta. Intense and psychotic at the same time. All for the "love" of a woman. He was one of the memorable characters of the this unusual film. Danes was wasted as his "girl" who really wants to leave this hick town and leave with Penn. Thus inciting Phoenix's jealousy big-time. Thorton for me stole the picture along with Phoenix. Thorton's 'Darrell' embodied the true redneck nightmare one can encounter in these small one-horse towns. He's scary and funny at the same time. A real complete treat of casting here for Billy Bob. Voight, I did not recognize at 1st! that's how much i was paying attention. But it's because I was focusing on the other characters in the film. Voight's blind guy was somewhat memorable once you know it's him under that makeup. Julie Hargerty's waitress was OK but her scenes were way to short to appreciate them, plus she was somewhat exemplified a little exaggerating as a typical redneck town waitress. Laurie Metcalf fared a little better as the Bus Station Clerk giving Penn a hard time for not having the exact amount to buy a ticket for the bus. But again her role was brief. good but brief. Abraham Benrubi as a biker/thief was also way too brief and was also wasted. he could have been an interesting character, but was blown away way to quickly. And by a little old lady no less! I would have had him cast as the Russian enforcer who shows up at the town looking for Penn. But alas I'm not the writer of the film. Shame. But the two stars that I have no idea why they were in the movie at all because their roles were so inconsequential, that any bit-extra actor could have done their brief cameos!! I'm talking about the great Bo Hopkins and the lovely Liv Tyler. Hopkins cameo just didn't make sense to me. He's in the diner when Penn encounters Phoenix and Danes for the 1st time, but he is just a simple customer in the background!? What the hell? I believe he didn't even have any lines!? I think Stone could have put him to better use as the sheriff of the town. And had Boothe as the mafia guy that Penn owed money to. But the worst cameo was Tyler's blink or you'll miss her as the customer behind Penn at the bus station wanting to buy a ticket and Metcalf's clerk is so distraught over Penn's emotional outburst, that she closes for the day leaving Tyler like "what the hell?" Exactly. what the hell Stone? What was the point of even having her in the bit scene? I guess we will never know. just like the point of this exaggerating pulp nonsense.

    Oliver stone is a bit of an acquired taste. He makes unique movies with visual flair only he can pull off. Some might say he favors style over substance, or that he is just a lunatic with money. The problem with this film however lies within the story. With a great ensemble cast, and stylish direction this movie could have been very enjoyable. Alas it failed to keep me interested with clich&eacute; after clich&eacute;, and honestly a story that was more interesting in words then moving pictures. In fact even though the cast was great all the characters were about as bland and predictable as possible. There's a wealthy old fart married to a hot young woman who hates him, there's a tuff and gritty sheriff, a dirty sneaky mechanic, and even a weak bully with tnt shaved into his hair and a big mouth. The story unfolds much like the characters, predictably. Guy owes money to some criminals, loses the money, gets offered some more money to kill some guys wife, the end. I figured with stone at the helm he could make this all worth while, and like I said it has everything I expected, except for something called a surprise. It was all so straight forward that even all the flashy camera work and wacky acting couldn't save it. If the movie did what it should have, kept me guessing, made me laugh, shock me, anything... it could have been great. It really just didn't do any of it. So despite being well made, well acted, and involving all sorts of talent, it just didn't leave a great impression, and it was almost a chore to sit through, and it really shouldn't have been. All in all its not the worst movie ever made, but its also not one i'll be watching over and over to absorb its brilliance. 4/10

    Oliver Stone directs this John Ridley screenplay entitled U Turn,which is adapted from Ridley's novel Stray Dogs.It features Sean Penn,Nick Nolte and Jennifer Lopez together with Joaquin Phoenix,Powers Boothe,Billy Bob Thornton,Claire Danes and Jon Voight.This film is a Southwestern noir tale about Bobby Cooper, a hotshot who is stuck in the tight confines of Superior, Arizona, when his car breaks down. His subsequent adventure is a meatball comedy which is loud, obnoxious, and violent, and stuffed with diffused light, a hot cast, and a no-fat Ennio Morricone score. A drifter eludes Las Vegas collection agents and arrives in a small town where he decides to linger after his car has a breakdown. Here he gets involved with the locals, including an unhappily married couple - a businessman and his seductive, femme-fatale wife. A trailer trash teen also approaches him in an effort to get away from her abusive boyfriend. Tensions in the town escalate, eventually leading to murder. The first 40 minutes or so are "fun" to a point. Penn is the perfect near-creep to root for, and as he wanders back into town after meeting Grace, the eclectic characters pile up. But soon it gets monotonous, tiring, and just plain ugly. And when incest and bloody fights begin, the fun is gone. If Penn weren't so solid an actor and able to be empathetic in the most morose situations, the movie would be not watchable at stretches. Lopez makes another good impression, but this is not a performance that stands out.While,Nolte is raspy and ill-looking. Before U Turn is over, you are already wondering if Oliver Stone will do something else, something more important, soon.Overall,it is a long and strange trip of a movie that is fun but aimless.

    Not as much as you'd think. It had a chance to work, but ultimately fizzled. I finally got around to watching U TURN, a full 15 years after it came out and sunk at the box office. You never even see it playing on cable, so I had to rent a copy. I just recently watched Stone's latest, SAVAGES, which I did like, but the American public apparently didn't. Anyway,I thought catch up on missed Oliver Stone movies, and this was first up. This movie had a nice look, the acting decent, and the story was OK (for the first hour anyway), but then the drag out, double-crosses (and "triple crosses") just seemed to go on forever. It should have been better, but I just can't figure out why it wasn't. I really wanted it to end soon after Nolte took the direct ax shot, but we still had another unseen plot line to develop with Boothe. Cameos by Julie Hagerty, Laurie Metcalf, and a blink & you'll miss her Liv Tyler were helpful, J. Phoenix always brings it, and the Russian guys were amusing. However, only Penn's scenes with Billy Bob really seemed to hit with some punch. I've always liked Thornton, even when he's sleep-walking through his blockbuster paycheck roles. Anyway, I say take a pass on U TURN, as it's too long and the payoff just ain't worth the wait.

    "U Turn" is often over the top, surreal and comical and Oliver Stone's style of direction plays along with these qualities perfectly. In everything he does, he favours excess over subtlety and utilises a variety of quick and often disconcerting visual techniques to create the hallucinogenic backdrop against which this twisted drama is played out. A collection of highly eccentric characters and some extraordinary performances from a star-studded cast also adds greatly to the enjoyment of watching this interesting treatment of a standard film noir plot (which bears a strong resemblance to "Red Rock West"). Bobby Cooper (Sean Penn)is a drifter who's driving to Las Vegas to pay off some gambling debts when his car's radiator hose blows and he has to make a detour to the town of Superior, Arizona to get a replacement fitted. Whilst his car is being repaired, Bobby goes into the town centre and almost straightaway, meets Grace McKenna (Jennifer Lopez). She's an attractive woman who needs assistance to carry some newly purchased drapes back to her home and Bobby is pleased to help. They start to get friendly and just as Bobby has his arms around her, Grace's husband Jake (Nick Nolte), arrives and punches Bobby to the ground. A little while later, after Bobby's left Grace's house, Jake offers him a significant amount of money to kill his wife because he's tired of her games. Bobby doesn't show any interest in the offer at that time but does later, after he loses all his money in strange circumstances after unintentionally getting caught up in a convenience store robbery. Before Bobby can go ahead with the planned murder, Grace persuades him to kill Jake so that they can steal her husband's money and go away together. They go ahead with their plan but a series of complications follow and eventually lead to a very tense and unpredictable end to the story. Bobby Cooper is a typical noir protagonist who suffers a misfortune that leads to a whole series of other problems, which all inevitably become more serious and dangerous than the last. This ex-tennis player with a gambling problem had already had two fingers cut off by the gangsters to whom he owed money before he arrived in Superior and the bad luck he suffered when his car broke down was exploited by the unscrupulous mechanic at the local garage who kept raising the cost of the job and threatening Bobby in various ways. Bobby's attraction to Grace got him caught up in a web of lust, murder and treachery and random misfortunes led to him losing his money and becoming trapped in this desert town with no means of escape. His awful predicament is then made even worse by his certain knowledge that the gangsters who want their money back know where he is and are coming to get him. Sean Penn is wonderfully intense and conveys his character's sheer desperation with immense power and conviction. There are also, however, very memorable performances by the rest of the cast who all look as if they're having a lot of fun in their roles as some of the most weird and devious people imaginable. Billy Bob Thornton stands out as the malevolent mechanic with a disgusting appearance and Nick Nolte is suitably gruff and repulsive as a man with an appalling past and no morals. Jon Voight makes a big impression as an allegedly blind Vietnam veteran who's a beggar with a penchant for making philosophical pronouncements and Jennifer Lopez is very good as the femme fatale. This neo-noir account of one man's nightmare contains so many elements that are recognisable from other film noirs that it ultimately becomes a glorious pastiche in which its many moments of dark humour act as a marvellous counterpoint to all the evil and violence that are prevalent throughout the whole story.

    What a wild ride this is with a sleazy, quirky assortment of characters. Billy Bob Thornton is a hoot as the gas station attendant. Jennifer Lopez is as hot as ever. But everybody is watching out for everybody in this "noire" classic. There are twists and turns galore and we never quite know what is around the corner. Expect the unexpected. It's got a great assortment of stars, who all play their different roles to perfection in this desert saga of intrigue, bloodlust and murder. Yes the bloodlust can get carried away at times, but it's still a great watch. It's also got humour and a great wrap-up at the end!

    U Turn is a very strange, weird and unusual film. I have recently finished watching it and I am really unsure on what to make of it. Urm, is it good? Not really. Is it bad? Not really. I just don't know what to say about it. The story is about Sean Penn's character, Bobby. He is driving through the desert on route to Vegas to pay off a gambling debt. A debt that has already cost him two fingers. Whilst driving, his radiator hose bursts and the closest place to get it fixed is a little town called Superior. He pulls into a typical looking garage for a deserted town such as this, and is greeted by a fat, hillbilly which is Billy Bob Thornton (who is actually pretty good). Bobby leaves the car in the mechanics hands and heads off to get a drink. Whilst walking through the town he meets Grace (Lopez) and an instant sexual attraction takes place. He ends up helping her put up drapes back at her home but when things heat up her husband (Nolte) arrives home and punches Bobby in the nose. Bobby then leaves the house but is tailed by Jake (J Lo's husband) and is offered money to kill his wife as he can't stand her. Bobby is unsure but when his bag of money is stolen in a grocery shop robbery, he realises he needs the money to pay off his debt or lose more of his fingers. However as he is about to kill her she offers him another proposition, kill her husband and steal his stash of cash he keeps under the floor boards. From here on Bobby must contemplate which route to take. He tries the easy option, to leave the town but the mechanics ridiculous charge for a radiator hose leaves Bobby's beloved Mustang in the mechanic's compound until he pays up. Bobby has no choice, but what will he do to get the money. The story does sound quite intriguing but everything just seems to fall in place far too easily. The characters don't force the plot twists, they just seem to randomly happen and Penn is left turning backwards and forward within this town. We also meet four other characters that seem to have very little to do with the plot other than to show the obscurity of this town. We have a Sheriff (Powers Boothe), a young couple (Claire Danes and Joaquin Phoenix), him always wanting a fight and her willing to run away with any man possible, and we are also given a blind tramp (Jon Voight) with plenty of wisdom to go around. All of these are just potential obstacles or aids and have very little usage. A debt collector comes into town at one point, on a mission to catch Bobby, but within thirty seconds he is arrested. No tension with him then as he is removed far too quickly. We find ourselves re-treading old ground as this film goes on. Each twenty minute segment just seems to repeat itself up until the strange climax. We are just shown how unlucky one man can be, and how strange this little town seems to be. The stars aren't bad with Penn giving a decent performance, I'm sure this wasn't a tough role for him. Lopez is typically her, not great and Nolte is just gruff. The star is perhaps Thornton in his unrecognizable role, it is definitely against type cast and I was fairly impressed with him. The direction isn't bad but the setting is very typical and something we've seen all too often. I was impressed with the editing and felt that there was a trippy feel to the entire film. Several camera movements and points of view shoots were stitched together well and gave a great feel to the movie. That still doesn't make it a good movie though. I was never really engaged with this film. Not once was I hooked and desperate to know what's going to happen next, in fact I didn't really care. The ending was poor and left you with a poor impression of this film. The theme seems to be about being lost and alone and the theme works as the whole way through that was exactly how I felt. 2 / 5 Tolli More reviews at: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com Follow @Tolli04

    The drifter Bobby just wants to get to Las Vegas and pay off his gambling debt. On the road in the Southwest, however, his car breaks down. He gets to the nearby small town of Superior, AZ, and he tries desperately to get back out. He runs into every kind of trouble conceivable there. Half the people he meets cause problems for him. The married couple of femme fatale Grace(an extremely hot Lopez at her most seductive, who does OK when asked to do anything more than be sultry and desirable, which she, of course, nails, pun intended) and Jake(Nolte, undeniably the creepiest presence in this, and he has serious competition for that award) both want him to kill their spouse. Darrell(Thornton in what may be his least appealing role... no, really; he's dumb, cheap, nasty and the oil on his face really gets to you) is the only chance nearby for getting the ride fixed back up, and he isn't exactly... well, all there. Blind Man Jon Voight is eccentric. And teenage Jenny(Danes, convincing as a proper little Lolita-wanna-be) falls in love with every new male face she sees with the same eagerness as her ill-tempered boyfriend Toby(Phoenix) is to beat up everyone she as much as talks to. The characters are memorable, quirky and distinct(even though there are so many of them, they all get a good amount of screen time, and we don't forget any of them). The majority of the acting is spot-on, and this makes solid use of the considerable talent featured. This is shot rather well. The editing will get on some people's nerves(it's very clearly a Stone film, and it's one of his greatest ones, as far as entertainment value goes), and it does arguably try a little hard, if it does succeed in building an atmosphere of unbearable heat, constant new obstacles, mistrust, violence and dirt(literal and figurative). Every time you think the central issue has been resolved, something new pops up to delay it. This manages to not frustrate the viewer, at least not to the point where we are unhappy with the movie... instead, we sympathize with the people(in spite of none of them being likable, without them being obnoxious to the point where you turn this off... they're interesting jerks, and that makes up for it) and their situation. The music by Ennio Morricone is excellent, and really fits the mood and tone. There is a lot of disturbing content and strong language, a little blood, nudity and sexuality in this. The DVD comes with a trailer(for this). I recommend this to any fan of those responsible for making it, and/or of filthy crime-drama-thrillers set in the middle of nowhere. 7/10

    Oliver Stone's film is full of quirky characters and does a U-turn from being a complicated little thriller into the realm of black comedy. Stone turned up the irony knob just a little too high in "U Turn"; no one wins and everyone meets an end that has its own ironic twist. Sean Penn plays Bobby Cooper, an unlikely tennis coach who is driving across Nevada with a bag of money. He needs to repay a debt to criminals who have cut off two of his fingers to expedite the repayment. He takes a U-turn off the main road when his prized, 1964 and a half Mustang Convertible bursts a radiator hose. He ends up in Superior, a dilapidated town 200 miles from Phoenix. Bobby leaves his car to be fixed at a repair shop on the edge of town run by the disgustingly dirty and dentally challenged Darrell played by Billy Bob Thornton. He meets Grace McKenna, Jennifer Lopez's character, who invites him home to help her hang curtains. When Grace's husband Jake, played by Nick Nolte, finds them together, he punches Bobby. Not your typical hero, Bobby falls to the floor whining. He can't take a trick. Robbed, beaten up, conned and used, he has little control over his life. Even his mother hangs up the phone when he rings her for help. Although Jake initially dismisses Bobby as a wimpy, pipsqueak, he offers him money to kill Grace, noting of Bobby's character, "You're a man without scruples," also telling him not to be offended because, "A man who's got no ethics is a free man." At first, Bobby refuses the offer, but after his fortunes plunge even further, he has second thoughts and agrees to kill Grace, leading to more double and triple crosses than it would be thought possible to cram into one movie. As Bobby becomes more involved with Grace, he discovers that she is also Jake's daughter  a U-turn into Roman Polanski territory. However, the surprise twist in Polanski's Chinatown is just more plot overkill in "U Turn". Eventually Bobby and Grace plan to get rid of Jake and take his money. Grace McKenna is very much sought after by men in this movie; an interest that proves fatal to all of them. However, Bobby Cooper is not quite besotted enough to want to share Jake's money with her, and they try everything to outmanoeuvre each other at every turn. The most ironic twist of all is reserved for Bobby when he is virtually the last man standing. No tricky camera angle is avoided in "U Turn", and like so much else in the film, this is overdone to the point that you almost expect every scene to be reflected in someone's sunglasses or viewed between the cameraman's legs. Despite its pretentiousness, the spectacular cast and the outrageous plot keep you going until the end  even if that ending is a bit of a letdown.

    U TURN has a great premise: a drifter shows up in an out-of-the-way town, only to fall foul of the town's weirdo inhabitants and finding himself caught up in intricate plots between various characters. It's directed by Oliver Stone, a man with a history of making challenging cinema, and it has an ensemble cast of familiar actors. What's to go wrong? The story, as it turns out. U TURN falls down because the storyline is bloated and convoluted in equal measure. It meanders from place to place as the minutes and the hours gradually roll by, and you never get closer to any kind of truth or outcome. Come the umpteenth twist at the climax, you no longer care. The central crux of the film is a love triangle but it takes an age for this to go anywhere - THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE this isn't! Instead it's dragged out long beyond any intrigue or entertainment value it might have had. Much of the film involves quirky run-ins with various off-beat characters, but that doesn't make a film. And this time, Stone's direction feels pretentious and off-putting, like he's trying too hard and going overboard with the stylistics. Cast-wise, the main actors don't fair too well. Sean Penn is as unsympathetic as ever; I don't think I've ever seen him play a genuinely warm character. It doesn't bode well. Jennifer Lopez is youthful and refreshingly free of Hollywood-style cosmetic surgery, but her acting is limited. Nick Nolte just feels like he's trying too hard. The supporting stars are better: Billy Bob Thornton as the unrecognisable garage mechanic (shades of A SIMPLE PLAN's Jacob here), Jon Voight as a hobo, Powers Boothe as the sheriff, Joaquin Phoenix as a thug. In a better film, these characters would light up the screen; here, they seem mired in a bit of a mess and a missed opportunity. With a tightened screenplay and a great deal more focus, U TURN might have turned out halfway decent.

    Wow. What a weird movie. And from Oliver Stone no less. But what a cast! Penn, Nolte, Lopez, Boothe, Voight, Thorton, Phoenix, Danes...etc. I expected a little more intensity from Penn. he seemed to weak and easily manipulated. But his character seem to demanded him to be that way. Nolte as the dirty old man who is and has been basically "raping" his step-daughter Lopez, was OK. He seemed very thin back in 1997. maybe the role demanded it. Lopez as the "femme fatale" per say did OK also. Her scenes of making love with Penn and Nolte just did not seemed convincing at all. But still, she held her own with the these two "heavyweights" of the cinema. Boothe was once again doing yet another part as a sheriff. But I felt he was wasted as usual. he really didn't have much to do but just get killed. Phoenix as T.N.T was a treat. he seemed to remind me of a young Ray Liotta. Intense and psychotic at the same time. All for the "love" of a woman. He was one of the memorable characters of the this unusual film. Danes was wasted as his "girl" who really wants to leave this hick town and leave with Penn. Thus inciting Phoenix's jealousy big-time. Thorton for me stole the picture along with Phoenix. Thorton's 'Darrell' embodied the true redneck nightmare one can encounter in these small one-horse towns. He's scary and funny at the same time. A real complete treat of casting here for Billy Bob. Voight, I did not recognize at 1st! that's how much i was paying attention. But it's because I was focusing on the other characters in the film. Voight's blind guy was somewhat memorable once you know it's him under that makeup. Julie Hargerty's waitress was OK but her scenes were way to short to appreciate them, plus she was somewhat exemplified a little exaggerating as a typical redneck town waitress. Laurie Metcalf fared a little better as the Bus Station Clerk giving Penn a hard time for not having the exact amount to buy a ticket for the bus. But again her role was brief. good but brief. Abraham Benrubi as a biker/thief was also way too brief and was also wasted. he could have been an interesting character, but was blown away way to quickly. And by a little old lady no less! I would have had him cast as the Russian enforcer who shows up at the town looking for Penn. But alas I'm not the writer of the film. Shame. But the two stars that I have no idea why they were in the movie at all because their roles were so inconsequential, that any bit-extra actor could have done their brief cameos!! I'm talking about the great Bo Hopkins and the lovely Liv Tyler. Hopkins cameo just didn't make sense to me. He's in the diner when Penn encounters Phoenix and Danes for the 1st time, but he is just a simple customer in the background!? What the hell? I believe he didn't even have any lines!? I think Stone could have put him to better use as the sheriff of the town. And had Boothe as the mafia guy that Penn owed money to. But the worst cameo was Tyler's blink or you'll miss her as the customer behind Penn at the bus station wanting to buy a ticket and Metcalf's clerk is so distraught over Penn's emotional outburst, that she closes for the day leaving Tyler like "what the hell?" Exactly. what the hell Stone? What was the point of even having her in the bit scene? I guess we will never know. just like the point of this exaggerating pulp nonsense.

    Oliver stone is a bit of an acquired taste. He makes unique movies with visual flair only he can pull off. Some might say he favors style over substance, or that he is just a lunatic with money. The problem with this film however lies within the story. With a great ensemble cast, and stylish direction this movie could have been very enjoyable. Alas it failed to keep me interested with clich&eacute; after clich&eacute;, and honestly a story that was more interesting in words then moving pictures. In fact even though the cast was great all the characters were about as bland and predictable as possible. There's a wealthy old fart married to a hot young woman who hates him, there's a tuff and gritty sheriff, a dirty sneaky mechanic, and even a weak bully with tnt shaved into his hair and a big mouth. The story unfolds much like the characters, predictably. Guy owes money to some criminals, loses the money, gets offered some more money to kill some guys wife, the end. I figured with stone at the helm he could make this all worth while, and like I said it has everything I expected, except for something called a surprise. It was all so straight forward that even all the flashy camera work and wacky acting couldn't save it. If the movie did what it should have, kept me guessing, made me laugh, shock me, anything... it could have been great. It really just didn't do any of it. So despite being well made, well acted, and involving all sorts of talent, it just didn't leave a great impression, and it was almost a chore to sit through, and it really shouldn't have been. All in all its not the worst movie ever made, but its also not one i'll be watching over and over to absorb its brilliance. 4/10

    "U Turn" is often over the top, surreal and comical and Oliver Stone's style of direction plays along with these qualities perfectly. In everything he does, he favours excess over subtlety and utilises a variety of quick and often disconcerting visual techniques to create the hallucinogenic backdrop against which this twisted drama is played out. A collection of highly eccentric characters and some extraordinary performances from a star-studded cast also adds greatly to the enjoyment of watching this interesting treatment of a standard film noir plot (which bears a strong resemblance to "Red Rock West"). Bobby Cooper (Sean Penn)is a drifter who's driving to Las Vegas to pay off some gambling debts when his car's radiator hose blows and he has to make a detour to the town of Superior, Arizona to get a replacement fitted. Whilst his car is being repaired, Bobby goes into the town centre and almost straightaway, meets Grace McKenna (Jennifer Lopez). She's an attractive woman who needs assistance to carry some newly purchased drapes back to her home and Bobby is pleased to help. They start to get friendly and just as Bobby has his arms around her, Grace's husband Jake (Nick Nolte), arrives and punches Bobby to the ground. A little while later, after Bobby's left Grace's house, Jake offers him a significant amount of money to kill his wife because he's tired of her games. Bobby doesn't show any interest in the offer at that time but does later, after he loses all his money in strange circumstances after unintentionally getting caught up in a convenience store robbery. Before Bobby can go ahead with the planned murder, Grace persuades him to kill Jake so that they can steal her husband's money and go away together. They go ahead with their plan but a series of complications follow and eventually lead to a very tense and unpredictable end to the story. Bobby Cooper is a typical noir protagonist who suffers a misfortune that leads to a whole series of other problems, which all inevitably become more serious and dangerous than the last. This ex-tennis player with a gambling problem had already had two fingers cut off by the gangsters to whom he owed money before he arrived in Superior and the bad luck he suffered when his car broke down was exploited by the unscrupulous mechanic at the local garage who kept raising the cost of the job and threatening Bobby in various ways. Bobby's attraction to Grace got him caught up in a web of lust, murder and treachery and random misfortunes led to him losing his money and becoming trapped in this desert town with no means of escape. His awful predicament is then made even worse by his certain knowledge that the gangsters who want their money back know where he is and are coming to get him. Sean Penn is wonderfully intense and conveys his character's sheer desperation with immense power and conviction. There are also, however, very memorable performances by the rest of the cast who all look as if they're having a lot of fun in their roles as some of the most weird and devious people imaginable. Billy Bob Thornton stands out as the malevolent mechanic with a disgusting appearance and Nick Nolte is suitably gruff and repulsive as a man with an appalling past and no morals. Jon Voight makes a big impression as an allegedly blind Vietnam veteran who's a beggar with a penchant for making philosophical pronouncements and Jennifer Lopez is very good as the femme fatale. This neo-noir account of one man's nightmare contains so many elements that are recognisable from other film noirs that it ultimately becomes a glorious pastiche in which its many moments of dark humour act as a marvellous counterpoint to all the evil and violence that are prevalent throughout the whole story.

    What a wild ride this is with a sleazy, quirky assortment of characters. Billy Bob Thornton is a hoot as the gas station attendant. Jennifer Lopez is as hot as ever. But everybody is watching out for everybody in this "noire" classic. There are twists and turns galore and we never quite know what is around the corner. Expect the unexpected. It's got a great assortment of stars, who all play their different roles to perfection in this desert saga of intrigue, bloodlust and murder. Yes the bloodlust can get carried away at times, but it's still a great watch. It's also got humour and a great wrap-up at the end!

    U Turn is a very strange, weird and unusual film. I have recently finished watching it and I am really unsure on what to make of it. Urm, is it good? Not really. Is it bad? Not really. I just don't know what to say about it. The story is about Sean Penn's character, Bobby. He is driving through the desert on route to Vegas to pay off a gambling debt. A debt that has already cost him two fingers. Whilst driving, his radiator hose bursts and the closest place to get it fixed is a little town called Superior. He pulls into a typical looking garage for a deserted town such as this, and is greeted by a fat, hillbilly which is Billy Bob Thornton (who is actually pretty good). Bobby leaves the car in the mechanics hands and heads off to get a drink. Whilst walking through the town he meets Grace (Lopez) and an instant sexual attraction takes place. He ends up helping her put up drapes back at her home but when things heat up her husband (Nolte) arrives home and punches Bobby in the nose. Bobby then leaves the house but is tailed by Jake (J Lo's husband) and is offered money to kill his wife as he can't stand her. Bobby is unsure but when his bag of money is stolen in a grocery shop robbery, he realises he needs the money to pay off his debt or lose more of his fingers. However as he is about to kill her she offers him another proposition, kill her husband and steal his stash of cash he keeps under the floor boards. From here on Bobby must contemplate which route to take. He tries the easy option, to leave the town but the mechanics ridiculous charge for a radiator hose leaves Bobby's beloved Mustang in the mechanic's compound until he pays up. Bobby has no choice, but what will he do to get the money. The story does sound quite intriguing but everything just seems to fall in place far too easily. The characters don't force the plot twists, they just seem to randomly happen and Penn is left turning backwards and forward within this town. We also meet four other characters that seem to have very little to do with the plot other than to show the obscurity of this town. We have a Sheriff (Powers Boothe), a young couple (Claire Danes and Joaquin Phoenix), him always wanting a fight and her willing to run away with any man possible, and we are also given a blind tramp (Jon Voight) with plenty of wisdom to go around. All of these are just potential obstacles or aids and have very little usage. A debt collector comes into town at one point, on a mission to catch Bobby, but within thirty seconds he is arrested. No tension with him then as he is removed far too quickly. We find ourselves re-treading old ground as this film goes on. Each twenty minute segment just seems to repeat itself up until the strange climax. We are just shown how unlucky one man can be, and how strange this little town seems to be. The stars aren't bad with Penn giving a decent performance, I'm sure this wasn't a tough role for him. Lopez is typically her, not great and Nolte is just gruff. The star is perhaps Thornton in his unrecognizable role, it is definitely against type cast and I was fairly impressed with him. The direction isn't bad but the setting is very typical and something we've seen all too often. I was impressed with the editing and felt that there was a trippy feel to the entire film. Several camera movements and points of view shoots were stitched together well and gave a great feel to the movie. That still doesn't make it a good movie though. I was never really engaged with this film. Not once was I hooked and desperate to know what's going to happen next, in fact I didn't really care. The ending was poor and left you with a poor impression of this film. The theme seems to be about being lost and alone and the theme works as the whole way through that was exactly how I felt. 2 / 5 Tolli More reviews at: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com Follow @Tolli04

    The drifter Bobby just wants to get to Las Vegas and pay off his gambling debt. On the road in the Southwest, however, his car breaks down. He gets to the nearby small town of Superior, AZ, and he tries desperately to get back out. He runs into every kind of trouble conceivable there. Half the people he meets cause problems for him. The married couple of femme fatale Grace(an extremely hot Lopez at her most seductive, who does OK when asked to do anything more than be sultry and desirable, which she, of course, nails, pun intended) and Jake(Nolte, undeniably the creepiest presence in this, and he has serious competition for that award) both want him to kill their spouse. Darrell(Thornton in what may be his least appealing role... no, really; he's dumb, cheap, nasty and the oil on his face really gets to you) is the only chance nearby for getting the ride fixed back up, and he isn't exactly... well, all there. Blind Man Jon Voight is eccentric. And teenage Jenny(Danes, convincing as a proper little Lolita-wanna-be) falls in love with every new male face she sees with the same eagerness as her ill-tempered boyfriend Toby(Phoenix) is to beat up everyone she as much as talks to. The characters are memorable, quirky and distinct(even though there are so many of them, they all get a good amount of screen time, and we don't forget any of them). The majority of the acting is spot-on, and this makes solid use of the considerable talent featured. This is shot rather well. The editing will get on some people's nerves(it's very clearly a Stone film, and it's one of his greatest ones, as far as entertainment value goes), and it does arguably try a little hard, if it does succeed in building an atmosphere of unbearable heat, constant new obstacles, mistrust, violence and dirt(literal and figurative). Every time you think the central issue has been resolved, something new pops up to delay it. This manages to not frustrate the viewer, at least not to the point where we are unhappy with the movie... instead, we sympathize with the people(in spite of none of them being likable, without them being obnoxious to the point where you turn this off... they're interesting jerks, and that makes up for it) and their situation. The music by Ennio Morricone is excellent, and really fits the mood and tone. There is a lot of disturbing content and strong language, a little blood, nudity and sexuality in this. The DVD comes with a trailer(for this). I recommend this to any fan of those responsible for making it, and/or of filthy crime-drama-thrillers set in the middle of nowhere. 7/10

    Oliver Stone's film is full of quirky characters and does a U-turn from being a complicated little thriller into the realm of black comedy. Stone turned up the irony knob just a little too high in "U Turn"; no one wins and everyone meets an end that has its own ironic twist. Sean Penn plays Bobby Cooper, an unlikely tennis coach who is driving across Nevada with a bag of money. He needs to repay a debt to criminals who have cut off two of his fingers to expedite the repayment. He takes a U-turn off the main road when his prized, 1964 and a half Mustang Convertible bursts a radiator hose. He ends up in Superior, a dilapidated town 200 miles from Phoenix. Bobby leaves his car to be fixed at a repair shop on the edge of town run by the disgustingly dirty and dentally challenged Darrell played by Billy Bob Thornton. He meets Grace McKenna, Jennifer Lopez's character, who invites him home to help her hang curtains. When Grace's husband Jake, played by Nick Nolte, finds them together, he punches Bobby. Not your typical hero, Bobby falls to the floor whining. He can't take a trick. Robbed, beaten up, conned and used, he has little control over his life. Even his mother hangs up the phone when he rings her for help. Although Jake initially dismisses Bobby as a wimpy, pipsqueak, he offers him money to kill Grace, noting of Bobby's character, "You're a man without scruples," also telling him not to be offended because, "A man who's got no ethics is a free man." At first, Bobby refuses the offer, but after his fortunes plunge even further, he has second thoughts and agrees to kill Grace, leading to more double and triple crosses than it would be thought possible to cram into one movie. As Bobby becomes more involved with Grace, he discovers that she is also Jake's daughter  a U-turn into Roman Polanski territory. However, the surprise twist in Polanski's Chinatown is just more plot overkill in "U Turn". Eventually Bobby and Grace plan to get rid of Jake and take his money. Grace McKenna is very much sought after by men in this movie; an interest that proves fatal to all of them. However, Bobby Cooper is not quite besotted enough to want to share Jake's money with her, and they try everything to outmanoeuvre each other at every turn. The most ironic twist of all is reserved for Bobby when he is virtually the last man standing. No tricky camera angle is avoided in "U Turn", and like so much else in the film, this is overdone to the point that you almost expect every scene to be reflected in someone's sunglasses or viewed between the cameraman's legs. Despite its pretentiousness, the spectacular cast and the outrageous plot keep you going until the end  even if that ending is a bit of a letdown.

    U TURN has a great premise: a drifter shows up in an out-of-the-way town, only to fall foul of the town's weirdo inhabitants and finding himself caught up in intricate plots between various characters. It's directed by Oliver Stone, a man with a history of making challenging cinema, and it has an ensemble cast of familiar actors. What's to go wrong? The story, as it turns out. U TURN falls down because the storyline is bloated and convoluted in equal measure. It meanders from place to place as the minutes and the hours gradually roll by, and you never get closer to any kind of truth or outcome. Come the umpteenth twist at the climax, you no longer care. The central crux of the film is a love triangle but it takes an age for this to go anywhere - THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE this isn't! Instead it's dragged out long beyond any intrigue or entertainment value it might have had. Much of the film involves quirky run-ins with various off-beat characters, but that doesn't make a film. And this time, Stone's direction feels pretentious and off-putting, like he's trying too hard and going overboard with the stylistics. Cast-wise, the main actors don't fair too well. Sean Penn is as unsympathetic as ever; I don't think I've ever seen him play a genuinely warm character. It doesn't bode well. Jennifer Lopez is youthful and refreshingly free of Hollywood-style cosmetic surgery, but her acting is limited. Nick Nolte just feels like he's trying too hard. The supporting stars are better: Billy Bob Thornton as the unrecognisable garage mechanic (shades of A SIMPLE PLAN's Jacob here), Jon Voight as a hobo, Powers Boothe as the sheriff, Joaquin Phoenix as a thug. In a better film, these characters would light up the screen; here, they seem mired in a bit of a mess and a missed opportunity. With a tightened screenplay and a great deal more focus, U TURN might have turned out halfway decent.

    Wow. What a weird movie. And from Oliver Stone no less. But what a cast! Penn, Nolte, Lopez, Boothe, Voight, Thorton, Phoenix, Danes...etc. I expected a little more intensity from Penn. he seemed to weak and easily manipulated. But his character seem to demanded him to be that way. Nolte as the dirty old man who is and has been basically "raping" his step-daughter Lopez, was OK. He seemed very thin back in 1997. maybe the role demanded it. Lopez as the "femme fatale" per say did OK also. Her scenes of making love with Penn and Nolte just did not seemed convincing at all. But still, she held her own with the these two "heavyweights" of the cinema. Boothe was once again doing yet another part as a sheriff. But I felt he was wasted as usual. he really didn't have much to do but just get killed. Phoenix as T.N.T was a treat. he seemed to remind me of a young Ray Liotta. Intense and psychotic at the same time. All for the "love" of a woman. He was one of the memorable characters of the this unusual film. Danes was wasted as his "girl" who really wants to leave this hick town and leave with Penn. Thus inciting Phoenix's jealousy big-time. Thorton for me stole the picture along with Phoenix. Thorton's 'Darrell' embodied the true redneck nightmare one can encounter in these small one-horse towns. He's scary and funny at the same time. A real complete treat of casting here for Billy Bob. Voight, I did not recognize at 1st! that's how much i was paying attention. But it's because I was focusing on the other characters in the film. Voight's blind guy was somewhat memorable once you know it's him under that makeup. Julie Hargerty's waitress was OK but her scenes were way to short to appreciate them, plus she was somewhat exemplified a little exaggerating as a typical redneck town waitress. Laurie Metcalf fared a little better as the Bus Station Clerk giving Penn a hard time for not having the exact amount to buy a ticket for the bus. But again her role was brief. good but brief. Abraham Benrubi as a biker/thief was also way too brief and was also wasted. he could have been an interesting character, but was blown away way to quickly. And by a little old lady no less! I would have had him cast as the Russian enforcer who shows up at the town looking for Penn. But alas I'm not the writer of the film. Shame. But the two stars that I have no idea why they were in the movie at all because their roles were so inconsequential, that any bit-extra actor could have done their brief cameos!! I'm talking about the great Bo Hopkins and the lovely Liv Tyler. Hopkins cameo just didn't make sense to me. He's in the diner when Penn encounters Phoenix and Danes for the 1st time, but he is just a simple customer in the background!? What the hell? I believe he didn't even have any lines!? I think Stone could have put him to better use as the sheriff of the town. And had Boothe as the mafia guy that Penn owed money to. But the worst cameo was Tyler's blink or you'll miss her as the customer behind Penn at the bus station wanting to buy a ticket and Metcalf's clerk is so distraught over Penn's emotional outburst, that she closes for the day leaving Tyler like "what the hell?" Exactly. what the hell Stone? What was the point of even having her in the bit scene? I guess we will never know. just like the point of this exaggerating pulp nonsense.

    Oliver stone is a bit of an acquired taste. He makes unique movies with visual flair only he can pull off. Some might say he favors style over substance, or that he is just a lunatic with money. The problem with this film however lies within the story. With a great ensemble cast, and stylish direction this movie could have been very enjoyable. Alas it failed to keep me interested with clich&eacute; after clich&eacute;, and honestly a story that was more interesting in words then moving pictures. In fact even though the cast was great all the characters were about as bland and predictable as possible. There's a wealthy old fart married to a hot young woman who hates him, there's a tuff and gritty sheriff, a dirty sneaky mechanic, and even a weak bully with tnt shaved into his hair and a big mouth. The story unfolds much like the characters, predictably. Guy owes money to some criminals, loses the money, gets offered some more money to kill some guys wife, the end. I figured with stone at the helm he could make this all worth while, and like I said it has everything I expected, except for something called a surprise. It was all so straight forward that even all the flashy camera work and wacky acting couldn't save it. If the movie did what it should have, kept me guessing, made me laugh, shock me, anything... it could have been great. It really just didn't do any of it. So despite being well made, well acted, and involving all sorts of talent, it just didn't leave a great impression, and it was almost a chore to sit through, and it really shouldn't have been. All in all its not the worst movie ever made, but its also not one i'll be watching over and over to absorb its brilliance. 4/10

    Oliver Stone directs this John Ridley screenplay entitled U Turn,which is adapted from Ridley's novel Stray Dogs.It features Sean Penn,Nick Nolte and Jennifer Lopez together with Joaquin Phoenix,Powers Boothe,Billy Bob Thornton,Claire Danes and Jon Voight.This film is a Southwestern noir tale about Bobby Cooper, a hotshot who is stuck in the tight confines of Superior, Arizona, when his car breaks down. His subsequent adventure is a meatball comedy which is loud, obnoxious, and violent, and stuffed with diffused light, a hot cast, and a no-fat Ennio Morricone score. A drifter eludes Las Vegas collection agents and arrives in a small town where he decides to linger after his car has a breakdown. Here he gets involved with the locals, including an unhappily married couple - a businessman and his seductive, femme-fatale wife. A trailer trash teen also approaches him in an effort to get away from her abusive boyfriend. Tensions in the town escalate, eventually leading to murder. The first 40 minutes or so are "fun" to a point. Penn is the perfect near-creep to root for, and as he wanders back into town after meeting Grace, the eclectic characters pile up. But soon it gets monotonous, tiring, and just plain ugly. And when incest and bloody fights begin, the fun is gone. If Penn weren't so solid an actor and able to be empathetic in the most morose situations, the movie would be not watchable at stretches. Lopez makes another good impression, but this is not a performance that stands out.While,Nolte is raspy and ill-looking. Before U Turn is over, you are already wondering if Oliver Stone will do something else, something more important, soon.Overall,it is a long and strange trip of a movie that is fun but aimless.

    Not as much as you'd think. It had a chance to work, but ultimately fizzled. I finally got around to watching U TURN, a full 15 years after it came out and sunk at the box office. You never even see it playing on cable, so I had to rent a copy. I just recently watched Stone's latest, SAVAGES, which I did like, but the American public apparently didn't. Anyway,I thought catch up on missed Oliver Stone movies, and this was first up. This movie had a nice look, the acting decent, and the story was OK (for the first hour anyway), but then the drag out, double-crosses (and "triple crosses") just seemed to go on forever. It should have been better, but I just can't figure out why it wasn't. I really wanted it to end soon after Nolte took the direct ax shot, but we still had another unseen plot line to develop with Boothe. Cameos by Julie Hagerty, Laurie Metcalf, and a blink & you'll miss her Liv Tyler were helpful, J. Phoenix always brings it, and the Russian guys were amusing. However, only Penn's scenes with Billy Bob really seemed to hit with some punch. I've always liked Thornton, even when he's sleep-walking through his blockbuster paycheck roles. Anyway, I say take a pass on U TURN, as it's too long and the payoff just ain't worth the wait.

    "U Turn" is often over the top, surreal and comical and Oliver Stone's style of direction plays along with these qualities perfectly. In everything he does, he favours excess over subtlety and utilises a variety of quick and often disconcerting visual techniques to create the hallucinogenic backdrop against which this twisted drama is played out. A collection of highly eccentric characters and some extraordinary performances from a star-studded cast also adds greatly to the enjoyment of watching this interesting treatment of a standard film noir plot (which bears a strong resemblance to "Red Rock West"). Bobby Cooper (Sean Penn)is a drifter who's driving to Las Vegas to pay off some gambling debts when his car's radiator hose blows and he has to make a detour to the town of Superior, Arizona to get a replacement fitted. Whilst his car is being repaired, Bobby goes into the town centre and almost straightaway, meets Grace McKenna (Jennifer Lopez). She's an attractive woman who needs assistance to carry some newly purchased drapes back to her home and Bobby is pleased to help. They start to get friendly and just as Bobby has his arms around her, Grace's husband Jake (Nick Nolte), arrives and punches Bobby to the ground. A little while later, after Bobby's left Grace's house, Jake offers him a significant amount of money to kill his wife because he's tired of her games. Bobby doesn't show any interest in the offer at that time but does later, after he loses all his money in strange circumstances after unintentionally getting caught up in a convenience store robbery. Before Bobby can go ahead with the planned murder, Grace persuades him to kill Jake so that they can steal her husband's money and go away together. They go ahead with their plan but a series of complications follow and eventually lead to a very tense and unpredictable end to the story. Bobby Cooper is a typical noir protagonist who suffers a misfortune that leads to a whole series of other problems, which all inevitably become more serious and dangerous than the last. This ex-tennis player with a gambling problem had already had two fingers cut off by the gangsters to whom he owed money before he arrived in Superior and the bad luck he suffered when his car broke down was exploited by the unscrupulous mechanic at the local garage who kept raising the cost of the job and threatening Bobby in various ways. Bobby's attraction to Grace got him caught up in a web of lust, murder and treachery and random misfortunes led to him losing his money and becoming trapped in this desert town with no means of escape. His awful predicament is then made even worse by his certain knowledge that the gangsters who want their money back know where he is and are coming to get him. Sean Penn is wonderfully intense and conveys his character's sheer desperation with immense power and conviction. There are also, however, very memorable performances by the rest of the cast who all look as if they're having a lot of fun in their roles as some of the most weird and devious people imaginable. Billy Bob Thornton stands out as the malevolent mechanic with a disgusting appearance and Nick Nolte is suitably gruff and repulsive as a man with an appalling past and no morals. Jon Voight makes a big impression as an allegedly blind Vietnam veteran who's a beggar with a penchant for making philosophical pronouncements and Jennifer Lopez is very good as the femme fatale. This neo-noir account of one man's nightmare contains so many elements that are recognisable from other film noirs that it ultimately becomes a glorious pastiche in which its many moments of dark humour act as a marvellous counterpoint to all the evil and violence that are prevalent throughout the whole story.

    U Turn is a very strange, weird and unusual film. I have recently finished watching it and I am really unsure on what to make of it. Urm, is it good? Not really. Is it bad? Not really. I just don't know what to say about it. The story is about Sean Penn's character, Bobby. He is driving through the desert on route to Vegas to pay off a gambling debt. A debt that has already cost him two fingers. Whilst driving, his radiator hose bursts and the closest place to get it fixed is a little town called Superior. He pulls into a typical looking garage for a deserted town such as this, and is greeted by a fat, hillbilly which is Billy Bob Thornton (who is actually pretty good). Bobby leaves the car in the mechanics hands and heads off to get a drink. Whilst walking through the town he meets Grace (Lopez) and an instant sexual attraction takes place. He ends up helping her put up drapes back at her home but when things heat up her husband (Nolte) arrives home and punches Bobby in the nose. Bobby then leaves the house but is tailed by Jake (J Lo's husband) and is offered money to kill his wife as he can't stand her. Bobby is unsure but when his bag of money is stolen in a grocery shop robbery, he realises he needs the money to pay off his debt or lose more of his fingers. However as he is about to kill her she offers him another proposition, kill her husband and steal his stash of cash he keeps under the floor boards. From here on Bobby must contemplate which route to take. He tries the easy option, to leave the town but the mechanics ridiculous charge for a radiator hose leaves Bobby's beloved Mustang in the mechanic's compound until he pays up. Bobby has no choice, but what will he do to get the money. The story does sound quite intriguing but everything just seems to fall in place far too easily. The characters don't force the plot twists, they just seem to randomly happen and Penn is left turning backwards and forward within this town. We also meet four other characters that seem to have very little to do with the plot other than to show the obscurity of this town. We have a Sheriff (Powers Boothe), a young couple (Claire Danes and Joaquin Phoenix), him always wanting a fight and her willing to run away with any man possible, and we are also given a blind tramp (Jon Voight) with plenty of wisdom to go around. All of these are just potential obstacles or aids and have very little usage. A debt collector comes into town at one point, on a mission to catch Bobby, but within thirty seconds he is arrested. No tension with him then as he is removed far too quickly. We find ourselves re-treading old ground as this film goes on. Each twenty minute segment just seems to repeat itself up until the strange climax. We are just shown how unlucky one man can be, and how strange this little town seems to be. The stars aren't bad with Penn giving a decent performance, I'm sure this wasn't a tough role for him. Lopez is typically her, not great and Nolte is just gruff. The star is perhaps Thornton in his unrecognizable role, it is definitely against type cast and I was fairly impressed with him. The direction isn't bad but the setting is very typical and something we've seen all too often. I was impressed with the editing and felt that there was a trippy feel to the entire film. Several camera movements and points of view shoots were stitched together well and gave a great feel to the movie. That still doesn't make it a good movie though. I was never really engaged with this film. Not once was I hooked and desperate to know what's going to happen next, in fact I didn't really care. The ending was poor and left you with a poor impression of this film. The theme seems to be about being lost and alone and the theme works as the whole way through that was exactly how I felt. 2 / 5 Tolli More reviews at: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com Follow @Tolli04

    The drifter Bobby just wants to get to Las Vegas and pay off his gambling debt. On the road in the Southwest, however, his car breaks down. He gets to the nearby small town of Superior, AZ, and he tries desperately to get back out. He runs into every kind of trouble conceivable there. Half the people he meets cause problems for him. The married couple of femme fatale Grace(an extremely hot Lopez at her most seductive, who does OK when asked to do anything more than be sultry and desirable, which she, of course, nails, pun intended) and Jake(Nolte, undeniably the creepiest presence in this, and he has serious competition for that award) both want him to kill their spouse. Darrell(Thornton in what may be his least appealing role... no, really; he's dumb, cheap, nasty and the oil on his face really gets to you) is the only chance nearby for getting the ride fixed back up, and he isn't exactly... well, all there. Blind Man Jon Voight is eccentric. And teenage Jenny(Danes, convincing as a proper little Lolita-wanna-be) falls in love with every new male face she sees with the same eagerness as her ill-tempered boyfriend Toby(Phoenix) is to beat up everyone she as much as talks to. The characters are memorable, quirky and distinct(even though there are so many of them, they all get a good amount of screen time, and we don't forget any of them). The majority of the acting is spot-on, and this makes solid use of the considerable talent featured. This is shot rather well. The editing will get on some people's nerves(it's very clearly a Stone film, and it's one of his greatest ones, as far as entertainment value goes), and it does arguably try a little hard, if it does succeed in building an atmosphere of unbearable heat, constant new obstacles, mistrust, violence and dirt(literal and figurative). Every time you think the central issue has been resolved, something new pops up to delay it. This manages to not frustrate the viewer, at least not to the point where we are unhappy with the movie... instead, we sympathize with the people(in spite of none of them being likable, without them being obnoxious to the point where you turn this off... they're interesting jerks, and that makes up for it) and their situation. The music by Ennio Morricone is excellent, and really fits the mood and tone. There is a lot of disturbing content and strong language, a little blood, nudity and sexuality in this. The DVD comes with a trailer(for this). I recommend this to any fan of those responsible for making it, and/or of filthy crime-drama-thrillers set in the middle of nowhere. 7/10

    Oliver Stone's film is full of quirky characters and does a U-turn from being a complicated little thriller into the realm of black comedy. Stone turned up the irony knob just a little too high in "U Turn"; no one wins and everyone meets an end that has its own ironic twist. Sean Penn plays Bobby Cooper, an unlikely tennis coach who is driving across Nevada with a bag of money. He needs to repay a debt to criminals who have cut off two of his fingers to expedite the repayment. He takes a U-turn off the main road when his prized, 1964 and a half Mustang Convertible bursts a radiator hose. He ends up in Superior, a dilapidated town 200 miles from Phoenix. Bobby leaves his car to be fixed at a repair shop on the edge of town run by the disgustingly dirty and dentally challenged Darrell played by Billy Bob Thornton. He meets Grace McKenna, Jennifer Lopez's character, who invites him home to help her hang curtains. When Grace's husband Jake, played by Nick Nolte, finds them together, he punches Bobby. Not your typical hero, Bobby falls to the floor whining. He can't take a trick. Robbed, beaten up, conned and used, he has little control over his life. Even his mother hangs up the phone when he rings her for help. Although Jake initially dismisses Bobby as a wimpy, pipsqueak, he offers him money to kill Grace, noting of Bobby's character, "You're a man without scruples," also telling him not to be offended because, "A man who's got no ethics is a free man." At first, Bobby refuses the offer, but after his fortunes plunge even further, he has second thoughts and agrees to kill Grace, leading to more double and triple crosses than it would be thought possible to cram into one movie. As Bobby becomes more involved with Grace, he discovers that she is also Jake's daughter  a U-turn into Roman Polanski territory. However, the surprise twist in Polanski's Chinatown is just more plot overkill in "U Turn". Eventually Bobby and Grace plan to get rid of Jake and take his money. Grace McKenna is very much sought after by men in this movie; an interest that proves fatal to all of them. However, Bobby Cooper is not quite besotted enough to want to share Jake's money with her, and they try everything to outmanoeuvre each other at every turn. The most ironic twist of all is reserved for Bobby when he is virtually the last man standing. No tricky camera angle is avoided in "U Turn", and like so much else in the film, this is overdone to the point that you almost expect every scene to be reflected in someone's sunglasses or viewed between the cameraman's legs. Despite its pretentiousness, the spectacular cast and the outrageous plot keep you going until the end  even if that ending is a bit of a letdown.

    U TURN has a great premise: a drifter shows up in an out-of-the-way town, only to fall foul of the town's weirdo inhabitants and finding himself caught up in intricate plots between various characters. It's directed by Oliver Stone, a man with a history of making challenging cinema, and it has an ensemble cast of familiar actors. What's to go wrong? The story, as it turns out. U TURN falls down because the storyline is bloated and convoluted in equal measure. It meanders from place to place as the minutes and the hours gradually roll by, and you never get closer to any kind of truth or outcome. Come the umpteenth twist at the climax, you no longer care. The central crux of the film is a love triangle but it takes an age for this to go anywhere - THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE this isn't! Instead it's dragged out long beyond any intrigue or entertainment value it might have had. Much of the film involves quirky run-ins with various off-beat characters, but that doesn't make a film. And this time, Stone's direction feels pretentious and off-putting, like he's trying too hard and going overboard with the stylistics. Cast-wise, the main actors don't fair too well. Sean Penn is as unsympathetic as ever; I don't think I've ever seen him play a genuinely warm character. It doesn't bode well. Jennifer Lopez is youthful and refreshingly free of Hollywood-style cosmetic surgery, but her acting is limited. Nick Nolte just feels like he's trying too hard. The supporting stars are better: Billy Bob Thornton as the unrecognisable garage mechanic (shades of A SIMPLE PLAN's Jacob here), Jon Voight as a hobo, Powers Boothe as the sheriff, Joaquin Phoenix as a thug. In a better film, these characters would light up the screen; here, they seem mired in a bit of a mess and a missed opportunity. With a tightened screenplay and a great deal more focus, U TURN might have turned out halfway decent.

    Wow. What a weird movie. And from Oliver Stone no less. But what a cast! Penn, Nolte, Lopez, Boothe, Voight, Thorton, Phoenix, Danes...etc. I expected a little more intensity from Penn. he seemed to weak and easily manipulated. But his character seem to demanded him to be that way. Nolte as the dirty old man who is and has been basically "raping" his step-daughter Lopez, was OK. He seemed very thin back in 1997. maybe the role demanded it. Lopez as the "femme fatale" per say did OK also. Her scenes of making love with Penn and Nolte just did not seemed convincing at all. But still, she held her own with the these two "heavyweights" of the cinema. Boothe was once again doing yet another part as a sheriff. But I felt he was wasted as usual. he really didn't have much to do but just get killed. Phoenix as T.N.T was a treat. he seemed to remind me of a young Ray Liotta. Intense and psychotic at the same time. All for the "love" of a woman. He was one of the memorable characters of the this unusual film. Danes was wasted as his "girl" who really wants to leave this hick town and leave with Penn. Thus inciting Phoenix's jealousy big-time. Thorton for me stole the picture along with Phoenix. Thorton's 'Darrell' embodied the true redneck nightmare one can encounter in these small one-horse towns. He's scary and funny at the same time. A real complete treat of casting here for Billy Bob. Voight, I did not recognize at 1st! that's how much i was paying attention. But it's because I was focusing on the other characters in the film. Voight's blind guy was somewhat memorable once you know it's him under that makeup. Julie Hargerty's waitress was OK but her scenes were way to short to appreciate them, plus she was somewhat exemplified a little exaggerating as a typical redneck town waitress. Laurie Metcalf fared a little better as the Bus Station Clerk giving Penn a hard time for not having the exact amount to buy a ticket for the bus. But again her role was brief. good but brief. Abraham Benrubi as a biker/thief was also way too brief and was also wasted. he could have been an interesting character, but was blown away way to quickly. And by a little old lady no less! I would have had him cast as the Russian enforcer who shows up at the town looking for Penn. But alas I'm not the writer of the film. Shame. But the two stars that I have no idea why they were in the movie at all because their roles were so inconsequential, that any bit-extra actor could have done their brief cameos!! I'm talking about the great Bo Hopkins and the lovely Liv Tyler. Hopkins cameo just didn't make sense to me. He's in the diner when Penn encounters Phoenix and Danes for the 1st time, but he is just a simple customer in the background!? What the hell? I believe he didn't even have any lines!? I think Stone could have put him to better use as the sheriff of the town. And had Boothe as the mafia guy that Penn owed money to. But the worst cameo was Tyler's blink or you'll miss her as the customer behind Penn at the bus station wanting to buy a ticket and Metcalf's clerk is so distraught over Penn's emotional outburst, that she closes for the day leaving Tyler like "what the hell?" Exactly. what the hell Stone? What was the point of even having her in the bit scene? I guess we will never know. just like the point of this exaggerating pulp nonsense.

    Oliver stone is a bit of an acquired taste. He makes unique movies with visual flair only he can pull off. Some might say he favors style over substance, or that he is just a lunatic with money. The problem with this film however lies within the story. With a great ensemble cast, and stylish direction this movie could have been very enjoyable. Alas it failed to keep me interested with clich&eacute; after clich&eacute;, and honestly a story that was more interesting in words then moving pictures. In fact even though the cast was great all the characters were about as bland and predictable as possible. There's a wealthy old fart married to a hot young woman who hates him, there's a tuff and gritty sheriff, a dirty sneaky mechanic, and even a weak bully with tnt shaved into his hair and a big mouth. The story unfolds much like the characters, predictably. Guy owes money to some criminals, loses the money, gets offered some more money to kill some guys wife, the end. I figured with stone at the helm he could make this all worth while, and like I said it has everything I expected, except for something called a surprise. It was all so straight forward that even all the flashy camera work and wacky acting couldn't save it. If the movie did what it should have, kept me guessing, made me laugh, shock me, anything... it could have been great. It really just didn't do any of it. So despite being well made, well acted, and involving all sorts of talent, it just didn't leave a great impression, and it was almost a chore to sit through, and it really shouldn't have been. All in all its not the worst movie ever made, but its also not one i'll be watching over and over to absorb its brilliance. 4/10

    Oliver Stone directs this John Ridley screenplay entitled U Turn,which is adapted from Ridley's novel Stray Dogs.It features Sean Penn,Nick Nolte and Jennifer Lopez together with Joaquin Phoenix,Powers Boothe,Billy Bob Thornton,Claire Danes and Jon Voight.This film is a Southwestern noir tale about Bobby Cooper, a hotshot who is stuck in the tight confines of Superior, Arizona, when his car breaks down. His subsequent adventure is a meatball comedy which is loud, obnoxious, and violent, and stuffed with diffused light, a hot cast, and a no-fat Ennio Morricone score. A drifter eludes Las Vegas collection agents and arrives in a small town where he decides to linger after his car has a breakdown. Here he gets involved with the locals, including an unhappily married couple - a businessman and his seductive, femme-fatale wife. A trailer trash teen also approaches him in an effort to get away from her abusive boyfriend. Tensions in the town escalate, eventually leading to murder. The first 40 minutes or so are "fun" to a point. Penn is the perfect near-creep to root for, and as he wanders back into town after meeting Grace, the eclectic characters pile up. But soon it gets monotonous, tiring, and just plain ugly. And when incest and bloody fights begin, the fun is gone. If Penn weren't so solid an actor and able to be empathetic in the most morose situations, the movie would be not watchable at stretches. Lopez makes another good impression, but this is not a performance that stands out.While,Nolte is raspy and ill-looking. Before U Turn is over, you are already wondering if Oliver Stone will do something else, something more important, soon.Overall,it is a long and strange trip of a movie that is fun but aimless.

    Not as much as you'd think. It had a chance to work, but ultimately fizzled. I finally got around to watching U TURN, a full 15 years after it came out and sunk at the box office. You never even see it playing on cable, so I had to rent a copy. I just recently watched Stone's latest, SAVAGES, which I did like, but the American public apparently didn't. Anyway,I thought catch up on missed Oliver Stone movies, and this was first up. This movie had a nice look, the acting decent, and the story was OK (for the first hour anyway), but then the drag out, double-crosses (and "triple crosses") just seemed to go on forever. It should have been better, but I just can't figure out why it wasn't. I really wanted it to end soon after Nolte took the direct ax shot, but we still had another unseen plot line to develop with Boothe. Cameos by Julie Hagerty, Laurie Metcalf, and a blink & you'll miss her Liv Tyler were helpful, J. Phoenix always brings it, and the Russian guys were amusing. However, only Penn's scenes with Billy Bob really seemed to hit with some punch. I've always liked Thornton, even when he's sleep-walking through his blockbuster paycheck roles. Anyway, I say take a pass on U TURN, as it's too long and the payoff just ain't worth the wait.

    "U Turn" is often over the top, surreal and comical and Oliver Stone's style of direction plays along with these qualities perfectly. In everything he does, he favours excess over subtlety and utilises a variety of quick and often disconcerting visual techniques to create the hallucinogenic backdrop against which this twisted drama is played out. A collection of highly eccentric characters and some extraordinary performances from a star-studded cast also adds greatly to the enjoyment of watching this interesting treatment of a standard film noir plot (which bears a strong resemblance to "Red Rock West"). Bobby Cooper (Sean Penn)is a drifter who's driving to Las Vegas to pay off some gambling debts when his car's radiator hose blows and he has to make a detour to the town of Superior, Arizona to get a replacement fitted. Whilst his car is being repaired, Bobby goes into the town centre and almost straightaway, meets Grace McKenna (Jennifer Lopez). She's an attractive woman who needs assistance to carry some newly purchased drapes back to her home and Bobby is pleased to help. They start to get friendly and just as Bobby has his arms around her, Grace's husband Jake (Nick Nolte), arrives and punches Bobby to the ground. A little while later, after Bobby's left Grace's house, Jake offers him a significant amount of money to kill his wife because he's tired of her games. Bobby doesn't show any interest in the offer at that time but does later, after he loses all his money in strange circumstances after unintentionally getting caught up in a convenience store robbery. Before Bobby can go ahead with the planned murder, Grace persuades him to kill Jake so that they can steal her husband's money and go away together. They go ahead with their plan but a series of complications follow and eventually lead to a very tense and unpredictable end to the story. Bobby Cooper is a typical noir protagonist who suffers a misfortune that leads to a whole series of other problems, which all inevitably become more serious and dangerous than the last. This ex-tennis player with a gambling problem had already had two fingers cut off by the gangsters to whom he owed money before he arrived in Superior and the bad luck he suffered when his car broke down was exploited by the unscrupulous mechanic at the local garage who kept raising the cost of the job and threatening Bobby in various ways. Bobby's attraction to Grace got him caught up in a web of lust, murder and treachery and random misfortunes led to him losing his money and becoming trapped in this desert town with no means of escape. His awful predicament is then made even worse by his certain knowledge that the gangsters who want their money back know where he is and are coming to get him. Sean Penn is wonderfully intense and conveys his character's sheer desperation with immense power and conviction. There are also, however, very memorable performances by the rest of the cast who all look as if they're having a lot of fun in their roles as some of the most weird and devious people imaginable. Billy Bob Thornton stands out as the malevolent mechanic with a disgusting appearance and Nick Nolte is suitably gruff and repulsive as a man with an appalling past and no morals. Jon Voight makes a big impression as an allegedly blind Vietnam veteran who's a beggar with a penchant for making philosophical pronouncements and Jennifer Lopez is very good as the femme fatale. This neo-noir account of one man's nightmare contains so many elements that are recognisable from other film noirs that it ultimately becomes a glorious pastiche in which its many moments of dark humour act as a marvellous counterpoint to all the evil and violence that are prevalent throughout the whole story.

    What a wild ride this is with a sleazy, quirky assortment of characters. Billy Bob Thornton is a hoot as the gas station attendant. Jennifer Lopez is as hot as ever. But everybody is watching out for everybody in this "noire" classic. There are twists and turns galore and we never quite know what is around the corner. Expect the unexpected. It's got a great assortment of stars, who all play their different roles to perfection in this desert saga of intrigue, bloodlust and murder. Yes the bloodlust can get carried away at times, but it's still a great watch. It's also got humour and a great wrap-up at the end!

    U Turn is a very strange, weird and unusual film. I have recently finished watching it and I am really unsure on what to make of it. Urm, is it good? Not really. Is it bad? Not really. I just don't know what to say about it. The story is about Sean Penn's character, Bobby. He is driving through the desert on route to Vegas to pay off a gambling debt. A debt that has already cost him two fingers. Whilst driving, his radiator hose bursts and the closest place to get it fixed is a little town called Superior. He pulls into a typical looking garage for a deserted town such as this, and is greeted by a fat, hillbilly which is Billy Bob Thornton (who is actually pretty good). Bobby leaves the car in the mechanics hands and heads off to get a drink. Whilst walking through the town he meets Grace (Lopez) and an instant sexual attraction takes place. He ends up helping her put up drapes back at her home but when things heat up her husband (Nolte) arrives home and punches Bobby in the nose. Bobby then leaves the house but is tailed by Jake (J Lo's husband) and is offered money to kill his wife as he can't stand her. Bobby is unsure but when his bag of money is stolen in a grocery shop robbery, he realises he needs the money to pay off his debt or lose more of his fingers. However as he is about to kill her she offers him another proposition, kill her husband and steal his stash of cash he keeps under the floor boards. From here on Bobby must contemplate which route to take. He tries the easy option, to leave the town but the mechanics ridiculous charge for a radiator hose leaves Bobby's beloved Mustang in the mechanic's compound until he pays up. Bobby has no choice, but what will he do to get the money. The story does sound quite intriguing but everything just seems to fall in place far too easily. The characters don't force the plot twists, they just seem to randomly happen and Penn is left turning backwards and forward within this town. We also meet four other characters that seem to have very little to do with the plot other than to show the obscurity of this town. We have a Sheriff (Powers Boothe), a young couple (Claire Danes and Joaquin Phoenix), him always wanting a fight and her willing to run away with any man possible, and we are also given a blind tramp (Jon Voight) with plenty of wisdom to go around. All of these are just potential obstacles or aids and have very little usage. A debt collector comes into town at one point, on a mission to catch Bobby, but within thirty seconds he is arrested. No tension with him then as he is removed far too quickly. We find ourselves re-treading old ground as this film goes on. Each twenty minute segment just seems to repeat itself up until the strange climax. We are just shown how unlucky one man can be, and how strange this little town seems to be. The stars aren't bad with Penn giving a decent performance, I'm sure this wasn't a tough role for him. Lopez is typically her, not great and Nolte is just gruff. The star is perhaps Thornton in his unrecognizable role, it is definitely against type cast and I was fairly impressed with him. The direction isn't bad but the setting is very typical and something we've seen all too often. I was impressed with the editing and felt that there was a trippy feel to the entire film. Several camera movements and points of view shoots were stitched together well and gave a great feel to the movie. That still doesn't make it a good movie though. I was never really engaged with this film. Not once was I hooked and desperate to know what's going to happen next, in fact I didn't really care. The ending was poor and left you with a poor impression of this film. The theme seems to be about being lost and alone and the theme works as the whole way through that was exactly how I felt. 2 / 5 Tolli More reviews at: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com Follow @Tolli04

    The drifter Bobby just wants to get to Las Vegas and pay off his gambling debt. On the road in the Southwest, however, his car breaks down. He gets to the nearby small town of Superior, AZ, and he tries desperately to get back out. He runs into every kind of trouble conceivable there. Half the people he meets cause problems for him. The married couple of femme fatale Grace(an extremely hot Lopez at her most seductive, who does OK when asked to do anything more than be sultry and desirable, which she, of course, nails, pun intended) and Jake(Nolte, undeniably the creepiest presence in this, and he has serious competition for that award) both want him to kill their spouse. Darrell(Thornton in what may be his least appealing role... no, really; he's dumb, cheap, nasty and the oil on his face really gets to you) is the only chance nearby for getting the ride fixed back up, and he isn't exactly... well, all there. Blind Man Jon Voight is eccentric. And teenage Jenny(Danes, convincing as a proper little Lolita-wanna-be) falls in love with every new male face she sees with the same eagerness as her ill-tempered boyfriend Toby(Phoenix) is to beat up everyone she as much as talks to. The characters are memorable, quirky and distinct(even though there are so many of them, they all get a good amount of screen time, and we don't forget any of them). The majority of the acting is spot-on, and this makes solid use of the considerable talent featured. This is shot rather well. The editing will get on some people's nerves(it's very clearly a Stone film, and it's one of his greatest ones, as far as entertainment value goes), and it does arguably try a little hard, if it does succeed in building an atmosphere of unbearable heat, constant new obstacles, mistrust, violence and dirt(literal and figurative). Every time you think the central issue has been resolved, something new pops up to delay it. This manages to not frustrate the viewer, at least not to the point where we are unhappy with the movie... instead, we sympathize with the people(in spite of none of them being likable, without them being obnoxious to the point where you turn this off... they're interesting jerks, and that makes up for it) and their situation. The music by Ennio Morricone is excellent, and really fits the mood and tone. There is a lot of disturbing content and strong language, a little blood, nudity and sexuality in this. The DVD comes with a trailer(for this). I recommend this to any fan of those responsible for making it, and/or of filthy crime-drama-thrillers set in the middle of nowhere. 7/10

    Oliver Stone's film is full of quirky characters and does a U-turn from being a complicated little thriller into the realm of black comedy. Stone turned up the irony knob just a little too high in "U Turn"; no one wins and everyone meets an end that has its own ironic twist. Sean Penn plays Bobby Cooper, an unlikely tennis coach who is driving across Nevada with a bag of money. He needs to repay a debt to criminals who have cut off two of his fingers to expedite the repayment. He takes a U-turn off the main road when his prized, 1964 and a half Mustang Convertible bursts a radiator hose. He ends up in Superior, a dilapidated town 200 miles from Phoenix. Bobby leaves his car to be fixed at a repair shop on the edge of town run by the disgustingly dirty and dentally challenged Darrell played by Billy Bob Thornton. He meets Grace McKenna, Jennifer Lopez's character, who invites him home to help her hang curtains. When Grace's husband Jake, played by Nick Nolte, finds them together, he punches Bobby. Not your typical hero, Bobby falls to the floor whining. He can't take a trick. Robbed, beaten up, conned and used, he has little control over his life. Even his mother hangs up the phone when he rings her for help. Although Jake initially dismisses Bobby as a wimpy, pipsqueak, he offers him money to kill Grace, noting of Bobby's character, "You're a man without scruples," also telling him not to be offended because, "A man who's got no ethics is a free man." At first, Bobby refuses the offer, but after his fortunes plunge even further, he has second thoughts and agrees to kill Grace, leading to more double and triple crosses than it would be thought possible to cram into one movie. As Bobby becomes more involved with Grace, he discovers that she is also Jake's daughter  a U-turn into Roman Polanski territory. However, the surprise twist in Polanski's Chinatown is just more plot overkill in "U Turn". Eventually Bobby and Grace plan to get rid of Jake and take his money. Grace McKenna is very much sought after by men in this movie; an interest that proves fatal to all of them. However, Bobby Cooper is not quite besotted enough to want to share Jake's money with her, and they try everything to outmanoeuvre each other at every turn. The most ironic twist of all is reserved for Bobby when he is virtually the last man standing. No tricky camera angle is avoided in "U Turn", and like so much else in the film, this is overdone to the point that you almost expect every scene to be reflected in someone's sunglasses or viewed between the cameraman's legs. Despite its pretentiousness, the spectacular cast and the outrageous plot keep you going until the end  even if that ending is a bit of a letdown.

    U TURN has a great premise: a drifter shows up in an out-of-the-way town, only to fall foul of the town's weirdo inhabitants and finding himself caught up in intricate plots between various characters. It's directed by Oliver Stone, a man with a history of making challenging cinema, and it has an ensemble cast of familiar actors. What's to go wrong? The story, as it turns out. U TURN falls down because the storyline is bloated and convoluted in equal measure. It meanders from place to place as the minutes and the hours gradually roll by, and you never get closer to any kind of truth or outcome. Come the umpteenth twist at the climax, you no longer care. The central crux of the film is a love triangle but it takes an age for this to go anywhere - THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE this isn't! Instead it's dragged out long beyond any intrigue or entertainment value it might have had. Much of the film involves quirky run-ins with various off-beat characters, but that doesn't make a film. And this time, Stone's direction feels pretentious and off-putting, like he's trying too hard and going overboard with the stylistics. Cast-wise, the main actors don't fair too well. Sean Penn is as unsympathetic as ever; I don't think I've ever seen him play a genuinely warm character. It doesn't bode well. Jennifer Lopez is youthful and refreshingly free of Hollywood-style cosmetic surgery, but her acting is limited. Nick Nolte just feels like he's trying too hard. The supporting stars are better: Billy Bob Thornton as the unrecognisable garage mechanic (shades of A SIMPLE PLAN's Jacob here), Jon Voight as a hobo, Powers Boothe as the sheriff, Joaquin Phoenix as a thug. In a better film, these characters would light up the screen; here, they seem mired in a bit of a mess and a missed opportunity. With a tightened screenplay and a great deal more focus, U TURN might have turned out halfway decent.

    Wow. What a weird movie. And from Oliver Stone no less. But what a cast! Penn, Nolte, Lopez, Boothe, Voight, Thorton, Phoenix, Danes...etc. I expected a little more intensity from Penn. he seemed to weak and easily manipulated. But his character seem to demanded him to be that way. Nolte as the dirty old man who is and has been basically "raping" his step-daughter Lopez, was OK. He seemed very thin back in 1997. maybe the role demanded it. Lopez as the "femme fatale" per say did OK also. Her scenes of making love with Penn and Nolte just did not seemed convincing at all. But still, she held her own with the these two "heavyweights" of the cinema. Boothe was once again doing yet another part as a sheriff. But I felt he was wasted as usual. he really didn't have much to do but just get killed. Phoenix as T.N.T was a treat. he seemed to remind me of a young Ray Liotta. Intense and psychotic at the same time. All for the "love" of a woman. He was one of the memorable characters of the this unusual film. Danes was wasted as his "girl" who really wants to leave this hick town and leave with Penn. Thus inciting Phoenix's jealousy big-time. Thorton for me stole the picture along with Phoenix. Thorton's 'Darrell' embodied the true redneck nightmare one can encounter in these small one-horse towns. He's scary and funny at the same time. A real complete treat of casting here for Billy Bob. Voight, I did not recognize at 1st! that's how much i was paying attention. But it's because I was focusing on the other characters in the film. Voight's blind guy was somewhat memorable once you know it's him under that makeup. Julie Hargerty's waitress was OK but her scenes were way to short to appreciate them, plus she was somewhat exemplified a little exaggerating as a typical redneck town waitress. Laurie Metcalf fared a little better as the Bus Station Clerk giving Penn a hard time for not having the exact amount to buy a ticket for the bus. But again her role was brief. good but brief. Abraham Benrubi as a biker/thief was also way too brief and was also wasted. he could have been an interesting character, but was blown away way to quickly. And by a little old lady no less! I would have had him cast as the Russian enforcer who shows up at the town looking for Penn. But alas I'm not the writer of the film. Shame. But the two stars that I have no idea why they were in the movie at all because their roles were so inconsequential, that any bit-extra actor could have done their brief cameos!! I'm talking about the great Bo Hopkins and the lovely Liv Tyler. Hopkins cameo just didn't make sense to me. He's in the diner when Penn encounters Phoenix and Danes for the 1st time, but he is just a simple customer in the background!? What the hell? I believe he didn't even have any lines!? I think Stone could have put him to better use as the sheriff of the town. And had Boothe as the mafia guy that Penn owed money to. But the worst cameo was Tyler's blink or you'll miss her as the customer behind Penn at the bus station wanting to buy a ticket and Metcalf's clerk is so distraught over Penn's emotional outburst, that she closes for the day leaving Tyler like "what the hell?" Exactly. what the hell Stone? What was the point of even having her in the bit scene? I guess we will never know. just like the point of this exaggerating pulp nonsense.

    Oliver stone is a bit of an acquired taste. He makes unique movies with visual flair only he can pull off. Some might say he favors style over substance, or that he is just a lunatic with money. The problem with this film however lies within the story. With a great ensemble cast, and stylish direction this movie could have been very enjoyable. Alas it failed to keep me interested with clich&eacute; after clich&eacute;, and honestly a story that was more interesting in words then moving pictures. In fact even though the cast was great all the characters were about as bland and predictable as possible. There's a wealthy old fart married to a hot young woman who hates him, there's a tuff and gritty sheriff, a dirty sneaky mechanic, and even a weak bully with tnt shaved into his hair and a big mouth. The story unfolds much like the characters, predictably. Guy owes money to some criminals, loses the money, gets offered some more money to kill some guys wife, the end. I figured with stone at the helm he could make this all worth while, and like I said it has everything I expected, except for something called a surprise. It was all so straight forward that even all the flashy camera work and wacky acting couldn't save it. If the movie did what it should have, kept me guessing, made me laugh, shock me, anything... it could have been great. It really just didn't do any of it. So despite being well made, well acted, and involving all sorts of talent, it just didn't leave a great impression, and it was almost a chore to sit through, and it really shouldn't have been. All in all its not the worst movie ever made, but its also not one i'll be watching over and over to absorb its brilliance. 4/10

    Oliver Stone directs this John Ridley screenplay entitled U Turn,which is adapted from Ridley's novel Stray Dogs.It features Sean Penn,Nick Nolte and Jennifer Lopez together with Joaquin Phoenix,Powers Boothe,Billy Bob Thornton,Claire Danes and Jon Voight.This film is a Southwestern noir tale about Bobby Cooper, a hotshot who is stuck in the tight confines of Superior, Arizona, when his car breaks down. His subsequent adventure is a meatball comedy which is loud, obnoxious, and violent, and stuffed with diffused light, a hot cast, and a no-fat Ennio Morricone score. A drifter eludes Las Vegas collection agents and arrives in a small town where he decides to linger after his car has a breakdown. Here he gets involved with the locals, including an unhappily married couple - a businessman and his seductive, femme-fatale wife. A trailer trash teen also approaches him in an effort to get away from her abusive boyfriend. Tensions in the town escalate, eventually leading to murder. The first 40 minutes or so are "fun" to a point. Penn is the perfect near-creep to root for, and as he wanders back into town after meeting Grace, the eclectic characters pile up. But soon it gets monotonous, tiring, and just plain ugly. And when incest and bloody fights begin, the fun is gone. If Penn weren't so solid an actor and able to be empathetic in the most morose situations, the movie would be not watchable at stretches. Lopez makes another good impression, but this is not a performance that stands out.While,Nolte is raspy and ill-looking. Before U Turn is over, you are already wondering if Oliver Stone will do something else, something more important, soon.Overall,it is a long and strange trip of a movie that is fun but aimless.

    Not as much as you'd think. It had a chance to work, but ultimately fizzled. I finally got around to watching U TURN, a full 15 years after it came out and sunk at the box office. You never even see it playing on cable, so I had to rent a copy. I just recently watched Stone's latest, SAVAGES, which I did like, but the American public apparently didn't. Anyway,I thought catch up on missed Oliver Stone movies, and this was first up. This movie had a nice look, the acting decent, and the story was OK (for the first hour anyway), but then the drag out, double-crosses (and "triple crosses") just seemed to go on forever. It should have been better, but I just can't figure out why it wasn't. I really wanted it to end soon after Nolte took the direct ax shot, but we still had another unseen plot line to develop with Boothe. Cameos by Julie Hagerty, Laurie Metcalf, and a blink & you'll miss her Liv Tyler were helpful, J. Phoenix always brings it, and the Russian guys were amusing. However, only Penn's scenes with Billy Bob really seemed to hit with some punch. I've always liked Thornton, even when he's sleep-walking through his blockbuster paycheck roles. Anyway, I say take a pass on U TURN, as it's too long and the payoff just ain't worth the wait.

    "U Turn" is often over the top, surreal and comical and Oliver Stone's style of direction plays along with these qualities perfectly. In everything he does, he favours excess over subtlety and utilises a variety of quick and often disconcerting visual techniques to create the hallucinogenic backdrop against which this twisted drama is played out. A collection of highly eccentric characters and some extraordinary performances from a star-studded cast also adds greatly to the enjoyment of watching this interesting treatment of a standard film noir plot (which bears a strong resemblance to "Red Rock West"). Bobby Cooper (Sean Penn)is a drifter who's driving to Las Vegas to pay off some gambling debts when his car's radiator hose blows and he has to make a detour to the town of Superior, Arizona to get a replacement fitted. Whilst his car is being repaired, Bobby goes into the town centre and almost straightaway, meets Grace McKenna (Jennifer Lopez). She's an attractive woman who needs assistance to carry some newly purchased drapes back to her home and Bobby is pleased to help. They start to get friendly and just as Bobby has his arms around her, Grace's husband Jake (Nick Nolte), arrives and punches Bobby to the ground. A little while later, after Bobby's left Grace's house, Jake offers him a significant amount of money to kill his wife because he's tired of her games. Bobby doesn't show any interest in the offer at that time but does later, after he loses all his money in strange circumstances after unintentionally getting caught up in a convenience store robbery. Before Bobby can go ahead with the planned murder, Grace persuades him to kill Jake so that they can steal her husband's money and go away together. They go ahead with their plan but a series of complications follow and eventually lead to a very tense and unpredictable end to the story. Bobby Cooper is a typical noir protagonist who suffers a misfortune that leads to a whole series of other problems, which all inevitably become more serious and dangerous than the last. This ex-tennis player with a gambling problem had already had two fingers cut off by the gangsters to whom he owed money before he arrived in Superior and the bad luck he suffered when his car broke down was exploited by the unscrupulous mechanic at the local garage who kept raising the cost of the job and threatening Bobby in various ways. Bobby's attraction to Grace got him caught up in a web of lust, murder and treachery and random misfortunes led to him losing his money and becoming trapped in this desert town with no means of escape. His awful predicament is then made even worse by his certain knowledge that the gangsters who want their money back know where he is and are coming to get him. Sean Penn is wonderfully intense and conveys his character's sheer desperation with immense power and conviction. There are also, however, very memorable performances by the rest of the cast who all look as if they're having a lot of fun in their roles as some of the most weird and devious people imaginable. Billy Bob Thornton stands out as the malevolent mechanic with a disgusting appearance and Nick Nolte is suitably gruff and repulsive as a man with an appalling past and no morals. Jon Voight makes a big impression as an allegedly blind Vietnam veteran who's a beggar with a penchant for making philosophical pronouncements and Jennifer Lopez is very good as the femme fatale. This neo-noir account of one man's nightmare contains so many elements that are recognisable from other film noirs that it ultimately becomes a glorious pastiche in which its many moments of dark humour act as a marvellous counterpoint to all the evil and violence that are prevalent throughout the whole story.

    What a wild ride this is with a sleazy, quirky assortment of characters. Billy Bob Thornton is a hoot as the gas station attendant. Jennifer Lopez is as hot as ever. But everybody is watching out for everybody in this "noire" classic. There are twists and turns galore and we never quite know what is around the corner. Expect the unexpected. It's got a great assortment of stars, who all play their different roles to perfection in this desert saga of intrigue, bloodlust and murder. Yes the bloodlust can get carried away at times, but it's still a great watch. It's also got humour and a great wrap-up at the end!

    U Turn is a very strange, weird and unusual film. I have recently finished watching it and I am really unsure on what to make of it. Urm, is it good? Not really. Is it bad? Not really. I just don't know what to say about it. The story is about Sean Penn's character, Bobby. He is driving through the desert on route to Vegas to pay off a gambling debt. A debt that has already cost him two fingers. Whilst driving, his radiator hose bursts and the closest place to get it fixed is a little town called Superior. He pulls into a typical looking garage for a deserted town such as this, and is greeted by a fat, hillbilly which is Billy Bob Thornton (who is actually pretty good). Bobby leaves the car in the mechanics hands and heads off to get a drink. Whilst walking through the town he meets Grace (Lopez) and an instant sexual attraction takes place. He ends up helping her put up drapes back at her home but when things heat up her husband (Nolte) arrives home and punches Bobby in the nose. Bobby then leaves the house but is tailed by Jake (J Lo's husband) and is offered money to kill his wife as he can't stand her. Bobby is unsure but when his bag of money is stolen in a grocery shop robbery, he realises he needs the money to pay off his debt or lose more of his fingers. However as he is about to kill her she offers him another proposition, kill her husband and steal his stash of cash he keeps under the floor boards. From here on Bobby must contemplate which route to take. He tries the easy option, to leave the town but the mechanics ridiculous charge for a radiator hose leaves Bobby's beloved Mustang in the mechanic's compound until he pays up. Bobby has no choice, but what will he do to get the money. The story does sound quite intriguing but everything just seems to fall in place far too easily. The characters don't force the plot twists, they just seem to randomly happen and Penn is left turning backwards and forward within this town. We also meet four other characters that seem to have very little to do with the plot other than to show the obscurity of this town. We have a Sheriff (Powers Boothe), a young couple (Claire Danes and Joaquin Phoenix), him always wanting a fight and her willing to run away with any man possible, and we are also given a blind tramp (Jon Voight) with plenty of wisdom to go around. All of these are just potential obstacles or aids and have very little usage. A debt collector comes into town at one point, on a mission to catch Bobby, but within thirty seconds he is arrested. No tension with him then as he is removed far too quickly. We find ourselves re-treading old ground as this film goes on. Each twenty minute segment just seems to repeat itself up until the strange climax. We are just shown how unlucky one man can be, and how strange this little town seems to be. The stars aren't bad with Penn giving a decent performance, I'm sure this wasn't a tough role for him. Lopez is typically her, not great and Nolte is just gruff. The star is perhaps Thornton in his unrecognizable role, it is definitely against type cast and I was fairly impressed with him. The direction isn't bad but the setting is very typical and something we've seen all too often. I was impressed with the editing and felt that there was a trippy feel to the entire film. Several camera movements and points of view shoots were stitched together well and gave a great feel to the movie. That still doesn't make it a good movie though. I was never really engaged with this film. Not once was I hooked and desperate to know what's going to happen next, in fact I didn't really care. The ending was poor and left you with a poor impression of this film. The theme seems to be about being lost and alone and the theme works as the whole way through that was exactly how I felt. 2 / 5 Tolli More reviews at: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com Follow @Tolli04

    The drifter Bobby just wants to get to Las Vegas and pay off his gambling debt. On the road in the Southwest, however, his car breaks down. He gets to the nearby small town of Superior, AZ, and he tries desperately to get back out. He runs into every kind of trouble conceivable there. Half the people he meets cause problems for him. The married couple of femme fatale Grace(an extremely hot Lopez at her most seductive, who does OK when asked to do anything more than be sultry and desirable, which she, of course, nails, pun intended) and Jake(Nolte, undeniably the creepiest presence in this, and he has serious competition for that award) both want him to kill their spouse. Darrell(Thornton in what may be his least appealing role... no, really; he's dumb, cheap, nasty and the oil on his face really gets to you) is the only chance nearby for getting the ride fixed back up, and he isn't exactly... well, all there. Blind Man Jon Voight is eccentric. And teenage Jenny(Danes, convincing as a proper little Lolita-wanna-be) falls in love with every new male face she sees with the same eagerness as her ill-tempered boyfriend Toby(Phoenix) is to beat up everyone she as much as talks to. The characters are memorable, quirky and distinct(even though there are so many of them, they all get a good amount of screen time, and we don't forget any of them). The majority of the acting is spot-on, and this makes solid use of the considerable talent featured. This is shot rather well. The editing will get on some people's nerves(it's very clearly a Stone film, and it's one of his greatest ones, as far as entertainment value goes), and it does arguably try a little hard, if it does succeed in building an atmosphere of unbearable heat, constant new obstacles, mistrust, violence and dirt(literal and figurative). Every time you think the central issue has been resolved, something new pops up to delay it. This manages to not frustrate the viewer, at least not to the point where we are unhappy with the movie... instead, we sympathize with the people(in spite of none of them being likable, without them being obnoxious to the point where you turn this off... they're interesting jerks, and that makes up for it) and their situation. The music by Ennio Morricone is excellent, and really fits the mood and tone. There is a lot of disturbing content and strong language, a little blood, nudity and sexuality in this. The DVD comes with a trailer(for this). I recommend this to any fan of those responsible for making it, and/or of filthy crime-drama-thrillers set in the middle of nowhere. 7/10

    Oliver Stone's film is full of quirky characters and does a U-turn from being a complicated little thriller into the realm of black comedy. Stone turned up the irony knob just a little too high in "U Turn"; no one wins and everyone meets an end that has its own ironic twist. Sean Penn plays Bobby Cooper, an unlikely tennis coach who is driving across Nevada with a bag of money. He needs to repay a debt to criminals who have cut off two of his fingers to expedite the repayment. He takes a U-turn off the main road when his prized, 1964 and a half Mustang Convertible bursts a radiator hose. He ends up in Superior, a dilapidated town 200 miles from Phoenix. Bobby leaves his car to be fixed at a repair shop on the edge of town run by the disgustingly dirty and dentally challenged Darrell played by Billy Bob Thornton. He meets Grace McKenna, Jennifer Lopez's character, who invites him home to help her hang curtains. When Grace's husband Jake, played by Nick Nolte, finds them together, he punches Bobby. Not your typical hero, Bobby falls to the floor whining. He can't take a trick. Robbed, beaten up, conned and used, he has little control over his life. Even his mother hangs up the phone when he rings her for help. Although Jake initially dismisses Bobby as a wimpy, pipsqueak, he offers him money to kill Grace, noting of Bobby's character, "You're a man without scruples," also telling him not to be offended because, "A man who's got no ethics is a free man." At first, Bobby refuses the offer, but after his fortunes plunge even further, he has second thoughts and agrees to kill Grace, leading to more double and triple crosses than it would be thought possible to cram into one movie. As Bobby becomes more involved with Grace, he discovers that she is also Jake's daughter  a U-turn into Roman Polanski territory. However, the surprise twist in Polanski's Chinatown is just more plot overkill in "U Turn". Eventually Bobby and Grace plan to get rid of Jake and take his money. Grace McKenna is very much sought after by men in this movie; an interest that proves fatal to all of them. However, Bobby Cooper is not quite besotted enough to want to share Jake's money with her, and they try everything to outmanoeuvre each other at every turn. The most ironic twist of all is reserved for Bobby when he is virtually the last man standing. No tricky camera angle is avoided in "U Turn", and like so much else in the film, this is overdone to the point that you almost expect every scene to be reflected in someone's sunglasses or viewed between the cameraman's legs. Despite its pretentiousness, the spectacular cast and the outrageous plot keep you going until the end  even if that ending is a bit of a letdown.

In a better film, these characters would light up the screen; here, they seem mired in a bit of a mess and a missed opportunity. With a tightened screenplay and a great deal more focus, U TURN might have turned out halfway decent.

    Wow. What a weird movie. And from Oliver Stone no less. But what a cast! Penn, Nolte, Lopez, Boothe, Voight, Thorton, Phoenix, Danes...etc. I expected a little more intensity from Penn. he seemed to weak and easily manipulated. But his character seem to demanded him to be that way. Nolte as the dirty old man who is and has been basically "raping" his step-daughter Lopez, was OK. He seemed very thin back in 1997. maybe the role demanded it. Lopez as the "femme fatale" per say did OK also. Her scenes of making love with Penn and Nolte just did not seemed convincing at all. But still, she held her own with the these two "heavyweights" of the cinema. Boothe was once again doing yet another part as a sheriff. But I felt he was wasted as usual. he really didn't have much to do but just get killed. Phoenix as T.N.T was a treat. he seemed to remind me of a young Ray Liotta. Intense and psychotic at the same time. All for the "love" of a woman. He was one of the memorable characters of the this unusual film. Danes was wasted as his "girl" who really wants to leave this hick town and leave with Penn. Thus inciting Phoenix's jealousy big-time. Thorton for me stole the picture along with Phoenix. Thorton's 'Darrell' embodied the true redneck nightmare one can encounter in these small one-horse towns. He's scary and funny at the same time. A real complete treat of casting here for Billy Bob. Voight, I did not recognize at 1st! that's how much i was paying attention. But it's because I was focusing on the other characters in the film. Voight's blind guy was somewhat memorable once you know it's him under that makeup. Julie Hargerty's waitress was OK but her scenes were way to short to appreciate them, plus she was somewhat exemplified a little exaggerating as a typical redneck town waitress. Laurie Metcalf fared a little better as the Bus Station Clerk giving Penn a hard time for not having the exact amount to buy a ticket for the bus. But again her role was brief. good but brief. Abraham Benrubi as a biker/thief was also way too brief and was also wasted. he could have been an interesting character, but was blown away way to quickly. And by a little old lady no less! I would have had him cast as the Russian enforcer who shows up at the town looking for Penn. But alas I'm not the writer of the film. Shame. But the two stars that I have no idea why they were in the movie at all because their roles were so inconsequential, that any bit-extra actor could have done their brief cameos!! I'm talking about the great Bo Hopkins and the lovely Liv Tyler. Hopkins cameo just didn't make sense to me. He's in the diner when Penn encounters Phoenix and Danes for the 1st time, but he is just a simple customer in the background!? What the hell? I believe he didn't even have any lines!? I think Stone could have put him to better use as the sheriff of the town. And had Boothe as the mafia guy that Penn owed money to. But the worst cameo was Tyler's blink or you'll miss her as the customer behind Penn at the bus station wanting to buy a ticket and Metcalf's clerk is so distraught over Penn's emotional outburst, that she closes for the day leaving Tyler like "what the hell?" Exactly. what the hell Stone? What was the point of even having her in the bit scene? I guess we will never know. just like the point of this exaggerating pulp nonsense.

    Oliver stone is a bit of an acquired taste. He makes unique movies with visual flair only he can pull off. Some might say he favors style over substance, or that he is just a lunatic with money. The problem with this film however lies within the story. With a great ensemble cast, and stylish direction this movie could have been very enjoyable. Alas it failed to keep me interested with clich&eacute; after clich&eacute;, and honestly a story that was more interesting in words then moving pictures. In fact even though the cast was great all the characters were about as bland and predictable as possible. There's a wealthy old fart married to a hot young woman who hates him, there's a tuff and gritty sheriff, a dirty sneaky mechanic, and even a weak bully with tnt shaved into his hair and a big mouth. The story unfolds much like the characters, predictably. Guy owes money to some criminals, loses the money, gets offered some more money to kill some guys wife, the end. I figured with stone at the helm he could make this all worth while, and like I said it has everything I expected, except for something called a surprise. It was all so straight forward that even all the flashy camera work and wacky acting couldn't save it. If the movie did what it should have, kept me guessing, made me laugh, shock me, anything... it could have been great. It really just didn't do any of it. So despite being well made, well acted, and involving all sorts of talent, it just didn't leave a great impression, and it was almost a chore to sit through, and it really shouldn't have been. All in all its not the worst movie ever made, but its also not one i'll be watching over and over to absorb its brilliance. 4/10

    Oliver Stone directs this John Ridley screenplay entitled U Turn,which is adapted from Ridley's novel Stray Dogs.It features Sean Penn,Nick Nolte and Jennifer Lopez together with Joaquin Phoenix,Powers Boothe,Billy Bob Thornton,Claire Danes and Jon Voight.This film is a Southwestern noir tale about Bobby Cooper, a hotshot who is stuck in the tight confines of Superior, Arizona, when his car breaks down. His subsequent adventure is a meatball comedy which is loud, obnoxious, and violent, and stuffed with diffused light, a hot cast, and a no-fat Ennio Morricone score. A drifter eludes Las Vegas collection agents and arrives in a small town where he decides to linger after his car has a breakdown. Here he gets involved with the locals, including an unhappily married couple - a businessman and his seductive, femme-fatale wife. A trailer trash teen also approaches him in an effort to get away from her abusive boyfriend. Tensions in the town escalate, eventually leading to murder. The first 40 minutes or so are "fun" to a point. Penn is the perfect near-creep to root for, and as he wanders back into town after meeting Grace, the eclectic characters pile up. But soon it gets monotonous, tiring, and just plain ugly. And when incest and bloody fights begin, the fun is gone. If Penn weren't so solid an actor and able to be empathetic in the most morose situations, the movie would be not watchable at stretches. Lopez makes another good impression, but this is not a performance that stands out.While,Nolte is raspy and ill-looking. Before U Turn is over, you are already wondering if Oliver Stone will do something else, something more important, soon.Overall,it is a long and strange trip of a movie that is fun but aimless.

    Not as much as you'd think. It had a chance to work, but ultimately fizzled. I finally got around to watching U TURN, a full 15 years after it came out and sunk at the box office. You never even see it playing on cable, so I had to rent a copy. I just recently watched Stone's latest, SAVAGES, which I did like, but the American public apparently didn't. Anyway,I thought catch up on missed Oliver Stone movies, and this was first up. This movie had a nice look, the acting decent, and the story was OK (for the first hour anyway), but then the drag out, double-crosses (and "triple crosses") just seemed to go on forever. It should have been better, but I just can't figure out why it wasn't. I really wanted it to end soon after Nolte took the direct ax shot, but we still had another unseen plot line to develop with Boothe. Cameos by Julie Hagerty, Laurie Metcalf, and a blink & you'll miss her Liv Tyler were helpful, J. Phoenix always brings it, and the Russian guys were amusing. However, only Penn's scenes with Billy Bob really seemed to hit with some punch. I've always liked Thornton, even when he's sleep-walking through his blockbuster paycheck roles. Anyway, I say take a pass on U TURN, as it's too long and the payoff just ain't worth the wait.

    "U Turn" is often over the top, surreal and comical and Oliver Stone's style of direction plays along with these qualities perfectly. In everything he does, he favours excess over subtlety and utilises a variety of quick and often disconcerting visual techniques to create the hallucinogenic backdrop against which this twisted drama is played out. A collection of highly eccentric characters and some extraordinary performances from a star-studded cast also adds greatly to the enjoyment of watching this interesting treatment of a standard film noir plot (which bears a strong resemblance to "Red Rock West"). Bobby Cooper (Sean Penn)is a drifter who's driving to Las Vegas to pay off some gambling debts when his car's radiator hose blows and he has to make a detour to the town of Superior, Arizona to get a replacement fitted. Whilst his car is being repaired, Bobby goes into the town centre and almost straightaway, meets Grace McKenna (Jennifer Lopez). She's an attractive woman who needs assistance to carry some newly purchased drapes back to her home and Bobby is pleased to help. They start to get friendly and just as Bobby has his arms around her, Grace's husband Jake (Nick Nolte), arrives and punches Bobby to the ground. A little while later, after Bobby's left Grace's house, Jake offers him a significant amount of money to kill his wife because he's tired of her games. Bobby doesn't show any interest in the offer at that time but does later, after he loses all his money in strange circumstances after unintentionally getting caught up in a convenience store robbery. Before Bobby can go ahead with the planned murder, Grace persuades him to kill Jake so that they can steal her husband's money and go away together. They go ahead with their plan but a series of complications follow and eventually lead to a very tense and unpredictable end to the story. Bobby Cooper is a typical noir protagonist who suffers a misfortune that leads to a whole series of other problems, which all inevitably become more serious and dangerous than the last. This ex-tennis player with a gambling problem had already had two fingers cut off by the gangsters to whom he owed money before he arrived in Superior and the bad luck he suffered when his car broke down was exploited by the unscrupulous mechanic at the local garage who kept raising the cost of the job and threatening Bobby in various ways. Bobby's attraction to Grace got him caught up in a web of lust, murder and treachery and random misfortunes led to him losing his money and becoming trapped in this desert town with no means of escape. His awful predicament is then made even worse by his certain knowledge that the gangsters who want their money back know where he is and are coming to get him. Sean Penn is wonderfully intense and conveys his character's sheer desperation with immense power and conviction. There are also, however, very memorable performances by the rest of the cast who all look as if they're having a lot of fun in their roles as some of the most weird and devious people imaginable. Billy Bob Thornton stands out as the malevolent mechanic with a disgusting appearance and Nick Nolte is suitably gruff and repulsive as a man with an appalling past and no morals. Jon Voight makes a big impression as an allegedly blind Vietnam veteran who's a beggar with a penchant for making philosophical pronouncements and Jennifer Lopez is very good as the femme fatale. This neo-noir account of one man's nightmare contains so many elements that are recognisable from other film noirs that it ultimately becomes a glorious pastiche in which its many moments of dark humour act as a marvellous counterpoint to all the evil and violence that are prevalent throughout the whole story.

    What a wild ride this is with a sleazy, quirky assortment of characters. Billy Bob Thornton is a hoot as the gas station attendant. Jennifer Lopez is as hot as ever. But everybody is watching out for everybody in this "noire" classic. There are twists and turns galore and we never quite know what is around the corner. Expect the unexpected. It's got a great assortment of stars, who all play their different roles to perfection in this desert saga of intrigue, bloodlust and murder. Yes the bloodlust can get carried away at times, but it's still a great watch. It's also got humour and a great wrap-up at the end!

    U Turn is a very strange, weird and unusual film. I have recently finished watching it and I am really unsure on what to make of it. Urm, is it good? Not really. Is it bad? Not really. I just don't know what to say about it. The story is about Sean Penn's character, Bobby. He is driving through the desert on route to Vegas to pay off a gambling debt. A debt that has already cost him two fingers. Whilst driving, his radiator hose bursts and the closest place to get it fixed is a little town called Superior. He pulls into a typical looking garage for a deserted town such as this, and is greeted by a fat, hillbilly which is Billy Bob Thornton (who is actually pretty good). Bobby leaves the car in the mechanics hands and heads off to get a drink. Whilst walking through the town he meets Grace (Lopez) and an instant sexual attraction takes place. He ends up helping her put up drapes back at her home but when things heat up her husband (Nolte) arrives home and punches Bobby in the nose. Bobby then leaves the house but is tailed by Jake (J Lo's husband) and is offered money to kill his wife as he can't stand her. Bobby is unsure but when his bag of money is stolen in a grocery shop robbery, he realises he needs the money to pay off his debt or lose more of his fingers. However as he is about to kill her she offers him another proposition, kill her husband and steal his stash of cash he keeps under the floor boards. From here on Bobby must contemplate which route to take. He tries the easy option, to leave the town but the mechanics ridiculous charge for a radiator hose leaves Bobby's beloved Mustang in the mechanic's compound until he pays up. Bobby has no choice, but what will he do to get the money. The story does sound quite intriguing but everything just seems to fall in place far too easily. The characters don't force the plot twists, they just seem to randomly happen and Penn is left turning backwards and forward within this town. We also meet four other characters that seem to have very little to do with the plot other than to show the obscurity of this town. We have a Sheriff (Powers Boothe), a young couple (Claire Danes and Joaquin Phoenix), him always wanting a fight and her willing to run away with any man possible, and we are also given a blind tramp (Jon Voight) with plenty of wisdom to go around. All of these are just potential obstacles or aids and have very little usage. A debt collector comes into town at one point, on a mission to catch Bobby, but within thirty seconds he is arrested. No tension with him then as he is removed far too quickly. We find ourselves re-treading old ground as this film goes on. Each twenty minute segment just seems to repeat itself up until the strange climax. We are just shown how unlucky one man can be, and how strange this little town seems to be. The stars aren't bad with Penn giving a decent performance, I'm sure this wasn't a tough role for him. Lopez is typically her, not great and Nolte is just gruff. The star is perhaps Thornton in his unrecognizable role, it is definitely against type cast and I was fairly impressed with him. The direction isn't bad but the setting is very typical and something we've seen all too often. I was impressed with the editing and felt that there was a trippy feel to the entire film. Several camera movements and points of view shoots were stitched together well and gave a great feel to the movie. That still doesn't make it a good movie though. I was never really engaged with this film. Not once was I hooked and desperate to know what's going to happen next, in fact I didn't really care. The ending was poor and left you with a poor impression of this film. The theme seems to be about being lost and alone and the theme works as the whole way through that was exactly how I felt. 2 / 5 Tolli More reviews at: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com Follow @Tolli04

    The drifter Bobby just wants to get to Las Vegas and pay off his gambling debt. On the road in the Southwest, however, his car breaks down. He gets to the nearby small town of Superior, AZ, and he tries desperately to get back out. He runs into every kind of trouble conceivable there. Half the people he meets cause problems for him. The married couple of femme fatale Grace(an extremely hot Lopez at her most seductive, who does OK when asked to do anything more than be sultry and desirable, which she, of course, nails, pun intended) and Jake(Nolte, undeniably the creepiest presence in this, and he has serious competition for that award) both want him to kill their spouse. Darrell(Thornton in what may be his least appealing role... no, really; he's dumb, cheap, nasty and the oil on his face really gets to you) is the only chance nearby for getting the ride fixed back up, and he isn't exactly... well, all there. Blind Man Jon Voight is eccentric. And teenage Jenny(Danes, convincing as a proper little Lolita-wanna-be) falls in love with every new male face she sees with the same eagerness as her ill-tempered boyfriend Toby(Phoenix) is to beat up everyone she as much as talks to. The characters are memorable, quirky and distinct(even though there are so many of them, they all get a good amount of screen time, and we don't forget any of them). The majority of the acting is spot-on, and this makes solid use of the considerable talent featured. This is shot rather well. The editing will get on some people's nerves(it's very clearly a Stone film, and it's one of his greatest ones, as far as entertainment value goes), and it does arguably try a little hard, if it does succeed in building an atmosphere of unbearable heat, constant new obstacles, mistrust, violence and dirt(literal and figurative). Every time you think the central issue has been resolved, something new pops up to delay it. This manages to not frustrate the viewer, at least not to the point where we are unhappy with the movie... instead, we sympathize with the people(in spite of none of them being likable, without them being obnoxious to the point where you turn this off... they're interesting jerks, and that makes up for it) and their situation. The music by Ennio Morricone is excellent, and really fits the mood and tone. There is a lot of disturbing content and strong language, a little blood, nudity and sexuality in this. The DVD comes with a trailer(for this). I recommend this to any fan of those responsible for making it, and/or of filthy crime-drama-thrillers set in the middle of nowhere. 7/10

    Oliver Stone's film is full of quirky characters and does a U-turn from being a complicated little thriller into the realm of black comedy. Stone turned up the irony knob just a little too high in "U Turn"; no one wins and everyone meets an end that has its own ironic twist. Sean Penn plays Bobby Cooper, an unlikely tennis coach who is driving across Nevada with a bag of money. He needs to repay a debt to criminals who have cut off two of his fingers to expedite the repayment. He takes a U-turn off the main road when his prized, 1964 and a half Mustang Convertible bursts a radiator hose. He ends up in Superior, a dilapidated town 200 miles from Phoenix. Bobby leaves his car to be fixed at a repair shop on the edge of town run by the disgustingly dirty and dentally challenged Darrell played by Billy Bob Thornton. He meets Grace McKenna, Jennifer Lopez's character, who invites him home to help her hang curtains. When Grace's husband Jake, played by Nick Nolte, finds them together, he punches Bobby. Not your typical hero, Bobby falls to the floor whining. He can't take a trick. Robbed, beaten up, conned and used, he has little control over his life. Even his mother hangs up the phone when he rings her for help. Although Jake initially dismisses Bobby as a wimpy, pipsqueak, he offers him money to kill Grace, noting of Bobby's character, "You're a man without scruples," also telling him not to be offended because, "A man who's got no ethics is a free man." At first, Bobby refuses the offer, but after his fortunes plunge even further, he has second thoughts and agrees to kill Grace, leading to more double and triple crosses than it would be thought possible to cram into one movie. As Bobby becomes more involved with Grace, he discovers that she is also Jake's daughter  a U-turn into Roman Polanski territory. However, the surprise twist in Polanski's Chinatown is just more plot overkill in "U Turn". Eventually Bobby and Grace plan to get rid of Jake and take his money. Grace McKenna is very much sought after by men in this movie; an interest that proves fatal to all of them. However, Bobby Cooper is not quite besotted enough to want to share Jake's money with her, and they try everything to outmanoeuvre each other at every turn. The most ironic twist of all is reserved for Bobby when he is virtually the last man standing. No tricky camera angle is avoided in "U Turn", and like so much else in the film, this is overdone to the point that you almost expect every scene to be reflected in someone's sunglasses or viewed between the cameraman's legs. Despite its pretentiousness, the spectacular cast and the outrageous plot keep you going until the end  even if that ending is a bit of a letdown.

    U TURN has a great premise: a drifter shows up in an out-of-the-way town, only to fall foul of the town's weirdo inhabitants and finding himself caught up in intricate plots between various characters. It's directed by Oliver Stone, a man with a history of making challenging cinema, and it has an ensemble cast of familiar actors. What's to go wrong? The story, as it turns out. U TURN falls down because the storyline is bloated and convoluted in equal measure. It meanders from place to place as the minutes and the hours gradually roll by, and you never get closer to any kind of truth or outcome. Come the umpteenth twist at the climax, you no longer care. The central crux of the film is a love triangle but it takes an age for this to go anywhere - THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE this isn't! Instead it's dragged out long beyond any intrigue or entertainment value it might have had. Much of the film involves quirky run-ins with various off-beat characters, but that doesn't make a film. And this time, Stone's direction feels pretentious and off-putting, like he's trying too hard and going overboard with the stylistics. Cast-wise, the main actors don't fair too well. Sean Penn is as unsympathetic as ever; I don't think I've ever seen him play a genuinely warm character. It doesn't bode well. Jennifer Lopez is youthful and refreshingly free of Hollywood-style cosmetic surgery, but her acting is limited. Nick Nolte just feels like he's trying too hard. The supporting stars are better: Billy Bob Thornton as the unrecognisable garage mechanic (shades of A SIMPLE PLAN's Jacob here), Jon Voight as a hobo, Powers Boothe as the sheriff, Joaquin Phoenix as a thug. In a better film, these characters would light up the screen; here, they seem mired in a bit of a mess and a missed opportunity. With a tightened screenplay and a great deal more focus, U TURN might have turned out halfway decent.

    Wow. What a weird movie. And from Oliver Stone no less. But what a cast! Penn, Nolte, Lopez, Boothe, Voight, Thorton, Phoenix, Danes...etc. I expected a little more intensity from Penn. he seemed to weak and easily manipulated. But his character seem to demanded him to be that way. Nolte as the dirty old man who is and has been basically "raping" his step-daughter Lopez, was OK. He seemed very thin back in 1997. maybe the role demanded it. Lopez as the "femme fatale" per say did OK also. Her scenes of making love with Penn and Nolte just did not seemed convincing at all. But still, she held her own with the these two "heavyweights" of the cinema. Boothe was once again doing yet another part as a sheriff. But I felt he was wasted as usual. he really didn't have much to do but just get killed. Phoenix as T.N.T was a treat. he seemed to remind me of a young Ray Liotta. Intense and psychotic at the same time. All for the "love" of a woman. He was one of the memorable characters of the this unusual film. Danes was wasted as his "girl" who really wants to leave this hick town and leave with Penn. Thus inciting Phoenix's jealousy big-time. Thorton for me stole the picture along with Phoenix. Thorton's 'Darrell' embodied the true redneck nightmare one can encounter in these small one-horse towns. He's scary and funny at the same time. A real complete treat of casting here for Billy Bob. Voight, I did not recognize at 1st! that's how much i was paying attention. But it's because I was focusing on the other characters in the film. Voight's blind guy was somewhat memorable once you know it's him under that makeup. Julie Hargerty's waitress was OK but her scenes were way to short to appreciate them, plus she was somewhat exemplified a little exaggerating as a typical redneck town waitress. Laurie Metcalf fared a little better as the Bus Station Clerk giving Penn a hard time for not having the exact amount to buy a ticket for the bus. But again her role was brief. good but brief. Abraham Benrubi as a biker/thief was also way too brief and was also wasted. he could have been an interesting character, but was blown away way to quickly. And by a little old lady no less! I would have had him cast as the Russian enforcer who shows up at the town looking for Penn. But alas I'm not the writer of the film. Shame. But the two stars that I have no idea why they were in the movie at all because their roles were so inconsequential, that any bit-extra actor could have done their brief cameos!! I'm talking about the great Bo Hopkins and the lovely Liv Tyler. Hopkins cameo just didn't make sense to me. He's in the diner when Penn encounters Phoenix and Danes for the 1st time, but he is just a simple customer in the background!? What the hell? I believe he didn't even have any lines!? I think Stone could have put him to better use as the sheriff of the town. And had Boothe as the mafia guy that Penn owed money to. But the worst cameo was Tyler's blink or you'll miss her as the customer behind Penn at the bus station wanting to buy a ticket and Metcalf's clerk is so distraught over Penn's emotional outburst, that she closes for the day leaving Tyler like "what the hell?" Exactly. what the hell Stone? What was the point of even having her in the bit scene? I guess we will never know. just like the point of this exaggerating pulp nonsense.

    Oliver Stone directs this John Ridley screenplay entitled U Turn,which is adapted from Ridley's novel Stray Dogs.It features Sean Penn,Nick Nolte and Jennifer Lopez together with Joaquin Phoenix,Powers Boothe,Billy Bob Thornton,Claire Danes and Jon Voight.This film is a Southwestern noir tale about Bobby Cooper, a hotshot who is stuck in the tight confines of Superior, Arizona, when his car breaks down. His subsequent adventure is a meatball comedy which is loud, obnoxious, and violent, and stuffed with diffused light, a hot cast, and a no-fat Ennio Morricone score. A drifter eludes Las Vegas collection agents and arrives in a small town where he decides to linger after his car has a breakdown. Here he gets involved with the locals, including an unhappily married couple - a businessman and his seductive, femme-fatale wife. A trailer trash teen also approaches him in an effort to get away from her abusive boyfriend. Tensions in the town escalate, eventually leading to murder. The first 40 minutes or so are "fun" to a point. Penn is the perfect near-creep to root for, and as he wanders back into town after meeting Grace, the eclectic characters pile up. But soon it gets monotonous, tiring, and just plain ugly. And when incest and bloody fights begin, the fun is gone. If Penn weren't so solid an actor and able to be empathetic in the most morose situations, the movie would be not watchable at stretches. Lopez makes another good impression, but this is not a performance that stands out.While,Nolte is raspy and ill-looking. Before U Turn is over, you are already wondering if Oliver Stone will do something else, something more important, soon.Overall,it is a long and strange trip of a movie that is fun but aimless.

    Not as much as you'd think. It had a chance to work, but ultimately fizzled. I finally got around to watching U TURN, a full 15 years after it came out and sunk at the box office. You never even see it playing on cable, so I had to rent a copy. I just recently watched Stone's latest, SAVAGES, which I did like, but the American public apparently didn't. Anyway,I thought catch up on missed Oliver Stone movies, and this was first up. This movie had a nice look, the acting decent, and the story was OK (for the first hour anyway), but then the drag out, double-crosses (and "triple crosses") just seemed to go on forever. It should have been better, but I just can't figure out why it wasn't. I really wanted it to end soon after Nolte took the direct ax shot, but we still had another unseen plot line to develop with Boothe. Cameos by Julie Hagerty, Laurie Metcalf, and a blink & you'll miss her Liv Tyler were helpful, J. Phoenix always brings it, and the Russian guys were amusing. However, only Penn's scenes with Billy Bob really seemed to hit with some punch. I've always liked Thornton, even when he's sleep-walking through his blockbuster paycheck roles. Anyway, I say take a pass on U TURN, as it's too long and the payoff just ain't worth the wait.

    "U Turn" is often over the top, surreal and comical and Oliver Stone's style of direction plays along with these qualities perfectly. In everything he does, he favours excess over subtlety and utilises a variety of quick and often disconcerting visual techniques to create the hallucinogenic backdrop against which this twisted drama is played out. A collection of highly eccentric characters and some extraordinary performances from a star-studded cast also adds greatly to the enjoyment of watching this interesting treatment of a standard film noir plot (which bears a strong resemblance to "Red Rock West"). Bobby Cooper (Sean Penn)is a drifter who's driving to Las Vegas to pay off some gambling debts when his car's radiator hose blows and he has to make a detour to the town of Superior, Arizona to get a replacement fitted. Whilst his car is being repaired, Bobby goes into the town centre and almost straightaway, meets Grace McKenna (Jennifer Lopez). She's an attractive woman who needs assistance to carry some newly purchased drapes back to her home and Bobby is pleased to help. They start to get friendly and just as Bobby has his arms around her, Grace's husband Jake (Nick Nolte), arrives and punches Bobby to the ground. A little while later, after Bobby's left Grace's house, Jake offers him a significant amount of money to kill his wife because he's tired of her games. Bobby doesn't show any interest in the offer at that time but does later, after he loses all his money in strange circumstances after unintentionally getting caught up in a convenience store robbery. Before Bobby can go ahead with the planned murder, Grace persuades him to kill Jake so that they can steal her husband's money and go away together. They go ahead with their plan but a series of complications follow and eventually lead to a very tense and unpredictable end to the story. Bobby Cooper is a typical noir protagonist who suffers a misfortune that leads to a whole series of other problems, which all inevitably become more serious and dangerous than the last. This ex-tennis player with a gambling problem had already had two fingers cut off by the gangsters to whom he owed money before he arrived in Superior and the bad luck he suffered when his car broke down was exploited by the unscrupulous mechanic at the local garage who kept raising the cost of the job and threatening Bobby in various ways. Bobby's attraction to Grace got him caught up in a web of lust, murder and treachery and random misfortunes led to him losing his money and becoming trapped in this desert town with no means of escape. His awful predicament is then made even worse by his certain knowledge that the gangsters who want their money back know where he is and are coming to get him. Sean Penn is wonderfully intense and conveys his character's sheer desperation with immense power and conviction. There are also, however, very memorable performances by the rest of the cast who all look as if they're having a lot of fun in their roles as some of the most weird and devious people imaginable. Billy Bob Thornton stands out as the malevolent mechanic with a disgusting appearance and Nick Nolte is suitably gruff and repulsive as a man with an appalling past and no morals. Jon Voight makes a big impression as an allegedly blind Vietnam veteran who's a beggar with a penchant for making philosophical pronouncements and Jennifer Lopez is very good as the femme fatale. This neo-noir account of one man's nightmare contains so many elements that are recognisable from other film noirs that it ultimately becomes a glorious pastiche in which its many moments of dark humour act as a marvellous counterpoint to all the evil and violence that are prevalent throughout the whole story.

    What a wild ride this is with a sleazy, quirky assortment of characters. Billy Bob Thornton is a hoot as the gas station attendant. Jennifer Lopez is as hot as ever. But everybody is watching out for everybody in this "noire" classic. There are twists and turns galore and we never quite know what is around the corner. Expect the unexpected. It's got a great assortment of stars, who all play their different roles to perfection in this desert saga of intrigue, bloodlust and murder. Yes the bloodlust can get carried away at times, but it's still a great watch. It's also got humour and a great wrap-up at the end!

    U Turn is a very strange, weird and unusual film. I have recently finished watching it and I am really unsure on what to make of it. Urm, is it good? Not really. Is it bad? Not really. I just don't know what to say about it. The story is about Sean Penn's character, Bobby. He is driving through the desert on route to Vegas to pay off a gambling debt. A debt that has already cost him two fingers. Whilst driving, his radiator hose bursts and the closest place to get it fixed is a little town called Superior. He pulls into a typical looking garage for a deserted town such as this, and is greeted by a fat, hillbilly which is Billy Bob Thornton (who is actually pretty good). Bobby leaves the car in the mechanics hands and heads off to get a drink. Whilst walking through the town he meets Grace (Lopez) and an instant sexual attraction takes place. He ends up helping her put up drapes back at her home but when things heat up her husband (Nolte) arrives home and punches Bobby in the nose. Bobby then leaves the house but is tailed by Jake (J Lo's husband) and is offered money to kill his wife as he can't stand her. Bobby is unsure but when his bag of money is stolen in a grocery shop robbery, he realises he needs the money to pay off his debt or lose more of his fingers. However as he is about to kill her she offers him another proposition, kill her husband and steal his stash of cash he keeps under the floor boards. From here on Bobby must contemplate which route to take. He tries the easy option, to leave the town but the mechanics ridiculous charge for a radiator hose leaves Bobby's beloved Mustang in the mechanic's compound until he pays up. Bobby has no choice, but what will he do to get the money. The story does sound quite intriguing but everything just seems to fall in place far too easily. The characters don't force the plot twists, they just seem to randomly happen and Penn is left turning backwards and forward within this town. We also meet four other characters that seem to have very little to do with the plot other than to show the obscurity of this town. We have a Sheriff (Powers Boothe), a young couple (Claire Danes and Joaquin Phoenix), him always wanting a fight and her willing to run away with any man possible, and we are also given a blind tramp (Jon Voight) with plenty of wisdom to go around. All of these are just potential obstacles or aids and have very little usage. A debt collector comes into town at one point, on a mission to catch Bobby, but within thirty seconds he is arrested. No tension with him then as he is removed far too quickly. We find ourselves re-treading old ground as this film goes on. Each twenty minute segment just seems to repeat itself up until the strange climax. We are just shown how unlucky one man can be, and how strange this little town seems to be. The stars aren't bad with Penn giving a decent performance, I'm sure this wasn't a tough role for him. Lopez is typically her, not great and Nolte is just gruff. The star is perhaps Thornton in his unrecognizable role, it is definitely against type cast and I was fairly impressed with him. The direction isn't bad but the setting is very typical and something we've seen all too often. I was impressed with the editing and felt that there was a trippy feel to the entire film. Several camera movements and points of view shoots were stitched together well and gave a great feel to the movie. That still doesn't make it a good movie though. I was never really engaged with this film. Not once was I hooked and desperate to know what's going to happen next, in fact I didn't really care. The ending was poor and left you with a poor impression of this film. The theme seems to be about being lost and alone and the theme works as the whole way through that was exactly how I felt. 2 / 5 Tolli More reviews at: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com Follow @Tolli04

    The drifter Bobby just wants to get to Las Vegas and pay off his gambling debt. On the road in the Southwest, however, his car breaks down. He gets to the nearby small town of Superior, AZ, and he tries desperately to get back out. He runs into every kind of trouble conceivable there. Half the people he meets cause problems for him. The married couple of femme fatale Grace(an extremely hot Lopez at her most seductive, who does OK when asked to do anything more than be sultry and desirable, which she, of course, nails, pun intended) and Jake(Nolte, undeniably the creepiest presence in this, and he has serious competition for that award) both want him to kill their spouse. Darrell(Thornton in what may be his least appealing role... no, really; he's dumb, cheap, nasty and the oil on his face really gets to you) is the only chance nearby for getting the ride fixed back up, and he isn't exactly... well, all there. Blind Man Jon Voight is eccentric. And teenage Jenny(Danes, convincing as a proper little Lolita-wanna-be) falls in love with every new male face she sees with the same eagerness as her ill-tempered boyfriend Toby(Phoenix) is to beat up everyone she as much as talks to. The characters are memorable, quirky and distinct(even though there are so many of them, they all get a good amount of screen time, and we don't forget any of them). The majority of the acting is spot-on, and this makes solid use of the considerable talent featured. This is shot rather well. The editing will get on some people's nerves(it's very clearly a Stone film, and it's one of his greatest ones, as far as entertainment value goes), and it does arguably try a little hard, if it does succeed in building an atmosphere of unbearable heat, constant new obstacles, mistrust, violence and dirt(literal and figurative). Every time you think the central issue has been resolved, something new pops up to delay it. This manages to not frustrate the viewer, at least not to the point where we are unhappy with the movie... instead, we sympathize with the people(in spite of none of them being likable, without them being obnoxious to the point where you turn this off... they're interesting jerks, and that makes up for it) and their situation. The music by Ennio Morricone is excellent, and really fits the mood and tone. There is a lot of disturbing content and strong language, a little blood, nudity and sexuality in this. The DVD comes with a trailer(for this). I recommend this to any fan of those responsible for making it, and/or of filthy crime-drama-thrillers set in the middle of nowhere. 7/10

    Oliver Stone's film is full of quirky characters and does a U-turn from being a complicated little thriller into the realm of black comedy. Stone turned up the irony knob just a little too high in "U Turn"; no one wins and everyone meets an end that has its own ironic twist. Sean Penn plays Bobby Cooper, an unlikely tennis coach who is driving across Nevada with a bag of money. He needs to repay a debt to criminals who have cut off two of his fingers to expedite the repayment. He takes a U-turn off the main road when his prized, 1964 and a half Mustang Convertible bursts a radiator hose. He ends up in Superior, a dilapidated town 200 miles from Phoenix. Bobby leaves his car to be fixed at a repair shop on the edge of town run by the disgustingly dirty and dentally challenged Darrell played by Billy Bob Thornton. He meets Grace McKenna, Jennifer Lopez's character, who invites him home to help her hang curtains. When Grace's husband Jake, played by Nick Nolte, finds them together, he punches Bobby. Not your typical hero, Bobby falls to the floor whining. He can't take a trick. Robbed, beaten up, conned and used, he has little control over his life. Even his mother hangs up the phone when he rings her for help. Although Jake initially dismisses Bobby as a wimpy, pipsqueak, he offers him money to kill Grace, noting of Bobby's character, "You're a man without scruples," also telling him not to be offended because, "A man who's got no ethics is a free man." At first, Bobby refuses the offer, but after his fortunes plunge even further, he has second thoughts and agrees to kill Grace, leading to more double and triple crosses than it would be thought possible to cram into one movie. As Bobby becomes more involved with Grace, he discovers that she is also Jake's daughter  a U-turn into Roman Polanski territory. However, the surprise twist in Polanski's Chinatown is just more plot overkill in "U Turn". Eventually Bobby and Grace plan to get rid of Jake and take his money. Grace McKenna is very much sought after by men in this movie; an interest that proves fatal to all of them. However, Bobby Cooper is not quite besotted enough to want to share Jake's money with her, and they try everything to outmanoeuvre each other at every turn. The most ironic twist of all is reserved for Bobby when he is virtually the last man standing. No tricky camera angle is avoided in "U Turn", and like so much else in the film, this is overdone to the point that you almost expect every scene to be reflected in someone's sunglasses or viewed between the cameraman's legs. Despite its pretentiousness, the spectacular cast and the outrageous plot keep you going until the end  even if that ending is a bit of a letdown.

    U TURN has a great premise: a drifter shows up in an out-of-the-way town, only to fall foul of the town's weirdo inhabitants and finding himself caught up in intricate plots between various characters. It's directed by Oliver Stone, a man with a history of making challenging cinema, and it has an ensemble cast of familiar actors. What's to go wrong? The story, as it turns out. U TURN falls down because the storyline is bloated and convoluted in equal measure. It meanders from place to place as the minutes and the hours gradually roll by, and you never get closer to any kind of truth or outcome. Come the umpteenth twist at the climax, you no longer care. The central crux of the film is a love triangle but it takes an age for this to go anywhere - THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE this isn't! Instead it's dragged out long beyond any intrigue or entertainment value it might have had. Much of the film involves quirky run-ins with various off-beat characters, but that doesn't make a film. And this time, Stone's direction feels pretentious and off-putting, like he's trying too hard and going overboard with the stylistics. Cast-wise, the main actors don't fair too well. Sean Penn is as unsympathetic as ever; I don't think I've ever seen him play a genuinely warm character. It doesn't bode well. Jennifer Lopez is youthful and refreshingly free of Hollywood-style cosmetic surgery, but her acting is limited. Nick Nolte just feels like he's trying too hard. The supporting stars are better: Billy Bob Thornton as the unrecognisable garage mechanic (shades of A SIMPLE PLAN's Jacob here), Jon Voight as a hobo, Powers Boothe as the sheriff, Joaquin Phoenix as a thug. In a better film, these characters would light up the screen; here, they seem mired in a bit of a mess and a missed opportunity. With a tightened screenplay and a great deal more focus, U TURN might have turned out halfway decent.

    Wow. What a weird movie. And from Oliver Stone no less. But what a cast! Penn, Nolte, Lopez, Boothe, Voight, Thorton, Phoenix, Danes...etc. I expected a little more intensity from Penn. he seemed to weak and easily manipulated. But his character seem to demanded him to be that way. Nolte as the dirty old man who is and has been basically "raping" his step-daughter Lopez, was OK. He seemed very thin back in 1997. maybe the role demanded it. Lopez as the "femme fatale" per say did OK also. Her scenes of making love with Penn and Nolte just did not seemed convincing at all. But still, she held her own with the these two "heavyweights" of the cinema. Boothe was once again doing yet another part as a sheriff. But I felt he was wasted as usual. he really didn't have much to do but just get killed. Phoenix as T.N.T was a treat. he seemed to remind me of a young Ray Liotta. Intense and psychotic at the same time. All for the "love" of a woman. He was one of the memorable characters of the this unusual film. Danes was wasted as his "girl" who really wants to leave this hick town and leave with Penn. Thus inciting Phoenix's jealousy big-time. Thorton for me stole the picture along with Phoenix. Thorton's 'Darrell' embodied the true redneck nightmare one can encounter in these small one-horse towns. He's scary and funny at the same time. A real complete treat of casting here for Billy Bob. Voight, I did not recognize at 1st! that's how much i was paying attention. But it's because I was focusing on the other characters in the film. Voight's blind guy was somewhat memorable once you know it's him under that makeup. Julie Hargerty's waitress was OK but her scenes were way to short to appreciate them, plus she was somewhat exemplified a little exaggerating as a typical redneck town waitress. Laurie Metcalf fared a little better as the Bus Station Clerk giving Penn a hard time for not having the exact amount to buy a ticket for the bus. But again her role was brief. good but brief. Abraham Benrubi as a biker/thief was also way too brief and was also wasted. he could have been an interesting character, but was blown away way to quickly. And by a little old lady no less! I would have had him cast as the Russian enforcer who shows up at the town looking for Penn. But alas I'm not the writer of the film. Shame. But the two stars that I have no idea why they were in the movie at all because their roles were so inconsequential, that any bit-extra actor could have done their brief cameos!! I'm talking about the great Bo Hopkins and the lovely Liv Tyler. Hopkins cameo just didn't make sense to me. He's in the diner when Penn encounters Phoenix and Danes for the 1st time, but he is just a simple customer in the background!? What the hell? I believe he didn't even have any lines!? I think Stone could have put him to better use as the sheriff of the town. And had Boothe as the mafia guy that Penn owed money to. But the worst cameo was Tyler's blink or you'll miss her as the customer behind Penn at the bus station wanting to buy a ticket and Metcalf's clerk is so distraught over Penn's emotional outburst, that she closes for the day leaving Tyler like "what the hell?" Exactly. what the hell Stone? What was the point of even having her in the bit scene? I guess we will never know. just like the point of this exaggerating pulp nonsense.

    Oliver stone is a bit of an acquired taste. He makes unique movies with visual flair only he can pull off. Some might say he favors style over substance, or that he is just a lunatic with money. The problem with this film however lies within the story. With a great ensemble cast, and stylish direction this movie could have been very enjoyable. Alas it failed to keep me interested with clich&eacute; after clich&eacute;, and honestly a story that was more interesting in words then moving pictures. In fact even though the cast was great all the characters were about as bland and predictable as possible. There's a wealthy old fart married to a hot young woman who hates him, there's a tuff and gritty sheriff, a dirty sneaky mechanic, and even a weak bully with tnt shaved into his hair and a big mouth. The story unfolds much like the characters, predictably. Guy owes money to some criminals, loses the money, gets offered some more money to kill some guys wife, the end. I figured with stone at the helm he could make this all worth while, and like I said it has everything I expected, except for something called a surprise. It was all so straight forward that even all the flashy camera work and wacky acting couldn't save it. If the movie did what it should have, kept me guessing, made me laugh, shock me, anything... it could have been great. It really just didn't do any of it. So despite being well made, well acted, and involving all sorts of talent, it just didn't leave a great impression, and it was almost a chore to sit through, and it really shouldn't have been. All in all its not the worst movie ever made, but its also not one i'll be watching over and over to absorb its brilliance. 4/10

    Oliver Stone directs this John Ridley screenplay entitled U Turn,which is adapted from Ridley's novel Stray Dogs.It features Sean Penn,Nick Nolte and Jennifer Lopez together with Joaquin Phoenix,Powers Boothe,Billy Bob Thornton,Claire Danes and Jon Voight.This film is a Southwestern noir tale about Bobby Cooper, a hotshot who is stuck in the tight confines of Superior, Arizona, when his car breaks down. His subsequent adventure is a meatball comedy which is loud, obnoxious, and violent, and stuffed with diffused light, a hot cast, and a no-fat Ennio Morricone score. A drifter eludes Las Vegas collection agents and arrives in a small town where he decides to linger after his car has a breakdown. Here he gets involved with the locals, including an unhappily married couple - a businessman and his seductive, femme-fatale wife. A trailer trash teen also approaches him in an effort to get away from her abusive boyfriend. Tensions in the town escalate, eventually leading to murder. The first 40 minutes or so are "fun" to a point. Penn is the perfect near-creep to root for, and as he wanders back into town after meeting Grace, the eclectic characters pile up. But soon it gets monotonous, tiring, and just plain ugly. And when incest and bloody fights begin, the fun is gone. If Penn weren't so solid an actor and able to be empathetic in the most morose situations, the movie would be not watchable at stretches. Lopez makes another good impression, but this is not a performance that stands out.While,Nolte is raspy and ill-looking. Before U Turn is over, you are already wondering if Oliver Stone will do something else, something more important, soon.Overall,it is a long and strange trip of a movie that is fun but aimless.

    "U Turn" is often over the top, surreal and comical and Oliver Stone's style of direction plays along with these qualities perfectly. In everything he does, he favours excess over subtlety and utilises a variety of quick and often disconcerting visual techniques to create the hallucinogenic backdrop against which this twisted drama is played out. A collection of highly eccentric characters and some extraordinary performances from a star-studded cast also adds greatly to the enjoyment of watching this interesting treatment of a standard film noir plot (which bears a strong resemblance to "Red Rock West"). Bobby Cooper (Sean Penn)is a drifter who's driving to Las Vegas to pay off some gambling debts when his car's radiator hose blows and he has to make a detour to the town of Superior, Arizona to get a replacement fitted. Whilst his car is being repaired, Bobby goes into the town centre and almost straightaway, meets Grace McKenna (Jennifer Lopez). She's an attractive woman who needs assistance to carry some newly purchased drapes back to her home and Bobby is pleased to help. They start to get friendly and just as Bobby has his arms around her, Grace's husband Jake (Nick Nolte), arrives and punches Bobby to the ground. A little while later, after Bobby's left Grace's house, Jake offers him a significant amount of money to kill his wife because he's tired of her games. Bobby doesn't show any interest in the offer at that time but does later, after he loses all his money in strange circumstances after unintentionally getting caught up in a convenience store robbery. Before Bobby can go ahead with the planned murder, Grace persuades him to kill Jake so that they can steal her husband's money and go away together. They go ahead with their plan but a series of complications follow and eventually lead to a very tense and unpredictable end to the story. Bobby Cooper is a typical noir protagonist who suffers a misfortune that leads to a whole series of other problems, which all inevitably become more serious and dangerous than the last. This ex-tennis player with a gambling problem had already had two fingers cut off by the gangsters to whom he owed money before he arrived in Superior and the bad luck he suffered when his car broke down was exploited by the unscrupulous mechanic at the local garage who kept raising the cost of the job and threatening Bobby in various ways. Bobby's attraction to Grace got him caught up in a web of lust, murder and treachery and random misfortunes led to him losing his money and becoming trapped in this desert town with no means of escape. His awful predicament is then made even worse by his certain knowledge that the gangsters who want their money back know where he is and are coming to get him. Sean Penn is wonderfully intense and conveys his character's sheer desperation with immense power and conviction. There are also, however, very memorable performances by the rest of the cast who all look as if they're having a lot of fun in their roles as some of the most weird and devious people imaginable. Billy Bob Thornton stands out as the malevolent mechanic with a disgusting appearance and Nick Nolte is suitably gruff and repulsive as a man with an appalling past and no morals. Jon Voight makes a big impression as an allegedly blind Vietnam veteran who's a beggar with a penchant for making philosophical pronouncements and Jennifer Lopez is very good as the femme fatale. This neo-noir account of one man's nightmare contains so many elements that are recognisable from other film noirs that it ultimately becomes a glorious pastiche in which its many moments of dark humour act as a marvellous counterpoint to all the evil and violence that are prevalent throughout the whole story.

    What a wild ride this is with a sleazy, quirky assortment of characters. Billy Bob Thornton is a hoot as the gas station attendant. Jennifer Lopez is as hot as ever. But everybody is watching out for everybody in this "noire" classic. There are twists and turns galore and we never quite know what is around the corner. Expect the unexpected. It's got a great assortment of stars, who all play their different roles to perfection in this desert saga of intrigue, bloodlust and murder. Yes the bloodlust can get carried away at times, but it's still a great watch. It's also got humour and a great wrap-up at the end!

    U Turn is a very strange, weird and unusual film. I have recently finished watching it and I am really unsure on what to make of it. Urm, is it good? Not really. Is it bad? Not really. I just don't know what to say about it. The story is about Sean Penn's character, Bobby. He is driving through the desert on route to Vegas to pay off a gambling debt. A debt that has already cost him two fingers. Whilst driving, his radiator hose bursts and the closest place to get it fixed is a little town called Superior. He pulls into a typical looking garage for a deserted town such as this, and is greeted by a fat, hillbilly which is Billy Bob Thornton (who is actually pretty good). Bobby leaves the car in the mechanics hands and heads off to get a drink. Whilst walking through the town he meets Grace (Lopez) and an instant sexual attraction takes place. He ends up helping her put up drapes back at her home but when things heat up her husband (Nolte) arrives home and punches Bobby in the nose. Bobby then leaves the house but is tailed by Jake (J Lo's husband) and is offered money to kill his wife as he can't stand her. Bobby is unsure but when his bag of money is stolen in a grocery shop robbery, he realises he needs the money to pay off his debt or lose more of his fingers. However as he is about to kill her she offers him another proposition, kill her husband and steal his stash of cash he keeps under the floor boards. From here on Bobby must contemplate which route to take. He tries the easy option, to leave the town but the mechanics ridiculous charge for a radiator hose leaves Bobby's beloved Mustang in the mechanic's compound until he pays up. Bobby has no choice, but what will he do to get the money. The story does sound quite intriguing but everything just seems to fall in place far too easily. The characters don't force the plot twists, they just seem to randomly happen and Penn is left turning backwards and forward within this town. We also meet four other characters that seem to have very little to do with the plot other than to show the obscurity of this town. We have a Sheriff (Powers Boothe), a young couple (Claire Danes and Joaquin Phoenix), him always wanting a fight and her willing to run away with any man possible, and we are also given a blind tramp (Jon Voight) with plenty of wisdom to go around. All of these are just potential obstacles or aids and have very little usage. A debt collector comes into town at one point, on a mission to catch Bobby, but within thirty seconds he is arrested. No tension with him then as he is removed far too quickly. We find ourselves re-treading old ground as this film goes on. Each twenty minute segment just seems to repeat itself up until the strange climax. We are just shown how unlucky one man can be, and how strange this little town seems to be. The stars aren't bad with Penn giving a decent performance, I'm sure this wasn't a tough role for him. Lopez is typically her, not great and Nolte is just gruff. The star is perhaps Thornton in his unrecognizable role, it is definitely against type cast and I was fairly impressed with him. The direction isn't bad but the setting is very typical and something we've seen all too often. I was impressed with the editing and felt that there was a trippy feel to the entire film. Several camera movements and points of view shoots were stitched together well and gave a great feel to the movie. That still doesn't make it a good movie though. I was never really engaged with this film. Not once was I hooked and desperate to know what's going to happen next, in fact I didn't really care. The ending was poor and left you with a poor impression of this film. The theme seems to be about being lost and alone and the theme works as the whole way through that was exactly how I felt. 2 / 5 Tolli More reviews at: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com Follow @Tolli04

    The drifter Bobby just wants to get to Las Vegas and pay off his gambling debt. On the road in the Southwest, however, his car breaks down. He gets to the nearby small town of Superior, AZ, and he tries desperately to get back out. He runs into every kind of trouble conceivable there. Half the people he meets cause problems for him. The married couple of femme fatale Grace(an extremely hot Lopez at her most seductive, who does OK when asked to do anything more than be sultry and desirable, which she, of course, nails, pun intended) and Jake(Nolte, undeniably the creepiest presence in this, and he has serious competition for that award) both want him to kill their spouse. Darrell(Thornton in what may be his least appealing role... no, really; he's dumb, cheap, nasty and the oil on his face really gets to you) is the only chance nearby for getting the ride fixed back up, and he isn't exactly... well, all there. Blind Man Jon Voight is eccentric. And teenage Jenny(Danes, convincing as a proper little Lolita-wanna-be) falls in love with every new male face she sees with the same eagerness as her ill-tempered boyfriend Toby(Phoenix) is to beat up everyone she as much as talks to. The characters are memorable, quirky and distinct(even though there are so many of them, they all get a good amount of screen time, and we don't forget any of them). The majority of the acting is spot-on, and this makes solid use of the considerable talent featured. This is shot rather well. The editing will get on some people's nerves(it's very clearly a Stone film, and it's one of his greatest ones, as far as entertainment value goes), and it does arguably try a little hard, if it does succeed in building an atmosphere of unbearable heat, constant new obstacles, mistrust, violence and dirt(literal and figurative). Every time you think the central issue has been resolved, something new pops up to delay it. This manages to not frustrate the viewer, at least not to the point where we are unhappy with the movie... instead, we sympathize with the people(in spite of none of them being likable, without them being obnoxious to the point where you turn this off... they're interesting jerks, and that makes up for it) and their situation. The music by Ennio Morricone is excellent, and really fits the mood and tone. There is a lot of disturbing content and strong language, a little blood, nudity and sexuality in this. The DVD comes with a trailer(for this). I recommend this to any fan of those responsible for making it, and/or of filthy crime-drama-thrillers set in the middle of nowhere. 7/10
