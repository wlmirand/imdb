  Captain Kirk and his crew must deal with Mr. Spock's long-lost half-brother who hijacks the Enterprise for an obsessive search for God at the center of the galaxy.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  When the newly-christened starship Enterprise's shakedown cruise goes poorly, Captain Kirk and crew put it into Spacedock for repairs. But an urgent mission interrupts their Earth-bound shore leave. A renegade Vulcan named Sybok has taken three consuls hostage on the planet Nimbus III, an event which also attracts the attention of a Klingon captain who wants to make a name for himself. Sybok's ragtag army captures the Enterprise and takes it on a journey to the center of the galaxy in search of the Supreme Being.

    All of you Star Trek fans out there can argue that the first Star Trek was a lackluster start to a successful franchise, but that's not the case here. While the previous three were were very good and vast improvements over the first film, this entry is easily lackluster. Not exactly terrible, but just an example of a film that caused a successful franchise to go downhill like most other films in Hollywood history. There are some good stuff, however, before I can get to the flaws. The cast from the previous films did their best for what they were given from an otherwise terrible script. The music score is decent; the visuals and scenery are nice to look at and the special effects are pretty good. Now to the negatives. The script, like I said before, is terrible and the story is contrived with several plot holes that go absolutely nowhere, the dialog is cringe-worthy, the pacing is very sluggish, and the direction is a bit choppy. Overall, not terrible nor good, but a lackluster entry to the series.

    Star Trek 5: The Final Frontier is a decent movie,it isn't awful but it is the worst Star Trek movie,and it shows that directing really isn't William Shatner's thing,he obviously decided since Leonard Nimoy directed the previous two Star Trek movies,but he didn't do nearly as good as Nimoy.The movies story seemed very promising,but it ended being very little story and a lot of not very entertaining action sequences.The only thing that really made this movie enjoyable was,like usual for Star Trek,the cast is brilliant,and I also was surprised with how much I enjoyed the ending.I don't think that the Final Frontier is awful but it's without a doubt the worst Star Trek and fans of the franchise will be very disappointing. Captain Kirk must take on Spock's half brother Sybock,who seizes the Enterprise to travel to space's final frontier to find the Almighty.

    Star Trek V: The Final Frontier ** (out of 4) 107 mins/ PG Cast: William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan, Walter Koeing, Nichelle Nichols, George Takei, David Warner, Laurence Luckinbill Director: William Shatner Plot: The enterprise is hijacked by Spock's half-brother, who wants to use it to reach the holy land of God. JJ's Verdict: Star Trek V: The Final Frontier is undoubtedly the worst of the Original Cast's films. It starts off with a strange opening in a desert, in which a Vulcan manages to get some peculiar looking planet inhabitant, to join him by hugging the fellow. This is not well explained at all and leaves you confused as the Vulcan's situation moves towards civilisation. Jump to a forest where, (ironically) DeForest Kelley is looking at William Shatner climbing a mountain for no valid reason, Leonard Nimoy ascending the mountain on booster shoes for no valid reason and Shatner then falling down the mountain for no valid reason and then being caught by Nimoy who manages to save his friend without even touching him. It is awful logic like this, which just makes it, pure and simply, a bad film. The effects still look poor and homemade and there are some bad slapstick humour and some horribly cheesy one-liners and jokes. The villain, an okay Laurence Luckinbill, can brainwash anyone to join his pilgrimage to God, which begs the question; if you can brainwash anyone then why not use it to get rich or achieve world domination? No, he'd just rather travel forever to find somewhere no one has ever found before, so he can talk to God. The character isn't even comparable to Ricardo Montablon and Christopher Lloyd who have played previous Trek villains extremely well. And it turns out in the end, that he isn't even bad! The crew themselves, really show off their age in some of the action scenes and it is quite worrying to see how much weight some of them have put on. The film isn't all-bad though. The lighter approach in places makes way for some good buddy humour between the three leads and the cinematography is very good. In one part of the film, we get to see the whole of the Enterprise's interior  which is pretty cool  and James Doohan puts in a perfectly timed comic performance. As director, I don't think Shatner did a bad job, just not a good job either! The storyline is poor and although watchable this is just too cringing, and they were very lucky that The Final Frontier wasn't so and the crew returned in 1991.

    I remember going to the cinema to see this first time around, and was thoroughly 'meh' about it in all honesty. I didn't hate it, I didn't love it, and certainly after following The Voyage Home, Final Frontier felt like a massive step backwards. The whole God notion didn't really interest me much then, it seemed such a silly premise, that later we discover in the movie its not God at all is beside the point, many people were turned off from seeing the movie in the first place, because whilst many people believe in God, they probably never actually want to see God, and certainly not a silly sci- fi movies interpretation of God either. Sybok as the main villain...... turns out he's not really a villain at all, but I felt the whole 'Sybok is Spocks brother' storyline was a bit too much soap opera for me. There was never any allusion to Spock having a brother, and for it to be brought up after all this time, just felt too tacked on. Other characters were shortchanged and had virtually no character development, especially the three that were trapped on Nimbus, held captive by Sybok. The one saving grace for the entire movie though, was the camaraderie of the three main characters. I didn't really appreciate it first time around, but more so now, I found myself laughing and smiling, the interaction of Kirk, Spock and Bones at various parts really helped lift the movie, and its one of the few things that helped prevent the movie being drab and boring. The VFX are long held up as being not the best, but to be honest, with the exception of the horrible matte lines around the Enterprise when it was in front of the blue clouds of Shakaree, for the most part, I didn't really notice any problems. Certainly there are elements of Wrath of Khan with similar scenes that don't hold up so well and that was ILM in charge of effects. Final Frontier isn't a bad film, its simply an OK one, and thats really not good enough for Star Trek, and thankfully this wasn't the last movie the original crew did as this would not have been a fitting send off for them. I think they backed themselves in a corner by approaching the 'God' question which simply put a lot of people off, but there is still enough recognisable Trek in it that its not a disaster. Its such a shame that having found big success with The Voyage Home, Paramount slashed the budget on this one, because by all accounts, the original ending was supposed to be far more satisfactory.

    The majority of Trekkies will tell you that "The Final Frontier" is the worst Star Trek movie. Some of the Next Generation movies were bad, but none quite so incompetently put together as this one. The tone is inconsistent, the special effects are shoddy, the plot is weak, the climax is anticlimactic. But for all that, it captures the adventurous spirit of the original show better than any of the other films in the series. A few things stood out to me the last time I watched it. First, the red toy-soldier uniforms look more out-of-place than ever; I kept expecting to see the classic costumes, which would have been more appropriate than the movies' military duds. Second, Captain Kirk sports blue jeans and a flannel shirt in the campfire scenes, as if they took place in the 20th century instead of the 23rd. Finally, the Klingon antagonists seem to have arrived from a different movie only to cause trouble. Where "The Final Frontier" absolutely nails the source material is in its combination of humor, action, metaphysics, and warm characterization. It probably has the best moments between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy of any of the films -- especially since the previous three movies rarely got these iconic character together. Sybok's quest for god may be a little too heavy, but at least it has ambitions. Sybok turns out to be one of the more memorable Star Trek villains: a deluded cult leader on a monomaniacal mission to discover the Garden of Eden, who ultimately realizes where he went wrong and redeems himself in the final reel. None of Trek's other cinematic enemies can boast that sort of dramatic arc. It sounds funny, but I think it might be one of the best Star Trek movies after all.

    As with most of my reviews at the moment i have seen this film a few times before, though i have tried to avoid it. It had always been the worst Trek film in my book. However, having watched it for the first time in ten years today, it is actually tolerable and possibly pushes 'The Motion Picture', alongside some of the TNG films, as the worst. The basic premise if the film is that Spock's half brother Sybok, seeks to find God. I guess as another reviewer has stated, maybe in 100 years this film will be looked upon as a classic but, my word, present day makes it a poor film. The comedy of IV: The Voyage Home was subtle and funny but in this it seems forced. I have to say though, there are a couple of laugh out loud moments mainly coming form McCoy. On the other side of the coin McCoy gives one of the most emotional performances of the film during the moments when he regrets the death of his Father. Apart from that there is a lack of caring for the crew. Something seems to be missing, it really is hard to put your finger on it. There is a lack, dare i say it, nearly no confrontational moments of the film. It is more of a thinking film, like The Motion Picture, really. Thank the lord the re was some aggression and cliffhanging moments in the next film The Undiscovered COuntry. Scotty, Uhuru and Zulu are totally underused. In fact you could have had the film without them and it wouldn't have made much difference. A note however to Scotty's "I know this ship like the back of my hand" line. Kirk, doesn't really feel like the Kirk we love, maybe this is down to him having to concentrate on directing. Having said all that, it is watchable. It has no baring on the rest of the films however. You could easily miss this one out if out wanted. Considerng this featured the maiden voyage of the Enterprise A, it is sadly not even really touched upon, and there is no great fanfare moment that sticks in the memory like the TMP Enterprise refit reveal. There are some cringe-worthy moments, like a hint of romance between Uhuru and Scotty and the evil laughter of Sybok at the start of the film. You grow to like Sybok in the film as his character never really is/becomes a baddie and his redemption at the end of the film is touching. Anything that takes away from the moments when you are watching the so called God, helps! Great to here the TMP Jerry Goldsmith theme once again but the overall soundtrack doesn't stand out at all. To be honest, you will be glad when the film is over. Leave it a decade then watch it again and it is a nice trip down memory lane! Rumour has it that the poor performance of this film nearly killed the franchise. Thankfully it did continue but in the order of things, this could be deleted out of the series and no one would mind.

    What the hell? How could a film like these be made after the others without there being sign of collapsing but there wasn't. Some things were fun and enjoyable, but most was weird and dumb to watch. This film was one I forgot most of but I guess should as there is not much to remember, but there was a part of me that could tell it was bad but was satisfied a little anyway. The camping was fun, the Morse code for move was fun too but not the main bad guy. They were lazy with that. Shatner could have done worse, but could have been better with just Nimoy as the man for the job instead. Don't see it. It adds nothing and takes some from the series.

    When hearing news such as 'Star Trek V' being the worst of the bunch- even worse than the first, I cannot help but have the lowest expectations for a film like this. A plot that is called ridiculous, characters that are called uninteresting and a film that is regarded as the most unnecessary addition to this franchise makes for clearly low expectations. I absolutely hate the first Star Trek movie. It was paced horrendously, the characters were extremely one dimensional and the story was not immersive. It truly was one of the worst franchise openers and I wasn't looking forward to the next ones. Gladly, the trilogy that followed was fantastic! Critics such as legend Roger Ebert have stated this is the worst of the bunch so I went in with the most horrible expectations and surprisingly, this movie shocked me in a good way! I honestly don't get the complaints given to this film. Sure, it isn't a great film but it had a story that was decent, some good characters and added a bit of depth to a few of the characters and provided a few emotional scenes. Sure, the ending to this film was unsatisfying and sure the story was ridiculous but I find this to be a guilty pleasure. The movie truly suffers with some ridiculous scenes at times such as singing 'Row, row, row your boat' and a glimpse at a romance between Scotty and Uhura but for the most part, the story was rather well done and it had a few good moments. The film's pacing is good and I thought that William Shatner did a good job at directing this film considering how much stress it could've been to play a main character and be the director. I know Mel Gibson did it with Braveheart! Despite being a guilty pleasure, I can understand how people say that this film truly was an unnecessary sequel. It doesn't offer much new content apart from a scene where we discover a bit about Bones' past. That scene was well done and provided some emotional depth to his character. People say that this film isn't funny. They say the comedic level of this film is extremely low compared with the previous trilogy. I agree but the comedy still works in this film unlike in the original film. The acting was mostly good and the new characters did a good job, especially the character of Sybok, whom I particularly liked. Star Trek V: The Final Frontier is one of those movies I'd take as a guilty pleasure and an unnecessary addition to the Star Trek franchise yet certainly an enjoyable and fun film. This film truly has gotten better as time passed by. Back in 1989, it was viewed ridiculous and I am a little understanding of that, but by 2013, that so called horrid mess this film was has been forgotten with some fantastic sequels to this so called atrocity.

    After a good, successful run of four films, William Shatner himself steps in to direct the fifth Star Trek feature film. With the title of The Final Frontier, and with the premise of a God-seeking adventure, you'd think this would be the most epic and profound Trek movie of the lot. Sadly, as of the time of this writing, it's considered the worst Trek movie of the series, and for some viewers, it might even be ranked as one of the worst movies of all time. Even I won't deny that the film has its issues. The special effects are strangely gaudy in this film, lacking in refinement or quality. The acting is at its cheesiest, with jokes and anecdotes thrown out profusely throughout the picture. Most viewers will also take issue with Sybok's character - you'll find out why about halfway through the picture - and the overall plot, which comes off as messy and directionless. The film is not without charm, however. I personally always enjoyed the comedic antics of the three main characters, especially during the opening mountain climbing scenes and during their madcap pursuits in the Enterprise's interior. Action is frequent and will be pleasing for non-discerning Trek fans. As ambitious as the story is, it runs through a rather formulaic plot, with little room for quality character development. Themes should be present, but generally aren't. It's as straightforward and simple as a Trek movie can be. This film is captured with okay, never great, photography and editing. Acting and writing in this picture is never a serious affair; the script gets the job done, but after so many revisions, it has undoubtedly lost something along the way. The cast members do the best they can with their material. Similarly, the sets, props, costumes, and special effects do their best to make the picture work, but are not without weaknesses. Music might be the biggest standout here. The fifth Star Trek film never struck me as being a terrible film, for I have found it enjoyable. However, it is a haphazardly-constructed film with issues that most viewers will find distasteful. Trek fans might want to check this out once, but for everybody else, not recommended. 3.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Average | Film: Average)

    Despite how so many people think that this movie is flawed, I still like this movie because it talks about our place in the universe and with its Yosemite scenes teaches us to respect the environment. I enjoyed this movie and how they went to a God Planet near the center of our galaxy in the direction of Sagittarius the Archer. This movie had an astrophysics consultant on the location of the "God Planet" and they chose the center of our galaxy. I like how this movie commented on religion and how flawed it can be and the "God" villain had one voice and many faces which makes sense. I also love the "Cosmic Thoughts" scene near the end of the movie. This movie is a paradigm to the glory of Star Trek about searching outside in the universe and inside our minds.

Sybok turns out to be one of the more memorable Star Trek villains: a deluded cult leader on a monomaniacal mission to discover the Garden of Eden, who ultimately realizes where he went wrong and redeems himself in the final reel. None of Trek's other cinematic enemies can boast that sort of dramatic arc. It sounds funny, but I think it might be one of the best Star Trek movies after all.

    As with most of my reviews at the moment i have seen this film a few times before, though i have tried to avoid it. It had always been the worst Trek film in my book. However, having watched it for the first time in ten years today, it is actually tolerable and possibly pushes 'The Motion Picture', alongside some of the TNG films, as the worst. The basic premise if the film is that Spock's half brother Sybok, seeks to find God. I guess as another reviewer has stated, maybe in 100 years this film will be looked upon as a classic but, my word, present day makes it a poor film. The comedy of IV: The Voyage Home was subtle and funny but in this it seems forced. I have to say though, there are a couple of laugh out loud moments mainly coming form McCoy. On the other side of the coin McCoy gives one of the most emotional performances of the film during the moments when he regrets the death of his Father. Apart from that there is a lack of caring for the crew. Something seems to be missing, it really is hard to put your finger on it. There is a lack, dare i say it, nearly no confrontational moments of the film. It is more of a thinking film, like The Motion Picture, really. Thank the lord the re was some aggression and cliffhanging moments in the next film The Undiscovered COuntry. Scotty, Uhuru and Zulu are totally underused. In fact you could have had the film without them and it wouldn't have made much difference. A note however to Scotty's "I know this ship like the back of my hand" line. Kirk, doesn't really feel like the Kirk we love, maybe this is down to him having to concentrate on directing. Having said all that, it is watchable. It has no baring on the rest of the films however. You could easily miss this one out if out wanted. Considerng this featured the maiden voyage of the Enterprise A, it is sadly not even really touched upon, and there is no great fanfare moment that sticks in the memory like the TMP Enterprise refit reveal. There are some cringe-worthy moments, like a hint of romance between Uhuru and Scotty and the evil laughter of Sybok at the start of the film. You grow to like Sybok in the film as his character never really is/becomes a baddie and his redemption at the end of the film is touching. Anything that takes away from the moments when you are watching the so called God, helps! Great to here the TMP Jerry Goldsmith theme once again but the overall soundtrack doesn't stand out at all. To be honest, you will be glad when the film is over. Leave it a decade then watch it again and it is a nice trip down memory lane! Rumour has it that the poor performance of this film nearly killed the franchise. Thankfully it did continue but in the order of things, this could be deleted out of the series and no one would mind.

    What the hell? How could a film like these be made after the others without there being sign of collapsing but there wasn't. Some things were fun and enjoyable, but most was weird and dumb to watch. This film was one I forgot most of but I guess should as there is not much to remember, but there was a part of me that could tell it was bad but was satisfied a little anyway. The camping was fun, the Morse code for move was fun too but not the main bad guy. They were lazy with that. Shatner could have done worse, but could have been better with just Nimoy as the man for the job instead. Don't see it. It adds nothing and takes some from the series.

    When hearing news such as 'Star Trek V' being the worst of the bunch- even worse than the first, I cannot help but have the lowest expectations for a film like this. A plot that is called ridiculous, characters that are called uninteresting and a film that is regarded as the most unnecessary addition to this franchise makes for clearly low expectations. I absolutely hate the first Star Trek movie. It was paced horrendously, the characters were extremely one dimensional and the story was not immersive. It truly was one of the worst franchise openers and I wasn't looking forward to the next ones. Gladly, the trilogy that followed was fantastic! Critics such as legend Roger Ebert have stated this is the worst of the bunch so I went in with the most horrible expectations and surprisingly, this movie shocked me in a good way! I honestly don't get the complaints given to this film. Sure, it isn't a great film but it had a story that was decent, some good characters and added a bit of depth to a few of the characters and provided a few emotional scenes. Sure, the ending to this film was unsatisfying and sure the story was ridiculous but I find this to be a guilty pleasure. The movie truly suffers with some ridiculous scenes at times such as singing 'Row, row, row your boat' and a glimpse at a romance between Scotty and Uhura but for the most part, the story was rather well done and it had a few good moments. The film's pacing is good and I thought that William Shatner did a good job at directing this film considering how much stress it could've been to play a main character and be the director. I know Mel Gibson did it with Braveheart! Despite being a guilty pleasure, I can understand how people say that this film truly was an unnecessary sequel. It doesn't offer much new content apart from a scene where we discover a bit about Bones' past. That scene was well done and provided some emotional depth to his character. People say that this film isn't funny. They say the comedic level of this film is extremely low compared with the previous trilogy. I agree but the comedy still works in this film unlike in the original film. The acting was mostly good and the new characters did a good job, especially the character of Sybok, whom I particularly liked. Star Trek V: The Final Frontier is one of those movies I'd take as a guilty pleasure and an unnecessary addition to the Star Trek franchise yet certainly an enjoyable and fun film. This film truly has gotten better as time passed by. Back in 1989, it was viewed ridiculous and I am a little understanding of that, but by 2013, that so called horrid mess this film was has been forgotten with some fantastic sequels to this so called atrocity.

    After a good, successful run of four films, William Shatner himself steps in to direct the fifth Star Trek feature film. With the title of The Final Frontier, and with the premise of a God-seeking adventure, you'd think this would be the most epic and profound Trek movie of the lot. Sadly, as of the time of this writing, it's considered the worst Trek movie of the series, and for some viewers, it might even be ranked as one of the worst movies of all time. Even I won't deny that the film has its issues. The special effects are strangely gaudy in this film, lacking in refinement or quality. The acting is at its cheesiest, with jokes and anecdotes thrown out profusely throughout the picture. Most viewers will also take issue with Sybok's character - you'll find out why about halfway through the picture - and the overall plot, which comes off as messy and directionless. The film is not without charm, however. I personally always enjoyed the comedic antics of the three main characters, especially during the opening mountain climbing scenes and during their madcap pursuits in the Enterprise's interior. Action is frequent and will be pleasing for non-discerning Trek fans. As ambitious as the story is, it runs through a rather formulaic plot, with little room for quality character development. Themes should be present, but generally aren't. It's as straightforward and simple as a Trek movie can be. This film is captured with okay, never great, photography and editing. Acting and writing in this picture is never a serious affair; the script gets the job done, but after so many revisions, it has undoubtedly lost something along the way. The cast members do the best they can with their material. Similarly, the sets, props, costumes, and special effects do their best to make the picture work, but are not without weaknesses. Music might be the biggest standout here. The fifth Star Trek film never struck me as being a terrible film, for I have found it enjoyable. However, it is a haphazardly-constructed film with issues that most viewers will find distasteful. Trek fans might want to check this out once, but for everybody else, not recommended. 3.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Average | Film: Average)

    Despite how so many people think that this movie is flawed, I still like this movie because it talks about our place in the universe and with its Yosemite scenes teaches us to respect the environment. I enjoyed this movie and how they went to a God Planet near the center of our galaxy in the direction of Sagittarius the Archer. This movie had an astrophysics consultant on the location of the "God Planet" and they chose the center of our galaxy. I like how this movie commented on religion and how flawed it can be and the "God" villain had one voice and many faces which makes sense. I also love the "Cosmic Thoughts" scene near the end of the movie. This movie is a paradigm to the glory of Star Trek about searching outside in the universe and inside our minds.

    All of you Star Trek fans out there can argue that the first Star Trek was a lackluster start to a successful franchise, but that's not the case here. While the previous three were were very good and vast improvements over the first film, this entry is easily lackluster. Not exactly terrible, but just an example of a film that caused a successful franchise to go downhill like most other films in Hollywood history. There are some good stuff, however, before I can get to the flaws. The cast from the previous films did their best for what they were given from an otherwise terrible script. The music score is decent; the visuals and scenery are nice to look at and the special effects are pretty good. Now to the negatives. The script, like I said before, is terrible and the story is contrived with several plot holes that go absolutely nowhere, the dialog is cringe-worthy, the pacing is very sluggish, and the direction is a bit choppy. Overall, not terrible nor good, but a lackluster entry to the series.

    Star Trek 5: The Final Frontier is a decent movie,it isn't awful but it is the worst Star Trek movie,and it shows that directing really isn't William Shatner's thing,he obviously decided since Leonard Nimoy directed the previous two Star Trek movies,but he didn't do nearly as good as Nimoy.The movies story seemed very promising,but it ended being very little story and a lot of not very entertaining action sequences.The only thing that really made this movie enjoyable was,like usual for Star Trek,the cast is brilliant,and I also was surprised with how much I enjoyed the ending.I don't think that the Final Frontier is awful but it's without a doubt the worst Star Trek and fans of the franchise will be very disappointing. Captain Kirk must take on Spock's half brother Sybock,who seizes the Enterprise to travel to space's final frontier to find the Almighty.

    Star Trek V: The Final Frontier ** (out of 4) 107 mins/ PG Cast: William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan, Walter Koeing, Nichelle Nichols, George Takei, David Warner, Laurence Luckinbill Director: William Shatner Plot: The enterprise is hijacked by Spock's half-brother, who wants to use it to reach the holy land of God. JJ's Verdict: Star Trek V: The Final Frontier is undoubtedly the worst of the Original Cast's films. It starts off with a strange opening in a desert, in which a Vulcan manages to get some peculiar looking planet inhabitant, to join him by hugging the fellow. This is not well explained at all and leaves you confused as the Vulcan's situation moves towards civilisation. Jump to a forest where, (ironically) DeForest Kelley is looking at William Shatner climbing a mountain for no valid reason, Leonard Nimoy ascending the mountain on booster shoes for no valid reason and Shatner then falling down the mountain for no valid reason and then being caught by Nimoy who manages to save his friend without even touching him. It is awful logic like this, which just makes it, pure and simply, a bad film. The effects still look poor and homemade and there are some bad slapstick humour and some horribly cheesy one-liners and jokes. The villain, an okay Laurence Luckinbill, can brainwash anyone to join his pilgrimage to God, which begs the question; if you can brainwash anyone then why not use it to get rich or achieve world domination? No, he'd just rather travel forever to find somewhere no one has ever found before, so he can talk to God. The character isn't even comparable to Ricardo Montablon and Christopher Lloyd who have played previous Trek villains extremely well. And it turns out in the end, that he isn't even bad! The crew themselves, really show off their age in some of the action scenes and it is quite worrying to see how much weight some of them have put on. The film isn't all-bad though. The lighter approach in places makes way for some good buddy humour between the three leads and the cinematography is very good. In one part of the film, we get to see the whole of the Enterprise's interior  which is pretty cool  and James Doohan puts in a perfectly timed comic performance. As director, I don't think Shatner did a bad job, just not a good job either! The storyline is poor and although watchable this is just too cringing, and they were very lucky that The Final Frontier wasn't so and the crew returned in 1991.

    I remember going to the cinema to see this first time around, and was thoroughly 'meh' about it in all honesty. I didn't hate it, I didn't love it, and certainly after following The Voyage Home, Final Frontier felt like a massive step backwards. The whole God notion didn't really interest me much then, it seemed such a silly premise, that later we discover in the movie its not God at all is beside the point, many people were turned off from seeing the movie in the first place, because whilst many people believe in God, they probably never actually want to see God, and certainly not a silly sci- fi movies interpretation of God either. Sybok as the main villain...... turns out he's not really a villain at all, but I felt the whole 'Sybok is Spocks brother' storyline was a bit too much soap opera for me. There was never any allusion to Spock having a brother, and for it to be brought up after all this time, just felt too tacked on. Other characters were shortchanged and had virtually no character development, especially the three that were trapped on Nimbus, held captive by Sybok. The one saving grace for the entire movie though, was the camaraderie of the three main characters. I didn't really appreciate it first time around, but more so now, I found myself laughing and smiling, the interaction of Kirk, Spock and Bones at various parts really helped lift the movie, and its one of the few things that helped prevent the movie being drab and boring. The VFX are long held up as being not the best, but to be honest, with the exception of the horrible matte lines around the Enterprise when it was in front of the blue clouds of Shakaree, for the most part, I didn't really notice any problems. Certainly there are elements of Wrath of Khan with similar scenes that don't hold up so well and that was ILM in charge of effects. Final Frontier isn't a bad film, its simply an OK one, and thats really not good enough for Star Trek, and thankfully this wasn't the last movie the original crew did as this would not have been a fitting send off for them. I think they backed themselves in a corner by approaching the 'God' question which simply put a lot of people off, but there is still enough recognisable Trek in it that its not a disaster. Its such a shame that having found big success with The Voyage Home, Paramount slashed the budget on this one, because by all accounts, the original ending was supposed to be far more satisfactory.

    The majority of Trekkies will tell you that "The Final Frontier" is the worst Star Trek movie. Some of the Next Generation movies were bad, but none quite so incompetently put together as this one. The tone is inconsistent, the special effects are shoddy, the plot is weak, the climax is anticlimactic. But for all that, it captures the adventurous spirit of the original show better than any of the other films in the series. A few things stood out to me the last time I watched it. First, the red toy-soldier uniforms look more out-of-place than ever; I kept expecting to see the classic costumes, which would have been more appropriate than the movies' military duds. Second, Captain Kirk sports blue jeans and a flannel shirt in the campfire scenes, as if they took place in the 20th century instead of the 23rd. Finally, the Klingon antagonists seem to have arrived from a different movie only to cause trouble. Where "The Final Frontier" absolutely nails the source material is in its combination of humor, action, metaphysics, and warm characterization. It probably has the best moments between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy of any of the films -- especially since the previous three movies rarely got these iconic character together. Sybok's quest for god may be a little too heavy, but at least it has ambitions. Sybok turns out to be one of the more memorable Star Trek villains: a deluded cult leader on a monomaniacal mission to discover the Garden of Eden, who ultimately realizes where he went wrong and redeems himself in the final reel. None of Trek's other cinematic enemies can boast that sort of dramatic arc. It sounds funny, but I think it might be one of the best Star Trek movies after all.

The music score is decent; the visuals and scenery are nice to look at and the special effects are pretty good. Now to the negatives. The script, like I said before, is terrible and the story is contrived with several plot holes that go absolutely nowhere, the dialog is cringe-worthy, the pacing is very sluggish, and the direction is a bit choppy. Overall, not terrible nor good, but a lackluster entry to the series.

    Star Trek 5: The Final Frontier is a decent movie,it isn't awful but it is the worst Star Trek movie,and it shows that directing really isn't William Shatner's thing,he obviously decided since Leonard Nimoy directed the previous two Star Trek movies,but he didn't do nearly as good as Nimoy.The movies story seemed very promising,but it ended being very little story and a lot of not very entertaining action sequences.The only thing that really made this movie enjoyable was,like usual for Star Trek,the cast is brilliant,and I also was surprised with how much I enjoyed the ending.I don't think that the Final Frontier is awful but it's without a doubt the worst Star Trek and fans of the franchise will be very disappointing. Captain Kirk must take on Spock's half brother Sybock,who seizes the Enterprise to travel to space's final frontier to find the Almighty.

    Star Trek V: The Final Frontier ** (out of 4) 107 mins/ PG Cast: William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan, Walter Koeing, Nichelle Nichols, George Takei, David Warner, Laurence Luckinbill Director: William Shatner Plot: The enterprise is hijacked by Spock's half-brother, who wants to use it to reach the holy land of God. JJ's Verdict: Star Trek V: The Final Frontier is undoubtedly the worst of the Original Cast's films. It starts off with a strange opening in a desert, in which a Vulcan manages to get some peculiar looking planet inhabitant, to join him by hugging the fellow. This is not well explained at all and leaves you confused as the Vulcan's situation moves towards civilisation. Jump to a forest where, (ironically) DeForest Kelley is looking at William Shatner climbing a mountain for no valid reason, Leonard Nimoy ascending the mountain on booster shoes for no valid reason and Shatner then falling down the mountain for no valid reason and then being caught by Nimoy who manages to save his friend without even touching him. It is awful logic like this, which just makes it, pure and simply, a bad film. The effects still look poor and homemade and there are some bad slapstick humour and some horribly cheesy one-liners and jokes. The villain, an okay Laurence Luckinbill, can brainwash anyone to join his pilgrimage to God, which begs the question; if you can brainwash anyone then why not use it to get rich or achieve world domination? No, he'd just rather travel forever to find somewhere no one has ever found before, so he can talk to God. The character isn't even comparable to Ricardo Montablon and Christopher Lloyd who have played previous Trek villains extremely well. And it turns out in the end, that he isn't even bad! The crew themselves, really show off their age in some of the action scenes and it is quite worrying to see how much weight some of them have put on. The film isn't all-bad though. The lighter approach in places makes way for some good buddy humour between the three leads and the cinematography is very good. In one part of the film, we get to see the whole of the Enterprise's interior  which is pretty cool  and James Doohan puts in a perfectly timed comic performance. As director, I don't think Shatner did a bad job, just not a good job either! The storyline is poor and although watchable this is just too cringing, and they were very lucky that The Final Frontier wasn't so and the crew returned in 1991.

    I remember going to the cinema to see this first time around, and was thoroughly 'meh' about it in all honesty. I didn't hate it, I didn't love it, and certainly after following The Voyage Home, Final Frontier felt like a massive step backwards. The whole God notion didn't really interest me much then, it seemed such a silly premise, that later we discover in the movie its not God at all is beside the point, many people were turned off from seeing the movie in the first place, because whilst many people believe in God, they probably never actually want to see God, and certainly not a silly sci- fi movies interpretation of God either. Sybok as the main villain...... turns out he's not really a villain at all, but I felt the whole 'Sybok is Spocks brother' storyline was a bit too much soap opera for me. There was never any allusion to Spock having a brother, and for it to be brought up after all this time, just felt too tacked on. Other characters were shortchanged and had virtually no character development, especially the three that were trapped on Nimbus, held captive by Sybok. The one saving grace for the entire movie though, was the camaraderie of the three main characters. I didn't really appreciate it first time around, but more so now, I found myself laughing and smiling, the interaction of Kirk, Spock and Bones at various parts really helped lift the movie, and its one of the few things that helped prevent the movie being drab and boring. The VFX are long held up as being not the best, but to be honest, with the exception of the horrible matte lines around the Enterprise when it was in front of the blue clouds of Shakaree, for the most part, I didn't really notice any problems. Certainly there are elements of Wrath of Khan with similar scenes that don't hold up so well and that was ILM in charge of effects. Final Frontier isn't a bad film, its simply an OK one, and thats really not good enough for Star Trek, and thankfully this wasn't the last movie the original crew did as this would not have been a fitting send off for them. I think they backed themselves in a corner by approaching the 'God' question which simply put a lot of people off, but there is still enough recognisable Trek in it that its not a disaster. Its such a shame that having found big success with The Voyage Home, Paramount slashed the budget on this one, because by all accounts, the original ending was supposed to be far more satisfactory.

    The majority of Trekkies will tell you that "The Final Frontier" is the worst Star Trek movie. Some of the Next Generation movies were bad, but none quite so incompetently put together as this one. The tone is inconsistent, the special effects are shoddy, the plot is weak, the climax is anticlimactic. But for all that, it captures the adventurous spirit of the original show better than any of the other films in the series. A few things stood out to me the last time I watched it. First, the red toy-soldier uniforms look more out-of-place than ever; I kept expecting to see the classic costumes, which would have been more appropriate than the movies' military duds. Second, Captain Kirk sports blue jeans and a flannel shirt in the campfire scenes, as if they took place in the 20th century instead of the 23rd. Finally, the Klingon antagonists seem to have arrived from a different movie only to cause trouble. Where "The Final Frontier" absolutely nails the source material is in its combination of humor, action, metaphysics, and warm characterization. It probably has the best moments between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy of any of the films -- especially since the previous three movies rarely got these iconic character together. Sybok's quest for god may be a little too heavy, but at least it has ambitions. Sybok turns out to be one of the more memorable Star Trek villains: a deluded cult leader on a monomaniacal mission to discover the Garden of Eden, who ultimately realizes where he went wrong and redeems himself in the final reel. None of Trek's other cinematic enemies can boast that sort of dramatic arc. It sounds funny, but I think it might be one of the best Star Trek movies after all.

    As with most of my reviews at the moment i have seen this film a few times before, though i have tried to avoid it. It had always been the worst Trek film in my book. However, having watched it for the first time in ten years today, it is actually tolerable and possibly pushes 'The Motion Picture', alongside some of the TNG films, as the worst. The basic premise if the film is that Spock's half brother Sybok, seeks to find God. I guess as another reviewer has stated, maybe in 100 years this film will be looked upon as a classic but, my word, present day makes it a poor film. The comedy of IV: The Voyage Home was subtle and funny but in this it seems forced. I have to say though, there are a couple of laugh out loud moments mainly coming form McCoy. On the other side of the coin McCoy gives one of the most emotional performances of the film during the moments when he regrets the death of his Father. Apart from that there is a lack of caring for the crew. Something seems to be missing, it really is hard to put your finger on it. There is a lack, dare i say it, nearly no confrontational moments of the film. It is more of a thinking film, like The Motion Picture, really. Thank the lord the re was some aggression and cliffhanging moments in the next film The Undiscovered COuntry. Scotty, Uhuru and Zulu are totally underused. In fact you could have had the film without them and it wouldn't have made much difference. A note however to Scotty's "I know this ship like the back of my hand" line. Kirk, doesn't really feel like the Kirk we love, maybe this is down to him having to concentrate on directing. Having said all that, it is watchable. It has no baring on the rest of the films however. You could easily miss this one out if out wanted. Considerng this featured the maiden voyage of the Enterprise A, it is sadly not even really touched upon, and there is no great fanfare moment that sticks in the memory like the TMP Enterprise refit reveal. There are some cringe-worthy moments, like a hint of romance between Uhuru and Scotty and the evil laughter of Sybok at the start of the film. You grow to like Sybok in the film as his character never really is/becomes a baddie and his redemption at the end of the film is touching. Anything that takes away from the moments when you are watching the so called God, helps! Great to here the TMP Jerry Goldsmith theme once again but the overall soundtrack doesn't stand out at all. To be honest, you will be glad when the film is over. Leave it a decade then watch it again and it is a nice trip down memory lane! Rumour has it that the poor performance of this film nearly killed the franchise. Thankfully it did continue but in the order of things, this could be deleted out of the series and no one would mind.

    What the hell? How could a film like these be made after the others without there being sign of collapsing but there wasn't. Some things were fun and enjoyable, but most was weird and dumb to watch. This film was one I forgot most of but I guess should as there is not much to remember, but there was a part of me that could tell it was bad but was satisfied a little anyway. The camping was fun, the Morse code for move was fun too but not the main bad guy. They were lazy with that. Shatner could have done worse, but could have been better with just Nimoy as the man for the job instead. Don't see it. It adds nothing and takes some from the series.

    When hearing news such as 'Star Trek V' being the worst of the bunch- even worse than the first, I cannot help but have the lowest expectations for a film like this. A plot that is called ridiculous, characters that are called uninteresting and a film that is regarded as the most unnecessary addition to this franchise makes for clearly low expectations. I absolutely hate the first Star Trek movie. It was paced horrendously, the characters were extremely one dimensional and the story was not immersive. It truly was one of the worst franchise openers and I wasn't looking forward to the next ones. Gladly, the trilogy that followed was fantastic! Critics such as legend Roger Ebert have stated this is the worst of the bunch so I went in with the most horrible expectations and surprisingly, this movie shocked me in a good way! I honestly don't get the complaints given to this film. Sure, it isn't a great film but it had a story that was decent, some good characters and added a bit of depth to a few of the characters and provided a few emotional scenes. Sure, the ending to this film was unsatisfying and sure the story was ridiculous but I find this to be a guilty pleasure. The movie truly suffers with some ridiculous scenes at times such as singing 'Row, row, row your boat' and a glimpse at a romance between Scotty and Uhura but for the most part, the story was rather well done and it had a few good moments. The film's pacing is good and I thought that William Shatner did a good job at directing this film considering how much stress it could've been to play a main character and be the director. I know Mel Gibson did it with Braveheart! Despite being a guilty pleasure, I can understand how people say that this film truly was an unnecessary sequel. It doesn't offer much new content apart from a scene where we discover a bit about Bones' past. That scene was well done and provided some emotional depth to his character. People say that this film isn't funny. They say the comedic level of this film is extremely low compared with the previous trilogy. I agree but the comedy still works in this film unlike in the original film. The acting was mostly good and the new characters did a good job, especially the character of Sybok, whom I particularly liked. Star Trek V: The Final Frontier is one of those movies I'd take as a guilty pleasure and an unnecessary addition to the Star Trek franchise yet certainly an enjoyable and fun film. This film truly has gotten better as time passed by. Back in 1989, it was viewed ridiculous and I am a little understanding of that, but by 2013, that so called horrid mess this film was has been forgotten with some fantastic sequels to this so called atrocity.

    After a good, successful run of four films, William Shatner himself steps in to direct the fifth Star Trek feature film. With the title of The Final Frontier, and with the premise of a God-seeking adventure, you'd think this would be the most epic and profound Trek movie of the lot. Sadly, as of the time of this writing, it's considered the worst Trek movie of the series, and for some viewers, it might even be ranked as one of the worst movies of all time. Even I won't deny that the film has its issues. The special effects are strangely gaudy in this film, lacking in refinement or quality. The acting is at its cheesiest, with jokes and anecdotes thrown out profusely throughout the picture. Most viewers will also take issue with Sybok's character - you'll find out why about halfway through the picture - and the overall plot, which comes off as messy and directionless. The film is not without charm, however. I personally always enjoyed the comedic antics of the three main characters, especially during the opening mountain climbing scenes and during their madcap pursuits in the Enterprise's interior. Action is frequent and will be pleasing for non-discerning Trek fans. As ambitious as the story is, it runs through a rather formulaic plot, with little room for quality character development. Themes should be present, but generally aren't. It's as straightforward and simple as a Trek movie can be. This film is captured with okay, never great, photography and editing. Acting and writing in this picture is never a serious affair; the script gets the job done, but after so many revisions, it has undoubtedly lost something along the way. The cast members do the best they can with their material. Similarly, the sets, props, costumes, and special effects do their best to make the picture work, but are not without weaknesses. Music might be the biggest standout here. The fifth Star Trek film never struck me as being a terrible film, for I have found it enjoyable. However, it is a haphazardly-constructed film with issues that most viewers will find distasteful. Trek fans might want to check this out once, but for everybody else, not recommended. 3.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Average | Film: Average)

    Despite how so many people think that this movie is flawed, I still like this movie because it talks about our place in the universe and with its Yosemite scenes teaches us to respect the environment. I enjoyed this movie and how they went to a God Planet near the center of our galaxy in the direction of Sagittarius the Archer. This movie had an astrophysics consultant on the location of the "God Planet" and they chose the center of our galaxy. I like how this movie commented on religion and how flawed it can be and the "God" villain had one voice and many faces which makes sense. I also love the "Cosmic Thoughts" scene near the end of the movie. This movie is a paradigm to the glory of Star Trek about searching outside in the universe and inside our minds.

    All of you Star Trek fans out there can argue that the first Star Trek was a lackluster start to a successful franchise, but that's not the case here. While the previous three were were very good and vast improvements over the first film, this entry is easily lackluster. Not exactly terrible, but just an example of a film that caused a successful franchise to go downhill like most other films in Hollywood history. There are some good stuff, however, before I can get to the flaws. The cast from the previous films did their best for what they were given from an otherwise terrible script.

Rumour has it that the poor performance of this film nearly killed the franchise. Thankfully it did continue but in the order of things, this could be deleted out of the series and no one would mind.

    What the hell? How could a film like these be made after the others without there being sign of collapsing but there wasn't. Some things were fun and enjoyable, but most was weird and dumb to watch. This film was one I forgot most of but I guess should as there is not much to remember, but there was a part of me that could tell it was bad but was satisfied a little anyway. The camping was fun, the Morse code for move was fun too but not the main bad guy. They were lazy with that. Shatner could have done worse, but could have been better with just Nimoy as the man for the job instead. Don't see it. It adds nothing and takes some from the series.

    When hearing news such as 'Star Trek V' being the worst of the bunch- even worse than the first, I cannot help but have the lowest expectations for a film like this. A plot that is called ridiculous, characters that are called uninteresting and a film that is regarded as the most unnecessary addition to this franchise makes for clearly low expectations. I absolutely hate the first Star Trek movie. It was paced horrendously, the characters were extremely one dimensional and the story was not immersive. It truly was one of the worst franchise openers and I wasn't looking forward to the next ones. Gladly, the trilogy that followed was fantastic! Critics such as legend Roger Ebert have stated this is the worst of the bunch so I went in with the most horrible expectations and surprisingly, this movie shocked me in a good way! I honestly don't get the complaints given to this film. Sure, it isn't a great film but it had a story that was decent, some good characters and added a bit of depth to a few of the characters and provided a few emotional scenes. Sure, the ending to this film was unsatisfying and sure the story was ridiculous but I find this to be a guilty pleasure. The movie truly suffers with some ridiculous scenes at times such as singing 'Row, row, row your boat' and a glimpse at a romance between Scotty and Uhura but for the most part, the story was rather well done and it had a few good moments. The film's pacing is good and I thought that William Shatner did a good job at directing this film considering how much stress it could've been to play a main character and be the director. I know Mel Gibson did it with Braveheart! Despite being a guilty pleasure, I can understand how people say that this film truly was an unnecessary sequel. It doesn't offer much new content apart from a scene where we discover a bit about Bones' past. That scene was well done and provided some emotional depth to his character. People say that this film isn't funny. They say the comedic level of this film is extremely low compared with the previous trilogy. I agree but the comedy still works in this film unlike in the original film. The acting was mostly good and the new characters did a good job, especially the character of Sybok, whom I particularly liked. Star Trek V: The Final Frontier is one of those movies I'd take as a guilty pleasure and an unnecessary addition to the Star Trek franchise yet certainly an enjoyable and fun film. This film truly has gotten better as time passed by. Back in 1989, it was viewed ridiculous and I am a little understanding of that, but by 2013, that so called horrid mess this film was has been forgotten with some fantastic sequels to this so called atrocity.

    After a good, successful run of four films, William Shatner himself steps in to direct the fifth Star Trek feature film. With the title of The Final Frontier, and with the premise of a God-seeking adventure, you'd think this would be the most epic and profound Trek movie of the lot. Sadly, as of the time of this writing, it's considered the worst Trek movie of the series, and for some viewers, it might even be ranked as one of the worst movies of all time. Even I won't deny that the film has its issues. The special effects are strangely gaudy in this film, lacking in refinement or quality. The acting is at its cheesiest, with jokes and anecdotes thrown out profusely throughout the picture. Most viewers will also take issue with Sybok's character - you'll find out why about halfway through the picture - and the overall plot, which comes off as messy and directionless. The film is not without charm, however. I personally always enjoyed the comedic antics of the three main characters, especially during the opening mountain climbing scenes and during their madcap pursuits in the Enterprise's interior. Action is frequent and will be pleasing for non-discerning Trek fans. As ambitious as the story is, it runs through a rather formulaic plot, with little room for quality character development. Themes should be present, but generally aren't. It's as straightforward and simple as a Trek movie can be. This film is captured with okay, never great, photography and editing. Acting and writing in this picture is never a serious affair; the script gets the job done, but after so many revisions, it has undoubtedly lost something along the way. The cast members do the best they can with their material. Similarly, the sets, props, costumes, and special effects do their best to make the picture work, but are not without weaknesses. Music might be the biggest standout here. The fifth Star Trek film never struck me as being a terrible film, for I have found it enjoyable. However, it is a haphazardly-constructed film with issues that most viewers will find distasteful. Trek fans might want to check this out once, but for everybody else, not recommended. 3.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Average | Film: Average)

    Despite how so many people think that this movie is flawed, I still like this movie because it talks about our place in the universe and with its Yosemite scenes teaches us to respect the environment. I enjoyed this movie and how they went to a God Planet near the center of our galaxy in the direction of Sagittarius the Archer. This movie had an astrophysics consultant on the location of the "God Planet" and they chose the center of our galaxy. I like how this movie commented on religion and how flawed it can be and the "God" villain had one voice and many faces which makes sense. I also love the "Cosmic Thoughts" scene near the end of the movie. This movie is a paradigm to the glory of Star Trek about searching outside in the universe and inside our minds.

    All of you Star Trek fans out there can argue that the first Star Trek was a lackluster start to a successful franchise, but that's not the case here. While the previous three were were very good and vast improvements over the first film, this entry is easily lackluster. Not exactly terrible, but just an example of a film that caused a successful franchise to go downhill like most other films in Hollywood history. There are some good stuff, however, before I can get to the flaws. The cast from the previous films did their best for what they were given from an otherwise terrible script. The music score is decent; the visuals and scenery are nice to look at and the special effects are pretty good. Now to the negatives. The script, like I said before, is terrible and the story is contrived with several plot holes that go absolutely nowhere, the dialog is cringe-worthy, the pacing is very sluggish, and the direction is a bit choppy. Overall, not terrible nor good, but a lackluster entry to the series.

    Star Trek 5: The Final Frontier is a decent movie,it isn't awful but it is the worst Star Trek movie,and it shows that directing really isn't William Shatner's thing,he obviously decided since Leonard Nimoy directed the previous two Star Trek movies,but he didn't do nearly as good as Nimoy.The movies story seemed very promising,but it ended being very little story and a lot of not very entertaining action sequences.The only thing that really made this movie enjoyable was,like usual for Star Trek,the cast is brilliant,and I also was surprised with how much I enjoyed the ending.I don't think that the Final Frontier is awful but it's without a doubt the worst Star Trek and fans of the franchise will be very disappointing. Captain Kirk must take on Spock's half brother Sybock,who seizes the Enterprise to travel to space's final frontier to find the Almighty.

    Star Trek V: The Final Frontier ** (out of 4) 107 mins/ PG Cast: William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan, Walter Koeing, Nichelle Nichols, George Takei, David Warner, Laurence Luckinbill Director: William Shatner Plot: The enterprise is hijacked by Spock's half-brother, who wants to use it to reach the holy land of God. JJ's Verdict: Star Trek V: The Final Frontier is undoubtedly the worst of the Original Cast's films. It starts off with a strange opening in a desert, in which a Vulcan manages to get some peculiar looking planet inhabitant, to join him by hugging the fellow. This is not well explained at all and leaves you confused as the Vulcan's situation moves towards civilisation. Jump to a forest where, (ironically) DeForest Kelley is looking at William Shatner climbing a mountain for no valid reason, Leonard Nimoy ascending the mountain on booster shoes for no valid reason and Shatner then falling down the mountain for no valid reason and then being caught by Nimoy who manages to save his friend without even touching him. It is awful logic like this, which just makes it, pure and simply, a bad film. The effects still look poor and homemade and there are some bad slapstick humour and some horribly cheesy one-liners and jokes. The villain, an okay Laurence Luckinbill, can brainwash anyone to join his pilgrimage to God, which begs the question; if you can brainwash anyone then why not use it to get rich or achieve world domination? No, he'd just rather travel forever to find somewhere no one has ever found before, so he can talk to God. The character isn't even comparable to Ricardo Montablon and Christopher Lloyd who have played previous Trek villains extremely well. And it turns out in the end, that he isn't even bad! The crew themselves, really show off their age in some of the action scenes and it is quite worrying to see how much weight some of them have put on. The film isn't all-bad though. The lighter approach in places makes way for some good buddy humour between the three leads and the cinematography is very good. In one part of the film, we get to see the whole of the Enterprise's interior  which is pretty cool  and James Doohan puts in a perfectly timed comic performance. As director, I don't think Shatner did a bad job, just not a good job either! The storyline is poor and although watchable this is just too cringing, and they were very lucky that The Final Frontier wasn't so and the crew returned in 1991.

    I remember going to the cinema to see this first time around, and was thoroughly 'meh' about it in all honesty. I didn't hate it, I didn't love it, and certainly after following The Voyage Home, Final Frontier felt like a massive step backwards. The whole God notion didn't really interest me much then, it seemed such a silly premise, that later we discover in the movie its not God at all is beside the point, many people were turned off from seeing the movie in the first place, because whilst many people believe in God, they probably never actually want to see God, and certainly not a silly sci- fi movies interpretation of God either. Sybok as the main villain...... turns out he's not really a villain at all, but I felt the whole 'Sybok is Spocks brother' storyline was a bit too much soap opera for me. There was never any allusion to Spock having a brother, and for it to be brought up after all this time, just felt too tacked on. Other characters were shortchanged and had virtually no character development, especially the three that were trapped on Nimbus, held captive by Sybok. The one saving grace for the entire movie though, was the camaraderie of the three main characters. I didn't really appreciate it first time around, but more so now, I found myself laughing and smiling, the interaction of Kirk, Spock and Bones at various parts really helped lift the movie, and its one of the few things that helped prevent the movie being drab and boring. The VFX are long held up as being not the best, but to be honest, with the exception of the horrible matte lines around the Enterprise when it was in front of the blue clouds of Shakaree, for the most part, I didn't really notice any problems. Certainly there are elements of Wrath of Khan with similar scenes that don't hold up so well and that was ILM in charge of effects. Final Frontier isn't a bad film, its simply an OK one, and thats really not good enough for Star Trek, and thankfully this wasn't the last movie the original crew did as this would not have been a fitting send off for them. I think they backed themselves in a corner by approaching the 'God' question which simply put a lot of people off, but there is still enough recognisable Trek in it that its not a disaster. Its such a shame that having found big success with The Voyage Home, Paramount slashed the budget on this one, because by all accounts, the original ending was supposed to be far more satisfactory.

    The majority of Trekkies will tell you that "The Final Frontier" is the worst Star Trek movie. Some of the Next Generation movies were bad, but none quite so incompetently put together as this one. The tone is inconsistent, the special effects are shoddy, the plot is weak, the climax is anticlimactic. But for all that, it captures the adventurous spirit of the original show better than any of the other films in the series. A few things stood out to me the last time I watched it. First, the red toy-soldier uniforms look more out-of-place than ever; I kept expecting to see the classic costumes, which would have been more appropriate than the movies' military duds. Second, Captain Kirk sports blue jeans and a flannel shirt in the campfire scenes, as if they took place in the 20th century instead of the 23rd. Finally, the Klingon antagonists seem to have arrived from a different movie only to cause trouble. Where "The Final Frontier" absolutely nails the source material is in its combination of humor, action, metaphysics, and warm characterization. It probably has the best moments between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy of any of the films -- especially since the previous three movies rarely got these iconic character together. Sybok's quest for god may be a little too heavy, but at least it has ambitions. Sybok turns out to be one of the more memorable Star Trek villains: a deluded cult leader on a monomaniacal mission to discover the Garden of Eden, who ultimately realizes where he went wrong and redeems himself in the final reel. None of Trek's other cinematic enemies can boast that sort of dramatic arc. It sounds funny, but I think it might be one of the best Star Trek movies after all.

    As with most of my reviews at the moment i have seen this film a few times before, though i have tried to avoid it. It had always been the worst Trek film in my book. However, having watched it for the first time in ten years today, it is actually tolerable and possibly pushes 'The Motion Picture', alongside some of the TNG films, as the worst. The basic premise if the film is that Spock's half brother Sybok, seeks to find God. I guess as another reviewer has stated, maybe in 100 years this film will be looked upon as a classic but, my word, present day makes it a poor film. The comedy of IV: The Voyage Home was subtle and funny but in this it seems forced. I have to say though, there are a couple of laugh out loud moments mainly coming form McCoy. On the other side of the coin McCoy gives one of the most emotional performances of the film during the moments when he regrets the death of his Father. Apart from that there is a lack of caring for the crew. Something seems to be missing, it really is hard to put your finger on it. There is a lack, dare i say it, nearly no confrontational moments of the film. It is more of a thinking film, like The Motion Picture, really. Thank the lord the re was some aggression and cliffhanging moments in the next film The Undiscovered COuntry. Scotty, Uhuru and Zulu are totally underused. In fact you could have had the film without them and it wouldn't have made much difference. A note however to Scotty's "I know this ship like the back of my hand" line. Kirk, doesn't really feel like the Kirk we love, maybe this is down to him having to concentrate on directing. Having said all that, it is watchable. It has no baring on the rest of the films however. You could easily miss this one out if out wanted. Considerng this featured the maiden voyage of the Enterprise A, it is sadly not even really touched upon, and there is no great fanfare moment that sticks in the memory like the TMP Enterprise refit reveal. There are some cringe-worthy moments, like a hint of romance between Uhuru and Scotty and the evil laughter of Sybok at the start of the film. You grow to like Sybok in the film as his character never really is/becomes a baddie and his redemption at the end of the film is touching. Anything that takes away from the moments when you are watching the so called God, helps! Great to here the TMP Jerry Goldsmith theme once again but the overall soundtrack doesn't stand out at all. To be honest, you will be glad when the film is over. Leave it a decade then watch it again and it is a nice trip down memory lane! Rumour has it that the poor performance of this film nearly killed the franchise. Thankfully it did continue but in the order of things, this could be deleted out of the series and no one would mind.

The effects still look poor and homemade and there are some bad slapstick humour and some horribly cheesy one-liners and jokes. The villain, an okay Laurence Luckinbill, can brainwash anyone to join his pilgrimage to God, which begs the question; if you can brainwash anyone then why not use it to get rich or achieve world domination? No, he'd just rather travel forever to find somewhere no one has ever found before, so he can talk to God. The character isn't even comparable to Ricardo Montablon and Christopher Lloyd who have played previous Trek villains extremely well. And it turns out in the end, that he isn't even bad! The crew themselves, really show off their age in some of the action scenes and it is quite worrying to see how much weight some of them have put on. The film isn't all-bad though. The lighter approach in places makes way for some good buddy humour between the three leads and the cinematography is very good. In one part of the film, we get to see the whole of the Enterprise's interior  which is pretty cool  and James Doohan puts in a perfectly timed comic performance. As director, I don't think Shatner did a bad job, just not a good job either! The storyline is poor and although watchable this is just too cringing, and they were very lucky that The Final Frontier wasn't so and the crew returned in 1991.

    I remember going to the cinema to see this first time around, and was thoroughly 'meh' about it in all honesty. I didn't hate it, I didn't love it, and certainly after following The Voyage Home, Final Frontier felt like a massive step backwards. The whole God notion didn't really interest me much then, it seemed such a silly premise, that later we discover in the movie its not God at all is beside the point, many people were turned off from seeing the movie in the first place, because whilst many people believe in God, they probably never actually want to see God, and certainly not a silly sci- fi movies interpretation of God either. Sybok as the main villain...... turns out he's not really a villain at all, but I felt the whole 'Sybok is Spocks brother' storyline was a bit too much soap opera for me. There was never any allusion to Spock having a brother, and for it to be brought up after all this time, just felt too tacked on. Other characters were shortchanged and had virtually no character development, especially the three that were trapped on Nimbus, held captive by Sybok. The one saving grace for the entire movie though, was the camaraderie of the three main characters. I didn't really appreciate it first time around, but more so now, I found myself laughing and smiling, the interaction of Kirk, Spock and Bones at various parts really helped lift the movie, and its one of the few things that helped prevent the movie being drab and boring. The VFX are long held up as being not the best, but to be honest, with the exception of the horrible matte lines around the Enterprise when it was in front of the blue clouds of Shakaree, for the most part, I didn't really notice any problems. Certainly there are elements of Wrath of Khan with similar scenes that don't hold up so well and that was ILM in charge of effects. Final Frontier isn't a bad film, its simply an OK one, and thats really not good enough for Star Trek, and thankfully this wasn't the last movie the original crew did as this would not have been a fitting send off for them. I think they backed themselves in a corner by approaching the 'God' question which simply put a lot of people off, but there is still enough recognisable Trek in it that its not a disaster. Its such a shame that having found big success with The Voyage Home, Paramount slashed the budget on this one, because by all accounts, the original ending was supposed to be far more satisfactory.

    The majority of Trekkies will tell you that "The Final Frontier" is the worst Star Trek movie. Some of the Next Generation movies were bad, but none quite so incompetently put together as this one. The tone is inconsistent, the special effects are shoddy, the plot is weak, the climax is anticlimactic. But for all that, it captures the adventurous spirit of the original show better than any of the other films in the series. A few things stood out to me the last time I watched it. First, the red toy-soldier uniforms look more out-of-place than ever; I kept expecting to see the classic costumes, which would have been more appropriate than the movies' military duds. Second, Captain Kirk sports blue jeans and a flannel shirt in the campfire scenes, as if they took place in the 20th century instead of the 23rd. Finally, the Klingon antagonists seem to have arrived from a different movie only to cause trouble. Where "The Final Frontier" absolutely nails the source material is in its combination of humor, action, metaphysics, and warm characterization. It probably has the best moments between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy of any of the films -- especially since the previous three movies rarely got these iconic character together. Sybok's quest for god may be a little too heavy, but at least it has ambitions. Sybok turns out to be one of the more memorable Star Trek villains: a deluded cult leader on a monomaniacal mission to discover the Garden of Eden, who ultimately realizes where he went wrong and redeems himself in the final reel. None of Trek's other cinematic enemies can boast that sort of dramatic arc. It sounds funny, but I think it might be one of the best Star Trek movies after all.

    As with most of my reviews at the moment i have seen this film a few times before, though i have tried to avoid it. It had always been the worst Trek film in my book. However, having watched it for the first time in ten years today, it is actually tolerable and possibly pushes 'The Motion Picture', alongside some of the TNG films, as the worst. The basic premise if the film is that Spock's half brother Sybok, seeks to find God. I guess as another reviewer has stated, maybe in 100 years this film will be looked upon as a classic but, my word, present day makes it a poor film. The comedy of IV: The Voyage Home was subtle and funny but in this it seems forced. I have to say though, there are a couple of laugh out loud moments mainly coming form McCoy. On the other side of the coin McCoy gives one of the most emotional performances of the film during the moments when he regrets the death of his Father. Apart from that there is a lack of caring for the crew. Something seems to be missing, it really is hard to put your finger on it. There is a lack, dare i say it, nearly no confrontational moments of the film. It is more of a thinking film, like The Motion Picture, really. Thank the lord the re was some aggression and cliffhanging moments in the next film The Undiscovered COuntry. Scotty, Uhuru and Zulu are totally underused. In fact you could have had the film without them and it wouldn't have made much difference. A note however to Scotty's "I know this ship like the back of my hand" line. Kirk, doesn't really feel like the Kirk we love, maybe this is down to him having to concentrate on directing. Having said all that, it is watchable. It has no baring on the rest of the films however. You could easily miss this one out if out wanted. Considerng this featured the maiden voyage of the Enterprise A, it is sadly not even really touched upon, and there is no great fanfare moment that sticks in the memory like the TMP Enterprise refit reveal. There are some cringe-worthy moments, like a hint of romance between Uhuru and Scotty and the evil laughter of Sybok at the start of the film. You grow to like Sybok in the film as his character never really is/becomes a baddie and his redemption at the end of the film is touching. Anything that takes away from the moments when you are watching the so called God, helps! Great to here the TMP Jerry Goldsmith theme once again but the overall soundtrack doesn't stand out at all. To be honest, you will be glad when the film is over. Leave it a decade then watch it again and it is a nice trip down memory lane! Rumour has it that the poor performance of this film nearly killed the franchise. Thankfully it did continue but in the order of things, this could be deleted out of the series and no one would mind.

    What the hell? How could a film like these be made after the others without there being sign of collapsing but there wasn't. Some things were fun and enjoyable, but most was weird and dumb to watch. This film was one I forgot most of but I guess should as there is not much to remember, but there was a part of me that could tell it was bad but was satisfied a little anyway. The camping was fun, the Morse code for move was fun too but not the main bad guy. They were lazy with that. Shatner could have done worse, but could have been better with just Nimoy as the man for the job instead. Don't see it. It adds nothing and takes some from the series.

    When hearing news such as 'Star Trek V' being the worst of the bunch- even worse than the first, I cannot help but have the lowest expectations for a film like this. A plot that is called ridiculous, characters that are called uninteresting and a film that is regarded as the most unnecessary addition to this franchise makes for clearly low expectations. I absolutely hate the first Star Trek movie. It was paced horrendously, the characters were extremely one dimensional and the story was not immersive. It truly was one of the worst franchise openers and I wasn't looking forward to the next ones. Gladly, the trilogy that followed was fantastic! Critics such as legend Roger Ebert have stated this is the worst of the bunch so I went in with the most horrible expectations and surprisingly, this movie shocked me in a good way! I honestly don't get the complaints given to this film. Sure, it isn't a great film but it had a story that was decent, some good characters and added a bit of depth to a few of the characters and provided a few emotional scenes. Sure, the ending to this film was unsatisfying and sure the story was ridiculous but I find this to be a guilty pleasure. The movie truly suffers with some ridiculous scenes at times such as singing 'Row, row, row your boat' and a glimpse at a romance between Scotty and Uhura but for the most part, the story was rather well done and it had a few good moments. The film's pacing is good and I thought that William Shatner did a good job at directing this film considering how much stress it could've been to play a main character and be the director. I know Mel Gibson did it with Braveheart! Despite being a guilty pleasure, I can understand how people say that this film truly was an unnecessary sequel. It doesn't offer much new content apart from a scene where we discover a bit about Bones' past. That scene was well done and provided some emotional depth to his character. People say that this film isn't funny. They say the comedic level of this film is extremely low compared with the previous trilogy. I agree but the comedy still works in this film unlike in the original film. The acting was mostly good and the new characters did a good job, especially the character of Sybok, whom I particularly liked. Star Trek V: The Final Frontier is one of those movies I'd take as a guilty pleasure and an unnecessary addition to the Star Trek franchise yet certainly an enjoyable and fun film. This film truly has gotten better as time passed by. Back in 1989, it was viewed ridiculous and I am a little understanding of that, but by 2013, that so called horrid mess this film was has been forgotten with some fantastic sequels to this so called atrocity.

    After a good, successful run of four films, William Shatner himself steps in to direct the fifth Star Trek feature film. With the title of The Final Frontier, and with the premise of a God-seeking adventure, you'd think this would be the most epic and profound Trek movie of the lot. Sadly, as of the time of this writing, it's considered the worst Trek movie of the series, and for some viewers, it might even be ranked as one of the worst movies of all time. Even I won't deny that the film has its issues. The special effects are strangely gaudy in this film, lacking in refinement or quality. The acting is at its cheesiest, with jokes and anecdotes thrown out profusely throughout the picture. Most viewers will also take issue with Sybok's character - you'll find out why about halfway through the picture - and the overall plot, which comes off as messy and directionless. The film is not without charm, however. I personally always enjoyed the comedic antics of the three main characters, especially during the opening mountain climbing scenes and during their madcap pursuits in the Enterprise's interior. Action is frequent and will be pleasing for non-discerning Trek fans. As ambitious as the story is, it runs through a rather formulaic plot, with little room for quality character development. Themes should be present, but generally aren't. It's as straightforward and simple as a Trek movie can be. This film is captured with okay, never great, photography and editing. Acting and writing in this picture is never a serious affair; the script gets the job done, but after so many revisions, it has undoubtedly lost something along the way. The cast members do the best they can with their material. Similarly, the sets, props, costumes, and special effects do their best to make the picture work, but are not without weaknesses. Music might be the biggest standout here. The fifth Star Trek film never struck me as being a terrible film, for I have found it enjoyable. However, it is a haphazardly-constructed film with issues that most viewers will find distasteful. Trek fans might want to check this out once, but for everybody else, not recommended. 3.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Average | Film: Average)

    Despite how so many people think that this movie is flawed, I still like this movie because it talks about our place in the universe and with its Yosemite scenes teaches us to respect the environment. I enjoyed this movie and how they went to a God Planet near the center of our galaxy in the direction of Sagittarius the Archer. This movie had an astrophysics consultant on the location of the "God Planet" and they chose the center of our galaxy. I like how this movie commented on religion and how flawed it can be and the "God" villain had one voice and many faces which makes sense. I also love the "Cosmic Thoughts" scene near the end of the movie. This movie is a paradigm to the glory of Star Trek about searching outside in the universe and inside our minds.

    All of you Star Trek fans out there can argue that the first Star Trek was a lackluster start to a successful franchise, but that's not the case here. While the previous three were were very good and vast improvements over the first film, this entry is easily lackluster. Not exactly terrible, but just an example of a film that caused a successful franchise to go downhill like most other films in Hollywood history. There are some good stuff, however, before I can get to the flaws. The cast from the previous films did their best for what they were given from an otherwise terrible script. The music score is decent; the visuals and scenery are nice to look at and the special effects are pretty good. Now to the negatives. The script, like I said before, is terrible and the story is contrived with several plot holes that go absolutely nowhere, the dialog is cringe-worthy, the pacing is very sluggish, and the direction is a bit choppy. Overall, not terrible nor good, but a lackluster entry to the series.

    Star Trek 5: The Final Frontier is a decent movie,it isn't awful but it is the worst Star Trek movie,and it shows that directing really isn't William Shatner's thing,he obviously decided since Leonard Nimoy directed the previous two Star Trek movies,but he didn't do nearly as good as Nimoy.The movies story seemed very promising,but it ended being very little story and a lot of not very entertaining action sequences.The only thing that really made this movie enjoyable was,like usual for Star Trek,the cast is brilliant,and I also was surprised with how much I enjoyed the ending.I don't think that the Final Frontier is awful but it's without a doubt the worst Star Trek and fans of the franchise will be very disappointing. Captain Kirk must take on Spock's half brother Sybock,who seizes the Enterprise to travel to space's final frontier to find the Almighty.

    Star Trek V: The Final Frontier ** (out of 4) 107 mins/ PG Cast: William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan, Walter Koeing, Nichelle Nichols, George Takei, David Warner, Laurence Luckinbill Director: William Shatner Plot: The enterprise is hijacked by Spock's half-brother, who wants to use it to reach the holy land of God. JJ's Verdict: Star Trek V: The Final Frontier is undoubtedly the worst of the Original Cast's films. It starts off with a strange opening in a desert, in which a Vulcan manages to get some peculiar looking planet inhabitant, to join him by hugging the fellow. This is not well explained at all and leaves you confused as the Vulcan's situation moves towards civilisation. Jump to a forest where, (ironically) DeForest Kelley is looking at William Shatner climbing a mountain for no valid reason, Leonard Nimoy ascending the mountain on booster shoes for no valid reason and Shatner then falling down the mountain for no valid reason and then being caught by Nimoy who manages to save his friend without even touching him. It is awful logic like this, which just makes it, pure and simply, a bad film. The effects still look poor and homemade and there are some bad slapstick humour and some horribly cheesy one-liners and jokes. The villain, an okay Laurence Luckinbill, can brainwash anyone to join his pilgrimage to God, which begs the question; if you can brainwash anyone then why not use it to get rich or achieve world domination? No, he'd just rather travel forever to find somewhere no one has ever found before, so he can talk to God. The character isn't even comparable to Ricardo Montablon and Christopher Lloyd who have played previous Trek villains extremely well. And it turns out in the end, that he isn't even bad! The crew themselves, really show off their age in some of the action scenes and it is quite worrying to see how much weight some of them have put on. The film isn't all-bad though. The lighter approach in places makes way for some good buddy humour between the three leads and the cinematography is very good. In one part of the film, we get to see the whole of the Enterprise's interior  which is pretty cool  and James Doohan puts in a perfectly timed comic performance.

The film's pacing is good and I thought that William Shatner did a good job at directing this film considering how much stress it could've been to play a main character and be the director. I know Mel Gibson did it with Braveheart! Despite being a guilty pleasure, I can understand how people say that this film truly was an unnecessary sequel. It doesn't offer much new content apart from a scene where we discover a bit about Bones' past. That scene was well done and provided some emotional depth to his character. People say that this film isn't funny. They say the comedic level of this film is extremely low compared with the previous trilogy. I agree but the comedy still works in this film unlike in the original film. The acting was mostly good and the new characters did a good job, especially the character of Sybok, whom I particularly liked. Star Trek V: The Final Frontier is one of those movies I'd take as a guilty pleasure and an unnecessary addition to the Star Trek franchise yet certainly an enjoyable and fun film. This film truly has gotten better as time passed by. Back in 1989, it was viewed ridiculous and I am a little understanding of that, but by 2013, that so called horrid mess this film was has been forgotten with some fantastic sequels to this so called atrocity.

    After a good, successful run of four films, William Shatner himself steps in to direct the fifth Star Trek feature film. With the title of The Final Frontier, and with the premise of a God-seeking adventure, you'd think this would be the most epic and profound Trek movie of the lot. Sadly, as of the time of this writing, it's considered the worst Trek movie of the series, and for some viewers, it might even be ranked as one of the worst movies of all time. Even I won't deny that the film has its issues. The special effects are strangely gaudy in this film, lacking in refinement or quality. The acting is at its cheesiest, with jokes and anecdotes thrown out profusely throughout the picture. Most viewers will also take issue with Sybok's character - you'll find out why about halfway through the picture - and the overall plot, which comes off as messy and directionless. The film is not without charm, however. I personally always enjoyed the comedic antics of the three main characters, especially during the opening mountain climbing scenes and during their madcap pursuits in the Enterprise's interior. Action is frequent and will be pleasing for non-discerning Trek fans. As ambitious as the story is, it runs through a rather formulaic plot, with little room for quality character development. Themes should be present, but generally aren't. It's as straightforward and simple as a Trek movie can be. This film is captured with okay, never great, photography and editing. Acting and writing in this picture is never a serious affair; the script gets the job done, but after so many revisions, it has undoubtedly lost something along the way. The cast members do the best they can with their material. Similarly, the sets, props, costumes, and special effects do their best to make the picture work, but are not without weaknesses. Music might be the biggest standout here. The fifth Star Trek film never struck me as being a terrible film, for I have found it enjoyable. However, it is a haphazardly-constructed film with issues that most viewers will find distasteful. Trek fans might want to check this out once, but for everybody else, not recommended. 3.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Average | Film: Average)

    Despite how so many people think that this movie is flawed, I still like this movie because it talks about our place in the universe and with its Yosemite scenes teaches us to respect the environment. I enjoyed this movie and how they went to a God Planet near the center of our galaxy in the direction of Sagittarius the Archer. This movie had an astrophysics consultant on the location of the "God Planet" and they chose the center of our galaxy. I like how this movie commented on religion and how flawed it can be and the "God" villain had one voice and many faces which makes sense. I also love the "Cosmic Thoughts" scene near the end of the movie. This movie is a paradigm to the glory of Star Trek about searching outside in the universe and inside our minds.

    All of you Star Trek fans out there can argue that the first Star Trek was a lackluster start to a successful franchise, but that's not the case here. While the previous three were were very good and vast improvements over the first film, this entry is easily lackluster. Not exactly terrible, but just an example of a film that caused a successful franchise to go downhill like most other films in Hollywood history. There are some good stuff, however, before I can get to the flaws. The cast from the previous films did their best for what they were given from an otherwise terrible script. The music score is decent; the visuals and scenery are nice to look at and the special effects are pretty good. Now to the negatives. The script, like I said before, is terrible and the story is contrived with several plot holes that go absolutely nowhere, the dialog is cringe-worthy, the pacing is very sluggish, and the direction is a bit choppy. Overall, not terrible nor good, but a lackluster entry to the series.

    Star Trek 5: The Final Frontier is a decent movie,it isn't awful but it is the worst Star Trek movie,and it shows that directing really isn't William Shatner's thing,he obviously decided since Leonard Nimoy directed the previous two Star Trek movies,but he didn't do nearly as good as Nimoy.The movies story seemed very promising,but it ended being very little story and a lot of not very entertaining action sequences.The only thing that really made this movie enjoyable was,like usual for Star Trek,the cast is brilliant,and I also was surprised with how much I enjoyed the ending.I don't think that the Final Frontier is awful but it's without a doubt the worst Star Trek and fans of the franchise will be very disappointing. Captain Kirk must take on Spock's half brother Sybock,who seizes the Enterprise to travel to space's final frontier to find the Almighty.

    Star Trek V: The Final Frontier ** (out of 4) 107 mins/ PG Cast: William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan, Walter Koeing, Nichelle Nichols, George Takei, David Warner, Laurence Luckinbill Director: William Shatner Plot: The enterprise is hijacked by Spock's half-brother, who wants to use it to reach the holy land of God. JJ's Verdict: Star Trek V: The Final Frontier is undoubtedly the worst of the Original Cast's films. It starts off with a strange opening in a desert, in which a Vulcan manages to get some peculiar looking planet inhabitant, to join him by hugging the fellow. This is not well explained at all and leaves you confused as the Vulcan's situation moves towards civilisation. Jump to a forest where, (ironically) DeForest Kelley is looking at William Shatner climbing a mountain for no valid reason, Leonard Nimoy ascending the mountain on booster shoes for no valid reason and Shatner then falling down the mountain for no valid reason and then being caught by Nimoy who manages to save his friend without even touching him. It is awful logic like this, which just makes it, pure and simply, a bad film. The effects still look poor and homemade and there are some bad slapstick humour and some horribly cheesy one-liners and jokes. The villain, an okay Laurence Luckinbill, can brainwash anyone to join his pilgrimage to God, which begs the question; if you can brainwash anyone then why not use it to get rich or achieve world domination? No, he'd just rather travel forever to find somewhere no one has ever found before, so he can talk to God. The character isn't even comparable to Ricardo Montablon and Christopher Lloyd who have played previous Trek villains extremely well. And it turns out in the end, that he isn't even bad! The crew themselves, really show off their age in some of the action scenes and it is quite worrying to see how much weight some of them have put on. The film isn't all-bad though. The lighter approach in places makes way for some good buddy humour between the three leads and the cinematography is very good. In one part of the film, we get to see the whole of the Enterprise's interior  which is pretty cool  and James Doohan puts in a perfectly timed comic performance. As director, I don't think Shatner did a bad job, just not a good job either! The storyline is poor and although watchable this is just too cringing, and they were very lucky that The Final Frontier wasn't so and the crew returned in 1991.

    I remember going to the cinema to see this first time around, and was thoroughly 'meh' about it in all honesty. I didn't hate it, I didn't love it, and certainly after following The Voyage Home, Final Frontier felt like a massive step backwards. The whole God notion didn't really interest me much then, it seemed such a silly premise, that later we discover in the movie its not God at all is beside the point, many people were turned off from seeing the movie in the first place, because whilst many people believe in God, they probably never actually want to see God, and certainly not a silly sci- fi movies interpretation of God either. Sybok as the main villain...... turns out he's not really a villain at all, but I felt the whole 'Sybok is Spocks brother' storyline was a bit too much soap opera for me. There was never any allusion to Spock having a brother, and for it to be brought up after all this time, just felt too tacked on. Other characters were shortchanged and had virtually no character development, especially the three that were trapped on Nimbus, held captive by Sybok. The one saving grace for the entire movie though, was the camaraderie of the three main characters. I didn't really appreciate it first time around, but more so now, I found myself laughing and smiling, the interaction of Kirk, Spock and Bones at various parts really helped lift the movie, and its one of the few things that helped prevent the movie being drab and boring. The VFX are long held up as being not the best, but to be honest, with the exception of the horrible matte lines around the Enterprise when it was in front of the blue clouds of Shakaree, for the most part, I didn't really notice any problems. Certainly there are elements of Wrath of Khan with similar scenes that don't hold up so well and that was ILM in charge of effects. Final Frontier isn't a bad film, its simply an OK one, and thats really not good enough for Star Trek, and thankfully this wasn't the last movie the original crew did as this would not have been a fitting send off for them. I think they backed themselves in a corner by approaching the 'God' question which simply put a lot of people off, but there is still enough recognisable Trek in it that its not a disaster. Its such a shame that having found big success with The Voyage Home, Paramount slashed the budget on this one, because by all accounts, the original ending was supposed to be far more satisfactory.

    The majority of Trekkies will tell you that "The Final Frontier" is the worst Star Trek movie. Some of the Next Generation movies were bad, but none quite so incompetently put together as this one. The tone is inconsistent, the special effects are shoddy, the plot is weak, the climax is anticlimactic. But for all that, it captures the adventurous spirit of the original show better than any of the other films in the series. A few things stood out to me the last time I watched it. First, the red toy-soldier uniforms look more out-of-place than ever; I kept expecting to see the classic costumes, which would have been more appropriate than the movies' military duds. Second, Captain Kirk sports blue jeans and a flannel shirt in the campfire scenes, as if they took place in the 20th century instead of the 23rd. Finally, the Klingon antagonists seem to have arrived from a different movie only to cause trouble. Where "The Final Frontier" absolutely nails the source material is in its combination of humor, action, metaphysics, and warm characterization. It probably has the best moments between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy of any of the films -- especially since the previous three movies rarely got these iconic character together. Sybok's quest for god may be a little too heavy, but at least it has ambitions. Sybok turns out to be one of the more memorable Star Trek villains: a deluded cult leader on a monomaniacal mission to discover the Garden of Eden, who ultimately realizes where he went wrong and redeems himself in the final reel. None of Trek's other cinematic enemies can boast that sort of dramatic arc. It sounds funny, but I think it might be one of the best Star Trek movies after all.

    As with most of my reviews at the moment i have seen this film a few times before, though i have tried to avoid it. It had always been the worst Trek film in my book. However, having watched it for the first time in ten years today, it is actually tolerable and possibly pushes 'The Motion Picture', alongside some of the TNG films, as the worst. The basic premise if the film is that Spock's half brother Sybok, seeks to find God. I guess as another reviewer has stated, maybe in 100 years this film will be looked upon as a classic but, my word, present day makes it a poor film. The comedy of IV: The Voyage Home was subtle and funny but in this it seems forced. I have to say though, there are a couple of laugh out loud moments mainly coming form McCoy. On the other side of the coin McCoy gives one of the most emotional performances of the film during the moments when he regrets the death of his Father. Apart from that there is a lack of caring for the crew. Something seems to be missing, it really is hard to put your finger on it. There is a lack, dare i say it, nearly no confrontational moments of the film. It is more of a thinking film, like The Motion Picture, really. Thank the lord the re was some aggression and cliffhanging moments in the next film The Undiscovered COuntry. Scotty, Uhuru and Zulu are totally underused. In fact you could have had the film without them and it wouldn't have made much difference. A note however to Scotty's "I know this ship like the back of my hand" line. Kirk, doesn't really feel like the Kirk we love, maybe this is down to him having to concentrate on directing. Having said all that, it is watchable. It has no baring on the rest of the films however. You could easily miss this one out if out wanted. Considerng this featured the maiden voyage of the Enterprise A, it is sadly not even really touched upon, and there is no great fanfare moment that sticks in the memory like the TMP Enterprise refit reveal. There are some cringe-worthy moments, like a hint of romance between Uhuru and Scotty and the evil laughter of Sybok at the start of the film. You grow to like Sybok in the film as his character never really is/becomes a baddie and his redemption at the end of the film is touching. Anything that takes away from the moments when you are watching the so called God, helps! Great to here the TMP Jerry Goldsmith theme once again but the overall soundtrack doesn't stand out at all. To be honest, you will be glad when the film is over. Leave it a decade then watch it again and it is a nice trip down memory lane! Rumour has it that the poor performance of this film nearly killed the franchise. Thankfully it did continue but in the order of things, this could be deleted out of the series and no one would mind.

    What the hell? How could a film like these be made after the others without there being sign of collapsing but there wasn't. Some things were fun and enjoyable, but most was weird and dumb to watch. This film was one I forgot most of but I guess should as there is not much to remember, but there was a part of me that could tell it was bad but was satisfied a little anyway. The camping was fun, the Morse code for move was fun too but not the main bad guy. They were lazy with that. Shatner could have done worse, but could have been better with just Nimoy as the man for the job instead. Don't see it. It adds nothing and takes some from the series.

    When hearing news such as 'Star Trek V' being the worst of the bunch- even worse than the first, I cannot help but have the lowest expectations for a film like this. A plot that is called ridiculous, characters that are called uninteresting and a film that is regarded as the most unnecessary addition to this franchise makes for clearly low expectations. I absolutely hate the first Star Trek movie. It was paced horrendously, the characters were extremely one dimensional and the story was not immersive. It truly was one of the worst franchise openers and I wasn't looking forward to the next ones. Gladly, the trilogy that followed was fantastic! Critics such as legend Roger Ebert have stated this is the worst of the bunch so I went in with the most horrible expectations and surprisingly, this movie shocked me in a good way! I honestly don't get the complaints given to this film. Sure, it isn't a great film but it had a story that was decent, some good characters and added a bit of depth to a few of the characters and provided a few emotional scenes. Sure, the ending to this film was unsatisfying and sure the story was ridiculous but I find this to be a guilty pleasure. The movie truly suffers with some ridiculous scenes at times such as singing 'Row, row, row your boat' and a glimpse at a romance between Scotty and Uhura but for the most part, the story was rather well done and it had a few good moments. The film's pacing is good and I thought that William Shatner did a good job at directing this film considering how much stress it could've been to play a main character and be the director. I know Mel Gibson did it with Braveheart! Despite being a guilty pleasure, I can understand how people say that this film truly was an unnecessary sequel.

I didn't really appreciate it first time around, but more so now, I found myself laughing and smiling, the interaction of Kirk, Spock and Bones at various parts really helped lift the movie, and its one of the few things that helped prevent the movie being drab and boring. The VFX are long held up as being not the best, but to be honest, with the exception of the horrible matte lines around the Enterprise when it was in front of the blue clouds of Shakaree, for the most part, I didn't really notice any problems. Certainly there are elements of Wrath of Khan with similar scenes that don't hold up so well and that was ILM in charge of effects. Final Frontier isn't a bad film, its simply an OK one, and thats really not good enough for Star Trek, and thankfully this wasn't the last movie the original crew did as this would not have been a fitting send off for them. I think they backed themselves in a corner by approaching the 'God' question which simply put a lot of people off, but there is still enough recognisable Trek in it that its not a disaster. Its such a shame that having found big success with The Voyage Home, Paramount slashed the budget on this one, because by all accounts, the original ending was supposed to be far more satisfactory.

    The majority of Trekkies will tell you that "The Final Frontier" is the worst Star Trek movie. Some of the Next Generation movies were bad, but none quite so incompetently put together as this one. The tone is inconsistent, the special effects are shoddy, the plot is weak, the climax is anticlimactic. But for all that, it captures the adventurous spirit of the original show better than any of the other films in the series. A few things stood out to me the last time I watched it. First, the red toy-soldier uniforms look more out-of-place than ever; I kept expecting to see the classic costumes, which would have been more appropriate than the movies' military duds. Second, Captain Kirk sports blue jeans and a flannel shirt in the campfire scenes, as if they took place in the 20th century instead of the 23rd. Finally, the Klingon antagonists seem to have arrived from a different movie only to cause trouble. Where "The Final Frontier" absolutely nails the source material is in its combination of humor, action, metaphysics, and warm characterization. It probably has the best moments between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy of any of the films -- especially since the previous three movies rarely got these iconic character together. Sybok's quest for god may be a little too heavy, but at least it has ambitions. Sybok turns out to be one of the more memorable Star Trek villains: a deluded cult leader on a monomaniacal mission to discover the Garden of Eden, who ultimately realizes where he went wrong and redeems himself in the final reel. None of Trek's other cinematic enemies can boast that sort of dramatic arc. It sounds funny, but I think it might be one of the best Star Trek movies after all.

    As with most of my reviews at the moment i have seen this film a few times before, though i have tried to avoid it. It had always been the worst Trek film in my book. However, having watched it for the first time in ten years today, it is actually tolerable and possibly pushes 'The Motion Picture', alongside some of the TNG films, as the worst. The basic premise if the film is that Spock's half brother Sybok, seeks to find God. I guess as another reviewer has stated, maybe in 100 years this film will be looked upon as a classic but, my word, present day makes it a poor film. The comedy of IV: The Voyage Home was subtle and funny but in this it seems forced. I have to say though, there are a couple of laugh out loud moments mainly coming form McCoy. On the other side of the coin McCoy gives one of the most emotional performances of the film during the moments when he regrets the death of his Father. Apart from that there is a lack of caring for the crew. Something seems to be missing, it really is hard to put your finger on it. There is a lack, dare i say it, nearly no confrontational moments of the film. It is more of a thinking film, like The Motion Picture, really. Thank the lord the re was some aggression and cliffhanging moments in the next film The Undiscovered COuntry. Scotty, Uhuru and Zulu are totally underused. In fact you could have had the film without them and it wouldn't have made much difference. A note however to Scotty's "I know this ship like the back of my hand" line. Kirk, doesn't really feel like the Kirk we love, maybe this is down to him having to concentrate on directing. Having said all that, it is watchable. It has no baring on the rest of the films however. You could easily miss this one out if out wanted. Considerng this featured the maiden voyage of the Enterprise A, it is sadly not even really touched upon, and there is no great fanfare moment that sticks in the memory like the TMP Enterprise refit reveal. There are some cringe-worthy moments, like a hint of romance between Uhuru and Scotty and the evil laughter of Sybok at the start of the film. You grow to like Sybok in the film as his character never really is/becomes a baddie and his redemption at the end of the film is touching. Anything that takes away from the moments when you are watching the so called God, helps! Great to here the TMP Jerry Goldsmith theme once again but the overall soundtrack doesn't stand out at all. To be honest, you will be glad when the film is over. Leave it a decade then watch it again and it is a nice trip down memory lane! Rumour has it that the poor performance of this film nearly killed the franchise. Thankfully it did continue but in the order of things, this could be deleted out of the series and no one would mind.

    What the hell? How could a film like these be made after the others without there being sign of collapsing but there wasn't. Some things were fun and enjoyable, but most was weird and dumb to watch. This film was one I forgot most of but I guess should as there is not much to remember, but there was a part of me that could tell it was bad but was satisfied a little anyway. The camping was fun, the Morse code for move was fun too but not the main bad guy. They were lazy with that. Shatner could have done worse, but could have been better with just Nimoy as the man for the job instead. Don't see it. It adds nothing and takes some from the series.

    When hearing news such as 'Star Trek V' being the worst of the bunch- even worse than the first, I cannot help but have the lowest expectations for a film like this. A plot that is called ridiculous, characters that are called uninteresting and a film that is regarded as the most unnecessary addition to this franchise makes for clearly low expectations. I absolutely hate the first Star Trek movie. It was paced horrendously, the characters were extremely one dimensional and the story was not immersive. It truly was one of the worst franchise openers and I wasn't looking forward to the next ones. Gladly, the trilogy that followed was fantastic! Critics such as legend Roger Ebert have stated this is the worst of the bunch so I went in with the most horrible expectations and surprisingly, this movie shocked me in a good way! I honestly don't get the complaints given to this film. Sure, it isn't a great film but it had a story that was decent, some good characters and added a bit of depth to a few of the characters and provided a few emotional scenes. Sure, the ending to this film was unsatisfying and sure the story was ridiculous but I find this to be a guilty pleasure. The movie truly suffers with some ridiculous scenes at times such as singing 'Row, row, row your boat' and a glimpse at a romance between Scotty and Uhura but for the most part, the story was rather well done and it had a few good moments. The film's pacing is good and I thought that William Shatner did a good job at directing this film considering how much stress it could've been to play a main character and be the director. I know Mel Gibson did it with Braveheart! Despite being a guilty pleasure, I can understand how people say that this film truly was an unnecessary sequel. It doesn't offer much new content apart from a scene where we discover a bit about Bones' past. That scene was well done and provided some emotional depth to his character. People say that this film isn't funny. They say the comedic level of this film is extremely low compared with the previous trilogy. I agree but the comedy still works in this film unlike in the original film. The acting was mostly good and the new characters did a good job, especially the character of Sybok, whom I particularly liked. Star Trek V: The Final Frontier is one of those movies I'd take as a guilty pleasure and an unnecessary addition to the Star Trek franchise yet certainly an enjoyable and fun film. This film truly has gotten better as time passed by. Back in 1989, it was viewed ridiculous and I am a little understanding of that, but by 2013, that so called horrid mess this film was has been forgotten with some fantastic sequels to this so called atrocity.

    After a good, successful run of four films, William Shatner himself steps in to direct the fifth Star Trek feature film. With the title of The Final Frontier, and with the premise of a God-seeking adventure, you'd think this would be the most epic and profound Trek movie of the lot. Sadly, as of the time of this writing, it's considered the worst Trek movie of the series, and for some viewers, it might even be ranked as one of the worst movies of all time. Even I won't deny that the film has its issues. The special effects are strangely gaudy in this film, lacking in refinement or quality. The acting is at its cheesiest, with jokes and anecdotes thrown out profusely throughout the picture. Most viewers will also take issue with Sybok's character - you'll find out why about halfway through the picture - and the overall plot, which comes off as messy and directionless. The film is not without charm, however. I personally always enjoyed the comedic antics of the three main characters, especially during the opening mountain climbing scenes and during their madcap pursuits in the Enterprise's interior. Action is frequent and will be pleasing for non-discerning Trek fans. As ambitious as the story is, it runs through a rather formulaic plot, with little room for quality character development. Themes should be present, but generally aren't. It's as straightforward and simple as a Trek movie can be. This film is captured with okay, never great, photography and editing. Acting and writing in this picture is never a serious affair; the script gets the job done, but after so many revisions, it has undoubtedly lost something along the way. The cast members do the best they can with their material. Similarly, the sets, props, costumes, and special effects do their best to make the picture work, but are not without weaknesses. Music might be the biggest standout here. The fifth Star Trek film never struck me as being a terrible film, for I have found it enjoyable. However, it is a haphazardly-constructed film with issues that most viewers will find distasteful. Trek fans might want to check this out once, but for everybody else, not recommended. 3.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Average | Film: Average)

    Despite how so many people think that this movie is flawed, I still like this movie because it talks about our place in the universe and with its Yosemite scenes teaches us to respect the environment. I enjoyed this movie and how they went to a God Planet near the center of our galaxy in the direction of Sagittarius the Archer. This movie had an astrophysics consultant on the location of the "God Planet" and they chose the center of our galaxy. I like how this movie commented on religion and how flawed it can be and the "God" villain had one voice and many faces which makes sense. I also love the "Cosmic Thoughts" scene near the end of the movie. This movie is a paradigm to the glory of Star Trek about searching outside in the universe and inside our minds.
