    H.G. Wells would punch John Frankenheimer right in the mouth if he could see this Godawful adaptation of his novel. Poorly designed and beyond daft, this terrible film wastes the interesting premise and settles instead for hammy performances, lousy make-up and Val Kilmer. True, there's a speck of entertainment value to be scraped from Marlon Brando and David Thewlis, although their performances both belong in a different film, or possibly a different reality. Those two aside, there's nothing good to say about the movie. Any pretence it has to being thought-provoking or intelligent dissolves within the first five minutes, and before long the whole thing has descended into an overbaked mess of poor CG effects, heavy-handed direction and a near-delirious tone. What should have been a dark horror film about the dangers and moral implications of genetic engineering is instead Â– well, let's not mince words, it's a piece of shite.

    This movie is likely to be the worst movie I've ever watched. It's not only incredibly bad work concerning special effects and make-up but also a lousy performance of all highly decorated actors. I can't believe that Marlon Brando accepted a role in such a project. He was awarded a "Golden Raspberry" for his performance and he deserves it. H.G.Wells novel contains a lot of social critics and critics on sciences and medicine. There's nothing left from Well's intentions in that adaption from 1997. I'd recommend reading the book rather than wasting time with that movie. But after all this movie is bad on such a level that it is already worth being watched!

    In the most eccentric performance of the year, Marlon (Fatso) Brando is painted white to guard against the sun while Val Kilmer as his prot&eacute;g&eacute; just acts weird in this sci-fi chip-shot about a 'mad scientist' who hides on an island where he tries to turn animals into people. A bit too abstract to succeed in the drama department and the animal make-up ain't so hot either - nor are the actors playing those roles. David Thewlis leans on stuff while the rest of the time he staggers his way through the film as an inadvertent visitor to the island. Film is too convoluted to really be effective. Sole good point: beautiful Fairuza Balk portraying Brando's 'daughter' (*meow*).

    Balk smolders. So what? Brando emotes. Interesting. Kilmer embarrasses himself. Perlman growls. Thewlis tries. Worth watching just to see how bad a movie with a great cast and a great director can be. Gratuitous violence, but tame by today's standards. Doesn't help. The 1977 version had Barbara Carrera, so we forgive that. The original (Island of Lost Souls), even in black and white, with a low budget, is far better. This cast makes the ailing, hammy Bela Lugosi look like Oscar material. Brando, for all his talent, doesn't touch Laughton. Frankenheimer makes a couple of points. Men and animals aren't that far apart. The law is determined by the point of a gun. And artistic pretension doesn't make a bad movie better. Of course, that's just my opinion. I could be wrong.

    A confusing composite of make-ups and performances that border on absurd. Both Brando and Kilmer make their characters behave like they are in a comedy sketch while the rest of the cast and assorted monstrosities are caught in a nightmarish Horror Film. There is literally no depth or exploration of the genetics and cloning science or the morality of it all, just scene after scene of half-breeds running around looking as bewildered as the audience. This has got to be the Director's worst film as he strays wildly from his usual gritty political and crime action dramas and finds himself unable to get a handle on the material. The monster makeup ranges from pretty scary too silly and is as inconsistent as the rest of the proceedings. Nothing at all comes together and the result is a laughable and embarrassing take on the profound H.G. Wells story. The still definitive version is Island of Lost Souls (1933).

    Third official version of the H.G. Wells novel was such a troubled production that it's fortunate it would be watchable to any degree. In any event, the story of its making is infinitely more interesting than the final result. For those not familiar with the story, it deals with a plane crash survivor, Edward Douglas (David Thewlis) adrift at sea and picked up by a passing ship, and ending up trapped on a remote island where the local mad scientist, Dr. Moreau (a hilarious Marlon Brando) has been busy turning animals into human like abominations. He's just in time to witness as the beasts start tiring of their treatment and stage a horrific uprising, while Moreau's second in command, Montgomery (an amusing Val Kilmer) goes bat *beep* crazy, and Edward becomes taken with a cat woman named Aissa (sexy Fairuza Balk). This film is indeed quite a mess, and is never terribly involving, but at least it manages to be a somewhat *intriguing* mess. The ideas at work here still make some impact, although it would have helped had there been a stronger protagonist. Thewlis, who has gone on record as saying this was a very negative experience for him, looks largely disinterested, unlike Kilmer and screen legend Brando (Brando looking very pasty faced and rotund here); they both ham it up something fierce. Balk is quite appealing, and there's also the always welcome presence of Ron Perlman, playing the Sayer of the Law. One good thing that can be said is that the creature designs by the Stan Winston Studio *are* indeed impressive, and the actors buried under the makeup all do a creditable job, especially Daniel Rigney and Mark Dacascos as the scary characters Hyena-Swine and Lo-Mai. This movie is beautiful in a visual sense, so it does have the look of quality, with production design by Graham "Grace" Walker and cinematography by William A. Fraker; it was filmed on location in Queensland, Australia. One can't help but wonder what could have been had original director Richard Stanley (the man behind the cult items "Hardware" and "Dust Devil") not been fired. As it is, legendary political thriller master John Frankenheimer ("The Manchurian Candidate", "Seven Days in May"), who was brought in to try to create something releasable, does a slick job, even if his heart wasn't really in it. Fans of the book would be advised to stick with the '32 and '77 adaptations; overall, this film does have good horror movie moments, and ends fairly well, but isn't too memorable when all is said and done. Six out of 10.

    Sitting through "Prophecy" director John Frankenheimer's pretentious horror fantasy "The Island of Dr. Moreau," starring Marlon Brando and Val Kilmer, may be enough to turn anybody into an animal. Presumably, the financial success of recent genetic thrillers such as "Jurassic Park" and "Species" prompted producer Edward R. Pressmen to reanimate H.G. Wells' literary classic for its third rendition. Ironically, this deeply flawed but imaginatively updated version suffers a fate similar to that of the genetic mutants created by the titular villain on his remote island. The movie opens on three plane crash survivors who have been adrift in the Java Sea for days. Two of them are killed by a shark leaving our hero, Edward Douglas (David Thewlis of "Naked"), a United Nations peace negotiator. Douglas awakens to the sight of a sailing vessel hovering over him. He collapses from exhaustion and reawakens to find Montgomery (Val Kilmer of "Tombstone") attending him. Douglas is too weak to do anything more than swoon. Eventually, the ship deposits them at an exotic island where the research center of Dr. Moreau is located. Montgomery persuades Douglas to join him, on the basis that they have a telecommunications system on the island that Douglas can use to contact the UN. As we soon learn, however, Montgomery is lying. The island is actually the home and refuge of Dr. Moreau, a brilliant geneticist who was forced into seclusion due to his controversial experiments on animals. Moreau has learned how to transform common animals into human beings, or almost human beings. Douglas finds himself trapped on the island, surrounded by Moreau's beastly creations. He tries to escape several times to no avail. First, he stumbles in on an ungodly birth scene, then finds himself in a half-man, half-animal zoo at an abandoned military airfield. Finally, Douglas meets Moreau. They argue about which way the scales of morality should tilt and dredge up Biblical passages to support their arguments. Moreau tries to explain how his experiments will help mankind. He reveals that he has discovered that the devil is a collection of genes. Moreau means to sort out those bad genes and produce an ideal human. He is even willing to accept a failure or two along the road to success, which accounts for the vast number of beast-men. Moreau keeps these ugly creatures under his thumb by means of implants which he uses to shock them into paralysis. Meanwhile, Montgomery keeps the creatures dazed and confused with narcotics. The inventive but predictable Richard Stanley & Ron Hutchinson screenplay updates the 1896 Wells novel and does a good job of establishing the action in the 1990s. The opening 40 minutes introduces audiences to everyone and everything they need to know about the plot. Sadly, the script packs no surprises. If you cannot figure out what's going to happen from one moment to the next in the film then you must be on horse tranquilizers. Suffice it to say, "Moreau" doesn't qualify as a date movie, (unless you never want to see your date again). Some of the gruesome looking creatures may even go on to inhabit the island of your dreams. Stan Winston's creature designs are impressive. His mutants look as convincing as mutants could possibly look. Sometimes, they are even nauseating. Typically, they retain the basic shape of the animal from which they were mutated so they have a beastly looking head, hands and feet, while the rest of them is hidden beneath their apparel to conserve on costs. The first grisly glimpse that Douglas gets is a multi-breasted beast mother siring an "E.T." infant. The other animals are a hideous collection of mutants with claw hands and snaggled teeth. They gallery of beast men and women appears twice as grisly, gyrating their horrid bodies as Montgomery peddles narcotics to kill them happy. Marlon Brando treats moviegoers to another of his characteristically peculiar performances. There is nothing ordinary about Brando's brilliant but eccentric Dr. Moreau. Brando stages a dramatic entrance, swathed in white garments under a pagoda-style hat, resembling a Japanese Kabuki actor in sunglasses. He tolerates the steamy island heat and wears chalky make-up to preserve his delicate skin from the sun. Metaphorically, this sun allergy relates somehow to Moreau's moral infamy; he cannot stand up to the light of morality. He appears like the great white hope in the camp of the beast men. Brando adopts the same sissified voice that he used for his Fletcher Christian in the 1962 version of "Mutiny on the Bounty." He also never appears twice in the same wardrobe. One scene finds him garbed like a nocturnal fridge raider while in another scene he appears bundled up like an Arab sultan. Audiences are meant to identify with the David Thewlis' narrator. Incidentally, Thewlis replaced Rob Morrow of CBS-TV's "Northern Exposure." A similar air of mystery clouds Val Kilmer's Montgomery. Montgomery gravitates between moments of extreme clarity and apathetic zombie like drug dazes. Either the script is purposefully vague or (more realistically) the editors sheared Kilmer's performance to reduce the film's running time to 90 minutes so they could squeeze in more showings and parlay a quick profit. Ultimately, Montgomery assumes a Luifer-like character in his apparent rivalry with Moreau. Again, the script doesn't clarify this part of the story. Is Montgomery Moreau's rival? We never know for certain. "The Island of Dr. Moreau" ranks as an ambitious but flawed horror fantasy. Anybody who relishes Frankenheimer's version of "Moreau" can hope that someday New Line Cinema will release a director's cut that restores the lost parts of the film. This well-made but routine concludes with Douglas moralizing about how Moreau's island serves as a microcosm of the world and that we must all go in fear of man's unstable nature. The only thing that audiences can really go in fear of is the sequel that might lie over the horizon.

    Sitting through "Prophecy" director John Frankenheimer's pretentious horror fantasy "The Island of Dr. Moreau," starring Marlon Brando and Val Kilmer, may be enough to turn anybody into an animal. Presumably, the financial success of recent genetic thrillers such as "Jurassic Park" and "Species" prompted producer Edward R. Pressmen to reanimate H.G. Wells' literary classic for its third rendition. Ironically, this deeply flawed but imaginatively updated version suffers a fate similar to that of the genetic mutants created by the titular villain on his remote island. The movie opens on three plane crash survivors who have been adrift in the Java Sea for days. Two of them are killed by a shark leaving our hero, Edward Douglas (David Thewlis of "Naked"), a United Nations peace negotiator. Douglas awakens to the sight of a sailing vessel hovering over him. He collapses from exhaustion and reawakens to find Montgomery (Val Kilmer of "Tombstone") attending him. Douglas is too weak to do anything more than swoon. Eventually, the ship deposits them at an exotic island where the research center of Dr. Moreau is located. Montgomery persuades Douglas to join him, on the basis that they have a telecommunications system on the island that Douglas can use to contact the UN. As we soon learn, however, Montgomery is lying. The island is actually the home and refuge of Dr. Moreau, a brilliant geneticist who was forced into seclusion due to his controversial experiments on animals. Moreau has learned how to transform common animals into human beings, or almost human beings. Douglas finds himself trapped on the island, surrounded by Moreau's beastly creations. He tries to escape several times to no avail. First, he stumbles in on an ungodly birth scene, then finds himself in a half-man, half-animal zoo at an abandoned military airfield. Finally, Douglas meets Moreau. They argue about which way the scales of morality should tilt and dredge up Biblical passages to support their arguments. Moreau tries to explain how his experiments will help mankind. He reveals that he has discovered that the devil is a collection of genes. Moreau means to sort out those bad genes and produce an ideal human. He is even willing to accept a failure or two along the road to success, which accounts for the vast number of beast-men. Moreau keeps these ugly creatures under his thumb by means of implants which he uses to shock them into paralysis. Meanwhile, Montgomery keeps the creatures dazed and confused with narcotics. The inventive but predictable Richard Stanley & Ron Hutchinson screenplay updates the 1896 Wells novel and does a good job of establishing the action in the 1990s. The opening 40 minutes introduces audiences to everyone and everything they need to know about the plot. Sadly, the script packs no surprises. If you cannot figure out what's going to happen from one moment to the next in the film then you must be on horse tranquilizers. Suffice it to say, "Moreau" doesn't qualify as a date movie, (unless you never want to see your date again). Some of the gruesome looking creatures may even go on to inhabit the island of your dreams. Stan Winston's creature designs are impressive. His mutants look as convincing as mutants could possibly look. Sometimes, they are even nauseating. Typically, they retain the basic shape of the animal from which they were mutated so they have a beastly looking head, hands and feet, while the rest of them is hidden beneath their apparel to conserve on costs. The first grisly glimpse that Douglas gets is a multi-breasted beast mother siring an "E.T." infant. The other animals are a hideous collection of mutants with claw hands and snaggled teeth. They gallery of beast men and women appears twice as grisly, gyrating their horrid bodies as Montgomery peddles narcotics to kill them happy. Marlon Brando treats moviegoers to another of his characteristically peculiar performances. There is nothing ordinary about Brando's brilliant but eccentric Dr. Moreau. Brando stages a dramatic entrance, swathed in white garments under a pagoda-style hat, resembling a Japanese Kabuki actor in sunglasses. He tolerates the steamy island heat and wears chalky make-up to preserve his delicate skin from the sun. Metaphorically, this sun allergy relates somehow to Moreau's moral infamy; he cannot stand up to the light of morality. He appears like the great white hope in the camp of the beast men. Brando adopts the same sissified voice that he used for his Fletcher Christian in the 1962 version of "Mutiny on the Bounty." He also never appears twice in the same wardrobe. One scene finds him garbed like a nocturnal fridge raider while in another scene he appears bundled up like an Arab sultan. Audiences are meant to identify with the David Thewlis' narrator. Incidentally, Thewlis replaced Rob Morrow of CBS-TV's "Northern Exposure." A similar air of mystery clouds Val Kilmer's Montgomery. Montgomery gravitates between moments of extreme clarity and apathetic zombie like drug dazes. Either the script is purposefully vague or (more realistically) the editors sheared Kilmer's performance to reduce the film's running time to 90 minutes so they could squeeze in more showings and parlay a quick profit. Ultimately, Montgomery assumes a Luifer-like character in his apparent rivalry with Moreau. Again, the script doesn't clarify this part of the story. Is Montgomery Moreau's rival? We never know for certain. "The Island of Dr. Moreau" ranks as an ambitious but flawed horror fantasy. Anybody who relishes Frankenheimer's version of "Moreau" can hope that someday New Line Cinema will release a director's cut that restores the lost parts of the film. This well-made but routine concludes with Douglas moralizing about how Moreau's island serves as a microcosm of the world and that we must all go in fear of man's unstable nature. The only thing that audiences can really go in fear of is the sequel that might lie over the horizon.

    H.G. Wells would punch John Frankenheimer right in the mouth if he could see this Godawful adaptation of his novel. Poorly designed and beyond daft, this terrible film wastes the interesting premise and settles instead for hammy performances, lousy make-up and Val Kilmer. True, there's a speck of entertainment value to be scraped from Marlon Brando and David Thewlis, although their performances both belong in a different film, or possibly a different reality. Those two aside, there's nothing good to say about the movie. Any pretence it has to being thought-provoking or intelligent dissolves within the first five minutes, and before long the whole thing has descended into an overbaked mess of poor CG effects, heavy-handed direction and a near-delirious tone. What should have been a dark horror film about the dangers and moral implications of genetic engineering is instead Â– well, let's not mince words, it's a piece of shite.

    This movie is likely to be the worst movie I've ever watched. It's not only incredibly bad work concerning special effects and make-up but also a lousy performance of all highly decorated actors. I can't believe that Marlon Brando accepted a role in such a project. He was awarded a "Golden Raspberry" for his performance and he deserves it. H.G.Wells novel contains a lot of social critics and critics on sciences and medicine. There's nothing left from Well's intentions in that adaption from 1997. I'd recommend reading the book rather than wasting time with that movie. But after all this movie is bad on such a level that it is already worth being watched!

    In the most eccentric performance of the year, Marlon (Fatso) Brando is painted white to guard against the sun while Val Kilmer as his prot&eacute;g&eacute; just acts weird in this sci-fi chip-shot about a 'mad scientist' who hides on an island where he tries to turn animals into people. A bit too abstract to succeed in the drama department and the animal make-up ain't so hot either - nor are the actors playing those roles. David Thewlis leans on stuff while the rest of the time he staggers his way through the film as an inadvertent visitor to the island. Film is too convoluted to really be effective. Sole good point: beautiful Fairuza Balk portraying Brando's 'daughter' (*meow*).

    Balk smolders. So what? Brando emotes. Interesting. Kilmer embarrasses himself. Perlman growls. Thewlis tries. Worth watching just to see how bad a movie with a great cast and a great director can be. Gratuitous violence, but tame by today's standards. Doesn't help. The 1977 version had Barbara Carrera, so we forgive that. The original (Island of Lost Souls), even in black and white, with a low budget, is far better. This cast makes the ailing, hammy Bela Lugosi look like Oscar material. Brando, for all his talent, doesn't touch Laughton. Frankenheimer makes a couple of points. Men and animals aren't that far apart. The law is determined by the point of a gun. And artistic pretension doesn't make a bad movie better. Of course, that's just my opinion. I could be wrong.

    A confusing composite of make-ups and performances that border on absurd. Both Brando and Kilmer make their characters behave like they are in a comedy sketch while the rest of the cast and assorted monstrosities are caught in a nightmarish Horror Film. There is literally no depth or exploration of the genetics and cloning science or the morality of it all, just scene after scene of half-breeds running around looking as bewildered as the audience. This has got to be the Director's worst film as he strays wildly from his usual gritty political and crime action dramas and finds himself unable to get a handle on the material. The monster makeup ranges from pretty scary too silly and is as inconsistent as the rest of the proceedings. Nothing at all comes together and the result is a laughable and embarrassing take on the profound H.G. Wells story. The still definitive version is Island of Lost Souls (1933).

    Third official version of the H.G. Wells novel was such a troubled production that it's fortunate it would be watchable to any degree. In any event, the story of its making is infinitely more interesting than the final result. For those not familiar with the story, it deals with a plane crash survivor, Edward Douglas (David Thewlis) adrift at sea and picked up by a passing ship, and ending up trapped on a remote island where the local mad scientist, Dr. Moreau (a hilarious Marlon Brando) has been busy turning animals into human like abominations. He's just in time to witness as the beasts start tiring of their treatment and stage a horrific uprising, while Moreau's second in command, Montgomery (an amusing Val Kilmer) goes bat *beep* crazy, and Edward becomes taken with a cat woman named Aissa (sexy Fairuza Balk). This film is indeed quite a mess, and is never terribly involving, but at least it manages to be a somewhat *intriguing* mess. The ideas at work here still make some impact, although it would have helped had there been a stronger protagonist. Thewlis, who has gone on record as saying this was a very negative experience for him, looks largely disinterested, unlike Kilmer and screen legend Brando (Brando looking very pasty faced and rotund here); they both ham it up something fierce. Balk is quite appealing, and there's also the always welcome presence of Ron Perlman, playing the Sayer of the Law. One good thing that can be said is that the creature designs by the Stan Winston Studio *are* indeed impressive, and the actors buried under the makeup all do a creditable job, especially Daniel Rigney and Mark Dacascos as the scary characters Hyena-Swine and Lo-Mai. This movie is beautiful in a visual sense, so it does have the look of quality, with production design by Graham "Grace" Walker and cinematography by William A. Fraker; it was filmed on location in Queensland, Australia. One can't help but wonder what could have been had original director Richard Stanley (the man behind the cult items "Hardware" and "Dust Devil") not been fired. As it is, legendary political thriller master John Frankenheimer ("The Manchurian Candidate", "Seven Days in May"), who was brought in to try to create something releasable, does a slick job, even if his heart wasn't really in it. Fans of the book would be advised to stick with the '32 and '77 adaptations; overall, this film does have good horror movie moments, and ends fairly well, but isn't too memorable when all is said and done. Six out of 10.

    and loses a death-match with dignity. Seriously, I can't think of any other explanation. It seems like they went out of their way to make him look silly, from the giant Mumu to the ice bucket on the top of his head. This was the third major attempt to bring H.G. Wells story to the big screen, and it really isn't an improvement over the other two. It fails in that Moreau's actions really make no sense. He seems to be mutilating these animals for the pure hell of it. They also shoe-in a love story between the protagonist and the panther girl, something all three movies did but H.G. Wells never would have done. Val Kilmner plays his associate, Montgeomery, and he at least has the virtue of being nuts from the drugs.

Ironically, this deeply flawed but imaginatively updated version suffers a fate similar to that of the genetic mutants created by the titular villain on his remote island. The movie opens on three plane crash survivors who have been adrift in the Java Sea for days. Two of them are killed by a shark leaving our hero, Edward Douglas (David Thewlis of "Naked"), a United Nations peace negotiator. Douglas awakens to the sight of a sailing vessel hovering over him. He collapses from exhaustion and reawakens to find Montgomery (Val Kilmer of "Tombstone") attending him. Douglas is too weak to do anything more than swoon. Eventually, the ship deposits them at an exotic island where the research center of Dr. Moreau is located. Montgomery persuades Douglas to join him, on the basis that they have a telecommunications system on the island that Douglas can use to contact the UN. As we soon learn, however, Montgomery is lying. The island is actually the home and refuge of Dr. Moreau, a brilliant geneticist who was forced into seclusion due to his controversial experiments on animals. Moreau has learned how to transform common animals into human beings, or almost human beings. Douglas finds himself trapped on the island, surrounded by Moreau's beastly creations. He tries to escape several times to no avail. First, he stumbles in on an ungodly birth scene, then finds himself in a half-man, half-animal zoo at an abandoned military airfield.

Moreau tries to explain how his experiments will help mankind. He reveals that he has discovered that the devil is a collection of genes. Moreau means to sort out those bad genes and produce an ideal human. He is even willing to accept a failure or two along the road to success, which accounts for the vast number of beast-men.

His mutants look as convincing as mutants could possibly look. Sometimes, they are even nauseating. Typically, they retain the basic shape of the animal from which they were mutated so they have a beastly looking head, hands and feet, while the rest of them is hidden beneath their apparel to conserve on costs. The first grisly glimpse that Douglas gets is a multi-breasted beast mother siring an "E.T." infant. The other animals are a hideous collection of mutants with claw hands and snaggled teeth. They gallery of beast men and women appears twice as grisly, gyrating their horrid bodies as Montgomery peddles narcotics to kill them happy. Marlon Brando treats moviegoers to another of his characteristically peculiar performances. There is nothing ordinary about Brando's brilliant but eccentric Dr. Moreau. Brando stages a dramatic entrance, swathed in white garments under a pagoda-style hat, resembling a Japanese Kabuki actor in sunglasses. He tolerates the steamy island heat and wears chalky make-up to preserve his delicate skin from the sun. Metaphorically, this sun allergy relates somehow to Moreau's moral infamy; he cannot stand up to the light of morality. He appears like the great white hope in the camp of the beast men. Brando adopts the same sissified voice that he used for his Fletcher Christian in the 1962 version of "Mutiny on the Bounty." He also never appears twice in the same wardrobe. One scene finds him garbed like a nocturnal fridge raider while in another scene he appears bundled up like an Arab sultan. Audiences are meant to identify with the David Thewlis' narrator. Incidentally, Thewlis replaced Rob Morrow of CBS-TV's "Northern Exposure." A similar air of mystery clouds Val Kilmer's Montgomery.

He's just in time to witness as the beasts start tiring of their treatment and stage a horrific uprising, while Moreau's second in command, Montgomery (an amusing Val Kilmer) goes bat *beep* crazy, and Edward becomes taken with a cat woman named Aissa (sexy Fairuza Balk). This film is indeed quite a mess, and is never terribly involving, but at least it manages to be a somewhat *intriguing* mess. The ideas at work here still make some impact, although it would have helped had there been a stronger protagonist. Thewlis, who has gone on record as saying this was a very negative experience for him, looks largely disinterested, unlike Kilmer and screen legend Brando (Brando looking very pasty faced and rotund here); they both ham it up something fierce. Balk is quite appealing, and there's also the always welcome presence of Ron Perlman, playing the Sayer of the Law. One good thing that can be said is that the creature designs by the Stan Winston Studio *are* indeed impressive, and the actors buried under the makeup all do a creditable job, especially Daniel Rigney and Mark Dacascos as the scary characters Hyena-Swine and Lo-Mai. This movie is beautiful in a visual sense, so it does have the look of quality, with production design by Graham "Grace" Walker and cinematography by William A. Fraker; it was filmed on location in Queensland, Australia. One can't help but wonder what could have been had original director Richard Stanley (the man behind the cult items "Hardware" and "Dust Devil") not been fired. As it is, legendary political thriller master John Frankenheimer ("The Manchurian Candidate", "Seven Days in May"), who was brought in to try to create something releasable, does a slick job, even if his heart wasn't really in it. Fans of the book would be advised to stick with the '32 and '77 adaptations; overall, this film does have good horror movie moments, and ends fairly well, but isn't too memorable when all is said and done. Six out of 10.

He seems to be mutilating these animals for the pure hell of it. They also shoe-in a love story between the protagonist and the panther girl, something all three movies did but H.G.

    Sitting through "Prophecy" director John Frankenheimer's pretentious horror fantasy "The Island of Dr. Moreau," starring Marlon Brando and Val Kilmer, may be enough to turn anybody into an animal. Presumably, the financial success of recent genetic thrillers such as "Jurassic Park" and "Species" prompted producer Edward R. Pressmen to reanimate H.G. Wells' literary classic for its third rendition. Ironically, this deeply flawed but imaginatively updated version suffers a fate similar to that of the genetic mutants created by the titular villain on his remote island. The movie opens on three plane crash survivors who have been adrift in the Java Sea for days. Two of them are killed by a shark leaving our hero, Edward Douglas (David Thewlis of "Naked"), a United Nations peace negotiator. Douglas awakens to the sight of a sailing vessel hovering over him. He collapses from exhaustion and reawakens to find Montgomery (Val Kilmer of "Tombstone") attending him. Douglas is too weak to do anything more than swoon. Eventually, the ship deposits them at an exotic island where the research center of Dr. Moreau is located. Montgomery persuades Douglas to join him, on the basis that they have a telecommunications system on the island that Douglas can use to contact the UN. As we soon learn, however, Montgomery is lying. The island is actually the home and refuge of Dr. Moreau, a brilliant geneticist who was forced into seclusion due to his controversial experiments on animals. Moreau has learned how to transform common animals into human beings, or almost human beings. Douglas finds himself trapped on the island, surrounded by Moreau's beastly creations. He tries to escape several times to no avail. First, he stumbles in on an ungodly birth scene, then finds himself in a half-man, half-animal zoo at an abandoned military airfield. Finally, Douglas meets Moreau. They argue about which way the scales of morality should tilt and dredge up Biblical passages to support their arguments. Moreau tries to explain how his experiments will help mankind. He reveals that he has discovered that the devil is a collection of genes. Moreau means to sort out those bad genes and produce an ideal human. He is even willing to accept a failure or two along the road to success, which accounts for the vast number of beast-men. Moreau keeps these ugly creatures under his thumb by means of implants which he uses to shock them into paralysis. Meanwhile, Montgomery keeps the creatures dazed and confused with narcotics. The inventive but predictable Richard Stanley & Ron Hutchinson screenplay updates the 1896 Wells novel and does a good job of establishing the action in the 1990s. The opening 40 minutes introduces audiences to everyone and everything they need to know about the plot. Sadly, the script packs no surprises. If you cannot figure out what's going to happen from one moment to the next in the film then you must be on horse tranquilizers. Suffice it to say, "Moreau" doesn't qualify as a date movie, (unless you never want to see your date again). Some of the gruesome looking creatures may even go on to inhabit the island of your dreams. Stan Winston's creature designs are impressive. His mutants look as convincing as mutants could possibly look. Sometimes, they are even nauseating. Typically, they retain the basic shape of the animal from which they were mutated so they have a beastly looking head, hands and feet, while the rest of them is hidden beneath their apparel to conserve on costs. The first grisly glimpse that Douglas gets is a multi-breasted beast mother siring an "E.T." infant. The other animals are a hideous collection of mutants with claw hands and snaggled teeth. They gallery of beast men and women appears twice as grisly, gyrating their horrid bodies as Montgomery peddles narcotics to kill them happy. Marlon Brando treats moviegoers to another of his characteristically peculiar performances. There is nothing ordinary about Brando's brilliant but eccentric Dr. Moreau. Brando stages a dramatic entrance, swathed in white garments under a pagoda-style hat, resembling a Japanese Kabuki actor in sunglasses. He tolerates the steamy island heat and wears chalky make-up to preserve his delicate skin from the sun. Metaphorically, this sun allergy relates somehow to Moreau's moral infamy; he cannot stand up to the light of morality. He appears like the great white hope in the camp of the beast men. Brando adopts the same sissified voice that he used for his Fletcher Christian in the 1962 version of "Mutiny on the Bounty." He also never appears twice in the same wardrobe. One scene finds him garbed like a nocturnal fridge raider while in another scene he appears bundled up like an Arab sultan. Audiences are meant to identify with the David Thewlis' narrator. Incidentally, Thewlis replaced Rob Morrow of CBS-TV's "Northern Exposure." A similar air of mystery clouds Val Kilmer's Montgomery. Montgomery gravitates between moments of extreme clarity and apathetic zombie like drug dazes. Either the script is purposefully vague or (more realistically) the editors sheared Kilmer's performance to reduce the film's running time to 90 minutes so they could squeeze in more showings and parlay a quick profit. Ultimately, Montgomery assumes a Luifer-like character in his apparent rivalry with Moreau. Again, the script doesn't clarify this part of the story. Is Montgomery Moreau's rival? We never know for certain. "The Island of Dr. Moreau" ranks as an ambitious but flawed horror fantasy. Anybody who relishes Frankenheimer's version of "Moreau" can hope that someday New Line Cinema will release a director's cut that restores the lost parts of the film. This well-made but routine concludes with Douglas moralizing about how Moreau's island serves as a microcosm of the world and that we must all go in fear of man's unstable nature. The only thing that audiences can really go in fear of is the sequel that might lie over the horizon.

    H.G. Wells would punch John Frankenheimer right in the mouth if he could see this Godawful adaptation of his novel. Poorly designed and beyond daft, this terrible film wastes the interesting premise and settles instead for hammy performances, lousy make-up and Val Kilmer. True, there's a speck of entertainment value to be scraped from Marlon Brando and David Thewlis, although their performances both belong in a different film, or possibly a different reality. Those two aside, there's nothing good to say about the movie.

    This movie is likely to be the worst movie I've ever watched. It's not only incredibly bad work concerning special effects and make-up but also a lousy performance of all highly decorated actors. I can't believe that Marlon Brando accepted a role in such a project. He was awarded a "Golden Raspberry" for his performance and he deserves it. H.G.Wells novel contains a lot of social critics and critics on sciences and medicine. There's nothing left from Well's intentions in that adaption from 1997. I'd recommend reading the book rather than wasting time with that movie. But after all this movie is bad on such a level that it is already worth being watched!

    In the most eccentric performance of the year, Marlon (Fatso) Brando is painted white to guard against the sun while Val Kilmer as his prot&eacute;g&eacute; just acts weird in this sci-fi chip-shot about a 'mad scientist' who hides on an island where he tries to turn animals into people. A bit too abstract to succeed in the drama department and the animal make-up ain't so hot either - nor are the actors playing those roles. David Thewlis leans on stuff while the rest of the time he staggers his way through the film as an inadvertent visitor to the island. Film is too convoluted to really be effective. Sole good point: beautiful Fairuza Balk portraying Brando's 'daughter' (*meow*).

    Balk smolders. So what? Brando emotes. Interesting. Kilmer embarrasses himself. Perlman growls. Thewlis tries. Worth watching just to see how bad a movie with a great cast and a great director can be. Gratuitous violence, but tame by today's standards. Doesn't help. The 1977 version had Barbara Carrera, so we forgive that. The original (Island of Lost Souls), even in black and white, with a low budget, is far better. This cast makes the ailing, hammy Bela Lugosi look like Oscar material. Brando, for all his talent, doesn't touch Laughton. Frankenheimer makes a couple of points. Men and animals aren't that far apart. The law is determined by the point of a gun. And artistic pretension doesn't make a bad movie better. Of course, that's just my opinion. I could be wrong.

    Essentially the " Directors Cut " or should say is the unrated cut ,scenes , such as the beginning of the beast peoples take over which is more blood thirty , the killing , of Dr Moreau , teeth biting into his flesh , also there is one " Hyena Swine " chews the doctors ( father, the) arm off with inter-cuts of various animal people's blood soaked teeth. I personally believe , how a few minutes of graphic shoots shown, in sequence , can make the difference . The reason for my mid rating is , the blu ray release , did not not have the any bonus features , no commentary track , extended documentaries or a retrospect of people who work on the film , I do not know if the DVD release , has the features I mentioned , I perused , one release online and there were no indication of any features . Though the picture are excellent on the Blu ray and likewise with the audio , I hope this will be of help , to interested parties of this much maligned film .... Thank you , for the opportunity ..

    A confusing composite of make-ups and performances that border on absurd. Both Brando and Kilmer make their characters behave like they are in a comedy sketch while the rest of the cast and assorted monstrosities are caught in a nightmarish Horror Film. There is literally no depth or exploration of the genetics and cloning science or the morality of it all, just scene after scene of half-breeds running around looking as bewildered as the audience. This has got to be the Director's worst film as he strays wildly from his usual gritty political and crime action dramas and finds himself unable to get a handle on the material. The monster makeup ranges from pretty scary too silly and is as inconsistent as the rest of the proceedings. Nothing at all comes together and the result is a laughable and embarrassing take on the profound H.G. Wells story. The still definitive version is Island of Lost Souls (1933).

    I remember watching the movie trailer on TV when I was a kid in high school. The movie was sorta interesting especially it got Val Kilmer and Marlon Brando. Now that I've been able to watch it thanks to Comcast's on-demand, well I certainly didn't miss much. The movie pretty much was so and so. So many of the actors' talent was wasted by the director and I heard there was some clashes with the director and the cast. The art of the movie could use some improvement as well as the music and camera direction. Anyways, nothing was spent on watching this film but probably not really a film you wanna watch on Saturday night. I certainly want my 1 hour and 36 minutes back.

    Third official version of the H.G. Wells novel was such a troubled production that it's fortunate it would be watchable to any degree. In any event, the story of its making is infinitely more interesting than the final result. For those not familiar with the story, it deals with a plane crash survivor, Edward Douglas (David Thewlis) adrift at sea and picked up by a passing ship, and ending up trapped on a remote island where the local mad scientist, Dr. Moreau (a hilarious Marlon Brando) has been busy turning animals into human like abominations. He's just in time to witness as the beasts start tiring of their treatment and stage a horrific uprising, while Moreau's second in command, Montgomery (an amusing Val Kilmer) goes bat *beep* crazy, and Edward becomes taken with a cat woman named Aissa (sexy Fairuza Balk). This film is indeed quite a mess, and is never terribly involving, but at least it manages to be a somewhat *intriguing* mess. The ideas at work here still make some impact, although it would have helped had there been a stronger protagonist. Thewlis, who has gone on record as saying this was a very negative experience for him, looks largely disinterested, unlike Kilmer and screen legend Brando (Brando looking very pasty faced and rotund here); they both ham it up something fierce. Balk is quite appealing, and there's also the always welcome presence of Ron Perlman, playing the Sayer of the Law. One good thing that can be said is that the creature designs by the Stan Winston Studio *are* indeed impressive, and the actors buried under the makeup all do a creditable job, especially Daniel Rigney and Mark Dacascos as the scary characters Hyena-Swine and Lo-Mai. This movie is beautiful in a visual sense, so it does have the look of quality, with production design by Graham "Grace" Walker and cinematography by William A. Fraker; it was filmed on location in Queensland, Australia. One can't help but wonder what could have been had original director Richard Stanley (the man behind the cult items "Hardware" and "Dust Devil") not been fired. As it is, legendary political thriller master John Frankenheimer ("The Manchurian Candidate", "Seven Days in May"), who was brought in to try to create something releasable, does a slick job, even if his heart wasn't really in it. Fans of the book would be advised to stick with the '32 and '77 adaptations; overall, this film does have good horror movie moments, and ends fairly well, but isn't too memorable when all is said and done. Six out of 10.

    A confusing composite of make-ups and performances that border on absurd. Both Brando and Kilmer make their characters behave like they are in a comedy sketch while the rest of the cast and assorted monstrosities are caught in a nightmarish Horror Film. There is literally no depth or exploration of the genetics and cloning science or the morality of it all, just scene after scene of half-breeds running around looking as bewildered as the audience. This has got to be the Director's worst film as he strays wildly from his usual gritty political and crime action dramas and finds himself unable to get a handle on the material. The monster makeup ranges from pretty scary too silly and is as inconsistent as the rest of the proceedings. Nothing at all comes together and the result is a laughable and embarrassing take on the profound H.G. Wells story. The still definitive version is Island of Lost Souls (1933).

    I remember watching the movie trailer on TV when I was a kid in high school. The movie was sorta interesting especially it got Val Kilmer and Marlon Brando. Now that I've been able to watch it thanks to Comcast's on-demand, well I certainly didn't miss much. The movie pretty much was so and so. So many of the actors' talent was wasted by the director and I heard there was some clashes with the director and the cast. The art of the movie could use some improvement as well as the music and camera direction. Anyways, nothing was spent on watching this film but probably not really a film you wanna watch on Saturday night. I certainly want my 1 hour and 36 minutes back.

    Third official version of the H.G. Wells novel was such a troubled production that it's fortunate it would be watchable to any degree. In any event, the story of its making is infinitely more interesting than the final result. For those not familiar with the story, it deals with a plane crash survivor, Edward Douglas (David Thewlis) adrift at sea and picked up by a passing ship, and ending up trapped on a remote island where the local mad scientist, Dr. Moreau (a hilarious Marlon Brando) has been busy turning animals into human like abominations. He's just in time to witness as the beasts start tiring of their treatment and stage a horrific uprising, while Moreau's second in command, Montgomery (an amusing Val Kilmer) goes bat *beep* crazy, and Edward becomes taken with a cat woman named Aissa (sexy Fairuza Balk). This film is indeed quite a mess, and is never terribly involving, but at least it manages to be a somewhat *intriguing* mess. The ideas at work here still make some impact, although it would have helped had there been a stronger protagonist. Thewlis, who has gone on record as saying this was a very negative experience for him, looks largely disinterested, unlike Kilmer and screen legend Brando (Brando looking very pasty faced and rotund here); they both ham it up something fierce. Balk is quite appealing, and there's also the always welcome presence of Ron Perlman, playing the Sayer of the Law. One good thing that can be said is that the creature designs by the Stan Winston Studio *are* indeed impressive, and the actors buried under the makeup all do a creditable job, especially Daniel Rigney and Mark Dacascos as the scary characters Hyena-Swine and Lo-Mai. This movie is beautiful in a visual sense, so it does have the look of quality, with production design by Graham "Grace" Walker and cinematography by William A. Fraker; it was filmed on location in Queensland, Australia. One can't help but wonder what could have been had original director Richard Stanley (the man behind the cult items "Hardware" and "Dust Devil") not been fired. As it is, legendary political thriller master John Frankenheimer ("The Manchurian Candidate", "Seven Days in May"), who was brought in to try to create something releasable, does a slick job, even if his heart wasn't really in it. Fans of the book would be advised to stick with the '32 and '77 adaptations; overall, this film does have good horror movie moments, and ends fairly well, but isn't too memorable when all is said and done. Six out of 10.

    Sitting through "Prophecy" director John Frankenheimer's pretentious horror fantasy "The Island of Dr. Moreau," starring Marlon Brando and Val Kilmer, may be enough to turn anybody into an animal. Presumably, the financial success of recent genetic thrillers such as "Jurassic Park" and "Species" prompted producer Edward R. Pressmen to reanimate H.G. Wells' literary classic for its third rendition. Ironically, this deeply flawed but imaginatively updated version suffers a fate similar to that of the genetic mutants created by the titular villain on his remote island. The movie opens on three plane crash survivors who have been adrift in the Java Sea for days. Two of them are killed by a shark leaving our hero, Edward Douglas (David Thewlis of "Naked"), a United Nations peace negotiator. Douglas awakens to the sight of a sailing vessel hovering over him. He collapses from exhaustion and reawakens to find Montgomery (Val Kilmer of "Tombstone") attending him. Douglas is too weak to do anything more than swoon. Eventually, the ship deposits them at an exotic island where the research center of Dr. Moreau is located. Montgomery persuades Douglas to join him, on the basis that they have a telecommunications system on the island that Douglas can use to contact the UN. As we soon learn, however, Montgomery is lying. The island is actually the home and refuge of Dr. Moreau, a brilliant geneticist who was forced into seclusion due to his controversial experiments on animals. Moreau has learned how to transform common animals into human beings, or almost human beings. Douglas finds himself trapped on the island, surrounded by Moreau's beastly creations. He tries to escape several times to no avail. First, he stumbles in on an ungodly birth scene, then finds himself in a half-man, half-animal zoo at an abandoned military airfield. Finally, Douglas meets Moreau. They argue about which way the scales of morality should tilt and dredge up Biblical passages to support their arguments. Moreau tries to explain how his experiments will help mankind. He reveals that he has discovered that the devil is a collection of genes. Moreau means to sort out those bad genes and produce an ideal human. He is even willing to accept a failure or two along the road to success, which accounts for the vast number of beast-men. Moreau keeps these ugly creatures under his thumb by means of implants which he uses to shock them into paralysis. Meanwhile, Montgomery keeps the creatures dazed and confused with narcotics. The inventive but predictable Richard Stanley & Ron Hutchinson screenplay updates the 1896 Wells novel and does a good job of establishing the action in the 1990s. The opening 40 minutes introduces audiences to everyone and everything they need to know about the plot. Sadly, the script packs no surprises. If you cannot figure out what's going to happen from one moment to the next in the film then you must be on horse tranquilizers. Suffice it to say, "Moreau" doesn't qualify as a date movie, (unless you never want to see your date again). Some of the gruesome looking creatures may even go on to inhabit the island of your dreams. Stan Winston's creature designs are impressive. His mutants look as convincing as mutants could possibly look. Sometimes, they are even nauseating. Typically, they retain the basic shape of the animal from which they were mutated so they have a beastly looking head, hands and feet, while the rest of them is hidden beneath their apparel to conserve on costs. The first grisly glimpse that Douglas gets is a multi-breasted beast mother siring an "E.T." infant. The other animals are a hideous collection of mutants with claw hands and snaggled teeth. They gallery of beast men and women appears twice as grisly, gyrating their horrid bodies as Montgomery peddles narcotics to kill them happy. Marlon Brando treats moviegoers to another of his characteristically peculiar performances. There is nothing ordinary about Brando's brilliant but eccentric Dr. Moreau. Brando stages a dramatic entrance, swathed in white garments under a pagoda-style hat, resembling a Japanese Kabuki actor in sunglasses. He tolerates the steamy island heat and wears chalky make-up to preserve his delicate skin from the sun. Metaphorically, this sun allergy relates somehow to Moreau's moral infamy; he cannot stand up to the light of morality. He appears like the great white hope in the camp of the beast men. Brando adopts the same sissified voice that he used for his Fletcher Christian in the 1962 version of "Mutiny on the Bounty." He also never appears twice in the same wardrobe. One scene finds him garbed like a nocturnal fridge raider while in another scene he appears bundled up like an Arab sultan. Audiences are meant to identify with the David Thewlis' narrator. Incidentally, Thewlis replaced Rob Morrow of CBS-TV's "Northern Exposure." A similar air of mystery clouds Val Kilmer's Montgomery. Montgomery gravitates between moments of extreme clarity and apathetic zombie like drug dazes. Either the script is purposefully vague or (more realistically) the editors sheared Kilmer's performance to reduce the film's running time to 90 minutes so they could squeeze in more showings and parlay a quick profit. Ultimately, Montgomery assumes a Luifer-like character in his apparent rivalry with Moreau. Again, the script doesn't clarify this part of the story. Is Montgomery Moreau's rival? We never know for certain. "The Island of Dr. Moreau" ranks as an ambitious but flawed horror fantasy. Anybody who relishes Frankenheimer's version of "Moreau" can hope that someday New Line Cinema will release a director's cut that restores the lost parts of the film. This well-made but routine concludes with Douglas moralizing about how Moreau's island serves as a microcosm of the world and that we must all go in fear of man's unstable nature. The only thing that audiences can really go in fear of is the sequel that might lie over the horizon.

    H.G. Wells would punch John Frankenheimer right in the mouth if he could see this Godawful adaptation of his novel. Poorly designed and beyond daft, this terrible film wastes the interesting premise and settles instead for hammy performances, lousy make-up and Val Kilmer. True, there's a speck of entertainment value to be scraped from Marlon Brando and David Thewlis, although their performances both belong in a different film, or possibly a different reality. Those two aside, there's nothing good to say about the movie. Any pretence it has to being thought-provoking or intelligent dissolves within the first five minutes, and before long the whole thing has descended into an overbaked mess of poor CG effects, heavy-handed direction and a near-delirious tone. What should have been a dark horror film about the dangers and moral implications of genetic engineering is instead Â– well, let's not mince words, it's a piece of shite.

    This movie is likely to be the worst movie I've ever watched. It's not only incredibly bad work concerning special effects and make-up but also a lousy performance of all highly decorated actors. I can't believe that Marlon Brando accepted a role in such a project. He was awarded a "Golden Raspberry" for his performance and he deserves it. H.G.Wells novel contains a lot of social critics and critics on sciences and medicine. There's nothing left from Well's intentions in that adaption from 1997. I'd recommend reading the book rather than wasting time with that movie. But after all this movie is bad on such a level that it is already worth being watched!

    In the most eccentric performance of the year, Marlon (Fatso) Brando is painted white to guard against the sun while Val Kilmer as his prot&eacute;g&eacute; just acts weird in this sci-fi chip-shot about a 'mad scientist' who hides on an island where he tries to turn animals into people. A bit too abstract to succeed in the drama department and the animal make-up ain't so hot either - nor are the actors playing those roles. David Thewlis leans on stuff while the rest of the time he staggers his way through the film as an inadvertent visitor to the island. Film is too convoluted to really be effective. Sole good point: beautiful Fairuza Balk portraying Brando's 'daughter' (*meow*).

    Balk smolders. So what? Brando emotes. Interesting. Kilmer embarrasses himself. Perlman growls. Thewlis tries. Worth watching just to see how bad a movie with a great cast and a great director can be. Gratuitous violence, but tame by today's standards. Doesn't help. The 1977 version had Barbara Carrera, so we forgive that. The original (Island of Lost Souls), even in black and white, with a low budget, is far better. This cast makes the ailing, hammy Bela Lugosi look like Oscar material. Brando, for all his talent, doesn't touch Laughton. Frankenheimer makes a couple of points. Men and animals aren't that far apart. The law is determined by the point of a gun. And artistic pretension doesn't make a bad movie better. Of course, that's just my opinion. I could be wrong.

    A confusing composite of make-ups and performances that border on absurd. Both Brando and Kilmer make their characters behave like they are in a comedy sketch while the rest of the cast and assorted monstrosities are caught in a nightmarish Horror Film. There is literally no depth or exploration of the genetics and cloning science or the morality of it all, just scene after scene of half-breeds running around looking as bewildered as the audience. This has got to be the Director's worst film as he strays wildly from his usual gritty political and crime action dramas and finds himself unable to get a handle on the material. The monster makeup ranges from pretty scary too silly and is as inconsistent as the rest of the proceedings. Nothing at all comes together and the result is a laughable and embarrassing take on the profound H.G. Wells story. The still definitive version is Island of Lost Souls (1933).

I can't believe that Marlon Brando accepted a role in such a project. He was awarded a "Golden Raspberry" for his performance and he deserves it. H.G.Wells novel contains a lot of social critics and critics on sciences and medicine. There's nothing left from Well's intentions in that adaption from 1997. I'd recommend reading the book rather than wasting time with that movie. But after all this movie is bad on such a level that it is already worth being watched!

    In the most eccentric performance of the year, Marlon (Fatso) Brando is painted white to guard against the sun while Val Kilmer as his prot&eacute;g&eacute; just acts weird in this sci-fi chip-shot about a 'mad scientist' who hides on an island where he tries to turn animals into people. A bit too abstract to succeed in the drama department and the animal make-up ain't so hot either - nor are the actors playing those roles. David Thewlis leans on stuff while the rest of the time he staggers his way through the film as an inadvertent visitor to the island. Film is too convoluted to really be effective. Sole good point: beautiful Fairuza Balk portraying Brando's 'daughter' (*meow*).

    Balk smolders. So what? Brando emotes. Interesting. Kilmer embarrasses himself. Perlman growls. Thewlis tries. Worth watching just to see how bad a movie with a great cast and a great director can be. Gratuitous violence, but tame by today's standards. Doesn't help. The 1977 version had Barbara Carrera, so we forgive that. The original (Island of Lost Souls), even in black and white, with a low budget, is far better. This cast makes the ailing, hammy Bela Lugosi look like Oscar material. Brando, for all his talent, doesn't touch Laughton. Frankenheimer makes a couple of points. Men and animals aren't that far apart. The law is determined by the point of a gun. And artistic pretension doesn't make a bad movie better. Of course, that's just my opinion. I could be wrong.

    A confusing composite of make-ups and performances that border on absurd. Both Brando and Kilmer make their characters behave like they are in a comedy sketch while the rest of the cast and assorted monstrosities are caught in a nightmarish Horror Film. There is literally no depth or exploration of the genetics and cloning science or the morality of it all, just scene after scene of half-breeds running around looking as bewildered as the audience. This has got to be the Director's worst film as he strays wildly from his usual gritty political and crime action dramas and finds himself unable to get a handle on the material. The monster makeup ranges from pretty scary too silly and is as inconsistent as the rest of the proceedings. Nothing at all comes together and the result is a laughable and embarrassing take on the profound H.G. Wells story. The still definitive version is Island of Lost Souls (1933).

    I remember watching the movie trailer on TV when I was a kid in high school. The movie was sorta interesting especially it got Val Kilmer and Marlon Brando. Now that I've been able to watch it thanks to Comcast's on-demand, well I certainly didn't miss much. The movie pretty much was so and so. So many of the actors' talent was wasted by the director and I heard there was some clashes with the director and the cast. The art of the movie could use some improvement as well as the music and camera direction. Anyways, nothing was spent on watching this film but probably not really a film you wanna watch on Saturday night. I certainly want my 1 hour and 36 minutes back.

    Third official version of the H.G. Wells novel was such a troubled production that it's fortunate it would be watchable to any degree. In any event, the story of its making is infinitely more interesting than the final result. For those not familiar with the story, it deals with a plane crash survivor, Edward Douglas (David Thewlis) adrift at sea and picked up by a passing ship, and ending up trapped on a remote island where the local mad scientist, Dr. Moreau (a hilarious Marlon Brando) has been busy turning animals into human like abominations. He's just in time to witness as the beasts start tiring of their treatment and stage a horrific uprising, while Moreau's second in command, Montgomery (an amusing Val Kilmer) goes bat *beep* crazy, and Edward becomes taken with a cat woman named Aissa (sexy Fairuza Balk). This film is indeed quite a mess, and is never terribly involving, but at least it manages to be a somewhat *intriguing* mess. The ideas at work here still make some impact, although it would have helped had there been a stronger protagonist. Thewlis, who has gone on record as saying this was a very negative experience for him, looks largely disinterested, unlike Kilmer and screen legend Brando (Brando looking very pasty faced and rotund here); they both ham it up something fierce. Balk is quite appealing, and there's also the always welcome presence of Ron Perlman, playing the Sayer of the Law. One good thing that can be said is that the creature designs by the Stan Winston Studio *are* indeed impressive, and the actors buried under the makeup all do a creditable job, especially Daniel Rigney and Mark Dacascos as the scary characters Hyena-Swine and Lo-Mai. This movie is beautiful in a visual sense, so it does have the look of quality, with production design by Graham "Grace" Walker and cinematography by William A. Fraker; it was filmed on location in Queensland, Australia. One can't help but wonder what could have been had original director Richard Stanley (the man behind the cult items "Hardware" and "Dust Devil") not been fired. As it is, legendary political thriller master John Frankenheimer ("The Manchurian Candidate", "Seven Days in May"), who was brought in to try to create something releasable, does a slick job, even if his heart wasn't really in it. Fans of the book would be advised to stick with the '32 and '77 adaptations; overall, this film does have good horror movie moments, and ends fairly well, but isn't too memorable when all is said and done. Six out of 10.

    Sitting through "Prophecy" director John Frankenheimer's pretentious horror fantasy "The Island of Dr. Moreau," starring Marlon Brando and Val Kilmer, may be enough to turn anybody into an animal. Presumably, the financial success of recent genetic thrillers such as "Jurassic Park" and "Species" prompted producer Edward R. Pressmen to reanimate H.G. Wells' literary classic for its third rendition. Ironically, this deeply flawed but imaginatively updated version suffers a fate similar to that of the genetic mutants created by the titular villain on his remote island. The movie opens on three plane crash survivors who have been adrift in the Java Sea for days. Two of them are killed by a shark leaving our hero, Edward Douglas (David Thewlis of "Naked"), a United Nations peace negotiator. Douglas awakens to the sight of a sailing vessel hovering over him. He collapses from exhaustion and reawakens to find Montgomery (Val Kilmer of "Tombstone") attending him. Douglas is too weak to do anything more than swoon. Eventually, the ship deposits them at an exotic island where the research center of Dr. Moreau is located. Montgomery persuades Douglas to join him, on the basis that they have a telecommunications system on the island that Douglas can use to contact the UN. As we soon learn, however, Montgomery is lying. The island is actually the home and refuge of Dr. Moreau, a brilliant geneticist who was forced into seclusion due to his controversial experiments on animals. Moreau has learned how to transform common animals into human beings, or almost human beings. Douglas finds himself trapped on the island, surrounded by Moreau's beastly creations. He tries to escape several times to no avail. First, he stumbles in on an ungodly birth scene, then finds himself in a half-man, half-animal zoo at an abandoned military airfield. Finally, Douglas meets Moreau. They argue about which way the scales of morality should tilt and dredge up Biblical passages to support their arguments. Moreau tries to explain how his experiments will help mankind. He reveals that he has discovered that the devil is a collection of genes. Moreau means to sort out those bad genes and produce an ideal human. He is even willing to accept a failure or two along the road to success, which accounts for the vast number of beast-men. Moreau keeps these ugly creatures under his thumb by means of implants which he uses to shock them into paralysis. Meanwhile, Montgomery keeps the creatures dazed and confused with narcotics. The inventive but predictable Richard Stanley & Ron Hutchinson screenplay updates the 1896 Wells novel and does a good job of establishing the action in the 1990s. The opening 40 minutes introduces audiences to everyone and everything they need to know about the plot. Sadly, the script packs no surprises. If you cannot figure out what's going to happen from one moment to the next in the film then you must be on horse tranquilizers. Suffice it to say, "Moreau" doesn't qualify as a date movie, (unless you never want to see your date again). Some of the gruesome looking creatures may even go on to inhabit the island of your dreams. Stan Winston's creature designs are impressive. His mutants look as convincing as mutants could possibly look. Sometimes, they are even nauseating. Typically, they retain the basic shape of the animal from which they were mutated so they have a beastly looking head, hands and feet, while the rest of them is hidden beneath their apparel to conserve on costs. The first grisly glimpse that Douglas gets is a multi-breasted beast mother siring an "E.T." infant. The other animals are a hideous collection of mutants with claw hands and snaggled teeth. They gallery of beast men and women appears twice as grisly, gyrating their horrid bodies as Montgomery peddles narcotics to kill them happy. Marlon Brando treats moviegoers to another of his characteristically peculiar performances. There is nothing ordinary about Brando's brilliant but eccentric Dr. Moreau. Brando stages a dramatic entrance, swathed in white garments under a pagoda-style hat, resembling a Japanese Kabuki actor in sunglasses. He tolerates the steamy island heat and wears chalky make-up to preserve his delicate skin from the sun. Metaphorically, this sun allergy relates somehow to Moreau's moral infamy; he cannot stand up to the light of morality. He appears like the great white hope in the camp of the beast men. Brando adopts the same sissified voice that he used for his Fletcher Christian in the 1962 version of "Mutiny on the Bounty." He also never appears twice in the same wardrobe. One scene finds him garbed like a nocturnal fridge raider while in another scene he appears bundled up like an Arab sultan. Audiences are meant to identify with the David Thewlis' narrator. Incidentally, Thewlis replaced Rob Morrow of CBS-TV's "Northern Exposure." A similar air of mystery clouds Val Kilmer's Montgomery. Montgomery gravitates between moments of extreme clarity and apathetic zombie like drug dazes. Either the script is purposefully vague or (more realistically) the editors sheared Kilmer's performance to reduce the film's running time to 90 minutes so they could squeeze in more showings and parlay a quick profit. Ultimately, Montgomery assumes a Luifer-like character in his apparent rivalry with Moreau. Again, the script doesn't clarify this part of the story. Is Montgomery Moreau's rival? We never know for certain. "The Island of Dr. Moreau" ranks as an ambitious but flawed horror fantasy. Anybody who relishes Frankenheimer's version of "Moreau" can hope that someday New Line Cinema will release a director's cut that restores the lost parts of the film. This well-made but routine concludes with Douglas moralizing about how Moreau's island serves as a microcosm of the world and that we must all go in fear of man's unstable nature. The only thing that audiences can really go in fear of is the sequel that might lie over the horizon.

    H.G. Wells would punch John Frankenheimer right in the mouth if he could see this Godawful adaptation of his novel. Poorly designed and beyond daft, this terrible film wastes the interesting premise and settles instead for hammy performances, lousy make-up and Val Kilmer. True, there's a speck of entertainment value to be scraped from Marlon Brando and David Thewlis, although their performances both belong in a different film, or possibly a different reality. Those two aside, there's nothing good to say about the movie. Any pretence it has to being thought-provoking or intelligent dissolves within the first five minutes, and before long the whole thing has descended into an overbaked mess of poor CG effects, heavy-handed direction and a near-delirious tone. What should have been a dark horror film about the dangers and moral implications of genetic engineering is instead Â– well, let's not mince words, it's a piece of shite.

    This movie is likely to be the worst movie I've ever watched. It's not only incredibly bad work concerning special effects and make-up but also a lousy performance of all highly decorated actors. I can't believe that Marlon Brando accepted a role in such a project. He was awarded a "Golden Raspberry" for his performance and he deserves it. H.G.Wells novel contains a lot of social critics and critics on sciences and medicine. There's nothing left from Well's intentions in that adaption from 1997. I'd recommend reading the book rather than wasting time with that movie. But after all this movie is bad on such a level that it is already worth being watched!

Worth watching just to see how bad a movie with a great cast and a great director can be. Gratuitous violence, but tame by today's standards. Doesn't help. The 1977 version had Barbara Carrera, so we forgive that. The original (Island of Lost Souls), even in black and white, with a low budget, is far better. This cast makes the ailing, hammy Bela Lugosi look like Oscar material. Brando, for all his talent, doesn't touch Laughton. Frankenheimer makes a couple of points. Men and animals aren't that far apart. The law is determined by the point of a gun. And artistic pretension doesn't make a bad movie better. Of course, that's just my opinion. I could be wrong.

Metaphorically, this sun allergy relates somehow to Moreau's moral infamy; he cannot stand up to the light of morality. He appears like the great white hope in the camp of the beast men.

We never know for certain. "The Island of Dr. Moreau" ranks as an ambitious but flawed horror fantasy. Anybody who relishes Frankenheimer's version of "Moreau" can hope that someday New Line Cinema will release a director's cut that restores the lost parts of the film. This well-made but routine concludes with Douglas moralizing about how Moreau's island serves as a microcosm of the world and that we must all go in fear of man's unstable nature. The only thing that audiences can really go in fear of is the sequel that might lie over the horizon.

    H.G. Wells would punch John Frankenheimer right in the mouth if he could see this Godawful adaptation of his novel. Poorly designed and beyond daft, this terrible film wastes the interesting premise and settles instead for hammy performances, lousy make-up and Val Kilmer. True, there's a speck of entertainment value to be scraped from Marlon Brando and David Thewlis, although their performances both belong in a different film, or possibly a different reality. Those two aside, there's nothing good to say about the movie. Any pretence it has to being thought-provoking or intelligent dissolves within the first five minutes, and before long the whole thing has descended into an overbaked mess of poor CG effects, heavy-handed direction and a near-delirious tone. What should have been a dark horror film about the dangers and moral implications of genetic engineering is instead Â– well, let's not mince words, it's a piece of shite.

    This movie is likely to be the worst movie I've ever watched. It's not only incredibly bad work concerning special effects and make-up but also a lousy performance of all highly decorated actors. I can't believe that Marlon Brando accepted a role in such a project. He was awarded a "Golden Raspberry" for his performance and he deserves it. H.G.Wells novel contains a lot of social critics and critics on sciences and medicine. There's nothing left from Well's intentions in that adaption from 1997. I'd recommend reading the book rather than wasting time with that movie. But after all this movie is bad on such a level that it is already worth being watched!

    In the most eccentric performance of the year, Marlon (Fatso) Brando is painted white to guard against the sun while Val Kilmer as his prot&eacute;g&eacute; just acts weird in this sci-fi chip-shot about a 'mad scientist' who hides on an island where he tries to turn animals into people. A bit too abstract to succeed in the drama department and the animal make-up ain't so hot either - nor are the actors playing those roles. David Thewlis leans on stuff while the rest of the time he staggers his way through the film as an inadvertent visitor to the island. Film is too convoluted to really be effective. Sole good point: beautiful Fairuza Balk portraying Brando's 'daughter' (*meow*).

    Balk smolders. So what? Brando emotes. Interesting. Kilmer embarrasses himself. Perlman growls. Thewlis tries. Worth watching just to see how bad a movie with a great cast and a great director can be. Gratuitous violence, but tame by today's standards. Doesn't help. The 1977 version had Barbara Carrera, so we forgive that. The original (Island of Lost Souls), even in black and white, with a low budget, is far better. This cast makes the ailing, hammy Bela Lugosi look like Oscar material. Brando, for all his talent, doesn't touch Laughton. Frankenheimer makes a couple of points. Men and animals aren't that far apart. The law is determined by the point of a gun. And artistic pretension doesn't make a bad movie better. Of course, that's just my opinion. I could be wrong.

    Essentially the " Directors Cut " or should say is the unrated cut ,scenes , such as the beginning of the beast peoples take over which is more blood thirty , the killing , of Dr Moreau , teeth biting into his flesh , also there is one " Hyena Swine " chews the doctors ( father, the) arm off with inter-cuts of various animal people's blood soaked teeth. I personally believe , how a few minutes of graphic shoots shown, in sequence , can make the difference . The reason for my mid rating is , the blu ray release , did not not have the any bonus features , no commentary track , extended documentaries or a retrospect of people who work on the film , I do not know if the DVD release , has the features I mentioned , I perused , one release online and there were no indication of any features . Though the picture are excellent on the Blu ray and likewise with the audio , I hope this will be of help , to interested parties of this much maligned film .... Thank you , for the opportunity ..

    A confusing composite of make-ups and performances that border on absurd. Both Brando and Kilmer make their characters behave like they are in a comedy sketch while the rest of the cast and assorted monstrosities are caught in a nightmarish Horror Film. There is literally no depth or exploration of the genetics and cloning science or the morality of it all, just scene after scene of half-breeds running around looking as bewildered as the audience. This has got to be the Director's worst film as he strays wildly from his usual gritty political and crime action dramas and finds himself unable to get a handle on the material. The monster makeup ranges from pretty scary too silly and is as inconsistent as the rest of the proceedings. Nothing at all comes together and the result is a laughable and embarrassing take on the profound H.G. Wells story. The still definitive version is Island of Lost Souls (1933).

    I remember watching the movie trailer on TV when I was a kid in high school. The movie was sorta interesting especially it got Val Kilmer and Marlon Brando. Now that I've been able to watch it thanks to Comcast's on-demand, well I certainly didn't miss much. The movie pretty much was so and so. So many of the actors' talent was wasted by the director and I heard there was some clashes with the director and the cast. The art of the movie could use some improvement as well as the music and camera direction. Anyways, nothing was spent on watching this film but probably not really a film you wanna watch on Saturday night. I certainly want my 1 hour and 36 minutes back.

    Third official version of the H.G. Wells novel was such a troubled production that it's fortunate it would be watchable to any degree. In any event, the story of its making is infinitely more interesting than the final result. For those not familiar with the story, it deals with a plane crash survivor, Edward Douglas (David Thewlis) adrift at sea and picked up by a passing ship, and ending up trapped on a remote island where the local mad scientist, Dr. Moreau (a hilarious Marlon Brando) has been busy turning animals into human like abominations. He's just in time to witness as the beasts start tiring of their treatment and stage a horrific uprising, while Moreau's second in command, Montgomery (an amusing Val Kilmer) goes bat *beep* crazy, and Edward becomes taken with a cat woman named Aissa (sexy Fairuza Balk). This film is indeed quite a mess, and is never terribly involving, but at least it manages to be a somewhat *intriguing* mess. The ideas at work here still make some impact, although it would have helped had there been a stronger protagonist. Thewlis, who has gone on record as saying this was a very negative experience for him, looks largely disinterested, unlike Kilmer and screen legend Brando (Brando looking very pasty faced and rotund here); they both ham it up something fierce. Balk is quite appealing, and there's also the always welcome presence of Ron Perlman, playing the Sayer of the Law. One good thing that can be said is that the creature designs by the Stan Winston Studio *are* indeed impressive, and the actors buried under the makeup all do a creditable job, especially Daniel Rigney and Mark Dacascos as the scary characters Hyena-Swine and Lo-Mai. This movie is beautiful in a visual sense, so it does have the look of quality, with production design by Graham "Grace" Walker and cinematography by William A. Fraker; it was filmed on location in Queensland, Australia. One can't help but wonder what could have been had original director Richard Stanley (the man behind the cult items "Hardware" and "Dust Devil") not been fired. As it is, legendary political thriller master John Frankenheimer ("The Manchurian Candidate", "Seven Days in May"), who was brought in to try to create something releasable, does a slick job, even if his heart wasn't really in it. Fans of the book would be advised to stick with the '32 and '77 adaptations; overall, this film does have good horror movie moments, and ends fairly well, but isn't too memorable when all is said and done. Six out of 10.

    and loses a death-match with dignity. Seriously, I can't think of any other explanation. It seems like they went out of their way to make him look silly, from the giant Mumu to the ice bucket on the top of his head. This was the third major attempt to bring H.G. Wells story to the big screen, and it really isn't an improvement over the other two. It fails in that Moreau's actions really make no sense. He seems to be mutilating these animals for the pure hell of it. They also shoe-in a love story between the protagonist and the panther girl, something all three movies did but H.G. Wells never would have done. Val Kilmner plays his associate, Montgeomery, and he at least has the virtue of being nuts from the drugs.

    Sitting through "Prophecy" director John Frankenheimer's pretentious horror fantasy "The Island of Dr. Moreau," starring Marlon Brando and Val Kilmer, may be enough to turn anybody into an animal. Presumably, the financial success of recent genetic thrillers such as "Jurassic Park" and "Species" prompted producer Edward R. Pressmen to reanimate H.G. Wells' literary classic for its third rendition. Ironically, this deeply flawed but imaginatively updated version suffers a fate similar to that of the genetic mutants created by the titular villain on his remote island. The movie opens on three plane crash survivors who have been adrift in the Java Sea for days. Two of them are killed by a shark leaving our hero, Edward Douglas (David Thewlis of "Naked"), a United Nations peace negotiator. Douglas awakens to the sight of a sailing vessel hovering over him. He collapses from exhaustion and reawakens to find Montgomery (Val Kilmer of "Tombstone") attending him. Douglas is too weak to do anything more than swoon. Eventually, the ship deposits them at an exotic island where the research center of Dr. Moreau is located. Montgomery persuades Douglas to join him, on the basis that they have a telecommunications system on the island that Douglas can use to contact the UN. As we soon learn, however, Montgomery is lying. The island is actually the home and refuge of Dr. Moreau, a brilliant geneticist who was forced into seclusion due to his controversial experiments on animals. Moreau has learned how to transform common animals into human beings, or almost human beings. Douglas finds himself trapped on the island, surrounded by Moreau's beastly creations. He tries to escape several times to no avail. First, he stumbles in on an ungodly birth scene, then finds himself in a half-man, half-animal zoo at an abandoned military airfield. Finally, Douglas meets Moreau. They argue about which way the scales of morality should tilt and dredge up Biblical passages to support their arguments. Moreau tries to explain how his experiments will help mankind. He reveals that he has discovered that the devil is a collection of genes. Moreau means to sort out those bad genes and produce an ideal human. He is even willing to accept a failure or two along the road to success, which accounts for the vast number of beast-men. Moreau keeps these ugly creatures under his thumb by means of implants which he uses to shock them into paralysis. Meanwhile, Montgomery keeps the creatures dazed and confused with narcotics. The inventive but predictable Richard Stanley & Ron Hutchinson screenplay updates the 1896 Wells novel and does a good job of establishing the action in the 1990s. The opening 40 minutes introduces audiences to everyone and everything they need to know about the plot. Sadly, the script packs no surprises. If you cannot figure out what's going to happen from one moment to the next in the film then you must be on horse tranquilizers. Suffice it to say, "Moreau" doesn't qualify as a date movie, (unless you never want to see your date again). Some of the gruesome looking creatures may even go on to inhabit the island of your dreams. Stan Winston's creature designs are impressive. His mutants look as convincing as mutants could possibly look. Sometimes, they are even nauseating. Typically, they retain the basic shape of the animal from which they were mutated so they have a beastly looking head, hands and feet, while the rest of them is hidden beneath their apparel to conserve on costs. The first grisly glimpse that Douglas gets is a multi-breasted beast mother siring an "E.T." infant. The other animals are a hideous collection of mutants with claw hands and snaggled teeth. They gallery of beast men and women appears twice as grisly, gyrating their horrid bodies as Montgomery peddles narcotics to kill them happy. Marlon Brando treats moviegoers to another of his characteristically peculiar performances. There is nothing ordinary about Brando's brilliant but eccentric Dr. Moreau. Brando stages a dramatic entrance, swathed in white garments under a pagoda-style hat, resembling a Japanese Kabuki actor in sunglasses. He tolerates the steamy island heat and wears chalky make-up to preserve his delicate skin from the sun. Metaphorically, this sun allergy relates somehow to Moreau's moral infamy; he cannot stand up to the light of morality. He appears like the great white hope in the camp of the beast men. Brando adopts the same sissified voice that he used for his Fletcher Christian in the 1962 version of "Mutiny on the Bounty." He also never appears twice in the same wardrobe. One scene finds him garbed like a nocturnal fridge raider while in another scene he appears bundled up like an Arab sultan. Audiences are meant to identify with the David Thewlis' narrator. Incidentally, Thewlis replaced Rob Morrow of CBS-TV's "Northern Exposure." A similar air of mystery clouds Val Kilmer's Montgomery. Montgomery gravitates between moments of extreme clarity and apathetic zombie like drug dazes. Either the script is purposefully vague or (more realistically) the editors sheared Kilmer's performance to reduce the film's running time to 90 minutes so they could squeeze in more showings and parlay a quick profit. Ultimately, Montgomery assumes a Luifer-like character in his apparent rivalry with Moreau. Again, the script doesn't clarify this part of the story. Is Montgomery Moreau's rival? We never know for certain. "The Island of Dr. Moreau" ranks as an ambitious but flawed horror fantasy. Anybody who relishes Frankenheimer's version of "Moreau" can hope that someday New Line Cinema will release a director's cut that restores the lost parts of the film. This well-made but routine concludes with Douglas moralizing about how Moreau's island serves as a microcosm of the world and that we must all go in fear of man's unstable nature. The only thing that audiences can really go in fear of is the sequel that might lie over the horizon.
