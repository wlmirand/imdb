  Lady Alyce Marshmorton must marry soon, and the staff of Tottney Castle have laid bets on who she'll choose, with young Albert wagering on "Mr. X." After Alyce goes to London to meet a beau (bumping into dancer Jerry Halliday, instead), she is restricted to the castle to curb her scandalous behavior.

    This 1937 film is the second adaptation of P G Wodehouse's novel of the same name, and Wodehouse himself helped write the screenplay for this version. The films stars Joan Fontaine in an early role, as Lady Alyce Marshmorton, of Tottney Castle, in England. She must marry soon, and the staff at the castle have a sweepstake on who she will choose. After the all the likely  and less likely candidates are chosen, young Albert chooses 'Mr X', knowing as he does that Lady Alyce is in love with an American man who none of the staff know. When Alyce goes to London to meet up with her secret beau, she instead bumps into American entertainer Jerry Halliday (Fred Astaire) who is in the city with his agent George (George Burns) and George's ditzy secretary Gracie (Burns' real life wife, Gracie Allen). Jerry immediately falls for Alyce, and is incorrectly led to believe that she feels the same way. He goes to Tottney Castle to try to meet her. False impressions and mistaken identities lead to a fine comedy of errors This film came after several of Astaire's pairings with Ginger Rogers, and the public's enjoyment of Astaire and Rogers together may be why A Damsel In Distress actually flopped at the box office. Joan Fontaine is no Ginger, and can not really hold her own when dancing with Astaire. They have just one number together here, and it's a very simple one. In fact, while Fontaine looks beautiful, she fails to make much of an impression at all in this film; however, she was right at the start of her career, and she went on to show that she did indeed possess buckets of talent as an actress, in such films as Rebecca (1940) and Suspicion (1941). Astaire however, is as graceful and entertaining as ever, and of course his dancing is top-notch. While he is an excellent leading man, the show is almost whipped out from under his feet by the excellent George Burns and Gracie Allen. Gracie's one-liners, her perfect delivery and her facial expressions are absolutely hilarious, and Burns is the perfect foil (it was an act which they successfully did together for several years). Astaire, Burns and Allen together have amazing chemistry, and there are some genuinely laugh-out-loud moments. The superb Gershwin score also gives the three of them a couple of terrific dance numbers together. The first  Put Me To The Test  is a very enjoyable number, but the second  Stiff Upper Lip  was absolutely mesmerising. Set in a fun fair, this dance makes full use of the sliding floors, rotating surfaces, and distorting mirrors, to produce a fantastic, fun filled dance number, which almost demands repeated viewing. It truly is a marvellous sequence and one which is surely guaranteed to make the audience smile. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this film  great dancing, lots of zingy one-liners, and a daft but funny plot make this an often overlooked, but worthwhile gem of a film. Catch it if you can!

    There are some nice things about this vintage Hollywood musical, "set" in England but almost as many demerits make it difficult to love as unreservedly as say, "Top Hat" or "Swing Time". Fred is certainly a sufficiently established persona to work without Ginger although the producers added in a little insurance, teaming him up with the husband and wife comedy duo George Burns and Gracie Allen. In fact the duo is one of the success stories, here, adding some pep to proceedings even if half of their jokes are more telegraphed than Western Union. They do however get to participate in two enjoyable dance routines with Fred, one a simpler affair with broom- heads as props and the second much more elaborate, waged in a carnival fun-house. The music of course is delightful, by the Gershwins, especially "A Foggy Day" and "Nice Work" but some of the stagings, involving singing group The Madrigals, look and sound very stilted and corny these days. The plot is slighter than snow, involving the usual coincidences and confusions before Fred's love, as ever, conquers all. The man himself is in fine hoofing form though for his solo numbers, including the "drum solo" sequence at the end. Unfortunately there are some unusual and bothersome characters too, especially the child actor playing the mischievous servant boy and the main housekeeper with his very strange and off putting predilection for singing grand-opera. I liked the actor playing the down-to- earth Lord of the manor, but his performance was likewise off-set by his sour sister, who attempts to block Fred's attempts to woo Joan Fontaine. To be fair, with the latter, you'd never tell that you were watching an actress who four years later would win a leading lady Academy Award, not that she's given much to work with here. Thankfully though, Astaire, Burns and Allen make a little go a long way, but Fred would go on to make much better Ginger-less films than this in the 40's and 50's.

    One of Fred Astaire's lesser films  possibly because he lacks a decent romantic female dancing partner  this is still a fairly entertaining example of the kind of light-hearted romantic comedy he was putting out in the 1930s. He plays an American in London who mistakenly believes he is the apple of a wealthy young lady's eye (Joan Fontaine). Many misunderstandings follow until, inevitably, Miss Fontaine realises he's right and she does, in fact, love young Fred. Most of the humour is provided by the banter between supporting stars George Burns and Gracie Allen, and their quick-fire one-liners are still pretty funny today. They're not the only ones to be given funny lines though. In one scene, the snobbish mother of Fontaine, matriarch of a British stately home, says sniffily after learning that it is the weekly open-house day, 'Well, open all the windows after they've gone.' Of course this is a fabricated world as far removed from real life as it is possible to get, and I suppose it was exactly the type of escapism people in the midst of a depression craved. I'm not quite sure why the studio chose to pair Astaire with the young Miss Fontaine, who clearly isn't a proficient dancer. Perhaps they were trying to build her up as a star. Anyway, it means that Astaire shares most of his dance numbers with Burns & Allen or goes it alone. The film's a little poorer because of it, but he's still pretty good, whether playing an unconventional drum solo while dancing to a Gershwin number, performing a comical fairground dance with his two sidekicks, or simply singing A Foggy Day in London Town in an atmospherically shot solo number.

    Fred Astaire and Burns and Allen stars with Joan Fontaine, who's "A Damsel in Distress," in the movie about love found between an American commoner and a Lord's daughter. It begins with Joan Fontaine sneaking out to meet someone in London, but she never gets there. Manservant Reginald Gardner follows her to keep her under surveillance for her mother, and in doing so gets into a scrape himself. (The help have a bet going just who's she going to marry.) Enter Fred Astaire, who's a famous personality, whose publicity man, George Burns, builds up Fred's image as a notorious lover with many notches in his belt. Gracie Allen plays George's secretary, but, with her disposition, it's clear she doesn't do much. But as usual she supplies much naivet&eacute; and spirit to the film. So all London is agog with Fred's activities. Suffice it to say, Fred and Joan meet and the rest takes care of itself. This film is another case of a good film being virtually forgotten and/or overshadowed by Fred's movies with Ginger Rogers. The biggest complaints I think most people would have with it, is that, in the beginning, it feels like an old film,(it doesn't feel timeless like Top Hat,) and, that it may feel a bit too British for some Amercians. And, also, like another reviewer has said, Joan Fontaine appears to be walking through it. Maybe the film needed a more energetic actress. Other than that, it contains outstanding musical numbers including "A Foggy Day (in Londontown)" and "Nice Work If You Can Get it" courtesy of the Gershwins. Overall, this needs to be seen more often on TCM, so that people can appreciate this overlooked Astaire gem.

    Fred Astaire, George Burns, Gracie Allen, Joan Fontaine. A DAMSEL IN DISTRESS (1937) may seem like a curiosity piece, but it's really a great, lesser-known movie. It's a fun comedy/musical in the vein of the Astaire/Rogers films of the decade. You can't really go wrong with a Fred Astaire movie, particularly from the black & white days. Astaire was so likable and charming on-screen. He was great at comedy, he could carry a tune, and brother could he ever dance. The romance plot is set up with Astaire playing an American dancer traveling abroad and Joan Fontaine playing a young noblewoman who doesn't want to marry the eligible bachelors at home. The two meet and through a series of misunderstandings, Fred comes to believe that Joan is in love with him. She isn't at first, but if you've seen enough of these light-hearted Hollywood rom-coms, you know what happens. Fontaine's servants have bets on who she will marry, and they try to influence the romantic outcome in their favor. George Burns and Gracie Allen are comedy legends. They're not known for their feature films, but they really sparkle in this one as Astaire's sidekicks. Their comedy bits are golden and they even join Fred for some dancing. The rest of the supporting cast is great, particularly Reginald Gardiner and Montagu Love. Joan Fontaine, very early in her career, is absolutely lovely. The music is from George and Ira Gershwin and is pretty good, if not as memorable as some of the music from the Astaire/Rogers flicks. I recognized "Nice Work If You Can Get It" and "A Foggy Day". There are a few wonderful dance sequences, including a wildly inventive fun house scene with Astaire, Burns, Allen, and a crowd of extras. There's also a tremendous solo routine where Astaire tap dances and plays a drum set-- with his feet. I caught this gem on TCM and I'm glad I did. I'm a huge Fred Astaire fan and this movie fits right in with his others. Plus it's got the added comedic bonus of George Burns and Gracie Allen. The movie is a lot of fun and it's got a nice little love story. It's time well spent if you're a classic movie fan. I just wish this forgotten treasure was more readily available.

    Enjoyable and frothy story of Americans Astaire, Burns, and Allen in England. Astaire falls for Joan Fontaine at first sight and vice versa. There follows confusion regarding his identity and intentions, leading her to reject, accept, reject, and accept Astaire in that order. I know -- it sounds familiar. The difference here is that Ginger Rogers is absent and there is no one to replace her. Joan Fontaine, at nineteen, had a pale, blond, virginal, winsome beauty that was dazzling, although make up overdid it and in some scenes, in close up, she looks a little debauched. She's a very appealing actress but not a dancer. She and Astaire have only one number together and her inadequacies are somewhat masked by foreground objects and camera placement. Her participation is mostly limited to hand-in-hand strolls and occasional spins. In another number, Astaire dances with Burns and Allen, two seasoned troupers, and if they aren't dancers either they march around and skip and do their steps with confidence and aplomb. Burns joked that his right leg did all the tapping while his left leg wanted to go into some other business. Astaire has two solos. One is a quick knockabout tap in the middle of a London street. The other, at the climax, sans the usual partner, is an exuberant tap-and-drum number to George and Ira Gershwin's "Nice Work If You Can Get It." It was George Gershwin's last score. He died of a brain tumor a few months before the film's release. It's not a memorable musical but rather a blithe romantic comedy that has a certain amusement quotient. And the numbers are nice. They include "A Foggy Day in London Town," sung but not danced by Astaire, that has become a standard. The plot probably has more substance than the Astaire/Rogers films but it's mainly a diverting and enjoyable trifle.

    One thing that you got a lot in the late 30s, when many of the franchises that had kept the industry going were now starting to lose appeal, was the studios putting together meaty packages of all the popular elements they had at their disposal in the hope of creating a sure-fire hit. 1937's Damsel in Distress gives us the dancing of Fred Astaire, the music of Gershwin, the writing of PG Wodehouse, plus a bevy of comedy supporting players. How could it fail? Well Fred Astaire's pairings with Ginger Rogers were beginning to lose money, and were perhaps being perceived as repetitive. Damsel in Distress seems to be an attempt to revive flagging box office takings by sending one half of the duo out on his own and putting him in a new environment with a new leading lady. While Joan Fontaine was a great actress, she was neither a singer nor a dancer, and what made the previous musicals work was the way Fred and Ginger clicked through dance  when their two characters danced together, you knew they were made for each other. You would later get the same thing when Astaire was teamed with Cyd Charisse. You're not going to get it with Fontaine. And it's not just Ginger who's missing; it seems to have been RKO's deliberate intention to remove all the familiar faces from the supporting cast  no Eric Blore, no Erik Rhodes and not even Edward Everett-Horton. Those jokers were half the fun! Instead, we get "cockney" lad Harry Watson, who presumably grew up to become Dick van Dyke's dialogue coach, and comedy couple George Burns and Gracie Allen, who are about as funny as cancer. Of course the Gershwins were always good, and Damsel in Distress contains some of their best songs. The choreography of Hermes Pan plays nicely off the lively tunes as well. However, like most musicals of the period, the song and dance numbers are simply showpieces for which the narrative must take a break. The Fun House routine, for which the picture won its only Oscar, is very amusing, although it shows how Hermes Pan was now more interested in props and elaboration than showcasing the talent of Fred. The simple flow of "Things are Looking Up" is actually more satisfying and sits better with the rest of the picture. Director George Stevens was someone who could always be relied upon to treat even the silliest of stories with grace and tenderness. The slow, measured pace he encourages from his actors, often with long moments between the dialogue in which the characters emote wordlessly, give great weight to the romantic scenes. The best "Stevens" moment from Damsel in Distress has to be when Fontaine confesses her feelings to Astaire at the cottage. As in many such scenes, we gradually move in from mid-shot to close-up, but Stevens begins that first close-up of Fontaine with her face moving into the frame, giving the moment that little bit more intensity. The steady pace of a George Stevens picture also often brought out the best in the comedy, although unfortunately there is not enough raw material here. As for poor old PG Wodehouse, you can just about see traces of his style, the basic plot being a typical Wodehouse blend of warm romance and gentle satire with an emphasis on the interplay between aristocrats and their servants. Someone probably thought this would go well with sassy sophistication and stuffy vs. modern dynamic of Astaire's musical comedies, but it clashes horribly. Few of the cast, with the exception of Reginald Gardiner and Montagu Love, look like they belong here. Incidentally the aforementioned Messrs. Blore, Rhodes and Everett-Horton would all fit very nicely into Wodehouse world. The trouble then with Damsel in Distress is that it throws together all its (mostly) worthy elements without any consideration of how they might work together. Bits and pieces of it are nice, and the songs are excellent, but overall it's a rather bland affair. The picture was predictably a great mistake that did no favours for Astaire's falling star, or Fontaine's rising one.

    Joan Fontaine is "A Damsel in Distress" in this 1937 musical starring Fred Astaire, George Burns, and Gracie Allen. The plot, what there is of it, is about a British woman (Fontaine) in love with an American, who is mistaken for Astaire, a musical comedy star. The film, directed by George Stevens, contains some wonderful Gershwin music, including "Nice Work if You Can Get It" and "A Foggy Day." The best scene is the "Stiff Upper Lip" number, which takes place in a fun house. Astaire's singing voice sounds more robust in this film than it does in others, and he has a couple of excellent dance numbers. Burns plays his over the top publicist and Allen is Burns' secretary. She's hilarious. The problem, as others have pointed out, is Fontaine, who has to dance with Astaire at the end of the film. Stevens could easily have used a double because he shows the dance in a long shot, and it takes place among the trees. I would have thought it was a double except the dancing was so lousy. Definitely worth seeing despite its flaws.

    "A Damsel in Distress" is definitely not one of Fred Astaire's better musicals. But even Astaire's bad films always had some good moments. In "Damsel," Astaire is Jerry Halliday, an American musical star who is in London on a personal appearance tour. He meets Lady Alice Marshmorton (19-year-old Joan Fontaine), a beautiful English heiress, who hops into the back of a cab he is taking to escape a mob of admirers. Jerry believes that Alice is being forced into a marriage by her rich aunt. He tries to rescue her from her family's country manor house, but soon discovers that the house staff is laying bets on which suitor Lady Alice will marry. Keggs (Reginald Gardiner) the conniving butler, and Albert (Harry Watson), the bratty house boy, each take turns alternately helping and sabotaging Lady Alice's romance with Jerry to make sure they win the bet. This musical has numerous problems. First, there is the plot, based on a novel by P.G. Wodehouse (who co-wrote the screenplay). The story is slow, painful, and nerve-grating. When Fred is not dancing, we have to endure endless annoying scenes of (a) Fred romancing Joan Fontaine or (b) Keggs and Albert conniving against them and each other. The butler and the house boy are especially irritating. They are one-dimensional stock villain characters, the kind of guys you just want to punch in the mouth. You wish they would get off the screen and let Fred dance. Astaire suffers in the absence of his usual partner, Ginger Rogers. Joan Fontaine is a lackluster leading lady in this film, and is miscast in a musical. She has little going for her, character-wise, other than her lovely face and beautiful smile. George Burns and Gracie Allen are along for the ride, as Jerry's publicist and his ditzy secretary. The duo adds some sorely needed chemistry to the plot, and Gracie has some funny lines, but she is also very annoying at times. The direction of the movie by George Stevens is not well done. At times, the cinematography is horrible and off-focus. There are a number of outdoor scenes set on extremely foggy streets, to try to convince the audience that we are in London, not Hollywood. (They must have used tons of dry ice in this movie.) On the plus side, the songs by George and Ira Gershwin are terrific, and have become classic song standards. And of course, the dancing in the movie is exceptional, thanks to Astaire and his choreographer, Hermes Pan. But the musical and dance numbers are ill-used and ill-staged. At times, the cast seems to start singing and dancing because, well, it's time for them to start singing and dancing. The musical numbers seem randomly inserted into the meandering plot. (At one point, the butler steps outside the manor house and breaks into an operetta solo for no clear reason.) The numbers include:  "I'm Dancing and I Can't Be Bothered Now" -- Fred dances well on a foggy traffic-filled London street. He does some great "cane-twirling" with a rolled umbrella -- but the number ends too soon when Fred jumps on a passing double-decker bus. (In the Broadway musical, "Crazy For You," Harry Groener did a much better version of this number with a group of chorus girls.)  "Put Me To The Test" -- Fred, George, and Gracie do a trio tap dance in an English cottage. George and Gracie match Fred step for step, but the number ends poorly with everyone kicking each other for no reason.  "Stiff Upper Lip" (The Fun House Number) -- At an amusement park fun house, Fred, George, and Gracie have fun dancing on the revolving floor, rotating barrel, and with the fun house mirrors. It's the best number of the movie, but it gets a little repetitious at times.  "Things Are Looking Up" -- Fred and Joan Fontaine do their one dance number together in the film, prancing around the back woods of the country manor estate. Fortunately, it's a very simple dance number because Joan is not a great dancer.  "A Foggy Day in London Town" -- Fred wanders around the foggy manor estate at night, crooning about the foggy day when he first met Joan in London. At times, he looks as if he's not sure which way he's going in the fog -- much like the musical number itself.  "Nice Work If You Can Get It" -- A great song that is misused in the movie. During a social event at the manor house, Fred gets drawn into a chorus of dour-faced singers who are haphazardly singing this song. Each time Fred joins in, the other singers look at him as if they wish he would leave. (Again, Harry Groener did a better dance number with this song in "Crazy For You.")  "Drum Dance Number" -- As Fred and Joan are eloping, Fred has to stop and do one final tap dance number while banging a group of drums. As usual, it's a great dance number. But there's absolutely no need for it, except to prolong the movie. The most contrived moment in the film comes when Fred decides to leap off a high stone balcony at the country estate in order to prove his love for Joan Fontaine. As he leaps from the balcony, he finds a conveniently-placed trapeze -- that's right, a *trapeze* -- hanging from a nearby tree. Fred (or rather, a stuntman in Fred's clothes) grabs the trapeze and swings to the ground from it. The movie is worth owning on DVD for the dance numbers alone, but you feel indebted to the guy who invented the Fast Forward button on your remote. The >>FF button allows you to skip through the other, boring scenes in the film to get to the dance numbers.

    There's a perfectly good reason why Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers made nine films together between 1933 and 1939  the pairing worked! Astaire's toe-tappin' class was complemented perfectly by the light-hearted comedic charms of his female co-star, and that he and Rogers never overshadowed each other was crucial to the success of their collaborations. 'A Damsel in Distress (1937)' sees Astaire, for the first time since his debut, momentarily set adrift from this celebrated partnership. It's a pleasant and enjoyable musical comedy, but it doesn't entirely work because Fred is clearly the main attraction, creating an imbalance of tone that feels somehow unsatisfying. Joan Fontaine, in an early role, fills in as the primary romantic interest; she's not particularly convincing here  but, geez, she's gorgeous!  and her charms would carry her along sufficiently until her superb star-making performance in Alfred Hitchcock's 'Rebecca (1940).' Husband-and-wife vaudeville duo George Burns and Gracie Allen provide most of the welcome comic relief, which is basically an extension of their popular stage act. 'A Damsel in Distress' was directed by George Stevens {who had previously worked with Astaire in 'Swing Time (1936)} and adapted by P.G. Wodehouse from his own 1919 novel. Jerry Halliday (Astaire) is a famous American dancer, frustrated by all his publicity, who falls in love with the beautiful Lady Alyce Marshmorton (Fontaine), whom he believes has inexplicably fallen in love with him. What Jerry doesn't realise is that Lady Alyce has actually fallen in love with a different (unseen) American, and that he is being misled by the staff at Tottney Castle, who have placed bets on who their mistress will eventually marry. Reginald Gardiner hilariously hams it up as Keggs, the scheming butler who apparently can't resist belting out an opera when the appropriate music starts playing. Burns and Allen provide the necessary supporting back-up (even matching Astaire step-for-step in the "Fun House" musical number), with the latter playing the ditsy eccentric with perfect composure, utilising more cringeworthy puns than Groucho Marx in 'Duck Soup (1933).' George Gershwin played a significant role in getting Stevens' film made in the first place, and his songs were completed before script-work actually began. Tragically, the composer died from a brain tumour before production was completed. There were not quite as many musical numbers as I had expected, and very few stood out in my memory like Astaire's greatest tunes. Nevertheless, the "Fun House" number was an elaborate, precisely-orchestrated dance sequence, making superb use of reflections, moving sets and confined spaces. Most memorable of all was Astaire's rendition of "A Foggy Day (In London Town)," performed as the actor traipses gracefully through a fog-ridden forest. Joan Fontaine was the first actress to admit her insufficient capacity to play a convincing terpsichorean, and so she only attempts it once, and, all things considered, she doesn't embarrass herself all that much. She is, of course, always a joy to watch, but her character's "I love you now I hate you no, wait, I love you again" routine is overdone and unpersuasive.

    This 1937 film is the second adaptation of P G Wodehouse's novel of the same name, and Wodehouse himself helped write the screenplay for this version. The films stars Joan Fontaine in an early role, as Lady Alyce Marshmorton, of Tottney Castle, in England. She must marry soon, and the staff at the castle have a sweepstake on who she will choose. After the all the likely  and less likely candidates are chosen, young Albert chooses 'Mr X', knowing as he does that Lady Alyce is in love with an American man who none of the staff know. When Alyce goes to London to meet up with her secret beau, she instead bumps into American entertainer Jerry Halliday (Fred Astaire) who is in the city with his agent George (George Burns) and George's ditzy secretary Gracie (Burns' real life wife, Gracie Allen). Jerry immediately falls for Alyce, and is incorrectly led to believe that she feels the same way. He goes to Tottney Castle to try to meet her. False impressions and mistaken identities lead to a fine comedy of errors This film came after several of Astaire's pairings with Ginger Rogers, and the public's enjoyment of Astaire and Rogers together may be why A Damsel In Distress actually flopped at the box office. Joan Fontaine is no Ginger, and can not really hold her own when dancing with Astaire. They have just one number together here, and it's a very simple one. In fact, while Fontaine looks beautiful, she fails to make much of an impression at all in this film; however, she was right at the start of her career, and she went on to show that she did indeed possess buckets of talent as an actress, in such films as Rebecca (1940) and Suspicion (1941). Astaire however, is as graceful and entertaining as ever, and of course his dancing is top-notch. While he is an excellent leading man, the show is almost whipped out from under his feet by the excellent George Burns and Gracie Allen. Gracie's one-liners, her perfect delivery and her facial expressions are absolutely hilarious, and Burns is the perfect foil (it was an act which they successfully did together for several years). Astaire, Burns and Allen together have amazing chemistry, and there are some genuinely laugh-out-loud moments. The superb Gershwin score also gives the three of them a couple of terrific dance numbers together. The first  Put Me To The Test  is a very enjoyable number, but the second  Stiff Upper Lip  was absolutely mesmerising. Set in a fun fair, this dance makes full use of the sliding floors, rotating surfaces, and distorting mirrors, to produce a fantastic, fun filled dance number, which almost demands repeated viewing. It truly is a marvellous sequence and one which is surely guaranteed to make the audience smile. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this film  great dancing, lots of zingy one-liners, and a daft but funny plot make this an often overlooked, but worthwhile gem of a film. Catch it if you can!

    There are some nice things about this vintage Hollywood musical, "set" in England but almost as many demerits make it difficult to love as unreservedly as say, "Top Hat" or "Swing Time". Fred is certainly a sufficiently established persona to work without Ginger although the producers added in a little insurance, teaming him up with the husband and wife comedy duo George Burns and Gracie Allen. In fact the duo is one of the success stories, here, adding some pep to proceedings even if half of their jokes are more telegraphed than Western Union. They do however get to participate in two enjoyable dance routines with Fred, one a simpler affair with broom- heads as props and the second much more elaborate, waged in a carnival fun-house. The music of course is delightful, by the Gershwins, especially "A Foggy Day" and "Nice Work" but some of the stagings, involving singing group The Madrigals, look and sound very stilted and corny these days. The plot is slighter than snow, involving the usual coincidences and confusions before Fred's love, as ever, conquers all. The man himself is in fine hoofing form though for his solo numbers, including the "drum solo" sequence at the end. Unfortunately there are some unusual and bothersome characters too, especially the child actor playing the mischievous servant boy and the main housekeeper with his very strange and off putting predilection for singing grand-opera. I liked the actor playing the down-to- earth Lord of the manor, but his performance was likewise off-set by his sour sister, who attempts to block Fred's attempts to woo Joan Fontaine. To be fair, with the latter, you'd never tell that you were watching an actress who four years later would win a leading lady Academy Award, not that she's given much to work with here. Thankfully though, Astaire, Burns and Allen make a little go a long way, but Fred would go on to make much better Ginger-less films than this in the 40's and 50's.

    One of Fred Astaire's lesser films  possibly because he lacks a decent romantic female dancing partner  this is still a fairly entertaining example of the kind of light-hearted romantic comedy he was putting out in the 1930s. He plays an American in London who mistakenly believes he is the apple of a wealthy young lady's eye (Joan Fontaine). Many misunderstandings follow until, inevitably, Miss Fontaine realises he's right and she does, in fact, love young Fred. Most of the humour is provided by the banter between supporting stars George Burns and Gracie Allen, and their quick-fire one-liners are still pretty funny today. They're not the only ones to be given funny lines though. In one scene, the snobbish mother of Fontaine, matriarch of a British stately home, says sniffily after learning that it is the weekly open-house day, 'Well, open all the windows after they've gone.' Of course this is a fabricated world as far removed from real life as it is possible to get, and I suppose it was exactly the type of escapism people in the midst of a depression craved. I'm not quite sure why the studio chose to pair Astaire with the young Miss Fontaine, who clearly isn't a proficient dancer. Perhaps they were trying to build her up as a star. Anyway, it means that Astaire shares most of his dance numbers with Burns & Allen or goes it alone. The film's a little poorer because of it, but he's still pretty good, whether playing an unconventional drum solo while dancing to a Gershwin number, performing a comical fairground dance with his two sidekicks, or simply singing A Foggy Day in London Town in an atmospherically shot solo number.

    Fred Astaire and Burns and Allen stars with Joan Fontaine, who's "A Damsel in Distress," in the movie about love found between an American commoner and a Lord's daughter. It begins with Joan Fontaine sneaking out to meet someone in London, but she never gets there. Manservant Reginald Gardner follows her to keep her under surveillance for her mother, and in doing so gets into a scrape himself. (The help have a bet going just who's she going to marry.) Enter Fred Astaire, who's a famous personality, whose publicity man, George Burns, builds up Fred's image as a notorious lover with many notches in his belt. Gracie Allen plays George's secretary, but, with her disposition, it's clear she doesn't do much. But as usual she supplies much naivet&eacute; and spirit to the film. So all London is agog with Fred's activities. Suffice it to say, Fred and Joan meet and the rest takes care of itself. This film is another case of a good film being virtually forgotten and/or overshadowed by Fred's movies with Ginger Rogers. The biggest complaints I think most people would have with it, is that, in the beginning, it feels like an old film,(it doesn't feel timeless like Top Hat,) and, that it may feel a bit too British for some Amercians. And, also, like another reviewer has said, Joan Fontaine appears to be walking through it. Maybe the film needed a more energetic actress. Other than that, it contains outstanding musical numbers including "A Foggy Day (in Londontown)" and "Nice Work If You Can Get it" courtesy of the Gershwins. Overall, this needs to be seen more often on TCM, so that people can appreciate this overlooked Astaire gem.

    Fred Astaire, George Burns, Gracie Allen, Joan Fontaine. A DAMSEL IN DISTRESS (1937) may seem like a curiosity piece, but it's really a great, lesser-known movie. It's a fun comedy/musical in the vein of the Astaire/Rogers films of the decade. You can't really go wrong with a Fred Astaire movie, particularly from the black & white days. Astaire was so likable and charming on-screen. He was great at comedy, he could carry a tune, and brother could he ever dance. The romance plot is set up with Astaire playing an American dancer traveling abroad and Joan Fontaine playing a young noblewoman who doesn't want to marry the eligible bachelors at home. The two meet and through a series of misunderstandings, Fred comes to believe that Joan is in love with him. She isn't at first, but if you've seen enough of these light-hearted Hollywood rom-coms, you know what happens. Fontaine's servants have bets on who she will marry, and they try to influence the romantic outcome in their favor. George Burns and Gracie Allen are comedy legends. They're not known for their feature films, but they really sparkle in this one as Astaire's sidekicks. Their comedy bits are golden and they even join Fred for some dancing. The rest of the supporting cast is great, particularly Reginald Gardiner and Montagu Love. Joan Fontaine, very early in her career, is absolutely lovely. The music is from George and Ira Gershwin and is pretty good, if not as memorable as some of the music from the Astaire/Rogers flicks. I recognized "Nice Work If You Can Get It" and "A Foggy Day". There are a few wonderful dance sequences, including a wildly inventive fun house scene with Astaire, Burns, Allen, and a crowd of extras. There's also a tremendous solo routine where Astaire tap dances and plays a drum set-- with his feet. I caught this gem on TCM and I'm glad I did. I'm a huge Fred Astaire fan and this movie fits right in with his others. Plus it's got the added comedic bonus of George Burns and Gracie Allen. The movie is a lot of fun and it's got a nice little love story. It's time well spent if you're a classic movie fan. I just wish this forgotten treasure was more readily available.

    Enjoyable and frothy story of Americans Astaire, Burns, and Allen in England. Astaire falls for Joan Fontaine at first sight and vice versa. There follows confusion regarding his identity and intentions, leading her to reject, accept, reject, and accept Astaire in that order. I know -- it sounds familiar. The difference here is that Ginger Rogers is absent and there is no one to replace her. Joan Fontaine, at nineteen, had a pale, blond, virginal, winsome beauty that was dazzling, although make up overdid it and in some scenes, in close up, she looks a little debauched. She's a very appealing actress but not a dancer. She and Astaire have only one number together and her inadequacies are somewhat masked by foreground objects and camera placement. Her participation is mostly limited to hand-in-hand strolls and occasional spins. In another number, Astaire dances with Burns and Allen, two seasoned troupers, and if they aren't dancers either they march around and skip and do their steps with confidence and aplomb. Burns joked that his right leg did all the tapping while his left leg wanted to go into some other business. Astaire has two solos. One is a quick knockabout tap in the middle of a London street. The other, at the climax, sans the usual partner, is an exuberant tap-and-drum number to George and Ira Gershwin's "Nice Work If You Can Get It." It was George Gershwin's last score. He died of a brain tumor a few months before the film's release. It's not a memorable musical but rather a blithe romantic comedy that has a certain amusement quotient. And the numbers are nice. They include "A Foggy Day in London Town," sung but not danced by Astaire, that has become a standard. The plot probably has more substance than the Astaire/Rogers films but it's mainly a diverting and enjoyable trifle.

    One thing that you got a lot in the late 30s, when many of the franchises that had kept the industry going were now starting to lose appeal, was the studios putting together meaty packages of all the popular elements they had at their disposal in the hope of creating a sure-fire hit. 1937's Damsel in Distress gives us the dancing of Fred Astaire, the music of Gershwin, the writing of PG Wodehouse, plus a bevy of comedy supporting players. How could it fail? Well Fred Astaire's pairings with Ginger Rogers were beginning to lose money, and were perhaps being perceived as repetitive. Damsel in Distress seems to be an attempt to revive flagging box office takings by sending one half of the duo out on his own and putting him in a new environment with a new leading lady. While Joan Fontaine was a great actress, she was neither a singer nor a dancer, and what made the previous musicals work was the way Fred and Ginger clicked through dance  when their two characters danced together, you knew they were made for each other. You would later get the same thing when Astaire was teamed with Cyd Charisse. You're not going to get it with Fontaine. And it's not just Ginger who's missing; it seems to have been RKO's deliberate intention to remove all the familiar faces from the supporting cast  no Eric Blore, no Erik Rhodes and not even Edward Everett-Horton. Those jokers were half the fun! Instead, we get "cockney" lad Harry Watson, who presumably grew up to become Dick van Dyke's dialogue coach, and comedy couple George Burns and Gracie Allen, who are about as funny as cancer. Of course the Gershwins were always good, and Damsel in Distress contains some of their best songs. The choreography of Hermes Pan plays nicely off the lively tunes as well. However, like most musicals of the period, the song and dance numbers are simply showpieces for which the narrative must take a break. The Fun House routine, for which the picture won its only Oscar, is very amusing, although it shows how Hermes Pan was now more interested in props and elaboration than showcasing the talent of Fred. The simple flow of "Things are Looking Up" is actually more satisfying and sits better with the rest of the picture. Director George Stevens was someone who could always be relied upon to treat even the silliest of stories with grace and tenderness. The slow, measured pace he encourages from his actors, often with long moments between the dialogue in which the characters emote wordlessly, give great weight to the romantic scenes. The best "Stevens" moment from Damsel in Distress has to be when Fontaine confesses her feelings to Astaire at the cottage. As in many such scenes, we gradually move in from mid-shot to close-up, but Stevens begins that first close-up of Fontaine with her face moving into the frame, giving the moment that little bit more intensity. The steady pace of a George Stevens picture also often brought out the best in the comedy, although unfortunately there is not enough raw material here. As for poor old PG Wodehouse, you can just about see traces of his style, the basic plot being a typical Wodehouse blend of warm romance and gentle satire with an emphasis on the interplay between aristocrats and their servants. Someone probably thought this would go well with sassy sophistication and stuffy vs. modern dynamic of Astaire's musical comedies, but it clashes horribly. Few of the cast, with the exception of Reginald Gardiner and Montagu Love, look like they belong here. Incidentally the aforementioned Messrs. Blore, Rhodes and Everett-Horton would all fit very nicely into Wodehouse world. The trouble then with Damsel in Distress is that it throws together all its (mostly) worthy elements without any consideration of how they might work together. Bits and pieces of it are nice, and the songs are excellent, but overall it's a rather bland affair. The picture was predictably a great mistake that did no favours for Astaire's falling star, or Fontaine's rising one.

    Joan Fontaine is "A Damsel in Distress" in this 1937 musical starring Fred Astaire, George Burns, and Gracie Allen. The plot, what there is of it, is about a British woman (Fontaine) in love with an American, who is mistaken for Astaire, a musical comedy star. The film, directed by George Stevens, contains some wonderful Gershwin music, including "Nice Work if You Can Get It" and "A Foggy Day." The best scene is the "Stiff Upper Lip" number, which takes place in a fun house. Astaire's singing voice sounds more robust in this film than it does in others, and he has a couple of excellent dance numbers. Burns plays his over the top publicist and Allen is Burns' secretary. She's hilarious. The problem, as others have pointed out, is Fontaine, who has to dance with Astaire at the end of the film. Stevens could easily have used a double because he shows the dance in a long shot, and it takes place among the trees. I would have thought it was a double except the dancing was so lousy. Definitely worth seeing despite its flaws.

    "A Damsel in Distress" is definitely not one of Fred Astaire's better musicals. But even Astaire's bad films always had some good moments. In "Damsel," Astaire is Jerry Halliday, an American musical star who is in London on a personal appearance tour. He meets Lady Alice Marshmorton (19-year-old Joan Fontaine), a beautiful English heiress, who hops into the back of a cab he is taking to escape a mob of admirers. Jerry believes that Alice is being forced into a marriage by her rich aunt. He tries to rescue her from her family's country manor house, but soon discovers that the house staff is laying bets on which suitor Lady Alice will marry. Keggs (Reginald Gardiner) the conniving butler, and Albert (Harry Watson), the bratty house boy, each take turns alternately helping and sabotaging Lady Alice's romance with Jerry to make sure they win the bet. This musical has numerous problems. First, there is the plot, based on a novel by P.G. Wodehouse (who co-wrote the screenplay). The story is slow, painful, and nerve-grating. When Fred is not dancing, we have to endure endless annoying scenes of (a) Fred romancing Joan Fontaine or (b) Keggs and Albert conniving against them and each other. The butler and the house boy are especially irritating. They are one-dimensional stock villain characters, the kind of guys you just want to punch in the mouth. You wish they would get off the screen and let Fred dance. Astaire suffers in the absence of his usual partner, Ginger Rogers. Joan Fontaine is a lackluster leading lady in this film, and is miscast in a musical. She has little going for her, character-wise, other than her lovely face and beautiful smile. George Burns and Gracie Allen are along for the ride, as Jerry's publicist and his ditzy secretary. The duo adds some sorely needed chemistry to the plot, and Gracie has some funny lines, but she is also very annoying at times. The direction of the movie by George Stevens is not well done. At times, the cinematography is horrible and off-focus. There are a number of outdoor scenes set on extremely foggy streets, to try to convince the audience that we are in London, not Hollywood. (They must have used tons of dry ice in this movie.) On the plus side, the songs by George and Ira Gershwin are terrific, and have become classic song standards. And of course, the dancing in the movie is exceptional, thanks to Astaire and his choreographer, Hermes Pan. But the musical and dance numbers are ill-used and ill-staged. At times, the cast seems to start singing and dancing because, well, it's time for them to start singing and dancing. The musical numbers seem randomly inserted into the meandering plot. (At one point, the butler steps outside the manor house and breaks into an operetta solo for no clear reason.) The numbers include:  "I'm Dancing and I Can't Be Bothered Now" -- Fred dances well on a foggy traffic-filled London street. He does some great "cane-twirling" with a rolled umbrella -- but the number ends too soon when Fred jumps on a passing double-decker bus. (In the Broadway musical, "Crazy For You," Harry Groener did a much better version of this number with a group of chorus girls.)  "Put Me To The Test" -- Fred, George, and Gracie do a trio tap dance in an English cottage. George and Gracie match Fred step for step, but the number ends poorly with everyone kicking each other for no reason.  "Stiff Upper Lip" (The Fun House Number) -- At an amusement park fun house, Fred, George, and Gracie have fun dancing on the revolving floor, rotating barrel, and with the fun house mirrors. It's the best number of the movie, but it gets a little repetitious at times.  "Things Are Looking Up" -- Fred and Joan Fontaine do their one dance number together in the film, prancing around the back woods of the country manor estate. Fortunately, it's a very simple dance number because Joan is not a great dancer.  "A Foggy Day in London Town" -- Fred wanders around the foggy manor estate at night, crooning about the foggy day when he first met Joan in London. At times, he looks as if he's not sure which way he's going in the fog -- much like the musical number itself.  "Nice Work If You Can Get It" -- A great song that is misused in the movie. During a social event at the manor house, Fred gets drawn into a chorus of dour-faced singers who are haphazardly singing this song. Each time Fred joins in, the other singers look at him as if they wish he would leave. (Again, Harry Groener did a better dance number with this song in "Crazy For You.")  "Drum Dance Number" -- As Fred and Joan are eloping, Fred has to stop and do one final tap dance number while banging a group of drums. As usual, it's a great dance number. But there's absolutely no need for it, except to prolong the movie. The most contrived moment in the film comes when Fred decides to leap off a high stone balcony at the country estate in order to prove his love for Joan Fontaine. As he leaps from the balcony, he finds a conveniently-placed trapeze -- that's right, a *trapeze* -- hanging from a nearby tree. Fred (or rather, a stuntman in Fred's clothes) grabs the trapeze and swings to the ground from it. The movie is worth owning on DVD for the dance numbers alone, but you feel indebted to the guy who invented the Fast Forward button on your remote. The >>FF button allows you to skip through the other, boring scenes in the film to get to the dance numbers.

    There's a perfectly good reason why Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers made nine films together between 1933 and 1939  the pairing worked! Astaire's toe-tappin' class was complemented perfectly by the light-hearted comedic charms of his female co-star, and that he and Rogers never overshadowed each other was crucial to the success of their collaborations. 'A Damsel in Distress (1937)' sees Astaire, for the first time since his debut, momentarily set adrift from this celebrated partnership. It's a pleasant and enjoyable musical comedy, but it doesn't entirely work because Fred is clearly the main attraction, creating an imbalance of tone that feels somehow unsatisfying. Joan Fontaine, in an early role, fills in as the primary romantic interest; she's not particularly convincing here  but, geez, she's gorgeous!  and her charms would carry her along sufficiently until her superb star-making performance in Alfred Hitchcock's 'Rebecca (1940).' Husband-and-wife vaudeville duo George Burns and Gracie Allen provide most of the welcome comic relief, which is basically an extension of their popular stage act. 'A Damsel in Distress' was directed by George Stevens {who had previously worked with Astaire in 'Swing Time (1936)} and adapted by P.G. Wodehouse from his own 1919 novel. Jerry Halliday (Astaire) is a famous American dancer, frustrated by all his publicity, who falls in love with the beautiful Lady Alyce Marshmorton (Fontaine), whom he believes has inexplicably fallen in love with him. What Jerry doesn't realise is that Lady Alyce has actually fallen in love with a different (unseen) American, and that he is being misled by the staff at Tottney Castle, who have placed bets on who their mistress will eventually marry. Reginald Gardiner hilariously hams it up as Keggs, the scheming butler who apparently can't resist belting out an opera when the appropriate music starts playing. Burns and Allen provide the necessary supporting back-up (even matching Astaire step-for-step in the "Fun House" musical number), with the latter playing the ditsy eccentric with perfect composure, utilising more cringeworthy puns than Groucho Marx in 'Duck Soup (1933).' George Gershwin played a significant role in getting Stevens' film made in the first place, and his songs were completed before script-work actually began. Tragically, the composer died from a brain tumour before production was completed. There were not quite as many musical numbers as I had expected, and very few stood out in my memory like Astaire's greatest tunes. Nevertheless, the "Fun House" number was an elaborate, precisely-orchestrated dance sequence, making superb use of reflections, moving sets and confined spaces. Most memorable of all was Astaire's rendition of "A Foggy Day (In London Town)," performed as the actor traipses gracefully through a fog-ridden forest. Joan Fontaine was the first actress to admit her insufficient capacity to play a convincing terpsichorean, and so she only attempts it once, and, all things considered, she doesn't embarrass herself all that much. She is, of course, always a joy to watch, but her character's "I love you now I hate you no, wait, I love you again" routine is overdone and unpersuasive.

    This 1937 film is the second adaptation of P G Wodehouse's novel of the same name, and Wodehouse himself helped write the screenplay for this version. The films stars Joan Fontaine in an early role, as Lady Alyce Marshmorton, of Tottney Castle, in England. She must marry soon, and the staff at the castle have a sweepstake on who she will choose. After the all the likely  and less likely candidates are chosen, young Albert chooses 'Mr X', knowing as he does that Lady Alyce is in love with an American man who none of the staff know. When Alyce goes to London to meet up with her secret beau, she instead bumps into American entertainer Jerry Halliday (Fred Astaire) who is in the city with his agent George (George Burns) and George's ditzy secretary Gracie (Burns' real life wife, Gracie Allen). Jerry immediately falls for Alyce, and is incorrectly led to believe that she feels the same way. He goes to Tottney Castle to try to meet her. False impressions and mistaken identities lead to a fine comedy of errors This film came after several of Astaire's pairings with Ginger Rogers, and the public's enjoyment of Astaire and Rogers together may be why A Damsel In Distress actually flopped at the box office. Joan Fontaine is no Ginger, and can not really hold her own when dancing with Astaire. They have just one number together here, and it's a very simple one. In fact, while Fontaine looks beautiful, she fails to make much of an impression at all in this film; however, she was right at the start of her career, and she went on to show that she did indeed possess buckets of talent as an actress, in such films as Rebecca (1940) and Suspicion (1941). Astaire however, is as graceful and entertaining as ever, and of course his dancing is top-notch. While he is an excellent leading man, the show is almost whipped out from under his feet by the excellent George Burns and Gracie Allen. Gracie's one-liners, her perfect delivery and her facial expressions are absolutely hilarious, and Burns is the perfect foil (it was an act which they successfully did together for several years). Astaire, Burns and Allen together have amazing chemistry, and there are some genuinely laugh-out-loud moments. The superb Gershwin score also gives the three of them a couple of terrific dance numbers together. The first  Put Me To The Test  is a very enjoyable number, but the second  Stiff Upper Lip  was absolutely mesmerising. Set in a fun fair, this dance makes full use of the sliding floors, rotating surfaces, and distorting mirrors, to produce a fantastic, fun filled dance number, which almost demands repeated viewing. It truly is a marvellous sequence and one which is surely guaranteed to make the audience smile. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this film  great dancing, lots of zingy one-liners, and a daft but funny plot make this an often overlooked, but worthwhile gem of a film. Catch it if you can!

    There are some nice things about this vintage Hollywood musical, "set" in England but almost as many demerits make it difficult to love as unreservedly as say, "Top Hat" or "Swing Time". Fred is certainly a sufficiently established persona to work without Ginger although the producers added in a little insurance, teaming him up with the husband and wife comedy duo George Burns and Gracie Allen. In fact the duo is one of the success stories, here, adding some pep to proceedings even if half of their jokes are more telegraphed than Western Union. They do however get to participate in two enjoyable dance routines with Fred, one a simpler affair with broom- heads as props and the second much more elaborate, waged in a carnival fun-house. The music of course is delightful, by the Gershwins, especially "A Foggy Day" and "Nice Work" but some of the stagings, involving singing group The Madrigals, look and sound very stilted and corny these days. The plot is slighter than snow, involving the usual coincidences and confusions before Fred's love, as ever, conquers all. The man himself is in fine hoofing form though for his solo numbers, including the "drum solo" sequence at the end. Unfortunately there are some unusual and bothersome characters too, especially the child actor playing the mischievous servant boy and the main housekeeper with his very strange and off putting predilection for singing grand-opera. I liked the actor playing the down-to- earth Lord of the manor, but his performance was likewise off-set by his sour sister, who attempts to block Fred's attempts to woo Joan Fontaine. To be fair, with the latter, you'd never tell that you were watching an actress who four years later would win a leading lady Academy Award, not that she's given much to work with here. Thankfully though, Astaire, Burns and Allen make a little go a long way, but Fred would go on to make much better Ginger-less films than this in the 40's and 50's.

    One of Fred Astaire's lesser films  possibly because he lacks a decent romantic female dancing partner  this is still a fairly entertaining example of the kind of light-hearted romantic comedy he was putting out in the 1930s. He plays an American in London who mistakenly believes he is the apple of a wealthy young lady's eye (Joan Fontaine). Many misunderstandings follow until, inevitably, Miss Fontaine realises he's right and she does, in fact, love young Fred. Most of the humour is provided by the banter between supporting stars George Burns and Gracie Allen, and their quick-fire one-liners are still pretty funny today. They're not the only ones to be given funny lines though. In one scene, the snobbish mother of Fontaine, matriarch of a British stately home, says sniffily after learning that it is the weekly open-house day, 'Well, open all the windows after they've gone.' Of course this is a fabricated world as far removed from real life as it is possible to get, and I suppose it was exactly the type of escapism people in the midst of a depression craved. I'm not quite sure why the studio chose to pair Astaire with the young Miss Fontaine, who clearly isn't a proficient dancer. Perhaps they were trying to build her up as a star. Anyway, it means that Astaire shares most of his dance numbers with Burns & Allen or goes it alone. The film's a little poorer because of it, but he's still pretty good, whether playing an unconventional drum solo while dancing to a Gershwin number, performing a comical fairground dance with his two sidekicks, or simply singing A Foggy Day in London Town in an atmospherically shot solo number.

    Fred Astaire and Burns and Allen stars with Joan Fontaine, who's "A Damsel in Distress," in the movie about love found between an American commoner and a Lord's daughter. It begins with Joan Fontaine sneaking out to meet someone in London, but she never gets there. Manservant Reginald Gardner follows her to keep her under surveillance for her mother, and in doing so gets into a scrape himself. (The help have a bet going just who's she going to marry.) Enter Fred Astaire, who's a famous personality, whose publicity man, George Burns, builds up Fred's image as a notorious lover with many notches in his belt. Gracie Allen plays George's secretary, but, with her disposition, it's clear she doesn't do much. But as usual she supplies much naivet&eacute; and spirit to the film. So all London is agog with Fred's activities. Suffice it to say, Fred and Joan meet and the rest takes care of itself. This film is another case of a good film being virtually forgotten and/or overshadowed by Fred's movies with Ginger Rogers. The biggest complaints I think most people would have with it, is that, in the beginning, it feels like an old film,(it doesn't feel timeless like Top Hat,) and, that it may feel a bit too British for some Amercians. And, also, like another reviewer has said, Joan Fontaine appears to be walking through it. Maybe the film needed a more energetic actress. Other than that, it contains outstanding musical numbers including "A Foggy Day (in Londontown)" and "Nice Work If You Can Get it" courtesy of the Gershwins. Overall, this needs to be seen more often on TCM, so that people can appreciate this overlooked Astaire gem.

    Fred Astaire, George Burns, Gracie Allen, Joan Fontaine. A DAMSEL IN DISTRESS (1937) may seem like a curiosity piece, but it's really a great, lesser-known movie. It's a fun comedy/musical in the vein of the Astaire/Rogers films of the decade. You can't really go wrong with a Fred Astaire movie, particularly from the black & white days. Astaire was so likable and charming on-screen. He was great at comedy, he could carry a tune, and brother could he ever dance. The romance plot is set up with Astaire playing an American dancer traveling abroad and Joan Fontaine playing a young noblewoman who doesn't want to marry the eligible bachelors at home. The two meet and through a series of misunderstandings, Fred comes to believe that Joan is in love with him. She isn't at first, but if you've seen enough of these light-hearted Hollywood rom-coms, you know what happens. Fontaine's servants have bets on who she will marry, and they try to influence the romantic outcome in their favor. George Burns and Gracie Allen are comedy legends. They're not known for their feature films, but they really sparkle in this one as Astaire's sidekicks. Their comedy bits are golden and they even join Fred for some dancing. The rest of the supporting cast is great, particularly Reginald Gardiner and Montagu Love. Joan Fontaine, very early in her career, is absolutely lovely. The music is from George and Ira Gershwin and is pretty good, if not as memorable as some of the music from the Astaire/Rogers flicks. I recognized "Nice Work If You Can Get It" and "A Foggy Day". There are a few wonderful dance sequences, including a wildly inventive fun house scene with Astaire, Burns, Allen, and a crowd of extras. There's also a tremendous solo routine where Astaire tap dances and plays a drum set-- with his feet. I caught this gem on TCM and I'm glad I did. I'm a huge Fred Astaire fan and this movie fits right in with his others. Plus it's got the added comedic bonus of George Burns and Gracie Allen. The movie is a lot of fun and it's got a nice little love story. It's time well spent if you're a classic movie fan. I just wish this forgotten treasure was more readily available.

    Enjoyable and frothy story of Americans Astaire, Burns, and Allen in England. Astaire falls for Joan Fontaine at first sight and vice versa. There follows confusion regarding his identity and intentions, leading her to reject, accept, reject, and accept Astaire in that order. I know -- it sounds familiar. The difference here is that Ginger Rogers is absent and there is no one to replace her. Joan Fontaine, at nineteen, had a pale, blond, virginal, winsome beauty that was dazzling, although make up overdid it and in some scenes, in close up, she looks a little debauched. She's a very appealing actress but not a dancer. She and Astaire have only one number together and her inadequacies are somewhat masked by foreground objects and camera placement. Her participation is mostly limited to hand-in-hand strolls and occasional spins. In another number, Astaire dances with Burns and Allen, two seasoned troupers, and if they aren't dancers either they march around and skip and do their steps with confidence and aplomb. Burns joked that his right leg did all the tapping while his left leg wanted to go into some other business. Astaire has two solos. One is a quick knockabout tap in the middle of a London street. The other, at the climax, sans the usual partner, is an exuberant tap-and-drum number to George and Ira Gershwin's "Nice Work If You Can Get It." It was George Gershwin's last score. He died of a brain tumor a few months before the film's release. It's not a memorable musical but rather a blithe romantic comedy that has a certain amusement quotient. And the numbers are nice. They include "A Foggy Day in London Town," sung but not danced by Astaire, that has become a standard. The plot probably has more substance than the Astaire/Rogers films but it's mainly a diverting and enjoyable trifle.

    One thing that you got a lot in the late 30s, when many of the franchises that had kept the industry going were now starting to lose appeal, was the studios putting together meaty packages of all the popular elements they had at their disposal in the hope of creating a sure-fire hit. 1937's Damsel in Distress gives us the dancing of Fred Astaire, the music of Gershwin, the writing of PG Wodehouse, plus a bevy of comedy supporting players. How could it fail? Well Fred Astaire's pairings with Ginger Rogers were beginning to lose money, and were perhaps being perceived as repetitive. Damsel in Distress seems to be an attempt to revive flagging box office takings by sending one half of the duo out on his own and putting him in a new environment with a new leading lady. While Joan Fontaine was a great actress, she was neither a singer nor a dancer, and what made the previous musicals work was the way Fred and Ginger clicked through dance  when their two characters danced together, you knew they were made for each other. You would later get the same thing when Astaire was teamed with Cyd Charisse. You're not going to get it with Fontaine. And it's not just Ginger who's missing; it seems to have been RKO's deliberate intention to remove all the familiar faces from the supporting cast  no Eric Blore, no Erik Rhodes and not even Edward Everett-Horton. Those jokers were half the fun! Instead, we get "cockney" lad Harry Watson, who presumably grew up to become Dick van Dyke's dialogue coach, and comedy couple George Burns and Gracie Allen, who are about as funny as cancer. Of course the Gershwins were always good, and Damsel in Distress contains some of their best songs. The choreography of Hermes Pan plays nicely off the lively tunes as well. However, like most musicals of the period, the song and dance numbers are simply showpieces for which the narrative must take a break. The Fun House routine, for which the picture won its only Oscar, is very amusing, although it shows how Hermes Pan was now more interested in props and elaboration than showcasing the talent of Fred. The simple flow of "Things are Looking Up" is actually more satisfying and sits better with the rest of the picture. Director George Stevens was someone who could always be relied upon to treat even the silliest of stories with grace and tenderness. The slow, measured pace he encourages from his actors, often with long moments between the dialogue in which the characters emote wordlessly, give great weight to the romantic scenes. The best "Stevens" moment from Damsel in Distress has to be when Fontaine confesses her feelings to Astaire at the cottage. As in many such scenes, we gradually move in from mid-shot to close-up, but Stevens begins that first close-up of Fontaine with her face moving into the frame, giving the moment that little bit more intensity. The steady pace of a George Stevens picture also often brought out the best in the comedy, although unfortunately there is not enough raw material here. As for poor old PG Wodehouse, you can just about see traces of his style, the basic plot being a typical Wodehouse blend of warm romance and gentle satire with an emphasis on the interplay between aristocrats and their servants. Someone probably thought this would go well with sassy sophistication and stuffy vs. modern dynamic of Astaire's musical comedies, but it clashes horribly. Few of the cast, with the exception of Reginald Gardiner and Montagu Love, look like they belong here. Incidentally the aforementioned Messrs. Blore, Rhodes and Everett-Horton would all fit very nicely into Wodehouse world. The trouble then with Damsel in Distress is that it throws together all its (mostly) worthy elements without any consideration of how they might work together. Bits and pieces of it are nice, and the songs are excellent, but overall it's a rather bland affair. The picture was predictably a great mistake that did no favours for Astaire's falling star, or Fontaine's rising one.

    Joan Fontaine is "A Damsel in Distress" in this 1937 musical starring Fred Astaire, George Burns, and Gracie Allen. The plot, what there is of it, is about a British woman (Fontaine) in love with an American, who is mistaken for Astaire, a musical comedy star. The film, directed by George Stevens, contains some wonderful Gershwin music, including "Nice Work if You Can Get It" and "A Foggy Day." The best scene is the "Stiff Upper Lip" number, which takes place in a fun house. Astaire's singing voice sounds more robust in this film than it does in others, and he has a couple of excellent dance numbers. Burns plays his over the top publicist and Allen is Burns' secretary. She's hilarious. The problem, as others have pointed out, is Fontaine, who has to dance with Astaire at the end of the film. Stevens could easily have used a double because he shows the dance in a long shot, and it takes place among the trees. I would have thought it was a double except the dancing was so lousy. Definitely worth seeing despite its flaws.

    "A Damsel in Distress" is definitely not one of Fred Astaire's better musicals. But even Astaire's bad films always had some good moments. In "Damsel," Astaire is Jerry Halliday, an American musical star who is in London on a personal appearance tour. He meets Lady Alice Marshmorton (19-year-old Joan Fontaine), a beautiful English heiress, who hops into the back of a cab he is taking to escape a mob of admirers. Jerry believes that Alice is being forced into a marriage by her rich aunt. He tries to rescue her from her family's country manor house, but soon discovers that the house staff is laying bets on which suitor Lady Alice will marry. Keggs (Reginald Gardiner) the conniving butler, and Albert (Harry Watson), the bratty house boy, each take turns alternately helping and sabotaging Lady Alice's romance with Jerry to make sure they win the bet. This musical has numerous problems. First, there is the plot, based on a novel by P.G. Wodehouse (who co-wrote the screenplay). The story is slow, painful, and nerve-grating. When Fred is not dancing, we have to endure endless annoying scenes of (a) Fred romancing Joan Fontaine or (b) Keggs and Albert conniving against them and each other. The butler and the house boy are especially irritating. They are one-dimensional stock villain characters, the kind of guys you just want to punch in the mouth. You wish they would get off the screen and let Fred dance. Astaire suffers in the absence of his usual partner, Ginger Rogers. Joan Fontaine is a lackluster leading lady in this film, and is miscast in a musical. She has little going for her, character-wise, other than her lovely face and beautiful smile. George Burns and Gracie Allen are along for the ride, as Jerry's publicist and his ditzy secretary. The duo adds some sorely needed chemistry to the plot, and Gracie has some funny lines, but she is also very annoying at times. The direction of the movie by George Stevens is not well done. At times, the cinematography is horrible and off-focus. There are a number of outdoor scenes set on extremely foggy streets, to try to convince the audience that we are in London, not Hollywood. (They must have used tons of dry ice in this movie.) On the plus side, the songs by George and Ira Gershwin are terrific, and have become classic song standards. And of course, the dancing in the movie is exceptional, thanks to Astaire and his choreographer, Hermes Pan. But the musical and dance numbers are ill-used and ill-staged. At times, the cast seems to start singing and dancing because, well, it's time for them to start singing and dancing. The musical numbers seem randomly inserted into the meandering plot. (At one point, the butler steps outside the manor house and breaks into an operetta solo for no clear reason.) The numbers include:  "I'm Dancing and I Can't Be Bothered Now" -- Fred dances well on a foggy traffic-filled London street. He does some great "cane-twirling" with a rolled umbrella -- but the number ends too soon when Fred jumps on a passing double-decker bus. (In the Broadway musical, "Crazy For You," Harry Groener did a much better version of this number with a group of chorus girls.)  "Put Me To The Test" -- Fred, George, and Gracie do a trio tap dance in an English cottage. George and Gracie match Fred step for step, but the number ends poorly with everyone kicking each other for no reason.  "Stiff Upper Lip" (The Fun House Number) -- At an amusement park fun house, Fred, George, and Gracie have fun dancing on the revolving floor, rotating barrel, and with the fun house mirrors. It's the best number of the movie, but it gets a little repetitious at times.  "Things Are Looking Up" -- Fred and Joan Fontaine do their one dance number together in the film, prancing around the back woods of the country manor estate. Fortunately, it's a very simple dance number because Joan is not a great dancer.  "A Foggy Day in London Town" -- Fred wanders around the foggy manor estate at night, crooning about the foggy day when he first met Joan in London. At times, he looks as if he's not sure which way he's going in the fog -- much like the musical number itself.  "Nice Work If You Can Get It" -- A great song that is misused in the movie. During a social event at the manor house, Fred gets drawn into a chorus of dour-faced singers who are haphazardly singing this song. Each time Fred joins in, the other singers look at him as if they wish he would leave. (Again, Harry Groener did a better dance number with this song in "Crazy For You.")  "Drum Dance Number" -- As Fred and Joan are eloping, Fred has to stop and do one final tap dance number while banging a group of drums. As usual, it's a great dance number. But there's absolutely no need for it, except to prolong the movie. The most contrived moment in the film comes when Fred decides to leap off a high stone balcony at the country estate in order to prove his love for Joan Fontaine. As he leaps from the balcony, he finds a conveniently-placed trapeze -- that's right, a *trapeze* -- hanging from a nearby tree. Fred (or rather, a stuntman in Fred's clothes) grabs the trapeze and swings to the ground from it. The movie is worth owning on DVD for the dance numbers alone, but you feel indebted to the guy who invented the Fast Forward button on your remote. The >>FF button allows you to skip through the other, boring scenes in the film to get to the dance numbers.

    There's a perfectly good reason why Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers made nine films together between 1933 and 1939  the pairing worked! Astaire's toe-tappin' class was complemented perfectly by the light-hearted comedic charms of his female co-star, and that he and Rogers never overshadowed each other was crucial to the success of their collaborations. 'A Damsel in Distress (1937)' sees Astaire, for the first time since his debut, momentarily set adrift from this celebrated partnership. It's a pleasant and enjoyable musical comedy, but it doesn't entirely work because Fred is clearly the main attraction, creating an imbalance of tone that feels somehow unsatisfying. Joan Fontaine, in an early role, fills in as the primary romantic interest; she's not particularly convincing here  but, geez, she's gorgeous!  and her charms would carry her along sufficiently until her superb star-making performance in Alfred Hitchcock's 'Rebecca (1940).' Husband-and-wife vaudeville duo George Burns and Gracie Allen provide most of the welcome comic relief, which is basically an extension of their popular stage act. 'A Damsel in Distress' was directed by George Stevens {who had previously worked with Astaire in 'Swing Time (1936)} and adapted by P.G. Wodehouse from his own 1919 novel. Jerry Halliday (Astaire) is a famous American dancer, frustrated by all his publicity, who falls in love with the beautiful Lady Alyce Marshmorton (Fontaine), whom he believes has inexplicably fallen in love with him. What Jerry doesn't realise is that Lady Alyce has actually fallen in love with a different (unseen) American, and that he is being misled by the staff at Tottney Castle, who have placed bets on who their mistress will eventually marry. Reginald Gardiner hilariously hams it up as Keggs, the scheming butler who apparently can't resist belting out an opera when the appropriate music starts playing. Burns and Allen provide the necessary supporting back-up (even matching Astaire step-for-step in the "Fun House" musical number), with the latter playing the ditsy eccentric with perfect composure, utilising more cringeworthy puns than Groucho Marx in 'Duck Soup (1933).' George Gershwin played a significant role in getting Stevens' film made in the first place, and his songs were completed before script-work actually began. Tragically, the composer died from a brain tumour before production was completed. There were not quite as many musical numbers as I had expected, and very few stood out in my memory like Astaire's greatest tunes. Nevertheless, the "Fun House" number was an elaborate, precisely-orchestrated dance sequence, making superb use of reflections, moving sets and confined spaces. Most memorable of all was Astaire's rendition of "A Foggy Day (In London Town)," performed as the actor traipses gracefully through a fog-ridden forest. Joan Fontaine was the first actress to admit her insufficient capacity to play a convincing terpsichorean, and so she only attempts it once, and, all things considered, she doesn't embarrass herself all that much. She is, of course, always a joy to watch, but her character's "I love you now I hate you no, wait, I love you again" routine is overdone and unpersuasive.
