    Let me start off by saying that I never watched any episode of Star Trek before I saw this. Up until recently, the Star Trek franchise in general was like a foreign language to me, and I knew just about nothing about it. When Star Trek: Into Darkness was coming out, I decided to give this movie a watch, since the time felt right for me to do so. And 2 hours and 20 minutes later, I was a Star Trek fan. Now granted, this is not a perfect movie by any means. A lot of the effects shots can drag out for quite a while, and some things can even get confusing as a result of that. But I was able to get past that, and I was rewarded with a satisfying Star Trek experience as a result. The plot was compelling and interesting, and it felt right for something with the Star Trek name on it. The characters took a while to get used to for me, but by the end I knew who they all were. The special effects, though very slow moving and primitive by today's standards, still look good for their time. I know it was trying to be like 2001: A Space Odyssey, but even so, some of the effects shots that tried to mimic that still look good now. (And no, I didn't see the enhanced director's cut, I saw the original version). I think that my favorite aspect of Star Trek: The Motion Picture though, is the philosophies that is was conveying. I think Spock said it best when he said, "Logic is never alone", implying that there is a God, and he plays a part in everything that involves the unexplained. I never expected to find such elements to a Star Trek film, and there are others around the movie as well. One other one involves the never ending search for knowledge, and plenty of others that I can't remember at the moment. So as a whole, Star Trek: The Motion Picture, while being a slow paced and sometimes dragging film, is still a good work of art. It was an interesting introduction to the Star Trek franchise, and as of now I still like it. I recommend it to anyone who likes Star Trek, or to anyone who want to get into Stat Trek. On the other hand, I still love Star Wars better. 8/10.

    Recently I browsed in my archive for good documentary on sci-fi cinema. Of course opinions vary but "Star Trek: The Movie" (1979) offers a good example for the Director's Cut and its bonuses. The movie is landmark in space cinema and although it came two years later than "Star Wars" (1977) it still counted first because of the longest pre-production period. It also involved controversies with director Robert Wise (19142005) and producer Gene Roddenberry (19211991) who are idiosyncratic names for cinema and sci-fi literature, respectfully. The bonus material on DVD is interesting as to the fact that we see something of Robert Wise on rare footage. The latter is quite worn out from age but have mind as a razor. He reminds very much of his friend and colleague Ray Harryhausen (19202013) - acknowledged guru of special effects cinema - in the latest years of his life when he divulges secrets of his craftsmanship and communicates with his followers students (i.e. George Lucas of "Star Wars" is one of them). Add here George Pal (19081980) and Stanley Kubrick (19281999) and you could have a full staff for sci-fi cinema history, ditto. As for Gene Roddenberry the story stays a bit different. I have in my archive more books about him than video footage. Apparently he didn't appear very much in front of the camera or maybe I am mistaken. On the bonus disk his widow Majel Barrett narrates very extensively how they bargain very hard to rip-off the Movie from TV. Gene was as much manager as a scripter and a producer. He was also a former policeman and founding member of World Sci-fi Association. Ray Bradbury, Isaac Asimov and many other celebrity writers were his personal friends. Whoopi Goldberg made her film debut on his recommendation. Thank you.

    The first cinema outing for the franchise has none of the strong characterisation or sense of adventure present in the TV series; it's as if the makers thought that the move to the big screen meant they'd better play it all po-faced, and in the process the atmosphere has been lost. Returning regulars William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley et al have little to besides react to what's going on around them, the writers instead preferring to concentrate on new characters who make no impression, such as Stephen Collins's flavourless captain. The movie was developed from the ashes of a proposed revival of the TV series, but after three episodes of these guys you'd have turned over to 'Space: 1999'. Developments late in the plot are thoughtful but entirely without impact and are never interesting enough to warrant the interminable build up. Virtually nothing happens through the middle and the pace is sometimes agonisingly slow (the Enterprise docking sequence, for example), director Robert Wise making almost every shot twice as long as it needs to be. The production design, too, is slick and fresh but completely without character. This is a disappointing and lifeless film. It wants to be '2001' but, well, see above.

    I say you will either love this or hate it because I personally loved it, but I could see why a lot of people say what they do about this film. I grew up with this movie. I was 5 when it came out and it's in my earliest memories of watching it on the Sunday Night Movie. I've watched the quality of it progress as media technology has progressed. People say it's too long and I might agree with that. The scenes entering the cloud could have been cut down, but I think the director tried his best at creating an epic storyline and almost pulled it off. The movie isn't action packed but it's intelligent. They managed to take Star Trek in directions they hadn't or couldn't in the TV show. Panning over the ship for a full instrumental sequence was long winded but it was the first time anyone had seen the ship up close for the first time and in that context it has to be appreciated. The story took the time to answer simple questions a lot of people had pondered like "what would it be like if the transporter malfunctioned" and "what if the warp drive malfunctioned mid-warp". The twist at the end was brilliant, in my opinion. It was a slower movie, but I still feel it kept a steady pace. People say it was too serious, but there's quite a few little jokes along the way. The music in it is top notch. The movie was made during a time when musical scores where just as much of a character in a movie as the rest of the cast. This movie is no exception. The federation theme music was good enough for The Next Generation to use it for the show's theme music. It does a great job of creating mood as well as greatly enhancing the atmosphere of all the important scenes. I guess to sum it up, I wouldn't use this movie to introduce someone to Star Trek. I would however try and put myself in the place of someone who had jumped on the series bandwagon way back when and was finally experiencing the long awaited movie for the first time in the theater on opening day! That excitement and nostalgia blended together must have been amazing and trying to capture that while watching the movie would greatly enhance the experience of someone who successfully accomplishes it. I gave it a 9 and not a 10 because it does have some sketchy editing in a couple places where there could have been better continuity. Other than that I think it's a solid film and anyone who's a Star Trek fan should try and appreciate what the intentions of the movie were and not pit it against other blockbuster movies, especially one's from today's star date!

    This gets 7/10 from me, even if I don't rewatch it all that often (ST4 is the one I've watched most times I think). I would watch it more often but I know few people who like it that much. Apart from finally seeing NGC-1701 on the big screen, there's a lot to like here. Thought-provoking SF (rare on film), not exciting but interesting, and conflicts solved in an intelligent manner by thinking characters. The slow approach to the Enterprise will probably bore general audiences to tears nowadays; I find it not a second too long. The SFX inside V'ger have a dreamlike quality not unlike those at the end of 2001, and the V'ger set itself has an otherworldly, yet simple, look that's sorely missing from many of today's SF which always tries to go for gritty/realistic.

    Star Trek: The Motion Picture **1/2 (out of 4) 132 mins/ U Cast: William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan Director: Robert Wise Plot: When a mysterious object is found to be approaching Earth at rapid speeds, Captain Kirk and his crew set out to prevent it doing so. JJ's Verdict: Featuring the entire original Star Trek cast from the television series, 'The Motion Picture' was only made after the success of 70's sci-fi films like Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The plot is very simple and was made that way so new fans could become interested in the series. The film focuses on the crew trying to intercept V-GER, a mysterious object fast approaching Earth. Tensions rise as the crew argue about what to do and how to stop the object from destroying mankind. Despite this, the dialogue continually makes references to out of space objects and rituals, which, to someone completely foreign to the Star Trek Universe, left me bewildered. The film has other problems as well. The visual effects, while alright, aren't good enough to seem realistic and for you to take the film seriously. The acting is good enough with William Shatner leading the way in terms of any sign of emotion and while the ending is actually very exciting and surprisingly interesting, 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' is nothing more than a decent sci-fi film.

    I want to start by saying this movie makes me feel conflicted. I love all the characters, but the movie moves so slow. It was most people call it a motionless picture. It is very slow plot wise and doesn't give me that pizazz like other Trek films. I wish to say I could love this film because I wanted to after loving this characters, but i couldn't. I gave it a 6 when I would rather give it a 6.5 because I think that is what it is. The plot also fell a little flat for me and the ending just didn't do it for me. This film was made after Star Wars so it created even more hate when it shouldn't. If this film was made before Star Wars, I would think that it would probably be rated closer to 7 than 6. I have to give it credit for keeping this franchise alive so it could spawn 5 sequels, then a few television shows one of which spawned four films and was rebooted in 2009 with 2 films already. All in all it doesn't deserve all of the crap it gets, but some of it is justifiable.

    This is the first Star Trek film after the hit TV series, and the film is overall a bust. The film has some very pointless scenes that take way too long and the story is rather boring as when you finally get to it, you kind of gave up on the movie. The movie takes about 40 minutes to get started and this involves assembling the old gang back together which was nice to see them again, but one of the first pointless scenes was when Kirk is heading to the Enterprise in a shuttle. The scene takes forever and is not well done. After it gets rolling, the last 50 minutes or so are decent for being an episode on television, but not on the big screen. The cast was still lovable and lost none of their charms after being absent for a while but this movie had so many possible ways to go and it took the wrong path for most of the film. The film looked nice which is a bonus as we did get to most of the system and it looked neat, but some of the scenes are overdone with camera work and takes a long time for us to soak things in and/or get impatient. I love the idea of bringing it to the big screen, but I wish they made better decisions. Me: 3/5 Audience: 3.15/5

    Star Trek: The Motion Picture is a good movie with a storyline that gets a bit carried away with itself,but a strong cast and brilliant characters still make this movie watchable.I am not a huge fan of Star Trek,but every time I watch it I enjoy it,and I do understand why this movie would disappoint a lot of the die hard Star Trek fans,probably the most loyal fans on the planet.I found the story and some of the dialogue stupid at times,but I still enjoyed this movie because William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy still manage to deliver great performances as Captain Kirk and Spock.Trekkies will definitely be disappointed with their first big screen adventure and should probably just watch three episodes in a row instead,but I do feel people who enjoy sci-fi that aren't die hard fans could enjoy Star Trek: The Motion Picture a lot more. Captain Kirk leads the Starship Enterprise to put a stop to an entity on its way to Earth to find its creator.

    They really don't make them like this any more. Couldn't. Imagine if Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman had walked into the Paramount offices and slammed THIS script on the table: A slow, solemn, philosophically dense adventure into a cloud of gas, with barely an action scene in sight and no conventional enemy. Almost a decade previously, Robert Wise directed The Andromeda Strain, the quintessential "hard" sci-fi of the 1970s, where the emphasis was on the science, and the action took place on computer readouts. And two decades before that he made The Day the Earth Stood Still, a 1950s monster movie without a monster, standing out at the time for its seriousness. Star Trek The Motion Picture could be seen as Wise's homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey. There are lengthy sequences (I'm talking 10 minutes at a time) basically constituted of extended fly-bys of Douglas Trumbull's still-extraordinary special effects. Throughout, there's an admirable dedication to awe, something often missing from modern sci-fi, where a black hole is no more than a flying mouth and spacetime is traversed in a shrug. If only there'd been equivalent care shown to the characters. Unfortunately, they are reduced to mere tour guides on this fantastic adventure, showing us when to gaze agape in wonderment, and verbalising what is frankly apparent from the images. The ending is like the birth of the Starchild with a director's commentary rambling over the top. Kirk (William Shatner, subtle in portraying the humility of his out-of-practice captain) and Spock (the monolithic Leonard Nimoy) are present, and the friendship is as tender and fraught as ever - but they have only one really good scene together. Instead, the focus is on the star-cross'd relationship between the Deltan Ilia (a chilling Persis Khambatta) and acting-captain Decker (Stephen Collins), which is sadly rather drab and unconvincing. The Motion Picture may not be the finest film in the original Star Trek series, but it's certainly the most distinctive and the strangest - a far, far cry from Star Trek IV's terrestrial comedy. What it lacks in humour and emotional resonance, The Motion Picture makes up for with its grand scope and vision, sometimes sparking the senses and stirring the imagination.

The acting is good enough with William Shatner leading the way in terms of any sign of emotion and while the ending is actually very exciting and surprisingly interesting, 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' is nothing more than a decent sci-fi film.

    I want to start by saying this movie makes me feel conflicted. I love all the characters, but the movie moves so slow. It was most people call it a motionless picture. It is very slow plot wise and doesn't give me that pizazz like other Trek films. I wish to say I could love this film because I wanted to after loving this characters, but i couldn't. I gave it a 6 when I would rather give it a 6.5 because I think that is what it is. The plot also fell a little flat for me and the ending just didn't do it for me. This film was made after Star Wars so it created even more hate when it shouldn't. If this film was made before Star Wars, I would think that it would probably be rated closer to 7 than 6. I have to give it credit for keeping this franchise alive so it could spawn 5 sequels, then a few television shows one of which spawned four films and was rebooted in 2009 with 2 films already. All in all it doesn't deserve all of the crap it gets, but some of it is justifiable.

    This is the first Star Trek film after the hit TV series, and the film is overall a bust. The film has some very pointless scenes that take way too long and the story is rather boring as when you finally get to it, you kind of gave up on the movie. The movie takes about 40 minutes to get started and this involves assembling the old gang back together which was nice to see them again, but one of the first pointless scenes was when Kirk is heading to the Enterprise in a shuttle. The scene takes forever and is not well done. After it gets rolling, the last 50 minutes or so are decent for being an episode on television, but not on the big screen. The cast was still lovable and lost none of their charms after being absent for a while but this movie had so many possible ways to go and it took the wrong path for most of the film. The film looked nice which is a bonus as we did get to most of the system and it looked neat, but some of the scenes are overdone with camera work and takes a long time for us to soak things in and/or get impatient. I love the idea of bringing it to the big screen, but I wish they made better decisions. Me: 3/5 Audience: 3.15/5

    Star Trek: The Motion Picture is a good movie with a storyline that gets a bit carried away with itself,but a strong cast and brilliant characters still make this movie watchable.I am not a huge fan of Star Trek,but every time I watch it I enjoy it,and I do understand why this movie would disappoint a lot of the die hard Star Trek fans,probably the most loyal fans on the planet.I found the story and some of the dialogue stupid at times,but I still enjoyed this movie because William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy still manage to deliver great performances as Captain Kirk and Spock.Trekkies will definitely be disappointed with their first big screen adventure and should probably just watch three episodes in a row instead,but I do feel people who enjoy sci-fi that aren't die hard fans could enjoy Star Trek: The Motion Picture a lot more. Captain Kirk leads the Starship Enterprise to put a stop to an entity on its way to Earth to find its creator.

    They really don't make them like this any more. Couldn't. Imagine if Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman had walked into the Paramount offices and slammed THIS script on the table: A slow, solemn, philosophically dense adventure into a cloud of gas, with barely an action scene in sight and no conventional enemy. Almost a decade previously, Robert Wise directed The Andromeda Strain, the quintessential "hard" sci-fi of the 1970s, where the emphasis was on the science, and the action took place on computer readouts. And two decades before that he made The Day the Earth Stood Still, a 1950s monster movie without a monster, standing out at the time for its seriousness. Star Trek The Motion Picture could be seen as Wise's homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey. There are lengthy sequences (I'm talking 10 minutes at a time) basically constituted of extended fly-bys of Douglas Trumbull's still-extraordinary special effects. Throughout, there's an admirable dedication to awe, something often missing from modern sci-fi, where a black hole is no more than a flying mouth and spacetime is traversed in a shrug. If only there'd been equivalent care shown to the characters. Unfortunately, they are reduced to mere tour guides on this fantastic adventure, showing us when to gaze agape in wonderment, and verbalising what is frankly apparent from the images. The ending is like the birth of the Starchild with a director's commentary rambling over the top. Kirk (William Shatner, subtle in portraying the humility of his out-of-practice captain) and Spock (the monolithic Leonard Nimoy) are present, and the friendship is as tender and fraught as ever - but they have only one really good scene together. Instead, the focus is on the star-cross'd relationship between the Deltan Ilia (a chilling Persis Khambatta) and acting-captain Decker (Stephen Collins), which is sadly rather drab and unconvincing. The Motion Picture may not be the finest film in the original Star Trek series, but it's certainly the most distinctive and the strangest - a far, far cry from Star Trek IV's terrestrial comedy. What it lacks in humour and emotional resonance, The Motion Picture makes up for with its grand scope and vision, sometimes sparking the senses and stirring the imagination.

    Let me start off by saying that I never watched any episode of Star Trek before I saw this. Up until recently, the Star Trek franchise in general was like a foreign language to me, and I knew just about nothing about it. When Star Trek: Into Darkness was coming out, I decided to give this movie a watch, since the time felt right for me to do so. And 2 hours and 20 minutes later, I was a Star Trek fan. Now granted, this is not a perfect movie by any means. A lot of the effects shots can drag out for quite a while, and some things can even get confusing as a result of that. But I was able to get past that, and I was rewarded with a satisfying Star Trek experience as a result. The plot was compelling and interesting, and it felt right for something with the Star Trek name on it. The characters took a while to get used to for me, but by the end I knew who they all were. The special effects, though very slow moving and primitive by today's standards, still look good for their time. I know it was trying to be like 2001: A Space Odyssey, but even so, some of the effects shots that tried to mimic that still look good now. (And no, I didn't see the enhanced director's cut, I saw the original version). I think that my favorite aspect of Star Trek: The Motion Picture though, is the philosophies that is was conveying. I think Spock said it best when he said, "Logic is never alone", implying that there is a God, and he plays a part in everything that involves the unexplained. I never expected to find such elements to a Star Trek film, and there are others around the movie as well. One other one involves the never ending search for knowledge, and plenty of others that I can't remember at the moment. So as a whole, Star Trek: The Motion Picture, while being a slow paced and sometimes dragging film, is still a good work of art. It was an interesting introduction to the Star Trek franchise, and as of now I still like it. I recommend it to anyone who likes Star Trek, or to anyone who want to get into Stat Trek. On the other hand, I still love Star Wars better. 8/10.

    Recently I browsed in my archive for good documentary on sci-fi cinema. Of course opinions vary but "Star Trek: The Movie" (1979) offers a good example for the Director's Cut and its bonuses. The movie is landmark in space cinema and although it came two years later than "Star Wars" (1977) it still counted first because of the longest pre-production period. It also involved controversies with director Robert Wise (19142005) and producer Gene Roddenberry (19211991) who are idiosyncratic names for cinema and sci-fi literature, respectfully. The bonus material on DVD is interesting as to the fact that we see something of Robert Wise on rare footage. The latter is quite worn out from age but have mind as a razor. He reminds very much of his friend and colleague Ray Harryhausen (19202013) - acknowledged guru of special effects cinema - in the latest years of his life when he divulges secrets of his craftsmanship and communicates with his followers students (i.e. George Lucas of "Star Wars" is one of them). Add here George Pal (19081980) and Stanley Kubrick (19281999) and you could have a full staff for sci-fi cinema history, ditto. As for Gene Roddenberry the story stays a bit different. I have in my archive more books about him than video footage. Apparently he didn't appear very much in front of the camera or maybe I am mistaken. On the bonus disk his widow Majel Barrett narrates very extensively how they bargain very hard to rip-off the Movie from TV. Gene was as much manager as a scripter and a producer. He was also a former policeman and founding member of World Sci-fi Association. Ray Bradbury, Isaac Asimov and many other celebrity writers were his personal friends. Whoopi Goldberg made her film debut on his recommendation. Thank you.

    The first cinema outing for the franchise has none of the strong characterisation or sense of adventure present in the TV series; it's as if the makers thought that the move to the big screen meant they'd better play it all po-faced, and in the process the atmosphere has been lost. Returning regulars William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley et al have little to besides react to what's going on around them, the writers instead preferring to concentrate on new characters who make no impression, such as Stephen Collins's flavourless captain. The movie was developed from the ashes of a proposed revival of the TV series, but after three episodes of these guys you'd have turned over to 'Space: 1999'. Developments late in the plot are thoughtful but entirely without impact and are never interesting enough to warrant the interminable build up. Virtually nothing happens through the middle and the pace is sometimes agonisingly slow (the Enterprise docking sequence, for example), director Robert Wise making almost every shot twice as long as it needs to be. The production design, too, is slick and fresh but completely without character. This is a disappointing and lifeless film. It wants to be '2001' but, well, see above.

    I say you will either love this or hate it because I personally loved it, but I could see why a lot of people say what they do about this film. I grew up with this movie. I was 5 when it came out and it's in my earliest memories of watching it on the Sunday Night Movie. I've watched the quality of it progress as media technology has progressed. People say it's too long and I might agree with that. The scenes entering the cloud could have been cut down, but I think the director tried his best at creating an epic storyline and almost pulled it off. The movie isn't action packed but it's intelligent. They managed to take Star Trek in directions they hadn't or couldn't in the TV show. Panning over the ship for a full instrumental sequence was long winded but it was the first time anyone had seen the ship up close for the first time and in that context it has to be appreciated. The story took the time to answer simple questions a lot of people had pondered like "what would it be like if the transporter malfunctioned" and "what if the warp drive malfunctioned mid-warp". The twist at the end was brilliant, in my opinion. It was a slower movie, but I still feel it kept a steady pace. People say it was too serious, but there's quite a few little jokes along the way. The music in it is top notch. The movie was made during a time when musical scores where just as much of a character in a movie as the rest of the cast. This movie is no exception. The federation theme music was good enough for The Next Generation to use it for the show's theme music. It does a great job of creating mood as well as greatly enhancing the atmosphere of all the important scenes. I guess to sum it up, I wouldn't use this movie to introduce someone to Star Trek. I would however try and put myself in the place of someone who had jumped on the series bandwagon way back when and was finally experiencing the long awaited movie for the first time in the theater on opening day! That excitement and nostalgia blended together must have been amazing and trying to capture that while watching the movie would greatly enhance the experience of someone who successfully accomplishes it. I gave it a 9 and not a 10 because it does have some sketchy editing in a couple places where there could have been better continuity. Other than that I think it's a solid film and anyone who's a Star Trek fan should try and appreciate what the intentions of the movie were and not pit it against other blockbuster movies, especially one's from today's star date!

    This gets 7/10 from me, even if I don't rewatch it all that often (ST4 is the one I've watched most times I think). I would watch it more often but I know few people who like it that much. Apart from finally seeing NGC-1701 on the big screen, there's a lot to like here. Thought-provoking SF (rare on film), not exciting but interesting, and conflicts solved in an intelligent manner by thinking characters. The slow approach to the Enterprise will probably bore general audiences to tears nowadays; I find it not a second too long. The SFX inside V'ger have a dreamlike quality not unlike those at the end of 2001, and the V'ger set itself has an otherworldly, yet simple, look that's sorely missing from many of today's SF which always tries to go for gritty/realistic.

    Star Trek: The Motion Picture **1/2 (out of 4) 132 mins/ U Cast: William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan Director: Robert Wise Plot: When a mysterious object is found to be approaching Earth at rapid speeds, Captain Kirk and his crew set out to prevent it doing so. JJ's Verdict: Featuring the entire original Star Trek cast from the television series, 'The Motion Picture' was only made after the success of 70's sci-fi films like Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The plot is very simple and was made that way so new fans could become interested in the series. The film focuses on the crew trying to intercept V-GER, a mysterious object fast approaching Earth. Tensions rise as the crew argue about what to do and how to stop the object from destroying mankind. Despite this, the dialogue continually makes references to out of space objects and rituals, which, to someone completely foreign to the Star Trek Universe, left me bewildered. The film has other problems as well. The visual effects, while alright, aren't good enough to seem realistic and for you to take the film seriously. The acting is good enough with William Shatner leading the way in terms of any sign of emotion and while the ending is actually very exciting and surprisingly interesting, 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' is nothing more than a decent sci-fi film.

I was 5 when it came out and it's in my earliest memories of watching it on the Sunday Night Movie. I've watched the quality of it progress as media technology has progressed. People say it's too long and I might agree with that. The scenes entering the cloud could have been cut down, but I think the director tried his best at creating an epic storyline and almost pulled it off. The movie isn't action packed but it's intelligent. They managed to take Star Trek in directions they hadn't or couldn't in the TV show. Panning over the ship for a full instrumental sequence was long winded but it was the first time anyone had seen the ship up close for the first time and in that context it has to be appreciated. The story took the time to answer simple questions a lot of people had pondered like "what would it be like if the transporter malfunctioned" and "what if the warp drive malfunctioned mid-warp". The twist at the end was brilliant, in my opinion. It was a slower movie, but I still feel it kept a steady pace. People say it was too serious, but there's quite a few little jokes along the way. The music in it is top notch. The movie was made during a time when musical scores where just as much of a character in a movie as the rest of the cast. This movie is no exception. The federation theme music was good enough for The Next Generation to use it for the show's theme music. It does a great job of creating mood as well as greatly enhancing the atmosphere of all the important scenes. I guess to sum it up, I wouldn't use this movie to introduce someone to Star Trek. I would however try and put myself in the place of someone who had jumped on the series bandwagon way back when and was finally experiencing the long awaited movie for the first time in the theater on opening day! That excitement and nostalgia blended together must have been amazing and trying to capture that while watching the movie would greatly enhance the experience of someone who successfully accomplishes it. I gave it a 9 and not a 10 because it does have some sketchy editing in a couple places where there could have been better continuity. Other than that I think it's a solid film and anyone who's a Star Trek fan should try and appreciate what the intentions of the movie were and not pit it against other blockbuster movies, especially one's from today's star date!

    This gets 7/10 from me, even if I don't rewatch it all that often (ST4 is the one I've watched most times I think). I would watch it more often but I know few people who like it that much. Apart from finally seeing NGC-1701 on the big screen, there's a lot to like here. Thought-provoking SF (rare on film), not exciting but interesting, and conflicts solved in an intelligent manner by thinking characters. The slow approach to the Enterprise will probably bore general audiences to tears nowadays; I find it not a second too long. The SFX inside V'ger have a dreamlike quality not unlike those at the end of 2001, and the V'ger set itself has an otherworldly, yet simple, look that's sorely missing from many of today's SF which always tries to go for gritty/realistic.

    Star Trek: The Motion Picture **1/2 (out of 4) 132 mins/ U Cast: William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan Director: Robert Wise Plot: When a mysterious object is found to be approaching Earth at rapid speeds, Captain Kirk and his crew set out to prevent it doing so. JJ's Verdict: Featuring the entire original Star Trek cast from the television series, 'The Motion Picture' was only made after the success of 70's sci-fi films like Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The plot is very simple and was made that way so new fans could become interested in the series. The film focuses on the crew trying to intercept V-GER, a mysterious object fast approaching Earth. Tensions rise as the crew argue about what to do and how to stop the object from destroying mankind. Despite this, the dialogue continually makes references to out of space objects and rituals, which, to someone completely foreign to the Star Trek Universe, left me bewildered. The film has other problems as well. The visual effects, while alright, aren't good enough to seem realistic and for you to take the film seriously. The acting is good enough with William Shatner leading the way in terms of any sign of emotion and while the ending is actually very exciting and surprisingly interesting, 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' is nothing more than a decent sci-fi film.

    I want to start by saying this movie makes me feel conflicted. I love all the characters, but the movie moves so slow. It was most people call it a motionless picture. It is very slow plot wise and doesn't give me that pizazz like other Trek films. I wish to say I could love this film because I wanted to after loving this characters, but i couldn't. I gave it a 6 when I would rather give it a 6.5 because I think that is what it is. The plot also fell a little flat for me and the ending just didn't do it for me. This film was made after Star Wars so it created even more hate when it shouldn't. If this film was made before Star Wars, I would think that it would probably be rated closer to 7 than 6. I have to give it credit for keeping this franchise alive so it could spawn 5 sequels, then a few television shows one of which spawned four films and was rebooted in 2009 with 2 films already. All in all it doesn't deserve all of the crap it gets, but some of it is justifiable.

    This is the first Star Trek film after the hit TV series, and the film is overall a bust. The film has some very pointless scenes that take way too long and the story is rather boring as when you finally get to it, you kind of gave up on the movie. The movie takes about 40 minutes to get started and this involves assembling the old gang back together which was nice to see them again, but one of the first pointless scenes was when Kirk is heading to the Enterprise in a shuttle. The scene takes forever and is not well done. After it gets rolling, the last 50 minutes or so are decent for being an episode on television, but not on the big screen. The cast was still lovable and lost none of their charms after being absent for a while but this movie had so many possible ways to go and it took the wrong path for most of the film. The film looked nice which is a bonus as we did get to most of the system and it looked neat, but some of the scenes are overdone with camera work and takes a long time for us to soak things in and/or get impatient. I love the idea of bringing it to the big screen, but I wish they made better decisions. Me: 3/5 Audience: 3.15/5

    Star Trek: The Motion Picture is a good movie with a storyline that gets a bit carried away with itself,but a strong cast and brilliant characters still make this movie watchable.I am not a huge fan of Star Trek,but every time I watch it I enjoy it,and I do understand why this movie would disappoint a lot of the die hard Star Trek fans,probably the most loyal fans on the planet.I found the story and some of the dialogue stupid at times,but I still enjoyed this movie because William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy still manage to deliver great performances as Captain Kirk and Spock.Trekkies will definitely be disappointed with their first big screen adventure and should probably just watch three episodes in a row instead,but I do feel people who enjoy sci-fi that aren't die hard fans could enjoy Star Trek: The Motion Picture a lot more. Captain Kirk leads the Starship Enterprise to put a stop to an entity on its way to Earth to find its creator.

    They really don't make them like this any more. Couldn't. Imagine if Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman had walked into the Paramount offices and slammed THIS script on the table: A slow, solemn, philosophically dense adventure into a cloud of gas, with barely an action scene in sight and no conventional enemy. Almost a decade previously, Robert Wise directed The Andromeda Strain, the quintessential "hard" sci-fi of the 1970s, where the emphasis was on the science, and the action took place on computer readouts. And two decades before that he made The Day the Earth Stood Still, a 1950s monster movie without a monster, standing out at the time for its seriousness. Star Trek The Motion Picture could be seen as Wise's homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey. There are lengthy sequences (I'm talking 10 minutes at a time) basically constituted of extended fly-bys of Douglas Trumbull's still-extraordinary special effects. Throughout, there's an admirable dedication to awe, something often missing from modern sci-fi, where a black hole is no more than a flying mouth and spacetime is traversed in a shrug. If only there'd been equivalent care shown to the characters. Unfortunately, they are reduced to mere tour guides on this fantastic adventure, showing us when to gaze agape in wonderment, and verbalising what is frankly apparent from the images. The ending is like the birth of the Starchild with a director's commentary rambling over the top. Kirk (William Shatner, subtle in portraying the humility of his out-of-practice captain) and Spock (the monolithic Leonard Nimoy) are present, and the friendship is as tender and fraught as ever - but they have only one really good scene together. Instead, the focus is on the star-cross'd relationship between the Deltan Ilia (a chilling Persis Khambatta) and acting-captain Decker (Stephen Collins), which is sadly rather drab and unconvincing. The Motion Picture may not be the finest film in the original Star Trek series, but it's certainly the most distinctive and the strangest - a far, far cry from Star Trek IV's terrestrial comedy. What it lacks in humour and emotional resonance, The Motion Picture makes up for with its grand scope and vision, sometimes sparking the senses and stirring the imagination.

    Let me start off by saying that I never watched any episode of Star Trek before I saw this. Up until recently, the Star Trek franchise in general was like a foreign language to me, and I knew just about nothing about it. When Star Trek: Into Darkness was coming out, I decided to give this movie a watch, since the time felt right for me to do so. And 2 hours and 20 minutes later, I was a Star Trek fan. Now granted, this is not a perfect movie by any means. A lot of the effects shots can drag out for quite a while, and some things can even get confusing as a result of that. But I was able to get past that, and I was rewarded with a satisfying Star Trek experience as a result. The plot was compelling and interesting, and it felt right for something with the Star Trek name on it. The characters took a while to get used to for me, but by the end I knew who they all were. The special effects, though very slow moving and primitive by today's standards, still look good for their time. I know it was trying to be like 2001: A Space Odyssey, but even so, some of the effects shots that tried to mimic that still look good now. (And no, I didn't see the enhanced director's cut, I saw the original version). I think that my favorite aspect of Star Trek: The Motion Picture though, is the philosophies that is was conveying. I think Spock said it best when he said, "Logic is never alone", implying that there is a God, and he plays a part in everything that involves the unexplained. I never expected to find such elements to a Star Trek film, and there are others around the movie as well. One other one involves the never ending search for knowledge, and plenty of others that I can't remember at the moment. So as a whole, Star Trek: The Motion Picture, while being a slow paced and sometimes dragging film, is still a good work of art. It was an interesting introduction to the Star Trek franchise, and as of now I still like it. I recommend it to anyone who likes Star Trek, or to anyone who want to get into Stat Trek. On the other hand, I still love Star Wars better. 8/10.

    Recently I browsed in my archive for good documentary on sci-fi cinema. Of course opinions vary but "Star Trek: The Movie" (1979) offers a good example for the Director's Cut and its bonuses. The movie is landmark in space cinema and although it came two years later than "Star Wars" (1977) it still counted first because of the longest pre-production period. It also involved controversies with director Robert Wise (19142005) and producer Gene Roddenberry (19211991) who are idiosyncratic names for cinema and sci-fi literature, respectfully. The bonus material on DVD is interesting as to the fact that we see something of Robert Wise on rare footage. The latter is quite worn out from age but have mind as a razor. He reminds very much of his friend and colleague Ray Harryhausen (19202013) - acknowledged guru of special effects cinema - in the latest years of his life when he divulges secrets of his craftsmanship and communicates with his followers students (i.e. George Lucas of "Star Wars" is one of them). Add here George Pal (19081980) and Stanley Kubrick (19281999) and you could have a full staff for sci-fi cinema history, ditto. As for Gene Roddenberry the story stays a bit different. I have in my archive more books about him than video footage. Apparently he didn't appear very much in front of the camera or maybe I am mistaken. On the bonus disk his widow Majel Barrett narrates very extensively how they bargain very hard to rip-off the Movie from TV. Gene was as much manager as a scripter and a producer. He was also a former policeman and founding member of World Sci-fi Association. Ray Bradbury, Isaac Asimov and many other celebrity writers were his personal friends. Whoopi Goldberg made her film debut on his recommendation. Thank you.

    The first cinema outing for the franchise has none of the strong characterisation or sense of adventure present in the TV series; it's as if the makers thought that the move to the big screen meant they'd better play it all po-faced, and in the process the atmosphere has been lost. Returning regulars William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley et al have little to besides react to what's going on around them, the writers instead preferring to concentrate on new characters who make no impression, such as Stephen Collins's flavourless captain. The movie was developed from the ashes of a proposed revival of the TV series, but after three episodes of these guys you'd have turned over to 'Space: 1999'. Developments late in the plot are thoughtful but entirely without impact and are never interesting enough to warrant the interminable build up. Virtually nothing happens through the middle and the pace is sometimes agonisingly slow (the Enterprise docking sequence, for example), director Robert Wise making almost every shot twice as long as it needs to be. The production design, too, is slick and fresh but completely without character. This is a disappointing and lifeless film. It wants to be '2001' but, well, see above.

So as a whole, Star Trek: The Motion Picture, while being a slow paced and sometimes dragging film, is still a good work of art. It was an interesting introduction to the Star Trek franchise, and as of now I still like it. I recommend it to anyone who likes Star Trek, or to anyone who want to get into Stat Trek. On the other hand, I still love Star Wars better. 8/10.

    Recently I browsed in my archive for good documentary on sci-fi cinema. Of course opinions vary but "Star Trek: The Movie" (1979) offers a good example for the Director's Cut and its bonuses. The movie is landmark in space cinema and although it came two years later than "Star Wars" (1977) it still counted first because of the longest pre-production period. It also involved controversies with director Robert Wise (19142005) and producer Gene Roddenberry (19211991) who are idiosyncratic names for cinema and sci-fi literature, respectfully. The bonus material on DVD is interesting as to the fact that we see something of Robert Wise on rare footage. The latter is quite worn out from age but have mind as a razor. He reminds very much of his friend and colleague Ray Harryhausen (19202013) - acknowledged guru of special effects cinema - in the latest years of his life when he divulges secrets of his craftsmanship and communicates with his followers students (i.e. George Lucas of "Star Wars" is one of them). Add here George Pal (19081980) and Stanley Kubrick (19281999) and you could have a full staff for sci-fi cinema history, ditto. As for Gene Roddenberry the story stays a bit different. I have in my archive more books about him than video footage. Apparently he didn't appear very much in front of the camera or maybe I am mistaken. On the bonus disk his widow Majel Barrett narrates very extensively how they bargain very hard to rip-off the Movie from TV. Gene was as much manager as a scripter and a producer. He was also a former policeman and founding member of World Sci-fi Association. Ray Bradbury, Isaac Asimov and many other celebrity writers were his personal friends. Whoopi Goldberg made her film debut on his recommendation. Thank you.

    The first cinema outing for the franchise has none of the strong characterisation or sense of adventure present in the TV series; it's as if the makers thought that the move to the big screen meant they'd better play it all po-faced, and in the process the atmosphere has been lost. Returning regulars William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley et al have little to besides react to what's going on around them, the writers instead preferring to concentrate on new characters who make no impression, such as Stephen Collins's flavourless captain. The movie was developed from the ashes of a proposed revival of the TV series, but after three episodes of these guys you'd have turned over to 'Space: 1999'. Developments late in the plot are thoughtful but entirely without impact and are never interesting enough to warrant the interminable build up. Virtually nothing happens through the middle and the pace is sometimes agonisingly slow (the Enterprise docking sequence, for example), director Robert Wise making almost every shot twice as long as it needs to be. The production design, too, is slick and fresh but completely without character. This is a disappointing and lifeless film. It wants to be '2001' but, well, see above.

    I say you will either love this or hate it because I personally loved it, but I could see why a lot of people say what they do about this film. I grew up with this movie. I was 5 when it came out and it's in my earliest memories of watching it on the Sunday Night Movie. I've watched the quality of it progress as media technology has progressed. People say it's too long and I might agree with that. The scenes entering the cloud could have been cut down, but I think the director tried his best at creating an epic storyline and almost pulled it off. The movie isn't action packed but it's intelligent. They managed to take Star Trek in directions they hadn't or couldn't in the TV show. Panning over the ship for a full instrumental sequence was long winded but it was the first time anyone had seen the ship up close for the first time and in that context it has to be appreciated. The story took the time to answer simple questions a lot of people had pondered like "what would it be like if the transporter malfunctioned" and "what if the warp drive malfunctioned mid-warp". The twist at the end was brilliant, in my opinion. It was a slower movie, but I still feel it kept a steady pace. People say it was too serious, but there's quite a few little jokes along the way. The music in it is top notch. The movie was made during a time when musical scores where just as much of a character in a movie as the rest of the cast. This movie is no exception. The federation theme music was good enough for The Next Generation to use it for the show's theme music. It does a great job of creating mood as well as greatly enhancing the atmosphere of all the important scenes. I guess to sum it up, I wouldn't use this movie to introduce someone to Star Trek. I would however try and put myself in the place of someone who had jumped on the series bandwagon way back when and was finally experiencing the long awaited movie for the first time in the theater on opening day! That excitement and nostalgia blended together must have been amazing and trying to capture that while watching the movie would greatly enhance the experience of someone who successfully accomplishes it. I gave it a 9 and not a 10 because it does have some sketchy editing in a couple places where there could have been better continuity. Other than that I think it's a solid film and anyone who's a Star Trek fan should try and appreciate what the intentions of the movie were and not pit it against other blockbuster movies, especially one's from today's star date!

    This gets 7/10 from me, even if I don't rewatch it all that often (ST4 is the one I've watched most times I think). I would watch it more often but I know few people who like it that much. Apart from finally seeing NGC-1701 on the big screen, there's a lot to like here. Thought-provoking SF (rare on film), not exciting but interesting, and conflicts solved in an intelligent manner by thinking characters. The slow approach to the Enterprise will probably bore general audiences to tears nowadays; I find it not a second too long. The SFX inside V'ger have a dreamlike quality not unlike those at the end of 2001, and the V'ger set itself has an otherworldly, yet simple, look that's sorely missing from many of today's SF which always tries to go for gritty/realistic.

    Star Trek: The Motion Picture **1/2 (out of 4) 132 mins/ U Cast: William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan Director: Robert Wise Plot: When a mysterious object is found to be approaching Earth at rapid speeds, Captain Kirk and his crew set out to prevent it doing so. JJ's Verdict: Featuring the entire original Star Trek cast from the television series, 'The Motion Picture' was only made after the success of 70's sci-fi films like Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The plot is very simple and was made that way so new fans could become interested in the series. The film focuses on the crew trying to intercept V-GER, a mysterious object fast approaching Earth. Tensions rise as the crew argue about what to do and how to stop the object from destroying mankind. Despite this, the dialogue continually makes references to out of space objects and rituals, which, to someone completely foreign to the Star Trek Universe, left me bewildered. The film has other problems as well. The visual effects, while alright, aren't good enough to seem realistic and for you to take the film seriously. The acting is good enough with William Shatner leading the way in terms of any sign of emotion and while the ending is actually very exciting and surprisingly interesting, 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' is nothing more than a decent sci-fi film.

    I want to start by saying this movie makes me feel conflicted. I love all the characters, but the movie moves so slow. It was most people call it a motionless picture. It is very slow plot wise and doesn't give me that pizazz like other Trek films. I wish to say I could love this film because I wanted to after loving this characters, but i couldn't. I gave it a 6 when I would rather give it a 6.5 because I think that is what it is. The plot also fell a little flat for me and the ending just didn't do it for me. This film was made after Star Wars so it created even more hate when it shouldn't. If this film was made before Star Wars, I would think that it would probably be rated closer to 7 than 6. I have to give it credit for keeping this franchise alive so it could spawn 5 sequels, then a few television shows one of which spawned four films and was rebooted in 2009 with 2 films already. All in all it doesn't deserve all of the crap it gets, but some of it is justifiable.

    This is the first Star Trek film after the hit TV series, and the film is overall a bust. The film has some very pointless scenes that take way too long and the story is rather boring as when you finally get to it, you kind of gave up on the movie. The movie takes about 40 minutes to get started and this involves assembling the old gang back together which was nice to see them again, but one of the first pointless scenes was when Kirk is heading to the Enterprise in a shuttle. The scene takes forever and is not well done. After it gets rolling, the last 50 minutes or so are decent for being an episode on television, but not on the big screen. The cast was still lovable and lost none of their charms after being absent for a while but this movie had so many possible ways to go and it took the wrong path for most of the film. The film looked nice which is a bonus as we did get to most of the system and it looked neat, but some of the scenes are overdone with camera work and takes a long time for us to soak things in and/or get impatient. I love the idea of bringing it to the big screen, but I wish they made better decisions. Me: 3/5 Audience: 3.15/5

    Star Trek: The Motion Picture is a good movie with a storyline that gets a bit carried away with itself,but a strong cast and brilliant characters still make this movie watchable.I am not a huge fan of Star Trek,but every time I watch it I enjoy it,and I do understand why this movie would disappoint a lot of the die hard Star Trek fans,probably the most loyal fans on the planet.I found the story and some of the dialogue stupid at times,but I still enjoyed this movie because William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy still manage to deliver great performances as Captain Kirk and Spock.Trekkies will definitely be disappointed with their first big screen adventure and should probably just watch three episodes in a row instead,but I do feel people who enjoy sci-fi that aren't die hard fans could enjoy Star Trek: The Motion Picture a lot more. Captain Kirk leads the Starship Enterprise to put a stop to an entity on its way to Earth to find its creator.

    They really don't make them like this any more. Couldn't. Imagine if Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman had walked into the Paramount offices and slammed THIS script on the table: A slow, solemn, philosophically dense adventure into a cloud of gas, with barely an action scene in sight and no conventional enemy. Almost a decade previously, Robert Wise directed The Andromeda Strain, the quintessential "hard" sci-fi of the 1970s, where the emphasis was on the science, and the action took place on computer readouts. And two decades before that he made The Day the Earth Stood Still, a 1950s monster movie without a monster, standing out at the time for its seriousness. Star Trek The Motion Picture could be seen as Wise's homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey. There are lengthy sequences (I'm talking 10 minutes at a time) basically constituted of extended fly-bys of Douglas Trumbull's still-extraordinary special effects. Throughout, there's an admirable dedication to awe, something often missing from modern sci-fi, where a black hole is no more than a flying mouth and spacetime is traversed in a shrug. If only there'd been equivalent care shown to the characters. Unfortunately, they are reduced to mere tour guides on this fantastic adventure, showing us when to gaze agape in wonderment, and verbalising what is frankly apparent from the images. The ending is like the birth of the Starchild with a director's commentary rambling over the top. Kirk (William Shatner, subtle in portraying the humility of his out-of-practice captain) and Spock (the monolithic Leonard Nimoy) are present, and the friendship is as tender and fraught as ever - but they have only one really good scene together. Instead, the focus is on the star-cross'd relationship between the Deltan Ilia (a chilling Persis Khambatta) and acting-captain Decker (Stephen Collins), which is sadly rather drab and unconvincing. The Motion Picture may not be the finest film in the original Star Trek series, but it's certainly the most distinctive and the strangest - a far, far cry from Star Trek IV's terrestrial comedy. What it lacks in humour and emotional resonance, The Motion Picture makes up for with its grand scope and vision, sometimes sparking the senses and stirring the imagination.

    Let me start off by saying that I never watched any episode of Star Trek before I saw this. Up until recently, the Star Trek franchise in general was like a foreign language to me, and I knew just about nothing about it. When Star Trek: Into Darkness was coming out, I decided to give this movie a watch, since the time felt right for me to do so. And 2 hours and 20 minutes later, I was a Star Trek fan. Now granted, this is not a perfect movie by any means. A lot of the effects shots can drag out for quite a while, and some things can even get confusing as a result of that. But I was able to get past that, and I was rewarded with a satisfying Star Trek experience as a result. The plot was compelling and interesting, and it felt right for something with the Star Trek name on it. The characters took a while to get used to for me, but by the end I knew who they all were. The special effects, though very slow moving and primitive by today's standards, still look good for their time. I know it was trying to be like 2001: A Space Odyssey, but even so, some of the effects shots that tried to mimic that still look good now. (And no, I didn't see the enhanced director's cut, I saw the original version). I think that my favorite aspect of Star Trek: The Motion Picture though, is the philosophies that is was conveying. I think Spock said it best when he said, "Logic is never alone", implying that there is a God, and he plays a part in everything that involves the unexplained. I never expected to find such elements to a Star Trek film, and there are others around the movie as well. One other one involves the never ending search for knowledge, and plenty of others that I can't remember at the moment. So as a whole, Star Trek: The Motion Picture, while being a slow paced and sometimes dragging film, is still a good work of art. It was an interesting introduction to the Star Trek franchise, and as of now I still like it. I recommend it to anyone who likes Star Trek, or to anyone who want to get into Stat Trek. On the other hand, I still love Star Wars better. 8/10.

Captain Kirk leads the Starship Enterprise to put a stop to an entity on its way to Earth to find its creator.

    They really don't make them like this any more. Couldn't. Imagine if Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman had walked into the Paramount offices and slammed THIS script on the table: A slow, solemn, philosophically dense adventure into a cloud of gas, with barely an action scene in sight and no conventional enemy. Almost a decade previously, Robert Wise directed The Andromeda Strain, the quintessential "hard" sci-fi of the 1970s, where the emphasis was on the science, and the action took place on computer readouts. And two decades before that he made The Day the Earth Stood Still, a 1950s monster movie without a monster, standing out at the time for its seriousness. Star Trek The Motion Picture could be seen as Wise's homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey. There are lengthy sequences (I'm talking 10 minutes at a time) basically constituted of extended fly-bys of Douglas Trumbull's still-extraordinary special effects. Throughout, there's an admirable dedication to awe, something often missing from modern sci-fi, where a black hole is no more than a flying mouth and spacetime is traversed in a shrug. If only there'd been equivalent care shown to the characters. Unfortunately, they are reduced to mere tour guides on this fantastic adventure, showing us when to gaze agape in wonderment, and verbalising what is frankly apparent from the images. The ending is like the birth of the Starchild with a director's commentary rambling over the top. Kirk (William Shatner, subtle in portraying the humility of his out-of-practice captain) and Spock (the monolithic Leonard Nimoy) are present, and the friendship is as tender and fraught as ever - but they have only one really good scene together. Instead, the focus is on the star-cross'd relationship between the Deltan Ilia (a chilling Persis Khambatta) and acting-captain Decker (Stephen Collins), which is sadly rather drab and unconvincing. The Motion Picture may not be the finest film in the original Star Trek series, but it's certainly the most distinctive and the strangest - a far, far cry from Star Trek IV's terrestrial comedy. What it lacks in humour and emotional resonance, The Motion Picture makes up for with its grand scope and vision, sometimes sparking the senses and stirring the imagination.

    Let me start off by saying that I never watched any episode of Star Trek before I saw this. Up until recently, the Star Trek franchise in general was like a foreign language to me, and I knew just about nothing about it. When Star Trek: Into Darkness was coming out, I decided to give this movie a watch, since the time felt right for me to do so. And 2 hours and 20 minutes later, I was a Star Trek fan. Now granted, this is not a perfect movie by any means. A lot of the effects shots can drag out for quite a while, and some things can even get confusing as a result of that. But I was able to get past that, and I was rewarded with a satisfying Star Trek experience as a result. The plot was compelling and interesting, and it felt right for something with the Star Trek name on it. The characters took a while to get used to for me, but by the end I knew who they all were. The special effects, though very slow moving and primitive by today's standards, still look good for their time. I know it was trying to be like 2001: A Space Odyssey, but even so, some of the effects shots that tried to mimic that still look good now. (And no, I didn't see the enhanced director's cut, I saw the original version). I think that my favorite aspect of Star Trek: The Motion Picture though, is the philosophies that is was conveying. I think Spock said it best when he said, "Logic is never alone", implying that there is a God, and he plays a part in everything that involves the unexplained. I never expected to find such elements to a Star Trek film, and there are others around the movie as well. One other one involves the never ending search for knowledge, and plenty of others that I can't remember at the moment. So as a whole, Star Trek: The Motion Picture, while being a slow paced and sometimes dragging film, is still a good work of art. It was an interesting introduction to the Star Trek franchise, and as of now I still like it. I recommend it to anyone who likes Star Trek, or to anyone who want to get into Stat Trek. On the other hand, I still love Star Wars better. 8/10.

    Recently I browsed in my archive for good documentary on sci-fi cinema. Of course opinions vary but "Star Trek: The Movie" (1979) offers a good example for the Director's Cut and its bonuses. The movie is landmark in space cinema and although it came two years later than "Star Wars" (1977) it still counted first because of the longest pre-production period. It also involved controversies with director Robert Wise (19142005) and producer Gene Roddenberry (19211991) who are idiosyncratic names for cinema and sci-fi literature, respectfully. The bonus material on DVD is interesting as to the fact that we see something of Robert Wise on rare footage. The latter is quite worn out from age but have mind as a razor. He reminds very much of his friend and colleague Ray Harryhausen (19202013) - acknowledged guru of special effects cinema - in the latest years of his life when he divulges secrets of his craftsmanship and communicates with his followers students (i.e. George Lucas of "Star Wars" is one of them). Add here George Pal (19081980) and Stanley Kubrick (19281999) and you could have a full staff for sci-fi cinema history, ditto. As for Gene Roddenberry the story stays a bit different. I have in my archive more books about him than video footage. Apparently he didn't appear very much in front of the camera or maybe I am mistaken. On the bonus disk his widow Majel Barrett narrates very extensively how they bargain very hard to rip-off the Movie from TV. Gene was as much manager as a scripter and a producer. He was also a former policeman and founding member of World Sci-fi Association. Ray Bradbury, Isaac Asimov and many other celebrity writers were his personal friends. Whoopi Goldberg made her film debut on his recommendation. Thank you.

    The first cinema outing for the franchise has none of the strong characterisation or sense of adventure present in the TV series; it's as if the makers thought that the move to the big screen meant they'd better play it all po-faced, and in the process the atmosphere has been lost. Returning regulars William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley et al have little to besides react to what's going on around them, the writers instead preferring to concentrate on new characters who make no impression, such as Stephen Collins's flavourless captain. The movie was developed from the ashes of a proposed revival of the TV series, but after three episodes of these guys you'd have turned over to 'Space: 1999'. Developments late in the plot are thoughtful but entirely without impact and are never interesting enough to warrant the interminable build up. Virtually nothing happens through the middle and the pace is sometimes agonisingly slow (the Enterprise docking sequence, for example), director Robert Wise making almost every shot twice as long as it needs to be. The production design, too, is slick and fresh but completely without character. This is a disappointing and lifeless film. It wants to be '2001' but, well, see above.

    I say you will either love this or hate it because I personally loved it, but I could see why a lot of people say what they do about this film. I grew up with this movie. I was 5 when it came out and it's in my earliest memories of watching it on the Sunday Night Movie. I've watched the quality of it progress as media technology has progressed. People say it's too long and I might agree with that. The scenes entering the cloud could have been cut down, but I think the director tried his best at creating an epic storyline and almost pulled it off. The movie isn't action packed but it's intelligent. They managed to take Star Trek in directions they hadn't or couldn't in the TV show. Panning over the ship for a full instrumental sequence was long winded but it was the first time anyone had seen the ship up close for the first time and in that context it has to be appreciated. The story took the time to answer simple questions a lot of people had pondered like "what would it be like if the transporter malfunctioned" and "what if the warp drive malfunctioned mid-warp". The twist at the end was brilliant, in my opinion. It was a slower movie, but I still feel it kept a steady pace. People say it was too serious, but there's quite a few little jokes along the way. The music in it is top notch. The movie was made during a time when musical scores where just as much of a character in a movie as the rest of the cast. This movie is no exception. The federation theme music was good enough for The Next Generation to use it for the show's theme music. It does a great job of creating mood as well as greatly enhancing the atmosphere of all the important scenes. I guess to sum it up, I wouldn't use this movie to introduce someone to Star Trek. I would however try and put myself in the place of someone who had jumped on the series bandwagon way back when and was finally experiencing the long awaited movie for the first time in the theater on opening day! That excitement and nostalgia blended together must have been amazing and trying to capture that while watching the movie would greatly enhance the experience of someone who successfully accomplishes it. I gave it a 9 and not a 10 because it does have some sketchy editing in a couple places where there could have been better continuity. Other than that I think it's a solid film and anyone who's a Star Trek fan should try and appreciate what the intentions of the movie were and not pit it against other blockbuster movies, especially one's from today's star date!

    This gets 7/10 from me, even if I don't rewatch it all that often (ST4 is the one I've watched most times I think). I would watch it more often but I know few people who like it that much. Apart from finally seeing NGC-1701 on the big screen, there's a lot to like here. Thought-provoking SF (rare on film), not exciting but interesting, and conflicts solved in an intelligent manner by thinking characters. The slow approach to the Enterprise will probably bore general audiences to tears nowadays; I find it not a second too long. The SFX inside V'ger have a dreamlike quality not unlike those at the end of 2001, and the V'ger set itself has an otherworldly, yet simple, look that's sorely missing from many of today's SF which always tries to go for gritty/realistic.

    Star Trek: The Motion Picture **1/2 (out of 4) 132 mins/ U Cast: William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan Director: Robert Wise Plot: When a mysterious object is found to be approaching Earth at rapid speeds, Captain Kirk and his crew set out to prevent it doing so. JJ's Verdict: Featuring the entire original Star Trek cast from the television series, 'The Motion Picture' was only made after the success of 70's sci-fi films like Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The plot is very simple and was made that way so new fans could become interested in the series. The film focuses on the crew trying to intercept V-GER, a mysterious object fast approaching Earth. Tensions rise as the crew argue about what to do and how to stop the object from destroying mankind. Despite this, the dialogue continually makes references to out of space objects and rituals, which, to someone completely foreign to the Star Trek Universe, left me bewildered. The film has other problems as well. The visual effects, while alright, aren't good enough to seem realistic and for you to take the film seriously. The acting is good enough with William Shatner leading the way in terms of any sign of emotion and while the ending is actually very exciting and surprisingly interesting, 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' is nothing more than a decent sci-fi film.

    I want to start by saying this movie makes me feel conflicted. I love all the characters, but the movie moves so slow. It was most people call it a motionless picture. It is very slow plot wise and doesn't give me that pizazz like other Trek films. I wish to say I could love this film because I wanted to after loving this characters, but i couldn't. I gave it a 6 when I would rather give it a 6.5 because I think that is what it is. The plot also fell a little flat for me and the ending just didn't do it for me. This film was made after Star Wars so it created even more hate when it shouldn't. If this film was made before Star Wars, I would think that it would probably be rated closer to 7 than 6. I have to give it credit for keeping this franchise alive so it could spawn 5 sequels, then a few television shows one of which spawned four films and was rebooted in 2009 with 2 films already. All in all it doesn't deserve all of the crap it gets, but some of it is justifiable.

    This is the first Star Trek film after the hit TV series, and the film is overall a bust. The film has some very pointless scenes that take way too long and the story is rather boring as when you finally get to it, you kind of gave up on the movie. The movie takes about 40 minutes to get started and this involves assembling the old gang back together which was nice to see them again, but one of the first pointless scenes was when Kirk is heading to the Enterprise in a shuttle. The scene takes forever and is not well done. After it gets rolling, the last 50 minutes or so are decent for being an episode on television, but not on the big screen. The cast was still lovable and lost none of their charms after being absent for a while but this movie had so many possible ways to go and it took the wrong path for most of the film. The film looked nice which is a bonus as we did get to most of the system and it looked neat, but some of the scenes are overdone with camera work and takes a long time for us to soak things in and/or get impatient. I love the idea of bringing it to the big screen, but I wish they made better decisions. Me: 3/5 Audience: 3.15/5

    Star Trek: The Motion Picture **1/2 (out of 4) 132 mins/ U Cast: William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan Director: Robert Wise Plot: When a mysterious object is found to be approaching Earth at rapid speeds, Captain Kirk and his crew set out to prevent it doing so. JJ's Verdict: Featuring the entire original Star Trek cast from the television series, 'The Motion Picture' was only made after the success of 70's sci-fi films like Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The plot is very simple and was made that way so new fans could become interested in the series. The film focuses on the crew trying to intercept V-GER, a mysterious object fast approaching Earth. Tensions rise as the crew argue about what to do and how to stop the object from destroying mankind. Despite this, the dialogue continually makes references to out of space objects and rituals, which, to someone completely foreign to the Star Trek Universe, left me bewildered. The film has other problems as well. The visual effects, while alright, aren't good enough to seem realistic and for you to take the film seriously. The acting is good enough with William Shatner leading the way in terms of any sign of emotion and while the ending is actually very exciting and surprisingly interesting, 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' is nothing more than a decent sci-fi film.

    I want to start by saying this movie makes me feel conflicted. I love all the characters, but the movie moves so slow. It was most people call it a motionless picture. It is very slow plot wise and doesn't give me that pizazz like other Trek films. I wish to say I could love this film because I wanted to after loving this characters, but i couldn't. I gave it a 6 when I would rather give it a 6.5 because I think that is what it is. The plot also fell a little flat for me and the ending just didn't do it for me. This film was made after Star Wars so it created even more hate when it shouldn't. If this film was made before Star Wars, I would think that it would probably be rated closer to 7 than 6. I have to give it credit for keeping this franchise alive so it could spawn 5 sequels, then a few television shows one of which spawned four films and was rebooted in 2009 with 2 films already. All in all it doesn't deserve all of the crap it gets, but some of it is justifiable.

    This is the first Star Trek film after the hit TV series, and the film is overall a bust. The film has some very pointless scenes that take way too long and the story is rather boring as when you finally get to it, you kind of gave up on the movie. The movie takes about 40 minutes to get started and this involves assembling the old gang back together which was nice to see them again, but one of the first pointless scenes was when Kirk is heading to the Enterprise in a shuttle. The scene takes forever and is not well done. After it gets rolling, the last 50 minutes or so are decent for being an episode on television, but not on the big screen. The cast was still lovable and lost none of their charms after being absent for a while but this movie had so many possible ways to go and it took the wrong path for most of the film. The film looked nice which is a bonus as we did get to most of the system and it looked neat, but some of the scenes are overdone with camera work and takes a long time for us to soak things in and/or get impatient. I love the idea of bringing it to the big screen, but I wish they made better decisions. Me: 3/5 Audience: 3.15/5

    Star Trek: The Motion Picture is a good movie with a storyline that gets a bit carried away with itself,but a strong cast and brilliant characters still make this movie watchable.I am not a huge fan of Star Trek,but every time I watch it I enjoy it,and I do understand why this movie would disappoint a lot of the die hard Star Trek fans,probably the most loyal fans on the planet.I found the story and some of the dialogue stupid at times,but I still enjoyed this movie because William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy still manage to deliver great performances as Captain Kirk and Spock.Trekkies will definitely be disappointed with their first big screen adventure and should probably just watch three episodes in a row instead,but I do feel people who enjoy sci-fi that aren't die hard fans could enjoy Star Trek: The Motion Picture a lot more. Captain Kirk leads the Starship Enterprise to put a stop to an entity on its way to Earth to find its creator.

    They really don't make them like this any more. Couldn't. Imagine if Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman had walked into the Paramount offices and slammed THIS script on the table: A slow, solemn, philosophically dense adventure into a cloud of gas, with barely an action scene in sight and no conventional enemy. Almost a decade previously, Robert Wise directed The Andromeda Strain, the quintessential "hard" sci-fi of the 1970s, where the emphasis was on the science, and the action took place on computer readouts. And two decades before that he made The Day the Earth Stood Still, a 1950s monster movie without a monster, standing out at the time for its seriousness. Star Trek The Motion Picture could be seen as Wise's homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey. There are lengthy sequences (I'm talking 10 minutes at a time) basically constituted of extended fly-bys of Douglas Trumbull's still-extraordinary special effects. Throughout, there's an admirable dedication to awe, something often missing from modern sci-fi, where a black hole is no more than a flying mouth and spacetime is traversed in a shrug. If only there'd been equivalent care shown to the characters. Unfortunately, they are reduced to mere tour guides on this fantastic adventure, showing us when to gaze agape in wonderment, and verbalising what is frankly apparent from the images. The ending is like the birth of the Starchild with a director's commentary rambling over the top. Kirk (William Shatner, subtle in portraying the humility of his out-of-practice captain) and Spock (the monolithic Leonard Nimoy) are present, and the friendship is as tender and fraught as ever - but they have only one really good scene together. Instead, the focus is on the star-cross'd relationship between the Deltan Ilia (a chilling Persis Khambatta) and acting-captain Decker (Stephen Collins), which is sadly rather drab and unconvincing. The Motion Picture may not be the finest film in the original Star Trek series, but it's certainly the most distinctive and the strangest - a far, far cry from Star Trek IV's terrestrial comedy. What it lacks in humour and emotional resonance, The Motion Picture makes up for with its grand scope and vision, sometimes sparking the senses and stirring the imagination.

    Let me start off by saying that I never watched any episode of Star Trek before I saw this. Up until recently, the Star Trek franchise in general was like a foreign language to me, and I knew just about nothing about it. When Star Trek: Into Darkness was coming out, I decided to give this movie a watch, since the time felt right for me to do so. And 2 hours and 20 minutes later, I was a Star Trek fan. Now granted, this is not a perfect movie by any means. A lot of the effects shots can drag out for quite a while, and some things can even get confusing as a result of that. But I was able to get past that, and I was rewarded with a satisfying Star Trek experience as a result. The plot was compelling and interesting, and it felt right for something with the Star Trek name on it. The characters took a while to get used to for me, but by the end I knew who they all were. The special effects, though very slow moving and primitive by today's standards, still look good for their time. I know it was trying to be like 2001: A Space Odyssey, but even so, some of the effects shots that tried to mimic that still look good now. (And no, I didn't see the enhanced director's cut, I saw the original version). I think that my favorite aspect of Star Trek: The Motion Picture though, is the philosophies that is was conveying. I think Spock said it best when he said, "Logic is never alone", implying that there is a God, and he plays a part in everything that involves the unexplained. I never expected to find such elements to a Star Trek film, and there are others around the movie as well. One other one involves the never ending search for knowledge, and plenty of others that I can't remember at the moment. So as a whole, Star Trek: The Motion Picture, while being a slow paced and sometimes dragging film, is still a good work of art. It was an interesting introduction to the Star Trek franchise, and as of now I still like it. I recommend it to anyone who likes Star Trek, or to anyone who want to get into Stat Trek. On the other hand, I still love Star Wars better. 8/10.

    Recently I browsed in my archive for good documentary on sci-fi cinema. Of course opinions vary but "Star Trek: The Movie" (1979) offers a good example for the Director's Cut and its bonuses. The movie is landmark in space cinema and although it came two years later than "Star Wars" (1977) it still counted first because of the longest pre-production period. It also involved controversies with director Robert Wise (19142005) and producer Gene Roddenberry (19211991) who are idiosyncratic names for cinema and sci-fi literature, respectfully. The bonus material on DVD is interesting as to the fact that we see something of Robert Wise on rare footage. The latter is quite worn out from age but have mind as a razor. He reminds very much of his friend and colleague Ray Harryhausen (19202013) - acknowledged guru of special effects cinema - in the latest years of his life when he divulges secrets of his craftsmanship and communicates with his followers students (i.e. George Lucas of "Star Wars" is one of them). Add here George Pal (19081980) and Stanley Kubrick (19281999) and you could have a full staff for sci-fi cinema history, ditto. As for Gene Roddenberry the story stays a bit different. I have in my archive more books about him than video footage. Apparently he didn't appear very much in front of the camera or maybe I am mistaken. On the bonus disk his widow Majel Barrett narrates very extensively how they bargain very hard to rip-off the Movie from TV. Gene was as much manager as a scripter and a producer. He was also a former policeman and founding member of World Sci-fi Association. Ray Bradbury, Isaac Asimov and many other celebrity writers were his personal friends. Whoopi Goldberg made her film debut on his recommendation. Thank you.

    The first cinema outing for the franchise has none of the strong characterisation or sense of adventure present in the TV series; it's as if the makers thought that the move to the big screen meant they'd better play it all po-faced, and in the process the atmosphere has been lost. Returning regulars William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley et al have little to besides react to what's going on around them, the writers instead preferring to concentrate on new characters who make no impression, such as Stephen Collins's flavourless captain. The movie was developed from the ashes of a proposed revival of the TV series, but after three episodes of these guys you'd have turned over to 'Space: 1999'. Developments late in the plot are thoughtful but entirely without impact and are never interesting enough to warrant the interminable build up. Virtually nothing happens through the middle and the pace is sometimes agonisingly slow (the Enterprise docking sequence, for example), director Robert Wise making almost every shot twice as long as it needs to be. The production design, too, is slick and fresh but completely without character. This is a disappointing and lifeless film. It wants to be '2001' but, well, see above.

    I say you will either love this or hate it because I personally loved it, but I could see why a lot of people say what they do about this film. I grew up with this movie. I was 5 when it came out and it's in my earliest memories of watching it on the Sunday Night Movie. I've watched the quality of it progress as media technology has progressed. People say it's too long and I might agree with that. The scenes entering the cloud could have been cut down, but I think the director tried his best at creating an epic storyline and almost pulled it off. The movie isn't action packed but it's intelligent. They managed to take Star Trek in directions they hadn't or couldn't in the TV show. Panning over the ship for a full instrumental sequence was long winded but it was the first time anyone had seen the ship up close for the first time and in that context it has to be appreciated. The story took the time to answer simple questions a lot of people had pondered like "what would it be like if the transporter malfunctioned" and "what if the warp drive malfunctioned mid-warp". The twist at the end was brilliant, in my opinion. It was a slower movie, but I still feel it kept a steady pace. People say it was too serious, but there's quite a few little jokes along the way. The music in it is top notch. The movie was made during a time when musical scores where just as much of a character in a movie as the rest of the cast. This movie is no exception. The federation theme music was good enough for The Next Generation to use it for the show's theme music. It does a great job of creating mood as well as greatly enhancing the atmosphere of all the important scenes. I guess to sum it up, I wouldn't use this movie to introduce someone to Star Trek. I would however try and put myself in the place of someone who had jumped on the series bandwagon way back when and was finally experiencing the long awaited movie for the first time in the theater on opening day! That excitement and nostalgia blended together must have been amazing and trying to capture that while watching the movie would greatly enhance the experience of someone who successfully accomplishes it. I gave it a 9 and not a 10 because it does have some sketchy editing in a couple places where there could have been better continuity. Other than that I think it's a solid film and anyone who's a Star Trek fan should try and appreciate what the intentions of the movie were and not pit it against other blockbuster movies, especially one's from today's star date!

    This gets 7/10 from me, even if I don't rewatch it all that often (ST4 is the one I've watched most times I think). I would watch it more often but I know few people who like it that much. Apart from finally seeing NGC-1701 on the big screen, there's a lot to like here. Thought-provoking SF (rare on film), not exciting but interesting, and conflicts solved in an intelligent manner by thinking characters. The slow approach to the Enterprise will probably bore general audiences to tears nowadays; I find it not a second too long. The SFX inside V'ger have a dreamlike quality not unlike those at the end of 2001, and the V'ger set itself has an otherworldly, yet simple, look that's sorely missing from many of today's SF which always tries to go for gritty/realistic.
