 <sinopse>
  A Vietnam vet adjusts to life after the war while trying to support his family, but the chance of a better life may involve crime and bloodshed.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  This action film, directed by the Hughes brothers, depicts a heist of old bills, retired from circulation and destined by the government to be "money to burn." However, more broadly, it addresses the issues of Black Americans' involvement in the Vietnam War and their subsequent disillusionment with progress in social issues and civil rights back home in the United States, during the 1960's.

    when I first bought the movie I had no idea that it had to do with soldiers coming back from Vietnam. I thought it was just another run of the mill bank robbery movie , with our villains dressing up as dead president't ala Point Break. wrong,, my bad.. so it was interesting to see what the effects of the war brought on these 4 gentleman who come back from Vietnam with obvious pain and mental issues to deal with, besides the fact that they are back in society now , and not in the jungle anymore, they have to deal with wives. family, jobs, finances, how to live in society, well for the most part it get's the better of all of these gentleman one by one,, I did like the robbery scene very much,, the action was good, the pacing wasn't too bad. and I will have to give this movie another look and see in the near future.

    A young black man Anthony Curtis is about to graduate from college in 1969 and volunteers from the United States Marine Corps . Coming home after a tour in the early 1970s . Needing a focus in life Anthony finds himself being drawn in to a life of crime DEAD PRESIDENTS was released in 1995 with a fair amount of hype . Directed by the Hughes brothers it was marketed as a film that marketed the black experience of coming home after Vietnam . One can understand why the film was marketed this way since the Hughes did make the critically acclaimed MENACE II SOCIETY , part of a short lived but acclaimed " Ghetto subgenre " in the early 1990s . DEAD PRESIDENTS might try to fit in to this type of genre but what ever type of movie it's trying to be it fails because there's an obvious flaw - there's not one single likable character in the movie If the Hughes brothers had been white I'm sure they'd have been accused of playing up to ethnic stereotypes or at the very least making a blacksplotation movie twenty years too late . The film starts with some foul mouthed characters lamenting the lack of sex in their lives and goes downhill from there . The film then cuts to Vietnam and if Anthnoy ( And the audience ) thought the ghetto was bad then Vietnam is a lot worse . The war scenes are genuinely disturbing and violent but again this seems very old hat when we'd already had a glut of anti-war films featuring the 'Nam ten years earlier and most of them making an anti-war point much better too . When Anthony returns to America he gets involved in a robbery that makes the Vietnam war look like an episode of TELETUBBIES This is a muddled , unfocused violent film that becomes more and more depressing as it goes along . If the Hughes are making a comment that returning soldiers from conflicts regardless of their colour are callously ignored by the country they fought to defend then they have failed . There's little incitement for the characters to become the violent ruthless criminals they are . Just because an educated college boy fought in a war zone it never seems a convincing character motivation to become a criminal , and the robbery itself on an armoured car is done so graphically and violently is enough to evaporate any potential sympathy one might have had at Anthony's plight Despite being a competently made film , the editing is very good for example , DEAD PRESIDENTS is a classic example of a film having to elicit empathy from the audience and if it fails to do this then the entire film fails

    OK to start off I really liked this movie, it isn't amazing or anything like that but is certainly under appreciated at the least. This film may have not have depicted the Vietnam war correctly or it did. But, the film is made for entertainment purposes not to give you an education. This movie deserved some kind of an Oscar for anything. However, I suppose there is a certain group out there just like every movie has and that is the group who dislikes the movie. I haven't gone through the reviews yet but I'm sure there is someone out there who wrote a review and ended up being ridiculous in some way. Well if you haven't seen it yet I suggest you watch it and post what you think as a review.

    "We are being asked to take even larger doses of a medicine that has proved to be deadly and to undertake commitments that do not solve the problem, but only temporarily postpone the foretold death of our economy." - Hieronymos II (head of Greece's Orthodox Church) "A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defence than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual doom." - Martin Luther King, Jr "Austerity is difficult, absolutely, but it's necessary, for rich and poor alike, black and white." - Frank Campbell "The more things change, the more they stay the same." - Jean Baptiste Karr Albert and Allen Hughes direct "Dead Presidents" and "Menace 2 Society". Both films purport to be "serious" examinations of the trials and tribulations of post-Vietnam African Americans, but in reality function more as giant exploitation films. The influence here is Scorsese's "Goodfellas", which the young Hughes brothers  the perfect age to be seduced by Scorsese's pyrotechnics - attempt to mimic blow for blow. And like Scorsese's film, though absent of his considerable style, the Hughes' work here is thin, melodramatic and sensationalistic, with deaths, screams, headshots, bombast, snorting, swearing and fury schematically rolled out to shock, bludgeon and titillate rather than edify. An entire resurgence in African American film-making would be corrupted in the early 1990s with such films. "This is how it really was," the brothers would claim in interviews, positing their early films as a response to John Singleton's (underrated) "Boyz n the Hood". Their films, the brothers claimed, portrayed the reality behind Singleton's supposedly "rosy" portrayal of the African American experience. But time has been unkind to their pictures. And as the baseline for what constitutes "realism" constantly moves, today "Dead Presidents" and "Menace to Society", once touted as being a form of "black neorealism" or "black naturalism", seem hilariously overcooked and gratuitous. And as with all these films, there is little understanding of why our cast of African Americans do what they do, behave how they behave or examination of the power structures and psycho-socio-economic forces at work. (Both films essentially boil down to blacks killing for money; but "economics" is itself the cause of "the problem", stretching all the way from Vietnam to the Slave Trade to the Roman Empire) Still, there are good moments scattered about. "Menace to Society" opens with its best scene, an impromptu robbery/massacre in which a couple of black kids shockingly gun down the Asian shop-workers who insulted them. If disrespect is the root of all violence, we see that here, the larger marginalization of, or systemic disrespect toward, African Americans breeding both feelings of unworthiness and its opposite, a kind of manic need to protect, sometimes violently, brutalized egos. Black culture may have been mocked in the 90s for its "bling", its hysterical materialism, but this, as well as the numerous riots which rocketed across the US in the early 90s, was an understandable "response" to both widespread feelings of neglect and a culture with conflates wealth and worth. One should not have to prove one's humanity, one's worthiness, and when one is constantly forced to do so, pressure builds and one sometimes snaps. What's pertinent about "Menace's" "snaps" is that the victim's of such black aggression are always minorities or other blacks. Meanwhile, white faces are absent from the picture. Society functions in a similar way, Power deflecting hate away from itself  "down" the "social hierarchy" - and onto others. Unfortunately the rest of the picture degenerates into gratuitous gore and violence. Better than "Menace" is "Dead Presidents", which opens in 1968 and attempts to charter the lives of three friends (played by Larenz Tate, Chris Tucker, and Freddy Rodriguez) from the Bronx. They fight in Vietnam, are abandoned by the state, struggle to make a living, battle addiction and are then drawn to a life of crime. Like "Menance", "Presidents" at time shows traces of political savvy  one of the guards killed during the robbery is himself a Vietnam vet - but sensationalism, cynically employed shocks and thriller set pieces eventually undermine claims to earnestness. Blame Scorsese for this. Singleton's "Boyz n the Hood" was released before "Goodfellas" and so is stylistically somewhat different from most "African American" films of the period. 5/10  Worth one viewing.

    The first time I heard about this movie was when I was reading this in a magazine in spring of 1995 and I was 15 years old at that time, Which had a photo of actor Lawance with his face painted white w black lips which was the famous trade mark of this film. it was also used another movie called Half Baked. But I did barrow this movie from the local library 4 years later when it was on video. Dvds weren't popular yet until the next year. What can I say about this film. The cast was great, Same with the acting. But the violence in this film was intense. After you watch this movie for the first time, you can tell that this movie is not for everyone. Maybe for those who come from a tough nabor gang. Nc-17 was the original rating for this film. But I don't think that the violent, the langued and the drug used weren't closed enough for this film. But if you want to watch a better drama with a black cast in it. Do the right thing is the best one. Now the best and only thing about this film is the movie soundtrack. The soundtrack has the best 1970s Smooth soul hits from such great soul artist like Arthia Franklin, Curtis Mayfeld, Al Green, The O Jays, Issic Hays and Many more.

    I re-watched this for the first time in over 7 years as I dug it out of my VHS collection. Solid socio-political time peace addressing the issues facing young men growing up in the Bronx during the 70's. Good cast with a firm performance by Larenz Tate in the lead role. The movie showcased three distinct times in the lives of the main character, pre war, during Vietnam and post war struggling with life back in society. Good supporting cast with some noteworthy performances by Bookeem Woodbine, Clifton Powell, N'Bushe Wright and Terrance Howard. Howard steals a few scenes in his small role. Chris Tucker was funny with his usual flamboyant, loud and quick witted character that he has since built a solid career on. The ending was moving and powerful and the movie moved along fairly well accept for a scene or two. The soundtrack was fantastic and had me moving in my chair the whole time, worked excellent with the scenes, mood and period of the film. Well worth the watch.

    I think my disappointment for this film is based partially on the hype of a well known UK film journalist who talked of this as a 'must see movie.' So expectations were high but when the credits rolled on at the end I wondered what on earth was so special about the film. The plot was predictable and with so many short scenes there was little time for atmosphere which left the funk and soul heavy sound track to work overtime. I would align this film with Forest Gump in its attempts to show a young man growing up. Weaving adolescence, romance, violence and adventure into the story. This is the most slight reference since the two films qualities are markedly different. Not a single character in Dead Presidents incites any reaction from the audience. The scripts plausibility is questionable in many places, chasms of time are treated as though they have been emotionally filled in. Characters act out their two dimensional emotions towards these situations to move seamlessly onwards. If you feel sympathy for the lead character to begin with once it is revealed he comes from a loving supportive family this is quashed. I don't think you can identify with a character who throws away so much due to arrogance and selfish pride. So if this is the case what where the directors trying to say about this mans life? Nothing in the film allowed us to be enlightened. I wouldn't recommend this film but then I like films which have a depth and are written in a more considered way.

    This movie is just a total waste of time. I'm telling you DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. Terrible Acting, I mean Chris Tucker??? This guy is just horrible. The slowness of this film isn't the only issue I have with it, the directing is awful. Take for example the scenes in Vietnam - how predictable were they??? The camera angles were done by a first time director. The scene at the butcher shop - look how immature this scene really is. Are the people walking by robots? Its as if they tried to over direct them. Scene when girl first meets him her father (Anthony) - is she a Zombie? Its like a 1970s film where they used a puppet to get the child actor's attention. And when he is having nightmares - What the HELL!! OK and last 2 rips: Absolutely needed more music in the background, the silence made some scenes so slow, so boring. And why all the racial references? Just not needed! Skip the waste of 2hrs.

    Please spare me this clich&eacute;: the tragedies of a shell-shocked veteran who comes back to his inner city neighborhood and has trouble finding work, his disillusion with the American dream, and how joining the military was the worst decision he ever made. That I could handle, (because I've seen it a million times), but all that nonsense at the end about "how dare you lock me up, after all I did for this country", spoken by a cop-killer? The Black Panthers are portrayed as strong and justified, when really they were a bunch of jabbering radicals who couldn't grow out of their teenage rebellion. The main character was not screwed by "the man" or "the system", he was just psychotic. A lot of men came back from Vietnam and many were troubled, but most did not hit their wives or robbed armored cars.

The movie showcased three distinct times in the lives of the main character, pre war, during Vietnam and post war struggling with life back in society. Good supporting cast with some noteworthy performances by Bookeem Woodbine, Clifton Powell, N'Bushe Wright and Terrance Howard. Howard steals a few scenes in his small role. Chris Tucker was funny with his usual flamboyant, loud and quick witted character that he has since built a solid career on. The ending was moving and powerful and the movie moved along fairly well accept for a scene or two. The soundtrack was fantastic and had me moving in my chair the whole time, worked excellent with the scenes, mood and period of the film. Well worth the watch.

    I think my disappointment for this film is based partially on the hype of a well known UK film journalist who talked of this as a 'must see movie.' So expectations were high but when the credits rolled on at the end I wondered what on earth was so special about the film. The plot was predictable and with so many short scenes there was little time for atmosphere which left the funk and soul heavy sound track to work overtime. I would align this film with Forest Gump in its attempts to show a young man growing up. Weaving adolescence, romance, violence and adventure into the story. This is the most slight reference since the two films qualities are markedly different. Not a single character in Dead Presidents incites any reaction from the audience. The scripts plausibility is questionable in many places, chasms of time are treated as though they have been emotionally filled in. Characters act out their two dimensional emotions towards these situations to move seamlessly onwards. If you feel sympathy for the lead character to begin with once it is revealed he comes from a loving supportive family this is quashed. I don't think you can identify with a character who throws away so much due to arrogance and selfish pride. So if this is the case what where the directors trying to say about this mans life? Nothing in the film allowed us to be enlightened. I wouldn't recommend this film but then I like films which have a depth and are written in a more considered way.

    This movie is just a total waste of time. I'm telling you DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. Terrible Acting, I mean Chris Tucker??? This guy is just horrible. The slowness of this film isn't the only issue I have with it, the directing is awful. Take for example the scenes in Vietnam - how predictable were they??? The camera angles were done by a first time director. The scene at the butcher shop - look how immature this scene really is. Are the people walking by robots? Its as if they tried to over direct them. Scene when girl first meets him her father (Anthony) - is she a Zombie? Its like a 1970s film where they used a puppet to get the child actor's attention. And when he is having nightmares - What the HELL!! OK and last 2 rips: Absolutely needed more music in the background, the silence made some scenes so slow, so boring. And why all the racial references? Just not needed! Skip the waste of 2hrs.

    Please spare me this clich&eacute;: the tragedies of a shell-shocked veteran who comes back to his inner city neighborhood and has trouble finding work, his disillusion with the American dream, and how joining the military was the worst decision he ever made. That I could handle, (because I've seen it a million times), but all that nonsense at the end about "how dare you lock me up, after all I did for this country", spoken by a cop-killer? The Black Panthers are portrayed as strong and justified, when really they were a bunch of jabbering radicals who couldn't grow out of their teenage rebellion. The main character was not screwed by "the man" or "the system", he was just psychotic. A lot of men came back from Vietnam and many were troubled, but most did not hit their wives or robbed armored cars.

    when I first bought the movie I had no idea that it had to do with soldiers coming back from Vietnam. I thought it was just another run of the mill bank robbery movie , with our villains dressing up as dead president't ala Point Break. wrong,, my bad.. so it was interesting to see what the effects of the war brought on these 4 gentleman who come back from Vietnam with obvious pain and mental issues to deal with, besides the fact that they are back in society now , and not in the jungle anymore, they have to deal with wives. family, jobs, finances, how to live in society, well for the most part it get's the better of all of these gentleman one by one,, I did like the robbery scene very much,, the action was good, the pacing wasn't too bad. and I will have to give this movie another look and see in the near future.

    A young black man Anthony Curtis is about to graduate from college in 1969 and volunteers from the United States Marine Corps . Coming home after a tour in the early 1970s . Needing a focus in life Anthony finds himself being drawn in to a life of crime DEAD PRESIDENTS was released in 1995 with a fair amount of hype . Directed by the Hughes brothers it was marketed as a film that marketed the black experience of coming home after Vietnam . One can understand why the film was marketed this way since the Hughes did make the critically acclaimed MENACE II SOCIETY , part of a short lived but acclaimed " Ghetto subgenre " in the early 1990s . DEAD PRESIDENTS might try to fit in to this type of genre but what ever type of movie it's trying to be it fails because there's an obvious flaw - there's not one single likable character in the movie If the Hughes brothers had been white I'm sure they'd have been accused of playing up to ethnic stereotypes or at the very least making a blacksplotation movie twenty years too late . The film starts with some foul mouthed characters lamenting the lack of sex in their lives and goes downhill from there . The film then cuts to Vietnam and if Anthnoy ( And the audience ) thought the ghetto was bad then Vietnam is a lot worse . The war scenes are genuinely disturbing and violent but again this seems very old hat when we'd already had a glut of anti-war films featuring the 'Nam ten years earlier and most of them making an anti-war point much better too . When Anthony returns to America he gets involved in a robbery that makes the Vietnam war look like an episode of TELETUBBIES This is a muddled , unfocused violent film that becomes more and more depressing as it goes along . If the Hughes are making a comment that returning soldiers from conflicts regardless of their colour are callously ignored by the country they fought to defend then they have failed . There's little incitement for the characters to become the violent ruthless criminals they are . Just because an educated college boy fought in a war zone it never seems a convincing character motivation to become a criminal , and the robbery itself on an armoured car is done so graphically and violently is enough to evaporate any potential sympathy one might have had at Anthony's plight Despite being a competently made film , the editing is very good for example , DEAD PRESIDENTS is a classic example of a film having to elicit empathy from the audience and if it fails to do this then the entire film fails

    OK to start off I really liked this movie, it isn't amazing or anything like that but is certainly under appreciated at the least. This film may have not have depicted the Vietnam war correctly or it did. But, the film is made for entertainment purposes not to give you an education. This movie deserved some kind of an Oscar for anything. However, I suppose there is a certain group out there just like every movie has and that is the group who dislikes the movie. I haven't gone through the reviews yet but I'm sure there is someone out there who wrote a review and ended up being ridiculous in some way. Well if you haven't seen it yet I suggest you watch it and post what you think as a review.

    "We are being asked to take even larger doses of a medicine that has proved to be deadly and to undertake commitments that do not solve the problem, but only temporarily postpone the foretold death of our economy." - Hieronymos II (head of Greece's Orthodox Church) "A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defence than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual doom." - Martin Luther King, Jr "Austerity is difficult, absolutely, but it's necessary, for rich and poor alike, black and white." - Frank Campbell "The more things change, the more they stay the same." - Jean Baptiste Karr Albert and Allen Hughes direct "Dead Presidents" and "Menace 2 Society". Both films purport to be "serious" examinations of the trials and tribulations of post-Vietnam African Americans, but in reality function more as giant exploitation films. The influence here is Scorsese's "Goodfellas", which the young Hughes brothers  the perfect age to be seduced by Scorsese's pyrotechnics - attempt to mimic blow for blow. And like Scorsese's film, though absent of his considerable style, the Hughes' work here is thin, melodramatic and sensationalistic, with deaths, screams, headshots, bombast, snorting, swearing and fury schematically rolled out to shock, bludgeon and titillate rather than edify. An entire resurgence in African American film-making would be corrupted in the early 1990s with such films. "This is how it really was," the brothers would claim in interviews, positing their early films as a response to John Singleton's (underrated) "Boyz n the Hood". Their films, the brothers claimed, portrayed the reality behind Singleton's supposedly "rosy" portrayal of the African American experience. But time has been unkind to their pictures. And as the baseline for what constitutes "realism" constantly moves, today "Dead Presidents" and "Menace to Society", once touted as being a form of "black neorealism" or "black naturalism", seem hilariously overcooked and gratuitous. And as with all these films, there is little understanding of why our cast of African Americans do what they do, behave how they behave or examination of the power structures and psycho-socio-economic forces at work. (Both films essentially boil down to blacks killing for money; but "economics" is itself the cause of "the problem", stretching all the way from Vietnam to the Slave Trade to the Roman Empire) Still, there are good moments scattered about. "Menace to Society" opens with its best scene, an impromptu robbery/massacre in which a couple of black kids shockingly gun down the Asian shop-workers who insulted them. If disrespect is the root of all violence, we see that here, the larger marginalization of, or systemic disrespect toward, African Americans breeding both feelings of unworthiness and its opposite, a kind of manic need to protect, sometimes violently, brutalized egos. Black culture may have been mocked in the 90s for its "bling", its hysterical materialism, but this, as well as the numerous riots which rocketed across the US in the early 90s, was an understandable "response" to both widespread feelings of neglect and a culture with conflates wealth and worth. One should not have to prove one's humanity, one's worthiness, and when one is constantly forced to do so, pressure builds and one sometimes snaps. What's pertinent about "Menace's" "snaps" is that the victim's of such black aggression are always minorities or other blacks. Meanwhile, white faces are absent from the picture. Society functions in a similar way, Power deflecting hate away from itself  "down" the "social hierarchy" - and onto others. Unfortunately the rest of the picture degenerates into gratuitous gore and violence. Better than "Menace" is "Dead Presidents", which opens in 1968 and attempts to charter the lives of three friends (played by Larenz Tate, Chris Tucker, and Freddy Rodriguez) from the Bronx. They fight in Vietnam, are abandoned by the state, struggle to make a living, battle addiction and are then drawn to a life of crime. Like "Menance", "Presidents" at time shows traces of political savvy  one of the guards killed during the robbery is himself a Vietnam vet - but sensationalism, cynically employed shocks and thriller set pieces eventually undermine claims to earnestness. Blame Scorsese for this. Singleton's "Boyz n the Hood" was released before "Goodfellas" and so is stylistically somewhat different from most "African American" films of the period. 5/10  Worth one viewing.

    That's the main point that stood out for me in this movie.Still a teenager the draft called me and some of my homies,some of them went to Nam.First and second hand I've known the vast majority of persons that went there went through changes.The brutality in this movie reflected some of the experiences I heard about.Many men don't recover from it,a lot are around us and are misunderstood.Some persons may have a different opinion about war after viewing this movie.That was the strong point for me about this movie.This review comes from a person that might of talked about World War II with their Uncle but his body was never sent back.

    The first time I heard about this movie was when I was reading this in a magazine in spring of 1995 and I was 15 years old at that time, Which had a photo of actor Lawance with his face painted white w black lips which was the famous trade mark of this film. it was also used another movie called Half Baked. But I did barrow this movie from the local library 4 years later when it was on video. Dvds weren't popular yet until the next year. What can I say about this film. The cast was great, Same with the acting. But the violence in this film was intense. After you watch this movie for the first time, you can tell that this movie is not for everyone. Maybe for those who come from a tough nabor gang. Nc-17 was the original rating for this film. But I don't think that the violent, the langued and the drug used weren't closed enough for this film. But if you want to watch a better drama with a black cast in it. Do the right thing is the best one. Now the best and only thing about this film is the movie soundtrack. The soundtrack has the best 1970s Smooth soul hits from such great soul artist like Arthia Franklin, Curtis Mayfeld, Al Green, The O Jays, Issic Hays and Many more.

    That's the main point that stood out for me in this movie.Still a teenager the draft called me and some of my homies,some of them went to Nam.First and second hand I've known the vast majority of persons that went there went through changes.The brutality in this movie reflected some of the experiences I heard about.Many men don't recover from it,a lot are around us and are misunderstood.Some persons may have a different opinion about war after viewing this movie.That was the strong point for me about this movie.This review comes from a person that might of talked about World War II with their Uncle but his body was never sent back.

    The first time I heard about this movie was when I was reading this in a magazine in spring of 1995 and I was 15 years old at that time, Which had a photo of actor Lawance with his face painted white w black lips which was the famous trade mark of this film. it was also used another movie called Half Baked. But I did barrow this movie from the local library 4 years later when it was on video. Dvds weren't popular yet until the next year. What can I say about this film. The cast was great, Same with the acting. But the violence in this film was intense. After you watch this movie for the first time, you can tell that this movie is not for everyone. Maybe for those who come from a tough nabor gang. Nc-17 was the original rating for this film. But I don't think that the violent, the langued and the drug used weren't closed enough for this film. But if you want to watch a better drama with a black cast in it. Do the right thing is the best one. Now the best and only thing about this film is the movie soundtrack. The soundtrack has the best 1970s Smooth soul hits from such great soul artist like Arthia Franklin, Curtis Mayfeld, Al Green, The O Jays, Issic Hays and Many more.

    I re-watched this for the first time in over 7 years as I dug it out of my VHS collection. Solid socio-political time peace addressing the issues facing young men growing up in the Bronx during the 70's. Good cast with a firm performance by Larenz Tate in the lead role. The movie showcased three distinct times in the lives of the main character, pre war, during Vietnam and post war struggling with life back in society. Good supporting cast with some noteworthy performances by Bookeem Woodbine, Clifton Powell, N'Bushe Wright and Terrance Howard. Howard steals a few scenes in his small role. Chris Tucker was funny with his usual flamboyant, loud and quick witted character that he has since built a solid career on. The ending was moving and powerful and the movie moved along fairly well accept for a scene or two. The soundtrack was fantastic and had me moving in my chair the whole time, worked excellent with the scenes, mood and period of the film. Well worth the watch.

    I think my disappointment for this film is based partially on the hype of a well known UK film journalist who talked of this as a 'must see movie.' So expectations were high but when the credits rolled on at the end I wondered what on earth was so special about the film. The plot was predictable and with so many short scenes there was little time for atmosphere which left the funk and soul heavy sound track to work overtime. I would align this film with Forest Gump in its attempts to show a young man growing up. Weaving adolescence, romance, violence and adventure into the story. This is the most slight reference since the two films qualities are markedly different. Not a single character in Dead Presidents incites any reaction from the audience. The scripts plausibility is questionable in many places, chasms of time are treated as though they have been emotionally filled in. Characters act out their two dimensional emotions towards these situations to move seamlessly onwards. If you feel sympathy for the lead character to begin with once it is revealed he comes from a loving supportive family this is quashed. I don't think you can identify with a character who throws away so much due to arrogance and selfish pride. So if this is the case what where the directors trying to say about this mans life? Nothing in the film allowed us to be enlightened. I wouldn't recommend this film but then I like films which have a depth and are written in a more considered way.

    This movie is just a total waste of time. I'm telling you DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. Terrible Acting, I mean Chris Tucker??? This guy is just horrible. The slowness of this film isn't the only issue I have with it, the directing is awful. Take for example the scenes in Vietnam - how predictable were they??? The camera angles were done by a first time director. The scene at the butcher shop - look how immature this scene really is. Are the people walking by robots? Its as if they tried to over direct them. Scene when girl first meets him her father (Anthony) - is she a Zombie? Its like a 1970s film where they used a puppet to get the child actor's attention. And when he is having nightmares - What the HELL!! OK and last 2 rips: Absolutely needed more music in the background, the silence made some scenes so slow, so boring. And why all the racial references? Just not needed! Skip the waste of 2hrs.

    Please spare me this clich&eacute;: the tragedies of a shell-shocked veteran who comes back to his inner city neighborhood and has trouble finding work, his disillusion with the American dream, and how joining the military was the worst decision he ever made. That I could handle, (because I've seen it a million times), but all that nonsense at the end about "how dare you lock me up, after all I did for this country", spoken by a cop-killer? The Black Panthers are portrayed as strong and justified, when really they were a bunch of jabbering radicals who couldn't grow out of their teenage rebellion. The main character was not screwed by "the man" or "the system", he was just psychotic. A lot of men came back from Vietnam and many were troubled, but most did not hit their wives or robbed armored cars.

    when I first bought the movie I had no idea that it had to do with soldiers coming back from Vietnam. I thought it was just another run of the mill bank robbery movie , with our villains dressing up as dead president't ala Point Break. wrong,, my bad.. so it was interesting to see what the effects of the war brought on these 4 gentleman who come back from Vietnam with obvious pain and mental issues to deal with, besides the fact that they are back in society now , and not in the jungle anymore, they have to deal with wives. family, jobs, finances, how to live in society, well for the most part it get's the better of all of these gentleman one by one,, I did like the robbery scene very much,, the action was good, the pacing wasn't too bad. and I will have to give this movie another look and see in the near future.

    A young black man Anthony Curtis is about to graduate from college in 1969 and volunteers from the United States Marine Corps . Coming home after a tour in the early 1970s . Needing a focus in life Anthony finds himself being drawn in to a life of crime DEAD PRESIDENTS was released in 1995 with a fair amount of hype . Directed by the Hughes brothers it was marketed as a film that marketed the black experience of coming home after Vietnam . One can understand why the film was marketed this way since the Hughes did make the critically acclaimed MENACE II SOCIETY , part of a short lived but acclaimed " Ghetto subgenre " in the early 1990s . DEAD PRESIDENTS might try to fit in to this type of genre but what ever type of movie it's trying to be it fails because there's an obvious flaw - there's not one single likable character in the movie If the Hughes brothers had been white I'm sure they'd have been accused of playing up to ethnic stereotypes or at the very least making a blacksplotation movie twenty years too late . The film starts with some foul mouthed characters lamenting the lack of sex in their lives and goes downhill from there . The film then cuts to Vietnam and if Anthnoy ( And the audience ) thought the ghetto was bad then Vietnam is a lot worse . The war scenes are genuinely disturbing and violent but again this seems very old hat when we'd already had a glut of anti-war films featuring the 'Nam ten years earlier and most of them making an anti-war point much better too . When Anthony returns to America he gets involved in a robbery that makes the Vietnam war look like an episode of TELETUBBIES This is a muddled , unfocused violent film that becomes more and more depressing as it goes along . If the Hughes are making a comment that returning soldiers from conflicts regardless of their colour are callously ignored by the country they fought to defend then they have failed . There's little incitement for the characters to become the violent ruthless criminals they are . Just because an educated college boy fought in a war zone it never seems a convincing character motivation to become a criminal , and the robbery itself on an armoured car is done so graphically and violently is enough to evaporate any potential sympathy one might have had at Anthony's plight Despite being a competently made film , the editing is very good for example , DEAD PRESIDENTS is a classic example of a film having to elicit empathy from the audience and if it fails to do this then the entire film fails

    OK to start off I really liked this movie, it isn't amazing or anything like that but is certainly under appreciated at the least. This film may have not have depicted the Vietnam war correctly or it did. But, the film is made for entertainment purposes not to give you an education. This movie deserved some kind of an Oscar for anything. However, I suppose there is a certain group out there just like every movie has and that is the group who dislikes the movie. I haven't gone through the reviews yet but I'm sure there is someone out there who wrote a review and ended up being ridiculous in some way. Well if you haven't seen it yet I suggest you watch it and post what you think as a review.

    "We are being asked to take even larger doses of a medicine that has proved to be deadly and to undertake commitments that do not solve the problem, but only temporarily postpone the foretold death of our economy." - Hieronymos II (head of Greece's Orthodox Church) "A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defence than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual doom." - Martin Luther King, Jr "Austerity is difficult, absolutely, but it's necessary, for rich and poor alike, black and white." - Frank Campbell "The more things change, the more they stay the same." - Jean Baptiste Karr Albert and Allen Hughes direct "Dead Presidents" and "Menace 2 Society". Both films purport to be "serious" examinations of the trials and tribulations of post-Vietnam African Americans, but in reality function more as giant exploitation films. The influence here is Scorsese's "Goodfellas", which the young Hughes brothers  the perfect age to be seduced by Scorsese's pyrotechnics - attempt to mimic blow for blow. And like Scorsese's film, though absent of his considerable style, the Hughes' work here is thin, melodramatic and sensationalistic, with deaths, screams, headshots, bombast, snorting, swearing and fury schematically rolled out to shock, bludgeon and titillate rather than edify. An entire resurgence in African American film-making would be corrupted in the early 1990s with such films. "This is how it really was," the brothers would claim in interviews, positing their early films as a response to John Singleton's (underrated) "Boyz n the Hood". Their films, the brothers claimed, portrayed the reality behind Singleton's supposedly "rosy" portrayal of the African American experience. But time has been unkind to their pictures. And as the baseline for what constitutes "realism" constantly moves, today "Dead Presidents" and "Menace to Society", once touted as being a form of "black neorealism" or "black naturalism", seem hilariously overcooked and gratuitous. And as with all these films, there is little understanding of why our cast of African Americans do what they do, behave how they behave or examination of the power structures and psycho-socio-economic forces at work. (Both films essentially boil down to blacks killing for money; but "economics" is itself the cause of "the problem", stretching all the way from Vietnam to the Slave Trade to the Roman Empire) Still, there are good moments scattered about. "Menace to Society" opens with its best scene, an impromptu robbery/massacre in which a couple of black kids shockingly gun down the Asian shop-workers who insulted them. If disrespect is the root of all violence, we see that here, the larger marginalization of, or systemic disrespect toward, African Americans breeding both feelings of unworthiness and its opposite, a kind of manic need to protect, sometimes violently, brutalized egos. Black culture may have been mocked in the 90s for its "bling", its hysterical materialism, but this, as well as the numerous riots which rocketed across the US in the early 90s, was an understandable "response" to both widespread feelings of neglect and a culture with conflates wealth and worth. One should not have to prove one's humanity, one's worthiness, and when one is constantly forced to do so, pressure builds and one sometimes snaps. What's pertinent about "Menace's" "snaps" is that the victim's of such black aggression are always minorities or other blacks. Meanwhile, white faces are absent from the picture. Society functions in a similar way, Power deflecting hate away from itself  "down" the "social hierarchy" - and onto others. Unfortunately the rest of the picture degenerates into gratuitous gore and violence. Better than "Menace" is "Dead Presidents", which opens in 1968 and attempts to charter the lives of three friends (played by Larenz Tate, Chris Tucker, and Freddy Rodriguez) from the Bronx. They fight in Vietnam, are abandoned by the state, struggle to make a living, battle addiction and are then drawn to a life of crime. Like "Menance", "Presidents" at time shows traces of political savvy  one of the guards killed during the robbery is himself a Vietnam vet - but sensationalism, cynically employed shocks and thriller set pieces eventually undermine claims to earnestness. Blame Scorsese for this. Singleton's "Boyz n the Hood" was released before "Goodfellas" and so is stylistically somewhat different from most "African American" films of the period. 5/10  Worth one viewing.

    The first time I heard about this movie was when I was reading this in a magazine in spring of 1995 and I was 15 years old at that time, Which had a photo of actor Lawance with his face painted white w black lips which was the famous trade mark of this film. it was also used another movie called Half Baked. But I did barrow this movie from the local library 4 years later when it was on video. Dvds weren't popular yet until the next year. What can I say about this film. The cast was great, Same with the acting. But the violence in this film was intense. After you watch this movie for the first time, you can tell that this movie is not for everyone. Maybe for those who come from a tough nabor gang. Nc-17 was the original rating for this film. But I don't think that the violent, the langued and the drug used weren't closed enough for this film. But if you want to watch a better drama with a black cast in it. Do the right thing is the best one. Now the best and only thing about this film is the movie soundtrack.

(Both films essentially boil down to blacks killing for money; but "economics" is itself the cause of "the problem", stretching all the way from Vietnam to the Slave Trade to the Roman Empire) Still, there are good moments scattered about. "Menace to Society" opens with its best scene, an impromptu robbery/massacre in which a couple of black kids shockingly gun down the Asian shop-workers who insulted them. If disrespect is the root of all violence, we see that here, the larger marginalization of, or systemic disrespect toward, African Americans breeding both feelings of unworthiness and its opposite, a kind of manic need to protect, sometimes violently, brutalized egos. Black culture may have been mocked in the 90s for its "bling", its hysterical materialism, but this, as well as the numerous riots which rocketed across the US in the early 90s, was an understandable "response" to both widespread feelings of neglect and a culture with conflates wealth and worth. One should not have to prove one's humanity, one's worthiness, and when one is constantly forced to do so, pressure builds and one sometimes snaps. What's pertinent about "Menace's" "snaps" is that the victim's of such black aggression are always minorities or other blacks. Meanwhile, white faces are absent from the picture. Society functions in a similar way, Power deflecting hate away from itself  "down" the "social hierarchy" - and onto others. Unfortunately the rest of the picture degenerates into gratuitous gore and violence. Better than "Menace" is "Dead Presidents", which opens in 1968 and attempts to charter the lives of three friends (played by Larenz Tate, Chris Tucker, and Freddy Rodriguez) from the Bronx. They fight in Vietnam, are abandoned by the state, struggle to make a living, battle addiction and are then drawn to a life of crime. Like "Menance", "Presidents" at time shows traces of political savvy  one of the guards killed during the robbery is himself a Vietnam vet - but sensationalism, cynically employed shocks and thriller set pieces eventually undermine claims to earnestness. Blame Scorsese for this. Singleton's "Boyz n the Hood" was released before "Goodfellas" and so is stylistically somewhat different from most "African American" films of the period. 5/10  Worth one viewing.

    That's the main point that stood out for me in this movie.Still a teenager the draft called me and some of my homies,some of them went to Nam.First and second hand I've known the vast majority of persons that went there went through changes.The brutality in this movie reflected some of the experiences I heard about.Many men don't recover from it,a lot are around us and are misunderstood.Some persons may have a different opinion about war after viewing this movie.That was the strong point for me about this movie.This review comes from a person that might of talked about World War II with their Uncle but his body was never sent back.

    The first time I heard about this movie was when I was reading this in a magazine in spring of 1995 and I was 15 years old at that time, Which had a photo of actor Lawance with his face painted white w black lips which was the famous trade mark of this film. it was also used another movie called Half Baked. But I did barrow this movie from the local library 4 years later when it was on video. Dvds weren't popular yet until the next year. What can I say about this film. The cast was great, Same with the acting. But the violence in this film was intense. After you watch this movie for the first time, you can tell that this movie is not for everyone. Maybe for those who come from a tough nabor gang. Nc-17 was the original rating for this film. But I don't think that the violent, the langued and the drug used weren't closed enough for this film. But if you want to watch a better drama with a black cast in it. Do the right thing is the best one. Now the best and only thing about this film is the movie soundtrack. The soundtrack has the best 1970s Smooth soul hits from such great soul artist like Arthia Franklin, Curtis Mayfeld, Al Green, The O Jays, Issic Hays and Many more.

    I re-watched this for the first time in over 7 years as I dug it out of my VHS collection. Solid socio-political time peace addressing the issues facing young men growing up in the Bronx during the 70's. Good cast with a firm performance by Larenz Tate in the lead role. The movie showcased three distinct times in the lives of the main character, pre war, during Vietnam and post war struggling with life back in society. Good supporting cast with some noteworthy performances by Bookeem Woodbine, Clifton Powell, N'Bushe Wright and Terrance Howard. Howard steals a few scenes in his small role. Chris Tucker was funny with his usual flamboyant, loud and quick witted character that he has since built a solid career on. The ending was moving and powerful and the movie moved along fairly well accept for a scene or two. The soundtrack was fantastic and had me moving in my chair the whole time, worked excellent with the scenes, mood and period of the film. Well worth the watch.

    I think my disappointment for this film is based partially on the hype of a well known UK film journalist who talked of this as a 'must see movie.' So expectations were high but when the credits rolled on at the end I wondered what on earth was so special about the film. The plot was predictable and with so many short scenes there was little time for atmosphere which left the funk and soul heavy sound track to work overtime. I would align this film with Forest Gump in its attempts to show a young man growing up. Weaving adolescence, romance, violence and adventure into the story. This is the most slight reference since the two films qualities are markedly different. Not a single character in Dead Presidents incites any reaction from the audience. The scripts plausibility is questionable in many places, chasms of time are treated as though they have been emotionally filled in. Characters act out their two dimensional emotions towards these situations to move seamlessly onwards. If you feel sympathy for the lead character to begin with once it is revealed he comes from a loving supportive family this is quashed. I don't think you can identify with a character who throws away so much due to arrogance and selfish pride. So if this is the case what where the directors trying to say about this mans life? Nothing in the film allowed us to be enlightened. I wouldn't recommend this film but then I like films which have a depth and are written in a more considered way.

    This movie is just a total waste of time. I'm telling you DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. Terrible Acting, I mean Chris Tucker??? This guy is just horrible. The slowness of this film isn't the only issue I have with it, the directing is awful. Take for example the scenes in Vietnam - how predictable were they??? The camera angles were done by a first time director. The scene at the butcher shop - look how immature this scene really is. Are the people walking by robots? Its as if they tried to over direct them. Scene when girl first meets him her father (Anthony) - is she a Zombie? Its like a 1970s film where they used a puppet to get the child actor's attention. And when he is having nightmares - What the HELL!! OK and last 2 rips: Absolutely needed more music in the background, the silence made some scenes so slow, so boring. And why all the racial references? Just not needed! Skip the waste of 2hrs.

    Please spare me this clich&eacute;: the tragedies of a shell-shocked veteran who comes back to his inner city neighborhood and has trouble finding work, his disillusion with the American dream, and how joining the military was the worst decision he ever made. That I could handle, (because I've seen it a million times), but all that nonsense at the end about "how dare you lock me up, after all I did for this country", spoken by a cop-killer? The Black Panthers are portrayed as strong and justified, when really they were a bunch of jabbering radicals who couldn't grow out of their teenage rebellion. The main character was not screwed by "the man" or "the system", he was just psychotic. A lot of men came back from Vietnam and many were troubled, but most did not hit their wives or robbed armored cars.

    when I first bought the movie I had no idea that it had to do with soldiers coming back from Vietnam. I thought it was just another run of the mill bank robbery movie , with our villains dressing up as dead president't ala Point Break. wrong,, my bad.. so it was interesting to see what the effects of the war brought on these 4 gentleman who come back from Vietnam with obvious pain and mental issues to deal with, besides the fact that they are back in society now , and not in the jungle anymore, they have to deal with wives. family, jobs, finances, how to live in society, well for the most part it get's the better of all of these gentleman one by one,, I did like the robbery scene very much,, the action was good, the pacing wasn't too bad. and I will have to give this movie another look and see in the near future.

    A young black man Anthony Curtis is about to graduate from college in 1969 and volunteers from the United States Marine Corps . Coming home after a tour in the early 1970s . Needing a focus in life Anthony finds himself being drawn in to a life of crime DEAD PRESIDENTS was released in 1995 with a fair amount of hype . Directed by the Hughes brothers it was marketed as a film that marketed the black experience of coming home after Vietnam . One can understand why the film was marketed this way since the Hughes did make the critically acclaimed MENACE II SOCIETY , part of a short lived but acclaimed " Ghetto subgenre " in the early 1990s . DEAD PRESIDENTS might try to fit in to this type of genre but what ever type of movie it's trying to be it fails because there's an obvious flaw - there's not one single likable character in the movie If the Hughes brothers had been white I'm sure they'd have been accused of playing up to ethnic stereotypes or at the very least making a blacksplotation movie twenty years too late . The film starts with some foul mouthed characters lamenting the lack of sex in their lives and goes downhill from there . The film then cuts to Vietnam and if Anthnoy ( And the audience ) thought the ghetto was bad then Vietnam is a lot worse . The war scenes are genuinely disturbing and violent but again this seems very old hat when we'd already had a glut of anti-war films featuring the 'Nam ten years earlier and most of them making an anti-war point much better too . When Anthony returns to America he gets involved in a robbery that makes the Vietnam war look like an episode of TELETUBBIES This is a muddled , unfocused violent film that becomes more and more depressing as it goes along . If the Hughes are making a comment that returning soldiers from conflicts regardless of their colour are callously ignored by the country they fought to defend then they have failed . There's little incitement for the characters to become the violent ruthless criminals they are . Just because an educated college boy fought in a war zone it never seems a convincing character motivation to become a criminal , and the robbery itself on an armoured car is done so graphically and violently is enough to evaporate any potential sympathy one might have had at Anthony's plight Despite being a competently made film , the editing is very good for example , DEAD PRESIDENTS is a classic example of a film having to elicit empathy from the audience and if it fails to do this then the entire film fails

    OK to start off I really liked this movie, it isn't amazing or anything like that but is certainly under appreciated at the least. This film may have not have depicted the Vietnam war correctly or it did. But, the film is made for entertainment purposes not to give you an education. This movie deserved some kind of an Oscar for anything. However, I suppose there is a certain group out there just like every movie has and that is the group who dislikes the movie. I haven't gone through the reviews yet but I'm sure there is someone out there who wrote a review and ended up being ridiculous in some way. Well if you haven't seen it yet I suggest you watch it and post what you think as a review.

    "We are being asked to take even larger doses of a medicine that has proved to be deadly and to undertake commitments that do not solve the problem, but only temporarily postpone the foretold death of our economy." - Hieronymos II (head of Greece's Orthodox Church) "A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defence than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual doom." - Martin Luther King, Jr "Austerity is difficult, absolutely, but it's necessary, for rich and poor alike, black and white." - Frank Campbell "The more things change, the more they stay the same." - Jean Baptiste Karr Albert and Allen Hughes direct "Dead Presidents" and "Menace 2 Society". Both films purport to be "serious" examinations of the trials and tribulations of post-Vietnam African Americans, but in reality function more as giant exploitation films. The influence here is Scorsese's "Goodfellas", which the young Hughes brothers  the perfect age to be seduced by Scorsese's pyrotechnics - attempt to mimic blow for blow. And like Scorsese's film, though absent of his considerable style, the Hughes' work here is thin, melodramatic and sensationalistic, with deaths, screams, headshots, bombast, snorting, swearing and fury schematically rolled out to shock, bludgeon and titillate rather than edify. An entire resurgence in African American film-making would be corrupted in the early 1990s with such films. "This is how it really was," the brothers would claim in interviews, positing their early films as a response to John Singleton's (underrated) "Boyz n the Hood". Their films, the brothers claimed, portrayed the reality behind Singleton's supposedly "rosy" portrayal of the African American experience. But time has been unkind to their pictures. And as the baseline for what constitutes "realism" constantly moves, today "Dead Presidents" and "Menace to Society", once touted as being a form of "black neorealism" or "black naturalism", seem hilariously overcooked and gratuitous. And as with all these films, there is little understanding of why our cast of African Americans do what they do, behave how they behave or examination of the power structures and psycho-socio-economic forces at work. (Both films essentially boil down to blacks killing for money; but "economics" is itself the cause of "the problem", stretching all the way from Vietnam to the Slave Trade to the Roman Empire) Still, there are good moments scattered about. "Menace to Society" opens with its best scene, an impromptu robbery/massacre in which a couple of black kids shockingly gun down the Asian shop-workers who insulted them. If disrespect is the root of all violence, we see that here, the larger marginalization of, or systemic disrespect toward, African Americans breeding both feelings of unworthiness and its opposite, a kind of manic need to protect, sometimes violently, brutalized egos. Black culture may have been mocked in the 90s for its "bling", its hysterical materialism, but this, as well as the numerous riots which rocketed across the US in the early 90s, was an understandable "response" to both widespread feelings of neglect and a culture with conflates wealth and worth. One should not have to prove one's humanity, one's worthiness, and when one is constantly forced to do so, pressure builds and one sometimes snaps. What's pertinent about "Menace's" "snaps" is that the victim's of such black aggression are always minorities or other blacks. Meanwhile, white faces are absent from the picture. Society functions in a similar way, Power deflecting hate away from itself  "down" the "social hierarchy" - and onto others. Unfortunately the rest of the picture degenerates into gratuitous gore and violence. Better than "Menace" is "Dead Presidents", which opens in 1968 and attempts to charter the lives of three friends (played by Larenz Tate, Chris Tucker, and Freddy Rodriguez) from the Bronx. They fight in Vietnam, are abandoned by the state, struggle to make a living, battle addiction and are then drawn to a life of crime. Like "Menance", "Presidents" at time shows traces of political savvy  one of the guards killed during the robbery is himself a Vietnam vet - but sensationalism, cynically employed shocks and thriller set pieces eventually undermine claims to earnestness. Blame Scorsese for this. Singleton's "Boyz n the Hood" was released before "Goodfellas" and so is stylistically somewhat different from most "African American" films of the period. 5/10  Worth one viewing.

This film may have not have depicted the Vietnam war correctly or it did. But, the film is made for entertainment purposes not to give you an education. This movie deserved some kind of an Oscar for anything. However, I suppose there is a certain group out there just like every movie has and that is the group who dislikes the movie. I haven't gone through the reviews yet but I'm sure there is someone out there who wrote a review and ended up being ridiculous in some way. Well if you haven't seen it yet I suggest you watch it and post what you think as a review.

    "We are being asked to take even larger doses of a medicine that has proved to be deadly and to undertake commitments that do not solve the problem, but only temporarily postpone the foretold death of our economy." - Hieronymos II (head of Greece's Orthodox Church) "A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defence than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual doom." - Martin Luther King, Jr "Austerity is difficult, absolutely, but it's necessary, for rich and poor alike, black and white." - Frank Campbell "The more things change, the more they stay the same." - Jean Baptiste Karr Albert and Allen Hughes direct "Dead Presidents" and "Menace 2 Society". Both films purport to be "serious" examinations of the trials and tribulations of post-Vietnam African Americans, but in reality function more as giant exploitation films. The influence here is Scorsese's "Goodfellas", which the young Hughes brothers  the perfect age to be seduced by Scorsese's pyrotechnics - attempt to mimic blow for blow. And like Scorsese's film, though absent of his considerable style, the Hughes' work here is thin, melodramatic and sensationalistic, with deaths, screams, headshots, bombast, snorting, swearing and fury schematically rolled out to shock, bludgeon and titillate rather than edify. An entire resurgence in African American film-making would be corrupted in the early 1990s with such films. "This is how it really was," the brothers would claim in interviews, positing their early films as a response to John Singleton's (underrated) "Boyz n the Hood". Their films, the brothers claimed, portrayed the reality behind Singleton's supposedly "rosy" portrayal of the African American experience. But time has been unkind to their pictures. And as the baseline for what constitutes "realism" constantly moves, today "Dead Presidents" and "Menace to Society", once touted as being a form of "black neorealism" or "black naturalism", seem hilariously overcooked and gratuitous. And as with all these films, there is little understanding of why our cast of African Americans do what they do, behave how they behave or examination of the power structures and psycho-socio-economic forces at work. (Both films essentially boil down to blacks killing for money; but "economics" is itself the cause of "the problem", stretching all the way from Vietnam to the Slave Trade to the Roman Empire) Still, there are good moments scattered about. "Menace to Society" opens with its best scene, an impromptu robbery/massacre in which a couple of black kids shockingly gun down the Asian shop-workers who insulted them. If disrespect is the root of all violence, we see that here, the larger marginalization of, or systemic disrespect toward, African Americans breeding both feelings of unworthiness and its opposite, a kind of manic need to protect, sometimes violently, brutalized egos. Black culture may have been mocked in the 90s for its "bling", its hysterical materialism, but this, as well as the numerous riots which rocketed across the US in the early 90s, was an understandable "response" to both widespread feelings of neglect and a culture with conflates wealth and worth. One should not have to prove one's humanity, one's worthiness, and when one is constantly forced to do so, pressure builds and one sometimes snaps. What's pertinent about "Menace's" "snaps" is that the victim's of such black aggression are always minorities or other blacks. Meanwhile, white faces are absent from the picture. Society functions in a similar way, Power deflecting hate away from itself  "down" the "social hierarchy" - and onto others. Unfortunately the rest of the picture degenerates into gratuitous gore and violence. Better than "Menace" is "Dead Presidents", which opens in 1968 and attempts to charter the lives of three friends (played by Larenz Tate, Chris Tucker, and Freddy Rodriguez) from the Bronx. They fight in Vietnam, are abandoned by the state, struggle to make a living, battle addiction and are then drawn to a life of crime. Like "Menance", "Presidents" at time shows traces of political savvy  one of the guards killed during the robbery is himself a Vietnam vet - but sensationalism, cynically employed shocks and thriller set pieces eventually undermine claims to earnestness. Blame Scorsese for this. Singleton's "Boyz n the Hood" was released before "Goodfellas" and so is stylistically somewhat different from most "African American" films of the period. 5/10  Worth one viewing.

    That's the main point that stood out for me in this movie.Still a teenager the draft called me and some of my homies,some of them went to Nam.First and second hand I've known the vast majority of persons that went there went through changes.The brutality in this movie reflected some of the experiences I heard about.Many men don't recover from it,a lot are around us and are misunderstood.Some persons may have a different opinion about war after viewing this movie.That was the strong point for me about this movie.This review comes from a person that might of talked about World War II with their Uncle but his body was never sent back.

    The first time I heard about this movie was when I was reading this in a magazine in spring of 1995 and I was 15 years old at that time, Which had a photo of actor Lawance with his face painted white w black lips which was the famous trade mark of this film. it was also used another movie called Half Baked. But I did barrow this movie from the local library 4 years later when it was on video. Dvds weren't popular yet until the next year. What can I say about this film. The cast was great, Same with the acting. But the violence in this film was intense. After you watch this movie for the first time, you can tell that this movie is not for everyone. Maybe for those who come from a tough nabor gang. Nc-17 was the original rating for this film. But I don't think that the violent, the langued and the drug used weren't closed enough for this film. But if you want to watch a better drama with a black cast in it. Do the right thing is the best one. Now the best and only thing about this film is the movie soundtrack. The soundtrack has the best 1970s Smooth soul hits from such great soul artist like Arthia Franklin, Curtis Mayfeld, Al Green, The O Jays, Issic Hays and Many more.

    I re-watched this for the first time in over 7 years as I dug it out of my VHS collection. Solid socio-political time peace addressing the issues facing young men growing up in the Bronx during the 70's. Good cast with a firm performance by Larenz Tate in the lead role. The movie showcased three distinct times in the lives of the main character, pre war, during Vietnam and post war struggling with life back in society. Good supporting cast with some noteworthy performances by Bookeem Woodbine, Clifton Powell, N'Bushe Wright and Terrance Howard. Howard steals a few scenes in his small role. Chris Tucker was funny with his usual flamboyant, loud and quick witted character that he has since built a solid career on. The ending was moving and powerful and the movie moved along fairly well accept for a scene or two. The soundtrack was fantastic and had me moving in my chair the whole time, worked excellent with the scenes, mood and period of the film. Well worth the watch.

    I think my disappointment for this film is based partially on the hype of a well known UK film journalist who talked of this as a 'must see movie.' So expectations were high but when the credits rolled on at the end I wondered what on earth was so special about the film. The plot was predictable and with so many short scenes there was little time for atmosphere which left the funk and soul heavy sound track to work overtime. I would align this film with Forest Gump in its attempts to show a young man growing up. Weaving adolescence, romance, violence and adventure into the story. This is the most slight reference since the two films qualities are markedly different. Not a single character in Dead Presidents incites any reaction from the audience. The scripts plausibility is questionable in many places, chasms of time are treated as though they have been emotionally filled in. Characters act out their two dimensional emotions towards these situations to move seamlessly onwards. If you feel sympathy for the lead character to begin with once it is revealed he comes from a loving supportive family this is quashed. I don't think you can identify with a character who throws away so much due to arrogance and selfish pride. So if this is the case what where the directors trying to say about this mans life? Nothing in the film allowed us to be enlightened. I wouldn't recommend this film but then I like films which have a depth and are written in a more considered way.

    This movie is just a total waste of time. I'm telling you DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. Terrible Acting, I mean Chris Tucker??? This guy is just horrible. The slowness of this film isn't the only issue I have with it, the directing is awful. Take for example the scenes in Vietnam - how predictable were they??? The camera angles were done by a first time director. The scene at the butcher shop - look how immature this scene really is. Are the people walking by robots? Its as if they tried to over direct them. Scene when girl first meets him her father (Anthony) - is she a Zombie? Its like a 1970s film where they used a puppet to get the child actor's attention. And when he is having nightmares - What the HELL!! OK and last 2 rips: Absolutely needed more music in the background, the silence made some scenes so slow, so boring. And why all the racial references? Just not needed! Skip the waste of 2hrs.

    Please spare me this clich&eacute;: the tragedies of a shell-shocked veteran who comes back to his inner city neighborhood and has trouble finding work, his disillusion with the American dream, and how joining the military was the worst decision he ever made. That I could handle, (because I've seen it a million times), but all that nonsense at the end about "how dare you lock me up, after all I did for this country", spoken by a cop-killer? The Black Panthers are portrayed as strong and justified, when really they were a bunch of jabbering radicals who couldn't grow out of their teenage rebellion. The main character was not screwed by "the man" or "the system", he was just psychotic. A lot of men came back from Vietnam and many were troubled, but most did not hit their wives or robbed armored cars.
