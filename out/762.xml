 <sinopse>
  A piano player at a crossroads in his life returns home to his friends and their own problems with life and love.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  New York based jazz pianist Willie Conway heads back to his small hometown of Knights Ridge, Massachusetts for a high school reunion. The trip is as much to go to the reunion and see his old friends - none of whom left Knights Ridge after graduation - as it is to get away from his current life, at which he is at a crossroads both personally and professionally. He is just eking out a living with his piano playing gigs, and as such he is thinking about taking a sales job. He's also not sure if he's ready to marry his long time girlfriend, lawyer Tracy Stover. Most of Willie's Knights Ridge blue collar friends' best days were in high school, they still having that "trophy" mentality of girlfriends and wives. Only Michael "Mo" Morris is happily married with a family. Paul Kirkwood, whose room is plastered with magazine pictures of models, wants his waitress ex-girlfriend Jan back only because he knows now that he can't have her. And Tommy "Birdman" Rowland, who was the big man in high ...

    Pianist Willie Conway (Timothy Hutton) is going back home for his high school reunion. He isn't making it and is at a crossroads. He finds himself falling for the 13 year old girl next door Marty (Natalie Portman). Many of his friends have stayed in town dealing with their own problems with love and unreasonable expectations. Paul Kirkwood (Michael Rapaport) is a child not satisfied with his girlfriend, still chasing for the next girl, and expounding on the virtues of the Beautiful Girls. There are a lot of memorable scenes. Rosie O'Donnell delivers a diatribe against the illusions of beautiful girls. But it's Natalie Portman who steals the show with a smart old soul. If there's anything, there're too many characters, too many story lines, too many relationships. It dilutes the product. A few less lead characters would be very helpful.

    Beautiful Girls is about Willie Conway,who goes home for his high school class reunion at New England. He is at a crossroads in his life and he can not decide if he should marry his girlfriend.Also,he can not decide if he should quit his music and take a job as a salesman. Over the course of the story, he spends time with his old friends who are all at similar crossroads. By the end they all discover what it is that they want.It stars Matt Dillon, Lauren Holly, Timothy Hutton, Rosie O'Donnell, Martha Plimpton, Natalie Portman, Michael Rapaport, Mira Sorvino, and Uma Thurman.It was directed by Ted Demme. This conversational film is about the gaping chasm between what men say and what they feel. It may not tell us anything new, but its eloquence is quietly rewarding.Nevertheless,it really succeeds with its warm treatment of ordinary hang-ups like no life-shattering revelations or pain repressed since childhood, just the genuine, everyday trials of life.Also,this coming of age tale is about guys in their 20's who refuse or are unable to mature as evidenced by the captivating relationship is between Timothy Hutton and the 13-year-old Natalie Portman,which steals all scenes and it is a delight.This is definitely a smart film about relationships and growing older that's funny and smart that many would surely enjoy.

    This is one of my favorite movies of all time. To expand the meaning of never judge a book by it's cover is such. The title kept me from watching it until a few years ago. When it was over, i hit play and watched it again. This movie is so genuine and heartfelt and real. It's loaded with a great cast and great quotes. "Beautiful girls" is a romantic comedy at heart but not just a chick flick. Guys will also enjoy it. So to anyone who has not seen it yet, i urge you to watch. It will make you laugh and cry but most of all should leave you feeling happy. This movie also has some of the greatest lines i have ever heard in a movie. One of my favorite characters is played by actor "Michael Rappaport." Some of his scenes i have lived by. The soundtrack to this movie is one of the best. So a perfect movie and perfect soundtrack, what more can you ask for?

    Beautiful Girls has a great story line and good characters. The plot is something anyone would be interested and relate to, and it is well acted. I really wish the dialogue were written by someone maybe a little more "earthy." There are some pretty cringe-worthy moments. In trying to capture a feeling of "bro" behavior, some of the dialog rings false, like it was either written by a woman who does not spend a lot of time with these types of men, or a man who does not have these kinds of friends. I know many men like the ones portrayed in the movie: trapped in their own self-defeating fantasies and not particularly successful. If one of them began a conversation like the ones in the film, his friends would think he was speaking in a different language. I know Uma Thurman was cast as the token "beautiful girl" yet some of the lines she said just sounded silly, maybe like contrived intelligent remarks. There are many highly intelligent and precociously funny teens like Natalie Portman, but they would have never said things like "daddy downer and brother bummer." That is the vernacular of a forty year old screenwriter. For a more realistic portrayal of the sharply sarcastic teen, watch Juno. I have taught for years and can see a vast difference in the two characters meant to appeal to older men. "Bros" like these would rather stick a needle in their eye rather than sit around a piano to sing "Sweet Caroline" to a girl they want to impress. Of all the dialogue and scenes, that seems the most artificial and contrived. I wish it were taken out of the film. I also have a few superficial quibbles...the actors do look much too old for a 10 year reunion. I am really ashamed of this particular complaint...but I sort of wish the characters had more 90's era style...to add some nostalgia. No one has any style. Also the soundtrack is horrific. However, it is very watchable overall.

    I was actually dreading to watch this movie since most similar genre movies end up to be melodramatic, preachy and finally sappy. My expectation started to turn out true with an irritating opening song through the credits and character introductions, but like the movie - I couldn't get the song out of my head now. Be it Michael Rapaport's unending bickering and whining, suave looks of Uma Thurman and then a masterstroke in a mature than her age teenager role of Natalie Portman. Adding her performance with 'Leon - The Professional', Natalie Portman is yesteryear's Chloe Mortez - but that is being generous for Chloe. Every serious, melodramatic moment has a fresh twist to make it entertaining, every character superbly defined and stay true to their character till the end. It was all in all an excellent ensemble performance from all involved appraising an equally well written script. Willie (Timothy Hutton) is at a crossroads with his career going nowhere as a musician and his relationship stuck due to his commitment phobia. He decides to comeback to his hometown to attend his high school reunion while catching up on his old friends Tommy (Matt Dillon), Mo (Noah Emmerich) and Paul (Michael Rapaport) each going through different phases in their life and relationships. When Willie thinks nothing could go any worse, he falls for a 13 year old Marty (Natalie Portman). There is a wicked sense of humor here commonly not associated with movies of that era. While the director treasures and elevates some key moments, also tries to keep it a little lighter and borderline quirky. What this movie required was not great performances but spontaneous ones and gets plenty of them from the able cast, especially little Natalie Portman. The background score could have been better except for the irritatingly catchy opening song which is used extensively throughout the movie. There is a little lull somewhere before the last quarter part of the movie, but picks up quite well leading to a predictable yet well executed finish.

    It was fun seeing the "new young acting talent" of 1996 in a way. (Remember the movie "Singles"?) Timothy Hutton and Natalie Portman have the best roles, but these too are one-dimensional and formulaic. If you want to see a much more realistic treatment of these themes please see the obscure independent film "Mulletville." You won't be disappointed. But the script here--ye gods! It has Rosie O'Donnell telling the male characters that "real women" should look like her (!) and that men should quit admiring "supermodels." Would you like a date with Rosie O'? The basic plot of the movie is that young rowdy small-town men need to "give up' their "irresponsible" hell-raising and "settle down" with "realistic" women who don't look very pretty or glamorous.(Including Timothy Hutton's lawyer-girlfriend-- a lawyer girlfriend so "responsible"!) Well--in the economy of the past 10 years--2002-2012 --people do not get to "settle down." --Their lives are too economically marginal!! Any average SEINFIELD episode is more realistic than this movie. And very few women actually want to look like Rosie O'Donnell (!). The script is so preachy: --The "bad girl" --a married woman having an affair with her ex-boyfriend --is made up to look harsh and unsympathetic and she's portrayed as a neglectful mother too, deserving punishment. --Maybe in REAL life she has her own frustrations. Maybe she even likes her children if not her husband. This film's simplistic "morality" reminds me of the Gangster and Cowboy films of the 1930s--the guys are all hell-raisers running close to the wrong side of the law, but then their girlfriend has a baby and they "learn responsibility" --and then her Dad takes the guy into the family business and they "raise a family.". Yeah--right. That world ended in the 1950s, if it ever really existed. So--what was your life like in 1996?--not like this movie I bet.

    Willy (Timothy Hutton), a piano player in Chicago, goes back to his small hometown for a class reunion. He meets up with his old friends. One is Tom (Matt Dillon) who has an anorexic girlfriend (Mira Sorvino) AND is being chased around by a married woman (Lauren Holly). Another is Paul (Michael Rapaport) who has been dumped by his girlfriend Jan (Martha Plimpton) because he won't marry her. Naturally he wants her back. Willy himself meets precocious 13 year old (Natalie Portman who was actually 17 when she did this) and starts falling for HER even though he has a wonderful girlfriend (Annabeth Gish)! Uma Thurman (looking great) pops up and Rose O'Donnell (not sure WHO she's playing) shows up to provide some much needed humor. This is not a deep meaningful movie. The problems (and characters) are familiar as are the outcomes. However this IS well-written and it has a cast of great actors who pull it all through. I was honestly never bored and it was a shock seeing Portman so young. Also there's one sequence that stops the movie when O'Donnell tells off Willy and Tom about sex, woman and relationships. O'Donnell is right on target here and hilarious. It was beautifully filmed (in Nova Scotia I believe) and has a great soundtrack. It's not perfect though. Rapaport's character got on my nerves quickly and there's a far too brutal beating at the end that just wasn't needed (and treats a main character far too cruelly). Still it is a very good movie with a wonderful cast. A perfect date movie. I give it a 7.

    Sorry but this movie made me want to kill myself . I LOVED Rosie O' Donnels performance and her speech in the drugstore made me hopeful that this movie was going to be about preaching that little thing called INNER beauty . NOT the case . No matter how many times a character was told this is the case , a better argument was made for the opposite . A pleasant surprise was seeing a young Natalie Portman , her timing ,amazing. We are ALL going to get older and we will ALL lose our beauty , even MODELS .We will ALL be replaced on the desire meter . And this movie was a sad reminder . NOT a feel-good movie . Be warned women .

    I absolutely LOVE this movie. And this is coming from someone who loves Scarface, Good Fellas, Apocalypse Now, Casino, James Bond, etc. Yea...it's that good. How many times have you seen a feel good movie only to realize that feel good must mean stupid, sappy, crappy waste of time? Beautiful Girls is a feel good movie that will actually make you feel good. There are so many awesome performances in this movie that it would not be fair to mention any specifically. However Timothy Hutton in the star role is wonderful and you can't help but fall in love with Natalie Portman. A group of friends get together and start taking stock of their lives. Romance, conflicts, drama, humor, this film has it all, as well as Uma Thurman. Great script, great acting, great fun. This movie will disappoint no one. Watch it with your boyfriend. He will enjoy it, even if he says he doesn't. Share it with your girlfriend, and she will love you forever. Simply wonderful.

    I had never heard of Beautiful Girls three years ago. After seeing portions of it then, I had always "caught" either the middle of the film, the very ending or somewhere between the opening credits and closing music. Though never seeing the movie in it's entirety until October 2010, (finally), I have always been fascinated by it, enthralled and completely sucked in to it, grasping at every spoken word, every poignant, touching scene; laughing, crying and basically loving every moment of this highly underrated movie. Even the little snowy "Ridge" town, somewhere in Minnepolis is just the perfect setting for the reunion of high school pals, Tommy, Willy, Kev, Mo and Paul. I am not exactly sure why, but this movie touches my very heart and soul, not so much that I can relate to the characters, the locale (I being a Southern California boy) or even the happy, drunken camaraderie of the friends of The Ridge, but there is a reality about it that just keeps you hanging on to every word and moment. Timothy Hutton is as usual, brilliant as Willy, the buddy who moved away from The Ridge to become a working piano player. His taboo, yet innocent relationship with Marty, a 13 year old girl who is an old soul, wise beyond her years is so touching,and his scenes with Andera in the bar and ice fishing shack, played wonderfully by Uma Thurmond are worthy of rewinding over and over and over again. I have yet to purchase this movie and but I guarantee when I do there will be a ton of rewinding and even more repeated viewing. So I urge you all, search for this movie at home, or better yet, buy it on DVD, sit down in front of the TV on a chilly fall or winter night (with a bottle of wine if you're of the age), in front of the warm glow of the fire and experience in my humble opinion, a great movie filled with characters you will love, some you may "know" and some you may not care for too much at all, but trust me, you will love this movie.

Rapaport's character got on my nerves quickly and there's a far too brutal beating at the end that just wasn't needed (and treats a main character far too cruelly). Still it is a very good movie with a wonderful cast. A perfect date movie. I give it a 7.

    Sorry but this movie made me want to kill myself . I LOVED Rosie O' Donnels performance and her speech in the drugstore made me hopeful that this movie was going to be about preaching that little thing called INNER beauty . NOT the case . No matter how many times a character was told this is the case , a better argument was made for the opposite . A pleasant surprise was seeing a young Natalie Portman , her timing ,amazing. We are ALL going to get older and we will ALL lose our beauty , even MODELS .We will ALL be replaced on the desire meter . And this movie was a sad reminder . NOT a feel-good movie .

    I absolutely LOVE this movie. And this is coming from someone who loves Scarface, Good Fellas, Apocalypse Now, Casino, James Bond, etc. Yea...it's that good. How many times have you seen a feel good movie only to realize that feel good must mean stupid, sappy, crappy waste of time? Beautiful Girls is a feel good movie that will actually make you feel good. There are so many awesome performances in this movie that it would not be fair to mention any specifically. However Timothy Hutton in the star role is wonderful and you can't help but fall in love with Natalie Portman. A group of friends get together and start taking stock of their lives. Romance, conflicts, drama, humor, this film has it all, as well as Uma Thurman. Great script, great acting, great fun. This movie will disappoint no one. Watch it with your boyfriend. He will enjoy it, even if he says he doesn't. Share it with your girlfriend, and she will love you forever. Simply wonderful.

    I had never heard of Beautiful Girls three years ago. After seeing portions of it then, I had always "caught" either the middle of the film, the very ending or somewhere between the opening credits and closing music. Though never seeing the movie in it's entirety until October 2010, (finally), I have always been fascinated by it, enthralled and completely sucked in to it, grasping at every spoken word, every poignant, touching scene; laughing, crying and basically loving every moment of this highly underrated movie. Even the little snowy "Ridge" town, somewhere in Minnepolis is just the perfect setting for the reunion of high school pals, Tommy, Willy, Kev, Mo and Paul. I am not exactly sure why, but this movie touches my very heart and soul, not so much that I can relate to the characters, the locale (I being a Southern California boy) or even the happy, drunken camaraderie of the friends of The Ridge, but there is a reality about it that just keeps you hanging on to every word and moment. Timothy Hutton is as usual, brilliant as Willy, the buddy who moved away from The Ridge to become a working piano player. His taboo, yet innocent relationship with Marty, a 13 year old girl who is an old soul, wise beyond her years is so touching,and his scenes with Andera in the bar and ice fishing shack, played wonderfully by Uma Thurmond are worthy of rewinding over and over and over again. I have yet to purchase this movie and but I guarantee when I do there will be a ton of rewinding and even more repeated viewing. So I urge you all, search for this movie at home, or better yet, buy it on DVD, sit down in front of the TV on a chilly fall or winter night (with a bottle of wine if you're of the age), in front of the warm glow of the fire and experience in my humble opinion, a great movie filled with characters you will love, some you may "know" and some you may not care for too much at all, but trust me, you will love this movie.

    Pianist Willie Conway (Timothy Hutton) is going back home for his high school reunion. He isn't making it and is at a crossroads. He finds himself falling for the 13 year old girl next door Marty (Natalie Portman). Many of his friends have stayed in town dealing with their own problems with love and unreasonable expectations. Paul Kirkwood (Michael Rapaport) is a child not satisfied with his girlfriend, still chasing for the next girl, and expounding on the virtues of the Beautiful Girls. There are a lot of memorable scenes. Rosie O'Donnell delivers a diatribe against the illusions of beautiful girls. But it's Natalie Portman who steals the show with a smart old soul. If there's anything, there're too many characters, too many story lines, too many relationships. It dilutes the product. A few less lead characters would be very helpful.

    Beautiful Girls is about Willie Conway,who goes home for his high school class reunion at New England. He is at a crossroads in his life and he can not decide if he should marry his girlfriend.Also,he can not decide if he should quit his music and take a job as a salesman. Over the course of the story, he spends time with his old friends who are all at similar crossroads. By the end they all discover what it is that they want.It stars Matt Dillon, Lauren Holly, Timothy Hutton, Rosie O'Donnell, Martha Plimpton, Natalie Portman, Michael Rapaport, Mira Sorvino, and Uma Thurman.It was directed by Ted Demme. This conversational film is about the gaping chasm between what men say and what they feel. It may not tell us anything new, but its eloquence is quietly rewarding.Nevertheless,it really succeeds with its warm treatment of ordinary hang-ups like no life-shattering revelations or pain repressed since childhood, just the genuine, everyday trials of life.Also,this coming of age tale is about guys in their 20's who refuse or are unable to mature as evidenced by the captivating relationship is between Timothy Hutton and the 13-year-old Natalie Portman,which steals all scenes and it is a delight.This is definitely a smart film about relationships and growing older that's funny and smart that many would surely enjoy.

    This is one of my favorite movies of all time. To expand the meaning of never judge a book by it's cover is such. The title kept me from watching it until a few years ago. When it was over, i hit play and watched it again. This movie is so genuine and heartfelt and real. It's loaded with a great cast and great quotes. "Beautiful girls" is a romantic comedy at heart but not just a chick flick. Guys will also enjoy it. So to anyone who has not seen it yet, i urge you to watch. It will make you laugh and cry but most of all should leave you feeling happy. This movie also has some of the greatest lines i have ever heard in a movie. One of my favorite characters is played by actor "Michael Rappaport." Some of his scenes i have lived by. The soundtrack to this movie is one of the best. So a perfect movie and perfect soundtrack, what more can you ask for?

    Beautiful Girls has a great story line and good characters. The plot is something anyone would be interested and relate to, and it is well acted. I really wish the dialogue were written by someone maybe a little more "earthy." There are some pretty cringe-worthy moments. In trying to capture a feeling of "bro" behavior, some of the dialog rings false, like it was either written by a woman who does not spend a lot of time with these types of men, or a man who does not have these kinds of friends. I know many men like the ones portrayed in the movie: trapped in their own self-defeating fantasies and not particularly successful. If one of them began a conversation like the ones in the film, his friends would think he was speaking in a different language. I know Uma Thurman was cast as the token "beautiful girl" yet some of the lines she said just sounded silly, maybe like contrived intelligent remarks. There are many highly intelligent and precociously funny teens like Natalie Portman, but they would have never said things like "daddy downer and brother bummer." That is the vernacular of a forty year old screenwriter. For a more realistic portrayal of the sharply sarcastic teen, watch Juno. I have taught for years and can see a vast difference in the two characters meant to appeal to older men. "Bros" like these would rather stick a needle in their eye rather than sit around a piano to sing "Sweet Caroline" to a girl they want to impress. Of all the dialogue and scenes, that seems the most artificial and contrived. I wish it were taken out of the film. I also have a few superficial quibbles...the actors do look much too old for a 10 year reunion. I am really ashamed of this particular complaint...but I sort of wish the characters had more 90's era style...to add some nostalgia. No one has any style. Also the soundtrack is horrific. However, it is very watchable overall.

    I was actually dreading to watch this movie since most similar genre movies end up to be melodramatic, preachy and finally sappy. My expectation started to turn out true with an irritating opening song through the credits and character introductions, but like the movie - I couldn't get the song out of my head now. Be it Michael Rapaport's unending bickering and whining, suave looks of Uma Thurman and then a masterstroke in a mature than her age teenager role of Natalie Portman. Adding her performance with 'Leon - The Professional', Natalie Portman is yesteryear's Chloe Mortez - but that is being generous for Chloe. Every serious, melodramatic moment has a fresh twist to make it entertaining, every character superbly defined and stay true to their character till the end. It was all in all an excellent ensemble performance from all involved appraising an equally well written script. Willie (Timothy Hutton) is at a crossroads with his career going nowhere as a musician and his relationship stuck due to his commitment phobia. He decides to comeback to his hometown to attend his high school reunion while catching up on his old friends Tommy (Matt Dillon), Mo (Noah Emmerich) and Paul (Michael Rapaport) each going through different phases in their life and relationships. When Willie thinks nothing could go any worse, he falls for a 13 year old Marty (Natalie Portman). There is a wicked sense of humor here commonly not associated with movies of that era. While the director treasures and elevates some key moments, also tries to keep it a little lighter and borderline quirky. What this movie required was not great performances but spontaneous ones and gets plenty of them from the able cast, especially little Natalie Portman. The background score could have been better except for the irritatingly catchy opening song which is used extensively throughout the movie. There is a little lull somewhere before the last quarter part of the movie, but picks up quite well leading to a predictable yet well executed finish.

    It was fun seeing the "new young acting talent" of 1996 in a way. (Remember the movie "Singles"?) Timothy Hutton and Natalie Portman have the best roles, but these too are one-dimensional and formulaic. If you want to see a much more realistic treatment of these themes please see the obscure independent film "Mulletville." You won't be disappointed. But the script here--ye gods! It has Rosie O'Donnell telling the male characters that "real women" should look like her (!) and that men should quit admiring "supermodels." Would you like a date with Rosie O'? The basic plot of the movie is that young rowdy small-town men need to "give up' their "irresponsible" hell-raising and "settle down" with "realistic" women who don't look very pretty or glamorous.(Including Timothy Hutton's lawyer-girlfriend-- a lawyer girlfriend so "responsible"!) Well--in the economy of the past 10 years--2002-2012 --people do not get to "settle down." --Their lives are too economically marginal!! Any average SEINFIELD episode is more realistic than this movie. And very few women actually want to look like Rosie O'Donnell (!). The script is so preachy: --The "bad girl" --a married woman having an affair with her ex-boyfriend --is made up to look harsh and unsympathetic and she's portrayed as a neglectful mother too, deserving punishment. --Maybe in REAL life she has her own frustrations. Maybe she even likes her children if not her husband. This film's simplistic "morality" reminds me of the Gangster and Cowboy films of the 1930s--the guys are all hell-raisers running close to the wrong side of the law, but then their girlfriend has a baby and they "learn responsibility" --and then her Dad takes the guy into the family business and they "raise a family.". Yeah--right. That world ended in the 1950s, if it ever really existed. So--what was your life like in 1996?--not like this movie I bet.

    Willy (Timothy Hutton), a piano player in Chicago, goes back to his small hometown for a class reunion. He meets up with his old friends. One is Tom (Matt Dillon) who has an anorexic girlfriend (Mira Sorvino) AND is being chased around by a married woman (Lauren Holly). Another is Paul (Michael Rapaport) who has been dumped by his girlfriend Jan (Martha Plimpton) because he won't marry her. Naturally he wants her back. Willy himself meets precocious 13 year old (Natalie Portman who was actually 17 when she did this) and starts falling for HER even though he has a wonderful girlfriend (Annabeth Gish)! Uma Thurman (looking great) pops up and Rose O'Donnell (not sure WHO she's playing) shows up to provide some much needed humor. This is not a deep meaningful movie. The problems (and characters) are familiar as are the outcomes. However this IS well-written and it has a cast of great actors who pull it all through. I was honestly never bored and it was a shock seeing Portman so young. Also there's one sequence that stops the movie when O'Donnell tells off Willy and Tom about sex, woman and relationships. O'Donnell is right on target here and hilarious. It was beautifully filmed (in Nova Scotia I believe) and has a great soundtrack. It's not perfect though. Rapaport's character got on my nerves quickly and there's a far too brutal beating at the end that just wasn't needed (and treats a main character far too cruelly). Still it is a very good movie with a wonderful cast. A perfect date movie. I give it a 7.

The script is so preachy: --The "bad girl" --a married woman having an affair with her ex-boyfriend --is made up to look harsh and unsympathetic and she's portrayed as a neglectful mother too, deserving punishment. --Maybe in REAL life she has her own frustrations. Maybe she even likes her children if not her husband. This film's simplistic "morality" reminds me of the Gangster and Cowboy films of the 1930s--the guys are all hell-raisers running close to the wrong side of the law, but then their girlfriend has a baby and they "learn responsibility" --and then her Dad takes the guy into the family business and they "raise a family.". Yeah--right. That world ended in the 1950s, if it ever really existed. So--what was your life like in 1996?--not like this movie I bet.

    Willy (Timothy Hutton), a piano player in Chicago, goes back to his small hometown for a class reunion. He meets up with his old friends. One is Tom (Matt Dillon) who has an anorexic girlfriend (Mira Sorvino) AND is being chased around by a married woman (Lauren Holly). Another is Paul (Michael Rapaport) who has been dumped by his girlfriend Jan (Martha Plimpton) because he won't marry her. Naturally he wants her back. Willy himself meets precocious 13 year old (Natalie Portman who was actually 17 when she did this) and starts falling for HER even though he has a wonderful girlfriend (Annabeth Gish)! Uma Thurman (looking great) pops up and Rose O'Donnell (not sure WHO she's playing) shows up to provide some much needed humor. This is not a deep meaningful movie. The problems (and characters) are familiar as are the outcomes. However this IS well-written and it has a cast of great actors who pull it all through. I was honestly never bored and it was a shock seeing Portman so young. Also there's one sequence that stops the movie when O'Donnell tells off Willy and Tom about sex, woman and relationships. O'Donnell is right on target here and hilarious. It was beautifully filmed (in Nova Scotia I believe) and has a great soundtrack. It's not perfect though. Rapaport's character got on my nerves quickly and there's a far too brutal beating at the end that just wasn't needed (and treats a main character far too cruelly). Still it is a very good movie with a wonderful cast. A perfect date movie. I give it a 7.

    Sorry but this movie made me want to kill myself . I LOVED Rosie O' Donnels performance and her speech in the drugstore made me hopeful that this movie was going to be about preaching that little thing called INNER beauty . NOT the case . No matter how many times a character was told this is the case , a better argument was made for the opposite . A pleasant surprise was seeing a young Natalie Portman , her timing ,amazing. We are ALL going to get older and we will ALL lose our beauty , even MODELS .We will ALL be replaced on the desire meter . And this movie was a sad reminder . NOT a feel-good movie .

    I absolutely LOVE this movie. And this is coming from someone who loves Scarface, Good Fellas, Apocalypse Now, Casino, James Bond, etc. Yea...it's that good. How many times have you seen a feel good movie only to realize that feel good must mean stupid, sappy, crappy waste of time? Beautiful Girls is a feel good movie that will actually make you feel good. There are so many awesome performances in this movie that it would not be fair to mention any specifically. However Timothy Hutton in the star role is wonderful and you can't help but fall in love with Natalie Portman. A group of friends get together and start taking stock of their lives. Romance, conflicts, drama, humor, this film has it all, as well as Uma Thurman. Great script, great acting, great fun. This movie will disappoint no one. Watch it with your boyfriend. He will enjoy it, even if he says he doesn't. Share it with your girlfriend, and she will love you forever. Simply wonderful.

    I had never heard of Beautiful Girls three years ago. After seeing portions of it then, I had always "caught" either the middle of the film, the very ending or somewhere between the opening credits and closing music. Though never seeing the movie in it's entirety until October 2010, (finally), I have always been fascinated by it, enthralled and completely sucked in to it, grasping at every spoken word, every poignant, touching scene; laughing, crying and basically loving every moment of this highly underrated movie. Even the little snowy "Ridge" town, somewhere in Minnepolis is just the perfect setting for the reunion of high school pals, Tommy, Willy, Kev, Mo and Paul. I am not exactly sure why, but this movie touches my very heart and soul, not so much that I can relate to the characters, the locale (I being a Southern California boy) or even the happy, drunken camaraderie of the friends of The Ridge, but there is a reality about it that just keeps you hanging on to every word and moment. Timothy Hutton is as usual, brilliant as Willy, the buddy who moved away from The Ridge to become a working piano player. His taboo, yet innocent relationship with Marty, a 13 year old girl who is an old soul, wise beyond her years is so touching,and his scenes with Andera in the bar and ice fishing shack, played wonderfully by Uma Thurmond are worthy of rewinding over and over and over again. I have yet to purchase this movie and but I guarantee when I do there will be a ton of rewinding and even more repeated viewing. So I urge you all, search for this movie at home, or better yet, buy it on DVD, sit down in front of the TV on a chilly fall or winter night (with a bottle of wine if you're of the age), in front of the warm glow of the fire and experience in my humble opinion, a great movie filled with characters you will love, some you may "know" and some you may not care for too much at all, but trust me, you will love this movie.

    Pianist Willie Conway (Timothy Hutton) is going back home for his high school reunion. He isn't making it and is at a crossroads. He finds himself falling for the 13 year old girl next door Marty (Natalie Portman). Many of his friends have stayed in town dealing with their own problems with love and unreasonable expectations. Paul Kirkwood (Michael Rapaport) is a child not satisfied with his girlfriend, still chasing for the next girl, and expounding on the virtues of the Beautiful Girls. There are a lot of memorable scenes. Rosie O'Donnell delivers a diatribe against the illusions of beautiful girls. But it's Natalie Portman who steals the show with a smart old soul. If there's anything, there're too many characters, too many story lines, too many relationships. It dilutes the product. A few less lead characters would be very helpful.

    Beautiful Girls is about Willie Conway,who goes home for his high school class reunion at New England. He is at a crossroads in his life and he can not decide if he should marry his girlfriend.Also,he can not decide if he should quit his music and take a job as a salesman. Over the course of the story, he spends time with his old friends who are all at similar crossroads. By the end they all discover what it is that they want.It stars Matt Dillon, Lauren Holly, Timothy Hutton, Rosie O'Donnell, Martha Plimpton, Natalie Portman, Michael Rapaport, Mira Sorvino, and Uma Thurman.It was directed by Ted Demme. This conversational film is about the gaping chasm between what men say and what they feel. It may not tell us anything new, but its eloquence is quietly rewarding.Nevertheless,it really succeeds with its warm treatment of ordinary hang-ups like no life-shattering revelations or pain repressed since childhood, just the genuine, everyday trials of life.Also,this coming of age tale is about guys in their 20's who refuse or are unable to mature as evidenced by the captivating relationship is between Timothy Hutton and the 13-year-old Natalie Portman,which steals all scenes and it is a delight.This is definitely a smart film about relationships and growing older that's funny and smart that many would surely enjoy.

    This is one of my favorite movies of all time. To expand the meaning of never judge a book by it's cover is such. The title kept me from watching it until a few years ago. When it was over, i hit play and watched it again. This movie is so genuine and heartfelt and real. It's loaded with a great cast and great quotes. "Beautiful girls" is a romantic comedy at heart but not just a chick flick. Guys will also enjoy it. So to anyone who has not seen it yet, i urge you to watch. It will make you laugh and cry but most of all should leave you feeling happy. This movie also has some of the greatest lines i have ever heard in a movie. One of my favorite characters is played by actor "Michael Rappaport." Some of his scenes i have lived by. The soundtrack to this movie is one of the best. So a perfect movie and perfect soundtrack, what more can you ask for?

    Beautiful Girls has a great story line and good characters. The plot is something anyone would be interested and relate to, and it is well acted. I really wish the dialogue were written by someone maybe a little more "earthy." There are some pretty cringe-worthy moments. In trying to capture a feeling of "bro" behavior, some of the dialog rings false, like it was either written by a woman who does not spend a lot of time with these types of men, or a man who does not have these kinds of friends. I know many men like the ones portrayed in the movie: trapped in their own self-defeating fantasies and not particularly successful. If one of them began a conversation like the ones in the film, his friends would think he was speaking in a different language. I know Uma Thurman was cast as the token "beautiful girl" yet some of the lines she said just sounded silly, maybe like contrived intelligent remarks. There are many highly intelligent and precociously funny teens like Natalie Portman, but they would have never said things like "daddy downer and brother bummer." That is the vernacular of a forty year old screenwriter. For a more realistic portrayal of the sharply sarcastic teen, watch Juno. I have taught for years and can see a vast difference in the two characters meant to appeal to older men. "Bros" like these would rather stick a needle in their eye rather than sit around a piano to sing "Sweet Caroline" to a girl they want to impress. Of all the dialogue and scenes, that seems the most artificial and contrived. I wish it were taken out of the film. I also have a few superficial quibbles...the actors do look much too old for a 10 year reunion. I am really ashamed of this particular complaint...but I sort of wish the characters had more 90's era style...to add some nostalgia. No one has any style. Also the soundtrack is horrific. However, it is very watchable overall.

    I was actually dreading to watch this movie since most similar genre movies end up to be melodramatic, preachy and finally sappy. My expectation started to turn out true with an irritating opening song through the credits and character introductions, but like the movie - I couldn't get the song out of my head now. Be it Michael Rapaport's unending bickering and whining, suave looks of Uma Thurman and then a masterstroke in a mature than her age teenager role of Natalie Portman. Adding her performance with 'Leon - The Professional', Natalie Portman is yesteryear's Chloe Mortez - but that is being generous for Chloe. Every serious, melodramatic moment has a fresh twist to make it entertaining, every character superbly defined and stay true to their character till the end. It was all in all an excellent ensemble performance from all involved appraising an equally well written script. Willie (Timothy Hutton) is at a crossroads with his career going nowhere as a musician and his relationship stuck due to his commitment phobia. He decides to comeback to his hometown to attend his high school reunion while catching up on his old friends Tommy (Matt Dillon), Mo (Noah Emmerich) and Paul (Michael Rapaport) each going through different phases in their life and relationships. When Willie thinks nothing could go any worse, he falls for a 13 year old Marty (Natalie Portman). There is a wicked sense of humor here commonly not associated with movies of that era. While the director treasures and elevates some key moments, also tries to keep it a little lighter and borderline quirky. What this movie required was not great performances but spontaneous ones and gets plenty of them from the able cast, especially little Natalie Portman. The background score could have been better except for the irritatingly catchy opening song which is used extensively throughout the movie. There is a little lull somewhere before the last quarter part of the movie, but picks up quite well leading to a predictable yet well executed finish. A rare male perspective romantic comedy with a superb spontaneous ensemble performance

    It was fun seeing the "new young acting talent" of 1996 in a way. (Remember the movie "Singles"?) Timothy Hutton and Natalie Portman have the best roles, but these too are one-dimensional and formulaic. If you want to see a much more realistic treatment of these themes please see the obscure independent film "Mulletville." You won't be disappointed. But the script here--ye gods! It has Rosie O'Donnell telling the male characters that "real women" should look like her (!) and that men should quit admiring "supermodels." Would you like a date with Rosie O'? The basic plot of the movie is that young rowdy small-town men need to "give up' their "irresponsible" hell-raising and "settle down" with "realistic" women who don't look very pretty or glamorous.(Including Timothy Hutton's lawyer-girlfriend-- a lawyer girlfriend so "responsible"!) Well--in the economy of the past 10 years--2002-2012 --people do not get to "settle down." --Their lives are too economically marginal!! Any average SEINFIELD episode is more realistic than this movie. And very few women actually want to look like Rosie O'Donnell (!). The script is so preachy: --The "bad girl" --a married woman having an affair with her ex-boyfriend --is made up to look harsh and unsympathetic and she's portrayed as a neglectful mother too, deserving punishment. --Maybe in REAL life she has her own frustrations. Maybe she even likes her children if not her husband. This film's simplistic "morality" reminds me of the Gangster and Cowboy films of the 1930s--the guys are all hell-raisers running close to the wrong side of the law, but then their girlfriend has a baby and they "learn responsibility" --and then her Dad takes the guy into the family business and they "raise a family.". Yeah--right. That world ended in the 1950s, if it ever really existed. So--what was your life like in 1996?--not like this movie I bet.

O'Donnell is right on target here and hilarious. It was beautifully filmed (in Nova Scotia I believe) and has a great soundtrack. It's not perfect though. Rapaport's character got on my nerves quickly and there's a far too brutal beating at the end that just wasn't needed (and treats a main character far too cruelly). Still it is a very good movie with a wonderful cast. A perfect date movie. I give it a 7.

He decides to comeback to his hometown to attend his high school reunion while catching up on his old friends Tommy (Matt Dillon), Mo (Noah Emmerich) and Paul (Michael Rapaport) each going through different phases in their life and relationships. When Willie thinks nothing could go any worse, he falls for a 13 year old Marty (Natalie Portman). There is a wicked sense of humor here commonly not associated with movies of that era. While the director treasures and elevates some key moments, also tries to keep it a little lighter and borderline quirky. What this movie required was not great performances but spontaneous ones and gets plenty of them from the able cast, especially little Natalie Portman. The background score could have been better except for the irritatingly catchy opening song which is used extensively throughout the movie. There is a little lull somewhere before the last quarter part of the movie, but picks up quite well leading to a predictable yet well executed finish.

    It was fun seeing the "new young acting talent" of 1996 in a way. (Remember the movie "Singles"?) Timothy Hutton and Natalie Portman have the best roles, but these too are one-dimensional and formulaic. If you want to see a much more realistic treatment of these themes please see the obscure independent film "Mulletville." You won't be disappointed. But the script here--ye gods! It has Rosie O'Donnell telling the male characters that "real women" should look like her (!) and that men should quit admiring "supermodels." Would you like a date with Rosie O'? The basic plot of the movie is that young rowdy small-town men need to "give up' their "irresponsible" hell-raising and "settle down" with "realistic" women who don't look very pretty or glamorous.(Including Timothy Hutton's lawyer-girlfriend-- a lawyer girlfriend so "responsible"!) Well--in the economy of the past 10 years--2002-2012 --people do not get to "settle down." --Their lives are too economically marginal!! Any average SEINFIELD episode is more realistic than this movie. And very few women actually want to look like Rosie O'Donnell (!). The script is so preachy: --The "bad girl" --a married woman having an affair with her ex-boyfriend --is made up to look harsh and unsympathetic and she's portrayed as a neglectful mother too, deserving punishment. --Maybe in REAL life she has her own frustrations. Maybe she even likes her children if not her husband. This film's simplistic "morality" reminds me of the Gangster and Cowboy films of the 1930s--the guys are all hell-raisers running close to the wrong side of the law, but then their girlfriend has a baby and they "learn responsibility" --and then her Dad takes the guy into the family business and they "raise a family.". Yeah--right. That world ended in the 1950s, if it ever really existed. So--what was your life like in 1996?--not like this movie I bet.

    Willy (Timothy Hutton), a piano player in Chicago, goes back to his small hometown for a class reunion. He meets up with his old friends. One is Tom (Matt Dillon) who has an anorexic girlfriend (Mira Sorvino) AND is being chased around by a married woman (Lauren Holly). Another is Paul (Michael Rapaport) who has been dumped by his girlfriend Jan (Martha Plimpton) because he won't marry her. Naturally he wants her back. Willy himself meets precocious 13 year old (Natalie Portman who was actually 17 when she did this) and starts falling for HER even though he has a wonderful girlfriend (Annabeth Gish)! Uma Thurman (looking great) pops up and Rose O'Donnell (not sure WHO she's playing) shows up to provide some much needed humor. This is not a deep meaningful movie. The problems (and characters) are familiar as are the outcomes. However this IS well-written and it has a cast of great actors who pull it all through. I was honestly never bored and it was a shock seeing Portman so young. Also there's one sequence that stops the movie when O'Donnell tells off Willy and Tom about sex, woman and relationships. O'Donnell is right on target here and hilarious. It was beautifully filmed (in Nova Scotia I believe) and has a great soundtrack. It's not perfect though. Rapaport's character got on my nerves quickly and there's a far too brutal beating at the end that just wasn't needed (and treats a main character far too cruelly). Still it is a very good movie with a wonderful cast. A perfect date movie. I give it a 7.

No matter how many times a character was told this is the case , a better argument was made for the opposite . A pleasant surprise was seeing a young Natalie Portman , her timing ,amazing.

    I absolutely LOVE this movie. And this is coming from someone who loves Scarface, Good Fellas, Apocalypse Now, Casino, James Bond, etc. Yea...it's that good. How many times have you seen a feel good movie only to realize that feel good must mean stupid, sappy, crappy waste of time? Beautiful Girls is a feel good movie that will actually make you feel good. There are so many awesome performances in this movie that it would not be fair to mention any specifically. However Timothy Hutton in the star role is wonderful and you can't help but fall in love with Natalie Portman. A group of friends get together and start taking stock of their lives. Romance, conflicts, drama, humor, this film has it all, as well as Uma Thurman. Great script, great acting, great fun. This movie will disappoint no one. Watch it with your boyfriend. He will enjoy it, even if he says he doesn't. Share it with your girlfriend, and she will love you forever. Simply wonderful.

    I had never heard of Beautiful Girls three years ago. After seeing portions of it then, I had always "caught" either the middle of the film, the very ending or somewhere between the opening credits and closing music. Though never seeing the movie in it's entirety until October 2010, (finally), I have always been fascinated by it, enthralled and completely sucked in to it, grasping at every spoken word, every poignant, touching scene; laughing, crying and basically loving every moment of this highly underrated movie. Even the little snowy "Ridge" town, somewhere in Minnepolis is just the perfect setting for the reunion of high school pals, Tommy, Willy, Kev, Mo and Paul. I am not exactly sure why, but this movie touches my very heart and soul, not so much that I can relate to the characters, the locale (I being a Southern California boy) or even the happy, drunken camaraderie of the friends of The Ridge, but there is a reality about it that just keeps you hanging on to every word and moment. Timothy Hutton is as usual, brilliant as Willy, the buddy who moved away from The Ridge to become a working piano player. His taboo, yet innocent relationship with Marty, a 13 year old girl who is an old soul, wise beyond her years is so touching,and his scenes with Andera in the bar and ice fishing shack, played wonderfully by Uma Thurmond are worthy of rewinding over and over and over again. I have yet to purchase this movie and but I guarantee when I do there will be a ton of rewinding and even more repeated viewing. So I urge you all, search for this movie at home, or better yet, buy it on DVD, sit down in front of the TV on a chilly fall or winter night (with a bottle of wine if you're of the age), in front of the warm glow of the fire and experience in my humble opinion, a great movie filled with characters you will love, some you may "know" and some you may not care for too much at all, but trust me, you will love this movie.

It may not tell us anything new, but its eloquence is quietly rewarding.Nevertheless,it really succeeds with its warm treatment of ordinary hang-ups like no life-shattering revelations or pain repressed since childhood, just the genuine, everyday trials of life.Also,this coming of age tale is about guys in their 20's who refuse or are unable to mature as evidenced by the captivating relationship is between Timothy Hutton and the 13-year-old Natalie Portman,which steals all scenes and it is a delight.This is definitely a smart film about relationships and growing older that's funny and smart that many would surely enjoy.

    This is one of my favorite movies of all time. To expand the meaning of never judge a book by it's cover is such. The title kept me from watching it until a few years ago. When it was over, i hit play and watched it again. This movie is so genuine and heartfelt and real. It's loaded with a great cast and great quotes. "Beautiful girls" is a romantic comedy at heart but not just a chick flick. Guys will also enjoy it. So to anyone who has not seen it yet, i urge you to watch. It will make you laugh and cry but most of all should leave you feeling happy. This movie also has some of the greatest lines i have ever heard in a movie. One of my favorite characters is played by actor "Michael Rappaport." Some of his scenes i have lived by. The soundtrack to this movie is one of the best. So a perfect movie and perfect soundtrack, what more can you ask for?

    Beautiful Girls has a great story line and good characters. The plot is something anyone would be interested and relate to, and it is well acted. I really wish the dialogue were written by someone maybe a little more "earthy." There are some pretty cringe-worthy moments. In trying to capture a feeling of "bro" behavior, some of the dialog rings false, like it was either written by a woman who does not spend a lot of time with these types of men, or a man who does not have these kinds of friends. I know many men like the ones portrayed in the movie: trapped in their own self-defeating fantasies and not particularly successful. If one of them began a conversation like the ones in the film, his friends would think he was speaking in a different language. I know Uma Thurman was cast as the token "beautiful girl" yet some of the lines she said just sounded silly, maybe like contrived intelligent remarks. There are many highly intelligent and precociously funny teens like Natalie Portman, but they would have never said things like "daddy downer and brother bummer." That is the vernacular of a forty year old screenwriter. For a more realistic portrayal of the sharply sarcastic teen, watch Juno. I have taught for years and can see a vast difference in the two characters meant to appeal to older men. "Bros" like these would rather stick a needle in their eye rather than sit around a piano to sing "Sweet Caroline" to a girl they want to impress. Of all the dialogue and scenes, that seems the most artificial and contrived. I wish it were taken out of the film. I also have a few superficial quibbles...the actors do look much too old for a 10 year reunion. I am really ashamed of this particular complaint...but I sort of wish the characters had more 90's era style...to add some nostalgia. No one has any style. Also the soundtrack is horrific. However, it is very watchable overall.

    I was actually dreading to watch this movie since most similar genre movies end up to be melodramatic, preachy and finally sappy. My expectation started to turn out true with an irritating opening song through the credits and character introductions, but like the movie - I couldn't get the song out of my head now. Be it Michael Rapaport's unending bickering and whining, suave looks of Uma Thurman and then a masterstroke in a mature than her age teenager role of Natalie Portman. Adding her performance with 'Leon - The Professional', Natalie Portman is yesteryear's Chloe Mortez - but that is being generous for Chloe. Every serious, melodramatic moment has a fresh twist to make it entertaining, every character superbly defined and stay true to their character till the end. It was all in all an excellent ensemble performance from all involved appraising an equally well written script. Willie (Timothy Hutton) is at a crossroads with his career going nowhere as a musician and his relationship stuck due to his commitment phobia. He decides to comeback to his hometown to attend his high school reunion while catching up on his old friends Tommy (Matt Dillon), Mo (Noah Emmerich) and Paul (Michael Rapaport) each going through different phases in their life and relationships. When Willie thinks nothing could go any worse, he falls for a 13 year old Marty (Natalie Portman). There is a wicked sense of humor here commonly not associated with movies of that era. While the director treasures and elevates some key moments, also tries to keep it a little lighter and borderline quirky. What this movie required was not great performances but spontaneous ones and gets plenty of them from the able cast, especially little Natalie Portman. The background score could have been better except for the irritatingly catchy opening song which is used extensively throughout the movie. There is a little lull somewhere before the last quarter part of the movie, but picks up quite well leading to a predictable yet well executed finish.

    It was fun seeing the "new young acting talent" of 1996 in a way. (Remember the movie "Singles"?) Timothy Hutton and Natalie Portman have the best roles, but these too are one-dimensional and formulaic. If you want to see a much more realistic treatment of these themes please see the obscure independent film "Mulletville." You won't be disappointed. But the script here--ye gods! It has Rosie O'Donnell telling the male characters that "real women" should look like her (!) and that men should quit admiring "supermodels." Would you like a date with Rosie O'? The basic plot of the movie is that young rowdy small-town men need to "give up' their "irresponsible" hell-raising and "settle down" with "realistic" women who don't look very pretty or glamorous.(Including Timothy Hutton's lawyer-girlfriend-- a lawyer girlfriend so "responsible"!) Well--in the economy of the past 10 years--2002-2012 --people do not get to "settle down." --Their lives are too economically marginal!! Any average SEINFIELD episode is more realistic than this movie. And very few women actually want to look like Rosie O'Donnell (!). The script is so preachy: --The "bad girl" --a married woman having an affair with her ex-boyfriend --is made up to look harsh and unsympathetic and she's portrayed as a neglectful mother too, deserving punishment. --Maybe in REAL life she has her own frustrations. Maybe she even likes her children if not her husband. This film's simplistic "morality" reminds me of the Gangster and Cowboy films of the 1930s--the guys are all hell-raisers running close to the wrong side of the law, but then their girlfriend has a baby and they "learn responsibility" --and then her Dad takes the guy into the family business and they "raise a family.". Yeah--right. That world ended in the 1950s, if it ever really existed. So--what was your life like in 1996?--not like this movie I bet.

I know Uma Thurman was cast as the token "beautiful girl" yet some of the lines she said just sounded silly, maybe like contrived intelligent remarks. There are many highly intelligent and precociously funny teens like Natalie Portman, but they would have never said things like "daddy downer and brother bummer." That is the vernacular of a forty year old screenwriter. For a more realistic portrayal of the sharply sarcastic teen, watch Juno. I have taught for years and can see a vast difference in the two characters meant to appeal to older men. "Bros" like these would rather stick a needle in their eye rather than sit around a piano to sing "Sweet Caroline" to a girl they want to impress. Of all the dialogue and scenes, that seems the most artificial and contrived. I wish it were taken out of the film. I also have a few superficial quibbles...the actors do look much too old for a 10 year reunion. I am really ashamed of this particular complaint...but I sort of wish the characters had more 90's era style...to add some nostalgia. No one has any style. Also the soundtrack is horrific. However, it is very watchable overall.

    I was actually dreading to watch this movie since most similar genre movies end up to be melodramatic, preachy and finally sappy. My expectation started to turn out true with an irritating opening song through the credits and character introductions, but like the movie - I couldn't get the song out of my head now. Be it Michael Rapaport's unending bickering and whining, suave looks of Uma Thurman and then a masterstroke in a mature than her age teenager role of Natalie Portman. Adding her performance with 'Leon - The Professional', Natalie Portman is yesteryear's Chloe Mortez - but that is being generous for Chloe. Every serious, melodramatic moment has a fresh twist to make it entertaining, every character superbly defined and stay true to their character till the end. It was all in all an excellent ensemble performance from all involved appraising an equally well written script. Willie (Timothy Hutton) is at a crossroads with his career going nowhere as a musician and his relationship stuck due to his commitment phobia. He decides to comeback to his hometown to attend his high school reunion while catching up on his old friends Tommy (Matt Dillon), Mo (Noah Emmerich) and Paul (Michael Rapaport) each going through different phases in their life and relationships. When Willie thinks nothing could go any worse, he falls for a 13 year old Marty (Natalie Portman). There is a wicked sense of humor here commonly not associated with movies of that era. While the director treasures and elevates some key moments, also tries to keep it a little lighter and borderline quirky. What this movie required was not great performances but spontaneous ones and gets plenty of them from the able cast, especially little Natalie Portman. The background score could have been better except for the irritatingly catchy opening song which is used extensively throughout the movie. There is a little lull somewhere before the last quarter part of the movie, but picks up quite well leading to a predictable yet well executed finish.

    It was fun seeing the "new young acting talent" of 1996 in a way. (Remember the movie "Singles"?) Timothy Hutton and Natalie Portman have the best roles, but these too are one-dimensional and formulaic. If you want to see a much more realistic treatment of these themes please see the obscure independent film "Mulletville." You won't be disappointed. But the script here--ye gods! It has Rosie O'Donnell telling the male characters that "real women" should look like her (!) and that men should quit admiring "supermodels." Would you like a date with Rosie O'? The basic plot of the movie is that young rowdy small-town men need to "give up' their "irresponsible" hell-raising and "settle down" with "realistic" women who don't look very pretty or glamorous.(Including Timothy Hutton's lawyer-girlfriend-- a lawyer girlfriend so "responsible"!) Well--in the economy of the past 10 years--2002-2012 --people do not get to "settle down." --Their lives are too economically marginal!! Any average SEINFIELD episode is more realistic than this movie. And very few women actually want to look like Rosie O'Donnell (!). The script is so preachy: --The "bad girl" --a married woman having an affair with her ex-boyfriend --is made up to look harsh and unsympathetic and she's portrayed as a neglectful mother too, deserving punishment. --Maybe in REAL life she has her own frustrations. Maybe she even likes her children if not her husband. This film's simplistic "morality" reminds me of the Gangster and Cowboy films of the 1930s--the guys are all hell-raisers running close to the wrong side of the law, but then their girlfriend has a baby and they "learn responsibility" --and then her Dad takes the guy into the family business and they "raise a family.". Yeah--right. That world ended in the 1950s, if it ever really existed. So--what was your life like in 1996?--not like this movie I bet.

    Willy (Timothy Hutton), a piano player in Chicago, goes back to his small hometown for a class reunion. He meets up with his old friends. One is Tom (Matt Dillon) who has an anorexic girlfriend (Mira Sorvino) AND is being chased around by a married woman (Lauren Holly). Another is Paul (Michael Rapaport) who has been dumped by his girlfriend Jan (Martha Plimpton) because he won't marry her. Naturally he wants her back. Willy himself meets precocious 13 year old (Natalie Portman who was actually 17 when she did this) and starts falling for HER even though he has a wonderful girlfriend (Annabeth Gish)! Uma Thurman (looking great) pops up and Rose O'Donnell (not sure WHO she's playing) shows up to provide some much needed humor. This is not a deep meaningful movie. The problems (and characters) are familiar as are the outcomes. However this IS well-written and it has a cast of great actors who pull it all through. I was honestly never bored and it was a shock seeing Portman so young. Also there's one sequence that stops the movie when O'Donnell tells off Willy and Tom about sex, woman and relationships. O'Donnell is right on target here and hilarious. It was beautifully filmed (in Nova Scotia I believe) and has a great soundtrack. It's not perfect though. Rapaport's character got on my nerves quickly and there's a far too brutal beating at the end that just wasn't needed (and treats a main character far too cruelly). Still it is a very good movie with a wonderful cast. A perfect date movie. I give it a 7.

    I absolutely LOVE this movie. And this is coming from someone who loves Scarface, Good Fellas, Apocalypse Now, Casino, James Bond, etc. Yea...it's that good. How many times have you seen a feel good movie only to realize that feel good must mean stupid, sappy, crappy waste of time? Beautiful Girls is a feel good movie that will actually make you feel good. There are so many awesome performances in this movie that it would not be fair to mention any specifically. However Timothy Hutton in the star role is wonderful and you can't help but fall in love with Natalie Portman. A group of friends get together and start taking stock of their lives. Romance, conflicts, drama, humor, this film has it all, as well as Uma Thurman. Great script, great acting, great fun. This movie will disappoint no one. Watch it with your boyfriend. He will enjoy it, even if he says he doesn't. Share it with your girlfriend, and she will love you forever. Simply wonderful.

    I had never heard of Beautiful Girls three years ago. After seeing portions of it then, I had always "caught" either the middle of the film, the very ending or somewhere between the opening credits and closing music. Though never seeing the movie in it's entirety until October 2010, (finally), I have always been fascinated by it, enthralled and completely sucked in to it, grasping at every spoken word, every poignant, touching scene; laughing, crying and basically loving every moment of this highly underrated movie. Even the little snowy "Ridge" town, somewhere in Minnepolis is just the perfect setting for the reunion of high school pals, Tommy, Willy, Kev, Mo and Paul. I am not exactly sure why, but this movie touches my very heart and soul, not so much that I can relate to the characters, the locale (I being a Southern California boy) or even the happy, drunken camaraderie of the friends of The Ridge, but there is a reality about it that just keeps you hanging on to every word and moment. Timothy Hutton is as usual, brilliant as Willy, the buddy who moved away from The Ridge to become a working piano player. His taboo, yet innocent relationship with Marty, a 13 year old girl who is an old soul, wise beyond her years is so touching,and his scenes with Andera in the bar and ice fishing shack, played wonderfully by Uma Thurmond are worthy of rewinding over and over and over again. I have yet to purchase this movie and but I guarantee when I do there will be a ton of rewinding and even more repeated viewing. So I urge you all, search for this movie at home, or better yet, buy it on DVD, sit down in front of the TV on a chilly fall or winter night (with a bottle of wine if you're of the age), in front of the warm glow of the fire and experience in my humble opinion, a great movie filled with characters you will love, some you may "know" and some you may not care for too much at all, but trust me, you will love this movie.

He finds himself falling for the 13 year old girl next door Marty (Natalie Portman). Many of his friends have stayed in town dealing with their own problems with love and unreasonable expectations. Paul Kirkwood (Michael Rapaport) is a child not satisfied with his girlfriend, still chasing for the next girl, and expounding on the virtues of the Beautiful Girls. There are a lot of memorable scenes. Rosie O'Donnell delivers a diatribe against the illusions of beautiful girls. But it's Natalie Portman who steals the show with a smart old soul. If there's anything, there're too many characters, too many story lines, too many relationships. It dilutes the product. A few less lead characters would be very helpful.

By the end they all discover what it is that they want.It stars Matt Dillon, Lauren Holly, Timothy Hutton, Rosie O'Donnell, Martha Plimpton, Natalie Portman, Michael Rapaport, Mira Sorvino, and Uma Thurman.It was directed by Ted Demme. This conversational film is about the gaping chasm between what men say and what they feel. It may not tell us anything new, but its eloquence is quietly rewarding.Nevertheless,it really succeeds with its warm treatment of ordinary hang-ups like no life-shattering revelations or pain repressed since childhood, just the genuine, everyday trials of life.Also,this coming of age tale is about guys in their 20's who refuse or are unable to mature as evidenced by the captivating relationship is between Timothy Hutton and the 13-year-old Natalie Portman,which steals all scenes and it is a delight.This is definitely a smart film about relationships and growing older that's funny and smart that many would surely enjoy.

    This is one of my favorite movies of all time. To expand the meaning of never judge a book by it's cover is such. The title kept me from watching it until a few years ago. When it was over, i hit play and watched it again. This movie is so genuine and heartfelt and real. It's loaded with a great cast and great quotes. "Beautiful girls" is a romantic comedy at heart but not just a chick flick. Guys will also enjoy it. So to anyone who has not seen it yet, i urge you to watch. It will make you laugh and cry but most of all should leave you feeling happy. This movie also has some of the greatest lines i have ever heard in a movie. One of my favorite characters is played by actor "Michael Rappaport." Some of his scenes i have lived by. The soundtrack to this movie is one of the best. So a perfect movie and perfect soundtrack, what more can you ask for?

    Beautiful Girls has a great story line and good characters. The plot is something anyone would be interested and relate to, and it is well acted. I really wish the dialogue were written by someone maybe a little more "earthy." There are some pretty cringe-worthy moments. In trying to capture a feeling of "bro" behavior, some of the dialog rings false, like it was either written by a woman who does not spend a lot of time with these types of men, or a man who does not have these kinds of friends. I know many men like the ones portrayed in the movie: trapped in their own self-defeating fantasies and not particularly successful. If one of them began a conversation like the ones in the film, his friends would think he was speaking in a different language. I know Uma Thurman was cast as the token "beautiful girl" yet some of the lines she said just sounded silly, maybe like contrived intelligent remarks. There are many highly intelligent and precociously funny teens like Natalie Portman, but they would have never said things like "daddy downer and brother bummer." That is the vernacular of a forty year old screenwriter. For a more realistic portrayal of the sharply sarcastic teen, watch Juno. I have taught for years and can see a vast difference in the two characters meant to appeal to older men. "Bros" like these would rather stick a needle in their eye rather than sit around a piano to sing "Sweet Caroline" to a girl they want to impress. Of all the dialogue and scenes, that seems the most artificial and contrived. I wish it were taken out of the film. I also have a few superficial quibbles...the actors do look much too old for a 10 year reunion. I am really ashamed of this particular complaint...but I sort of wish the characters had more 90's era style...to add some nostalgia. No one has any style. Also the soundtrack is horrific. However, it is very watchable overall.

    I was actually dreading to watch this movie since most similar genre movies end up to be melodramatic, preachy and finally sappy. My expectation started to turn out true with an irritating opening song through the credits and character introductions, but like the movie - I couldn't get the song out of my head now. Be it Michael Rapaport's unending bickering and whining, suave looks of Uma Thurman and then a masterstroke in a mature than her age teenager role of Natalie Portman. Adding her performance with 'Leon - The Professional', Natalie Portman is yesteryear's Chloe Mortez - but that is being generous for Chloe. Every serious, melodramatic moment has a fresh twist to make it entertaining, every character superbly defined and stay true to their character till the end. It was all in all an excellent ensemble performance from all involved appraising an equally well written script. Willie (Timothy Hutton) is at a crossroads with his career going nowhere as a musician and his relationship stuck due to his commitment phobia. He decides to comeback to his hometown to attend his high school reunion while catching up on his old friends Tommy (Matt Dillon), Mo (Noah Emmerich) and Paul (Michael Rapaport) each going through different phases in their life and relationships.

While the director treasures and elevates some key moments, also tries to keep it a little lighter and borderline quirky. What this movie required was not great performances but spontaneous ones and gets plenty of them from the able cast, especially little Natalie Portman. The background score could have been better except for the irritatingly catchy opening song which is used extensively throughout the movie. There is a little lull somewhere before the last quarter part of the movie, but picks up quite well leading to a predictable yet well executed finish.

    This is one of my favorite movies of all time. To expand the meaning of never judge a book by it's cover is such. The title kept me from watching it until a few years ago. When it was over, i hit play and watched it again. This movie is so genuine and heartfelt and real. It's loaded with a great cast and great quotes. "Beautiful girls" is a romantic comedy at heart but not just a chick flick. Guys will also enjoy it. So to anyone who has not seen it yet, i urge you to watch. It will make you laugh and cry but most of all should leave you feeling happy. This movie also has some of the greatest lines i have ever heard in a movie. One of my favorite characters is played by actor "Michael Rappaport." Some of his scenes i have lived by. The soundtrack to this movie is one of the best. So a perfect movie and perfect soundtrack, what more can you ask for?

    Beautiful Girls has a great story line and good characters. The plot is something anyone would be interested and relate to, and it is well acted. I really wish the dialogue were written by someone maybe a little more "earthy." There are some pretty cringe-worthy moments. In trying to capture a feeling of "bro" behavior, some of the dialog rings false, like it was either written by a woman who does not spend a lot of time with these types of men, or a man who does not have these kinds of friends. I know many men like the ones portrayed in the movie: trapped in their own self-defeating fantasies and not particularly successful. If one of them began a conversation like the ones in the film, his friends would think he was speaking in a different language. I know Uma Thurman was cast as the token "beautiful girl" yet some of the lines she said just sounded silly, maybe like contrived intelligent remarks. There are many highly intelligent and precociously funny teens like Natalie Portman, but they would have never said things like "daddy downer and brother bummer." That is the vernacular of a forty year old screenwriter. For a more realistic portrayal of the sharply sarcastic teen, watch Juno. I have taught for years and can see a vast difference in the two characters meant to appeal to older men. "Bros" like these would rather stick a needle in their eye rather than sit around a piano to sing "Sweet Caroline" to a girl they want to impress. Of all the dialogue and scenes, that seems the most artificial and contrived. I wish it were taken out of the film. I also have a few superficial quibbles...the actors do look much too old for a 10 year reunion. I am really ashamed of this particular complaint...but I sort of wish the characters had more 90's era style...to add some nostalgia. No one has any style. Also the soundtrack is horrific. However, it is very watchable overall.

    I was actually dreading to watch this movie since most similar genre movies end up to be melodramatic, preachy and finally sappy. My expectation started to turn out true with an irritating opening song through the credits and character introductions, but like the movie - I couldn't get the song out of my head now. Be it Michael Rapaport's unending bickering and whining, suave looks of Uma Thurman and then a masterstroke in a mature than her age teenager role of Natalie Portman. Adding her performance with 'Leon - The Professional', Natalie Portman is yesteryear's Chloe Mortez - but that is being generous for Chloe. Every serious, melodramatic moment has a fresh twist to make it entertaining, every character superbly defined and stay true to their character till the end. It was all in all an excellent ensemble performance from all involved appraising an equally well written script. Willie (Timothy Hutton) is at a crossroads with his career going nowhere as a musician and his relationship stuck due to his commitment phobia. He decides to comeback to his hometown to attend his high school reunion while catching up on his old friends Tommy (Matt Dillon), Mo (Noah Emmerich) and Paul (Michael Rapaport) each going through different phases in their life and relationships. When Willie thinks nothing could go any worse, he falls for a 13 year old Marty (Natalie Portman). There is a wicked sense of humor here commonly not associated with movies of that era. While the director treasures and elevates some key moments, also tries to keep it a little lighter and borderline quirky. What this movie required was not great performances but spontaneous ones and gets plenty of them from the able cast, especially little Natalie Portman. The background score could have been better except for the irritatingly catchy opening song which is used extensively throughout the movie. There is a little lull somewhere before the last quarter part of the movie, but picks up quite well leading to a predictable yet well executed finish.

    It was fun seeing the "new young acting talent" of 1996 in a way. (Remember the movie "Singles"?) Timothy Hutton and Natalie Portman have the best roles, but these too are one-dimensional and formulaic. If you want to see a much more realistic treatment of these themes please see the obscure independent film "Mulletville." You won't be disappointed. But the script here--ye gods! It has Rosie O'Donnell telling the male characters that "real women" should look like her (!) and that men should quit admiring "supermodels." Would you like a date with Rosie O'? The basic plot of the movie is that young rowdy small-town men need to "give up' their "irresponsible" hell-raising and "settle down" with "realistic" women who don't look very pretty or glamorous.(Including Timothy Hutton's lawyer-girlfriend-- a lawyer girlfriend so "responsible"!) Well--in the economy of the past 10 years--2002-2012 --people do not get to "settle down." --Their lives are too economically marginal!! Any average SEINFIELD episode is more realistic than this movie. And very few women actually want to look like Rosie O'Donnell (!). The script is so preachy: --The "bad girl" --a married woman having an affair with her ex-boyfriend --is made up to look harsh and unsympathetic and she's portrayed as a neglectful mother too, deserving punishment. --Maybe in REAL life she has her own frustrations. Maybe she even likes her children if not her husband. This film's simplistic "morality" reminds me of the Gangster and Cowboy films of the 1930s--the guys are all hell-raisers running close to the wrong side of the law, but then their girlfriend has a baby and they "learn responsibility" --and then her Dad takes the guy into the family business and they "raise a family.". Yeah--right. That world ended in the 1950s, if it ever really existed. So--what was your life like in 1996?--not like this movie I bet.

    Willy (Timothy Hutton), a piano player in Chicago, goes back to his small hometown for a class reunion. He meets up with his old friends. One is Tom (Matt Dillon) who has an anorexic girlfriend (Mira Sorvino) AND is being chased around by a married woman (Lauren Holly). Another is Paul (Michael Rapaport) who has been dumped by his girlfriend Jan (Martha Plimpton) because he won't marry her. Naturally he wants her back. Willy himself meets precocious 13 year old (Natalie Portman who was actually 17 when she did this) and starts falling for HER even though he has a wonderful girlfriend (Annabeth Gish)! Uma Thurman (looking great) pops up and Rose O'Donnell (not sure WHO she's playing) shows up to provide some much needed humor. This is not a deep meaningful movie. The problems (and characters) are familiar as are the outcomes. However this IS well-written and it has a cast of great actors who pull it all through. I was honestly never bored and it was a shock seeing Portman so young. Also there's one sequence that stops the movie when O'Donnell tells off Willy and Tom about sex, woman and relationships. O'Donnell is right on target here and hilarious. It was beautifully filmed (in Nova Scotia I believe) and has a great soundtrack. It's not perfect though. Rapaport's character got on my nerves quickly and there's a far too brutal beating at the end that just wasn't needed (and treats a main character far too cruelly). Still it is a very good movie with a wonderful cast. A perfect date movie. I give it a 7.

    Sorry but this movie made me want to kill myself . I LOVED Rosie O' Donnels performance and her speech in the drugstore made me hopeful that this movie was going to be about preaching that little thing called INNER beauty . NOT the case . No matter how many times a character was told this is the case , a better argument was made for the opposite . A pleasant surprise was seeing a young Natalie Portman , her timing ,amazing. We are ALL going to get older and we will ALL lose our beauty , even MODELS .We will ALL be replaced on the desire meter . And this movie was a sad reminder . NOT a feel-good movie . Be warned women .

    I absolutely LOVE this movie. And this is coming from someone who loves Scarface, Good Fellas, Apocalypse Now, Casino, James Bond, etc. Yea...it's that good. How many times have you seen a feel good movie only to realize that feel good must mean stupid, sappy, crappy waste of time? Beautiful Girls is a feel good movie that will actually make you feel good. There are so many awesome performances in this movie that it would not be fair to mention any specifically. However Timothy Hutton in the star role is wonderful and you can't help but fall in love with Natalie Portman. A group of friends get together and start taking stock of their lives. Romance, conflicts, drama, humor, this film has it all, as well as Uma Thurman. Great script, great acting, great fun. This movie will disappoint no one. Watch it with your boyfriend. He will enjoy it, even if he says he doesn't. Share it with your girlfriend, and she will love you forever. Simply wonderful.

    Beautiful "Underrated" Girls

    I had never heard of Beautiful Girls three years ago. After seeing portions of it then, I had always "caught" either the middle of the film, the very ending or somewhere between the opening credits and closing music. Though never seeing the movie in it's entirety until October 2010, (finally), I have always been fascinated by it, enthralled and completely sucked in to it, grasping at every spoken word, every poignant, touching scene; laughing, crying and basically loving every moment of this highly underrated movie. Even the little snowy "Ridge" town, somewhere in Minnepolis is just the perfect setting for the reunion of high school pals, Tommy, Willy, Kev, Mo and Paul. I am not exactly sure why, but this movie touches my very heart and soul, not so much that I can relate to the characters, the locale (I being a Southern California boy) or even the happy, drunken camaraderie of the friends of The Ridge, but there is a reality about it that just keeps you hanging on to every word and moment. Timothy Hutton is as usual, brilliant as Willy, the buddy who moved away from The Ridge to become a working piano player. His taboo, yet innocent relationship with Marty, a 13 year old girl who is an old soul, wise beyond her years is so touching,and his scenes with Andera in the bar and ice fishing shack, played wonderfully by Uma Thurmond are worthy of rewinding over and over and over again. I have yet to purchase this movie and but I guarantee when I do there will be a ton of rewinding and even more repeated viewing. So I urge you all, search for this movie at home, or better yet, buy it on DVD, sit down in front of the TV on a chilly fall or winter night (with a bottle of wine if you're of the age), in front of the warm glow of the fire and experience in my humble opinion, a great movie filled with characters you will love, some you may "know" and some you may not care for too much at all, but trust me, you will love this movie.
