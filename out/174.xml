    I had a blast watching Raiders of the Lost Ark and it definitely has a lot of great aspects that make it such a beloved adventure film. There is a fair amount of genuinely funny scenes and some excellent thrills. John Williams' score is memorable as always and the action sequences were handled very well. Harrison Ford is terrific as Indiana Jones and just transmits a sense of coolness, always having a strong screen presence. I thought the other actors were pretty good and gave convincing performances, but Ford is definitely the one who really stands out here. Raiders of the Lost Ark is a great action flick, having plenty of suspenseful, comical, iconic moments and it's not to be missed.

    Professor Indiana Jones was introduced to the world here, and thanks to the genius of George Lucas and the fantastic direction of the legendary Steven Spielberg, it will be remembered forever. "Raiders of the Lost Ark" was the masterpiece who not only launched the legendary saga of adventure and the fantastic history of the unforgettable Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford), but also invented the cinema's entertainment, all thanks to a revolutionized and classic story! Early on we see this man who seems to be a cowboy (cowboy hat, a revolver, a whip, daah). We see him and a small group of Latinos venturing in the jungles of South America, soon the audience knows that he is searching for an ancient treasure entering into a cave. There he is faced with several decaying corpses and discovers that the whole room is full of traps. After getting out the golden statue of his precious place, he burst out run and we received the classic chase scene of a huge round stone. After our hero get-away, but he just falls into another deadly trap by a competitor. Our hero escapes again, and later we discoveres that the movie story takes place on the year of 1936, before the second Great War, and our hero is called Indiana Jones and he is a professor and archaeologist who works for a museum. Then, Jones learns about a biblical artifact called "The Ark of the Covenant" from the healer of the museum and also discovers that this artifact might hold the key to human existence and the powers of god. Now Jones embarks on this adventure to great places ranging from the mountains of Nepal to the deserts of Egypt with the help of his former lover Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen). However, he will have to fight against his competitor Renee Belloq (Paul Freeman) and an army of Nazis in order to reach it. The whole story since the very beginning became a classic thanks to Lawrence Kasdan's writing improving by every minute of the film, delivering great dialog explanations of the historical artifacts in the film are very realistic and very simple, leaving the viewer feeling pretty smart. Not only with artifacts explanations that the scripts stands out, but delivers us several humoristic moments with a really smart and fun humor, full of cultural references of the time of the story. But not only humor that makes and revolutionize the movie, but is the change of tone, giving really dark and serious moments to Indi's journey across the globe. Speaking of Indi again, that is another character made by Lucas and starring Harrison Ford that sticks in our minds forever. While in the "Star Wars" trilogy we have the funny and unforgettable Lando, here like I said before we have professor Indiana Jones badass, smart and once again unforgettable. Both of then became legendary, but Indi is the one that we never had seen before, and till today makes you think. At that time, people never had seen a hero that is a human like any other, getting punched; shoot at; throw at a river of snakes, by every passing minute, but always getting out of the situations full of scars and bleeding. And Indi is a character that make's humor and jokes of the situations that he is presented (not like Lando who delivers badass phrases by every minute). The script (considered one of the best ever written for a film) is excellent, but in technical aspects the movie is marvelous. Spielberg's direction nor comments, delivering chase sequences and action scenes that are breathtaking and are extremely fun, and also feeling really realistic. Everything bathed with John William's unforgettable soundtrack that gets stuck in your head forever (and ever since only made Star Wars soundtracks and every single Spielberg movie). A unforgettable classic that began one of the best trilogies ever made and it will live forever, thanks to a marvelous direction of Spielberg; superb writing; unforgettable character with an amazing performance from Ford. The masterpiece that invented cinema's entertainment, but none entertainment movie of today hold a candle close to this beautiful blend of a serious story with James Bond style and "The Treasure of sierra Madre" quest all with great quality that show's Lucas and Spielberg minds working together is still today considered a adventure's masterpiece. 10/10

    Review #5 of "My Top Ten Favorite Movies" Reviews "Spielberg can never top this. Period." - Luke Y. Thompson, Dallas Observer Luke is right. This is the best Spielberg film as of yet. I don't believe he can top this. The movie's charm and adventure just captivate you and fully engage you in the movie. It works like clockwork. This film combines adventure, greed, power, love, Nazis, Harrison Ford at his best, and many other things to make the best adventure film ever made. All the actors seem to enjoy their roles, and I especially love Paul Freeman's crazy French archaeologist character, Belloq. There are many iconic scenes here; the boulder chase scene, the plane explosion, the U-boat scene, the "kidnapped Marion" scene, the "Indy-shoots-the-guy-with-the-sword" scene, and of course the melting faces scene. I could go on and on. You will like every moment of this movie, and will want more. Since you want more, you have 3 almost-as-good sequels to watch! HandHStudios Rating: 10/10

    Harrison Ford makes his first appearance as Indiana Jones in this exciting, highly entertaining globe-trotting adventure, which finds archaeologist and college professor Jones pursuing Nazis who are searching for the Ark of the Covenant, with which they hope to use its mystical powers to help them conquer the world in Pre-World War II[1936] days. Harrison Ford became a huge star in his own right(not just as Han Solo) and is highly appealing and capable, really making Indiana come to life in this fantastic story, helped by a fine cast featuring Karen Allen, John Rhys Davies, and Denholm Elliot. Steven Spielberg directs in a breathless and inspired way, and this film is great fun(just don't ponder its credibility too closely...)

    As a kid I liked very much the adventure movies and all of these staff. I liked movies that had action, adventure and suspense, "Raiders of the Lost Ark" has all of that and that's why I consider this movie as the definition of an adventure movie. Steven Spielberg creates an another masterpiece with Harrison Ford as starring. The subject of this great movie is the search of the Lost Arc. Harrison Ford plays as Indiana Jones who is an archaeologist and adventurer who is hired by the government of the U.S to find it before of the Nazi. This movie harmoniously combines adventure and action with love and comedy, it's a movie that you will want to see it again and again.

    To me this is just about PERFECT. Harrison Ford has never really been BETTER (and as everyone knows he was HAN SOLO for heaven's sake & DECKARD in 'Blade Runner') he was BORN TO PLAY INDIANA JONES!!! Karen Allen is a most WONDERFUL Damsel in distress (Very cute too) The rest of the ensemble cast is spot on. Direction from Mr Steven Spielberg is dramatic & highly INVENTIVE. The Nazi's (Boo Boo) are looking for the ARK of the Covenant & it's mighty SUPERNATURAL powers that come with it & this makes for a great fun roller-coaster ride. The SPECIAL EFFECTS & Big Set-Pieces are AMAZING...and they come thick & fast. Should they make a 5th INDY Film then let's just hope they go back to this & the 3rd film's (THE LAST CRUSADE) tone as they're the better of the four made so far (although TEMPLE of DOOM & THE CRYSTAL SKULL are both super fun too) RAIDERS is right up there as one of my Favourite movies of ALL-TIME & i'm sure will be entertaining people when i'm long gone!

    "Raiders of the Lost Ark", the beginning of the Indiana Jones saga, is truly a movie that has stood the test of time. Harrison Ford as Jones is the perfect choice for this role, and we see him in the jungles of South America, a college class room, Nepal, Egypt, and a secret Nazi controlled island. There is a fellow archaeologist Dr. Rene Belloq or Belloq played by Paul Freeman, who is Jones enemy. Belloq and Jones race to find the Ark of the Covenant. Belloq enlist the help of the Nazis. Jones enlists the help of Marion Ravenwood played by Karen Allen, who is an ex-girlfriend. Jones also enlist the help of a friend Sallah played by John Rhys-Davies. Belloq and the Nazis plan to use the Ark for evil and world domination. Jones, Marion, And Sallah are out to stop Belloq and the Nazis. The theme of "Raiders of the Lost Ark" is good vs. evil. Jones, Marion, and Sallah play the role of the good guys while Belloq and the Nazis are the bad guys. Bellog role as evil or bad guy is reinforced by his willingness to stop at nothing to get what he wants, the statue, the ark, and Marion. Once the mention of the Nazi army and Hitler are mentioned we know they are the bad guys. This is based symbolism Nazis and Hitler. These words automatically invoke the thought of evil. Belloq and the Nazis are searching for the ark to use its power to rule the world. There is a line in the movie "No army that carried the ark has ever been defeated in battle." (Spielberg, 1981) "Raiders of the Lost Ark" uses sound to enhance the theme and settings. During action scenes in the movie when Jones is about to do something exceptional we here the same musical score. This score has become symbolic away from the movie and has been used in many situations in TV and film to stir fond memories. . .

    Being one of the first true adventure films to come out in years, Raiders of the Lost Ark is able to not only redefine the action genre as a whole, but be so well made that no film since it's release has been able to top it. When they stated on the poster that this movie was the return of the great adventure, they weren't kidding. What a lot of people aren't aware of is that Steven Spielberg and George Lucas created the Indiana Jones movies as a tribute to the classic adventure films and old film serials that came out during the Great Depression and World War II. Such films that were payed tribute to (or ripped off) were "Secret of the Incas", "The Treasure of Sierra Madre", "China", and "Gunga Din". In that regard, it not only does that job, but delivers a timeless movie. I could pop this movie in any day and enjoy it. It never gets old. These movies are about treasure hunting, exotic locations, and great action set pieces. Everything flows perfectly from scene to scene. There's just a perfect balance of drama, humor, action, and romance. It works on every level-- If you're able to let back and not be critical, this is a great experience that will take you back to the past. It's well worth your time and once you see it, you won't get enough of it. PS: Check out those other classic movies. They're fun to watch too.

    This movie is a 1930's adventure, nothing more. It does not hold deep meaning, or fascinating characters, or moral lessons. It's like the epic adventures you see in the old Disney comics. It's what Spielberg made before he developed the desire to make "meaningful" movies such as "The Color Purple" or "Schindler's List", with mixed success. So what is the story? Indiana Jones is shown trying to retrieve an idol in some remote forest peopled by savage natives, and fails. Then it shows him as a college professor teaching a class. Then he is hired to find the Ark Of The Covenant before Hitler does, and he travels to Nepal to find a woman who holds a medallion which holds the key to finding the Ark. Then she goes with him on a series of wild adventures. Basically the rest of the movie is a roller-coaster ride. There is little more realism than on the "A-Team" TV show (an example is where Indy is dragged under a speeding truck and yet uninjured). Yet it is an entertaining ride, fast-paced and something you like seeing repeatedly, as I did.

    The team up of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas sounded extraordinary during the late 70s and early 80s. The director of Jaws and Close Encounters of the Third Kind and the man who brought us Star Wars respectively were two of the biggest filmmakers in that era and the decision for them to collaborate on a motion picture was sure to gain high expectations. With Raiders of the Lost Ark, the first entry in the much lauded Indiana Jones saga, Spielberg and Lucas made a film that was reminiscent of the old action movie serials from the 1940s, just like how Star Wars was born out of Flash Gordon serials. Raiders revamped the old-fashioned approach of the genre, with a likable main character, a compelling romance, fun action, a witty screenplay and a rousing story. This remains one of Spielberg's most masterful directorial efforts and one of my favourite movies. After failing to retrieve a priceless artifact from a temple in the Amazon rainforest, archaeologist and teacher Indiana Jones and his colleague and friend Marcus are approached by two Army intelligence agents who inform them that the Nazis have become obsessed with obtaining occult power and are looking for Indy's former mentor Abner Ravenwood who lead an expedition to find the lost Egyptian city of Tanis and possesses the headpiece of the Staff of Ra. Indy then deduces that the Nazis are searching for Tanis in search of the fabled Ark of the Covenant; the chest created by the Hebrews that stored the fragments of the Ten Commandments. The Nazis believe that if they acquired it then their army would be invincible. The Staff of Ra is needed to unlock the Well of Souls where the Ark is hidden. Indy is assigned to reach the Ark before the Nazis do and travels to Nepal to talk to Abner's daughter Marion, who is also Indy's former lover. Indy learns from Marion that Abner died and that she has the headpiece to the Staff on her. When Nazi agents follow Indy to Marion's tavern, they wreak havoc and the tavern gets burned down. Marion agrees to accompany Indy to Egypt to help him find the Ark where they meet Indy's good friend Sallah and discover that Indy's rival, Rene Belloq, is involved in the Nazi digging operation outside of Cairo to locate the Well of Souls. Raiders of the Lost Ark is largely constructed out of the style of the old 40s movie serials. Indy always gets into a life-threatening situation but comes out relatively unscathed. Every moments that occurs is played out like a cliffhanger to a serial. However, despite the homages to those old-fashioned adventure tales, Spielberg and Lucas don't forget that the film needs an understanding of character to keep the viewer interested. I believe that Harrison Ford is about 80% responsible for making the character of Indy such a beloved hero. A departure from his more cynical and self-reliant Han Solo in Star Wars, Ford plays Indy as a no-nonsense hero who is also benevolent and caring to the people close to him. This particularly shows in his relationship with Marion. Despite their rocky start, the two begin to appreciate each other's company and their love for each other begins to spark again. In one scene where Indy believe Marion is dead, he is traumatized and guilt-ridden. Ford's charismatic light-hearted performance and the character's personality made him into an action movie icon. Karen Allen delivers a strong female opposite to Indy as Marion. Unlike most female leads in the old adventure films, she's actually a strong- willed character who pulls a few punches (her first scene punching Indy being a prime example). She is perhaps the best leading woman in the series and her absence in Temple of Doom and Last Crusade was one reason why they were marginally less impressive than this film. Paul Freeman as Belloq is a villain who seeks the Ark as a means for his own personal gain. Unlike the Nazis, all he requires is a simple payment and a case of recognition. He pulls off the charm well and isn't simply a megalomaniac with who seeks power. John-Rhys Davies as Sallah was what gained him a cult following before playing Gimli in Lord of the Rings. His performance as the good-natured friend to Indy provides some of the light-hearted moments in the film. John Williams, who composed the scores to Spielberg's previous successful features along with Lucas' Star Wars, crafted the score to this film. The upbeat and marching theme tune has become one of the mos iconic film scores of the past half century and is perhaps Williams' best known music behind Star Wars. Some of the film's finest moments also have become iconic moments in film history. The ad-libbed scene where Indy is confronted by a swordsman in Cairo and instead of confronting him in a duel, non-chalantly picks out his revolver and shoots him. The climactic scene of the Ark opening is one of the finest moments of gore in film and an awesome way to wrap up the story. Raiders of the Lost Ark is a fine piece of movie making that represents the re-imagining of a genre as well as two great directors coming together to craft such a wonderful piece of cinema. Just like Star Wars, Raiders paved the way for sequels that, whilst not as impressive, were still entertaining and fun adventure movies. Some intriguing supernatural elements along with some innovative visuals and action, a cynical and yet touching romance and most of all, an appealing leading man make this a tremendous experience and one film that I include on my all time favourites.

Should they make a 5th INDY Film then let's just hope they go back to this & the 3rd film's (THE LAST CRUSADE) tone as they're the better of the four made so far (although TEMPLE of DOOM & THE CRYSTAL SKULL are both super fun too) RAIDERS is right up there as one of my Favourite movies of ALL-TIME & i'm sure will be entertaining people when i'm long gone!

    "Raiders of the Lost Ark", the beginning of the Indiana Jones saga, is truly a movie that has stood the test of time. Harrison Ford as Jones is the perfect choice for this role, and we see him in the jungles of South America, a college class room, Nepal, Egypt, and a secret Nazi controlled island. There is a fellow archaeologist Dr. Rene Belloq or Belloq played by Paul Freeman, who is Jones enemy. Belloq and Jones race to find the Ark of the Covenant. Belloq enlist the help of the Nazis. Jones enlists the help of Marion Ravenwood played by Karen Allen, who is an ex-girlfriend. Jones also enlist the help of a friend Sallah played by John Rhys-Davies. Belloq and the Nazis plan to use the Ark for evil and world domination. Jones, Marion, And Sallah are out to stop Belloq and the Nazis. The theme of "Raiders of the Lost Ark" is good vs. evil. Jones, Marion, and Sallah play the role of the good guys while Belloq and the Nazis are the bad guys. Bellog role as evil or bad guy is reinforced by his willingness to stop at nothing to get what he wants, the statue, the ark, and Marion. Once the mention of the Nazi army and Hitler are mentioned we know they are the bad guys. This is based symbolism Nazis and Hitler. These words automatically invoke the thought of evil. Belloq and the Nazis are searching for the ark to use its power to rule the world. There is a line in the movie "No army that carried the ark has ever been defeated in battle." (Spielberg, 1981) "Raiders of the Lost Ark" uses sound to enhance the theme and settings. During action scenes in the movie when Jones is about to do something exceptional we here the same musical score. This score has become symbolic away from the movie and has been used in many situations in TV and film to stir fond memories. . .

    Being one of the first true adventure films to come out in years, Raiders of the Lost Ark is able to not only redefine the action genre as a whole, but be so well made that no film since it's release has been able to top it. When they stated on the poster that this movie was the return of the great adventure, they weren't kidding. What a lot of people aren't aware of is that Steven Spielberg and George Lucas created the Indiana Jones movies as a tribute to the classic adventure films and old film serials that came out during the Great Depression and World War II. Such films that were payed tribute to (or ripped off) were "Secret of the Incas", "The Treasure of Sierra Madre", "China", and "Gunga Din". In that regard, it not only does that job, but delivers a timeless movie. I could pop this movie in any day and enjoy it. It never gets old. These movies are about treasure hunting, exotic locations, and great action set pieces. Everything flows perfectly from scene to scene. There's just a perfect balance of drama, humor, action, and romance. It works on every level-- If you're able to let back and not be critical, this is a great experience that will take you back to the past. It's well worth your time and once you see it, you won't get enough of it. PS: Check out those other classic movies. They're fun to watch too.

    This movie is a 1930's adventure, nothing more. It does not hold deep meaning, or fascinating characters, or moral lessons. It's like the epic adventures you see in the old Disney comics. It's what Spielberg made before he developed the desire to make "meaningful" movies such as "The Color Purple" or "Schindler's List", with mixed success. So what is the story? Indiana Jones is shown trying to retrieve an idol in some remote forest peopled by savage natives, and fails. Then it shows him as a college professor teaching a class. Then he is hired to find the Ark Of The Covenant before Hitler does, and he travels to Nepal to find a woman who holds a medallion which holds the key to finding the Ark. Then she goes with him on a series of wild adventures. Basically the rest of the movie is a roller-coaster ride. There is little more realism than on the "A-Team" TV show (an example is where Indy is dragged under a speeding truck and yet uninjured). Yet it is an entertaining ride, fast-paced and something you like seeing repeatedly, as I did.

    The team up of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas sounded extraordinary during the late 70s and early 80s. The director of Jaws and Close Encounters of the Third Kind and the man who brought us Star Wars respectively were two of the biggest filmmakers in that era and the decision for them to collaborate on a motion picture was sure to gain high expectations. With Raiders of the Lost Ark, the first entry in the much lauded Indiana Jones saga, Spielberg and Lucas made a film that was reminiscent of the old action movie serials from the 1940s, just like how Star Wars was born out of Flash Gordon serials. Raiders revamped the old-fashioned approach of the genre, with a likable main character, a compelling romance, fun action, a witty screenplay and a rousing story. This remains one of Spielberg's most masterful directorial efforts and one of my favourite movies. After failing to retrieve a priceless artifact from a temple in the Amazon rainforest, archaeologist and teacher Indiana Jones and his colleague and friend Marcus are approached by two Army intelligence agents who inform them that the Nazis have become obsessed with obtaining occult power and are looking for Indy's former mentor Abner Ravenwood who lead an expedition to find the lost Egyptian city of Tanis and possesses the headpiece of the Staff of Ra. Indy then deduces that the Nazis are searching for Tanis in search of the fabled Ark of the Covenant; the chest created by the Hebrews that stored the fragments of the Ten Commandments. The Nazis believe that if they acquired it then their army would be invincible. The Staff of Ra is needed to unlock the Well of Souls where the Ark is hidden. Indy is assigned to reach the Ark before the Nazis do and travels to Nepal to talk to Abner's daughter Marion, who is also Indy's former lover. Indy learns from Marion that Abner died and that she has the headpiece to the Staff on her. When Nazi agents follow Indy to Marion's tavern, they wreak havoc and the tavern gets burned down. Marion agrees to accompany Indy to Egypt to help him find the Ark where they meet Indy's good friend Sallah and discover that Indy's rival, Rene Belloq, is involved in the Nazi digging operation outside of Cairo to locate the Well of Souls. Raiders of the Lost Ark is largely constructed out of the style of the old 40s movie serials. Indy always gets into a life-threatening situation but comes out relatively unscathed. Every moments that occurs is played out like a cliffhanger to a serial. However, despite the homages to those old-fashioned adventure tales, Spielberg and Lucas don't forget that the film needs an understanding of character to keep the viewer interested. I believe that Harrison Ford is about 80% responsible for making the character of Indy such a beloved hero. A departure from his more cynical and self-reliant Han Solo in Star Wars, Ford plays Indy as a no-nonsense hero who is also benevolent and caring to the people close to him. This particularly shows in his relationship with Marion. Despite their rocky start, the two begin to appreciate each other's company and their love for each other begins to spark again. In one scene where Indy believe Marion is dead, he is traumatized and guilt-ridden. Ford's charismatic light-hearted performance and the character's personality made him into an action movie icon. Karen Allen delivers a strong female opposite to Indy as Marion. Unlike most female leads in the old adventure films, she's actually a strong- willed character who pulls a few punches (her first scene punching Indy being a prime example). She is perhaps the best leading woman in the series and her absence in Temple of Doom and Last Crusade was one reason why they were marginally less impressive than this film. Paul Freeman as Belloq is a villain who seeks the Ark as a means for his own personal gain. Unlike the Nazis, all he requires is a simple payment and a case of recognition. He pulls off the charm well and isn't simply a megalomaniac with who seeks power. John-Rhys Davies as Sallah was what gained him a cult following before playing Gimli in Lord of the Rings. His performance as the good-natured friend to Indy provides some of the light-hearted moments in the film. John Williams, who composed the scores to Spielberg's previous successful features along with Lucas' Star Wars, crafted the score to this film. The upbeat and marching theme tune has become one of the mos iconic film scores of the past half century and is perhaps Williams' best known music behind Star Wars. Some of the film's finest moments also have become iconic moments in film history. The ad-libbed scene where Indy is confronted by a swordsman in Cairo and instead of confronting him in a duel, non-chalantly picks out his revolver and shoots him. The climactic scene of the Ark opening is one of the finest moments of gore in film and an awesome way to wrap up the story. Raiders of the Lost Ark is a fine piece of movie making that represents the re-imagining of a genre as well as two great directors coming together to craft such a wonderful piece of cinema. Just like Star Wars, Raiders paved the way for sequels that, whilst not as impressive, were still entertaining and fun adventure movies. Some intriguing supernatural elements along with some innovative visuals and action, a cynical and yet touching romance and most of all, an appealing leading man make this a tremendous experience and one film that I include on my all time favourites.

    I had a blast watching Raiders of the Lost Ark and it definitely has a lot of great aspects that make it such a beloved adventure film. There is a fair amount of genuinely funny scenes and some excellent thrills. John Williams' score is memorable as always and the action sequences were handled very well. Harrison Ford is terrific as Indiana Jones and just transmits a sense of coolness, always having a strong screen presence. I thought the other actors were pretty good and gave convincing performances, but Ford is definitely the one who really stands out here. Raiders of the Lost Ark is a great action flick, having plenty of suspenseful, comical, iconic moments and it's not to be missed.

    Professor Indiana Jones was introduced to the world here, and thanks to the genius of George Lucas and the fantastic direction of the legendary Steven Spielberg, it will be remembered forever. "Raiders of the Lost Ark" was the masterpiece who not only launched the legendary saga of adventure and the fantastic history of the unforgettable Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford), but also invented the cinema's entertainment, all thanks to a revolutionized and classic story! Early on we see this man who seems to be a cowboy (cowboy hat, a revolver, a whip, daah). We see him and a small group of Latinos venturing in the jungles of South America, soon the audience knows that he is searching for an ancient treasure entering into a cave. There he is faced with several decaying corpses and discovers that the whole room is full of traps. After getting out the golden statue of his precious place, he burst out run and we received the classic chase scene of a huge round stone. After our hero get-away, but he just falls into another deadly trap by a competitor. Our hero escapes again, and later we discoveres that the movie story takes place on the year of 1936, before the second Great War, and our hero is called Indiana Jones and he is a professor and archaeologist who works for a museum. Then, Jones learns about a biblical artifact called "The Ark of the Covenant" from the healer of the museum and also discovers that this artifact might hold the key to human existence and the powers of god. Now Jones embarks on this adventure to great places ranging from the mountains of Nepal to the deserts of Egypt with the help of his former lover Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen). However, he will have to fight against his competitor Renee Belloq (Paul Freeman) and an army of Nazis in order to reach it. The whole story since the very beginning became a classic thanks to Lawrence Kasdan's writing improving by every minute of the film, delivering great dialog explanations of the historical artifacts in the film are very realistic and very simple, leaving the viewer feeling pretty smart. Not only with artifacts explanations that the scripts stands out, but delivers us several humoristic moments with a really smart and fun humor, full of cultural references of the time of the story. But not only humor that makes and revolutionize the movie, but is the change of tone, giving really dark and serious moments to Indi's journey across the globe. Speaking of Indi again, that is another character made by Lucas and starring Harrison Ford that sticks in our minds forever. While in the "Star Wars" trilogy we have the funny and unforgettable Lando, here like I said before we have professor Indiana Jones badass, smart and once again unforgettable. Both of then became legendary, but Indi is the one that we never had seen before, and till today makes you think. At that time, people never had seen a hero that is a human like any other, getting punched; shoot at; throw at a river of snakes, by every passing minute, but always getting out of the situations full of scars and bleeding. And Indi is a character that make's humor and jokes of the situations that he is presented (not like Lando who delivers badass phrases by every minute). The script (considered one of the best ever written for a film) is excellent, but in technical aspects the movie is marvelous. Spielberg's direction nor comments, delivering chase sequences and action scenes that are breathtaking and are extremely fun, and also feeling really realistic. Everything bathed with John William's unforgettable soundtrack that gets stuck in your head forever (and ever since only made Star Wars soundtracks and every single Spielberg movie). A unforgettable classic that began one of the best trilogies ever made and it will live forever, thanks to a marvelous direction of Spielberg; superb writing; unforgettable character with an amazing performance from Ford. The masterpiece that invented cinema's entertainment, but none entertainment movie of today hold a candle close to this beautiful blend of a serious story with James Bond style and "The Treasure of sierra Madre" quest all with great quality that show's Lucas and Spielberg minds working together is still today considered a adventure's masterpiece. 10/10

    Review #5 of "My Top Ten Favorite Movies" Reviews "Spielberg can never top this. Period." - Luke Y. Thompson, Dallas Observer Luke is right. This is the best Spielberg film as of yet. I don't believe he can top this. The movie's charm and adventure just captivate you and fully engage you in the movie. It works like clockwork. This film combines adventure, greed, power, love, Nazis, Harrison Ford at his best, and many other things to make the best adventure film ever made. All the actors seem to enjoy their roles, and I especially love Paul Freeman's crazy French archaeologist character, Belloq. There are many iconic scenes here; the boulder chase scene, the plane explosion, the U-boat scene, the "kidnapped Marion" scene, the "Indy-shoots-the-guy-with-the-sword" scene, and of course the melting faces scene. I could go on and on. You will like every moment of this movie, and will want more. Since you want more, you have 3 almost-as-good sequels to watch! HandHStudios Rating: 10/10

    Harrison Ford makes his first appearance as Indiana Jones in this exciting, highly entertaining globe-trotting adventure, which finds archaeologist and college professor Jones pursuing Nazis who are searching for the Ark of the Covenant, with which they hope to use its mystical powers to help them conquer the world in Pre-World War II[1936] days. Harrison Ford became a huge star in his own right(not just as Han Solo) and is highly appealing and capable, really making Indiana come to life in this fantastic story, helped by a fine cast featuring Karen Allen, John Rhys Davies, and Denholm Elliot. Steven Spielberg directs in a breathless and inspired way, and this film is great fun(just don't ponder its credibility too closely...)

    As a kid I liked very much the adventure movies and all of these staff. I liked movies that had action, adventure and suspense, "Raiders of the Lost Ark" has all of that and that's why I consider this movie as the definition of an adventure movie. Steven Spielberg creates an another masterpiece with Harrison Ford as starring. The subject of this great movie is the search of the Lost Arc. Harrison Ford plays as Indiana Jones who is an archaeologist and adventurer who is hired by the government of the U.S to find it before of the Nazi. This movie harmoniously combines adventure and action with love and comedy, it's a movie that you will want to see it again and again.

    To me this is just about PERFECT. Harrison Ford has never really been BETTER (and as everyone knows he was HAN SOLO for heaven's sake & DECKARD in 'Blade Runner') he was BORN TO PLAY INDIANA JONES!!! Karen Allen is a most WONDERFUL Damsel in distress (Very cute too) The rest of the ensemble cast is spot on. Direction from Mr Steven Spielberg is dramatic & highly INVENTIVE. The Nazi's (Boo Boo) are looking for the ARK of the Covenant & it's mighty SUPERNATURAL powers that come with it & this makes for a great fun roller-coaster ride. The SPECIAL EFFECTS & Big Set-Pieces are AMAZING...and they come thick & fast. Should they make a 5th INDY Film then let's just hope they go back to this & the 3rd film's (THE LAST CRUSADE) tone as they're the better of the four made so far (although TEMPLE of DOOM & THE CRYSTAL SKULL are both super fun too) RAIDERS is right up there as one of my Favourite movies of ALL-TIME & i'm sure will be entertaining people when i'm long gone!

Raiders of the Lost Ark is a great action flick, having plenty of suspenseful, comical, iconic moments and it's not to be missed.

    Professor Indiana Jones was introduced to the world here, and thanks to the genius of George Lucas and the fantastic direction of the legendary Steven Spielberg, it will be remembered forever. "Raiders of the Lost Ark" was the masterpiece who not only launched the legendary saga of adventure and the fantastic history of the unforgettable Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford), but also invented the cinema's entertainment, all thanks to a revolutionized and classic story! Early on we see this man who seems to be a cowboy (cowboy hat, a revolver, a whip, daah). We see him and a small group of Latinos venturing in the jungles of South America, soon the audience knows that he is searching for an ancient treasure entering into a cave. There he is faced with several decaying corpses and discovers that the whole room is full of traps. After getting out the golden statue of his precious place, he burst out run and we received the classic chase scene of a huge round stone. After our hero get-away, but he just falls into another deadly trap by a competitor. Our hero escapes again, and later we discoveres that the movie story takes place on the year of 1936, before the second Great War, and our hero is called Indiana Jones and he is a professor and archaeologist who works for a museum. Then, Jones learns about a biblical artifact called "The Ark of the Covenant" from the healer of the museum and also discovers that this artifact might hold the key to human existence and the powers of god. Now Jones embarks on this adventure to great places ranging from the mountains of Nepal to the deserts of Egypt with the help of his former lover Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen). However, he will have to fight against his competitor Renee Belloq (Paul Freeman) and an army of Nazis in order to reach it. The whole story since the very beginning became a classic thanks to Lawrence Kasdan's writing improving by every minute of the film, delivering great dialog explanations of the historical artifacts in the film are very realistic and very simple, leaving the viewer feeling pretty smart. Not only with artifacts explanations that the scripts stands out, but delivers us several humoristic moments with a really smart and fun humor, full of cultural references of the time of the story. But not only humor that makes and revolutionize the movie, but is the change of tone, giving really dark and serious moments to Indi's journey across the globe. Speaking of Indi again, that is another character made by Lucas and starring Harrison Ford that sticks in our minds forever. While in the "Star Wars" trilogy we have the funny and unforgettable Lando, here like I said before we have professor Indiana Jones badass, smart and once again unforgettable. Both of then became legendary, but Indi is the one that we never had seen before, and till today makes you think. At that time, people never had seen a hero that is a human like any other, getting punched; shoot at; throw at a river of snakes, by every passing minute, but always getting out of the situations full of scars and bleeding. And Indi is a character that make's humor and jokes of the situations that he is presented (not like Lando who delivers badass phrases by every minute). The script (considered one of the best ever written for a film) is excellent, but in technical aspects the movie is marvelous. Spielberg's direction nor comments, delivering chase sequences and action scenes that are breathtaking and are extremely fun, and also feeling really realistic. Everything bathed with John William's unforgettable soundtrack that gets stuck in your head forever (and ever since only made Star Wars soundtracks and every single Spielberg movie). A unforgettable classic that began one of the best trilogies ever made and it will live forever, thanks to a marvelous direction of Spielberg; superb writing; unforgettable character with an amazing performance from Ford. The masterpiece that invented cinema's entertainment, but none entertainment movie of today hold a candle close to this beautiful blend of a serious story with James Bond style and "The Treasure of sierra Madre" quest all with great quality that show's Lucas and Spielberg minds working together is still today considered a adventure's masterpiece. 10/10

    Review #5 of "My Top Ten Favorite Movies" Reviews "Spielberg can never top this. Period." - Luke Y. Thompson, Dallas Observer Luke is right. This is the best Spielberg film as of yet. I don't believe he can top this. The movie's charm and adventure just captivate you and fully engage you in the movie. It works like clockwork. This film combines adventure, greed, power, love, Nazis, Harrison Ford at his best, and many other things to make the best adventure film ever made. All the actors seem to enjoy their roles, and I especially love Paul Freeman's crazy French archaeologist character, Belloq. There are many iconic scenes here; the boulder chase scene, the plane explosion, the U-boat scene, the "kidnapped Marion" scene, the "Indy-shoots-the-guy-with-the-sword" scene, and of course the melting faces scene. I could go on and on. You will like every moment of this movie, and will want more. Since you want more, you have 3 almost-as-good sequels to watch! HandHStudios Rating: 10/10

    Harrison Ford makes his first appearance as Indiana Jones in this exciting, highly entertaining globe-trotting adventure, which finds archaeologist and college professor Jones pursuing Nazis who are searching for the Ark of the Covenant, with which they hope to use its mystical powers to help them conquer the world in Pre-World War II[1936] days. Harrison Ford became a huge star in his own right(not just as Han Solo) and is highly appealing and capable, really making Indiana come to life in this fantastic story, helped by a fine cast featuring Karen Allen, John Rhys Davies, and Denholm Elliot. Steven Spielberg directs in a breathless and inspired way, and this film is great fun(just don't ponder its credibility too closely...)

    As a kid I liked very much the adventure movies and all of these staff. I liked movies that had action, adventure and suspense, "Raiders of the Lost Ark" has all of that and that's why I consider this movie as the definition of an adventure movie. Steven Spielberg creates an another masterpiece with Harrison Ford as starring. The subject of this great movie is the search of the Lost Arc. Harrison Ford plays as Indiana Jones who is an archaeologist and adventurer who is hired by the government of the U.S to find it before of the Nazi. This movie harmoniously combines adventure and action with love and comedy, it's a movie that you will want to see it again and again.

    To me this is just about PERFECT. Harrison Ford has never really been BETTER (and as everyone knows he was HAN SOLO for heaven's sake & DECKARD in 'Blade Runner') he was BORN TO PLAY INDIANA JONES!!! Karen Allen is a most WONDERFUL Damsel in distress (Very cute too) The rest of the ensemble cast is spot on. Direction from Mr Steven Spielberg is dramatic & highly INVENTIVE. The Nazi's (Boo Boo) are looking for the ARK of the Covenant & it's mighty SUPERNATURAL powers that come with it & this makes for a great fun roller-coaster ride. The SPECIAL EFFECTS & Big Set-Pieces are AMAZING...and they come thick & fast. Should they make a 5th INDY Film then let's just hope they go back to this & the 3rd film's (THE LAST CRUSADE) tone as they're the better of the four made so far (although TEMPLE of DOOM & THE CRYSTAL SKULL are both super fun too) RAIDERS is right up there as one of my Favourite movies of ALL-TIME & i'm sure will be entertaining people when i'm long gone!

    "Raiders of the Lost Ark", the beginning of the Indiana Jones saga, is truly a movie that has stood the test of time. Harrison Ford as Jones is the perfect choice for this role, and we see him in the jungles of South America, a college class room, Nepal, Egypt, and a secret Nazi controlled island. There is a fellow archaeologist Dr. Rene Belloq or Belloq played by Paul Freeman, who is Jones enemy. Belloq and Jones race to find the Ark of the Covenant. Belloq enlist the help of the Nazis. Jones enlists the help of Marion Ravenwood played by Karen Allen, who is an ex-girlfriend. Jones also enlist the help of a friend Sallah played by John Rhys-Davies. Belloq and the Nazis plan to use the Ark for evil and world domination. Jones, Marion, And Sallah are out to stop Belloq and the Nazis. The theme of "Raiders of the Lost Ark" is good vs. evil. Jones, Marion, and Sallah play the role of the good guys while Belloq and the Nazis are the bad guys. Bellog role as evil or bad guy is reinforced by his willingness to stop at nothing to get what he wants, the statue, the ark, and Marion. Once the mention of the Nazi army and Hitler are mentioned we know they are the bad guys. This is based symbolism Nazis and Hitler. These words automatically invoke the thought of evil. Belloq and the Nazis are searching for the ark to use its power to rule the world. There is a line in the movie "No army that carried the ark has ever been defeated in battle." (Spielberg, 1981) "Raiders of the Lost Ark" uses sound to enhance the theme and settings. During action scenes in the movie when Jones is about to do something exceptional we here the same musical score. This score has become symbolic away from the movie and has been used in many situations in TV and film to stir fond memories. . .

    Being one of the first true adventure films to come out in years, Raiders of the Lost Ark is able to not only redefine the action genre as a whole, but be so well made that no film since it's release has been able to top it. When they stated on the poster that this movie was the return of the great adventure, they weren't kidding. What a lot of people aren't aware of is that Steven Spielberg and George Lucas created the Indiana Jones movies as a tribute to the classic adventure films and old film serials that came out during the Great Depression and World War II. Such films that were payed tribute to (or ripped off) were "Secret of the Incas", "The Treasure of Sierra Madre", "China", and "Gunga Din". In that regard, it not only does that job, but delivers a timeless movie. I could pop this movie in any day and enjoy it. It never gets old. These movies are about treasure hunting, exotic locations, and great action set pieces. Everything flows perfectly from scene to scene. There's just a perfect balance of drama, humor, action, and romance. It works on every level-- If you're able to let back and not be critical, this is a great experience that will take you back to the past. It's well worth your time and once you see it, you won't get enough of it. PS: Check out those other classic movies. They're fun to watch too.

    This movie is a 1930's adventure, nothing more. It does not hold deep meaning, or fascinating characters, or moral lessons. It's like the epic adventures you see in the old Disney comics. It's what Spielberg made before he developed the desire to make "meaningful" movies such as "The Color Purple" or "Schindler's List", with mixed success. So what is the story? Indiana Jones is shown trying to retrieve an idol in some remote forest peopled by savage natives, and fails. Then it shows him as a college professor teaching a class. Then he is hired to find the Ark Of The Covenant before Hitler does, and he travels to Nepal to find a woman who holds a medallion which holds the key to finding the Ark. Then she goes with him on a series of wild adventures. Basically the rest of the movie is a roller-coaster ride. There is little more realism than on the "A-Team" TV show (an example is where Indy is dragged under a speeding truck and yet uninjured). Yet it is an entertaining ride, fast-paced and something you like seeing repeatedly, as I did.

    The team up of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas sounded extraordinary during the late 70s and early 80s. The director of Jaws and Close Encounters of the Third Kind and the man who brought us Star Wars respectively were two of the biggest filmmakers in that era and the decision for them to collaborate on a motion picture was sure to gain high expectations. With Raiders of the Lost Ark, the first entry in the much lauded Indiana Jones saga, Spielberg and Lucas made a film that was reminiscent of the old action movie serials from the 1940s, just like how Star Wars was born out of Flash Gordon serials. Raiders revamped the old-fashioned approach of the genre, with a likable main character, a compelling romance, fun action, a witty screenplay and a rousing story. This remains one of Spielberg's most masterful directorial efforts and one of my favourite movies. After failing to retrieve a priceless artifact from a temple in the Amazon rainforest, archaeologist and teacher Indiana Jones and his colleague and friend Marcus are approached by two Army intelligence agents who inform them that the Nazis have become obsessed with obtaining occult power and are looking for Indy's former mentor Abner Ravenwood who lead an expedition to find the lost Egyptian city of Tanis and possesses the headpiece of the Staff of Ra. Indy then deduces that the Nazis are searching for Tanis in search of the fabled Ark of the Covenant; the chest created by the Hebrews that stored the fragments of the Ten Commandments. The Nazis believe that if they acquired it then their army would be invincible. The Staff of Ra is needed to unlock the Well of Souls where the Ark is hidden. Indy is assigned to reach the Ark before the Nazis do and travels to Nepal to talk to Abner's daughter Marion, who is also Indy's former lover. Indy learns from Marion that Abner died and that she has the headpiece to the Staff on her. When Nazi agents follow Indy to Marion's tavern, they wreak havoc and the tavern gets burned down. Marion agrees to accompany Indy to Egypt to help him find the Ark where they meet Indy's good friend Sallah and discover that Indy's rival, Rene Belloq, is involved in the Nazi digging operation outside of Cairo to locate the Well of Souls. Raiders of the Lost Ark is largely constructed out of the style of the old 40s movie serials. Indy always gets into a life-threatening situation but comes out relatively unscathed. Every moments that occurs is played out like a cliffhanger to a serial. However, despite the homages to those old-fashioned adventure tales, Spielberg and Lucas don't forget that the film needs an understanding of character to keep the viewer interested. I believe that Harrison Ford is about 80% responsible for making the character of Indy such a beloved hero. A departure from his more cynical and self-reliant Han Solo in Star Wars, Ford plays Indy as a no-nonsense hero who is also benevolent and caring to the people close to him. This particularly shows in his relationship with Marion. Despite their rocky start, the two begin to appreciate each other's company and their love for each other begins to spark again. In one scene where Indy believe Marion is dead, he is traumatized and guilt-ridden. Ford's charismatic light-hearted performance and the character's personality made him into an action movie icon. Karen Allen delivers a strong female opposite to Indy as Marion. Unlike most female leads in the old adventure films, she's actually a strong- willed character who pulls a few punches (her first scene punching Indy being a prime example). She is perhaps the best leading woman in the series and her absence in Temple of Doom and Last Crusade was one reason why they were marginally less impressive than this film. Paul Freeman as Belloq is a villain who seeks the Ark as a means for his own personal gain. Unlike the Nazis, all he requires is a simple payment and a case of recognition. He pulls off the charm well and isn't simply a megalomaniac with who seeks power. John-Rhys Davies as Sallah was what gained him a cult following before playing Gimli in Lord of the Rings. His performance as the good-natured friend to Indy provides some of the light-hearted moments in the film. John Williams, who composed the scores to Spielberg's previous successful features along with Lucas' Star Wars, crafted the score to this film. The upbeat and marching theme tune has become one of the mos iconic film scores of the past half century and is perhaps Williams' best known music behind Star Wars. Some of the film's finest moments also have become iconic moments in film history. The ad-libbed scene where Indy is confronted by a swordsman in Cairo and instead of confronting him in a duel, non-chalantly picks out his revolver and shoots him. The climactic scene of the Ark opening is one of the finest moments of gore in film and an awesome way to wrap up the story. Raiders of the Lost Ark is a fine piece of movie making that represents the re-imagining of a genre as well as two great directors coming together to craft such a wonderful piece of cinema. Just like Star Wars, Raiders paved the way for sequels that, whilst not as impressive, were still entertaining and fun adventure movies. Some intriguing supernatural elements along with some innovative visuals and action, a cynical and yet touching romance and most of all, an appealing leading man make this a tremendous experience and one film that I include on my all time favourites.

    I had a blast watching Raiders of the Lost Ark and it definitely has a lot of great aspects that make it such a beloved adventure film. There is a fair amount of genuinely funny scenes and some excellent thrills. John Williams' score is memorable as always and the action sequences were handled very well. Harrison Ford is terrific as Indiana Jones and just transmits a sense of coolness, always having a strong screen presence. I thought the other actors were pretty good and gave convincing performances, but Ford is definitely the one who really stands out here.

    Being one of the first true adventure films to come out in years, Raiders of the Lost Ark is able to not only redefine the action genre as a whole, but be so well made that no film since it's release has been able to top it. When they stated on the poster that this movie was the return of the great adventure, they weren't kidding. What a lot of people aren't aware of is that Steven Spielberg and George Lucas created the Indiana Jones movies as a tribute to the classic adventure films and old film serials that came out during the Great Depression and World War II. Such films that were payed tribute to (or ripped off) were "Secret of the Incas", "The Treasure of Sierra Madre", "China", and "Gunga Din". In that regard, it not only does that job, but delivers a timeless movie. I could pop this movie in any day and enjoy it. It never gets old. These movies are about treasure hunting, exotic locations, and great action set pieces. Everything flows perfectly from scene to scene. There's just a perfect balance of drama, humor, action, and romance. It works on every level-- If you're able to let back and not be critical, this is a great experience that will take you back to the past. It's well worth your time and once you see it, you won't get enough of it. PS: Check out those other classic movies. They're fun to watch too.

    This movie is a 1930's adventure, nothing more. It does not hold deep meaning, or fascinating characters, or moral lessons. It's like the epic adventures you see in the old Disney comics. It's what Spielberg made before he developed the desire to make "meaningful" movies such as "The Color Purple" or "Schindler's List", with mixed success. So what is the story? Indiana Jones is shown trying to retrieve an idol in some remote forest peopled by savage natives, and fails. Then it shows him as a college professor teaching a class. Then he is hired to find the Ark Of The Covenant before Hitler does, and he travels to Nepal to find a woman who holds a medallion which holds the key to finding the Ark. Then she goes with him on a series of wild adventures. Basically the rest of the movie is a roller-coaster ride. There is little more realism than on the "A-Team" TV show (an example is where Indy is dragged under a speeding truck and yet uninjured). Yet it is an entertaining ride, fast-paced and something you like seeing repeatedly, as I did.

    The team up of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas sounded extraordinary during the late 70s and early 80s. The director of Jaws and Close Encounters of the Third Kind and the man who brought us Star Wars respectively were two of the biggest filmmakers in that era and the decision for them to collaborate on a motion picture was sure to gain high expectations. With Raiders of the Lost Ark, the first entry in the much lauded Indiana Jones saga, Spielberg and Lucas made a film that was reminiscent of the old action movie serials from the 1940s, just like how Star Wars was born out of Flash Gordon serials. Raiders revamped the old-fashioned approach of the genre, with a likable main character, a compelling romance, fun action, a witty screenplay and a rousing story. This remains one of Spielberg's most masterful directorial efforts and one of my favourite movies. After failing to retrieve a priceless artifact from a temple in the Amazon rainforest, archaeologist and teacher Indiana Jones and his colleague and friend Marcus are approached by two Army intelligence agents who inform them that the Nazis have become obsessed with obtaining occult power and are looking for Indy's former mentor Abner Ravenwood who lead an expedition to find the lost Egyptian city of Tanis and possesses the headpiece of the Staff of Ra. Indy then deduces that the Nazis are searching for Tanis in search of the fabled Ark of the Covenant; the chest created by the Hebrews that stored the fragments of the Ten Commandments. The Nazis believe that if they acquired it then their army would be invincible. The Staff of Ra is needed to unlock the Well of Souls where the Ark is hidden. Indy is assigned to reach the Ark before the Nazis do and travels to Nepal to talk to Abner's daughter Marion, who is also Indy's former lover. Indy learns from Marion that Abner died and that she has the headpiece to the Staff on her. When Nazi agents follow Indy to Marion's tavern, they wreak havoc and the tavern gets burned down. Marion agrees to accompany Indy to Egypt to help him find the Ark where they meet Indy's good friend Sallah and discover that Indy's rival, Rene Belloq, is involved in the Nazi digging operation outside of Cairo to locate the Well of Souls. Raiders of the Lost Ark is largely constructed out of the style of the old 40s movie serials. Indy always gets into a life-threatening situation but comes out relatively unscathed. Every moments that occurs is played out like a cliffhanger to a serial. However, despite the homages to those old-fashioned adventure tales, Spielberg and Lucas don't forget that the film needs an understanding of character to keep the viewer interested. I believe that Harrison Ford is about 80% responsible for making the character of Indy such a beloved hero. A departure from his more cynical and self-reliant Han Solo in Star Wars, Ford plays Indy as a no-nonsense hero who is also benevolent and caring to the people close to him. This particularly shows in his relationship with Marion. Despite their rocky start, the two begin to appreciate each other's company and their love for each other begins to spark again. In one scene where Indy believe Marion is dead, he is traumatized and guilt-ridden. Ford's charismatic light-hearted performance and the character's personality made him into an action movie icon. Karen Allen delivers a strong female opposite to Indy as Marion. Unlike most female leads in the old adventure films, she's actually a strong- willed character who pulls a few punches (her first scene punching Indy being a prime example). She is perhaps the best leading woman in the series and her absence in Temple of Doom and Last Crusade was one reason why they were marginally less impressive than this film. Paul Freeman as Belloq is a villain who seeks the Ark as a means for his own personal gain. Unlike the Nazis, all he requires is a simple payment and a case of recognition. He pulls off the charm well and isn't simply a megalomaniac with who seeks power. John-Rhys Davies as Sallah was what gained him a cult following before playing Gimli in Lord of the Rings. His performance as the good-natured friend to Indy provides some of the light-hearted moments in the film. John Williams, who composed the scores to Spielberg's previous successful features along with Lucas' Star Wars, crafted the score to this film. The upbeat and marching theme tune has become one of the mos iconic film scores of the past half century and is perhaps Williams' best known music behind Star Wars. Some of the film's finest moments also have become iconic moments in film history. The ad-libbed scene where Indy is confronted by a swordsman in Cairo and instead of confronting him in a duel, non-chalantly picks out his revolver and shoots him. The climactic scene of the Ark opening is one of the finest moments of gore in film and an awesome way to wrap up the story. Raiders of the Lost Ark is a fine piece of movie making that represents the re-imagining of a genre as well as two great directors coming together to craft such a wonderful piece of cinema. Just like Star Wars, Raiders paved the way for sequels that, whilst not as impressive, were still entertaining and fun adventure movies. Some intriguing supernatural elements along with some innovative visuals and action, a cynical and yet touching romance and most of all, an appealing leading man make this a tremendous experience and one film that I include on my all time favourites.

    I had a blast watching Raiders of the Lost Ark and it definitely has a lot of great aspects that make it such a beloved adventure film. There is a fair amount of genuinely funny scenes and some excellent thrills. John Williams' score is memorable as always and the action sequences were handled very well. Harrison Ford is terrific as Indiana Jones and just transmits a sense of coolness, always having a strong screen presence. I thought the other actors were pretty good and gave convincing performances, but Ford is definitely the one who really stands out here. Raiders of the Lost Ark is a great action flick, having plenty of suspenseful, comical, iconic moments and it's not to be missed.

    Professor Indiana Jones was introduced to the world here, and thanks to the genius of George Lucas and the fantastic direction of the legendary Steven Spielberg, it will be remembered forever. "Raiders of the Lost Ark" was the masterpiece who not only launched the legendary saga of adventure and the fantastic history of the unforgettable Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford), but also invented the cinema's entertainment, all thanks to a revolutionized and classic story! Early on we see this man who seems to be a cowboy (cowboy hat, a revolver, a whip, daah). We see him and a small group of Latinos venturing in the jungles of South America, soon the audience knows that he is searching for an ancient treasure entering into a cave. There he is faced with several decaying corpses and discovers that the whole room is full of traps. After getting out the golden statue of his precious place, he burst out run and we received the classic chase scene of a huge round stone. After our hero get-away, but he just falls into another deadly trap by a competitor. Our hero escapes again, and later we discoveres that the movie story takes place on the year of 1936, before the second Great War, and our hero is called Indiana Jones and he is a professor and archaeologist who works for a museum. Then, Jones learns about a biblical artifact called "The Ark of the Covenant" from the healer of the museum and also discovers that this artifact might hold the key to human existence and the powers of god. Now Jones embarks on this adventure to great places ranging from the mountains of Nepal to the deserts of Egypt with the help of his former lover Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen). However, he will have to fight against his competitor Renee Belloq (Paul Freeman) and an army of Nazis in order to reach it. The whole story since the very beginning became a classic thanks to Lawrence Kasdan's writing improving by every minute of the film, delivering great dialog explanations of the historical artifacts in the film are very realistic and very simple, leaving the viewer feeling pretty smart. Not only with artifacts explanations that the scripts stands out, but delivers us several humoristic moments with a really smart and fun humor, full of cultural references of the time of the story. But not only humor that makes and revolutionize the movie, but is the change of tone, giving really dark and serious moments to Indi's journey across the globe. Speaking of Indi again, that is another character made by Lucas and starring Harrison Ford that sticks in our minds forever. While in the "Star Wars" trilogy we have the funny and unforgettable Lando, here like I said before we have professor Indiana Jones badass, smart and once again unforgettable. Both of then became legendary, but Indi is the one that we never had seen before, and till today makes you think. At that time, people never had seen a hero that is a human like any other, getting punched; shoot at; throw at a river of snakes, by every passing minute, but always getting out of the situations full of scars and bleeding. And Indi is a character that make's humor and jokes of the situations that he is presented (not like Lando who delivers badass phrases by every minute). The script (considered one of the best ever written for a film) is excellent, but in technical aspects the movie is marvelous. Spielberg's direction nor comments, delivering chase sequences and action scenes that are breathtaking and are extremely fun, and also feeling really realistic. Everything bathed with John William's unforgettable soundtrack that gets stuck in your head forever (and ever since only made Star Wars soundtracks and every single Spielberg movie). A unforgettable classic that began one of the best trilogies ever made and it will live forever, thanks to a marvelous direction of Spielberg; superb writing; unforgettable character with an amazing performance from Ford. The masterpiece that invented cinema's entertainment, but none entertainment movie of today hold a candle close to this beautiful blend of a serious story with James Bond style and "The Treasure of sierra Madre" quest all with great quality that show's Lucas and Spielberg minds working together is still today considered a adventure's masterpiece. 10/10

    Review #5 of "My Top Ten Favorite Movies" Reviews "Spielberg can never top this. Period." - Luke Y. Thompson, Dallas Observer Luke is right. This is the best Spielberg film as of yet. I don't believe he can top this. The movie's charm and adventure just captivate you and fully engage you in the movie. It works like clockwork. This film combines adventure, greed, power, love, Nazis, Harrison Ford at his best, and many other things to make the best adventure film ever made. All the actors seem to enjoy their roles, and I especially love Paul Freeman's crazy French archaeologist character, Belloq. There are many iconic scenes here; the boulder chase scene, the plane explosion, the U-boat scene, the "kidnapped Marion" scene, the "Indy-shoots-the-guy-with-the-sword" scene, and of course the melting faces scene. I could go on and on. You will like every moment of this movie, and will want more. Since you want more, you have 3 almost-as-good sequels to watch! HandHStudios Rating: 10/10

    Harrison Ford makes his first appearance as Indiana Jones in this exciting, highly entertaining globe-trotting adventure, which finds archaeologist and college professor Jones pursuing Nazis who are searching for the Ark of the Covenant, with which they hope to use its mystical powers to help them conquer the world in Pre-World War II[1936] days. Harrison Ford became a huge star in his own right(not just as Han Solo) and is highly appealing and capable, really making Indiana come to life in this fantastic story, helped by a fine cast featuring Karen Allen, John Rhys Davies, and Denholm Elliot. Steven Spielberg directs in a breathless and inspired way, and this film is great fun(just don't ponder its credibility too closely...)

    As a kid I liked very much the adventure movies and all of these staff. I liked movies that had action, adventure and suspense, "Raiders of the Lost Ark" has all of that and that's why I consider this movie as the definition of an adventure movie. Steven Spielberg creates an another masterpiece with Harrison Ford as starring. The subject of this great movie is the search of the Lost Arc. Harrison Ford plays as Indiana Jones who is an archaeologist and adventurer who is hired by the government of the U.S to find it before of the Nazi. This movie harmoniously combines adventure and action with love and comedy, it's a movie that you will want to see it again and again.

    To me this is just about PERFECT. Harrison Ford has never really been BETTER (and as everyone knows he was HAN SOLO for heaven's sake & DECKARD in 'Blade Runner') he was BORN TO PLAY INDIANA JONES!!! Karen Allen is a most WONDERFUL Damsel in distress (Very cute too) The rest of the ensemble cast is spot on. Direction from Mr Steven Spielberg is dramatic & highly INVENTIVE. The Nazi's (Boo Boo) are looking for the ARK of the Covenant & it's mighty SUPERNATURAL powers that come with it & this makes for a great fun roller-coaster ride. The SPECIAL EFFECTS & Big Set-Pieces are AMAZING...and they come thick & fast. Should they make a 5th INDY Film then let's just hope they go back to this & the 3rd film's (THE LAST CRUSADE) tone as they're the better of the four made so far (although TEMPLE of DOOM & THE CRYSTAL SKULL are both super fun too) RAIDERS is right up there as one of my Favourite movies of ALL-TIME & i'm sure will be entertaining people when i'm long gone!

    "Raiders of the Lost Ark", the beginning of the Indiana Jones saga, is truly a movie that has stood the test of time. Harrison Ford as Jones is the perfect choice for this role, and we see him in the jungles of South America, a college class room, Nepal, Egypt, and a secret Nazi controlled island. There is a fellow archaeologist Dr. Rene Belloq or Belloq played by Paul Freeman, who is Jones enemy. Belloq and Jones race to find the Ark of the Covenant. Belloq enlist the help of the Nazis. Jones enlists the help of Marion Ravenwood played by Karen Allen, who is an ex-girlfriend. Jones also enlist the help of a friend Sallah played by John Rhys-Davies. Belloq and the Nazis plan to use the Ark for evil and world domination. Jones, Marion, And Sallah are out to stop Belloq and the Nazis. The theme of "Raiders of the Lost Ark" is good vs. evil. Jones, Marion, and Sallah play the role of the good guys while Belloq and the Nazis are the bad guys. Bellog role as evil or bad guy is reinforced by his willingness to stop at nothing to get what he wants, the statue, the ark, and Marion. Once the mention of the Nazi army and Hitler are mentioned we know they are the bad guys. This is based symbolism Nazis and Hitler. These words automatically invoke the thought of evil. Belloq and the Nazis are searching for the ark to use its power to rule the world. There is a line in the movie "No army that carried the ark has ever been defeated in battle." (Spielberg, 1981) "Raiders of the Lost Ark" uses sound to enhance the theme and settings. During action scenes in the movie when Jones is about to do something exceptional we here the same musical score. This score has become symbolic away from the movie and has been used in many situations in TV and film to stir fond memories. . .

At that time, people never had seen a hero that is a human like any other, getting punched; shoot at; throw at a river of snakes, by every passing minute, but always getting out of the situations full of scars and bleeding. And Indi is a character that make's humor and jokes of the situations that he is presented (not like Lando who delivers badass phrases by every minute). The script (considered one of the best ever written for a film) is excellent, but in technical aspects the movie is marvelous. Spielberg's direction nor comments, delivering chase sequences and action scenes that are breathtaking and are extremely fun, and also feeling really realistic. Everything bathed with John William's unforgettable soundtrack that gets stuck in your head forever (and ever since only made Star Wars soundtracks and every single Spielberg movie). A unforgettable classic that began one of the best trilogies ever made and it will live forever, thanks to a marvelous direction of Spielberg; superb writing; unforgettable character with an amazing performance from Ford. The masterpiece that invented cinema's entertainment, but none entertainment movie of today hold a candle close to this beautiful blend of a serious story with James Bond style and "The Treasure of sierra Madre" quest all with great quality that show's Lucas and Spielberg minds working together is still today considered a adventure's masterpiece. 10/10

    Review #5 of "My Top Ten Favorite Movies" Reviews "Spielberg can never top this. Period." - Luke Y. Thompson, Dallas Observer Luke is right. This is the best Spielberg film as of yet. I don't believe he can top this. The movie's charm and adventure just captivate you and fully engage you in the movie. It works like clockwork. This film combines adventure, greed, power, love, Nazis, Harrison Ford at his best, and many other things to make the best adventure film ever made. All the actors seem to enjoy their roles, and I especially love Paul Freeman's crazy French archaeologist character, Belloq. There are many iconic scenes here; the boulder chase scene, the plane explosion, the U-boat scene, the "kidnapped Marion" scene, the "Indy-shoots-the-guy-with-the-sword" scene, and of course the melting faces scene. I could go on and on. You will like every moment of this movie, and will want more. Since you want more, you have 3 almost-as-good sequels to watch! HandHStudios Rating: 10/10

    Harrison Ford makes his first appearance as Indiana Jones in this exciting, highly entertaining globe-trotting adventure, which finds archaeologist and college professor Jones pursuing Nazis who are searching for the Ark of the Covenant, with which they hope to use its mystical powers to help them conquer the world in Pre-World War II[1936] days. Harrison Ford became a huge star in his own right(not just as Han Solo) and is highly appealing and capable, really making Indiana come to life in this fantastic story, helped by a fine cast featuring Karen Allen, John Rhys Davies, and Denholm Elliot. Steven Spielberg directs in a breathless and inspired way, and this film is great fun(just don't ponder its credibility too closely...)

    As a kid I liked very much the adventure movies and all of these staff. I liked movies that had action, adventure and suspense, "Raiders of the Lost Ark" has all of that and that's why I consider this movie as the definition of an adventure movie. Steven Spielberg creates an another masterpiece with Harrison Ford as starring. The subject of this great movie is the search of the Lost Arc. Harrison Ford plays as Indiana Jones who is an archaeologist and adventurer who is hired by the government of the U.S to find it before of the Nazi. This movie harmoniously combines adventure and action with love and comedy, it's a movie that you will want to see it again and again.

    To me this is just about PERFECT. Harrison Ford has never really been BETTER (and as everyone knows he was HAN SOLO for heaven's sake & DECKARD in 'Blade Runner') he was BORN TO PLAY INDIANA JONES!!! Karen Allen is a most WONDERFUL Damsel in distress (Very cute too) The rest of the ensemble cast is spot on. Direction from Mr Steven Spielberg is dramatic & highly INVENTIVE. The Nazi's (Boo Boo) are looking for the ARK of the Covenant & it's mighty SUPERNATURAL powers that come with it & this makes for a great fun roller-coaster ride. The SPECIAL EFFECTS & Big Set-Pieces are AMAZING...and they come thick & fast. Should they make a 5th INDY Film then let's just hope they go back to this & the 3rd film's (THE LAST CRUSADE) tone as they're the better of the four made so far (although TEMPLE of DOOM & THE CRYSTAL SKULL are both super fun too) RAIDERS is right up there as one of my Favourite movies of ALL-TIME & i'm sure will be entertaining people when i'm long gone!

    "Raiders of the Lost Ark", the beginning of the Indiana Jones saga, is truly a movie that has stood the test of time. Harrison Ford as Jones is the perfect choice for this role, and we see him in the jungles of South America, a college class room, Nepal, Egypt, and a secret Nazi controlled island. There is a fellow archaeologist Dr. Rene Belloq or Belloq played by Paul Freeman, who is Jones enemy. Belloq and Jones race to find the Ark of the Covenant. Belloq enlist the help of the Nazis. Jones enlists the help of Marion Ravenwood played by Karen Allen, who is an ex-girlfriend. Jones also enlist the help of a friend Sallah played by John Rhys-Davies. Belloq and the Nazis plan to use the Ark for evil and world domination. Jones, Marion, And Sallah are out to stop Belloq and the Nazis. The theme of "Raiders of the Lost Ark" is good vs. evil. Jones, Marion, and Sallah play the role of the good guys while Belloq and the Nazis are the bad guys. Bellog role as evil or bad guy is reinforced by his willingness to stop at nothing to get what he wants, the statue, the ark, and Marion. Once the mention of the Nazi army and Hitler are mentioned we know they are the bad guys. This is based symbolism Nazis and Hitler. These words automatically invoke the thought of evil. Belloq and the Nazis are searching for the ark to use its power to rule the world. There is a line in the movie "No army that carried the ark has ever been defeated in battle." (Spielberg, 1981) "Raiders of the Lost Ark" uses sound to enhance the theme and settings. During action scenes in the movie when Jones is about to do something exceptional we here the same musical score. This score has become symbolic away from the movie and has been used in many situations in TV and film to stir fond memories. . .

    Being one of the first true adventure films to come out in years, Raiders of the Lost Ark is able to not only redefine the action genre as a whole, but be so well made that no film since it's release has been able to top it. When they stated on the poster that this movie was the return of the great adventure, they weren't kidding. What a lot of people aren't aware of is that Steven Spielberg and George Lucas created the Indiana Jones movies as a tribute to the classic adventure films and old film serials that came out during the Great Depression and World War II. Such films that were payed tribute to (or ripped off) were "Secret of the Incas", "The Treasure of Sierra Madre", "China", and "Gunga Din". In that regard, it not only does that job, but delivers a timeless movie. I could pop this movie in any day and enjoy it. It never gets old. These movies are about treasure hunting, exotic locations, and great action set pieces. Everything flows perfectly from scene to scene. There's just a perfect balance of drama, humor, action, and romance. It works on every level-- If you're able to let back and not be critical, this is a great experience that will take you back to the past. It's well worth your time and once you see it, you won't get enough of it. PS: Check out those other classic movies. They're fun to watch too.

    This movie is a 1930's adventure, nothing more. It does not hold deep meaning, or fascinating characters, or moral lessons. It's like the epic adventures you see in the old Disney comics. It's what Spielberg made before he developed the desire to make "meaningful" movies such as "The Color Purple" or "Schindler's List", with mixed success. So what is the story? Indiana Jones is shown trying to retrieve an idol in some remote forest peopled by savage natives, and fails. Then it shows him as a college professor teaching a class. Then he is hired to find the Ark Of The Covenant before Hitler does, and he travels to Nepal to find a woman who holds a medallion which holds the key to finding the Ark. Then she goes with him on a series of wild adventures. Basically the rest of the movie is a roller-coaster ride. There is little more realism than on the "A-Team" TV show (an example is where Indy is dragged under a speeding truck and yet uninjured). Yet it is an entertaining ride, fast-paced and something you like seeing repeatedly, as I did.

    The team up of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas sounded extraordinary during the late 70s and early 80s. The director of Jaws and Close Encounters of the Third Kind and the man who brought us Star Wars respectively were two of the biggest filmmakers in that era and the decision for them to collaborate on a motion picture was sure to gain high expectations. With Raiders of the Lost Ark, the first entry in the much lauded Indiana Jones saga, Spielberg and Lucas made a film that was reminiscent of the old action movie serials from the 1940s, just like how Star Wars was born out of Flash Gordon serials. Raiders revamped the old-fashioned approach of the genre, with a likable main character, a compelling romance, fun action, a witty screenplay and a rousing story. This remains one of Spielberg's most masterful directorial efforts and one of my favourite movies. After failing to retrieve a priceless artifact from a temple in the Amazon rainforest, archaeologist and teacher Indiana Jones and his colleague and friend Marcus are approached by two Army intelligence agents who inform them that the Nazis have become obsessed with obtaining occult power and are looking for Indy's former mentor Abner Ravenwood who lead an expedition to find the lost Egyptian city of Tanis and possesses the headpiece of the Staff of Ra. Indy then deduces that the Nazis are searching for Tanis in search of the fabled Ark of the Covenant; the chest created by the Hebrews that stored the fragments of the Ten Commandments. The Nazis believe that if they acquired it then their army would be invincible. The Staff of Ra is needed to unlock the Well of Souls where the Ark is hidden. Indy is assigned to reach the Ark before the Nazis do and travels to Nepal to talk to Abner's daughter Marion, who is also Indy's former lover. Indy learns from Marion that Abner died and that she has the headpiece to the Staff on her. When Nazi agents follow Indy to Marion's tavern, they wreak havoc and the tavern gets burned down. Marion agrees to accompany Indy to Egypt to help him find the Ark where they meet Indy's good friend Sallah and discover that Indy's rival, Rene Belloq, is involved in the Nazi digging operation outside of Cairo to locate the Well of Souls. Raiders of the Lost Ark is largely constructed out of the style of the old 40s movie serials. Indy always gets into a life-threatening situation but comes out relatively unscathed. Every moments that occurs is played out like a cliffhanger to a serial. However, despite the homages to those old-fashioned adventure tales, Spielberg and Lucas don't forget that the film needs an understanding of character to keep the viewer interested. I believe that Harrison Ford is about 80% responsible for making the character of Indy such a beloved hero. A departure from his more cynical and self-reliant Han Solo in Star Wars, Ford plays Indy as a no-nonsense hero who is also benevolent and caring to the people close to him. This particularly shows in his relationship with Marion. Despite their rocky start, the two begin to appreciate each other's company and their love for each other begins to spark again. In one scene where Indy believe Marion is dead, he is traumatized and guilt-ridden. Ford's charismatic light-hearted performance and the character's personality made him into an action movie icon. Karen Allen delivers a strong female opposite to Indy as Marion. Unlike most female leads in the old adventure films, she's actually a strong- willed character who pulls a few punches (her first scene punching Indy being a prime example). She is perhaps the best leading woman in the series and her absence in Temple of Doom and Last Crusade was one reason why they were marginally less impressive than this film. Paul Freeman as Belloq is a villain who seeks the Ark as a means for his own personal gain. Unlike the Nazis, all he requires is a simple payment and a case of recognition. He pulls off the charm well and isn't simply a megalomaniac with who seeks power. John-Rhys Davies as Sallah was what gained him a cult following before playing Gimli in Lord of the Rings. His performance as the good-natured friend to Indy provides some of the light-hearted moments in the film. John Williams, who composed the scores to Spielberg's previous successful features along with Lucas' Star Wars, crafted the score to this film. The upbeat and marching theme tune has become one of the mos iconic film scores of the past half century and is perhaps Williams' best known music behind Star Wars. Some of the film's finest moments also have become iconic moments in film history. The ad-libbed scene where Indy is confronted by a swordsman in Cairo and instead of confronting him in a duel, non-chalantly picks out his revolver and shoots him. The climactic scene of the Ark opening is one of the finest moments of gore in film and an awesome way to wrap up the story. Raiders of the Lost Ark is a fine piece of movie making that represents the re-imagining of a genre as well as two great directors coming together to craft such a wonderful piece of cinema. Just like Star Wars, Raiders paved the way for sequels that, whilst not as impressive, were still entertaining and fun adventure movies. Some intriguing supernatural elements along with some innovative visuals and action, a cynical and yet touching romance and most of all, an appealing leading man make this a tremendous experience and one film that I include on my all time favourites.

    I had a blast watching Raiders of the Lost Ark and it definitely has a lot of great aspects that make it such a beloved adventure film. There is a fair amount of genuinely funny scenes and some excellent thrills. John Williams' score is memorable as always and the action sequences were handled very well. Harrison Ford is terrific as Indiana Jones and just transmits a sense of coolness, always having a strong screen presence. I thought the other actors were pretty good and gave convincing performances, but Ford is definitely the one who really stands out here. Raiders of the Lost Ark is a great action flick, having plenty of suspenseful, comical, iconic moments and it's not to be missed.

    Professor Indiana Jones was introduced to the world here, and thanks to the genius of George Lucas and the fantastic direction of the legendary Steven Spielberg, it will be remembered forever. "Raiders of the Lost Ark" was the masterpiece who not only launched the legendary saga of adventure and the fantastic history of the unforgettable Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford), but also invented the cinema's entertainment, all thanks to a revolutionized and classic story! Early on we see this man who seems to be a cowboy (cowboy hat, a revolver, a whip, daah). We see him and a small group of Latinos venturing in the jungles of South America, soon the audience knows that he is searching for an ancient treasure entering into a cave. There he is faced with several decaying corpses and discovers that the whole room is full of traps. After getting out the golden statue of his precious place, he burst out run and we received the classic chase scene of a huge round stone. After our hero get-away, but he just falls into another deadly trap by a competitor. Our hero escapes again, and later we discoveres that the movie story takes place on the year of 1936, before the second Great War, and our hero is called Indiana Jones and he is a professor and archaeologist who works for a museum. Then, Jones learns about a biblical artifact called "The Ark of the Covenant" from the healer of the museum and also discovers that this artifact might hold the key to human existence and the powers of god. Now Jones embarks on this adventure to great places ranging from the mountains of Nepal to the deserts of Egypt with the help of his former lover Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen). However, he will have to fight against his competitor Renee Belloq (Paul Freeman) and an army of Nazis in order to reach it. The whole story since the very beginning became a classic thanks to Lawrence Kasdan's writing improving by every minute of the film, delivering great dialog explanations of the historical artifacts in the film are very realistic and very simple, leaving the viewer feeling pretty smart. Not only with artifacts explanations that the scripts stands out, but delivers us several humoristic moments with a really smart and fun humor, full of cultural references of the time of the story. But not only humor that makes and revolutionize the movie, but is the change of tone, giving really dark and serious moments to Indi's journey across the globe. Speaking of Indi again, that is another character made by Lucas and starring Harrison Ford that sticks in our minds forever. While in the "Star Wars" trilogy we have the funny and unforgettable Lando, here like I said before we have professor Indiana Jones badass, smart and once again unforgettable. Both of then became legendary, but Indi is the one that we never had seen before, and till today makes you think. At that time, people never had seen a hero that is a human like any other, getting punched; shoot at; throw at a river of snakes, by every passing minute, but always getting out of the situations full of scars and bleeding. And Indi is a character that make's humor and jokes of the situations that he is presented (not like Lando who delivers badass phrases by every minute). The script (considered one of the best ever written for a film) is excellent, but in technical aspects the movie is marvelous. Spielberg's direction nor comments, delivering chase sequences and action scenes that are breathtaking and are extremely fun, and also feeling really realistic. Everything bathed with John William's unforgettable soundtrack that gets stuck in your head forever (and ever since only made Star Wars soundtracks and every single Spielberg movie). A unforgettable classic that began one of the best trilogies ever made and it will live forever, thanks to a marvelous direction of Spielberg; superb writing; unforgettable character with an amazing performance from Ford. The masterpiece that invented cinema's entertainment, but none entertainment movie of today hold a candle close to this beautiful blend of a serious story with James Bond style and "The Treasure of sierra Madre" quest all with great quality that show's Lucas and Spielberg minds working together is still today considered a adventure's masterpiece. 10/10

    The team up of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas sounded extraordinary during the late 70s and early 80s. The director of Jaws and Close Encounters of the Third Kind and the man who brought us Star Wars respectively were two of the biggest filmmakers in that era and the decision for them to collaborate on a motion picture was sure to gain high expectations. With Raiders of the Lost Ark, the first entry in the much lauded Indiana Jones saga, Spielberg and Lucas made a film that was reminiscent of the old action movie serials from the 1940s, just like how Star Wars was born out of Flash Gordon serials. Raiders revamped the old-fashioned approach of the genre, with a likable main character, a compelling romance, fun action, a witty screenplay and a rousing story. This remains one of Spielberg's most masterful directorial efforts and one of my favourite movies. After failing to retrieve a priceless artifact from a temple in the Amazon rainforest, archaeologist and teacher Indiana Jones and his colleague and friend Marcus are approached by two Army intelligence agents who inform them that the Nazis have become obsessed with obtaining occult power and are looking for Indy's former mentor Abner Ravenwood who lead an expedition to find the lost Egyptian city of Tanis and possesses the headpiece of the Staff of Ra. Indy then deduces that the Nazis are searching for Tanis in search of the fabled Ark of the Covenant; the chest created by the Hebrews that stored the fragments of the Ten Commandments. The Nazis believe that if they acquired it then their army would be invincible. The Staff of Ra is needed to unlock the Well of Souls where the Ark is hidden. Indy is assigned to reach the Ark before the Nazis do and travels to Nepal to talk to Abner's daughter Marion, who is also Indy's former lover. Indy learns from Marion that Abner died and that she has the headpiece to the Staff on her. When Nazi agents follow Indy to Marion's tavern, they wreak havoc and the tavern gets burned down. Marion agrees to accompany Indy to Egypt to help him find the Ark where they meet Indy's good friend Sallah and discover that Indy's rival, Rene Belloq, is involved in the Nazi digging operation outside of Cairo to locate the Well of Souls. Raiders of the Lost Ark is largely constructed out of the style of the old 40s movie serials. Indy always gets into a life-threatening situation but comes out relatively unscathed. Every moments that occurs is played out like a cliffhanger to a serial. However, despite the homages to those old-fashioned adventure tales, Spielberg and Lucas don't forget that the film needs an understanding of character to keep the viewer interested. I believe that Harrison Ford is about 80% responsible for making the character of Indy such a beloved hero. A departure from his more cynical and self-reliant Han Solo in Star Wars, Ford plays Indy as a no-nonsense hero who is also benevolent and caring to the people close to him. This particularly shows in his relationship with Marion. Despite their rocky start, the two begin to appreciate each other's company and their love for each other begins to spark again. In one scene where Indy believe Marion is dead, he is traumatized and guilt-ridden. Ford's charismatic light-hearted performance and the character's personality made him into an action movie icon. Karen Allen delivers a strong female opposite to Indy as Marion. Unlike most female leads in the old adventure films, she's actually a strong- willed character who pulls a few punches (her first scene punching Indy being a prime example). She is perhaps the best leading woman in the series and her absence in Temple of Doom and Last Crusade was one reason why they were marginally less impressive than this film. Paul Freeman as Belloq is a villain who seeks the Ark as a means for his own personal gain. Unlike the Nazis, all he requires is a simple payment and a case of recognition. He pulls off the charm well and isn't simply a megalomaniac with who seeks power. John-Rhys Davies as Sallah was what gained him a cult following before playing Gimli in Lord of the Rings. His performance as the good-natured friend to Indy provides some of the light-hearted moments in the film. John Williams, who composed the scores to Spielberg's previous successful features along with Lucas' Star Wars, crafted the score to this film. The upbeat and marching theme tune has become one of the mos iconic film scores of the past half century and is perhaps Williams' best known music behind Star Wars. Some of the film's finest moments also have become iconic moments in film history. The ad-libbed scene where Indy is confronted by a swordsman in Cairo and instead of confronting him in a duel, non-chalantly picks out his revolver and shoots him. The climactic scene of the Ark opening is one of the finest moments of gore in film and an awesome way to wrap up the story. Raiders of the Lost Ark is a fine piece of movie making that represents the re-imagining of a genre as well as two great directors coming together to craft such a wonderful piece of cinema. Just like Star Wars, Raiders paved the way for sequels that, whilst not as impressive, were still entertaining and fun adventure movies. Some intriguing supernatural elements along with some innovative visuals and action, a cynical and yet touching romance and most of all, an appealing leading man make this a tremendous experience and one film that I include on my all time favourites.

    I had a blast watching Raiders of the Lost Ark and it definitely has a lot of great aspects that make it such a beloved adventure film. There is a fair amount of genuinely funny scenes and some excellent thrills. John Williams' score is memorable as always and the action sequences were handled very well. Harrison Ford is terrific as Indiana Jones and just transmits a sense of coolness, always having a strong screen presence. I thought the other actors were pretty good and gave convincing performances, but Ford is definitely the one who really stands out here. Raiders of the Lost Ark is a great action flick, having plenty of suspenseful, comical, iconic moments and it's not to be missed.

    Professor Indiana Jones was introduced to the world here, and thanks to the genius of George Lucas and the fantastic direction of the legendary Steven Spielberg, it will be remembered forever. "Raiders of the Lost Ark" was the masterpiece who not only launched the legendary saga of adventure and the fantastic history of the unforgettable Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford), but also invented the cinema's entertainment, all thanks to a revolutionized and classic story! Early on we see this man who seems to be a cowboy (cowboy hat, a revolver, a whip, daah). We see him and a small group of Latinos venturing in the jungles of South America, soon the audience knows that he is searching for an ancient treasure entering into a cave. There he is faced with several decaying corpses and discovers that the whole room is full of traps. After getting out the golden statue of his precious place, he burst out run and we received the classic chase scene of a huge round stone. After our hero get-away, but he just falls into another deadly trap by a competitor. Our hero escapes again, and later we discoveres that the movie story takes place on the year of 1936, before the second Great War, and our hero is called Indiana Jones and he is a professor and archaeologist who works for a museum. Then, Jones learns about a biblical artifact called "The Ark of the Covenant" from the healer of the museum and also discovers that this artifact might hold the key to human existence and the powers of god. Now Jones embarks on this adventure to great places ranging from the mountains of Nepal to the deserts of Egypt with the help of his former lover Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen). However, he will have to fight against his competitor Renee Belloq (Paul Freeman) and an army of Nazis in order to reach it. The whole story since the very beginning became a classic thanks to Lawrence Kasdan's writing improving by every minute of the film, delivering great dialog explanations of the historical artifacts in the film are very realistic and very simple, leaving the viewer feeling pretty smart. Not only with artifacts explanations that the scripts stands out, but delivers us several humoristic moments with a really smart and fun humor, full of cultural references of the time of the story. But not only humor that makes and revolutionize the movie, but is the change of tone, giving really dark and serious moments to Indi's journey across the globe. Speaking of Indi again, that is another character made by Lucas and starring Harrison Ford that sticks in our minds forever. While in the "Star Wars" trilogy we have the funny and unforgettable Lando, here like I said before we have professor Indiana Jones badass, smart and once again unforgettable. Both of then became legendary, but Indi is the one that we never had seen before, and till today makes you think. At that time, people never had seen a hero that is a human like any other, getting punched; shoot at; throw at a river of snakes, by every passing minute, but always getting out of the situations full of scars and bleeding. And Indi is a character that make's humor and jokes of the situations that he is presented (not like Lando who delivers badass phrases by every minute). The script (considered one of the best ever written for a film) is excellent, but in technical aspects the movie is marvelous. Spielberg's direction nor comments, delivering chase sequences and action scenes that are breathtaking and are extremely fun, and also feeling really realistic. Everything bathed with John William's unforgettable soundtrack that gets stuck in your head forever (and ever since only made Star Wars soundtracks and every single Spielberg movie). A unforgettable classic that began one of the best trilogies ever made and it will live forever, thanks to a marvelous direction of Spielberg; superb writing; unforgettable character with an amazing performance from Ford. The masterpiece that invented cinema's entertainment, but none entertainment movie of today hold a candle close to this beautiful blend of a serious story with James Bond style and "The Treasure of sierra Madre" quest all with great quality that show's Lucas and Spielberg minds working together is still today considered a adventure's masterpiece. 10/10

    Review #5 of "My Top Ten Favorite Movies" Reviews "Spielberg can never top this. Period." - Luke Y. Thompson, Dallas Observer Luke is right. This is the best Spielberg film as of yet. I don't believe he can top this. The movie's charm and adventure just captivate you and fully engage you in the movie. It works like clockwork. This film combines adventure, greed, power, love, Nazis, Harrison Ford at his best, and many other things to make the best adventure film ever made. All the actors seem to enjoy their roles, and I especially love Paul Freeman's crazy French archaeologist character, Belloq. There are many iconic scenes here; the boulder chase scene, the plane explosion, the U-boat scene, the "kidnapped Marion" scene, the "Indy-shoots-the-guy-with-the-sword" scene, and of course the melting faces scene. I could go on and on. You will like every moment of this movie, and will want more. Since you want more, you have 3 almost-as-good sequels to watch! HandHStudios Rating: 10/10

    Harrison Ford makes his first appearance as Indiana Jones in this exciting, highly entertaining globe-trotting adventure, which finds archaeologist and college professor Jones pursuing Nazis who are searching for the Ark of the Covenant, with which they hope to use its mystical powers to help them conquer the world in Pre-World War II[1936] days. Harrison Ford became a huge star in his own right(not just as Han Solo) and is highly appealing and capable, really making Indiana come to life in this fantastic story, helped by a fine cast featuring Karen Allen, John Rhys Davies, and Denholm Elliot. Steven Spielberg directs in a breathless and inspired way, and this film is great fun(just don't ponder its credibility too closely...)

    As a kid I liked very much the adventure movies and all of these staff. I liked movies that had action, adventure and suspense, "Raiders of the Lost Ark" has all of that and that's why I consider this movie as the definition of an adventure movie. Steven Spielberg creates an another masterpiece with Harrison Ford as starring. The subject of this great movie is the search of the Lost Arc. Harrison Ford plays as Indiana Jones who is an archaeologist and adventurer who is hired by the government of the U.S to find it before of the Nazi. This movie harmoniously combines adventure and action with love and comedy, it's a movie that you will want to see it again and again.

    To me this is just about PERFECT. Harrison Ford has never really been BETTER (and as everyone knows he was HAN SOLO for heaven's sake & DECKARD in 'Blade Runner') he was BORN TO PLAY INDIANA JONES!!! Karen Allen is a most WONDERFUL Damsel in distress (Very cute too) The rest of the ensemble cast is spot on. Direction from Mr Steven Spielberg is dramatic & highly INVENTIVE. The Nazi's (Boo Boo) are looking for the ARK of the Covenant & it's mighty SUPERNATURAL powers that come with it & this makes for a great fun roller-coaster ride. The SPECIAL EFFECTS & Big Set-Pieces are AMAZING...and they come thick & fast. Should they make a 5th INDY Film then let's just hope they go back to this & the 3rd film's (THE LAST CRUSADE) tone as they're the better of the four made so far (although TEMPLE of DOOM & THE CRYSTAL SKULL are both super fun too) RAIDERS is right up there as one of my Favourite movies of ALL-TIME & i'm sure will be entertaining people when i'm long gone!

    "Raiders of the Lost Ark", the beginning of the Indiana Jones saga, is truly a movie that has stood the test of time. Harrison Ford as Jones is the perfect choice for this role, and we see him in the jungles of South America, a college class room, Nepal, Egypt, and a secret Nazi controlled island. There is a fellow archaeologist Dr. Rene Belloq or Belloq played by Paul Freeman, who is Jones enemy. Belloq and Jones race to find the Ark of the Covenant. Belloq enlist the help of the Nazis. Jones enlists the help of Marion Ravenwood played by Karen Allen, who is an ex-girlfriend. Jones also enlist the help of a friend Sallah played by John Rhys-Davies. Belloq and the Nazis plan to use the Ark for evil and world domination. Jones, Marion, And Sallah are out to stop Belloq and the Nazis. The theme of "Raiders of the Lost Ark" is good vs. evil. Jones, Marion, and Sallah play the role of the good guys while Belloq and the Nazis are the bad guys. Bellog role as evil or bad guy is reinforced by his willingness to stop at nothing to get what he wants, the statue, the ark, and Marion. Once the mention of the Nazi army and Hitler are mentioned we know they are the bad guys. This is based symbolism Nazis and Hitler. These words automatically invoke the thought of evil. Belloq and the Nazis are searching for the ark to use its power to rule the world. There is a line in the movie "No army that carried the ark has ever been defeated in battle." (Spielberg, 1981) "Raiders of the Lost Ark" uses sound to enhance the theme and settings. During action scenes in the movie when Jones is about to do something exceptional we here the same musical score. This score has become symbolic away from the movie and has been used in many situations in TV and film to stir fond memories. . .

    Being one of the first true adventure films to come out in years, Raiders of the Lost Ark is able to not only redefine the action genre as a whole, but be so well made that no film since it's release has been able to top it. When they stated on the poster that this movie was the return of the great adventure, they weren't kidding. What a lot of people aren't aware of is that Steven Spielberg and George Lucas created the Indiana Jones movies as a tribute to the classic adventure films and old film serials that came out during the Great Depression and World War II. Such films that were payed tribute to (or ripped off) were "Secret of the Incas", "The Treasure of Sierra Madre", "China", and "Gunga Din". In that regard, it not only does that job, but delivers a timeless movie. I could pop this movie in any day and enjoy it. It never gets old. These movies are about treasure hunting, exotic locations, and great action set pieces. Everything flows perfectly from scene to scene. There's just a perfect balance of drama, humor, action, and romance. It works on every level-- If you're able to let back and not be critical, this is a great experience that will take you back to the past. It's well worth your time and once you see it, you won't get enough of it. PS: Check out those other classic movies. They're fun to watch too.

    This movie is a 1930's adventure, nothing more. It does not hold deep meaning, or fascinating characters, or moral lessons. It's like the epic adventures you see in the old Disney comics. It's what Spielberg made before he developed the desire to make "meaningful" movies such as "The Color Purple" or "Schindler's List", with mixed success. So what is the story? Indiana Jones is shown trying to retrieve an idol in some remote forest peopled by savage natives, and fails. Then it shows him as a college professor teaching a class. Then he is hired to find the Ark Of The Covenant before Hitler does, and he travels to Nepal to find a woman who holds a medallion which holds the key to finding the Ark. Then she goes with him on a series of wild adventures. Basically the rest of the movie is a roller-coaster ride. There is little more realism than on the "A-Team" TV show (an example is where Indy is dragged under a speeding truck and yet uninjured). Yet it is an entertaining ride, fast-paced and something you like seeing repeatedly, as I did.

    Harrison Ford makes his first appearance as Indiana Jones in this exciting, highly entertaining globe-trotting adventure, which finds archaeologist and college professor Jones pursuing Nazis who are searching for the Ark of the Covenant, with which they hope to use its mystical powers to help them conquer the world in Pre-World War II[1936] days. Harrison Ford became a huge star in his own right(not just as Han Solo) and is highly appealing and capable, really making Indiana come to life in this fantastic story, helped by a fine cast featuring Karen Allen, John Rhys Davies, and Denholm Elliot. Steven Spielberg directs in a breathless and inspired way, and this film is great fun(just don't ponder its credibility too closely...)

    As a kid I liked very much the adventure movies and all of these staff. I liked movies that had action, adventure and suspense, "Raiders of the Lost Ark" has all of that and that's why I consider this movie as the definition of an adventure movie. Steven Spielberg creates an another masterpiece with Harrison Ford as starring. The subject of this great movie is the search of the Lost Arc. Harrison Ford plays as Indiana Jones who is an archaeologist and adventurer who is hired by the government of the U.S to find it before of the Nazi. This movie harmoniously combines adventure and action with love and comedy, it's a movie that you will want to see it again and again.

    To me this is just about PERFECT. Harrison Ford has never really been BETTER (and as everyone knows he was HAN SOLO for heaven's sake & DECKARD in 'Blade Runner') he was BORN TO PLAY INDIANA JONES!!! Karen Allen is a most WONDERFUL Damsel in distress (Very cute too) The rest of the ensemble cast is spot on. Direction from Mr Steven Spielberg is dramatic & highly INVENTIVE. The Nazi's (Boo Boo) are looking for the ARK of the Covenant & it's mighty SUPERNATURAL powers that come with it & this makes for a great fun roller-coaster ride. The SPECIAL EFFECTS & Big Set-Pieces are AMAZING...and they come thick & fast. Should they make a 5th INDY Film then let's just hope they go back to this & the 3rd film's (THE LAST CRUSADE) tone as they're the better of the four made so far (although TEMPLE of DOOM & THE CRYSTAL SKULL are both super fun too) RAIDERS is right up there as one of my Favourite movies of ALL-TIME & i'm sure will be entertaining people when i'm long gone! A Rocketeer Flyer...Up Up & Away 10/10

    "Raiders of the Lost Ark", the beginning of the Indiana Jones saga, is truly a movie that has stood the test of time. Harrison Ford as Jones is the perfect choice for this role, and we see him in the jungles of South America, a college class room, Nepal, Egypt, and a secret Nazi controlled island. There is a fellow archaeologist Dr. Rene Belloq or Belloq played by Paul Freeman, who is Jones enemy. Belloq and Jones race to find the Ark of the Covenant. Belloq enlist the help of the Nazis. Jones enlists the help of Marion Ravenwood played by Karen Allen, who is an ex-girlfriend. Jones also enlist the help of a friend Sallah played by John Rhys-Davies. Belloq and the Nazis plan to use the Ark for evil and world domination. Jones, Marion, And Sallah are out to stop Belloq and the Nazis. The theme of "Raiders of the Lost Ark" is good vs. evil. Jones, Marion, and Sallah play the role of the good guys while Belloq and the Nazis are the bad guys. Bellog role as evil or bad guy is reinforced by his willingness to stop at nothing to get what he wants, the statue, the ark, and Marion. Once the mention of the Nazi army and Hitler are mentioned we know they are the bad guys. This is based symbolism Nazis and Hitler. These words automatically invoke the thought of evil. Belloq and the Nazis are searching for the ark to use its power to rule the world. There is a line in the movie "No army that carried the ark has ever been defeated in battle." (Spielberg, 1981) "Raiders of the Lost Ark" uses sound to enhance the theme and settings. During action scenes in the movie when Jones is about to do something exceptional we here the same musical score. This score has become symbolic away from the movie and has been used in many situations in TV and film to stir fond memories. . .

    Being one of the first true adventure films to come out in years, Raiders of the Lost Ark is able to not only redefine the action genre as a whole, but be so well made that no film since it's release has been able to top it. When they stated on the poster that this movie was the return of the great adventure, they weren't kidding. What a lot of people aren't aware of is that Steven Spielberg and George Lucas created the Indiana Jones movies as a tribute to the classic adventure films and old film serials that came out during the Great Depression and World War II. Such films that were payed tribute to (or ripped off) were "Secret of the Incas", "The Treasure of Sierra Madre", "China", and "Gunga Din". In that regard, it not only does that job, but delivers a timeless movie. I could pop this movie in any day and enjoy it. It never gets old. These movies are about treasure hunting, exotic locations, and great action set pieces. Everything flows perfectly from scene to scene. There's just a perfect balance of drama, humor, action, and romance. It works on every level-- If you're able to let back and not be critical, this is a great experience that will take you back to the past. It's well worth your time and once you see it, you won't get enough of it. PS: Check out those other classic movies. They're fun to watch too.

    This movie is a 1930's adventure, nothing more. It does not hold deep meaning, or fascinating characters, or moral lessons. It's like the epic adventures you see in the old Disney comics. It's what Spielberg made before he developed the desire to make "meaningful" movies such as "The Color Purple" or "Schindler's List", with mixed success. So what is the story? Indiana Jones is shown trying to retrieve an idol in some remote forest peopled by savage natives, and fails. Then it shows him as a college professor teaching a class. Then he is hired to find the Ark Of The Covenant before Hitler does, and he travels to Nepal to find a woman who holds a medallion which holds the key to finding the Ark. Then she goes with him on a series of wild adventures. Basically the rest of the movie is a roller-coaster ride. There is little more realism than on the "A-Team" TV show (an example is where Indy is dragged under a speeding truck and yet uninjured). Yet it is an entertaining ride, fast-paced and something you like seeing repeatedly, as I did.

    The team up of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas sounded extraordinary during the late 70s and early 80s. The director of Jaws and Close Encounters of the Third Kind and the man who brought us Star Wars respectively were two of the biggest filmmakers in that era and the decision for them to collaborate on a motion picture was sure to gain high expectations. With Raiders of the Lost Ark, the first entry in the much lauded Indiana Jones saga, Spielberg and Lucas made a film that was reminiscent of the old action movie serials from the 1940s, just like how Star Wars was born out of Flash Gordon serials. Raiders revamped the old-fashioned approach of the genre, with a likable main character, a compelling romance, fun action, a witty screenplay and a rousing story. This remains one of Spielberg's most masterful directorial efforts and one of my favourite movies. After failing to retrieve a priceless artifact from a temple in the Amazon rainforest, archaeologist and teacher Indiana Jones and his colleague and friend Marcus are approached by two Army intelligence agents who inform them that the Nazis have become obsessed with obtaining occult power and are looking for Indy's former mentor Abner Ravenwood who lead an expedition to find the lost Egyptian city of Tanis and possesses the headpiece of the Staff of Ra. Indy then deduces that the Nazis are searching for Tanis in search of the fabled Ark of the Covenant; the chest created by the Hebrews that stored the fragments of the Ten Commandments. The Nazis believe that if they acquired it then their army would be invincible. The Staff of Ra is needed to unlock the Well of Souls where the Ark is hidden. Indy is assigned to reach the Ark before the Nazis do and travels to Nepal to talk to Abner's daughter Marion, who is also Indy's former lover. Indy learns from Marion that Abner died and that she has the headpiece to the Staff on her. When Nazi agents follow Indy to Marion's tavern, they wreak havoc and the tavern gets burned down. Marion agrees to accompany Indy to Egypt to help him find the Ark where they meet Indy's good friend Sallah and discover that Indy's rival, Rene Belloq, is involved in the Nazi digging operation outside of Cairo to locate the Well of Souls. Raiders of the Lost Ark is largely constructed out of the style of the old 40s movie serials. Indy always gets into a life-threatening situation but comes out relatively unscathed. Every moments that occurs is played out like a cliffhanger to a serial. However, despite the homages to those old-fashioned adventure tales, Spielberg and Lucas don't forget that the film needs an understanding of character to keep the viewer interested. I believe that Harrison Ford is about 80% responsible for making the character of Indy such a beloved hero. A departure from his more cynical and self-reliant Han Solo in Star Wars, Ford plays Indy as a no-nonsense hero who is also benevolent and caring to the people close to him. This particularly shows in his relationship with Marion. Despite their rocky start, the two begin to appreciate each other's company and their love for each other begins to spark again. In one scene where Indy believe Marion is dead, he is traumatized and guilt-ridden. Ford's charismatic light-hearted performance and the character's personality made him into an action movie icon. Karen Allen delivers a strong female opposite to Indy as Marion. Unlike most female leads in the old adventure films, she's actually a strong- willed character who pulls a few punches (her first scene punching Indy being a prime example). She is perhaps the best leading woman in the series and her absence in Temple of Doom and Last Crusade was one reason why they were marginally less impressive than this film. Paul Freeman as Belloq is a villain who seeks the Ark as a means for his own personal gain. Unlike the Nazis, all he requires is a simple payment and a case of recognition. He pulls off the charm well and isn't simply a megalomaniac with who seeks power. John-Rhys Davies as Sallah was what gained him a cult following before playing Gimli in Lord of the Rings. His performance as the good-natured friend to Indy provides some of the light-hearted moments in the film. John Williams, who composed the scores to Spielberg's previous successful features along with Lucas' Star Wars, crafted the score to this film. The upbeat and marching theme tune has become one of the mos iconic film scores of the past half century and is perhaps Williams' best known music behind Star Wars. Some of the film's finest moments also have become iconic moments in film history. The ad-libbed scene where Indy is confronted by a swordsman in Cairo and instead of confronting him in a duel, non-chalantly picks out his revolver and shoots him. The climactic scene of the Ark opening is one of the finest moments of gore in film and an awesome way to wrap up the story. Raiders of the Lost Ark is a fine piece of movie making that represents the re-imagining of a genre as well as two great directors coming together to craft such a wonderful piece of cinema. Just like Star Wars, Raiders paved the way for sequels that, whilst not as impressive, were still entertaining and fun adventure movies. Some intriguing supernatural elements along with some innovative visuals and action, a cynical and yet touching romance and most of all, an appealing leading man make this a tremendous experience and one film that I include on my all time favourites.
