    The City of Lost Children is the follow up to French directors Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunet's popular and critical hit Delicatessen. It wasn't as successful as that earlier movie though. But despite not connecting with a wide audience it almost immediately became a cult movie. To date it is the last film that these two cinematic stylists have made together. To be honest, it isn't necessarily surprising that this one didn't do as well commercially as Delicatessen. Despite sharing a lot of visual ideas and having similar humour and general setting, the story by comparison is quite messy and not necessarily clear for a lot of first time viewers. The set-up is considerably more expansive than in Delicatessen though; where that one was almost exclusively based in a single tenement block, this one incorporates many locations  in the city, under the sea, on a converted oil rig  and this is really the chief strength of the film. The sets, props and costumes are all very well designed indeed. The look has that quite specific retro-future styling that Caro and Jeunet are so fond of. The detailed set-design, stylised gloomy colour scheme and controlled lighting really works well and creates an atmosphere and tone all of its own. It's the visual ideas that are definitely the real draw here. The story is somewhat less engaging. It's about an evil scientist called Krank who cannot dream. He kidnaps children in order to steal their dreams. He sends out his henchmen, the cyclops, to carry out this evil task. One day they steal the brother of a circus strongman called One who then, with the help of a little girl thief, sets out on a rescue mission. There's a few other things going on in the story but it's not especially brilliant and seems more like a means to an end; a framework that allows the directors to create their visual artistry. Having said that there are individual scenes that are well worked out such as the whole sequence down by the harbour. There are some interesting characters too such as the evil Siamese twins, known simply as The Octopus. Ron Perlman is good enough as One but better is the young performer Judith Vittet as the little thief Crumb, while Dominique Pinon is excellent in the role of the clones  he is so convincing you really do forget that it isn't four different actors on screen. For me this is not as successful as Delicatessen but it's certainly an extremely worthwhile film. It's a very interesting blend of sci-fi and fantasy and at times it does look quite gorgeous.

    Step right this way into the nightmare/fantasy world of this truly bizarre, freaky and phenomenally weird tale that comes at you straight from hell. Very quirky and curious, The City Of Lost Children (TCOLC) is definitely something of an original (it's actually hard to believe this is even possible in this "been there/seen that" age of filmdom that we live in these days). You can be sure that this is one far-out fairy tale that you'll never, ever see coming to you from the likes of Disney Studios. This undoubtedly strange, and, yes, unsettling little tale is sure to leave quite a lasting impression on the viewer long after the closing credits have rolled on by. Directed with a truly astonishing visual flair, TCOLC puts a unique, new twist (that's very dark and surreal) on the familiar "Mad Scientist" theme. (This is the sort of twisted twist that seems to work its magic about 75% of the time) Set in an awesome "otherworld" of shadows and light, TCOLC's story revolves around the doings of Dr. Krank (a total mad scientist, if you've ever seen one) who has his team of cloned henchmen abduct the young children of the city whom he wants for his experiments. Using a most unusual contraption, Krank (who is aging prematurely) then attempts to steal the dreams of these innocent babes because he, himself, cannot dream. This is one of those films where trying to go into any great detail about its story would only be an utter waste of time. You really need to see TCOLC for yourself to fully appreciate it for the richness of vision that it has to offer. On the down side - 2 of TCOLC's drawbacks were that its story has a tendency to be quite uneven at times and actor Ron Perlman (whom I do not like) has a substantial role in the scheme of things. These 2 deficits are actually quite minor, though, in comparison to the up-side of this mighty weird and entertaining gem.

    I watched this when I was nineteen and very naive. I loved its baroque imagery and began talking about it to my friends. Said it was a strange and amazingly well-produced fantasy like Terry Gilliam's Time Bandits, or Jim Henson's Dark Crystal. I knew that City Of Lost Children rang a little hollow at the end, something about how the characters don't have any real depth and how they enter and leave the story for no reason. But the visuals won me over. That lack of substance is probably why I never watched it again until about ten years passed. I'd recommended it to a friend who'd never seen it. This time around, I saw an entirely new dimension to this film that I was too naive to see before, and it was truly disturbing and too subtle to not have been intentional. It's a weird movie- but not because it looks like Steampunk Paris or has a dream-like plot. Pay some attention to the shots of the little boy eating sausages or other cylindrical objects. Look at the way one is pointed at him as he sits at the table. And the scene of the little girl Miette in bed with the strongman. My friend noticed this too, loud and clear. This movie is like a weird old French guy who's superficially charming and has lots of cool stuff, but is inappropriately interested in little kids.

    This makes Delicatassen - from the same writing-directing team - seem like Rebecca Of Sunnybrook Farm. It's been heavily reviewed on IMDb, well over one hundred posts and all those I read were favorable in the extreme. Alas, it didn't do anything for me but then grotesque fantasy isn't my thing and Jeunet and Caro clearly 'speak' to a lot of people. If you're prepared to put the hours in there's probably a plot of sorts to be unravelled but you need to suspend disbelief on Industrial strength. There is no suggestion from beginning to end of anything remotely resembling life as we know it and/or a recognizable landscape. The main setting appears to be something akin to a North Sea oil rig peopled by fugitives from the Weimar Republic crossed with the Stasi from post-war East Germany crossed with Cyborgs from Star Trek. Apparently the Head honcho is unable to dream for himself so his solution is to kidnap children and snatch their dreams. One muscle-bound circus strong man takes objection when his brother is a victim and goes in pursuit, picking up along the way a street-wise girl lately in the employ of a couple of Siamese Twin Fagins. Dominic Pinon, who is a regular in Jeunet movies, is on hand again. Weird? Check. Wacky? Check. Wonderful? Ah, there you have me.

    Jean-Pierre Jeunet has an interesting directing resume, with Ameile(I loved it), and Delicatessen(lost me), and Micmacs(funny). City of Lost Children is another fantasy with a mad scientist abducting children and stealing their dreams. The cast is wide ranging and the usual odd ball characters portrayed in Jeunet's other works. I was exhausted by the visual throw everything up on the screen and try to follow this marathon of strange behavior. The most interesting role is that of the circus strong man, One(Ron Perlman), who is a good guy trying to rescue the children from the bad doctor. The sets are intricate and colorful but the twists and turns of the story are overdone, without Amelie's wit and charm to save it.

    every time i view this film, i'm always impressed at what a remarkable achievement it truly is. i believe this to be one of the greatest works of visual fantasy since the works of Cocteau. CGI effects movies would do well to study exactly how this film's visuals are applied and used so effectively. even before the popularity of today's CGI driven blockbusters, visual effects in movies could often be "showy" or distracting from the storyline and diminish empathy with a film's characters and situations. not so with 'Lost Children', the visuals only enhance the atmosphere and effectiveness of the story telling. the visuals become a protagonist, of sorts, and enhance each sequence to become more compelling and immerse the viewer emotionally. i've always loved the Disney family classic 'Mary Poppins', and feel it to have a lot of heartfelt message. but the reliance on technical visuals often makes the film a little confusing and feel episodic. there are so many visual effects and ideas that 'Poppins' can leave the viewer a little confused about what is actually supposed to be happening and what it's about. the storyline of 'Lost Children' is rather abstracted, but the viewer never really loses sight of film's actors and their motivations. instead of distracting from the storyline, the visual effects actually make the events more compelling. this film is also superb in every department. the acting, the screenplay, the music and production design, and of course, it's marvelous technology. Ron Perlman's sideshow strong man and Judith Vittet's tough minded street orphan, are two of the most memorable and compelling performances i've seen in cinema. the other performances from the flea circus master to the sinister and horrid Siamese twins, are impeccable. and where in Heaven's name did they find so many cute and irresistible kids. many of these tykes and toddlers are no more than three or four years old and some of them are effective actors as well. even though i would very much recommend this film for children, even if it is a little disturbing and at times frightening, this film is not for everyone's taste. but i would venture to wonder if those people were ever really children or ever had a deep and unexplainable dream or nightmare. dreams are the very fabric this movie is woven of. this film is for anyone who loves and is defensive of children and childhood. and for those who truly believe that their dreams speak to them.

    Many disagree with the previous reviewer. Not sure what the last reviewer watched, but City of lost Children is amazing cinema from the sets, color, acting, lighting, plot, it had everything pushed to the Nth from what I experienced. It is NOT a typical American style movie. It is French and luckily, they are allowed to have an alternate path to interesting movie making. This guy Jeunet puts a LOT into all of his productions. Almost a mentally overwhelming amount of style, info and actions (not action packed, but activities that go on in or behind the scene). He also did Amelie which is just as astounding and one of the best films ever made. Watch it start to finish if you don't believe that. The City of Lost Childen extends its name sake across many peoples from the twisted characters that are adults and act like the children they never were, to the children who are lost from being children and must be adults. Not to mention the abductions and the reason for that. So it is a win on many levels. One of the best, and I am so grateful I happened across this bazaar gem of a flick. Wish more movies were as intricately entertaining as this art piece is.

    I'm fine with movies that choose style over substance. I absolutely love Brazil, if that tells you anything. I was totally prepared to see a movie that had minimal plot and coherence, and was ready to simply immerse myself in the 'grotesque and disturbing imagery' as the rating touts. Another thing that intrigued me was the box art, which looked almost Aztec/Steampunkish. I thought that perhaps that type of imagery would dominate the film, or at least figure prominently in it. It did not. Instead the film mainly features imagery and sets from what appears to be the city from Alex Proyas's Dark City if it had been located on a French coastline in the 1940s. But getting to the point, what ruined this movie for me was not that it was to unfocused and lacking in action. It was the filmmakers insistence that everything be so insufferably f*cking goofy. I felt like I was watching a bad rip off of a Terry Gilliam film, made by somebody who completely missed what made his style so great. First of all, this is a tame movie. Not that that is my reason for disliking it, I'd just like to set the record straight. The film's rating is absolutely undeserved. It easily could have been rated PG-13, and contained nothing too disturbing for a young teenager to stomach. And even then, any scene that even began to create a sense of foreboding atmosphere was immediately ravaged by unnecessary and painfully protracted scenes of people acting like mentally damaged infants. Look, its not that I don't "get it". I understand what they were going for here, its just that they f*cked up (In my opinion). To put it simply, an otherwise chilling, absorbing film best described as Bioshock meets Brazil, is marred by disgustingly indulgent characters and camera-work by the filmmakers. For instance, the character of the mad man who kidnaps children to steal their dreams because he cannot have any of his own should be instantly tragic and threatening, a truly fantastic character simply by design. Any hopes of such a thing are tossed aside within the first few moments as he and the rest of his, what I suppose you could call family, scream directly into the camera for over a minute. Without any thought, they instantly reduce what should have been an incredible character with so much potential to a pathetic whimpering baby in the body of a man. They really seem to be TRYING to act stupid and over the top. Why? What's the point? There is no subtlety or really any care given to anything in the film, least of all that first pointless scene. It really seems as though that scene existed for the sole purpose of destroying the disturbing atmosphere that the film was trying to achieve right out of the starting gate. In the end the film had so much potential, and so much style to work with, but it was wasted in favor of the film's oh-so-quirky antics. If this is French dark absurdist comedy, perhaps I'm just more suited to British dark absurdist comedy where the comedy goes hand in hand with the atmosphere rather than the former beating the latter into submission and sticking its @ss into the camera lens.

    This is really one of the best movies I have ever seen, and it is one of my personal favorites. Its imaginative and powerful premise is brought to life by a creative story, excellent acting, skilled directing, innovative special effects, dreamy visuals, and a surreal atmosphere. The City of Lost Children also has a gloomy and chilling soundtrack that suits the movie perfectly. The movie takes place in a corrupt, dismal town filled with orphans, villains, and miscreants. Most of the adults are portrayed as evil, while the kids are the heroes. However, there is one good adult, who befriends the orphans. His brother is one of the many kids to have been kidnapped by the mad scientist named Krane. The scientist is incapable of dreaming, and makes a machine that connects his head to the heads of children. He uses this contraption to haunt the kids' dreams because he cannot dream on his own. He believes his lack of dreams is causing him to age prematurely. But the kids are stuck on the "island" of his laboratory. That is a simplified, condensed summary of the movie. It is sometimes hard to follow though, because of its intricate plot. Many critics have praised its originality, though some have complained that many of its fascinating concepts are not fully developed, or explained. They seem to think that the movie needed to be longer to offer a full explanation. While this argument does have merit, I believe that the movie would have lost momentum, had it been longer. The City of Lost Children is not perfect, but it is a rich and vivid fantasy that is otherworldly, provocative, and moving. It is not for everybody though; some will be turned off by its nightmarish mood, and complex narrative; however, that does not change the fact that it is an engaging and refreshing film, in that it is totally original. The City of Lost Children showcases enormous talent and ability, in so many areas: story, direction, characterization, visuals, music, and acting are all top notch. It is certainly one of the most original movies of the decade, and one of the most imaginative and compelling films I have ever seen.

    The critics don't know what to make of this movie but give it a good rating anyway. Me, I definitely know what to make of this movie and consider it a masterpiece of film making. The French are very much the artists. They create the Eifiel Tower, the Statue of Liberty, and the Cannes Film Festival. When it comes to making a movie, they know how to do it, and the City of Lost Children is one such movie. The critics cannot seem to understand the plot, and that is probably because they are too stupid to see it. A scientist, Krank, cannot dream, so he kidnaps children and attempts to steal their dreams. Unfortunately the children cannot have good dreams so he ends up with nightmares which inevitably kill the children. A young boy, Dedree, is kidnapped by the Cyclops, a fanatical cult that have blinded themselves and wear an electronic eye, and is sold to the scientist. Dedree's big brother, One, seeks him but becomes embroiled in an Oliver Twist gang ring led by a siamese twin known as Octopus. This is said to have been the most expensive French film ever made, and visually it shows it. The City of Lost Children is a movie which soars above the Hollywood blockbusters in visual masterpiece. The directors seem to have their own little quirks in here, like the snowball events. That is something happens which causes something else to happen, which ends up saving the heroes. The final one is a classic, where one tear ends up causing a ship to smash into a dock. There are some visuals which call back images of Alien Resurrection, such as the babies in a survival tank. What is interesting is how most of the movie is green and that there is a lot of water. This is a contrast to Delicatessen which is yellow and very dry. The City of Lost Children is a fantasy. It has the feel of a Jules Verne style of science fiction but it seems to be more of a future in the past. Rather that being critical of what should be and what should not be, we should just look at this as being in a realm somewhere between fantasy and reality.

    every time i view this film, i'm always impressed at what a remarkable achievement it truly is. i believe this to be one of the greatest works of visual fantasy since the works of Cocteau. CGI effects movies would do well to study exactly how this film's visuals are applied and used so effectively. even before the popularity of today's CGI driven blockbusters, visual effects in movies could often be "showy" or distracting from the storyline and diminish empathy with a film's characters and situations. not so with 'Lost Children', the visuals only enhance the atmosphere and effectiveness of the story telling. the visuals become a protagonist, of sorts, and enhance each sequence to become more compelling and immerse the viewer emotionally. i've always loved the Disney family classic 'Mary Poppins', and feel it to have a lot of heartfelt message. but the reliance on technical visuals often makes the film a little confusing and feel episodic. there are so many visual effects and ideas that 'Poppins' can leave the viewer a little confused about what is actually supposed to be happening and what it's about. the storyline of 'Lost Children' is rather abstracted, but the viewer never really loses sight of film's actors and their motivations. instead of distracting from the storyline, the visual effects actually make the events more compelling. this film is also superb in every department. the acting, the screenplay, the music and production design, and of course, it's marvelous technology. Ron Perlman's sideshow strong man and Judith Vittet's tough minded street orphan, are two of the most memorable and compelling performances i've seen in cinema. the other performances from the flea circus master to the sinister and horrid Siamese twins, are impeccable. and where in Heaven's name did they find so many cute and irresistible kids. many of these tykes and toddlers are no more than three or four years old and some of them are effective actors as well. even though i would very much recommend this film for children, even if it is a little disturbing and at times frightening, this film is not for everyone's taste. but i would venture to wonder if those people were ever really children or ever had a deep and unexplainable dream or nightmare. dreams are the very fabric this movie is woven of. this film is for anyone who loves and is defensive of children and childhood. and for those who truly believe that their dreams speak to them.

    Many disagree with the previous reviewer. Not sure what the last reviewer watched, but City of lost Children is amazing cinema from the sets, color, acting, lighting, plot, it had everything pushed to the Nth from what I experienced. It is NOT a typical American style movie. It is French and luckily, they are allowed to have an alternate path to interesting movie making. This guy Jeunet puts a LOT into all of his productions. Almost a mentally overwhelming amount of style, info and actions (not action packed, but activities that go on in or behind the scene). He also did Amelie which is just as astounding and one of the best films ever made. Watch it start to finish if you don't believe that. The City of Lost Childen extends its name sake across many peoples from the twisted characters that are adults and act like the children they never were, to the children who are lost from being children and must be adults. Not to mention the abductions and the reason for that. So it is a win on many levels. One of the best, and I am so grateful I happened across this bazaar gem of a flick. Wish more movies were as intricately entertaining as this art piece is.

    I'm fine with movies that choose style over substance. I absolutely love Brazil, if that tells you anything. I was totally prepared to see a movie that had minimal plot and coherence, and was ready to simply immerse myself in the 'grotesque and disturbing imagery' as the rating touts. Another thing that intrigued me was the box art, which looked almost Aztec/Steampunkish. I thought that perhaps that type of imagery would dominate the film, or at least figure prominently in it. It did not. Instead the film mainly features imagery and sets from what appears to be the city from Alex Proyas's Dark City if it had been located on a French coastline in the 1940s. But getting to the point, what ruined this movie for me was not that it was to unfocused and lacking in action. It was the filmmakers insistence that everything be so insufferably f*cking goofy. I felt like I was watching a bad rip off of a Terry Gilliam film, made by somebody who completely missed what made his style so great. First of all, this is a tame movie. Not that that is my reason for disliking it, I'd just like to set the record straight. The film's rating is absolutely undeserved. It easily could have been rated PG-13, and contained nothing too disturbing for a young teenager to stomach. And even then, any scene that even began to create a sense of foreboding atmosphere was immediately ravaged by unnecessary and painfully protracted scenes of people acting like mentally damaged infants. Look, its not that I don't "get it". I understand what they were going for here, its just that they f*cked up (In my opinion). To put it simply, an otherwise chilling, absorbing film best described as Bioshock meets Brazil, is marred by disgustingly indulgent characters and camera-work by the filmmakers. For instance, the character of the mad man who kidnaps children to steal their dreams because he cannot have any of his own should be instantly tragic and threatening, a truly fantastic character simply by design. Any hopes of such a thing are tossed aside within the first few moments as he and the rest of his, what I suppose you could call family, scream directly into the camera for over a minute. Without any thought, they instantly reduce what should have been an incredible character with so much potential to a pathetic whimpering baby in the body of a man. They really seem to be TRYING to act stupid and over the top. Why? What's the point? There is no subtlety or really any care given to anything in the film, least of all that first pointless scene. It really seems as though that scene existed for the sole purpose of destroying the disturbing atmosphere that the film was trying to achieve right out of the starting gate. In the end the film had so much potential, and so much style to work with, but it was wasted in favor of the film's oh-so-quirky antics. If this is French dark absurdist comedy, perhaps I'm just more suited to British dark absurdist comedy where the comedy goes hand in hand with the atmosphere rather than the former beating the latter into submission and sticking its @ss into the camera lens.

    This is really one of the best movies I have ever seen, and it is one of my personal favorites. Its imaginative and powerful premise is brought to life by a creative story, excellent acting, skilled directing, innovative special effects, dreamy visuals, and a surreal atmosphere. The City of Lost Children also has a gloomy and chilling soundtrack that suits the movie perfectly. The movie takes place in a corrupt, dismal town filled with orphans, villains, and miscreants. Most of the adults are portrayed as evil, while the kids are the heroes. However, there is one good adult, who befriends the orphans. His brother is one of the many kids to have been kidnapped by the mad scientist named Krane. The scientist is incapable of dreaming, and makes a machine that connects his head to the heads of children. He uses this contraption to haunt the kids' dreams because he cannot dream on his own. He believes his lack of dreams is causing him to age prematurely. But the kids are stuck on the "island" of his laboratory. That is a simplified, condensed summary of the movie. It is sometimes hard to follow though, because of its intricate plot. Many critics have praised its originality, though some have complained that many of its fascinating concepts are not fully developed, or explained. They seem to think that the movie needed to be longer to offer a full explanation. While this argument does have merit, I believe that the movie would have lost momentum, had it been longer. The City of Lost Children is not perfect, but it is a rich and vivid fantasy that is otherworldly, provocative, and moving. It is not for everybody though; some will be turned off by its nightmarish mood, and complex narrative; however, that does not change the fact that it is an engaging and refreshing film, in that it is totally original. The City of Lost Children showcases enormous talent and ability, in so many areas: story, direction, characterization, visuals, music, and acting are all top notch. It is certainly one of the most original movies of the decade, and one of the most imaginative and compelling films I have ever seen.

    The critics don't know what to make of this movie but give it a good rating anyway. Me, I definitely know what to make of this movie and consider it a masterpiece of film making. The French are very much the artists. They create the Eifiel Tower, the Statue of Liberty, and the Cannes Film Festival. When it comes to making a movie, they know how to do it, and the City of Lost Children is one such movie. The critics cannot seem to understand the plot, and that is probably because they are too stupid to see it. A scientist, Krank, cannot dream, so he kidnaps children and attempts to steal their dreams. Unfortunately the children cannot have good dreams so he ends up with nightmares which inevitably kill the children. A young boy, Dedree, is kidnapped by the Cyclops, a fanatical cult that have blinded themselves and wear an electronic eye, and is sold to the scientist. Dedree's big brother, One, seeks him but becomes embroiled in an Oliver Twist gang ring led by a siamese twin known as Octopus. This is said to have been the most expensive French film ever made, and visually it shows it. The City of Lost Children is a movie which soars above the Hollywood blockbusters in visual masterpiece. The directors seem to have their own little quirks in here, like the snowball events. That is something happens which causes something else to happen, which ends up saving the heroes. The final one is a classic, where one tear ends up causing a ship to smash into a dock. There are some visuals which call back images of Alien Resurrection, such as the babies in a survival tank. What is interesting is how most of the movie is green and that there is a lot of water. This is a contrast to Delicatessen which is yellow and very dry. The City of Lost Children is a fantasy. It has the feel of a Jules Verne style of science fiction but it seems to be more of a future in the past. Rather that being critical of what should be and what should not be, we should just look at this as being in a realm somewhere between fantasy and reality.

    The City of Lost Children is the follow up to French directors Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunet's popular and critical hit Delicatessen. It wasn't as successful as that earlier movie though. But despite not connecting with a wide audience it almost immediately became a cult movie. To date it is the last film that these two cinematic stylists have made together. To be honest, it isn't necessarily surprising that this one didn't do as well commercially as Delicatessen. Despite sharing a lot of visual ideas and having similar humour and general setting, the story by comparison is quite messy and not necessarily clear for a lot of first time viewers. The set-up is considerably more expansive than in Delicatessen though; where that one was almost exclusively based in a single tenement block, this one incorporates many locations  in the city, under the sea, on a converted oil rig  and this is really the chief strength of the film. The sets, props and costumes are all very well designed indeed. The look has that quite specific retro-future styling that Caro and Jeunet are so fond of. The detailed set-design, stylised gloomy colour scheme and controlled lighting really works well and creates an atmosphere and tone all of its own. It's the visual ideas that are definitely the real draw here. The story is somewhat less engaging. It's about an evil scientist called Krank who cannot dream. He kidnaps children in order to steal their dreams. He sends out his henchmen, the cyclops, to carry out this evil task. One day they steal the brother of a circus strongman called One who then, with the help of a little girl thief, sets out on a rescue mission. There's a few other things going on in the story but it's not especially brilliant and seems more like a means to an end; a framework that allows the directors to create their visual artistry. Having said that there are individual scenes that are well worked out such as the whole sequence down by the harbour. There are some interesting characters too such as the evil Siamese twins, known simply as The Octopus. Ron Perlman is good enough as One but better is the young performer Judith Vittet as the little thief Crumb, while Dominique Pinon is excellent in the role of the clones  he is so convincing you really do forget that it isn't four different actors on screen. For me this is not as successful as Delicatessen but it's certainly an extremely worthwhile film. It's a very interesting blend of sci-fi and fantasy and at times it does look quite gorgeous.

    Step right this way into the nightmare/fantasy world of this truly bizarre, freaky and phenomenally weird tale that comes at you straight from hell. Very quirky and curious, The City Of Lost Children (TCOLC) is definitely something of an original (it's actually hard to believe this is even possible in this "been there/seen that" age of filmdom that we live in these days). You can be sure that this is one far-out fairy tale that you'll never, ever see coming to you from the likes of Disney Studios. This undoubtedly strange, and, yes, unsettling little tale is sure to leave quite a lasting impression on the viewer long after the closing credits have rolled on by. Directed with a truly astonishing visual flair, TCOLC puts a unique, new twist (that's very dark and surreal) on the familiar "Mad Scientist" theme. (This is the sort of twisted twist that seems to work its magic about 75% of the time) Set in an awesome "otherworld" of shadows and light, TCOLC's story revolves around the doings of Dr. Krank (a total mad scientist, if you've ever seen one) who has his team of cloned henchmen abduct the young children of the city whom he wants for his experiments. Using a most unusual contraption, Krank (who is aging prematurely) then attempts to steal the dreams of these innocent babes because he, himself, cannot dream. This is one of those films where trying to go into any great detail about its story would only be an utter waste of time. You really need to see TCOLC for yourself to fully appreciate it for the richness of vision that it has to offer. On the down side - 2 of TCOLC's drawbacks were that its story has a tendency to be quite uneven at times and actor Ron Perlman (whom I do not like) has a substantial role in the scheme of things. These 2 deficits are actually quite minor, though, in comparison to the up-side of this mighty weird and entertaining gem.

    I watched this when I was nineteen and very naive. I loved its baroque imagery and began talking about it to my friends. Said it was a strange and amazingly well-produced fantasy like Terry Gilliam's Time Bandits, or Jim Henson's Dark Crystal. I knew that City Of Lost Children rang a little hollow at the end, something about how the characters don't have any real depth and how they enter and leave the story for no reason. But the visuals won me over. That lack of substance is probably why I never watched it again until about ten years passed. I'd recommended it to a friend who'd never seen it. This time around, I saw an entirely new dimension to this film that I was too naive to see before, and it was truly disturbing and too subtle to not have been intentional. It's a weird movie- but not because it looks like Steampunk Paris or has a dream-like plot. Pay some attention to the shots of the little boy eating sausages or other cylindrical objects. Look at the way one is pointed at him as he sits at the table. And the scene of the little girl Miette in bed with the strongman. My friend noticed this too, loud and clear. This movie is like a weird old French guy who's superficially charming and has lots of cool stuff, but is inappropriately interested in little kids.

    This makes Delicatassen - from the same writing-directing team - seem like Rebecca Of Sunnybrook Farm. It's been heavily reviewed on IMDb, well over one hundred posts and all those I read were favorable in the extreme. Alas, it didn't do anything for me but then grotesque fantasy isn't my thing and Jeunet and Caro clearly 'speak' to a lot of people. If you're prepared to put the hours in there's probably a plot of sorts to be unravelled but you need to suspend disbelief on Industrial strength. There is no suggestion from beginning to end of anything remotely resembling life as we know it and/or a recognizable landscape. The main setting appears to be something akin to a North Sea oil rig peopled by fugitives from the Weimar Republic crossed with the Stasi from post-war East Germany crossed with Cyborgs from Star Trek. Apparently the Head honcho is unable to dream for himself so his solution is to kidnap children and snatch their dreams. One muscle-bound circus strong man takes objection when his brother is a victim and goes in pursuit, picking up along the way a street-wise girl lately in the employ of a couple of Siamese Twin Fagins. Dominic Pinon, who is a regular in Jeunet movies, is on hand again. Weird? Check. Wacky? Check. Wonderful? Ah, there you have me.

    Jean-Pierre Jeunet has an interesting directing resume, with Ameile(I loved it), and Delicatessen(lost me), and Micmacs(funny). City of Lost Children is another fantasy with a mad scientist abducting children and stealing their dreams. The cast is wide ranging and the usual odd ball characters portrayed in Jeunet's other works. I was exhausted by the visual throw everything up on the screen and try to follow this marathon of strange behavior. The most interesting role is that of the circus strong man, One(Ron Perlman), who is a good guy trying to rescue the children from the bad doctor. The sets are intricate and colorful but the twists and turns of the story are overdone, without Amelie's wit and charm to save it.

    The City of Lost Children is the follow up to French directors Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunet's popular and critical hit Delicatessen. It wasn't as successful as that earlier movie though. But despite not connecting with a wide audience it almost immediately became a cult movie. To date it is the last film that these two cinematic stylists have made together. To be honest, it isn't necessarily surprising that this one didn't do as well commercially as Delicatessen. Despite sharing a lot of visual ideas and having similar humour and general setting, the story by comparison is quite messy and not necessarily clear for a lot of first time viewers. The set-up is considerably more expansive than in Delicatessen though; where that one was almost exclusively based in a single tenement block, this one incorporates many locations  in the city, under the sea, on a converted oil rig  and this is really the chief strength of the film. The sets, props and costumes are all very well designed indeed. The look has that quite specific retro-future styling that Caro and Jeunet are so fond of. The detailed set-design, stylised gloomy colour scheme and controlled lighting really works well and creates an atmosphere and tone all of its own. It's the visual ideas that are definitely the real draw here. The story is somewhat less engaging. It's about an evil scientist called Krank who cannot dream. He kidnaps children in order to steal their dreams. He sends out his henchmen, the cyclops, to carry out this evil task. One day they steal the brother of a circus strongman called One who then, with the help of a little girl thief, sets out on a rescue mission. There's a few other things going on in the story but it's not especially brilliant and seems more like a means to an end; a framework that allows the directors to create their visual artistry. Having said that there are individual scenes that are well worked out such as the whole sequence down by the harbour. There are some interesting characters too such as the evil Siamese twins, known simply as The Octopus. Ron Perlman is good enough as One but better is the young performer Judith Vittet as the little thief Crumb, while Dominique Pinon is excellent in the role of the clones  he is so convincing you really do forget that it isn't four different actors on screen. For me this is not as successful as Delicatessen but it's certainly an extremely worthwhile film. It's a very interesting blend of sci-fi and fantasy and at times it does look quite gorgeous.

    Step right this way into the nightmare/fantasy world of this truly bizarre, freaky and phenomenally weird tale that comes at you straight from hell. Very quirky and curious, The City Of Lost Children (TCOLC) is definitely something of an original (it's actually hard to believe this is even possible in this "been there/seen that" age of filmdom that we live in these days). You can be sure that this is one far-out fairy tale that you'll never, ever see coming to you from the likes of Disney Studios. This undoubtedly strange, and, yes, unsettling little tale is sure to leave quite a lasting impression on the viewer long after the closing credits have rolled on by. Directed with a truly astonishing visual flair, TCOLC puts a unique, new twist (that's very dark and surreal) on the familiar "Mad Scientist" theme. (This is the sort of twisted twist that seems to work its magic about 75% of the time) Set in an awesome "otherworld" of shadows and light, TCOLC's story revolves around the doings of Dr. Krank (a total mad scientist, if you've ever seen one) who has his team of cloned henchmen abduct the young children of the city whom he wants for his experiments. Using a most unusual contraption, Krank (who is aging prematurely) then attempts to steal the dreams of these innocent babes because he, himself, cannot dream. This is one of those films where trying to go into any great detail about its story would only be an utter waste of time. You really need to see TCOLC for yourself to fully appreciate it for the richness of vision that it has to offer. On the down side - 2 of TCOLC's drawbacks were that its story has a tendency to be quite uneven at times and actor Ron Perlman (whom I do not like) has a substantial role in the scheme of things. These 2 deficits are actually quite minor, though, in comparison to the up-side of this mighty weird and entertaining gem.

    I watched this when I was nineteen and very naive. I loved its baroque imagery and began talking about it to my friends. Said it was a strange and amazingly well-produced fantasy like Terry Gilliam's Time Bandits, or Jim Henson's Dark Crystal. I knew that City Of Lost Children rang a little hollow at the end, something about how the characters don't have any real depth and how they enter and leave the story for no reason. But the visuals won me over. That lack of substance is probably why I never watched it again until about ten years passed. I'd recommended it to a friend who'd never seen it. This time around, I saw an entirely new dimension to this film that I was too naive to see before, and it was truly disturbing and too subtle to not have been intentional. It's a weird movie- but not because it looks like Steampunk Paris or has a dream-like plot. Pay some attention to the shots of the little boy eating sausages or other cylindrical objects. Look at the way one is pointed at him as he sits at the table. And the scene of the little girl Miette in bed with the strongman. My friend noticed this too, loud and clear. This movie is like a weird old French guy who's superficially charming and has lots of cool stuff, but is inappropriately interested in little kids.

    This makes Delicatassen - from the same writing-directing team - seem like Rebecca Of Sunnybrook Farm. It's been heavily reviewed on IMDb, well over one hundred posts and all those I read were favorable in the extreme. Alas, it didn't do anything for me but then grotesque fantasy isn't my thing and Jeunet and Caro clearly 'speak' to a lot of people. If you're prepared to put the hours in there's probably a plot of sorts to be unravelled but you need to suspend disbelief on Industrial strength. There is no suggestion from beginning to end of anything remotely resembling life as we know it and/or a recognizable landscape. The main setting appears to be something akin to a North Sea oil rig peopled by fugitives from the Weimar Republic crossed with the Stasi from post-war East Germany crossed with Cyborgs from Star Trek. Apparently the Head honcho is unable to dream for himself so his solution is to kidnap children and snatch their dreams. One muscle-bound circus strong man takes objection when his brother is a victim and goes in pursuit, picking up along the way a street-wise girl lately in the employ of a couple of Siamese Twin Fagins. Dominic Pinon, who is a regular in Jeunet movies, is on hand again. Weird? Check. Wacky? Check. Wonderful? Ah, there you have me.

    Jean-Pierre Jeunet has an interesting directing resume, with Ameile(I loved it), and Delicatessen(lost me), and Micmacs(funny). City of Lost Children is another fantasy with a mad scientist abducting children and stealing their dreams. The cast is wide ranging and the usual odd ball characters portrayed in Jeunet's other works. I was exhausted by the visual throw everything up on the screen and try to follow this marathon of strange behavior. The most interesting role is that of the circus strong man, One(Ron Perlman), who is a good guy trying to rescue the children from the bad doctor. The sets are intricate and colorful but the twists and turns of the story are overdone, without Amelie's wit and charm to save it.

    every time i view this film, i'm always impressed at what a remarkable achievement it truly is. i believe this to be one of the greatest works of visual fantasy since the works of Cocteau. CGI effects movies would do well to study exactly how this film's visuals are applied and used so effectively. even before the popularity of today's CGI driven blockbusters, visual effects in movies could often be "showy" or distracting from the storyline and diminish empathy with a film's characters and situations. not so with 'Lost Children', the visuals only enhance the atmosphere and effectiveness of the story telling. the visuals become a protagonist, of sorts, and enhance each sequence to become more compelling and immerse the viewer emotionally. i've always loved the Disney family classic 'Mary Poppins', and feel it to have a lot of heartfelt message. but the reliance on technical visuals often makes the film a little confusing and feel episodic. there are so many visual effects and ideas that 'Poppins' can leave the viewer a little confused about what is actually supposed to be happening and what it's about. the storyline of 'Lost Children' is rather abstracted, but the viewer never really loses sight of film's actors and their motivations. instead of distracting from the storyline, the visual effects actually make the events more compelling. this film is also superb in every department. the acting, the screenplay, the music and production design, and of course, it's marvelous technology. Ron Perlman's sideshow strong man and Judith Vittet's tough minded street orphan, are two of the most memorable and compelling performances i've seen in cinema. the other performances from the flea circus master to the sinister and horrid Siamese twins, are impeccable. and where in Heaven's name did they find so many cute and irresistible kids. many of these tykes and toddlers are no more than three or four years old and some of them are effective actors as well. even though i would very much recommend this film for children, even if it is a little disturbing and at times frightening, this film is not for everyone's taste. but i would venture to wonder if those people were ever really children or ever had a deep and unexplainable dream or nightmare. dreams are the very fabric this movie is woven of. this film is for anyone who loves and is defensive of children and childhood. and for those who truly believe that their dreams speak to them.

    Many disagree with the previous reviewer. Not sure what the last reviewer watched, but City of lost Children is amazing cinema from the sets, color, acting, lighting, plot, it had everything pushed to the Nth from what I experienced. It is NOT a typical American style movie. It is French and luckily, they are allowed to have an alternate path to interesting movie making. This guy Jeunet puts a LOT into all of his productions. Almost a mentally overwhelming amount of style, info and actions (not action packed, but activities that go on in or behind the scene). He also did Amelie which is just as astounding and one of the best films ever made. Watch it start to finish if you don't believe that. The City of Lost Childen extends its name sake across many peoples from the twisted characters that are adults and act like the children they never were, to the children who are lost from being children and must be adults. Not to mention the abductions and the reason for that. So it is a win on many levels. One of the best, and I am so grateful I happened across this bazaar gem of a flick. Wish more movies were as intricately entertaining as this art piece is.

    I'm fine with movies that choose style over substance. I absolutely love Brazil, if that tells you anything. I was totally prepared to see a movie that had minimal plot and coherence, and was ready to simply immerse myself in the 'grotesque and disturbing imagery' as the rating touts. Another thing that intrigued me was the box art, which looked almost Aztec/Steampunkish. I thought that perhaps that type of imagery would dominate the film, or at least figure prominently in it. It did not. Instead the film mainly features imagery and sets from what appears to be the city from Alex Proyas's Dark City if it had been located on a French coastline in the 1940s. But getting to the point, what ruined this movie for me was not that it was to unfocused and lacking in action. It was the filmmakers insistence that everything be so insufferably f*cking goofy. I felt like I was watching a bad rip off of a Terry Gilliam film, made by somebody who completely missed what made his style so great. First of all, this is a tame movie. Not that that is my reason for disliking it, I'd just like to set the record straight. The film's rating is absolutely undeserved. It easily could have been rated PG-13, and contained nothing too disturbing for a young teenager to stomach. And even then, any scene that even began to create a sense of foreboding atmosphere was immediately ravaged by unnecessary and painfully protracted scenes of people acting like mentally damaged infants. Look, its not that I don't "get it". I understand what they were going for here, its just that they f*cked up (In my opinion). To put it simply, an otherwise chilling, absorbing film best described as Bioshock meets Brazil, is marred by disgustingly indulgent characters and camera-work by the filmmakers. For instance, the character of the mad man who kidnaps children to steal their dreams because he cannot have any of his own should be instantly tragic and threatening, a truly fantastic character simply by design. Any hopes of such a thing are tossed aside within the first few moments as he and the rest of his, what I suppose you could call family, scream directly into the camera for over a minute. Without any thought, they instantly reduce what should have been an incredible character with so much potential to a pathetic whimpering baby in the body of a man. They really seem to be TRYING to act stupid and over the top. Why? What's the point? There is no subtlety or really any care given to anything in the film, least of all that first pointless scene. It really seems as though that scene existed for the sole purpose of destroying the disturbing atmosphere that the film was trying to achieve right out of the starting gate. In the end the film had so much potential, and so much style to work with, but it was wasted in favor of the film's oh-so-quirky antics. If this is French dark absurdist comedy, perhaps I'm just more suited to British dark absurdist comedy where the comedy goes hand in hand with the atmosphere rather than the former beating the latter into submission and sticking its @ss into the camera lens.

    This is really one of the best movies I have ever seen, and it is one of my personal favorites. Its imaginative and powerful premise is brought to life by a creative story, excellent acting, skilled directing, innovative special effects, dreamy visuals, and a surreal atmosphere. The City of Lost Children also has a gloomy and chilling soundtrack that suits the movie perfectly. The movie takes place in a corrupt, dismal town filled with orphans, villains, and miscreants. Most of the adults are portrayed as evil, while the kids are the heroes. However, there is one good adult, who befriends the orphans. His brother is one of the many kids to have been kidnapped by the mad scientist named Krane. The scientist is incapable of dreaming, and makes a machine that connects his head to the heads of children. He uses this contraption to haunt the kids' dreams because he cannot dream on his own. He believes his lack of dreams is causing him to age prematurely. But the kids are stuck on the "island" of his laboratory. That is a simplified, condensed summary of the movie. It is sometimes hard to follow though, because of its intricate plot. Many critics have praised its originality, though some have complained that many of its fascinating concepts are not fully developed, or explained. They seem to think that the movie needed to be longer to offer a full explanation. While this argument does have merit, I believe that the movie would have lost momentum, had it been longer. The City of Lost Children is not perfect, but it is a rich and vivid fantasy that is otherworldly, provocative, and moving. It is not for everybody though; some will be turned off by its nightmarish mood, and complex narrative; however, that does not change the fact that it is an engaging and refreshing film, in that it is totally original. The City of Lost Children showcases enormous talent and ability, in so many areas: story, direction, characterization, visuals, music, and acting are all top notch. It is certainly one of the most original movies of the decade, and one of the most imaginative and compelling films I have ever seen.

    The critics don't know what to make of this movie but give it a good rating anyway. Me, I definitely know what to make of this movie and consider it a masterpiece of film making. The French are very much the artists. They create the Eifiel Tower, the Statue of Liberty, and the Cannes Film Festival. When it comes to making a movie, they know how to do it, and the City of Lost Children is one such movie. The critics cannot seem to understand the plot, and that is probably because they are too stupid to see it. A scientist, Krank, cannot dream, so he kidnaps children and attempts to steal their dreams. Unfortunately the children cannot have good dreams so he ends up with nightmares which inevitably kill the children. A young boy, Dedree, is kidnapped by the Cyclops, a fanatical cult that have blinded themselves and wear an electronic eye, and is sold to the scientist. Dedree's big brother, One, seeks him but becomes embroiled in an Oliver Twist gang ring led by a siamese twin known as Octopus. This is said to have been the most expensive French film ever made, and visually it shows it. The City of Lost Children is a movie which soars above the Hollywood blockbusters in visual masterpiece. The directors seem to have their own little quirks in here, like the snowball events. That is something happens which causes something else to happen, which ends up saving the heroes. The final one is a classic, where one tear ends up causing a ship to smash into a dock. There are some visuals which call back images of Alien Resurrection, such as the babies in a survival tank. What is interesting is how most of the movie is green and that there is a lot of water. This is a contrast to Delicatessen which is yellow and very dry. The City of Lost Children is a fantasy. It has the feel of a Jules Verne style of science fiction but it seems to be more of a future in the past. Rather that being critical of what should be and what should not be, we should just look at this as being in a realm somewhere between fantasy and reality.

    Many disagree with the previous reviewer. Not sure what the last reviewer watched, but City of lost Children is amazing cinema from the sets, color, acting, lighting, plot, it had everything pushed to the Nth from what I experienced. It is NOT a typical American style movie. It is French and luckily, they are allowed to have an alternate path to interesting movie making. This guy Jeunet puts a LOT into all of his productions. Almost a mentally overwhelming amount of style, info and actions (not action packed, but activities that go on in or behind the scene). He also did Amelie which is just as astounding and one of the best films ever made. Watch it start to finish if you don't believe that. The City of Lost Childen extends its name sake across many peoples from the twisted characters that are adults and act like the children they never were, to the children who are lost from being children and must be adults. Not to mention the abductions and the reason for that. So it is a win on many levels. One of the best, and I am so grateful I happened across this bazaar gem of a flick. Wish more movies were as intricately entertaining as this art piece is.

    I'm fine with movies that choose style over substance. I absolutely love Brazil, if that tells you anything. I was totally prepared to see a movie that had minimal plot and coherence, and was ready to simply immerse myself in the 'grotesque and disturbing imagery' as the rating touts. Another thing that intrigued me was the box art, which looked almost Aztec/Steampunkish. I thought that perhaps that type of imagery would dominate the film, or at least figure prominently in it. It did not. Instead the film mainly features imagery and sets from what appears to be the city from Alex Proyas's Dark City if it had been located on a French coastline in the 1940s. But getting to the point, what ruined this movie for me was not that it was to unfocused and lacking in action. It was the filmmakers insistence that everything be so insufferably f*cking goofy. I felt like I was watching a bad rip off of a Terry Gilliam film, made by somebody who completely missed what made his style so great. First of all, this is a tame movie. Not that that is my reason for disliking it, I'd just like to set the record straight. The film's rating is absolutely undeserved. It easily could have been rated PG-13, and contained nothing too disturbing for a young teenager to stomach. And even then, any scene that even began to create a sense of foreboding atmosphere was immediately ravaged by unnecessary and painfully protracted scenes of people acting like mentally damaged infants. Look, its not that I don't "get it". I understand what they were going for here, its just that they f*cked up (In my opinion). To put it simply, an otherwise chilling, absorbing film best described as Bioshock meets Brazil, is marred by disgustingly indulgent characters and camera-work by the filmmakers. For instance, the character of the mad man who kidnaps children to steal their dreams because he cannot have any of his own should be instantly tragic and threatening, a truly fantastic character simply by design. Any hopes of such a thing are tossed aside within the first few moments as he and the rest of his, what I suppose you could call family, scream directly into the camera for over a minute. Without any thought, they instantly reduce what should have been an incredible character with so much potential to a pathetic whimpering baby in the body of a man. They really seem to be TRYING to act stupid and over the top. Why? What's the point? There is no subtlety or really any care given to anything in the film, least of all that first pointless scene. It really seems as though that scene existed for the sole purpose of destroying the disturbing atmosphere that the film was trying to achieve right out of the starting gate. In the end the film had so much potential, and so much style to work with, but it was wasted in favor of the film's oh-so-quirky antics. If this is French dark absurdist comedy, perhaps I'm just more suited to British dark absurdist comedy where the comedy goes hand in hand with the atmosphere rather than the former beating the latter into submission and sticking its @ss into the camera lens.

    This is really one of the best movies I have ever seen, and it is one of my personal favorites. Its imaginative and powerful premise is brought to life by a creative story, excellent acting, skilled directing, innovative special effects, dreamy visuals, and a surreal atmosphere. The City of Lost Children also has a gloomy and chilling soundtrack that suits the movie perfectly. The movie takes place in a corrupt, dismal town filled with orphans, villains, and miscreants. Most of the adults are portrayed as evil, while the kids are the heroes. However, there is one good adult, who befriends the orphans. His brother is one of the many kids to have been kidnapped by the mad scientist named Krane. The scientist is incapable of dreaming, and makes a machine that connects his head to the heads of children. He uses this contraption to haunt the kids' dreams because he cannot dream on his own. He believes his lack of dreams is causing him to age prematurely. But the kids are stuck on the "island" of his laboratory. That is a simplified, condensed summary of the movie. It is sometimes hard to follow though, because of its intricate plot. Many critics have praised its originality, though some have complained that many of its fascinating concepts are not fully developed, or explained. They seem to think that the movie needed to be longer to offer a full explanation. While this argument does have merit, I believe that the movie would have lost momentum, had it been longer. The City of Lost Children is not perfect, but it is a rich and vivid fantasy that is otherworldly, provocative, and moving. It is not for everybody though; some will be turned off by its nightmarish mood, and complex narrative; however, that does not change the fact that it is an engaging and refreshing film, in that it is totally original. The City of Lost Children showcases enormous talent and ability, in so many areas: story, direction, characterization, visuals, music, and acting are all top notch. It is certainly one of the most original movies of the decade, and one of the most imaginative and compelling films I have ever seen.

    The critics don't know what to make of this movie but give it a good rating anyway. Me, I definitely know what to make of this movie and consider it a masterpiece of film making. The French are very much the artists. They create the Eifiel Tower, the Statue of Liberty, and the Cannes Film Festival. When it comes to making a movie, they know how to do it, and the City of Lost Children is one such movie. The critics cannot seem to understand the plot, and that is probably because they are too stupid to see it. A scientist, Krank, cannot dream, so he kidnaps children and attempts to steal their dreams. Unfortunately the children cannot have good dreams so he ends up with nightmares which inevitably kill the children. A young boy, Dedree, is kidnapped by the Cyclops, a fanatical cult that have blinded themselves and wear an electronic eye, and is sold to the scientist. Dedree's big brother, One, seeks him but becomes embroiled in an Oliver Twist gang ring led by a siamese twin known as Octopus. This is said to have been the most expensive French film ever made, and visually it shows it. The City of Lost Children is a movie which soars above the Hollywood blockbusters in visual masterpiece. The directors seem to have their own little quirks in here, like the snowball events. That is something happens which causes something else to happen, which ends up saving the heroes. The final one is a classic, where one tear ends up causing a ship to smash into a dock. There are some visuals which call back images of Alien Resurrection, such as the babies in a survival tank. What is interesting is how most of the movie is green and that there is a lot of water. This is a contrast to Delicatessen which is yellow and very dry. The City of Lost Children is a fantasy. It has the feel of a Jules Verne style of science fiction but it seems to be more of a future in the past. Rather that being critical of what should be and what should not be, we should just look at this as being in a realm somewhere between fantasy and reality.

    The City of Lost Children is the follow up to French directors Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunet's popular and critical hit Delicatessen. It wasn't as successful as that earlier movie though. But despite not connecting with a wide audience it almost immediately became a cult movie. To date it is the last film that these two cinematic stylists have made together. To be honest, it isn't necessarily surprising that this one didn't do as well commercially as Delicatessen. Despite sharing a lot of visual ideas and having similar humour and general setting, the story by comparison is quite messy and not necessarily clear for a lot of first time viewers. The set-up is considerably more expansive than in Delicatessen though; where that one was almost exclusively based in a single tenement block, this one incorporates many locations  in the city, under the sea, on a converted oil rig  and this is really the chief strength of the film. The sets, props and costumes are all very well designed indeed. The look has that quite specific retro-future styling that Caro and Jeunet are so fond of. The detailed set-design, stylised gloomy colour scheme and controlled lighting really works well and creates an atmosphere and tone all of its own. It's the visual ideas that are definitely the real draw here. The story is somewhat less engaging. It's about an evil scientist called Krank who cannot dream. He kidnaps children in order to steal their dreams. He sends out his henchmen, the cyclops, to carry out this evil task. One day they steal the brother of a circus strongman called One who then, with the help of a little girl thief, sets out on a rescue mission. There's a few other things going on in the story but it's not especially brilliant and seems more like a means to an end; a framework that allows the directors to create their visual artistry. Having said that there are individual scenes that are well worked out such as the whole sequence down by the harbour. There are some interesting characters too such as the evil Siamese twins, known simply as The Octopus. Ron Perlman is good enough as One but better is the young performer Judith Vittet as the little thief Crumb, while Dominique Pinon is excellent in the role of the clones  he is so convincing you really do forget that it isn't four different actors on screen. For me this is not as successful as Delicatessen but it's certainly an extremely worthwhile film. It's a very interesting blend of sci-fi and fantasy and at times it does look quite gorgeous.

    Step right this way into the nightmare/fantasy world of this truly bizarre, freaky and phenomenally weird tale that comes at you straight from hell. Very quirky and curious, The City Of Lost Children (TCOLC) is definitely something of an original (it's actually hard to believe this is even possible in this "been there/seen that" age of filmdom that we live in these days). You can be sure that this is one far-out fairy tale that you'll never, ever see coming to you from the likes of Disney Studios. This undoubtedly strange, and, yes, unsettling little tale is sure to leave quite a lasting impression on the viewer long after the closing credits have rolled on by. Directed with a truly astonishing visual flair, TCOLC puts a unique, new twist (that's very dark and surreal) on the familiar "Mad Scientist" theme. (This is the sort of twisted twist that seems to work its magic about 75% of the time) Set in an awesome "otherworld" of shadows and light, TCOLC's story revolves around the doings of Dr. Krank (a total mad scientist, if you've ever seen one) who has his team of cloned henchmen abduct the young children of the city whom he wants for his experiments. Using a most unusual contraption, Krank (who is aging prematurely) then attempts to steal the dreams of these innocent babes because he, himself, cannot dream. This is one of those films where trying to go into any great detail about its story would only be an utter waste of time. You really need to see TCOLC for yourself to fully appreciate it for the richness of vision that it has to offer. On the down side - 2 of TCOLC's drawbacks were that its story has a tendency to be quite uneven at times and actor Ron Perlman (whom I do not like) has a substantial role in the scheme of things. These 2 deficits are actually quite minor, though, in comparison to the up-side of this mighty weird and entertaining gem.

    I watched this when I was nineteen and very naive. I loved its baroque imagery and began talking about it to my friends. Said it was a strange and amazingly well-produced fantasy like Terry Gilliam's Time Bandits, or Jim Henson's Dark Crystal. I knew that City Of Lost Children rang a little hollow at the end, something about how the characters don't have any real depth and how they enter and leave the story for no reason. But the visuals won me over. That lack of substance is probably why I never watched it again until about ten years passed. I'd recommended it to a friend who'd never seen it. This time around, I saw an entirely new dimension to this film that I was too naive to see before, and it was truly disturbing and too subtle to not have been intentional. It's a weird movie- but not because it looks like Steampunk Paris or has a dream-like plot. Pay some attention to the shots of the little boy eating sausages or other cylindrical objects. Look at the way one is pointed at him as he sits at the table. And the scene of the little girl Miette in bed with the strongman. My friend noticed this too, loud and clear. This movie is like a weird old French guy who's superficially charming and has lots of cool stuff, but is inappropriately interested in little kids.

    This makes Delicatassen - from the same writing-directing team - seem like Rebecca Of Sunnybrook Farm. It's been heavily reviewed on IMDb, well over one hundred posts and all those I read were favorable in the extreme. Alas, it didn't do anything for me but then grotesque fantasy isn't my thing and Jeunet and Caro clearly 'speak' to a lot of people. If you're prepared to put the hours in there's probably a plot of sorts to be unravelled but you need to suspend disbelief on Industrial strength. There is no suggestion from beginning to end of anything remotely resembling life as we know it and/or a recognizable landscape. The main setting appears to be something akin to a North Sea oil rig peopled by fugitives from the Weimar Republic crossed with the Stasi from post-war East Germany crossed with Cyborgs from Star Trek. Apparently the Head honcho is unable to dream for himself so his solution is to kidnap children and snatch their dreams. One muscle-bound circus strong man takes objection when his brother is a victim and goes in pursuit, picking up along the way a street-wise girl lately in the employ of a couple of Siamese Twin Fagins. Dominic Pinon, who is a regular in Jeunet movies, is on hand again. Weird? Check. Wacky? Check. Wonderful? Ah, there you have me.

    Jean-Pierre Jeunet has an interesting directing resume, with Ameile(I loved it), and Delicatessen(lost me), and Micmacs(funny). City of Lost Children is another fantasy with a mad scientist abducting children and stealing their dreams. The cast is wide ranging and the usual odd ball characters portrayed in Jeunet's other works. I was exhausted by the visual throw everything up on the screen and try to follow this marathon of strange behavior. The most interesting role is that of the circus strong man, One(Ron Perlman), who is a good guy trying to rescue the children from the bad doctor. The sets are intricate and colorful but the twists and turns of the story are overdone, without Amelie's wit and charm to save it.

    every time i view this film, i'm always impressed at what a remarkable achievement it truly is. i believe this to be one of the greatest works of visual fantasy since the works of Cocteau. CGI effects movies would do well to study exactly how this film's visuals are applied and used so effectively. even before the popularity of today's CGI driven blockbusters, visual effects in movies could often be "showy" or distracting from the storyline and diminish empathy with a film's characters and situations. not so with 'Lost Children', the visuals only enhance the atmosphere and effectiveness of the story telling. the visuals become a protagonist, of sorts, and enhance each sequence to become more compelling and immerse the viewer emotionally. i've always loved the Disney family classic 'Mary Poppins', and feel it to have a lot of heartfelt message. but the reliance on technical visuals often makes the film a little confusing and feel episodic. there are so many visual effects and ideas that 'Poppins' can leave the viewer a little confused about what is actually supposed to be happening and what it's about. the storyline of 'Lost Children' is rather abstracted, but the viewer never really loses sight of film's actors and their motivations. instead of distracting from the storyline, the visual effects actually make the events more compelling. this film is also superb in every department. the acting, the screenplay, the music and production design, and of course, it's marvelous technology. Ron Perlman's sideshow strong man and Judith Vittet's tough minded street orphan, are two of the most memorable and compelling performances i've seen in cinema. the other performances from the flea circus master to the sinister and horrid Siamese twins, are impeccable. and where in Heaven's name did they find so many cute and irresistible kids. many of these tykes and toddlers are no more than three or four years old and some of them are effective actors as well. even though i would very much recommend this film for children, even if it is a little disturbing and at times frightening, this film is not for everyone's taste. but i would venture to wonder if those people were ever really children or ever had a deep and unexplainable dream or nightmare. dreams are the very fabric this movie is woven of. this film is for anyone who loves and is defensive of children and childhood. and for those who truly believe that their dreams speak to them.

Ron Perlman is good enough as One but better is the young performer Judith Vittet as the little thief Crumb, while Dominique Pinon is excellent in the role of the clones  he is so convincing you really do forget that it isn't four different actors on screen. For me this is not as successful as Delicatessen but it's certainly an extremely worthwhile film. It's a very interesting blend of sci-fi and fantasy and at times it does look quite gorgeous.

    Step right this way into the nightmare/fantasy world of this truly bizarre, freaky and phenomenally weird tale that comes at you straight from hell. Very quirky and curious, The City Of Lost Children (TCOLC) is definitely something of an original (it's actually hard to believe this is even possible in this "been there/seen that" age of filmdom that we live in these days). You can be sure that this is one far-out fairy tale that you'll never, ever see coming to you from the likes of Disney Studios. This undoubtedly strange, and, yes, unsettling little tale is sure to leave quite a lasting impression on the viewer long after the closing credits have rolled on by. Directed with a truly astonishing visual flair, TCOLC puts a unique, new twist (that's very dark and surreal) on the familiar "Mad Scientist" theme. (This is the sort of twisted twist that seems to work its magic about 75% of the time) Set in an awesome "otherworld" of shadows and light, TCOLC's story revolves around the doings of Dr. Krank (a total mad scientist, if you've ever seen one) who has his team of cloned henchmen abduct the young children of the city whom he wants for his experiments. Using a most unusual contraption, Krank (who is aging prematurely) then attempts to steal the dreams of these innocent babes because he, himself, cannot dream. This is one of those films where trying to go into any great detail about its story would only be an utter waste of time. You really need to see TCOLC for yourself to fully appreciate it for the richness of vision that it has to offer. On the down side - 2 of TCOLC's drawbacks were that its story has a tendency to be quite uneven at times and actor Ron Perlman (whom I do not like) has a substantial role in the scheme of things. These 2 deficits are actually quite minor, though, in comparison to the up-side of this mighty weird and entertaining gem.

    I watched this when I was nineteen and very naive. I loved its baroque imagery and began talking about it to my friends. Said it was a strange and amazingly well-produced fantasy like Terry Gilliam's Time Bandits, or Jim Henson's Dark Crystal. I knew that City Of Lost Children rang a little hollow at the end, something about how the characters don't have any real depth and how they enter and leave the story for no reason. But the visuals won me over. That lack of substance is probably why I never watched it again until about ten years passed. I'd recommended it to a friend who'd never seen it. This time around, I saw an entirely new dimension to this film that I was too naive to see before, and it was truly disturbing and too subtle to not have been intentional. It's a weird movie- but not because it looks like Steampunk Paris or has a dream-like plot. Pay some attention to the shots of the little boy eating sausages or other cylindrical objects. Look at the way one is pointed at him as he sits at the table. And the scene of the little girl Miette in bed with the strongman. My friend noticed this too, loud and clear. This movie is like a weird old French guy who's superficially charming and has lots of cool stuff, but is inappropriately interested in little kids.

    This makes Delicatassen - from the same writing-directing team - seem like Rebecca Of Sunnybrook Farm. It's been heavily reviewed on IMDb, well over one hundred posts and all those I read were favorable in the extreme. Alas, it didn't do anything for me but then grotesque fantasy isn't my thing and Jeunet and Caro clearly 'speak' to a lot of people. If you're prepared to put the hours in there's probably a plot of sorts to be unravelled but you need to suspend disbelief on Industrial strength. There is no suggestion from beginning to end of anything remotely resembling life as we know it and/or a recognizable landscape. The main setting appears to be something akin to a North Sea oil rig peopled by fugitives from the Weimar Republic crossed with the Stasi from post-war East Germany crossed with Cyborgs from Star Trek. Apparently the Head honcho is unable to dream for himself so his solution is to kidnap children and snatch their dreams. One muscle-bound circus strong man takes objection when his brother is a victim and goes in pursuit, picking up along the way a street-wise girl lately in the employ of a couple of Siamese Twin Fagins. Dominic Pinon, who is a regular in Jeunet movies, is on hand again. Weird? Check. Wacky? Check. Wonderful? Ah, there you have me.

    Jean-Pierre Jeunet has an interesting directing resume, with Ameile(I loved it), and Delicatessen(lost me), and Micmacs(funny). City of Lost Children is another fantasy with a mad scientist abducting children and stealing their dreams. The cast is wide ranging and the usual odd ball characters portrayed in Jeunet's other works. I was exhausted by the visual throw everything up on the screen and try to follow this marathon of strange behavior. The most interesting role is that of the circus strong man, One(Ron Perlman), who is a good guy trying to rescue the children from the bad doctor. The sets are intricate and colorful but the twists and turns of the story are overdone, without Amelie's wit and charm to save it.

    every time i view this film, i'm always impressed at what a remarkable achievement it truly is. i believe this to be one of the greatest works of visual fantasy since the works of Cocteau. CGI effects movies would do well to study exactly how this film's visuals are applied and used so effectively. even before the popularity of today's CGI driven blockbusters, visual effects in movies could often be "showy" or distracting from the storyline and diminish empathy with a film's characters and situations. not so with 'Lost Children', the visuals only enhance the atmosphere and effectiveness of the story telling. the visuals become a protagonist, of sorts, and enhance each sequence to become more compelling and immerse the viewer emotionally. i've always loved the Disney family classic 'Mary Poppins', and feel it to have a lot of heartfelt message. but the reliance on technical visuals often makes the film a little confusing and feel episodic. there are so many visual effects and ideas that 'Poppins' can leave the viewer a little confused about what is actually supposed to be happening and what it's about. the storyline of 'Lost Children' is rather abstracted, but the viewer never really loses sight of film's actors and their motivations. instead of distracting from the storyline, the visual effects actually make the events more compelling. this film is also superb in every department. the acting, the screenplay, the music and production design, and of course, it's marvelous technology. Ron Perlman's sideshow strong man and Judith Vittet's tough minded street orphan, are two of the most memorable and compelling performances i've seen in cinema. the other performances from the flea circus master to the sinister and horrid Siamese twins, are impeccable. and where in Heaven's name did they find so many cute and irresistible kids. many of these tykes and toddlers are no more than three or four years old and some of them are effective actors as well. even though i would very much recommend this film for children, even if it is a little disturbing and at times frightening, this film is not for everyone's taste. but i would venture to wonder if those people were ever really children or ever had a deep and unexplainable dream or nightmare. dreams are the very fabric this movie is woven of. this film is for anyone who loves and is defensive of children and childhood. and for those who truly believe that their dreams speak to them.

    Many disagree with the previous reviewer. Not sure what the last reviewer watched, but City of lost Children is amazing cinema from the sets, color, acting, lighting, plot, it had everything pushed to the Nth from what I experienced. It is NOT a typical American style movie. It is French and luckily, they are allowed to have an alternate path to interesting movie making. This guy Jeunet puts a LOT into all of his productions. Almost a mentally overwhelming amount of style, info and actions (not action packed, but activities that go on in or behind the scene). He also did Amelie which is just as astounding and one of the best films ever made. Watch it start to finish if you don't believe that. The City of Lost Childen extends its name sake across many peoples from the twisted characters that are adults and act like the children they never were, to the children who are lost from being children and must be adults. Not to mention the abductions and the reason for that. So it is a win on many levels. One of the best, and I am so grateful I happened across this bazaar gem of a flick. Wish more movies were as intricately entertaining as this art piece is.

    I'm fine with movies that choose style over substance. I absolutely love Brazil, if that tells you anything. I was totally prepared to see a movie that had minimal plot and coherence, and was ready to simply immerse myself in the 'grotesque and disturbing imagery' as the rating touts. Another thing that intrigued me was the box art, which looked almost Aztec/Steampunkish. I thought that perhaps that type of imagery would dominate the film, or at least figure prominently in it. It did not. Instead the film mainly features imagery and sets from what appears to be the city from Alex Proyas's Dark City if it had been located on a French coastline in the 1940s. But getting to the point, what ruined this movie for me was not that it was to unfocused and lacking in action. It was the filmmakers insistence that everything be so insufferably f*cking goofy. I felt like I was watching a bad rip off of a Terry Gilliam film, made by somebody who completely missed what made his style so great. First of all, this is a tame movie. Not that that is my reason for disliking it, I'd just like to set the record straight. The film's rating is absolutely undeserved. It easily could have been rated PG-13, and contained nothing too disturbing for a young teenager to stomach. And even then, any scene that even began to create a sense of foreboding atmosphere was immediately ravaged by unnecessary and painfully protracted scenes of people acting like mentally damaged infants. Look, its not that I don't "get it". I understand what they were going for here, its just that they f*cked up (In my opinion). To put it simply, an otherwise chilling, absorbing film best described as Bioshock meets Brazil, is marred by disgustingly indulgent characters and camera-work by the filmmakers. For instance, the character of the mad man who kidnaps children to steal their dreams because he cannot have any of his own should be instantly tragic and threatening, a truly fantastic character simply by design. Any hopes of such a thing are tossed aside within the first few moments as he and the rest of his, what I suppose you could call family, scream directly into the camera for over a minute. Without any thought, they instantly reduce what should have been an incredible character with so much potential to a pathetic whimpering baby in the body of a man. They really seem to be TRYING to act stupid and over the top. Why? What's the point? There is no subtlety or really any care given to anything in the film, least of all that first pointless scene. It really seems as though that scene existed for the sole purpose of destroying the disturbing atmosphere that the film was trying to achieve right out of the starting gate. In the end the film had so much potential, and so much style to work with, but it was wasted in favor of the film's oh-so-quirky antics. If this is French dark absurdist comedy, perhaps I'm just more suited to British dark absurdist comedy where the comedy goes hand in hand with the atmosphere rather than the former beating the latter into submission and sticking its @ss into the camera lens.

    This is really one of the best movies I have ever seen, and it is one of my personal favorites. Its imaginative and powerful premise is brought to life by a creative story, excellent acting, skilled directing, innovative special effects, dreamy visuals, and a surreal atmosphere. The City of Lost Children also has a gloomy and chilling soundtrack that suits the movie perfectly. The movie takes place in a corrupt, dismal town filled with orphans, villains, and miscreants. Most of the adults are portrayed as evil, while the kids are the heroes. However, there is one good adult, who befriends the orphans. His brother is one of the many kids to have been kidnapped by the mad scientist named Krane. The scientist is incapable of dreaming, and makes a machine that connects his head to the heads of children. He uses this contraption to haunt the kids' dreams because he cannot dream on his own. He believes his lack of dreams is causing him to age prematurely. But the kids are stuck on the "island" of his laboratory. That is a simplified, condensed summary of the movie. It is sometimes hard to follow though, because of its intricate plot. Many critics have praised its originality, though some have complained that many of its fascinating concepts are not fully developed, or explained. They seem to think that the movie needed to be longer to offer a full explanation. While this argument does have merit, I believe that the movie would have lost momentum, had it been longer. The City of Lost Children is not perfect, but it is a rich and vivid fantasy that is otherworldly, provocative, and moving. It is not for everybody though; some will be turned off by its nightmarish mood, and complex narrative; however, that does not change the fact that it is an engaging and refreshing film, in that it is totally original. The City of Lost Children showcases enormous talent and ability, in so many areas: story, direction, characterization, visuals, music, and acting are all top notch. It is certainly one of the most original movies of the decade, and one of the most imaginative and compelling films I have ever seen.

    The critics don't know what to make of this movie but give it a good rating anyway. Me, I definitely know what to make of this movie and consider it a masterpiece of film making. The French are very much the artists. They create the Eifiel Tower, the Statue of Liberty, and the Cannes Film Festival. When it comes to making a movie, they know how to do it, and the City of Lost Children is one such movie. The critics cannot seem to understand the plot, and that is probably because they are too stupid to see it. A scientist, Krank, cannot dream, so he kidnaps children and attempts to steal their dreams. Unfortunately the children cannot have good dreams so he ends up with nightmares which inevitably kill the children. A young boy, Dedree, is kidnapped by the Cyclops, a fanatical cult that have blinded themselves and wear an electronic eye, and is sold to the scientist. Dedree's big brother, One, seeks him but becomes embroiled in an Oliver Twist gang ring led by a siamese twin known as Octopus. This is said to have been the most expensive French film ever made, and visually it shows it. The City of Lost Children is a movie which soars above the Hollywood blockbusters in visual masterpiece. The directors seem to have their own little quirks in here, like the snowball events. That is something happens which causes something else to happen, which ends up saving the heroes. The final one is a classic, where one tear ends up causing a ship to smash into a dock. There are some visuals which call back images of Alien Resurrection, such as the babies in a survival tank. What is interesting is how most of the movie is green and that there is a lot of water. This is a contrast to Delicatessen which is yellow and very dry. The City of Lost Children is a fantasy. It has the feel of a Jules Verne style of science fiction but it seems to be more of a future in the past. Rather that being critical of what should be and what should not be, we should just look at this as being in a realm somewhere between fantasy and reality.

    The City of Lost Children is the follow up to French directors Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunet's popular and critical hit Delicatessen. It wasn't as successful as that earlier movie though. But despite not connecting with a wide audience it almost immediately became a cult movie. To date it is the last film that these two cinematic stylists have made together. To be honest, it isn't necessarily surprising that this one didn't do as well commercially as Delicatessen. Despite sharing a lot of visual ideas and having similar humour and general setting, the story by comparison is quite messy and not necessarily clear for a lot of first time viewers. The set-up is considerably more expansive than in Delicatessen though; where that one was almost exclusively based in a single tenement block, this one incorporates many locations  in the city, under the sea, on a converted oil rig  and this is really the chief strength of the film. The sets, props and costumes are all very well designed indeed. The look has that quite specific retro-future styling that Caro and Jeunet are so fond of. The detailed set-design, stylised gloomy colour scheme and controlled lighting really works well and creates an atmosphere and tone all of its own. It's the visual ideas that are definitely the real draw here. The story is somewhat less engaging. It's about an evil scientist called Krank who cannot dream. He kidnaps children in order to steal their dreams. He sends out his henchmen, the cyclops, to carry out this evil task. One day they steal the brother of a circus strongman called One who then, with the help of a little girl thief, sets out on a rescue mission. There's a few other things going on in the story but it's not especially brilliant and seems more like a means to an end; a framework that allows the directors to create their visual artistry. Having said that there are individual scenes that are well worked out such as the whole sequence down by the harbour. There are some interesting characters too such as the evil Siamese twins, known simply as The Octopus. Ron Perlman is good enough as One but better is the young performer Judith Vittet as the little thief Crumb, while Dominique Pinon is excellent in the role of the clones  he is so convincing you really do forget that it isn't four different actors on screen. For me this is not as successful as Delicatessen but it's certainly an extremely worthwhile film. It's a very interesting blend of sci-fi and fantasy and at times it does look quite gorgeous.

I was totally prepared to see a movie that had minimal plot and coherence, and was ready to simply immerse myself in the 'grotesque and disturbing imagery' as the rating touts. Another thing that intrigued me was the box art, which looked almost Aztec/Steampunkish. I thought that perhaps that type of imagery would dominate the film, or at least figure prominently in it. It did not. Instead the film mainly features imagery and sets from what appears to be the city from Alex Proyas's Dark City if it had been located on a French coastline in the 1940s. But getting to the point, what ruined this movie for me was not that it was to unfocused and lacking in action. It was the filmmakers insistence that everything be so insufferably f*cking goofy. I felt like I was watching a bad rip off of a Terry Gilliam film, made by somebody who completely missed what made his style so great. First of all, this is a tame movie. Not that that is my reason for disliking it, I'd just like to set the record straight. The film's rating is absolutely undeserved. It easily could have been rated PG-13, and contained nothing too disturbing for a young teenager to stomach. And even then, any scene that even began to create a sense of foreboding atmosphere was immediately ravaged by unnecessary and painfully protracted scenes of people acting like mentally damaged infants. Look, its not that I don't "get it". I understand what they were going for here, its just that they f*cked up (In my opinion). To put it simply, an otherwise chilling, absorbing film best described as Bioshock meets Brazil, is marred by disgustingly indulgent characters and camera-work by the filmmakers. For instance, the character of the mad man who kidnaps children to steal their dreams because he cannot have any of his own should be instantly tragic and threatening, a truly fantastic character simply by design. Any hopes of such a thing are tossed aside within the first few moments as he and the rest of his, what I suppose you could call family, scream directly into the camera for over a minute. Without any thought, they instantly reduce what should have been an incredible character with so much potential to a pathetic whimpering baby in the body of a man. They really seem to be TRYING to act stupid and over the top. Why? What's the point? There is no subtlety or really any care given to anything in the film, least of all that first pointless scene. It really seems as though that scene existed for the sole purpose of destroying the disturbing atmosphere that the film was trying to achieve right out of the starting gate. In the end the film had so much potential, and so much style to work with, but it was wasted in favor of the film's oh-so-quirky antics. If this is French dark absurdist comedy, perhaps I'm just more suited to British dark absurdist comedy where the comedy goes hand in hand with the atmosphere rather than the former beating the latter into submission and sticking its @ss into the camera lens.

    This is really one of the best movies I have ever seen, and it is one of my personal favorites. Its imaginative and powerful premise is brought to life by a creative story, excellent acting, skilled directing, innovative special effects, dreamy visuals, and a surreal atmosphere. The City of Lost Children also has a gloomy and chilling soundtrack that suits the movie perfectly. The movie takes place in a corrupt, dismal town filled with orphans, villains, and miscreants. Most of the adults are portrayed as evil, while the kids are the heroes. However, there is one good adult, who befriends the orphans. His brother is one of the many kids to have been kidnapped by the mad scientist named Krane. The scientist is incapable of dreaming, and makes a machine that connects his head to the heads of children. He uses this contraption to haunt the kids' dreams because he cannot dream on his own. He believes his lack of dreams is causing him to age prematurely. But the kids are stuck on the "island" of his laboratory. That is a simplified, condensed summary of the movie. It is sometimes hard to follow though, because of its intricate plot. Many critics have praised its originality, though some have complained that many of its fascinating concepts are not fully developed, or explained. They seem to think that the movie needed to be longer to offer a full explanation. While this argument does have merit, I believe that the movie would have lost momentum, had it been longer. The City of Lost Children is not perfect, but it is a rich and vivid fantasy that is otherworldly, provocative, and moving. It is not for everybody though; some will be turned off by its nightmarish mood, and complex narrative; however, that does not change the fact that it is an engaging and refreshing film, in that it is totally original. The City of Lost Children showcases enormous talent and ability, in so many areas: story, direction, characterization, visuals, music, and acting are all top notch. It is certainly one of the most original movies of the decade, and one of the most imaginative and compelling films I have ever seen.

    The critics don't know what to make of this movie but give it a good rating anyway. Me, I definitely know what to make of this movie and consider it a masterpiece of film making. The French are very much the artists. They create the Eifiel Tower, the Statue of Liberty, and the Cannes Film Festival. When it comes to making a movie, they know how to do it, and the City of Lost Children is one such movie. The critics cannot seem to understand the plot, and that is probably because they are too stupid to see it. A scientist, Krank, cannot dream, so he kidnaps children and attempts to steal their dreams. Unfortunately the children cannot have good dreams so he ends up with nightmares which inevitably kill the children. A young boy, Dedree, is kidnapped by the Cyclops, a fanatical cult that have blinded themselves and wear an electronic eye, and is sold to the scientist. Dedree's big brother, One, seeks him but becomes embroiled in an Oliver Twist gang ring led by a siamese twin known as Octopus. This is said to have been the most expensive French film ever made, and visually it shows it. The City of Lost Children is a movie which soars above the Hollywood blockbusters in visual masterpiece. The directors seem to have their own little quirks in here, like the snowball events. That is something happens which causes something else to happen, which ends up saving the heroes. The final one is a classic, where one tear ends up causing a ship to smash into a dock. There are some visuals which call back images of Alien Resurrection, such as the babies in a survival tank. What is interesting is how most of the movie is green and that there is a lot of water. This is a contrast to Delicatessen which is yellow and very dry. The City of Lost Children is a fantasy. It has the feel of a Jules Verne style of science fiction but it seems to be more of a future in the past. Rather that being critical of what should be and what should not be, we should just look at this as being in a realm somewhere between fantasy and reality.

    The City of Lost Children is the follow up to French directors Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunet's popular and critical hit Delicatessen. It wasn't as successful as that earlier movie though. But despite not connecting with a wide audience it almost immediately became a cult movie. To date it is the last film that these two cinematic stylists have made together. To be honest, it isn't necessarily surprising that this one didn't do as well commercially as Delicatessen. Despite sharing a lot of visual ideas and having similar humour and general setting, the story by comparison is quite messy and not necessarily clear for a lot of first time viewers. The set-up is considerably more expansive than in Delicatessen though; where that one was almost exclusively based in a single tenement block, this one incorporates many locations  in the city, under the sea, on a converted oil rig  and this is really the chief strength of the film. The sets, props and costumes are all very well designed indeed. The look has that quite specific retro-future styling that Caro and Jeunet are so fond of. The detailed set-design, stylised gloomy colour scheme and controlled lighting really works well and creates an atmosphere and tone all of its own. It's the visual ideas that are definitely the real draw here. The story is somewhat less engaging. It's about an evil scientist called Krank who cannot dream. He kidnaps children in order to steal their dreams. He sends out his henchmen, the cyclops, to carry out this evil task. One day they steal the brother of a circus strongman called One who then, with the help of a little girl thief, sets out on a rescue mission. There's a few other things going on in the story but it's not especially brilliant and seems more like a means to an end; a framework that allows the directors to create their visual artistry. Having said that there are individual scenes that are well worked out such as the whole sequence down by the harbour. There are some interesting characters too such as the evil Siamese twins, known simply as The Octopus. Ron Perlman is good enough as One but better is the young performer Judith Vittet as the little thief Crumb, while Dominique Pinon is excellent in the role of the clones  he is so convincing you really do forget that it isn't four different actors on screen. For me this is not as successful as Delicatessen but it's certainly an extremely worthwhile film. It's a very interesting blend of sci-fi and fantasy and at times it does look quite gorgeous.

    Step right this way into the nightmare/fantasy world of this truly bizarre, freaky and phenomenally weird tale that comes at you straight from hell. Very quirky and curious, The City Of Lost Children (TCOLC) is definitely something of an original (it's actually hard to believe this is even possible in this "been there/seen that" age of filmdom that we live in these days). You can be sure that this is one far-out fairy tale that you'll never, ever see coming to you from the likes of Disney Studios. This undoubtedly strange, and, yes, unsettling little tale is sure to leave quite a lasting impression on the viewer long after the closing credits have rolled on by. Directed with a truly astonishing visual flair, TCOLC puts a unique, new twist (that's very dark and surreal) on the familiar "Mad Scientist" theme. (This is the sort of twisted twist that seems to work its magic about 75% of the time) Set in an awesome "otherworld" of shadows and light, TCOLC's story revolves around the doings of Dr. Krank (a total mad scientist, if you've ever seen one) who has his team of cloned henchmen abduct the young children of the city whom he wants for his experiments. Using a most unusual contraption, Krank (who is aging prematurely) then attempts to steal the dreams of these innocent babes because he, himself, cannot dream. This is one of those films where trying to go into any great detail about its story would only be an utter waste of time. You really need to see TCOLC for yourself to fully appreciate it for the richness of vision that it has to offer. On the down side - 2 of TCOLC's drawbacks were that its story has a tendency to be quite uneven at times and actor Ron Perlman (whom I do not like) has a substantial role in the scheme of things. These 2 deficits are actually quite minor, though, in comparison to the up-side of this mighty weird and entertaining gem.

    I watched this when I was nineteen and very naive. I loved its baroque imagery and began talking about it to my friends. Said it was a strange and amazingly well-produced fantasy like Terry Gilliam's Time Bandits, or Jim Henson's Dark Crystal. I knew that City Of Lost Children rang a little hollow at the end, something about how the characters don't have any real depth and how they enter and leave the story for no reason. But the visuals won me over. That lack of substance is probably why I never watched it again until about ten years passed. I'd recommended it to a friend who'd never seen it. This time around, I saw an entirely new dimension to this film that I was too naive to see before, and it was truly disturbing and too subtle to not have been intentional. It's a weird movie- but not because it looks like Steampunk Paris or has a dream-like plot. Pay some attention to the shots of the little boy eating sausages or other cylindrical objects. Look at the way one is pointed at him as he sits at the table. And the scene of the little girl Miette in bed with the strongman. My friend noticed this too, loud and clear. This movie is like a weird old French guy who's superficially charming and has lots of cool stuff, but is inappropriately interested in little kids.

    This makes Delicatassen - from the same writing-directing team - seem like Rebecca Of Sunnybrook Farm. It's been heavily reviewed on IMDb, well over one hundred posts and all those I read were favorable in the extreme. Alas, it didn't do anything for me but then grotesque fantasy isn't my thing and Jeunet and Caro clearly 'speak' to a lot of people. If you're prepared to put the hours in there's probably a plot of sorts to be unravelled but you need to suspend disbelief on Industrial strength. There is no suggestion from beginning to end of anything remotely resembling life as we know it and/or a recognizable landscape. The main setting appears to be something akin to a North Sea oil rig peopled by fugitives from the Weimar Republic crossed with the Stasi from post-war East Germany crossed with Cyborgs from Star Trek. Apparently the Head honcho is unable to dream for himself so his solution is to kidnap children and snatch their dreams. One muscle-bound circus strong man takes objection when his brother is a victim and goes in pursuit, picking up along the way a street-wise girl lately in the employ of a couple of Siamese Twin Fagins. Dominic Pinon, who is a regular in Jeunet movies, is on hand again. Weird? Check. Wacky? Check. Wonderful? Ah, there you have me.

    Jean-Pierre Jeunet has an interesting directing resume, with Ameile(I loved it), and Delicatessen(lost me), and Micmacs(funny). City of Lost Children is another fantasy with a mad scientist abducting children and stealing their dreams. The cast is wide ranging and the usual odd ball characters portrayed in Jeunet's other works. I was exhausted by the visual throw everything up on the screen and try to follow this marathon of strange behavior. The most interesting role is that of the circus strong man, One(Ron Perlman), who is a good guy trying to rescue the children from the bad doctor. The sets are intricate and colorful but the twists and turns of the story are overdone, without Amelie's wit and charm to save it.

    every time i view this film, i'm always impressed at what a remarkable achievement it truly is. i believe this to be one of the greatest works of visual fantasy since the works of Cocteau. CGI effects movies would do well to study exactly how this film's visuals are applied and used so effectively. even before the popularity of today's CGI driven blockbusters, visual effects in movies could often be "showy" or distracting from the storyline and diminish empathy with a film's characters and situations. not so with 'Lost Children', the visuals only enhance the atmosphere and effectiveness of the story telling. the visuals become a protagonist, of sorts, and enhance each sequence to become more compelling and immerse the viewer emotionally. i've always loved the Disney family classic 'Mary Poppins', and feel it to have a lot of heartfelt message. but the reliance on technical visuals often makes the film a little confusing and feel episodic. there are so many visual effects and ideas that 'Poppins' can leave the viewer a little confused about what is actually supposed to be happening and what it's about. the storyline of 'Lost Children' is rather abstracted, but the viewer never really loses sight of film's actors and their motivations. instead of distracting from the storyline, the visual effects actually make the events more compelling. this film is also superb in every department. the acting, the screenplay, the music and production design, and of course, it's marvelous technology. Ron Perlman's sideshow strong man and Judith Vittet's tough minded street orphan, are two of the most memorable and compelling performances i've seen in cinema. the other performances from the flea circus master to the sinister and horrid Siamese twins, are impeccable. and where in Heaven's name did they find so many cute and irresistible kids. many of these tykes and toddlers are no more than three or four years old and some of them are effective actors as well. even though i would very much recommend this film for children, even if it is a little disturbing and at times frightening, this film is not for everyone's taste. but i would venture to wonder if those people were ever really children or ever had a deep and unexplainable dream or nightmare. dreams are the very fabric this movie is woven of. this film is for anyone who loves and is defensive of children and childhood. and for those who truly believe that their dreams speak to them.

    Many disagree with the previous reviewer. Not sure what the last reviewer watched, but City of lost Children is amazing cinema from the sets, color, acting, lighting, plot, it had everything pushed to the Nth from what I experienced. It is NOT a typical American style movie. It is French and luckily, they are allowed to have an alternate path to interesting movie making. This guy Jeunet puts a LOT into all of his productions. Almost a mentally overwhelming amount of style, info and actions (not action packed, but activities that go on in or behind the scene). He also did Amelie which is just as astounding and one of the best films ever made. Watch it start to finish if you don't believe that. The City of Lost Childen extends its name sake across many peoples from the twisted characters that are adults and act like the children they never were, to the children who are lost from being children and must be adults. Not to mention the abductions and the reason for that. So it is a win on many levels. One of the best, and I am so grateful I happened across this bazaar gem of a flick. Wish more movies were as intricately entertaining as this art piece is.

Using a most unusual contraption, Krank (who is aging prematurely) then attempts to steal the dreams of these innocent babes because he, himself, cannot dream. This is one of those films where trying to go into any great detail about its story would only be an utter waste of time. You really need to see TCOLC for yourself to fully appreciate it for the richness of vision that it has to offer. On the down side - 2 of TCOLC's drawbacks were that its story has a tendency to be quite uneven at times and actor Ron Perlman (whom I do not like) has a substantial role in the scheme of things. These 2 deficits are actually quite minor, though, in comparison to the up-side of this mighty weird and entertaining gem.

    I watched this when I was nineteen and very naive. I loved its baroque imagery and began talking about it to my friends. Said it was a strange and amazingly well-produced fantasy like Terry Gilliam's Time Bandits, or Jim Henson's Dark Crystal. I knew that City Of Lost Children rang a little hollow at the end, something about how the characters don't have any real depth and how they enter and leave the story for no reason. But the visuals won me over. That lack of substance is probably why I never watched it again until about ten years passed. I'd recommended it to a friend who'd never seen it. This time around, I saw an entirely new dimension to this film that I was too naive to see before, and it was truly disturbing and too subtle to not have been intentional. It's a weird movie- but not because it looks like Steampunk Paris or has a dream-like plot. Pay some attention to the shots of the little boy eating sausages or other cylindrical objects. Look at the way one is pointed at him as he sits at the table. And the scene of the little girl Miette in bed with the strongman. My friend noticed this too, loud and clear. This movie is like a weird old French guy who's superficially charming and has lots of cool stuff, but is inappropriately interested in little kids.

    This makes Delicatassen - from the same writing-directing team - seem like Rebecca Of Sunnybrook Farm. It's been heavily reviewed on IMDb, well over one hundred posts and all those I read were favorable in the extreme. Alas, it didn't do anything for me but then grotesque fantasy isn't my thing and Jeunet and Caro clearly 'speak' to a lot of people. If you're prepared to put the hours in there's probably a plot of sorts to be unravelled but you need to suspend disbelief on Industrial strength. There is no suggestion from beginning to end of anything remotely resembling life as we know it and/or a recognizable landscape. The main setting appears to be something akin to a North Sea oil rig peopled by fugitives from the Weimar Republic crossed with the Stasi from post-war East Germany crossed with Cyborgs from Star Trek. Apparently the Head honcho is unable to dream for himself so his solution is to kidnap children and snatch their dreams. One muscle-bound circus strong man takes objection when his brother is a victim and goes in pursuit, picking up along the way a street-wise girl lately in the employ of a couple of Siamese Twin Fagins. Dominic Pinon, who is a regular in Jeunet movies, is on hand again. Weird? Check. Wacky? Check. Wonderful? Ah, there you have me.

    Jean-Pierre Jeunet has an interesting directing resume, with Ameile(I loved it), and Delicatessen(lost me), and Micmacs(funny). City of Lost Children is another fantasy with a mad scientist abducting children and stealing their dreams. The cast is wide ranging and the usual odd ball characters portrayed in Jeunet's other works. I was exhausted by the visual throw everything up on the screen and try to follow this marathon of strange behavior. The most interesting role is that of the circus strong man, One(Ron Perlman), who is a good guy trying to rescue the children from the bad doctor. The sets are intricate and colorful but the twists and turns of the story are overdone, without Amelie's wit and charm to save it.

    every time i view this film, i'm always impressed at what a remarkable achievement it truly is. i believe this to be one of the greatest works of visual fantasy since the works of Cocteau. CGI effects movies would do well to study exactly how this film's visuals are applied and used so effectively. even before the popularity of today's CGI driven blockbusters, visual effects in movies could often be "showy" or distracting from the storyline and diminish empathy with a film's characters and situations. not so with 'Lost Children', the visuals only enhance the atmosphere and effectiveness of the story telling. the visuals become a protagonist, of sorts, and enhance each sequence to become more compelling and immerse the viewer emotionally. i've always loved the Disney family classic 'Mary Poppins', and feel it to have a lot of heartfelt message. but the reliance on technical visuals often makes the film a little confusing and feel episodic. there are so many visual effects and ideas that 'Poppins' can leave the viewer a little confused about what is actually supposed to be happening and what it's about. the storyline of 'Lost Children' is rather abstracted, but the viewer never really loses sight of film's actors and their motivations. instead of distracting from the storyline, the visual effects actually make the events more compelling. this film is also superb in every department. the acting, the screenplay, the music and production design, and of course, it's marvelous technology. Ron Perlman's sideshow strong man and Judith Vittet's tough minded street orphan, are two of the most memorable and compelling performances i've seen in cinema. the other performances from the flea circus master to the sinister and horrid Siamese twins, are impeccable. and where in Heaven's name did they find so many cute and irresistible kids. many of these tykes and toddlers are no more than three or four years old and some of them are effective actors as well. even though i would very much recommend this film for children, even if it is a little disturbing and at times frightening, this film is not for everyone's taste. but i would venture to wonder if those people were ever really children or ever had a deep and unexplainable dream or nightmare. dreams are the very fabric this movie is woven of. this film is for anyone who loves and is defensive of children and childhood. and for those who truly believe that their dreams speak to them.

    Many disagree with the previous reviewer. Not sure what the last reviewer watched, but City of lost Children is amazing cinema from the sets, color, acting, lighting, plot, it had everything pushed to the Nth from what I experienced. It is NOT a typical American style movie. It is French and luckily, they are allowed to have an alternate path to interesting movie making. This guy Jeunet puts a LOT into all of his productions. Almost a mentally overwhelming amount of style, info and actions (not action packed, but activities that go on in or behind the scene). He also did Amelie which is just as astounding and one of the best films ever made. Watch it start to finish if you don't believe that. The City of Lost Childen extends its name sake across many peoples from the twisted characters that are adults and act like the children they never were, to the children who are lost from being children and must be adults. Not to mention the abductions and the reason for that. So it is a win on many levels. One of the best, and I am so grateful I happened across this bazaar gem of a flick. Wish more movies were as intricately entertaining as this art piece is.

    I'm fine with movies that choose style over substance. I absolutely love Brazil, if that tells you anything. I was totally prepared to see a movie that had minimal plot and coherence, and was ready to simply immerse myself in the 'grotesque and disturbing imagery' as the rating touts. Another thing that intrigued me was the box art, which looked almost Aztec/Steampunkish. I thought that perhaps that type of imagery would dominate the film, or at least figure prominently in it. It did not. Instead the film mainly features imagery and sets from what appears to be the city from Alex Proyas's Dark City if it had been located on a French coastline in the 1940s. But getting to the point, what ruined this movie for me was not that it was to unfocused and lacking in action. It was the filmmakers insistence that everything be so insufferably f*cking goofy. I felt like I was watching a bad rip off of a Terry Gilliam film, made by somebody who completely missed what made his style so great. First of all, this is a tame movie. Not that that is my reason for disliking it, I'd just like to set the record straight. The film's rating is absolutely undeserved. It easily could have been rated PG-13, and contained nothing too disturbing for a young teenager to stomach. And even then, any scene that even began to create a sense of foreboding atmosphere was immediately ravaged by unnecessary and painfully protracted scenes of people acting like mentally damaged infants. Look, its not that I don't "get it". I understand what they were going for here, its just that they f*cked up (In my opinion). To put it simply, an otherwise chilling, absorbing film best described as Bioshock meets Brazil, is marred by disgustingly indulgent characters and camera-work by the filmmakers. For instance, the character of the mad man who kidnaps children to steal their dreams because he cannot have any of his own should be instantly tragic and threatening, a truly fantastic character simply by design. Any hopes of such a thing are tossed aside within the first few moments as he and the rest of his, what I suppose you could call family, scream directly into the camera for over a minute. Without any thought, they instantly reduce what should have been an incredible character with so much potential to a pathetic whimpering baby in the body of a man. They really seem to be TRYING to act stupid and over the top. Why? What's the point? There is no subtlety or really any care given to anything in the film, least of all that first pointless scene. It really seems as though that scene existed for the sole purpose of destroying the disturbing atmosphere that the film was trying to achieve right out of the starting gate. In the end the film had so much potential, and so much style to work with, but it was wasted in favor of the film's oh-so-quirky antics. If this is French dark absurdist comedy, perhaps I'm just more suited to British dark absurdist comedy where the comedy goes hand in hand with the atmosphere rather than the former beating the latter into submission and sticking its @ss into the camera lens.

    This is really one of the best movies I have ever seen, and it is one of my personal favorites. Its imaginative and powerful premise is brought to life by a creative story, excellent acting, skilled directing, innovative special effects, dreamy visuals, and a surreal atmosphere. The City of Lost Children also has a gloomy and chilling soundtrack that suits the movie perfectly. The movie takes place in a corrupt, dismal town filled with orphans, villains, and miscreants. Most of the adults are portrayed as evil, while the kids are the heroes. However, there is one good adult, who befriends the orphans. His brother is one of the many kids to have been kidnapped by the mad scientist named Krane. The scientist is incapable of dreaming, and makes a machine that connects his head to the heads of children. He uses this contraption to haunt the kids' dreams because he cannot dream on his own. He believes his lack of dreams is causing him to age prematurely. But the kids are stuck on the "island" of his laboratory. That is a simplified, condensed summary of the movie. It is sometimes hard to follow though, because of its intricate plot. Many critics have praised its originality, though some have complained that many of its fascinating concepts are not fully developed, or explained. They seem to think that the movie needed to be longer to offer a full explanation. While this argument does have merit, I believe that the movie would have lost momentum, had it been longer. The City of Lost Children is not perfect, but it is a rich and vivid fantasy that is otherworldly, provocative, and moving. It is not for everybody though; some will be turned off by its nightmarish mood, and complex narrative; however, that does not change the fact that it is an engaging and refreshing film, in that it is totally original. The City of Lost Children showcases enormous talent and ability, in so many areas: story, direction, characterization, visuals, music, and acting are all top notch. It is certainly one of the most original movies of the decade, and one of the most imaginative and compelling films I have ever seen.

    The critics don't know what to make of this movie but give it a good rating anyway. Me, I definitely know what to make of this movie and consider it a masterpiece of film making. The French are very much the artists. They create the Eifiel Tower, the Statue of Liberty, and the Cannes Film Festival. When it comes to making a movie, they know how to do it, and the City of Lost Children is one such movie. The critics cannot seem to understand the plot, and that is probably because they are too stupid to see it. A scientist, Krank, cannot dream, so he kidnaps children and attempts to steal their dreams. Unfortunately the children cannot have good dreams so he ends up with nightmares which inevitably kill the children. A young boy, Dedree, is kidnapped by the Cyclops, a fanatical cult that have blinded themselves and wear an electronic eye, and is sold to the scientist. Dedree's big brother, One, seeks him but becomes embroiled in an Oliver Twist gang ring led by a siamese twin known as Octopus. This is said to have been the most expensive French film ever made, and visually it shows it. The City of Lost Children is a movie which soars above the Hollywood blockbusters in visual masterpiece. The directors seem to have their own little quirks in here, like the snowball events. That is something happens which causes something else to happen, which ends up saving the heroes. The final one is a classic, where one tear ends up causing a ship to smash into a dock. There are some visuals which call back images of Alien Resurrection, such as the babies in a survival tank. What is interesting is how most of the movie is green and that there is a lot of water. This is a contrast to Delicatessen which is yellow and very dry. The City of Lost Children is a fantasy. It has the feel of a Jules Verne style of science fiction but it seems to be more of a future in the past. Rather that being critical of what should be and what should not be, we should just look at this as being in a realm somewhere between fantasy and reality.
