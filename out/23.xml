 <sinopse>
  A mentally unstable Viet Nam war veteran works as a night-time taxi driver in New York City where the perceived decadence and sleaze feeds his urge for violent action, attempting to save a preadolescent prostitute in the process.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Travis Bickle is an ex-Marine and Vietnam War veteran living in New York City. As he suffers from insomnia, he spends his time working as a taxi driver at night, watching porn movies at seedy cinemas during the day, or thinking about how the world, New York in particular, has deteriorated into a cesspool. He's a loner who has strong opinions about what is right and wrong with mankind. For him, the one bright spot in New York humanity is Betsy, a worker on the presidential nomination campaign of Senator Charles Palantine. He becomes obsessed with her. After an incident with her, he believes he has to do whatever he needs to make the world a better place in his opinion. One of his priorities is to be the savior for Iris, a twelve-year-old runaway and prostitute who he believes wants out of the profession and under the thumb of her pimp and lover Matthew.

    Robert De Nero plays disturbed Vietnam veteran Travis Bickle, who is sickened by the decadence he sees in society, as he drives the night shift in a taxi for a living. He becomes fascinated by an attractive campaign worker(Cybill Shepherd) for a presidential candidate, though her friend(played by Albert Brooks) doesn't like him, she agrees to go on a date with him, much to her later regret. Travis also tries to a help a twelve year old prostitute(Jodie Foster, excellent) to escape her squalid life. Events take a violent turn when he confronts her pimp(Harvey Keitel), and after his unsuccessful attempt on the life of the politician, decides to take on the pimp instead.... De Nero is excellent portraying this sleep-deprived and morally confused man, and director Martin Scorsese effectively creates a hellish atmosphere for the New York streets, but this film is simply far too unpleasant and jarring to succeed. The final shootout and aftermath is so bizarre and ugly, not to mention unbelievable, that it torpedoes the positive aspects, and becomes a misfire, though it is highly acclaimed by some.

    De Niro plays You-talkinna-me Travis Bickle, a loner and a socially inept New York City cabby who takes the job because 'he cannot sleep at night'. As Travis sees more and more of the filth and depredation on the streets he tours, he turns to violence in an attempt to better the world. The movie is insufferably slow and repetitive while it channels the impressions Travis gets moonlighting the streets of New York. The dialog throughout the film feels unnatural and hammy and sucks the life out of an otherwise potentially interesting watch. There's also not much of a plot here which makes the 2 hour viewing quite a challenge. Foster is believable as the 12 year old hooker working for a pimp played by Keitel who sadly fails to convince due to the lackluster script. Cybill Shepherd makes a short and forgettable appearance as Travis his love interest and seems to be cast only for her pretty eyes and patented stare. Though wonderfully moody and well filmed, Taxi Driver is at its core an uninteresting character piece that goes on too long and tells us too little. The music score consists of variations on two jazzy reprises by Bernard Herrmann that are set on repeat throughout the film. When after an hour you hear it being played for the gazillionth time, it starts to become rather silly.

    Robert DeNiro delivered one of the iconic performances of all times. Travis Bickle has become one of the standard by which all performances are judged. Travis Bickle is a disturbed ex-Marine Vietnam vet. He's suffering from insomnia, and spends his nights driving a cab. He's sexually perverted, and obsessed with Betsy (Cybill Shepherd). On top of it all, he wants to save Iris (Jodie Foster) a 12 year old prostitute. Martin Scorsese is making a disturbing movie. It can be hard to watch at times. Scorsese uses his camera to maximum effect. As Bickle's mind drift from his co-workers, Scorsese's camera drift into the antacid fizzling in his glass. The grittiness of '70s NY is all there. Jodie Foster is shocking. Trying to watch Bickle can be a very trying experience. It isn't an easy movie. But it is a masterpiece.

    I watched 'Taxi driver' only recently after I saw how highly rated it was on here. Although the film was enjoyable I have to say I am a little disappointed. The setting was good and the plot also, the dramatic music throughout really made the tension build up. Robert De Niro is a fantastic actor and again he showed this as the taxi driver. I just felt like this could have been so much more, it seemed to take ages to get to the point where you just knew what was going to happen and when it got there it only lasted a few minutes. The action scenes just didn't do it for me. Of course this film is extremely old now and film making has come a long way so maybe that's why I didn't appreciate it as much as others did. It was worth a one time watch but for me I wouldn't regard this as a classic. 7/10.

    Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro, have made eight films together, most are considered to be some of the greatest movies of all time (one of them being Goodfellas (1990) another movie that I've reviewed). And today I'm writing my review for another one of their collaborations, Taxi Driver (1976). A movie about a Viet Nam vet, who takes a job as a nighttime cab driver, and eventually loneliness makes him what to do something violent. Now I normally don't put this up for older movies but I must say SPOILERS, because I will probably be giving away major plot points. Robert De Niro plays our main protagonist, Travis Bickle. De Niro's performance as Travis is the best I've ever seen in a movie, he's able to be a very relatable person with a hint of insanity in him, to the second half of the movie being psychotic, but somehow still likable The rest of the cast did pretty good. Jodie Foster's performance as Iris was good especially considering she was only 14 at the time. I loved the way the movie was able to show nighttime New York. It made it seem very reasonable why Travis hates the scum in the city. The music in the movie, was just a glorious thing to hear, it was mostly the saxophone and it fit the way New York's atmosphere was set up really well. The way the camera moves and catches whats happening, the angles and all are another reason why this is a great one. Palentine is the fictional senator in this movie that Betsy, the girl Travis is trying to date, works for. Betsy is at first a very likable character, but as Travis starts to dislike her so does the audience, a very good feat in the movie. The part when Travis's psychology takes a turn is when he takes a passenger to watch his wife silhouette in another man's apartment. Its a very disturbing and unsettling scene in the movie, but it's also one of the most important moments, because you can tell from the way the passenger is talking about killing his wife with a 44. Magnum and how Travis reacts and looks, that the passenger had given him an idea. This is when the loneliness starts to turn to violence. After that Travis starts to build himself an arsenal. A very good scene is when Travis is buying guns from easy Andy, it's great because of the way it's all played out. Another great thing about the movie is how you slowly start to see what Travis's plan is . Until it's revealed that he's going to kill Palentine, the buildup to the assassination is extremely suspenseful, all the tension rises until, the assassination fails. Most people probably know that the climax of the movie is a shootout among Travis and pimps, and lowlifes to save Iris. It's a very violent and shocking part, for today's standards, I can only imagine what it was like in 76. The movie overall, was downright amazing, one of the best and favorites of the movies I've seen. It's strengths lies in it's excellent performance by Robert De Niro, the amazing directing from Martin Scorsese, the incredible writing from Paul Schrader, the music, everything that's set into motion makes this movie as great as it is, and it earns a 10 out of 10, one of 10 to get this high of a rating form me. Also be expecting more review of Martin Scorsese movies in the following weeks.

    A man who is a taxi driver hates people who are into drugs or prostitutes in the street. He is disgusted by them and takes to the extreme way to mend them. Also, he wants to show the existence of himself to everyone. This film is one of New Hollywood and an empty atmosphere prevails throughout the story. I like a series of films of New Hollywood because the story shows a unique sense of values or a view of the world and the main characters are antisocial, but they have their own idea and try to express themselves and insist on what they think even though it may be wrong. I think this film also tells us that what the right justice is as well as the importance of holding their own justice. It is a deep story. I recommend everyone, especially those who like New Hollywood to watch this film.

    Taxi Driver is among my list of favourite films of all time! The story follows lead character Travis Bickle, (Robert De Niro) an insomniac ex-marine who leads a lonely life. In order to make some more money, he decides to apply for a job working nights as a Taxi Driver. He attends dodgy porn theatres in the day and works long nights meeting all of New York's 'scum' as he calls them. Lots of shady characters litter the story along with a cameo from the director, Martin Scorsese in the back of his taxi cap. Travis' one desire is to be with the woman he sees so very often at the Charles Palantine building, Betsy (Cybill Shepard.) As the movie progresses, you feel an awful as you witness him reach out to people and constantly get rejected, both angering and saddening him. His mind slowly descends into madness and you get the feeling that he soon will be violently out-lashing against the society in general. He begins collecting guns and isolating himself from others; watching boring shows on television and obsessing about a twelve year old prostitute (Jodie Foster) he feels it is his duty to save. He shaves his head into the now iconic mohawk and goes on a gruesome killing spree, murdering several pimps and business men within the whore house. Travis is hailed as a hero which is an attempt to talk about society and the way in some cases, it will justify violence for the greater good. To me, Travis is not a hero but at the same time he isn't your average villain. The character is very carefully crafted, giving the illusion that he is just a lonely man that wants compassion just like everybody else. The problem is, many people can see a bit of themselves within him, as Scorsese has said himself, there are real life Travis' all over the world; he is not some made up character. Robert De Niro's portrayal of a madman slowly going insane, day by day is astounding and highly convincing. This is followed by some extremely strong leads, especially notable is Iris (Jodie Foster), Betsy (Cybill Shepard) and the pimp, Sport or Matthew (Harvey Keitel.) Along with a lot of improvising throughout the scenes, the actors and actresses hold their ground very well and all portray their characters as they would appear in real life. One constantly overlooked scene is in fact very significant. The scene I am talking about is the one where he brakes his television, right before, Travis is looking at a show on TV. It flashes images on couples dancing and having fun while the song 'Late For The Sky' by Jackson Browne plays. The television is actually depicting the life he can never have, on one side, teenagers and youth are out having fun and partying, living like a youthful person should. On the other side, you have a very disturbed man who is loading up on guns and ammunition, isolating himself from people and attempting to for-fill his 'final mission.' Even Wizard, Travis' friend (Peter Boyle) states this when he talks to Bickle outside while they are at the diner. The themes and undertones of this movie is what really makes it something special. Not many films at the time were about alienation, depression, mental illness and anti-heroes. This was one of the first and still holds an impact to this day. The score by Bernard Herrmann captures the feeling and loneliness of New York City. In one part of the score, it has drums that build up suspense, almost like a horror film. Then all of a sudden, it transforms into a calm jazz song played by the saxophone. Variations of this one saxophone piece play throughout the movie. Another cool feature I've noticed, whether intentional or not is during the credits. The camera switches to Travis' point of view as he drives around the streets of New York, looking at many of the interesting sites and buildings around the city. The same slow jazz song plays, it is all quite relaxing. Around halfway through the credits, the music suddenly changes into the suspense part of the piece. Travis then switches his viewpoint from the buildings to people. He is not fixed after the end, he can still descend into the spiral of madness he fought so hard to get out of. He is still alienated and he is still sick. In conclusion, I award this masterpiece 10/10 Brilliant acting Brilliant themes / undertones Brilliant score Brilliant cinematography All in all, I memorable movie that stays with you long after first viewing.

    We are the taxi drivers. We let people in our hearts and minds. Some turn out to be rotten some inspire us. Either way they affect our thoughts and perceptions. Robert De Niro's created an unforgettable image of a taxi driver that longs to find the meaning of his life. No matter if it's a well mannered lady, under age prostitute, stranger willing to kill his own wife, or a presidential candidate. All these people come and go to the life of the taxi driver who is willing to change the system no matter what. Although he himself needs a cure he takes a bold step to become the cure for a young innocent child.

    i trust IMDb's top 250, it didn't disappoint me so far, and yes i am going to trust it in the future. dark knight series, groundhog days, departed, shutter island.. yeah they definitely deserve to be in top 250. but this? seriously? yes the acting of the cast is brilliant. De niro at his best. the idea is also good. but the problem arise when that good idea becomes a film. its completely miserable. predictable. a veteran, there he is driving cabs like a ordinary man, then he got violent and try to save a prostitute by killing people in cold blood (although they deserve it) and he is running free again... seriously? how the hell is he a free man after killing people in cold blood? (i don't know about the American law BTW) i am really confused here, i am giving 5 star rating because initially i really enjoyed the mysterious flow of the movie, and i thought there going to be a awesome twist like in departed or shutter island. but last 20 minutes or so i became really fed up with the movie since what i expected was not there. maybe there is a connection in the movie i don't understood which makes this movie a good movie. but not definitely a masterpiece. i know this review does not give you a better idea, but guys you have to watch it yourself to really understand. some will be agree with me, some not. everyone has different views right? I RESPECT that.

Robert De Niro's portrayal of a madman slowly going insane, day by day is astounding and highly convincing. This is followed by some extremely strong leads, especially notable is Iris (Jodie Foster), Betsy (Cybill Shepard) and the pimp, Sport or Matthew (Harvey Keitel.) Along with a lot of improvising throughout the scenes, the actors and actresses hold their ground very well and all portray their characters as they would appear in real life. One constantly overlooked scene is in fact very significant. The scene I am talking about is the one where he brakes his television, right before, Travis is looking at a show on TV. It flashes images on couples dancing and having fun while the song 'Late For The Sky' by Jackson Browne plays. The television is actually depicting the life he can never have, on one side, teenagers and youth are out having fun and partying, living like a youthful person should. On the other side, you have a very disturbed man who is loading up on guns and ammunition, isolating himself from people and attempting to for-fill his 'final mission.' Even Wizard, Travis' friend (Peter Boyle) states this when he talks to Bickle outside while they are at the diner. The themes and undertones of this movie is what really makes it something special. Not many films at the time were about alienation, depression, mental illness and anti-heroes. This was one of the first and still holds an impact to this day. The score by Bernard Herrmann captures the feeling and loneliness of New York City. In one part of the score, it has drums that build up suspense, almost like a horror film. Then all of a sudden, it transforms into a calm jazz song played by the saxophone. Variations of this one saxophone piece play throughout the movie. Another cool feature I've noticed, whether intentional or not is during the credits. The camera switches to Travis' point of view as he drives around the streets of New York, looking at many of the interesting sites and buildings around the city. The same slow jazz song plays, it is all quite relaxing. Around halfway through the credits, the music suddenly changes into the suspense part of the piece. Travis then switches his viewpoint from the buildings to people. He is not fixed after the end, he can still descend into the spiral of madness he fought so hard to get out of. He is still alienated and he is still sick. In conclusion, I award this masterpiece 10/10 Brilliant acting Brilliant themes / undertones Brilliant score Brilliant cinematography All in all, I memorable movie that stays with you long after first viewing.

    We are the taxi drivers. We let people in our hearts and minds. Some turn out to be rotten some inspire us. Either way they affect our thoughts and perceptions. Robert De Niro's created an unforgettable image of a taxi driver that longs to find the meaning of his life. No matter if it's a well mannered lady, under age prostitute, stranger willing to kill his own wife, or a presidential candidate. All these people come and go to the life of the taxi driver who is willing to change the system no matter what. Although he himself needs a cure he takes a bold step to become the cure for a young innocent child.

    i trust IMDb's top 250, it didn't disappoint me so far, and yes i am going to trust it in the future. dark knight series, groundhog days, departed, shutter island.. yeah they definitely deserve to be in top 250. but this? seriously? yes the acting of the cast is brilliant. De niro at his best. the idea is also good. but the problem arise when that good idea becomes a film. its completely miserable. predictable. a veteran, there he is driving cabs like a ordinary man, then he got violent and try to save a prostitute by killing people in cold blood (although they deserve it) and he is running free again... seriously? how the hell is he a free man after killing people in cold blood? (i don't know about the American law BTW) i am really confused here, i am giving 5 star rating because initially i really enjoyed the mysterious flow of the movie, and i thought there going to be a awesome twist like in departed or shutter island. but last 20 minutes or so i became really fed up with the movie since what i expected was not there. maybe there is a connection in the movie i don't understood which makes this movie a good movie. but not definitely a masterpiece. i know this review does not give you a better idea, but guys you have to watch it yourself to really understand. some will be agree with me, some not. everyone has different views right? I RESPECT that.

    Robert De Nero plays disturbed Vietnam veteran Travis Bickle, who is sickened by the decadence he sees in society, as he drives the night shift in a taxi for a living. He becomes fascinated by an attractive campaign worker(Cybill Shepherd) for a presidential candidate, though her friend(played by Albert Brooks) doesn't like him, she agrees to go on a date with him, much to her later regret. Travis also tries to a help a twelve year old prostitute(Jodie Foster, excellent) to escape her squalid life. Events take a violent turn when he confronts her pimp(Harvey Keitel), and after his unsuccessful attempt on the life of the politician, decides to take on the pimp instead.... De Nero is excellent portraying this sleep-deprived and morally confused man, and director Martin Scorsese effectively creates a hellish atmosphere for the New York streets, but this film is simply far too unpleasant and jarring to succeed. The final shootout and aftermath is so bizarre and ugly, not to mention unbelievable, that it torpedoes the positive aspects, and becomes a misfire, though it is highly acclaimed by some.

    De Niro plays You-talkinna-me Travis Bickle, a loner and a socially inept New York City cabby who takes the job because 'he cannot sleep at night'. As Travis sees more and more of the filth and depredation on the streets he tours, he turns to violence in an attempt to better the world. The movie is insufferably slow and repetitive while it channels the impressions Travis gets moonlighting the streets of New York. The dialog throughout the film feels unnatural and hammy and sucks the life out of an otherwise potentially interesting watch. There's also not much of a plot here which makes the 2 hour viewing quite a challenge. Foster is believable as the 12 year old hooker working for a pimp played by Keitel who sadly fails to convince due to the lackluster script. Cybill Shepherd makes a short and forgettable appearance as Travis his love interest and seems to be cast only for her pretty eyes and patented stare. Though wonderfully moody and well filmed, Taxi Driver is at its core an uninteresting character piece that goes on too long and tells us too little. The music score consists of variations on two jazzy reprises by Bernard Herrmann that are set on repeat throughout the film. When after an hour you hear it being played for the gazillionth time, it starts to become rather silly.

    Robert DeNiro delivered one of the iconic performances of all times. Travis Bickle has become one of the standard by which all performances are judged. Travis Bickle is a disturbed ex-Marine Vietnam vet. He's suffering from insomnia, and spends his nights driving a cab. He's sexually perverted, and obsessed with Betsy (Cybill Shepherd). On top of it all, he wants to save Iris (Jodie Foster) a 12 year old prostitute. Martin Scorsese is making a disturbing movie. It can be hard to watch at times. Scorsese uses his camera to maximum effect. As Bickle's mind drift from his co-workers, Scorsese's camera drift into the antacid fizzling in his glass. The grittiness of '70s NY is all there. Jodie Foster is shocking. Trying to watch Bickle can be a very trying experience. It isn't an easy movie. But it is a masterpiece.

    I watched 'Taxi driver' only recently after I saw how highly rated it was on here. Although the film was enjoyable I have to say I am a little disappointed. The setting was good and the plot also, the dramatic music throughout really made the tension build up. Robert De Niro is a fantastic actor and again he showed this as the taxi driver. I just felt like this could have been so much more, it seemed to take ages to get to the point where you just knew what was going to happen and when it got there it only lasted a few minutes. The action scenes just didn't do it for me. Of course this film is extremely old now and film making has come a long way so maybe that's why I didn't appreciate it as much as others did. It was worth a one time watch but for me I wouldn't regard this as a classic. 7/10.

    Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro, have made eight films together, most are considered to be some of the greatest movies of all time (one of them being Goodfellas (1990) another movie that I've reviewed). And today I'm writing my review for another one of their collaborations, Taxi Driver (1976). A movie about a Viet Nam vet, who takes a job as a nighttime cab driver, and eventually loneliness makes him what to do something violent. Now I normally don't put this up for older movies but I must say SPOILERS, because I will probably be giving away major plot points. Robert De Niro plays our main protagonist, Travis Bickle. De Niro's performance as Travis is the best I've ever seen in a movie, he's able to be a very relatable person with a hint of insanity in him, to the second half of the movie being psychotic, but somehow still likable The rest of the cast did pretty good. Jodie Foster's performance as Iris was good especially considering she was only 14 at the time. I loved the way the movie was able to show nighttime New York. It made it seem very reasonable why Travis hates the scum in the city. The music in the movie, was just a glorious thing to hear, it was mostly the saxophone and it fit the way New York's atmosphere was set up really well. The way the camera moves and catches whats happening, the angles and all are another reason why this is a great one. Palentine is the fictional senator in this movie that Betsy, the girl Travis is trying to date, works for. Betsy is at first a very likable character, but as Travis starts to dislike her so does the audience, a very good feat in the movie. The part when Travis's psychology takes a turn is when he takes a passenger to watch his wife silhouette in another man's apartment. Its a very disturbing and unsettling scene in the movie, but it's also one of the most important moments, because you can tell from the way the passenger is talking about killing his wife with a 44. Magnum and how Travis reacts and looks, that the passenger had given him an idea. This is when the loneliness starts to turn to violence. After that Travis starts to build himself an arsenal. A very good scene is when Travis is buying guns from easy Andy, it's great because of the way it's all played out. Another great thing about the movie is how you slowly start to see what Travis's plan is . Until it's revealed that he's going to kill Palentine, the buildup to the assassination is extremely suspenseful, all the tension rises until, the assassination fails. Most people probably know that the climax of the movie is a shootout among Travis and pimps, and lowlifes to save Iris. It's a very violent and shocking part, for today's standards, I can only imagine what it was like in 76. The movie overall, was downright amazing, one of the best and favorites of the movies I've seen. It's strengths lies in it's excellent performance by Robert De Niro, the amazing directing from Martin Scorsese, the incredible writing from Paul Schrader, the music, everything that's set into motion makes this movie as great as it is, and it earns a 10 out of 10, one of 10 to get this high of a rating form me. Also be expecting more review of Martin Scorsese movies in the following weeks.

    A man who is a taxi driver hates people who are into drugs or prostitutes in the street. He is disgusted by them and takes to the extreme way to mend them. Also, he wants to show the existence of himself to everyone. This film is one of New Hollywood and an empty atmosphere prevails throughout the story. I like a series of films of New Hollywood because the story shows a unique sense of values or a view of the world and the main characters are antisocial, but they have their own idea and try to express themselves and insist on what they think even though it may be wrong. I think this film also tells us that what the right justice is as well as the importance of holding their own justice. It is a deep story. I recommend everyone, especially those who like New Hollywood to watch this film.

    Taxi Driver is among my list of favourite films of all time! The story follows lead character Travis Bickle, (Robert De Niro) an insomniac ex-marine who leads a lonely life. In order to make some more money, he decides to apply for a job working nights as a Taxi Driver. He attends dodgy porn theatres in the day and works long nights meeting all of New York's 'scum' as he calls them. Lots of shady characters litter the story along with a cameo from the director, Martin Scorsese in the back of his taxi cap. Travis' one desire is to be with the woman he sees so very often at the Charles Palantine building, Betsy (Cybill Shepard.) As the movie progresses, you feel an awful as you witness him reach out to people and constantly get rejected, both angering and saddening him. His mind slowly descends into madness and you get the feeling that he soon will be violently out-lashing against the society in general. He begins collecting guns and isolating himself from others; watching boring shows on television and obsessing about a twelve year old prostitute (Jodie Foster) he feels it is his duty to save. He shaves his head into the now iconic mohawk and goes on a gruesome killing spree, murdering several pimps and business men within the whore house. Travis is hailed as a hero which is an attempt to talk about society and the way in some cases, it will justify violence for the greater good. To me, Travis is not a hero but at the same time he isn't your average villain. The character is very carefully crafted, giving the illusion that he is just a lonely man that wants compassion just like everybody else. The problem is, many people can see a bit of themselves within him, as Scorsese has said himself, there are real life Travis' all over the world; he is not some made up character. Robert De Niro's portrayal of a madman slowly going insane, day by day is astounding and highly convincing. This is followed by some extremely strong leads, especially notable is Iris (Jodie Foster), Betsy (Cybill Shepard) and the pimp, Sport or Matthew (Harvey Keitel.) Along with a lot of improvising throughout the scenes, the actors and actresses hold their ground very well and all portray their characters as they would appear in real life. One constantly overlooked scene is in fact very significant. The scene I am talking about is the one where he brakes his television, right before, Travis is looking at a show on TV. It flashes images on couples dancing and having fun while the song 'Late For The Sky' by Jackson Browne plays. The television is actually depicting the life he can never have, on one side, teenagers and youth are out having fun and partying, living like a youthful person should. On the other side, you have a very disturbed man who is loading up on guns and ammunition, isolating himself from people and attempting to for-fill his 'final mission.' Even Wizard, Travis' friend (Peter Boyle) states this when he talks to Bickle outside while they are at the diner. The themes and undertones of this movie is what really makes it something special. Not many films at the time were about alienation, depression, mental illness and anti-heroes. This was one of the first and still holds an impact to this day. The score by Bernard Herrmann captures the feeling and loneliness of New York City. In one part of the score, it has drums that build up suspense, almost like a horror film. Then all of a sudden, it transforms into a calm jazz song played by the saxophone. Variations of this one saxophone piece play throughout the movie. Another cool feature I've noticed, whether intentional or not is during the credits. The camera switches to Travis' point of view as he drives around the streets of New York, looking at many of the interesting sites and buildings around the city. The same slow jazz song plays, it is all quite relaxing. Around halfway through the credits, the music suddenly changes into the suspense part of the piece. Travis then switches his viewpoint from the buildings to people. He is not fixed after the end, he can still descend into the spiral of madness he fought so hard to get out of. He is still alienated and he is still sick. In conclusion, I award this masterpiece 10/10 Brilliant acting Brilliant themes / undertones Brilliant score Brilliant cinematography All in all, I memorable movie that stays with you long after first viewing.

It's a very violent and shocking part, for today's standards, I can only imagine what it was like in 76. The movie overall, was downright amazing, one of the best and favorites of the movies I've seen. It's strengths lies in it's excellent performance by Robert De Niro, the amazing directing from Martin Scorsese, the incredible writing from Paul Schrader, the music, everything that's set into motion makes this movie as great as it is, and it earns a 10 out of 10, one of 10 to get this high of a rating form me. Also be expecting more review of Martin Scorsese movies in the following weeks.

    A man who is a taxi driver hates people who are into drugs or prostitutes in the street. He is disgusted by them and takes to the extreme way to mend them. Also, he wants to show the existence of himself to everyone. This film is one of New Hollywood and an empty atmosphere prevails throughout the story. I like a series of films of New Hollywood because the story shows a unique sense of values or a view of the world and the main characters are antisocial, but they have their own idea and try to express themselves and insist on what they think even though it may be wrong. I think this film also tells us that what the right justice is as well as the importance of holding their own justice. It is a deep story. I recommend everyone, especially those who like New Hollywood to watch this film.

    Taxi Driver is among my list of favourite films of all time! The story follows lead character Travis Bickle, (Robert De Niro) an insomniac ex-marine who leads a lonely life. In order to make some more money, he decides to apply for a job working nights as a Taxi Driver. He attends dodgy porn theatres in the day and works long nights meeting all of New York's 'scum' as he calls them. Lots of shady characters litter the story along with a cameo from the director, Martin Scorsese in the back of his taxi cap. Travis' one desire is to be with the woman he sees so very often at the Charles Palantine building, Betsy (Cybill Shepard.) As the movie progresses, you feel an awful as you witness him reach out to people and constantly get rejected, both angering and saddening him. His mind slowly descends into madness and you get the feeling that he soon will be violently out-lashing against the society in general. He begins collecting guns and isolating himself from others; watching boring shows on television and obsessing about a twelve year old prostitute (Jodie Foster) he feels it is his duty to save. He shaves his head into the now iconic mohawk and goes on a gruesome killing spree, murdering several pimps and business men within the whore house. Travis is hailed as a hero which is an attempt to talk about society and the way in some cases, it will justify violence for the greater good. To me, Travis is not a hero but at the same time he isn't your average villain. The character is very carefully crafted, giving the illusion that he is just a lonely man that wants compassion just like everybody else. The problem is, many people can see a bit of themselves within him, as Scorsese has said himself, there are real life Travis' all over the world; he is not some made up character. Robert De Niro's portrayal of a madman slowly going insane, day by day is astounding and highly convincing. This is followed by some extremely strong leads, especially notable is Iris (Jodie Foster), Betsy (Cybill Shepard) and the pimp, Sport or Matthew (Harvey Keitel.) Along with a lot of improvising throughout the scenes, the actors and actresses hold their ground very well and all portray their characters as they would appear in real life. One constantly overlooked scene is in fact very significant. The scene I am talking about is the one where he brakes his television, right before, Travis is looking at a show on TV. It flashes images on couples dancing and having fun while the song 'Late For The Sky' by Jackson Browne plays. The television is actually depicting the life he can never have, on one side, teenagers and youth are out having fun and partying, living like a youthful person should. On the other side, you have a very disturbed man who is loading up on guns and ammunition, isolating himself from people and attempting to for-fill his 'final mission.' Even Wizard, Travis' friend (Peter Boyle) states this when he talks to Bickle outside while they are at the diner. The themes and undertones of this movie is what really makes it something special. Not many films at the time were about alienation, depression, mental illness and anti-heroes. This was one of the first and still holds an impact to this day. The score by Bernard Herrmann captures the feeling and loneliness of New York City. In one part of the score, it has drums that build up suspense, almost like a horror film. Then all of a sudden, it transforms into a calm jazz song played by the saxophone. Variations of this one saxophone piece play throughout the movie. Another cool feature I've noticed, whether intentional or not is during the credits. The camera switches to Travis' point of view as he drives around the streets of New York, looking at many of the interesting sites and buildings around the city. The same slow jazz song plays, it is all quite relaxing. Around halfway through the credits, the music suddenly changes into the suspense part of the piece. Travis then switches his viewpoint from the buildings to people. He is not fixed after the end, he can still descend into the spiral of madness he fought so hard to get out of. He is still alienated and he is still sick. In conclusion, I award this masterpiece 10/10 Brilliant acting Brilliant themes / undertones Brilliant score Brilliant cinematography All in all, I memorable movie that stays with you long after first viewing.

    We are the taxi drivers. We let people in our hearts and minds. Some turn out to be rotten some inspire us. Either way they affect our thoughts and perceptions. Robert De Niro's created an unforgettable image of a taxi driver that longs to find the meaning of his life. No matter if it's a well mannered lady, under age prostitute, stranger willing to kill his own wife, or a presidential candidate. All these people come and go to the life of the taxi driver who is willing to change the system no matter what. Although he himself needs a cure he takes a bold step to become the cure for a young innocent child.

    i trust IMDb's top 250, it didn't disappoint me so far, and yes i am going to trust it in the future. dark knight series, groundhog days, departed, shutter island.. yeah they definitely deserve to be in top 250. but this? seriously? yes the acting of the cast is brilliant. De niro at his best. the idea is also good. but the problem arise when that good idea becomes a film. its completely miserable. predictable. a veteran, there he is driving cabs like a ordinary man, then he got violent and try to save a prostitute by killing people in cold blood (although they deserve it) and he is running free again... seriously? how the hell is he a free man after killing people in cold blood? (i don't know about the American law BTW) i am really confused here, i am giving 5 star rating because initially i really enjoyed the mysterious flow of the movie, and i thought there going to be a awesome twist like in departed or shutter island. but last 20 minutes or so i became really fed up with the movie since what i expected was not there. maybe there is a connection in the movie i don't understood which makes this movie a good movie. but not definitely a masterpiece. i know this review does not give you a better idea, but guys you have to watch it yourself to really understand. some will be agree with me, some not. everyone has different views right? I RESPECT that.

    Robert De Nero plays disturbed Vietnam veteran Travis Bickle, who is sickened by the decadence he sees in society, as he drives the night shift in a taxi for a living. He becomes fascinated by an attractive campaign worker(Cybill Shepherd) for a presidential candidate, though her friend(played by Albert Brooks) doesn't like him, she agrees to go on a date with him, much to her later regret. Travis also tries to a help a twelve year old prostitute(Jodie Foster, excellent) to escape her squalid life. Events take a violent turn when he confronts her pimp(Harvey Keitel), and after his unsuccessful attempt on the life of the politician, decides to take on the pimp instead.... De Nero is excellent portraying this sleep-deprived and morally confused man, and director Martin Scorsese effectively creates a hellish atmosphere for the New York streets, but this film is simply far too unpleasant and jarring to succeed. The final shootout and aftermath is so bizarre and ugly, not to mention unbelievable, that it torpedoes the positive aspects, and becomes a misfire, though it is highly acclaimed by some.

    De Niro plays You-talkinna-me Travis Bickle, a loner and a socially inept New York City cabby who takes the job because 'he cannot sleep at night'. As Travis sees more and more of the filth and depredation on the streets he tours, he turns to violence in an attempt to better the world. The movie is insufferably slow and repetitive while it channels the impressions Travis gets moonlighting the streets of New York. The dialog throughout the film feels unnatural and hammy and sucks the life out of an otherwise potentially interesting watch. There's also not much of a plot here which makes the 2 hour viewing quite a challenge. Foster is believable as the 12 year old hooker working for a pimp played by Keitel who sadly fails to convince due to the lackluster script. Cybill Shepherd makes a short and forgettable appearance as Travis his love interest and seems to be cast only for her pretty eyes and patented stare. Though wonderfully moody and well filmed, Taxi Driver is at its core an uninteresting character piece that goes on too long and tells us too little. The music score consists of variations on two jazzy reprises by Bernard Herrmann that are set on repeat throughout the film. When after an hour you hear it being played for the gazillionth time, it starts to become rather silly.

    Robert DeNiro delivered one of the iconic performances of all times. Travis Bickle has become one of the standard by which all performances are judged. Travis Bickle is a disturbed ex-Marine Vietnam vet. He's suffering from insomnia, and spends his nights driving a cab. He's sexually perverted, and obsessed with Betsy (Cybill Shepherd). On top of it all, he wants to save Iris (Jodie Foster) a 12 year old prostitute. Martin Scorsese is making a disturbing movie. It can be hard to watch at times. Scorsese uses his camera to maximum effect. As Bickle's mind drift from his co-workers, Scorsese's camera drift into the antacid fizzling in his glass. The grittiness of '70s NY is all there. Jodie Foster is shocking. Trying to watch Bickle can be a very trying experience. It isn't an easy movie. But it is a masterpiece.

    I watched 'Taxi driver' only recently after I saw how highly rated it was on here. Although the film was enjoyable I have to say I am a little disappointed. The setting was good and the plot also, the dramatic music throughout really made the tension build up. Robert De Niro is a fantastic actor and again he showed this as the taxi driver. I just felt like this could have been so much more, it seemed to take ages to get to the point where you just knew what was going to happen and when it got there it only lasted a few minutes. The action scenes just didn't do it for me. Of course this film is extremely old now and film making has come a long way so maybe that's why I didn't appreciate it as much as others did. It was worth a one time watch but for me I wouldn't regard this as a classic. 7/10.

    Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro, have made eight films together, most are considered to be some of the greatest movies of all time (one of them being Goodfellas (1990) another movie that I've reviewed). And today I'm writing my review for another one of their collaborations, Taxi Driver (1976). A movie about a Viet Nam vet, who takes a job as a nighttime cab driver, and eventually loneliness makes him what to do something violent. Now I normally don't put this up for older movies but I must say SPOILERS, because I will probably be giving away major plot points. Robert De Niro plays our main protagonist, Travis Bickle. De Niro's performance as Travis is the best I've ever seen in a movie, he's able to be a very relatable person with a hint of insanity in him, to the second half of the movie being psychotic, but somehow still likable The rest of the cast did pretty good. Jodie Foster's performance as Iris was good especially considering she was only 14 at the time. I loved the way the movie was able to show nighttime New York. It made it seem very reasonable why Travis hates the scum in the city. The music in the movie, was just a glorious thing to hear, it was mostly the saxophone and it fit the way New York's atmosphere was set up really well. The way the camera moves and catches whats happening, the angles and all are another reason why this is a great one. Palentine is the fictional senator in this movie that Betsy, the girl Travis is trying to date, works for. Betsy is at first a very likable character, but as Travis starts to dislike her so does the audience, a very good feat in the movie. The part when Travis's psychology takes a turn is when he takes a passenger to watch his wife silhouette in another man's apartment. Its a very disturbing and unsettling scene in the movie, but it's also one of the most important moments, because you can tell from the way the passenger is talking about killing his wife with a 44. Magnum and how Travis reacts and looks, that the passenger had given him an idea. This is when the loneliness starts to turn to violence. After that Travis starts to build himself an arsenal. A very good scene is when Travis is buying guns from easy Andy, it's great because of the way it's all played out. Another great thing about the movie is how you slowly start to see what Travis's plan is . Until it's revealed that he's going to kill Palentine, the buildup to the assassination is extremely suspenseful, all the tension rises until, the assassination fails. Most people probably know that the climax of the movie is a shootout among Travis and pimps, and lowlifes to save Iris. It's a very violent and shocking part, for today's standards, I can only imagine what it was like in 76. The movie overall, was downright amazing, one of the best and favorites of the movies I've seen. It's strengths lies in it's excellent performance by Robert De Niro, the amazing directing from Martin Scorsese, the incredible writing from Paul Schrader, the music, everything that's set into motion makes this movie as great as it is, and it earns a 10 out of 10, one of 10 to get this high of a rating form me. Also be expecting more review of Martin Scorsese movies in the following weeks.

    I watched 'Taxi driver' only recently after I saw how highly rated it was on here. Although the film was enjoyable I have to say I am a little disappointed. The setting was good and the plot also, the dramatic music throughout really made the tension build up. Robert De Niro is a fantastic actor and again he showed this as the taxi driver. I just felt like this could have been so much more, it seemed to take ages to get to the point where you just knew what was going to happen and when it got there it only lasted a few minutes. The action scenes just didn't do it for me. Of course this film is extremely old now and film making has come a long way so maybe that's why I didn't appreciate it as much as others did. It was worth a one time watch but for me I wouldn't regard this as a classic. 7/10.

    Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro, have made eight films together, most are considered to be some of the greatest movies of all time (one of them being Goodfellas (1990) another movie that I've reviewed). And today I'm writing my review for another one of their collaborations, Taxi Driver (1976). A movie about a Viet Nam vet, who takes a job as a nighttime cab driver, and eventually loneliness makes him what to do something violent. Now I normally don't put this up for older movies but I must say SPOILERS, because I will probably be giving away major plot points. Robert De Niro plays our main protagonist, Travis Bickle. De Niro's performance as Travis is the best I've ever seen in a movie, he's able to be a very relatable person with a hint of insanity in him, to the second half of the movie being psychotic, but somehow still likable The rest of the cast did pretty good. Jodie Foster's performance as Iris was good especially considering she was only 14 at the time. I loved the way the movie was able to show nighttime New York. It made it seem very reasonable why Travis hates the scum in the city. The music in the movie, was just a glorious thing to hear, it was mostly the saxophone and it fit the way New York's atmosphere was set up really well. The way the camera moves and catches whats happening, the angles and all are another reason why this is a great one. Palentine is the fictional senator in this movie that Betsy, the girl Travis is trying to date, works for. Betsy is at first a very likable character, but as Travis starts to dislike her so does the audience, a very good feat in the movie. The part when Travis's psychology takes a turn is when he takes a passenger to watch his wife silhouette in another man's apartment. Its a very disturbing and unsettling scene in the movie, but it's also one of the most important moments, because you can tell from the way the passenger is talking about killing his wife with a 44. Magnum and how Travis reacts and looks, that the passenger had given him an idea. This is when the loneliness starts to turn to violence. After that Travis starts to build himself an arsenal. A very good scene is when Travis is buying guns from easy Andy, it's great because of the way it's all played out. Another great thing about the movie is how you slowly start to see what Travis's plan is . Until it's revealed that he's going to kill Palentine, the buildup to the assassination is extremely suspenseful, all the tension rises until, the assassination fails. Most people probably know that the climax of the movie is a shootout among Travis and pimps, and lowlifes to save Iris. It's a very violent and shocking part, for today's standards, I can only imagine what it was like in 76. The movie overall, was downright amazing, one of the best and favorites of the movies I've seen. It's strengths lies in it's excellent performance by Robert De Niro, the amazing directing from Martin Scorsese, the incredible writing from Paul Schrader, the music, everything that's set into motion makes this movie as great as it is, and it earns a 10 out of 10, one of 10 to get this high of a rating form me. Also be expecting more review of Martin Scorsese movies in the following weeks.

    A man who is a taxi driver hates people who are into drugs or prostitutes in the street. He is disgusted by them and takes to the extreme way to mend them. Also, he wants to show the existence of himself to everyone. This film is one of New Hollywood and an empty atmosphere prevails throughout the story. I like a series of films of New Hollywood because the story shows a unique sense of values or a view of the world and the main characters are antisocial, but they have their own idea and try to express themselves and insist on what they think even though it may be wrong. I think this film also tells us that what the right justice is as well as the importance of holding their own justice. It is a deep story. I recommend everyone, especially those who like New Hollywood to watch this film.

    Taxi Driver is among my list of favourite films of all time! The story follows lead character Travis Bickle, (Robert De Niro) an insomniac ex-marine who leads a lonely life. In order to make some more money, he decides to apply for a job working nights as a Taxi Driver. He attends dodgy porn theatres in the day and works long nights meeting all of New York's 'scum' as he calls them. Lots of shady characters litter the story along with a cameo from the director, Martin Scorsese in the back of his taxi cap. Travis' one desire is to be with the woman he sees so very often at the Charles Palantine building, Betsy (Cybill Shepard.) As the movie progresses, you feel an awful as you witness him reach out to people and constantly get rejected, both angering and saddening him. His mind slowly descends into madness and you get the feeling that he soon will be violently out-lashing against the society in general. He begins collecting guns and isolating himself from others; watching boring shows on television and obsessing about a twelve year old prostitute (Jodie Foster) he feels it is his duty to save. He shaves his head into the now iconic mohawk and goes on a gruesome killing spree, murdering several pimps and business men within the whore house. Travis is hailed as a hero which is an attempt to talk about society and the way in some cases, it will justify violence for the greater good. To me, Travis is not a hero but at the same time he isn't your average villain. The character is very carefully crafted, giving the illusion that he is just a lonely man that wants compassion just like everybody else. The problem is, many people can see a bit of themselves within him, as Scorsese has said himself, there are real life Travis' all over the world; he is not some made up character. Robert De Niro's portrayal of a madman slowly going insane, day by day is astounding and highly convincing. This is followed by some extremely strong leads, especially notable is Iris (Jodie Foster), Betsy (Cybill Shepard) and the pimp, Sport or Matthew (Harvey Keitel.) Along with a lot of improvising throughout the scenes, the actors and actresses hold their ground very well and all portray their characters as they would appear in real life. One constantly overlooked scene is in fact very significant. The scene I am talking about is the one where he brakes his television, right before, Travis is looking at a show on TV. It flashes images on couples dancing and having fun while the song 'Late For The Sky' by Jackson Browne plays. The television is actually depicting the life he can never have, on one side, teenagers and youth are out having fun and partying, living like a youthful person should. On the other side, you have a very disturbed man who is loading up on guns and ammunition, isolating himself from people and attempting to for-fill his 'final mission.' Even Wizard, Travis' friend (Peter Boyle) states this when he talks to Bickle outside while they are at the diner. The themes and undertones of this movie is what really makes it something special. Not many films at the time were about alienation, depression, mental illness and anti-heroes. This was one of the first and still holds an impact to this day. The score by Bernard Herrmann captures the feeling and loneliness of New York City. In one part of the score, it has drums that build up suspense, almost like a horror film. Then all of a sudden, it transforms into a calm jazz song played by the saxophone. Variations of this one saxophone piece play throughout the movie. Another cool feature I've noticed, whether intentional or not is during the credits. The camera switches to Travis' point of view as he drives around the streets of New York, looking at many of the interesting sites and buildings around the city. The same slow jazz song plays, it is all quite relaxing. Around halfway through the credits, the music suddenly changes into the suspense part of the piece. Travis then switches his viewpoint from the buildings to people. He is not fixed after the end, he can still descend into the spiral of madness he fought so hard to get out of. He is still alienated and he is still sick. In conclusion, I award this masterpiece 10/10 Brilliant acting Brilliant themes / undertones Brilliant score Brilliant cinematography All in all, I memorable movie that stays with you long after first viewing.

    We are the taxi drivers. We let people in our hearts and minds. Some turn out to be rotten some inspire us. Either way they affect our thoughts and perceptions. Robert De Niro's created an unforgettable image of a taxi driver that longs to find the meaning of his life. No matter if it's a well mannered lady, under age prostitute, stranger willing to kill his own wife, or a presidential candidate. All these people come and go to the life of the taxi driver who is willing to change the system no matter what. Although he himself needs a cure he takes a bold step to become the cure for a young innocent child.

    i trust IMDb's top 250, it didn't disappoint me so far, and yes i am going to trust it in the future. dark knight series, groundhog days, departed, shutter island.. yeah they definitely deserve to be in top 250. but this? seriously? yes the acting of the cast is brilliant. De niro at his best. the idea is also good. but the problem arise when that good idea becomes a film. its completely miserable. predictable. a veteran, there he is driving cabs like a ordinary man, then he got violent and try to save a prostitute by killing people in cold blood (although they deserve it) and he is running free again... seriously? how the hell is he a free man after killing people in cold blood? (i don't know about the American law BTW) i am really confused here, i am giving 5 star rating because initially i really enjoyed the mysterious flow of the movie, and i thought there going to be a awesome twist like in departed or shutter island. but last 20 minutes or so i became really fed up with the movie since what i expected was not there. maybe there is a connection in the movie i don't understood which makes this movie a good movie. but not definitely a masterpiece. i know this review does not give you a better idea, but guys you have to watch it yourself to really understand. some will be agree with me, some not. everyone has different views right? I RESPECT that.

    Robert De Nero plays disturbed Vietnam veteran Travis Bickle, who is sickened by the decadence he sees in society, as he drives the night shift in a taxi for a living. He becomes fascinated by an attractive campaign worker(Cybill Shepherd) for a presidential candidate, though her friend(played by Albert Brooks) doesn't like him, she agrees to go on a date with him, much to her later regret. Travis also tries to a help a twelve year old prostitute(Jodie Foster, excellent) to escape her squalid life. Events take a violent turn when he confronts her pimp(Harvey Keitel), and after his unsuccessful attempt on the life of the politician, decides to take on the pimp instead.... De Nero is excellent portraying this sleep-deprived and morally confused man, and director Martin Scorsese effectively creates a hellish atmosphere for the New York streets, but this film is simply far too unpleasant and jarring to succeed. The final shootout and aftermath is so bizarre and ugly, not to mention unbelievable, that it torpedoes the positive aspects, and becomes a misfire, though it is highly acclaimed by some.

    De Niro plays You-talkinna-me Travis Bickle, a loner and a socially inept New York City cabby who takes the job because 'he cannot sleep at night'. As Travis sees more and more of the filth and depredation on the streets he tours, he turns to violence in an attempt to better the world. The movie is insufferably slow and repetitive while it channels the impressions Travis gets moonlighting the streets of New York. The dialog throughout the film feels unnatural and hammy and sucks the life out of an otherwise potentially interesting watch. There's also not much of a plot here which makes the 2 hour viewing quite a challenge. Foster is believable as the 12 year old hooker working for a pimp played by Keitel who sadly fails to convince due to the lackluster script. Cybill Shepherd makes a short and forgettable appearance as Travis his love interest and seems to be cast only for her pretty eyes and patented stare. Though wonderfully moody and well filmed, Taxi Driver is at its core an uninteresting character piece that goes on too long and tells us too little. The music score consists of variations on two jazzy reprises by Bernard Herrmann that are set on repeat throughout the film. When after an hour you hear it being played for the gazillionth time, it starts to become rather silly.

    Robert DeNiro delivered one of the iconic performances of all times. Travis Bickle has become one of the standard by which all performances are judged. Travis Bickle is a disturbed ex-Marine Vietnam vet. He's suffering from insomnia, and spends his nights driving a cab. He's sexually perverted, and obsessed with Betsy (Cybill Shepherd). On top of it all, he wants to save Iris (Jodie Foster) a 12 year old prostitute. Martin Scorsese is making a disturbing movie. It can be hard to watch at times. Scorsese uses his camera to maximum effect. As Bickle's mind drift from his co-workers, Scorsese's camera drift into the antacid fizzling in his glass. The grittiness of '70s NY is all there. Jodie Foster is shocking. Trying to watch Bickle can be a very trying experience. It isn't an easy movie. But it is a masterpiece.

De Nero is excellent portraying this sleep-deprived and morally confused man, and director Martin Scorsese effectively creates a hellish atmosphere for the New York streets, but this film is simply far too unpleasant and jarring to succeed. The final shootout and aftermath is so bizarre and ugly, not to mention unbelievable, that it torpedoes the positive aspects, and becomes a misfire, though it is highly acclaimed by some.

    De Niro plays You-talkinna-me Travis Bickle, a loner and a socially inept New York City cabby who takes the job because 'he cannot sleep at night'. As Travis sees more and more of the filth and depredation on the streets he tours, he turns to violence in an attempt to better the world. The movie is insufferably slow and repetitive while it channels the impressions Travis gets moonlighting the streets of New York. The dialog throughout the film feels unnatural and hammy and sucks the life out of an otherwise potentially interesting watch. There's also not much of a plot here which makes the 2 hour viewing quite a challenge. Foster is believable as the 12 year old hooker working for a pimp played by Keitel who sadly fails to convince due to the lackluster script. Cybill Shepherd makes a short and forgettable appearance as Travis his love interest and seems to be cast only for her pretty eyes and patented stare. Though wonderfully moody and well filmed, Taxi Driver is at its core an uninteresting character piece that goes on too long and tells us too little. The music score consists of variations on two jazzy reprises by Bernard Herrmann that are set on repeat throughout the film. When after an hour you hear it being played for the gazillionth time, it starts to become rather silly.

    Robert DeNiro delivered one of the iconic performances of all times. Travis Bickle has become one of the standard by which all performances are judged. Travis Bickle is a disturbed ex-Marine Vietnam vet. He's suffering from insomnia, and spends his nights driving a cab. He's sexually perverted, and obsessed with Betsy (Cybill Shepherd). On top of it all, he wants to save Iris (Jodie Foster) a 12 year old prostitute. Martin Scorsese is making a disturbing movie. It can be hard to watch at times. Scorsese uses his camera to maximum effect. As Bickle's mind drift from his co-workers, Scorsese's camera drift into the antacid fizzling in his glass. The grittiness of '70s NY is all there. Jodie Foster is shocking. Trying to watch Bickle can be a very trying experience. It isn't an easy movie. But it is a masterpiece.

    I watched 'Taxi driver' only recently after I saw how highly rated it was on here. Although the film was enjoyable I have to say I am a little disappointed. The setting was good and the plot also, the dramatic music throughout really made the tension build up. Robert De Niro is a fantastic actor and again he showed this as the taxi driver. I just felt like this could have been so much more, it seemed to take ages to get to the point where you just knew what was going to happen and when it got there it only lasted a few minutes. The action scenes just didn't do it for me. Of course this film is extremely old now and film making has come a long way so maybe that's why I didn't appreciate it as much as others did. It was worth a one time watch but for me I wouldn't regard this as a classic. 7/10.

    Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro, have made eight films together, most are considered to be some of the greatest movies of all time (one of them being Goodfellas (1990) another movie that I've reviewed). And today I'm writing my review for another one of their collaborations, Taxi Driver (1976). A movie about a Viet Nam vet, who takes a job as a nighttime cab driver, and eventually loneliness makes him what to do something violent. Now I normally don't put this up for older movies but I must say SPOILERS, because I will probably be giving away major plot points. Robert De Niro plays our main protagonist, Travis Bickle. De Niro's performance as Travis is the best I've ever seen in a movie, he's able to be a very relatable person with a hint of insanity in him, to the second half of the movie being psychotic, but somehow still likable The rest of the cast did pretty good. Jodie Foster's performance as Iris was good especially considering she was only 14 at the time. I loved the way the movie was able to show nighttime New York. It made it seem very reasonable why Travis hates the scum in the city. The music in the movie, was just a glorious thing to hear, it was mostly the saxophone and it fit the way New York's atmosphere was set up really well. The way the camera moves and catches whats happening, the angles and all are another reason why this is a great one. Palentine is the fictional senator in this movie that Betsy, the girl Travis is trying to date, works for. Betsy is at first a very likable character, but as Travis starts to dislike her so does the audience, a very good feat in the movie. The part when Travis's psychology takes a turn is when he takes a passenger to watch his wife silhouette in another man's apartment. Its a very disturbing and unsettling scene in the movie, but it's also one of the most important moments, because you can tell from the way the passenger is talking about killing his wife with a 44. Magnum and how Travis reacts and looks, that the passenger had given him an idea. This is when the loneliness starts to turn to violence. After that Travis starts to build himself an arsenal. A very good scene is when Travis is buying guns from easy Andy, it's great because of the way it's all played out. Another great thing about the movie is how you slowly start to see what Travis's plan is . Until it's revealed that he's going to kill Palentine, the buildup to the assassination is extremely suspenseful, all the tension rises until, the assassination fails. Most people probably know that the climax of the movie is a shootout among Travis and pimps, and lowlifes to save Iris. It's a very violent and shocking part, for today's standards, I can only imagine what it was like in 76. The movie overall, was downright amazing, one of the best and favorites of the movies I've seen. It's strengths lies in it's excellent performance by Robert De Niro, the amazing directing from Martin Scorsese, the incredible writing from Paul Schrader, the music, everything that's set into motion makes this movie as great as it is, and it earns a 10 out of 10, one of 10 to get this high of a rating form me. Also be expecting more review of Martin Scorsese movies in the following weeks.

    A man who is a taxi driver hates people who are into drugs or prostitutes in the street. He is disgusted by them and takes to the extreme way to mend them. Also, he wants to show the existence of himself to everyone. This film is one of New Hollywood and an empty atmosphere prevails throughout the story. I like a series of films of New Hollywood because the story shows a unique sense of values or a view of the world and the main characters are antisocial, but they have their own idea and try to express themselves and insist on what they think even though it may be wrong. I think this film also tells us that what the right justice is as well as the importance of holding their own justice. It is a deep story. I recommend everyone, especially those who like New Hollywood to watch this film.

    Taxi Driver is among my list of favourite films of all time! The story follows lead character Travis Bickle, (Robert De Niro) an insomniac ex-marine who leads a lonely life. In order to make some more money, he decides to apply for a job working nights as a Taxi Driver. He attends dodgy porn theatres in the day and works long nights meeting all of New York's 'scum' as he calls them. Lots of shady characters litter the story along with a cameo from the director, Martin Scorsese in the back of his taxi cap. Travis' one desire is to be with the woman he sees so very often at the Charles Palantine building, Betsy (Cybill Shepard.) As the movie progresses, you feel an awful as you witness him reach out to people and constantly get rejected, both angering and saddening him. His mind slowly descends into madness and you get the feeling that he soon will be violently out-lashing against the society in general. He begins collecting guns and isolating himself from others; watching boring shows on television and obsessing about a twelve year old prostitute (Jodie Foster) he feels it is his duty to save. He shaves his head into the now iconic mohawk and goes on a gruesome killing spree, murdering several pimps and business men within the whore house. Travis is hailed as a hero which is an attempt to talk about society and the way in some cases, it will justify violence for the greater good. To me, Travis is not a hero but at the same time he isn't your average villain. The character is very carefully crafted, giving the illusion that he is just a lonely man that wants compassion just like everybody else. The problem is, many people can see a bit of themselves within him, as Scorsese has said himself, there are real life Travis' all over the world; he is not some made up character. Robert De Niro's portrayal of a madman slowly going insane, day by day is astounding and highly convincing. This is followed by some extremely strong leads, especially notable is Iris (Jodie Foster), Betsy (Cybill Shepard) and the pimp, Sport or Matthew (Harvey Keitel.) Along with a lot of improvising throughout the scenes, the actors and actresses hold their ground very well and all portray their characters as they would appear in real life. One constantly overlooked scene is in fact very significant. The scene I am talking about is the one where he brakes his television, right before, Travis is looking at a show on TV. It flashes images on couples dancing and having fun while the song 'Late For The Sky' by Jackson Browne plays. The television is actually depicting the life he can never have, on one side, teenagers and youth are out having fun and partying, living like a youthful person should. On the other side, you have a very disturbed man who is loading up on guns and ammunition, isolating himself from people and attempting to for-fill his 'final mission.' Even Wizard, Travis' friend (Peter Boyle) states this when he talks to Bickle outside while they are at the diner. The themes and undertones of this movie is what really makes it something special. Not many films at the time were about alienation, depression, mental illness and anti-heroes. This was one of the first and still holds an impact to this day. The score by Bernard Herrmann captures the feeling and loneliness of New York City. In one part of the score, it has drums that build up suspense, almost like a horror film. Then all of a sudden, it transforms into a calm jazz song played by the saxophone. Variations of this one saxophone piece play throughout the movie. Another cool feature I've noticed, whether intentional or not is during the credits. The camera switches to Travis' point of view as he drives around the streets of New York, looking at many of the interesting sites and buildings around the city. The same slow jazz song plays, it is all quite relaxing. Around halfway through the credits, the music suddenly changes into the suspense part of the piece. Travis then switches his viewpoint from the buildings to people. He is not fixed after the end, he can still descend into the spiral of madness he fought so hard to get out of. He is still alienated and he is still sick. In conclusion, I award this masterpiece 10/10 Brilliant acting Brilliant themes / undertones Brilliant score Brilliant cinematography All in all, I memorable movie that stays with you long after first viewing.

    We are the taxi drivers. We let people in our hearts and minds. Some turn out to be rotten some inspire us. Either way they affect our thoughts and perceptions. Robert De Niro's created an unforgettable image of a taxi driver that longs to find the meaning of his life. No matter if it's a well mannered lady, under age prostitute, stranger willing to kill his own wife, or a presidential candidate. All these people come and go to the life of the taxi driver who is willing to change the system no matter what. Although he himself needs a cure he takes a bold step to become the cure for a young innocent child.

    i trust IMDb's top 250, it didn't disappoint me so far, and yes i am going to trust it in the future. dark knight series, groundhog days, departed, shutter island.. yeah they definitely deserve to be in top 250. but this? seriously? yes the acting of the cast is brilliant. De niro at his best. the idea is also good. but the problem arise when that good idea becomes a film. its completely miserable. predictable. a veteran, there he is driving cabs like a ordinary man, then he got violent and try to save a prostitute by killing people in cold blood (although they deserve it) and he is running free again... seriously? how the hell is he a free man after killing people in cold blood? (i don't know about the American law BTW) i am really confused here, i am giving 5 star rating because initially i really enjoyed the mysterious flow of the movie, and i thought there going to be a awesome twist like in departed or shutter island. but last 20 minutes or so i became really fed up with the movie since what i expected was not there. maybe there is a connection in the movie i don't understood which makes this movie a good movie. but not definitely a masterpiece. i know this review does not give you a better idea, but guys you have to watch it yourself to really understand. some will be agree with me, some not. everyone has different views right? I RESPECT that.

    Robert De Nero plays disturbed Vietnam veteran Travis Bickle, who is sickened by the decadence he sees in society, as he drives the night shift in a taxi for a living. He becomes fascinated by an attractive campaign worker(Cybill Shepherd) for a presidential candidate, though her friend(played by Albert Brooks) doesn't like him, she agrees to go on a date with him, much to her later regret. Travis also tries to a help a twelve year old prostitute(Jodie Foster, excellent) to escape her squalid life. Events take a violent turn when he confronts her pimp(Harvey Keitel), and after his unsuccessful attempt on the life of the politician, decides to take on the pimp instead.... De Nero is excellent portraying this sleep-deprived and morally confused man, and director Martin Scorsese effectively creates a hellish atmosphere for the New York streets, but this film is simply far too unpleasant and jarring to succeed. The final shootout and aftermath is so bizarre and ugly, not to mention unbelievable, that it torpedoes the positive aspects, and becomes a misfire, though it is highly acclaimed by some.

    i trust IMDb's top 250, it didn't disappoint me so far, and yes i am going to trust it in the future. dark knight series, groundhog days, departed, shutter island.. yeah they definitely deserve to be in top 250. but this? seriously? yes the acting of the cast is brilliant. De niro at his best. the idea is also good. but the problem arise when that good idea becomes a film. its completely miserable. predictable. a veteran, there he is driving cabs like a ordinary man, then he got violent and try to save a prostitute by killing people in cold blood (although they deserve it) and he is running free again... seriously? how the hell is he a free man after killing people in cold blood? (i don't know about the American law BTW) i am really confused here, i am giving 5 star rating because initially i really enjoyed the mysterious flow of the movie, and i thought there going to be a awesome twist like in departed or shutter island. but last 20 minutes or so i became really fed up with the movie since what i expected was not there. maybe there is a connection in the movie i don't understood which makes this movie a good movie. but not definitely a masterpiece. i know this review does not give you a better idea, but guys you have to watch it yourself to really understand. some will be agree with me, some not. everyone has different views right? I RESPECT that.

    Robert De Nero plays disturbed Vietnam veteran Travis Bickle, who is sickened by the decadence he sees in society, as he drives the night shift in a taxi for a living. He becomes fascinated by an attractive campaign worker(Cybill Shepherd) for a presidential candidate, though her friend(played by Albert Brooks) doesn't like him, she agrees to go on a date with him, much to her later regret. Travis also tries to a help a twelve year old prostitute(Jodie Foster, excellent) to escape her squalid life. Events take a violent turn when he confronts her pimp(Harvey Keitel), and after his unsuccessful attempt on the life of the politician, decides to take on the pimp instead.... De Nero is excellent portraying this sleep-deprived and morally confused man, and director Martin Scorsese effectively creates a hellish atmosphere for the New York streets, but this film is simply far too unpleasant and jarring to succeed. The final shootout and aftermath is so bizarre and ugly, not to mention unbelievable, that it torpedoes the positive aspects, and becomes a misfire, though it is highly acclaimed by some.

    De Niro plays You-talkinna-me Travis Bickle, a loner and a socially inept New York City cabby who takes the job because 'he cannot sleep at night'. As Travis sees more and more of the filth and depredation on the streets he tours, he turns to violence in an attempt to better the world. The movie is insufferably slow and repetitive while it channels the impressions Travis gets moonlighting the streets of New York. The dialog throughout the film feels unnatural and hammy and sucks the life out of an otherwise potentially interesting watch. There's also not much of a plot here which makes the 2 hour viewing quite a challenge. Foster is believable as the 12 year old hooker working for a pimp played by Keitel who sadly fails to convince due to the lackluster script. Cybill Shepherd makes a short and forgettable appearance as Travis his love interest and seems to be cast only for her pretty eyes and patented stare. Though wonderfully moody and well filmed, Taxi Driver is at its core an uninteresting character piece that goes on too long and tells us too little. The music score consists of variations on two jazzy reprises by Bernard Herrmann that are set on repeat throughout the film. When after an hour you hear it being played for the gazillionth time, it starts to become rather silly.

    Robert DeNiro delivered one of the iconic performances of all times. Travis Bickle has become one of the standard by which all performances are judged. Travis Bickle is a disturbed ex-Marine Vietnam vet. He's suffering from insomnia, and spends his nights driving a cab. He's sexually perverted, and obsessed with Betsy (Cybill Shepherd). On top of it all, he wants to save Iris (Jodie Foster) a 12 year old prostitute. Martin Scorsese is making a disturbing movie. It can be hard to watch at times. Scorsese uses his camera to maximum effect. As Bickle's mind drift from his co-workers, Scorsese's camera drift into the antacid fizzling in his glass. The grittiness of '70s NY is all there. Jodie Foster is shocking. Trying to watch Bickle can be a very trying experience. It isn't an easy movie. But it is a masterpiece.

    I watched 'Taxi driver' only recently after I saw how highly rated it was on here. Although the film was enjoyable I have to say I am a little disappointed. The setting was good and the plot also, the dramatic music throughout really made the tension build up. Robert De Niro is a fantastic actor and again he showed this as the taxi driver. I just felt like this could have been so much more, it seemed to take ages to get to the point where you just knew what was going to happen and when it got there it only lasted a few minutes. The action scenes just didn't do it for me. Of course this film is extremely old now and film making has come a long way so maybe that's why I didn't appreciate it as much as others did. It was worth a one time watch but for me I wouldn't regard this as a classic. 7/10.

    Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro, have made eight films together, most are considered to be some of the greatest movies of all time (one of them being Goodfellas (1990) another movie that I've reviewed). And today I'm writing my review for another one of their collaborations, Taxi Driver (1976). A movie about a Viet Nam vet, who takes a job as a nighttime cab driver, and eventually loneliness makes him what to do something violent. Now I normally don't put this up for older movies but I must say SPOILERS, because I will probably be giving away major plot points. Robert De Niro plays our main protagonist, Travis Bickle. De Niro's performance as Travis is the best I've ever seen in a movie, he's able to be a very relatable person with a hint of insanity in him, to the second half of the movie being psychotic, but somehow still likable The rest of the cast did pretty good. Jodie Foster's performance as Iris was good especially considering she was only 14 at the time. I loved the way the movie was able to show nighttime New York. It made it seem very reasonable why Travis hates the scum in the city. The music in the movie, was just a glorious thing to hear, it was mostly the saxophone and it fit the way New York's atmosphere was set up really well. The way the camera moves and catches whats happening, the angles and all are another reason why this is a great one. Palentine is the fictional senator in this movie that Betsy, the girl Travis is trying to date, works for. Betsy is at first a very likable character, but as Travis starts to dislike her so does the audience, a very good feat in the movie. The part when Travis's psychology takes a turn is when he takes a passenger to watch his wife silhouette in another man's apartment. Its a very disturbing and unsettling scene in the movie, but it's also one of the most important moments, because you can tell from the way the passenger is talking about killing his wife with a 44. Magnum and how Travis reacts and looks, that the passenger had given him an idea. This is when the loneliness starts to turn to violence. After that Travis starts to build himself an arsenal. A very good scene is when Travis is buying guns from easy Andy, it's great because of the way it's all played out. Another great thing about the movie is how you slowly start to see what Travis's plan is . Until it's revealed that he's going to kill Palentine, the buildup to the assassination is extremely suspenseful, all the tension rises until, the assassination fails. Most people probably know that the climax of the movie is a shootout among Travis and pimps, and lowlifes to save Iris. It's a very violent and shocking part, for today's standards, I can only imagine what it was like in 76. The movie overall, was downright amazing, one of the best and favorites of the movies I've seen. It's strengths lies in it's excellent performance by Robert De Niro, the amazing directing from Martin Scorsese, the incredible writing from Paul Schrader, the music, everything that's set into motion makes this movie as great as it is, and it earns a 10 out of 10, one of 10 to get this high of a rating form me. Also be expecting more review of Martin Scorsese movies in the following weeks.

    A man who is a taxi driver hates people who are into drugs or prostitutes in the street. He is disgusted by them and takes to the extreme way to mend them. Also, he wants to show the existence of himself to everyone. This film is one of New Hollywood and an empty atmosphere prevails throughout the story. I like a series of films of New Hollywood because the story shows a unique sense of values or a view of the world and the main characters are antisocial, but they have their own idea and try to express themselves and insist on what they think even though it may be wrong. I think this film also tells us that what the right justice is as well as the importance of holding their own justice. It is a deep story. I recommend everyone, especially those who like New Hollywood to watch this film.

    Taxi Driver is among my list of favourite films of all time! The story follows lead character Travis Bickle, (Robert De Niro) an insomniac ex-marine who leads a lonely life. In order to make some more money, he decides to apply for a job working nights as a Taxi Driver. He attends dodgy porn theatres in the day and works long nights meeting all of New York's 'scum' as he calls them. Lots of shady characters litter the story along with a cameo from the director, Martin Scorsese in the back of his taxi cap. Travis' one desire is to be with the woman he sees so very often at the Charles Palantine building, Betsy (Cybill Shepard.) As the movie progresses, you feel an awful as you witness him reach out to people and constantly get rejected, both angering and saddening him. His mind slowly descends into madness and you get the feeling that he soon will be violently out-lashing against the society in general. He begins collecting guns and isolating himself from others; watching boring shows on television and obsessing about a twelve year old prostitute (Jodie Foster) he feels it is his duty to save. He shaves his head into the now iconic mohawk and goes on a gruesome killing spree, murdering several pimps and business men within the whore house. Travis is hailed as a hero which is an attempt to talk about society and the way in some cases, it will justify violence for the greater good. To me, Travis is not a hero but at the same time he isn't your average villain. The character is very carefully crafted, giving the illusion that he is just a lonely man that wants compassion just like everybody else. The problem is, many people can see a bit of themselves within him, as Scorsese has said himself, there are real life Travis' all over the world; he is not some made up character. Robert De Niro's portrayal of a madman slowly going insane, day by day is astounding and highly convincing. This is followed by some extremely strong leads, especially notable is Iris (Jodie Foster), Betsy (Cybill Shepard) and the pimp, Sport or Matthew (Harvey Keitel.) Along with a lot of improvising throughout the scenes, the actors and actresses hold their ground very well and all portray their characters as they would appear in real life. One constantly overlooked scene is in fact very significant. The scene I am talking about is the one where he brakes his television, right before, Travis is looking at a show on TV. It flashes images on couples dancing and having fun while the song 'Late For The Sky' by Jackson Browne plays. The television is actually depicting the life he can never have, on one side, teenagers and youth are out having fun and partying, living like a youthful person should. On the other side, you have a very disturbed man who is loading up on guns and ammunition, isolating himself from people and attempting to for-fill his 'final mission.' Even Wizard, Travis' friend (Peter Boyle) states this when he talks to Bickle outside while they are at the diner. The themes and undertones of this movie is what really makes it something special. Not many films at the time were about alienation, depression, mental illness and anti-heroes. This was one of the first and still holds an impact to this day. The score by Bernard Herrmann captures the feeling and loneliness of New York City. In one part of the score, it has drums that build up suspense, almost like a horror film. Then all of a sudden, it transforms into a calm jazz song played by the saxophone. Variations of this one saxophone piece play throughout the movie. Another cool feature I've noticed, whether intentional or not is during the credits. The camera switches to Travis' point of view as he drives around the streets of New York, looking at many of the interesting sites and buildings around the city. The same slow jazz song plays, it is all quite relaxing. Around halfway through the credits, the music suddenly changes into the suspense part of the piece. Travis then switches his viewpoint from the buildings to people. He is not fixed after the end, he can still descend into the spiral of madness he fought so hard to get out of. He is still alienated and he is still sick. In conclusion, I award this masterpiece 10/10 Brilliant acting Brilliant themes / undertones Brilliant score Brilliant cinematography All in all, I memorable movie that stays with you long after first viewing.

    We are the taxi drivers. We let people in our hearts and minds. Some turn out to be rotten some inspire us. Either way they affect our thoughts and perceptions. Robert De Niro's created an unforgettable image of a taxi driver that longs to find the meaning of his life. No matter if it's a well mannered lady, under age prostitute, stranger willing to kill his own wife, or a presidential candidate. All these people come and go to the life of the taxi driver who is willing to change the system no matter what. Although he himself needs a cure he takes a bold step to become the cure for a young innocent child.
