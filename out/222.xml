 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  The time is the 24th century and the ship is the newly-commissioned Enterprise-E. Its captain, Jean-Luc Picard, has been ordered not to interfere in a battle between a Borg Cube and ships from the Federation. However, seeing the Federation is about to lose, Picard ignore his orders and takes command of the defending fleet. With his knowledge of the Cube's weak spot, they destroy it. However, a small part of it escapes and plots a course directly for Earth. The Enterprise chases it and enters a time distortion created by the Borg. They end up in the mid-21st century, and their only chance of stopping the Borg from assimilating Earth is to help Zefram Cochrane make his famous first faster-than-light travel to the stars.

    People act like the Star Trek Reboot and its sequel are the only times Star Trek has veered into the genre of straight up action: Those people however seem to forget about this installment. Star Trek: First Contact's plot is that Captain Picard and the crew of the Enterprise must stop the Borg from altering history. Now, I'm going to let you know right off the bat that the plot is the weakest part.Despite it being well told, it contains numerous plot holes that are kind of hard not to notice. And yet, that is overshadowed by the great acting, smart dialogue, terrific special effects, and phenomenal action scenes. First Contact is also one of the darkest of the Star Trek films, and it works well as the pacing picks up and the film gets more and more intense to the point where you are on the edge of your seat. First Contact stands as the ONLY good Next Generation film, and it is even better than Wrath of Khan.

    Star Trek: First Contact is a great movie with a really well developed storyline that will both fans of Star Trek: The Next Generation and fans of sci-fi in general.It is the first standalone movie for the Next Generation crew,and it is much better than their first movie,Generations,that crossed them over with a few members of the original Star Trek crew,it was much better seeing this crew on their own instead of throwing in William Shatner.Like all Star Treks,the cast is fantastic,but there was just something extra special about this one,them seemed much ore positive than usual,they clearly knew it was a great script.Fans of Star Trek and just fans of sci-fi,because it has enough in it not to confuse people who aren't aware of Star Trek,will be very pleased with First Contact. Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) must battle against his old enemy the Borg,as they try to change history for the worse.

    I would say that this is the last great Trek film which resembles Gene Roddenberry's vision of the series. All the magic ingredients are there, the sense of family and interaction between the crew, the jeopardy, the message and even the ship, all come together to give us what Star Trek was all about in just under two hours. Special efx are great, Alice Krige as the Borg Queen somehow manages to be sexy and creepy at the same time, there is a wonderful scene between her and Data which also somehow manages to be highly erotic though the only flesh on show is Data's wrist.......... For me, I find it both sad and astonishing to see how quickly Star Trek burnt out with the next film, perhaps less could have been more and the franchise should have been rested after this last great film? What came next lost the magic and even JJ Abrams' offerings are Flatland 2D efforts in Roddenberry's 3D Trek universe; flat cardboard and wafer-thin plots with no substance, plot, message or wonder whatsoever.

    Star Trek: First Contact **1/2 (out of 4) 111 mins/ 12 Cast: Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, LeVar Burton, Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden, Marina Sirtis, Alfre Woodard, James Cromwell, Alice Krige, Neal McDonough Director: Jonathan Frakes Plot: The Enterprise D crew has to travel in time to face off against the evil Borg, who go way back with Captain Picard, as they try to prevent Earth's first contact with extra-terrestrial life. JJ's Verdict: Star Trek: First Contact starts off bold and proud with the theme tune playing over some well-made credits. With its reputation as the best Trek of them all, after reading the plot, you would expect bold and proud action that has a meaning to save the world. However, although we do get good action, it never seems through the camera or the characters eyes that they are fighting to save the universe and ends up just being about Picard fighting his demons and defeating the Borg for a personal achievement. In First Contact, the Enterprise crew are forced to time travel back to the mid-21st century as the Borg try to stop humans having first contact with aliens. We then find out that Captain Picard is dealing with demons once again because he was once taken in and transformed to become one of them. From here we get two groups of characters. The first are Riker and Geordi on Earth trying to make sure Zefram Cochran to fulfil his destiny and make first contact with aliens. Zefram is a cynical drunkard who is not too dissimilar to the character Dr. McCoy who was so loved by Trek fans back with the original crew. James Cromwell, portraying Cochran, brings a much needed freshness and quirkiness to the picture and gives us a very likable character. Back on the Enterprise we have an 'Alien' style survival against the Borg lead by Picard and Worf. Patrick Stewart, who of course plays Picard, once again brings his cool, commanding and cooling presence to the screen and if the state of the world really did depend on him, I'd be very happy indeed. All of these scenes have some great action and well-made chases but given its source material, feels a long way from the more human elements of the Original Crew's tenure. Sure, I love good action but it just doesn't feel like a 'Trek' film to me. Despite this, one scene at the start in which Picard disobeys orders from Starfleet is almost identical to one in Kirk and Co.'s final outing back in 1991 and feels awfully cringing. Another problem with the 'Alien' like scenes, are the aliens themselves, the Borg. Although Alice Krige puts in a creditable performance as the Borg, it is the Borg's motives which had me confused. To have power of the world, they are trying to stop human's first contact with aliens but surely, even if they stopped it then, there will be more opportunities to contact aliens. More Borg problems are that despite inhabiting their ship, the Borg will only kill the crew if they see them as a threat, and the crew will only kill the Borg if the Borg see the crew as a threat. Even when they are standing metres away form each other, they will only shoot if they sense that they are in danger. Why? I, unfortunately, cannot answer. The films visuals are the best out of all previous Trek films and so are the big-scoped space battles. More positives in the film are the dry wit in the script and great mix of seriousness and comic relief. However, this does have its downside because as the danger to Picard gets more serious, the comic relief given by James Cromwell increases which causes for a great sense of awkwardness as the two cut from one to another. Despite not being a 'Trek' film in the sense of the word, First Contact gives us an entertaining last twenty minutes, to be a decent but certainly watchable film.

    Star Trek: First Contact is widely considered to be 'The Wrath of Khan' of the New Generations films and rightly so. This film is a truly great film and to consider how it bounced back after 'Star Trek: Generations' is beyond me. Immediately into the film, we are told that Captain Picard, played by Patrick Stewart, was once assimilated by the Borg. News then breaks that a new Borg is prepared to attack Earth and the crew decide to disobey the orders of the Enterprise, with the android Data saying "To hell with our orders!" and so the Enterprise decide to help out a fleet that is attacked by the Borg. After the battle comes to an abrupt end, the Enterprise realize that the Borg has indeed used time travel to arrive at the day before aliens make first contact with Earth and must travel back in time to stop this from happening, which involves getting the creator of the Warp drive to activate it. I was extremely hesitant and afraid to watch this film, realizing how bad 'Generations' was. I could not take the pain of watching another bad Trek film, even when critics had stated it to be one of the best, I did not believe it! Thankfully, this is indeed one of the best and I personally rank it the second best. This opinion is subject to change once I do get to see JJ Abram's 2009 reboot but Star Trek: First Contact is an extremely interesting film with a far better written characters and story. Think back to 'Generations' when then android Data was simply making horrible jokes about an emotion chip that helps him understand jokes that were said years ago. Here, he is a far more interesting character and despite a few corny moments, Data is one of the highlights of the film. Take a look back at the villain in 'Generations' whose goal was to somehow travel back into the Nexus. Here, the villain is the Borg, possibly the coolest villain. First Contact also has the best action sequences in the series, up to date, and with a budget of $48 million, the film included great set pieces, possibly the best special effects up til now and was a commercial success, considering it made approximately 3 times its overall budget in the Box Office. The 'Star Trek' franchise suffers from often poor special effects, often tedious moments and corny dialogue that are only very limited in 'Wrath of Khan' and 'First Contact' The Borg were extremely interesting and intense villains and the Klingon Worf was extremely well done in the film. All the characters that were laughable in the previous entry to the Trek franchise have been re-done in a far more interesting way. The story itself is the best of the franchise and the visual effects and set piece have never looked better. A scene that stands out when referring to great set pieces for its time is the scene where Picard, Worf and the other officer are standing atop the Enterprise and attempting to thwart the plans of the Borg. Something interesting about this film is the direction they took with Data, whose motivations were clear: to be more human despite being a mechanical android. I love how the Borg gave him human skin and tried making him more human. That stuff worked very well in the film and gave another dimension to Data- something which 'Generations' utterly failed at. 'Star Trek: First Contact' is most definitely superior to 'Generations' and is the true introduction to the New Generations series. An extremely interesting premise is backed up by fantastic writing and directing, great action sequences and fantastic special effects. Quite possibly the best Trek film, along with 'Wrath of Khan' and a true surprise. Overall, this is one of the great Sci-Fi films.

    My wife and I watched the last 40 minutes of this movie on TV last night. She works for a production company that worked on "Into Darkness," and she had never seen any of the older Star Trek movies. I had seen "First Contact" when it came out in theaters, and I remembered that I really enjoyed it. At first I figured, "Well, I was a kid, and everything that involved space ships and lasers and explosions was cool back then." Boy, was I wrong. "First Contact" is not simply a sci-fi movie. In many ways, it is a movie about accepting responsibility and going the extra mile to do the right thing. Whether it's Picard refusing to abandon ship, or Data struggling to reject becoming a human (something he's always wanted), or Cochrane struggling to muster up the balls to test his FTL ship. Does it help to be a Star Trek fan? No, not really. It's not like they blindly reference old episodes from the show without any explanation - everything that happens is explained and easy to understand. Still, unlike JJ Abrams, this movie isn't dumbed down to encourage non-fans to give it a shot. I was surprised to find myself emotionally invested in the ending, especially after only tuning in over half-way through and having to explain several plot points to my wife (amazingly, I remembered MUCH more than I thought). And here's the crazy part, folks: you know how you can be flipping through the channels, come across a show or movie you haven't seen in a long time, it keeps your interest until the first commercial break, and then you change the channel? That didn't happen. My wife and I watched the whole damn thing - it kept our attention the entire time. And when a movie can do that, you know it's worth watching. I highly recommend this movie. I'll go so far as to say I think it's better than "Wrath of Khan." Yeah, I said it!

    In my opinion, this movie was pretty good. I love the analysis of Captain Jean Luc Picard's (Patrick Stewart) quest for revenge against the Borg being similar to Herman Melville's Moby Dick character Ahab whom in the book wanted revenge on a White Whale that took his leg. Six years ago, he was assimilation by the cybernetic Borg, and barely escape from it as shown in Star Trek: The Next Generation episode 'The Best of Both Worlds'. It's weird how there is two types of Picards. Picard here in the movie is like James T. Kirk, who acts in violence, disobey orders, and have pointless action scenes. In the TV series, Picard is a intelligent, mostly non-violence person who doesn't act upon violence unless it's a last resort. In the TV series, Picard was even nice to the Borgs choosing not to wipe them out when he had the chance because he believe that Borgs have the right to live. This belief happen after 'The Best of Both Worlds' episodes. Here in the movie, Picard is like I want to kill them all. Love the Holograph rampage that become a Internet meme later on. It's weird in a way, that the Federation was trying to stop Captain Jean Luc Picard from joining the Borg battle due to that reason. Despite him, knowing more about the enemy than anybody else in the Federation. I thought they would use him.In the past, at less in the Next Generation episodes, Picard was allowed to take control of three ships to kill the Borgs when they were trying to destroy a few space colonies. Anyways, Picard didn't follow the orders and join the fight against the Borgs in the beginning of the movie. Don't feel bad, Picard; the cast of Deep Space Nine wasn't invited despite USS Defiant being there. At less, the doctor from USS Voyager had a cameo in the film which was kinda funny. The Borgs were attacking Earth so they can assimilation them, but this is where the plot get confusing. The Borgs assimilates some, but allow others to live, because they don't find them a threat. By others- I meant people with guns.The writers of the movie wanted a story involving the Borgs, but the producer wanted a story involving time travel. The writers combined the two ideas; they initially set the film during the European Renaissance, but changed the time period the Borg corrupted to the mid-21st century after fearing the Renaissance idea would be too much like a bathetic novel. It would had been campy and over the top. Plus, Picard in tights wouldn't be a pretty sight. The entire plot doesn't make much sense, anyways. Rather than going to a remote part of space and time travel to Earth which would be safer for their Cube ship. They go near 24th century Earth where they were attack by hundreds of space ships. The cube ship is no shock destroy, as a Borg sphere ship escapes back into time in a worm hole which the USS Enterprise follows. The Enterprise arrives in the past, on April 4, 2063, the day before humanity's first contact with alien life after Zefram Cochrane's (James Cromwell) historic warp drive flight. James Cromwell was great and funny in the role. It's so unlike most of his serious dull roles that mostly follow his career. Still, it was a bit weird to see him play Cochrane and yet play other bit characters in the TV series such in the episodes 'The Hunted' and 'The Birth Right'. I just can't like Cochrane's assistant Lily Sloane (Alfre Woodard) because she always just in the way, and brings nothing to the table. Anyways the plot goes from assimilation them to now stopping first contact, which doesn't make any sense. If the humans never went to space the Borg would have never heard of them, so they wouldn't know they existed, so in a way, there would be erasing their history as well since there was no need to go to the Planet Earth. Plus, why are they assimilating them anyways? The Borg aren't primarily interested in humanity, a lesser species with unimpressive technology. They're making it seem that way, to attract the attention of the being they really want to assimilate says Q. Honestly, John de Lancie's omnipotent character Q was indeed in one of the first drafts of the screenplay. Anyways, the Borg Queen (Alice Krige) is probably my second favorite Star Trek villain besides Khan. She was pure evil. Alice was such a trooper. Krige suffered a large amount of discomfort filming her role; her costume was too tight, causing blisters, and the painful silver contact lenses she wore could only be kept in for four minutes at a time. Love the make up on her. The Borg were redesigned to appear as though they were converted into machine beings from the inside-out; the new makeup sessions took four times as long as on the television series. The supporting cast of the crew did what they can. Nothing worth saying about their acting. Commander Worf's (Michael Dorn) head still looks like a fanny. The special effect are great, surprising in the fact that Industrial Light & Magic rushed through it to complete the film's special effects in less than five months before the release date. The music is amazing, and yet another great job by Jerry Goldsmith. Love hearing Stepphenwolf 'Magic Carpet Ride" in the film. Director and cast member Jonathan Frakes AKA William Riker did a good job with his first film. Despite the sloppy writing and vague assumptions. I will admit the plot is full of holes, but I still really like this movie. There's a few inconsistencies, but they're forgivable with how great the action is. I know the Time Travel thing is a pretty bland idea, but overall this was quite an enjoyable film.

    The quintessential example of how a Star Trek movie should be done; (1) TNG cast are awesome (as usual), (2) The Enterprise has a new make over, (3) Beverley Crusher looking hotter than ever, (4) Great battle scenes, (5) Awesome new weapon with a cool name - Quantum torpedo, (6) The Borg - the best ST protagonist ever, (7) Witty dialogue and excellent character interactions (8) Troi was even decent !!! (9) The Borg Queen was fantastically portrayed (10) A truly awesome musical score.... .... what more is there to say? all but perfect! (The review is so concise and succinct that I have to add this to meet the minimum line requirements :P)

    The first movie spin-off from the Star Trek: Next Generation franchise felt like simply an extended double episode that was made for the big screen, and in a way I got the same impression with this film as well, even though I did enjoy it and enjoyed it somewhat the second time around. I have just finished watching all of the Deep Space 9 episodes and during that time I have been checking up a lot about the Star Trek universe on wikipedia, so when I read the entry for this movie I had a desire to watch it again. First Contact does come across like an extended episode, though no doubt it was more expensive that a simple episode. The crew returns with a new Enterprise (and new uniforms, which transfer over to Deep Space 9 at about the same time in the series). I am not sure where the other movies slip in though considering they seem to have been placed during the Dominion War. I do find it strange that we never see the new Enterprise E appearing in any of the later Deep Space 9 episodes, or even Picard making an appearance, considering that Starfleet's flagship would most likely be fighting on the front lines of what was quite a devastating war. The Borg have attacked Earth again, but the typical bureaucracy of Starfleet pushes Picard out to the Romulan Neutral Zone in case his previous encounters with the Borg may prove problematic to the defense of Earth. However, as is expected, Picard disobeys orders and returns to Earth just in time to destroy the ship. However it is not all over immediately as an escape pod is ejected and begins to travel back in time to the mid-21st century, and Picard orders his crew to follow it. This is where the title of the film comes in because they arrive a couple of days before Earth makes first contact with the Vulcans. Once again they destroy the borg ship, but not before it severely damages the first warp drive ship being built, and also not before them manage to transport onto the Enterprise and begin to assimilate the crew. As such there are two plots running concurrently. On Earth the away crew, led by Riker and La Forge are racing against time to get the ship launched on schedule, and also attempt to convince an alcoholic Zephram Cochraine to go ahead with his warp drive test to alert the Vulcans to their presence. The second plot has the crew of the Enterprise, led by Picard, attempting to deal with the borg and to stop them from alerting other borg of their presences and the presence of Earth. After watching the entire season of Deep Space 9 I have come to really appreciate the Star Trek universe and some of the races that appear therein. Of course I always balk at this idea of a perfect, cashless, religionless, society where humans are always trying to better themselves. It just seems to be to be an unrealistic utopia that could never come about. Further, the whole idea that humans do not engage in conflict anymore seems to be silly, particularly when there is conflict within the episodes. Obviously the idea is to write off such humans as bad influences (such as the Marquis) and consider them destructive to the Federation. I did quite enjoy this movie, though it is one of those movies that you do need some familiarity with the series to at least understand the characters. When the film opens it is automatically assumed that the audience knows who the characters are, there is really no introduction. As such to viewer who is not familiar with the Star Trek franchise, it can be a little confusion. Personally, having watched Star Trek in the past and being familiar with many of the characters that make an appearance, the problem is not really so great for me, and it is also difficult to see it from an alternate point of view. What was also a little disappointing was that the only character that came back from Deep Space 9 for the movie was Worf, and I noted that the crew of the Defiant were pretty much nameless crew members. It would have been good to have at least seen Dax in the episode, or maybe some of the other characters, but I suspect that bringing characters across from Deep Space 9 may have added some more awkwardness to the movie that is not needed. In a way it sort of come across as part horror movie, as far as Star Trek can go with the horror genre. I suspect that is what they were trying to do with the Borg invasion of the Enterprise. First we have them scooting around the ventilation ducts as if it were an Alien movie, then we have the Borg Queen grafting skin onto Data to give him the sensation of humanity. In some horror films the concept of flesh plays a significant role, however in this film it is simply the representation of Data's desire to become more human. In the end he does sacrifice his new found skin, and sensation, to save the lives of his friends.

    People act like the Star Trek Reboot and its sequel are the only times Star Trek has veered into the genre of straight up action: Those people however seem to forget about this installment. Star Trek: First Contact's plot is that Captain Picard and the crew of the Enterprise must stop the Borg from altering history. Now, I'm going to let you know right off the bat that the plot is the weakest part.Despite it being well told, it contains numerous plot holes that are kind of hard not to notice. And yet, that is overshadowed by the great acting, smart dialogue, terrific special effects, and phenomenal action scenes. First Contact is also one of the darkest of the Star Trek films, and it works well as the pacing picks up and the film gets more and more intense to the point where you are on the edge of your seat. First Contact stands as the ONLY good Next Generation film, and it is even better than Wrath of Khan.

    Star Trek: First Contact is a great movie with a really well developed storyline that will both fans of Star Trek: The Next Generation and fans of sci-fi in general.It is the first standalone movie for the Next Generation crew,and it is much better than their first movie,Generations,that crossed them over with a few members of the original Star Trek crew,it was much better seeing this crew on their own instead of throwing in William Shatner.Like all Star Treks,the cast is fantastic,but there was just something extra special about this one,them seemed much ore positive than usual,they clearly knew it was a great script.Fans of Star Trek and just fans of sci-fi,because it has enough in it not to confuse people who aren't aware of Star Trek,will be very pleased with First Contact. Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) must battle against his old enemy the Borg,as they try to change history for the worse.

    I would say that this is the last great Trek film which resembles Gene Roddenberry's vision of the series. All the magic ingredients are there, the sense of family and interaction between the crew, the jeopardy, the message and even the ship, all come together to give us what Star Trek was all about in just under two hours. Special efx are great, Alice Krige as the Borg Queen somehow manages to be sexy and creepy at the same time, there is a wonderful scene between her and Data which also somehow manages to be highly erotic though the only flesh on show is Data's wrist.......... For me, I find it both sad and astonishing to see how quickly Star Trek burnt out with the next film, perhaps less could have been more and the franchise should have been rested after this last great film? What came next lost the magic and even JJ Abrams' offerings are Flatland 2D efforts in Roddenberry's 3D Trek universe; flat cardboard and wafer-thin plots with no substance, plot, message or wonder whatsoever.

    Star Trek: First Contact **1/2 (out of 4) 111 mins/ 12 Cast: Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, LeVar Burton, Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden, Marina Sirtis, Alfre Woodard, James Cromwell, Alice Krige, Neal McDonough Director: Jonathan Frakes Plot: The Enterprise D crew has to travel in time to face off against the evil Borg, who go way back with Captain Picard, as they try to prevent Earth's first contact with extra-terrestrial life. JJ's Verdict: Star Trek: First Contact starts off bold and proud with the theme tune playing over some well-made credits. With its reputation as the best Trek of them all, after reading the plot, you would expect bold and proud action that has a meaning to save the world. However, although we do get good action, it never seems through the camera or the characters eyes that they are fighting to save the universe and ends up just being about Picard fighting his demons and defeating the Borg for a personal achievement. In First Contact, the Enterprise crew are forced to time travel back to the mid-21st century as the Borg try to stop humans having first contact with aliens. We then find out that Captain Picard is dealing with demons once again because he was once taken in and transformed to become one of them. From here we get two groups of characters. The first are Riker and Geordi on Earth trying to make sure Zefram Cochran to fulfil his destiny and make first contact with aliens. Zefram is a cynical drunkard who is not too dissimilar to the character Dr. McCoy who was so loved by Trek fans back with the original crew. James Cromwell, portraying Cochran, brings a much needed freshness and quirkiness to the picture and gives us a very likable character. Back on the Enterprise we have an 'Alien' style survival against the Borg lead by Picard and Worf. Patrick Stewart, who of course plays Picard, once again brings his cool, commanding and cooling presence to the screen and if the state of the world really did depend on him, I'd be very happy indeed. All of these scenes have some great action and well-made chases but given its source material, feels a long way from the more human elements of the Original Crew's tenure. Sure, I love good action but it just doesn't feel like a 'Trek' film to me. Despite this, one scene at the start in which Picard disobeys orders from Starfleet is almost identical to one in Kirk and Co.'s final outing back in 1991 and feels awfully cringing. Another problem with the 'Alien' like scenes, are the aliens themselves, the Borg. Although Alice Krige puts in a creditable performance as the Borg, it is the Borg's motives which had me confused. To have power of the world, they are trying to stop human's first contact with aliens but surely, even if they stopped it then, there will be more opportunities to contact aliens. More Borg problems are that despite inhabiting their ship, the Borg will only kill the crew if they see them as a threat, and the crew will only kill the Borg if the Borg see the crew as a threat. Even when they are standing metres away form each other, they will only shoot if they sense that they are in danger. Why? I, unfortunately, cannot answer. The films visuals are the best out of all previous Trek films and so are the big-scoped space battles. More positives in the film are the dry wit in the script and great mix of seriousness and comic relief. However, this does have its downside because as the danger to Picard gets more serious, the comic relief given by James Cromwell increases which causes for a great sense of awkwardness as the two cut from one to another. Despite not being a 'Trek' film in the sense of the word, First Contact gives us an entertaining last twenty minutes, to be a decent but certainly watchable film.

    Star Trek: First Contact is widely considered to be 'The Wrath of Khan' of the New Generations films and rightly so. This film is a truly great film and to consider how it bounced back after 'Star Trek: Generations' is beyond me. Immediately into the film, we are told that Captain Picard, played by Patrick Stewart, was once assimilated by the Borg. News then breaks that a new Borg is prepared to attack Earth and the crew decide to disobey the orders of the Enterprise, with the android Data saying "To hell with our orders!" and so the Enterprise decide to help out a fleet that is attacked by the Borg. After the battle comes to an abrupt end, the Enterprise realize that the Borg has indeed used time travel to arrive at the day before aliens make first contact with Earth and must travel back in time to stop this from happening, which involves getting the creator of the Warp drive to activate it. I was extremely hesitant and afraid to watch this film, realizing how bad 'Generations' was. I could not take the pain of watching another bad Trek film, even when critics had stated it to be one of the best, I did not believe it! Thankfully, this is indeed one of the best and I personally rank it the second best. This opinion is subject to change once I do get to see JJ Abram's 2009 reboot but Star Trek: First Contact is an extremely interesting film with a far better written characters and story. Think back to 'Generations' when then android Data was simply making horrible jokes about an emotion chip that helps him understand jokes that were said years ago. Here, he is a far more interesting character and despite a few corny moments, Data is one of the highlights of the film. Take a look back at the villain in 'Generations' whose goal was to somehow travel back into the Nexus. Here, the villain is the Borg, possibly the coolest villain. First Contact also has the best action sequences in the series, up to date, and with a budget of $48 million, the film included great set pieces, possibly the best special effects up til now and was a commercial success, considering it made approximately 3 times its overall budget in the Box Office. The 'Star Trek' franchise suffers from often poor special effects, often tedious moments and corny dialogue that are only very limited in 'Wrath of Khan' and 'First Contact' The Borg were extremely interesting and intense villains and the Klingon Worf was extremely well done in the film. All the characters that were laughable in the previous entry to the Trek franchise have been re-done in a far more interesting way. The story itself is the best of the franchise and the visual effects and set piece have never looked better. A scene that stands out when referring to great set pieces for its time is the scene where Picard, Worf and the other officer are standing atop the Enterprise and attempting to thwart the plans of the Borg. Something interesting about this film is the direction they took with Data, whose motivations were clear: to be more human despite being a mechanical android. I love how the Borg gave him human skin and tried making him more human. That stuff worked very well in the film and gave another dimension to Data- something which 'Generations' utterly failed at. 'Star Trek: First Contact' is most definitely superior to 'Generations' and is the true introduction to the New Generations series. An extremely interesting premise is backed up by fantastic writing and directing, great action sequences and fantastic special effects. Quite possibly the best Trek film, along with 'Wrath of Khan' and a true surprise. Overall, this is one of the great Sci-Fi films.

    My wife and I watched the last 40 minutes of this movie on TV last night. She works for a production company that worked on "Into Darkness," and she had never seen any of the older Star Trek movies. I had seen "First Contact" when it came out in theaters, and I remembered that I really enjoyed it. At first I figured, "Well, I was a kid, and everything that involved space ships and lasers and explosions was cool back then." Boy, was I wrong. "First Contact" is not simply a sci-fi movie. In many ways, it is a movie about accepting responsibility and going the extra mile to do the right thing. Whether it's Picard refusing to abandon ship, or Data struggling to reject becoming a human (something he's always wanted), or Cochrane struggling to muster up the balls to test his FTL ship. Does it help to be a Star Trek fan? No, not really. It's not like they blindly reference old episodes from the show without any explanation - everything that happens is explained and easy to understand. Still, unlike JJ Abrams, this movie isn't dumbed down to encourage non-fans to give it a shot. I was surprised to find myself emotionally invested in the ending, especially after only tuning in over half-way through and having to explain several plot points to my wife (amazingly, I remembered MUCH more than I thought). And here's the crazy part, folks: you know how you can be flipping through the channels, come across a show or movie you haven't seen in a long time, it keeps your interest until the first commercial break, and then you change the channel? That didn't happen. My wife and I watched the whole damn thing - it kept our attention the entire time. And when a movie can do that, you know it's worth watching. I highly recommend this movie. I'll go so far as to say I think it's better than "Wrath of Khan." Yeah, I said it!

    In my opinion, this movie was pretty good. I love the analysis of Captain Jean Luc Picard's (Patrick Stewart) quest for revenge against the Borg being similar to Herman Melville's Moby Dick character Ahab whom in the book wanted revenge on a White Whale that took his leg. Six years ago, he was assimilation by the cybernetic Borg, and barely escape from it as shown in Star Trek: The Next Generation episode 'The Best of Both Worlds'. It's weird how there is two types of Picards. Picard here in the movie is like James T. Kirk, who acts in violence, disobey orders, and have pointless action scenes. In the TV series, Picard is a intelligent, mostly non-violence person who doesn't act upon violence unless it's a last resort. In the TV series, Picard was even nice to the Borgs choosing not to wipe them out when he had the chance because he believe that Borgs have the right to live. This belief happen after 'The Best of Both Worlds' episodes. Here in the movie, Picard is like I want to kill them all. Love the Holograph rampage that become a Internet meme later on. It's weird in a way, that the Federation was trying to stop Captain Jean Luc Picard from joining the Borg battle due to that reason. Despite him, knowing more about the enemy than anybody else in the Federation. I thought they would use him.In the past, at less in the Next Generation episodes, Picard was allowed to take control of three ships to kill the Borgs when they were trying to destroy a few space colonies. Anyways, Picard didn't follow the orders and join the fight against the Borgs in the beginning of the movie. Don't feel bad, Picard; the cast of Deep Space Nine wasn't invited despite USS Defiant being there. At less, the doctor from USS Voyager had a cameo in the film which was kinda funny. The Borgs were attacking Earth so they can assimilation them, but this is where the plot get confusing. The Borgs assimilates some, but allow others to live, because they don't find them a threat. By others- I meant people with guns.The writers of the movie wanted a story involving the Borgs, but the producer wanted a story involving time travel. The writers combined the two ideas; they initially set the film during the European Renaissance, but changed the time period the Borg corrupted to the mid-21st century after fearing the Renaissance idea would be too much like a bathetic novel. It would had been campy and over the top. Plus, Picard in tights wouldn't be a pretty sight. The entire plot doesn't make much sense, anyways. Rather than going to a remote part of space and time travel to Earth which would be safer for their Cube ship. They go near 24th century Earth where they were attack by hundreds of space ships. The cube ship is no shock destroy, as a Borg sphere ship escapes back into time in a worm hole which the USS Enterprise follows. The Enterprise arrives in the past, on April 4, 2063, the day before humanity's first contact with alien life after Zefram Cochrane's (James Cromwell) historic warp drive flight. James Cromwell was great and funny in the role. It's so unlike most of his serious dull roles that mostly follow his career. Still, it was a bit weird to see him play Cochrane and yet play other bit characters in the TV series such in the episodes 'The Hunted' and 'The Birth Right'. I just can't like Cochrane's assistant Lily Sloane (Alfre Woodard) because she always just in the way, and brings nothing to the table. Anyways the plot goes from assimilation them to now stopping first contact, which doesn't make any sense. If the humans never went to space the Borg would have never heard of them, so they wouldn't know they existed, so in a way, there would be erasing their history as well since there was no need to go to the Planet Earth. Plus, why are they assimilating them anyways? The Borg aren't primarily interested in humanity, a lesser species with unimpressive technology. They're making it seem that way, to attract the attention of the being they really want to assimilate says Q. Honestly, John de Lancie's omnipotent character Q was indeed in one of the first drafts of the screenplay. Anyways, the Borg Queen (Alice Krige) is probably my second favorite Star Trek villain besides Khan. She was pure evil. Alice was such a trooper. Krige suffered a large amount of discomfort filming her role; her costume was too tight, causing blisters, and the painful silver contact lenses she wore could only be kept in for four minutes at a time. Love the make up on her. The Borg were redesigned to appear as though they were converted into machine beings from the inside-out; the new makeup sessions took four times as long as on the television series. The supporting cast of the crew did what they can. Nothing worth saying about their acting. Commander Worf's (Michael Dorn) head still looks like a fanny. The special effect are great, surprising in the fact that Industrial Light & Magic rushed through it to complete the film's special effects in less than five months before the release date. The music is amazing, and yet another great job by Jerry Goldsmith. Love hearing Stepphenwolf 'Magic Carpet Ride" in the film. Director and cast member Jonathan Frakes AKA William Riker did a good job with his first film. Despite the sloppy writing and vague assumptions. I will admit the plot is full of holes, but I still really like this movie. There's a few inconsistencies, but they're forgivable with how great the action is. I know the Time Travel thing is a pretty bland idea, but overall this was quite an enjoyable film.

    The quintessential example of how a Star Trek movie should be done; (1) TNG cast are awesome (as usual), (2) The Enterprise has a new make over, (3) Beverley Crusher looking hotter than ever, (4) Great battle scenes, (5) Awesome new weapon with a cool name - Quantum torpedo, (6) The Borg - the best ST protagonist ever, (7) Witty dialogue and excellent character interactions (8) Troi was even decent !!! (9) The Borg Queen was fantastically portrayed (10) A truly awesome musical score.... .... what more is there to say? all but perfect! (The review is so concise and succinct that I have to add this to meet the minimum line requirements :P)

    The first movie spin-off from the Star Trek: Next Generation franchise felt like simply an extended double episode that was made for the big screen, and in a way I got the same impression with this film as well, even though I did enjoy it and enjoyed it somewhat the second time around. I have just finished watching all of the Deep Space 9 episodes and during that time I have been checking up a lot about the Star Trek universe on wikipedia, so when I read the entry for this movie I had a desire to watch it again. First Contact does come across like an extended episode, though no doubt it was more expensive that a simple episode. The crew returns with a new Enterprise (and new uniforms, which transfer over to Deep Space 9 at about the same time in the series). I am not sure where the other movies slip in though considering they seem to have been placed during the Dominion War. I do find it strange that we never see the new Enterprise E appearing in any of the later Deep Space 9 episodes, or even Picard making an appearance, considering that Starfleet's flagship would most likely be fighting on the front lines of what was quite a devastating war. The Borg have attacked Earth again, but the typical bureaucracy of Starfleet pushes Picard out to the Romulan Neutral Zone in case his previous encounters with the Borg may prove problematic to the defense of Earth. However, as is expected, Picard disobeys orders and returns to Earth just in time to destroy the ship. However it is not all over immediately as an escape pod is ejected and begins to travel back in time to the mid-21st century, and Picard orders his crew to follow it. This is where the title of the film comes in because they arrive a couple of days before Earth makes first contact with the Vulcans. Once again they destroy the borg ship, but not before it severely damages the first warp drive ship being built, and also not before them manage to transport onto the Enterprise and begin to assimilate the crew. As such there are two plots running concurrently. On Earth the away crew, led by Riker and La Forge are racing against time to get the ship launched on schedule, and also attempt to convince an alcoholic Zephram Cochraine to go ahead with his warp drive test to alert the Vulcans to their presence. The second plot has the crew of the Enterprise, led by Picard, attempting to deal with the borg and to stop them from alerting other borg of their presences and the presence of Earth. After watching the entire season of Deep Space 9 I have come to really appreciate the Star Trek universe and some of the races that appear therein. Of course I always balk at this idea of a perfect, cashless, religionless, society where humans are always trying to better themselves. It just seems to be to be an unrealistic utopia that could never come about. Further, the whole idea that humans do not engage in conflict anymore seems to be silly, particularly when there is conflict within the episodes. Obviously the idea is to write off such humans as bad influences (such as the Marquis) and consider them destructive to the Federation. I did quite enjoy this movie, though it is one of those movies that you do need some familiarity with the series to at least understand the characters. When the film opens it is automatically assumed that the audience knows who the characters are, there is really no introduction. As such to viewer who is not familiar with the Star Trek franchise, it can be a little confusion. Personally, having watched Star Trek in the past and being familiar with many of the characters that make an appearance, the problem is not really so great for me, and it is also difficult to see it from an alternate point of view. What was also a little disappointing was that the only character that came back from Deep Space 9 for the movie was Worf, and I noted that the crew of the Defiant were pretty much nameless crew members. It would have been good to have at least seen Dax in the episode, or maybe some of the other characters, but I suspect that bringing characters across from Deep Space 9 may have added some more awkwardness to the movie that is not needed. In a way it sort of come across as part horror movie, as far as Star Trek can go with the horror genre. I suspect that is what they were trying to do with the Borg invasion of the Enterprise. First we have them scooting around the ventilation ducts as if it were an Alien movie, then we have the Borg Queen grafting skin onto Data to give him the sensation of humanity. In some horror films the concept of flesh plays a significant role, however in this film it is simply the representation of Data's desire to become more human. In the end he does sacrifice his new found skin, and sensation, to save the lives of his friends.

    People act like the Star Trek Reboot and its sequel are the only times Star Trek has veered into the genre of straight up action: Those people however seem to forget about this installment. Star Trek: First Contact's plot is that Captain Picard and the crew of the Enterprise must stop the Borg from altering history. Now, I'm going to let you know right off the bat that the plot is the weakest part.Despite it being well told, it contains numerous plot holes that are kind of hard not to notice. And yet, that is overshadowed by the great acting, smart dialogue, terrific special effects, and phenomenal action scenes. First Contact is also one of the darkest of the Star Trek films, and it works well as the pacing picks up and the film gets more and more intense to the point where you are on the edge of your seat. First Contact stands as the ONLY good Next Generation film, and it is even better than Wrath of Khan.

    Star Trek: First Contact **1/2 (out of 4) 111 mins/ 12 Cast: Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, LeVar Burton, Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden, Marina Sirtis, Alfre Woodard, James Cromwell, Alice Krige, Neal McDonough Director: Jonathan Frakes Plot: The Enterprise D crew has to travel in time to face off against the evil Borg, who go way back with Captain Picard, as they try to prevent Earth's first contact with extra-terrestrial life. JJ's Verdict: Star Trek: First Contact starts off bold and proud with the theme tune playing over some well-made credits. With its reputation as the best Trek of them all, after reading the plot, you would expect bold and proud action that has a meaning to save the world. However, although we do get good action, it never seems through the camera or the characters eyes that they are fighting to save the universe and ends up just being about Picard fighting his demons and defeating the Borg for a personal achievement. In First Contact, the Enterprise crew are forced to time travel back to the mid-21st century as the Borg try to stop humans having first contact with aliens. We then find out that Captain Picard is dealing with demons once again because he was once taken in and transformed to become one of them. From here we get two groups of characters. The first are Riker and Geordi on Earth trying to make sure Zefram Cochran to fulfil his destiny and make first contact with aliens. Zefram is a cynical drunkard who is not too dissimilar to the character Dr. McCoy who was so loved by Trek fans back with the original crew. James Cromwell, portraying Cochran, brings a much needed freshness and quirkiness to the picture and gives us a very likable character. Back on the Enterprise we have an 'Alien' style survival against the Borg lead by Picard and Worf. Patrick Stewart, who of course plays Picard, once again brings his cool, commanding and cooling presence to the screen and if the state of the world really did depend on him, I'd be very happy indeed. All of these scenes have some great action and well-made chases but given its source material, feels a long way from the more human elements of the Original Crew's tenure. Sure, I love good action but it just doesn't feel like a 'Trek' film to me. Despite this, one scene at the start in which Picard disobeys orders from Starfleet is almost identical to one in Kirk and Co.'s final outing back in 1991 and feels awfully cringing. Another problem with the 'Alien' like scenes, are the aliens themselves, the Borg. Although Alice Krige puts in a creditable performance as the Borg, it is the Borg's motives which had me confused. To have power of the world, they are trying to stop human's first contact with aliens but surely, even if they stopped it then, there will be more opportunities to contact aliens. More Borg problems are that despite inhabiting their ship, the Borg will only kill the crew if they see them as a threat, and the crew will only kill the Borg if the Borg see the crew as a threat. Even when they are standing metres away form each other, they will only shoot if they sense that they are in danger. Why? I, unfortunately, cannot answer. The films visuals are the best out of all previous Trek films and so are the big-scoped space battles. More positives in the film are the dry wit in the script and great mix of seriousness and comic relief. However, this does have its downside because as the danger to Picard gets more serious, the comic relief given by James Cromwell increases which causes for a great sense of awkwardness as the two cut from one to another. Despite not being a 'Trek' film in the sense of the word, First Contact gives us an entertaining last twenty minutes, to be a decent but certainly watchable film.

    Star Trek: First Contact is widely considered to be 'The Wrath of Khan' of the New Generations films and rightly so. This film is a truly great film and to consider how it bounced back after 'Star Trek: Generations' is beyond me. Immediately into the film, we are told that Captain Picard, played by Patrick Stewart, was once assimilated by the Borg. News then breaks that a new Borg is prepared to attack Earth and the crew decide to disobey the orders of the Enterprise, with the android Data saying "To hell with our orders!" and so the Enterprise decide to help out a fleet that is attacked by the Borg. After the battle comes to an abrupt end, the Enterprise realize that the Borg has indeed used time travel to arrive at the day before aliens make first contact with Earth and must travel back in time to stop this from happening, which involves getting the creator of the Warp drive to activate it. I was extremely hesitant and afraid to watch this film, realizing how bad 'Generations' was. I could not take the pain of watching another bad Trek film, even when critics had stated it to be one of the best, I did not believe it! Thankfully, this is indeed one of the best and I personally rank it the second best. This opinion is subject to change once I do get to see JJ Abram's 2009 reboot but Star Trek: First Contact is an extremely interesting film with a far better written characters and story. Think back to 'Generations' when then android Data was simply making horrible jokes about an emotion chip that helps him understand jokes that were said years ago. Here, he is a far more interesting character and despite a few corny moments, Data is one of the highlights of the film. Take a look back at the villain in 'Generations' whose goal was to somehow travel back into the Nexus. Here, the villain is the Borg, possibly the coolest villain. First Contact also has the best action sequences in the series, up to date, and with a budget of $48 million, the film included great set pieces, possibly the best special effects up til now and was a commercial success, considering it made approximately 3 times its overall budget in the Box Office. The 'Star Trek' franchise suffers from often poor special effects, often tedious moments and corny dialogue that are only very limited in 'Wrath of Khan' and 'First Contact' The Borg were extremely interesting and intense villains and the Klingon Worf was extremely well done in the film. All the characters that were laughable in the previous entry to the Trek franchise have been re-done in a far more interesting way. The story itself is the best of the franchise and the visual effects and set piece have never looked better. A scene that stands out when referring to great set pieces for its time is the scene where Picard, Worf and the other officer are standing atop the Enterprise and attempting to thwart the plans of the Borg. Something interesting about this film is the direction they took with Data, whose motivations were clear: to be more human despite being a mechanical android. I love how the Borg gave him human skin and tried making him more human. That stuff worked very well in the film and gave another dimension to Data- something which 'Generations' utterly failed at. 'Star Trek: First Contact' is most definitely superior to 'Generations' and is the true introduction to the New Generations series. An extremely interesting premise is backed up by fantastic writing and directing, great action sequences and fantastic special effects. Quite possibly the best Trek film, along with 'Wrath of Khan' and a true surprise. Overall, this is one of the great Sci-Fi films.

    My wife and I watched the last 40 minutes of this movie on TV last night. She works for a production company that worked on "Into Darkness," and she had never seen any of the older Star Trek movies. I had seen "First Contact" when it came out in theaters, and I remembered that I really enjoyed it. At first I figured, "Well, I was a kid, and everything that involved space ships and lasers and explosions was cool back then." Boy, was I wrong. "First Contact" is not simply a sci-fi movie. In many ways, it is a movie about accepting responsibility and going the extra mile to do the right thing. Whether it's Picard refusing to abandon ship, or Data struggling to reject becoming a human (something he's always wanted), or Cochrane struggling to muster up the balls to test his FTL ship. Does it help to be a Star Trek fan? No, not really. It's not like they blindly reference old episodes from the show without any explanation - everything that happens is explained and easy to understand. Still, unlike JJ Abrams, this movie isn't dumbed down to encourage non-fans to give it a shot. I was surprised to find myself emotionally invested in the ending, especially after only tuning in over half-way through and having to explain several plot points to my wife (amazingly, I remembered MUCH more than I thought). And here's the crazy part, folks: you know how you can be flipping through the channels, come across a show or movie you haven't seen in a long time, it keeps your interest until the first commercial break, and then you change the channel? That didn't happen. My wife and I watched the whole damn thing - it kept our attention the entire time. And when a movie can do that, you know it's worth watching. I highly recommend this movie. I'll go so far as to say I think it's better than "Wrath of Khan." Yeah, I said it!

    In my opinion, this movie was pretty good. I love the analysis of Captain Jean Luc Picard's (Patrick Stewart) quest for revenge against the Borg being similar to Herman Melville's Moby Dick character Ahab whom in the book wanted revenge on a White Whale that took his leg. Six years ago, he was assimilation by the cybernetic Borg, and barely escape from it as shown in Star Trek: The Next Generation episode 'The Best of Both Worlds'. It's weird how there is two types of Picards. Picard here in the movie is like James T. Kirk, who acts in violence, disobey orders, and have pointless action scenes. In the TV series, Picard is a intelligent, mostly non-violence person who doesn't act upon violence unless it's a last resort. In the TV series, Picard was even nice to the Borgs choosing not to wipe them out when he had the chance because he believe that Borgs have the right to live. This belief happen after 'The Best of Both Worlds' episodes. Here in the movie, Picard is like I want to kill them all. Love the Holograph rampage that become a Internet meme later on. It's weird in a way, that the Federation was trying to stop Captain Jean Luc Picard from joining the Borg battle due to that reason. Despite him, knowing more about the enemy than anybody else in the Federation. I thought they would use him.In the past, at less in the Next Generation episodes, Picard was allowed to take control of three ships to kill the Borgs when they were trying to destroy a few space colonies. Anyways, Picard didn't follow the orders and join the fight against the Borgs in the beginning of the movie. Don't feel bad, Picard; the cast of Deep Space Nine wasn't invited despite USS Defiant being there. At less, the doctor from USS Voyager had a cameo in the film which was kinda funny. The Borgs were attacking Earth so they can assimilation them, but this is where the plot get confusing. The Borgs assimilates some, but allow others to live, because they don't find them a threat. By others- I meant people with guns.The writers of the movie wanted a story involving the Borgs, but the producer wanted a story involving time travel. The writers combined the two ideas; they initially set the film during the European Renaissance, but changed the time period the Borg corrupted to the mid-21st century after fearing the Renaissance idea would be too much like a bathetic novel. It would had been campy and over the top. Plus, Picard in tights wouldn't be a pretty sight. The entire plot doesn't make much sense, anyways. Rather than going to a remote part of space and time travel to Earth which would be safer for their Cube ship. They go near 24th century Earth where they were attack by hundreds of space ships. The cube ship is no shock destroy, as a Borg sphere ship escapes back into time in a worm hole which the USS Enterprise follows. The Enterprise arrives in the past, on April 4, 2063, the day before humanity's first contact with alien life after Zefram Cochrane's (James Cromwell) historic warp drive flight. James Cromwell was great and funny in the role. It's so unlike most of his serious dull roles that mostly follow his career. Still, it was a bit weird to see him play Cochrane and yet play other bit characters in the TV series such in the episodes 'The Hunted' and 'The Birth Right'. I just can't like Cochrane's assistant Lily Sloane (Alfre Woodard) because she always just in the way, and brings nothing to the table. Anyways the plot goes from assimilation them to now stopping first contact, which doesn't make any sense. If the humans never went to space the Borg would have never heard of them, so they wouldn't know they existed, so in a way, there would be erasing their history as well since there was no need to go to the Planet Earth. Plus, why are they assimilating them anyways? The Borg aren't primarily interested in humanity, a lesser species with unimpressive technology. They're making it seem that way, to attract the attention of the being they really want to assimilate says Q. Honestly, John de Lancie's omnipotent character Q was indeed in one of the first drafts of the screenplay. Anyways, the Borg Queen (Alice Krige) is probably my second favorite Star Trek villain besides Khan. She was pure evil. Alice was such a trooper. Krige suffered a large amount of discomfort filming her role; her costume was too tight, causing blisters, and the painful silver contact lenses she wore could only be kept in for four minutes at a time. Love the make up on her. The Borg were redesigned to appear as though they were converted into machine beings from the inside-out; the new makeup sessions took four times as long as on the television series. The supporting cast of the crew did what they can. Nothing worth saying about their acting. Commander Worf's (Michael Dorn) head still looks like a fanny. The special effect are great, surprising in the fact that Industrial Light & Magic rushed through it to complete the film's special effects in less than five months before the release date. The music is amazing, and yet another great job by Jerry Goldsmith. Love hearing Stepphenwolf 'Magic Carpet Ride" in the film. Director and cast member Jonathan Frakes AKA William Riker did a good job with his first film. Despite the sloppy writing and vague assumptions. I will admit the plot is full of holes, but I still really like this movie. There's a few inconsistencies, but they're forgivable with how great the action is. I know the Time Travel thing is a pretty bland idea, but overall this was quite an enjoyable film.

    The quintessential example of how a Star Trek movie should be done; (1) TNG cast are awesome (as usual), (2) The Enterprise has a new make over, (3) Beverley Crusher looking hotter than ever, (4) Great battle scenes, (5) Awesome new weapon with a cool name - Quantum torpedo, (6) The Borg - the best ST protagonist ever, (7) Witty dialogue and excellent character interactions (8) Troi was even decent !!! (9) The Borg Queen was fantastically portrayed (10) A truly awesome musical score.... .... what more is there to say? all but perfect! (The review is so concise and succinct that I have to add this to meet the minimum line requirements :P)

    The first movie spin-off from the Star Trek: Next Generation franchise felt like simply an extended double episode that was made for the big screen, and in a way I got the same impression with this film as well, even though I did enjoy it and enjoyed it somewhat the second time around. I have just finished watching all of the Deep Space 9 episodes and during that time I have been checking up a lot about the Star Trek universe on wikipedia, so when I read the entry for this movie I had a desire to watch it again. First Contact does come across like an extended episode, though no doubt it was more expensive that a simple episode. The crew returns with a new Enterprise (and new uniforms, which transfer over to Deep Space 9 at about the same time in the series). I am not sure where the other movies slip in though considering they seem to have been placed during the Dominion War. I do find it strange that we never see the new Enterprise E appearing in any of the later Deep Space 9 episodes, or even Picard making an appearance, considering that Starfleet's flagship would most likely be fighting on the front lines of what was quite a devastating war. The Borg have attacked Earth again, but the typical bureaucracy of Starfleet pushes Picard out to the Romulan Neutral Zone in case his previous encounters with the Borg may prove problematic to the defense of Earth. However, as is expected, Picard disobeys orders and returns to Earth just in time to destroy the ship. However it is not all over immediately as an escape pod is ejected and begins to travel back in time to the mid-21st century, and Picard orders his crew to follow it. This is where the title of the film comes in because they arrive a couple of days before Earth makes first contact with the Vulcans. Once again they destroy the borg ship, but not before it severely damages the first warp drive ship being built, and also not before them manage to transport onto the Enterprise and begin to assimilate the crew. As such there are two plots running concurrently. On Earth the away crew, led by Riker and La Forge are racing against time to get the ship launched on schedule, and also attempt to convince an alcoholic Zephram Cochraine to go ahead with his warp drive test to alert the Vulcans to their presence. The second plot has the crew of the Enterprise, led by Picard, attempting to deal with the borg and to stop them from alerting other borg of their presences and the presence of Earth. After watching the entire season of Deep Space 9 I have come to really appreciate the Star Trek universe and some of the races that appear therein. Of course I always balk at this idea of a perfect, cashless, religionless, society where humans are always trying to better themselves. It just seems to be to be an unrealistic utopia that could never come about. Further, the whole idea that humans do not engage in conflict anymore seems to be silly, particularly when there is conflict within the episodes. Obviously the idea is to write off such humans as bad influences (such as the Marquis) and consider them destructive to the Federation. I did quite enjoy this movie, though it is one of those movies that you do need some familiarity with the series to at least understand the characters. When the film opens it is automatically assumed that the audience knows who the characters are, there is really no introduction. As such to viewer who is not familiar with the Star Trek franchise, it can be a little confusion. Personally, having watched Star Trek in the past and being familiar with many of the characters that make an appearance, the problem is not really so great for me, and it is also difficult to see it from an alternate point of view. What was also a little disappointing was that the only character that came back from Deep Space 9 for the movie was Worf, and I noted that the crew of the Defiant were pretty much nameless crew members. It would have been good to have at least seen Dax in the episode, or maybe some of the other characters, but I suspect that bringing characters across from Deep Space 9 may have added some more awkwardness to the movie that is not needed. In a way it sort of come across as part horror movie, as far as Star Trek can go with the horror genre. I suspect that is what they were trying to do with the Borg invasion of the Enterprise. First we have them scooting around the ventilation ducts as if it were an Alien movie, then we have the Borg Queen grafting skin onto Data to give him the sensation of humanity. In some horror films the concept of flesh plays a significant role, however in this film it is simply the representation of Data's desire to become more human. In the end he does sacrifice his new found skin, and sensation, to save the lives of his friends.

    People act like the Star Trek Reboot and its sequel are the only times Star Trek has veered into the genre of straight up action: Those people however seem to forget about this installment. Star Trek: First Contact's plot is that Captain Picard and the crew of the Enterprise must stop the Borg from altering history. Now, I'm going to let you know right off the bat that the plot is the weakest part.Despite it being well told, it contains numerous plot holes that are kind of hard not to notice. And yet, that is overshadowed by the great acting, smart dialogue, terrific special effects, and phenomenal action scenes. First Contact is also one of the darkest of the Star Trek films, and it works well as the pacing picks up and the film gets more and more intense to the point where you are on the edge of your seat. First Contact stands as the ONLY good Next Generation film, and it is even better than Wrath of Khan.

    Star Trek: First Contact is a great movie with a really well developed storyline that will both fans of Star Trek: The Next Generation and fans of sci-fi in general.It is the first standalone movie for the Next Generation crew,and it is much better than their first movie,Generations,that crossed them over with a few members of the original Star Trek crew,it was much better seeing this crew on their own instead of throwing in William Shatner.Like all Star Treks,the cast is fantastic,but there was just something extra special about this one,them seemed much ore positive than usual,they clearly knew it was a great script.Fans of Star Trek and just fans of sci-fi,because it has enough in it not to confuse people who aren't aware of Star Trek,will be very pleased with First Contact. Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) must battle against his old enemy the Borg,as they try to change history for the worse.

    I would say that this is the last great Trek film which resembles Gene Roddenberry's vision of the series. All the magic ingredients are there, the sense of family and interaction between the crew, the jeopardy, the message and even the ship, all come together to give us what Star Trek was all about in just under two hours. Special efx are great, Alice Krige as the Borg Queen somehow manages to be sexy and creepy at the same time, there is a wonderful scene between her and Data which also somehow manages to be highly erotic though the only flesh on show is Data's wrist.......... For me, I find it both sad and astonishing to see how quickly Star Trek burnt out with the next film, perhaps less could have been more and the franchise should have been rested after this last great film? What came next lost the magic and even JJ Abrams' offerings are Flatland 2D efforts in Roddenberry's 3D Trek universe; flat cardboard and wafer-thin plots with no substance, plot, message or wonder whatsoever.

    Star Trek: First Contact **1/2 (out of 4) 111 mins/ 12 Cast: Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, LeVar Burton, Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden, Marina Sirtis, Alfre Woodard, James Cromwell, Alice Krige, Neal McDonough Director: Jonathan Frakes Plot: The Enterprise D crew has to travel in time to face off against the evil Borg, who go way back with Captain Picard, as they try to prevent Earth's first contact with extra-terrestrial life. JJ's Verdict: Star Trek: First Contact starts off bold and proud with the theme tune playing over some well-made credits. With its reputation as the best Trek of them all, after reading the plot, you would expect bold and proud action that has a meaning to save the world. However, although we do get good action, it never seems through the camera or the characters eyes that they are fighting to save the universe and ends up just being about Picard fighting his demons and defeating the Borg for a personal achievement. In First Contact, the Enterprise crew are forced to time travel back to the mid-21st century as the Borg try to stop humans having first contact with aliens. We then find out that Captain Picard is dealing with demons once again because he was once taken in and transformed to become one of them. From here we get two groups of characters. The first are Riker and Geordi on Earth trying to make sure Zefram Cochran to fulfil his destiny and make first contact with aliens. Zefram is a cynical drunkard who is not too dissimilar to the character Dr. McCoy who was so loved by Trek fans back with the original crew. James Cromwell, portraying Cochran, brings a much needed freshness and quirkiness to the picture and gives us a very likable character. Back on the Enterprise we have an 'Alien' style survival against the Borg lead by Picard and Worf. Patrick Stewart, who of course plays Picard, once again brings his cool, commanding and cooling presence to the screen and if the state of the world really did depend on him, I'd be very happy indeed. All of these scenes have some great action and well-made chases but given its source material, feels a long way from the more human elements of the Original Crew's tenure. Sure, I love good action but it just doesn't feel like a 'Trek' film to me. Despite this, one scene at the start in which Picard disobeys orders from Starfleet is almost identical to one in Kirk and Co.'s final outing back in 1991 and feels awfully cringing. Another problem with the 'Alien' like scenes, are the aliens themselves, the Borg. Although Alice Krige puts in a creditable performance as the Borg, it is the Borg's motives which had me confused. To have power of the world, they are trying to stop human's first contact with aliens but surely, even if they stopped it then, there will be more opportunities to contact aliens. More Borg problems are that despite inhabiting their ship, the Borg will only kill the crew if they see them as a threat, and the crew will only kill the Borg if the Borg see the crew as a threat. Even when they are standing metres away form each other, they will only shoot if they sense that they are in danger. Why? I, unfortunately, cannot answer. The films visuals are the best out of all previous Trek films and so are the big-scoped space battles. More positives in the film are the dry wit in the script and great mix of seriousness and comic relief. However, this does have its downside because as the danger to Picard gets more serious, the comic relief given by James Cromwell increases which causes for a great sense of awkwardness as the two cut from one to another. Despite not being a 'Trek' film in the sense of the word, First Contact gives us an entertaining last twenty minutes, to be a decent but certainly watchable film.

    Star Trek: First Contact is widely considered to be 'The Wrath of Khan' of the New Generations films and rightly so. This film is a truly great film and to consider how it bounced back after 'Star Trek: Generations' is beyond me. Immediately into the film, we are told that Captain Picard, played by Patrick Stewart, was once assimilated by the Borg. News then breaks that a new Borg is prepared to attack Earth and the crew decide to disobey the orders of the Enterprise, with the android Data saying "To hell with our orders!" and so the Enterprise decide to help out a fleet that is attacked by the Borg. After the battle comes to an abrupt end, the Enterprise realize that the Borg has indeed used time travel to arrive at the day before aliens make first contact with Earth and must travel back in time to stop this from happening, which involves getting the creator of the Warp drive to activate it. I was extremely hesitant and afraid to watch this film, realizing how bad 'Generations' was. I could not take the pain of watching another bad Trek film, even when critics had stated it to be one of the best, I did not believe it! Thankfully, this is indeed one of the best and I personally rank it the second best. This opinion is subject to change once I do get to see JJ Abram's 2009 reboot but Star Trek: First Contact is an extremely interesting film with a far better written characters and story. Think back to 'Generations' when then android Data was simply making horrible jokes about an emotion chip that helps him understand jokes that were said years ago. Here, he is a far more interesting character and despite a few corny moments, Data is one of the highlights of the film. Take a look back at the villain in 'Generations' whose goal was to somehow travel back into the Nexus. Here, the villain is the Borg, possibly the coolest villain. First Contact also has the best action sequences in the series, up to date, and with a budget of $48 million, the film included great set pieces, possibly the best special effects up til now and was a commercial success, considering it made approximately 3 times its overall budget in the Box Office. The 'Star Trek' franchise suffers from often poor special effects, often tedious moments and corny dialogue that are only very limited in 'Wrath of Khan' and 'First Contact' The Borg were extremely interesting and intense villains and the Klingon Worf was extremely well done in the film. All the characters that were laughable in the previous entry to the Trek franchise have been re-done in a far more interesting way. The story itself is the best of the franchise and the visual effects and set piece have never looked better. A scene that stands out when referring to great set pieces for its time is the scene where Picard, Worf and the other officer are standing atop the Enterprise and attempting to thwart the plans of the Borg. Something interesting about this film is the direction they took with Data, whose motivations were clear: to be more human despite being a mechanical android. I love how the Borg gave him human skin and tried making him more human. That stuff worked very well in the film and gave another dimension to Data- something which 'Generations' utterly failed at. 'Star Trek: First Contact' is most definitely superior to 'Generations' and is the true introduction to the New Generations series. An extremely interesting premise is backed up by fantastic writing and directing, great action sequences and fantastic special effects. Quite possibly the best Trek film, along with 'Wrath of Khan' and a true surprise. Overall, this is one of the great Sci-Fi films.

    My wife and I watched the last 40 minutes of this movie on TV last night. She works for a production company that worked on "Into Darkness," and she had never seen any of the older Star Trek movies. I had seen "First Contact" when it came out in theaters, and I remembered that I really enjoyed it. At first I figured, "Well, I was a kid, and everything that involved space ships and lasers and explosions was cool back then." Boy, was I wrong. "First Contact" is not simply a sci-fi movie. In many ways, it is a movie about accepting responsibility and going the extra mile to do the right thing. Whether it's Picard refusing to abandon ship, or Data struggling to reject becoming a human (something he's always wanted), or Cochrane struggling to muster up the balls to test his FTL ship. Does it help to be a Star Trek fan? No, not really. It's not like they blindly reference old episodes from the show without any explanation - everything that happens is explained and easy to understand. Still, unlike JJ Abrams, this movie isn't dumbed down to encourage non-fans to give it a shot. I was surprised to find myself emotionally invested in the ending, especially after only tuning in over half-way through and having to explain several plot points to my wife (amazingly, I remembered MUCH more than I thought). And here's the crazy part, folks: you know how you can be flipping through the channels, come across a show or movie you haven't seen in a long time, it keeps your interest until the first commercial break, and then you change the channel? That didn't happen. My wife and I watched the whole damn thing - it kept our attention the entire time. And when a movie can do that, you know it's worth watching. I highly recommend this movie. I'll go so far as to say I think it's better than "Wrath of Khan." Yeah, I said it!

    In my opinion, this movie was pretty good. I love the analysis of Captain Jean Luc Picard's (Patrick Stewart) quest for revenge against the Borg being similar to Herman Melville's Moby Dick character Ahab whom in the book wanted revenge on a White Whale that took his leg. Six years ago, he was assimilation by the cybernetic Borg, and barely escape from it as shown in Star Trek: The Next Generation episode 'The Best of Both Worlds'. It's weird how there is two types of Picards. Picard here in the movie is like James T. Kirk, who acts in violence, disobey orders, and have pointless action scenes. In the TV series, Picard is a intelligent, mostly non-violence person who doesn't act upon violence unless it's a last resort. In the TV series, Picard was even nice to the Borgs choosing not to wipe them out when he had the chance because he believe that Borgs have the right to live. This belief happen after 'The Best of Both Worlds' episodes. Here in the movie, Picard is like I want to kill them all. Love the Holograph rampage that become a Internet meme later on. It's weird in a way, that the Federation was trying to stop Captain Jean Luc Picard from joining the Borg battle due to that reason. Despite him, knowing more about the enemy than anybody else in the Federation. I thought they would use him.In the past, at less in the Next Generation episodes, Picard was allowed to take control of three ships to kill the Borgs when they were trying to destroy a few space colonies. Anyways, Picard didn't follow the orders and join the fight against the Borgs in the beginning of the movie. Don't feel bad, Picard; the cast of Deep Space Nine wasn't invited despite USS Defiant being there. At less, the doctor from USS Voyager had a cameo in the film which was kinda funny. The Borgs were attacking Earth so they can assimilation them, but this is where the plot get confusing. The Borgs assimilates some, but allow others to live, because they don't find them a threat. By others- I meant people with guns.The writers of the movie wanted a story involving the Borgs, but the producer wanted a story involving time travel. The writers combined the two ideas; they initially set the film during the European Renaissance, but changed the time period the Borg corrupted to the mid-21st century after fearing the Renaissance idea would be too much like a bathetic novel. It would had been campy and over the top. Plus, Picard in tights wouldn't be a pretty sight. The entire plot doesn't make much sense, anyways. Rather than going to a remote part of space and time travel to Earth which would be safer for their Cube ship. They go near 24th century Earth where they were attack by hundreds of space ships. The cube ship is no shock destroy, as a Borg sphere ship escapes back into time in a worm hole which the USS Enterprise follows. The Enterprise arrives in the past, on April 4, 2063, the day before humanity's first contact with alien life after Zefram Cochrane's (James Cromwell) historic warp drive flight. James Cromwell was great and funny in the role. It's so unlike most of his serious dull roles that mostly follow his career. Still, it was a bit weird to see him play Cochrane and yet play other bit characters in the TV series such in the episodes 'The Hunted' and 'The Birth Right'. I just can't like Cochrane's assistant Lily Sloane (Alfre Woodard) because she always just in the way, and brings nothing to the table. Anyways the plot goes from assimilation them to now stopping first contact, which doesn't make any sense. If the humans never went to space the Borg would have never heard of them, so they wouldn't know they existed, so in a way, there would be erasing their history as well since there was no need to go to the Planet Earth. Plus, why are they assimilating them anyways? The Borg aren't primarily interested in humanity, a lesser species with unimpressive technology. They're making it seem that way, to attract the attention of the being they really want to assimilate says Q. Honestly, John de Lancie's omnipotent character Q was indeed in one of the first drafts of the screenplay. Anyways, the Borg Queen (Alice Krige) is probably my second favorite Star Trek villain besides Khan. She was pure evil. Alice was such a trooper. Krige suffered a large amount of discomfort filming her role; her costume was too tight, causing blisters, and the painful silver contact lenses she wore could only be kept in for four minutes at a time. Love the make up on her. The Borg were redesigned to appear as though they were converted into machine beings from the inside-out; the new makeup sessions took four times as long as on the television series. The supporting cast of the crew did what they can. Nothing worth saying about their acting. Commander Worf's (Michael Dorn) head still looks like a fanny. The special effect are great, surprising in the fact that Industrial Light & Magic rushed through it to complete the film's special effects in less than five months before the release date. The music is amazing, and yet another great job by Jerry Goldsmith. Love hearing Stepphenwolf 'Magic Carpet Ride" in the film. Director and cast member Jonathan Frakes AKA William Riker did a good job with his first film. Despite the sloppy writing and vague assumptions. I will admit the plot is full of holes, but I still really like this movie. There's a few inconsistencies, but they're forgivable with how great the action is. I know the Time Travel thing is a pretty bland idea, but overall this was quite an enjoyable film.

    The quintessential example of how a Star Trek movie should be done; (1) TNG cast are awesome (as usual), (2) The Enterprise has a new make over, (3) Beverley Crusher looking hotter than ever, (4) Great battle scenes, (5) Awesome new weapon with a cool name - Quantum torpedo, (6) The Borg - the best ST protagonist ever, (7) Witty dialogue and excellent character interactions (8) Troi was even decent !!! (9) The Borg Queen was fantastically portrayed (10) A truly awesome musical score.... .... what more is there to say? all but perfect! (The review is so concise and succinct that I have to add this to meet the minimum line requirements :P)

    The first movie spin-off from the Star Trek: Next Generation franchise felt like simply an extended double episode that was made for the big screen, and in a way I got the same impression with this film as well, even though I did enjoy it and enjoyed it somewhat the second time around. I have just finished watching all of the Deep Space 9 episodes and during that time I have been checking up a lot about the Star Trek universe on wikipedia, so when I read the entry for this movie I had a desire to watch it again. First Contact does come across like an extended episode, though no doubt it was more expensive that a simple episode. The crew returns with a new Enterprise (and new uniforms, which transfer over to Deep Space 9 at about the same time in the series). I am not sure where the other movies slip in though considering they seem to have been placed during the Dominion War. I do find it strange that we never see the new Enterprise E appearing in any of the later Deep Space 9 episodes, or even Picard making an appearance, considering that Starfleet's flagship would most likely be fighting on the front lines of what was quite a devastating war. The Borg have attacked Earth again, but the typical bureaucracy of Starfleet pushes Picard out to the Romulan Neutral Zone in case his previous encounters with the Borg may prove problematic to the defense of Earth. However, as is expected, Picard disobeys orders and returns to Earth just in time to destroy the ship. However it is not all over immediately as an escape pod is ejected and begins to travel back in time to the mid-21st century, and Picard orders his crew to follow it. This is where the title of the film comes in because they arrive a couple of days before Earth makes first contact with the Vulcans. Once again they destroy the borg ship, but not before it severely damages the first warp drive ship being built, and also not before them manage to transport onto the Enterprise and begin to assimilate the crew. As such there are two plots running concurrently. On Earth the away crew, led by Riker and La Forge are racing against time to get the ship launched on schedule, and also attempt to convince an alcoholic Zephram Cochraine to go ahead with his warp drive test to alert the Vulcans to their presence. The second plot has the crew of the Enterprise, led by Picard, attempting to deal with the borg and to stop them from alerting other borg of their presences and the presence of Earth. After watching the entire season of Deep Space 9 I have come to really appreciate the Star Trek universe and some of the races that appear therein. Of course I always balk at this idea of a perfect, cashless, religionless, society where humans are always trying to better themselves. It just seems to be to be an unrealistic utopia that could never come about. Further, the whole idea that humans do not engage in conflict anymore seems to be silly, particularly when there is conflict within the episodes. Obviously the idea is to write off such humans as bad influences (such as the Marquis) and consider them destructive to the Federation. I did quite enjoy this movie, though it is one of those movies that you do need some familiarity with the series to at least understand the characters. When the film opens it is automatically assumed that the audience knows who the characters are, there is really no introduction. As such to viewer who is not familiar with the Star Trek franchise, it can be a little confusion. Personally, having watched Star Trek in the past and being familiar with many of the characters that make an appearance, the problem is not really so great for me, and it is also difficult to see it from an alternate point of view. What was also a little disappointing was that the only character that came back from Deep Space 9 for the movie was Worf, and I noted that the crew of the Defiant were pretty much nameless crew members. It would have been good to have at least seen Dax in the episode, or maybe some of the other characters, but I suspect that bringing characters across from Deep Space 9 may have added some more awkwardness to the movie that is not needed. In a way it sort of come across as part horror movie, as far as Star Trek can go with the horror genre. I suspect that is what they were trying to do with the Borg invasion of the Enterprise. First we have them scooting around the ventilation ducts as if it were an Alien movie, then we have the Borg Queen grafting skin onto Data to give him the sensation of humanity. In some horror films the concept of flesh plays a significant role, however in this film it is simply the representation of Data's desire to become more human. In the end he does sacrifice his new found skin, and sensation, to save the lives of his friends.

    People act like the Star Trek Reboot and its sequel are the only times Star Trek has veered into the genre of straight up action: Those people however seem to forget about this installment. Star Trek: First Contact's plot is that Captain Picard and the crew of the Enterprise must stop the Borg from altering history. Now, I'm going to let you know right off the bat that the plot is the weakest part.Despite it being well told, it contains numerous plot holes that are kind of hard not to notice. And yet, that is overshadowed by the great acting, smart dialogue, terrific special effects, and phenomenal action scenes. First Contact is also one of the darkest of the Star Trek films, and it works well as the pacing picks up and the film gets more and more intense to the point where you are on the edge of your seat. First Contact stands as the ONLY good Next Generation film, and it is even better than Wrath of Khan.

    Star Trek: First Contact is a great movie with a really well developed storyline that will both fans of Star Trek: The Next Generation and fans of sci-fi in general.It is the first standalone movie for the Next Generation crew,and it is much better than their first movie,Generations,that crossed them over with a few members of the original Star Trek crew,it was much better seeing this crew on their own instead of throwing in William Shatner.Like all Star Treks,the cast is fantastic,but there was just something extra special about this one,them seemed much ore positive than usual,they clearly knew it was a great script.Fans of Star Trek and just fans of sci-fi,because it has enough in it not to confuse people who aren't aware of Star Trek,will be very pleased with First Contact. Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) must battle against his old enemy the Borg,as they try to change history for the worse.

    I would say that this is the last great Trek film which resembles Gene Roddenberry's vision of the series. All the magic ingredients are there, the sense of family and interaction between the crew, the jeopardy, the message and even the ship, all come together to give us what Star Trek was all about in just under two hours. Special efx are great, Alice Krige as the Borg Queen somehow manages to be sexy and creepy at the same time, there is a wonderful scene between her and Data which also somehow manages to be highly erotic though the only flesh on show is Data's wrist.......... For me, I find it both sad and astonishing to see how quickly Star Trek burnt out with the next film, perhaps less could have been more and the franchise should have been rested after this last great film? What came next lost the magic and even JJ Abrams' offerings are Flatland 2D efforts in Roddenberry's 3D Trek universe; flat cardboard and wafer-thin plots with no substance, plot, message or wonder whatsoever.

    Star Trek: First Contact **1/2 (out of 4) 111 mins/ 12 Cast: Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, LeVar Burton, Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden, Marina Sirtis, Alfre Woodard, James Cromwell, Alice Krige, Neal McDonough Director: Jonathan Frakes Plot: The Enterprise D crew has to travel in time to face off against the evil Borg, who go way back with Captain Picard, as they try to prevent Earth's first contact with extra-terrestrial life. JJ's Verdict: Star Trek: First Contact starts off bold and proud with the theme tune playing over some well-made credits. With its reputation as the best Trek of them all, after reading the plot, you would expect bold and proud action that has a meaning to save the world. However, although we do get good action, it never seems through the camera or the characters eyes that they are fighting to save the universe and ends up just being about Picard fighting his demons and defeating the Borg for a personal achievement. In First Contact, the Enterprise crew are forced to time travel back to the mid-21st century as the Borg try to stop humans having first contact with aliens. We then find out that Captain Picard is dealing with demons once again because he was once taken in and transformed to become one of them. From here we get two groups of characters. The first are Riker and Geordi on Earth trying to make sure Zefram Cochran to fulfil his destiny and make first contact with aliens. Zefram is a cynical drunkard who is not too dissimilar to the character Dr. McCoy who was so loved by Trek fans back with the original crew. James Cromwell, portraying Cochran, brings a much needed freshness and quirkiness to the picture and gives us a very likable character. Back on the Enterprise we have an 'Alien' style survival against the Borg lead by Picard and Worf. Patrick Stewart, who of course plays Picard, once again brings his cool, commanding and cooling presence to the screen and if the state of the world really did depend on him, I'd be very happy indeed. All of these scenes have some great action and well-made chases but given its source material, feels a long way from the more human elements of the Original Crew's tenure. Sure, I love good action but it just doesn't feel like a 'Trek' film to me. Despite this, one scene at the start in which Picard disobeys orders from Starfleet is almost identical to one in Kirk and Co.'s final outing back in 1991 and feels awfully cringing. Another problem with the 'Alien' like scenes, are the aliens themselves, the Borg. Although Alice Krige puts in a creditable performance as the Borg, it is the Borg's motives which had me confused. To have power of the world, they are trying to stop human's first contact with aliens but surely, even if they stopped it then, there will be more opportunities to contact aliens. More Borg problems are that despite inhabiting their ship, the Borg will only kill the crew if they see them as a threat, and the crew will only kill the Borg if the Borg see the crew as a threat. Even when they are standing metres away form each other, they will only shoot if they sense that they are in danger. Why? I, unfortunately, cannot answer. The films visuals are the best out of all previous Trek films and so are the big-scoped space battles. More positives in the film are the dry wit in the script and great mix of seriousness and comic relief. However, this does have its downside because as the danger to Picard gets more serious, the comic relief given by James Cromwell increases which causes for a great sense of awkwardness as the two cut from one to another. Despite not being a 'Trek' film in the sense of the word, First Contact gives us an entertaining last twenty minutes, to be a decent but certainly watchable film.

    Star Trek: First Contact is widely considered to be 'The Wrath of Khan' of the New Generations films and rightly so. This film is a truly great film and to consider how it bounced back after 'Star Trek: Generations' is beyond me. Immediately into the film, we are told that Captain Picard, played by Patrick Stewart, was once assimilated by the Borg. News then breaks that a new Borg is prepared to attack Earth and the crew decide to disobey the orders of the Enterprise, with the android Data saying "To hell with our orders!" and so the Enterprise decide to help out a fleet that is attacked by the Borg. After the battle comes to an abrupt end, the Enterprise realize that the Borg has indeed used time travel to arrive at the day before aliens make first contact with Earth and must travel back in time to stop this from happening, which involves getting the creator of the Warp drive to activate it. I was extremely hesitant and afraid to watch this film, realizing how bad 'Generations' was. I could not take the pain of watching another bad Trek film, even when critics had stated it to be one of the best, I did not believe it! Thankfully, this is indeed one of the best and I personally rank it the second best. This opinion is subject to change once I do get to see JJ Abram's 2009 reboot but Star Trek: First Contact is an extremely interesting film with a far better written characters and story. Think back to 'Generations' when then android Data was simply making horrible jokes about an emotion chip that helps him understand jokes that were said years ago. Here, he is a far more interesting character and despite a few corny moments, Data is one of the highlights of the film. Take a look back at the villain in 'Generations' whose goal was to somehow travel back into the Nexus. Here, the villain is the Borg, possibly the coolest villain. First Contact also has the best action sequences in the series, up to date, and with a budget of $48 million, the film included great set pieces, possibly the best special effects up til now and was a commercial success, considering it made approximately 3 times its overall budget in the Box Office. The 'Star Trek' franchise suffers from often poor special effects, often tedious moments and corny dialogue that are only very limited in 'Wrath of Khan' and 'First Contact' The Borg were extremely interesting and intense villains and the Klingon Worf was extremely well done in the film. All the characters that were laughable in the previous entry to the Trek franchise have been re-done in a far more interesting way. The story itself is the best of the franchise and the visual effects and set piece have never looked better. A scene that stands out when referring to great set pieces for its time is the scene where Picard, Worf and the other officer are standing atop the Enterprise and attempting to thwart the plans of the Borg. Something interesting about this film is the direction they took with Data, whose motivations were clear: to be more human despite being a mechanical android. I love how the Borg gave him human skin and tried making him more human. That stuff worked very well in the film and gave another dimension to Data- something which 'Generations' utterly failed at. 'Star Trek: First Contact' is most definitely superior to 'Generations' and is the true introduction to the New Generations series. An extremely interesting premise is backed up by fantastic writing and directing, great action sequences and fantastic special effects. Quite possibly the best Trek film, along with 'Wrath of Khan' and a true surprise. Overall, this is one of the great Sci-Fi films.

    My wife and I watched the last 40 minutes of this movie on TV last night. She works for a production company that worked on "Into Darkness," and she had never seen any of the older Star Trek movies. I had seen "First Contact" when it came out in theaters, and I remembered that I really enjoyed it. At first I figured, "Well, I was a kid, and everything that involved space ships and lasers and explosions was cool back then." Boy, was I wrong. "First Contact" is not simply a sci-fi movie. In many ways, it is a movie about accepting responsibility and going the extra mile to do the right thing. Whether it's Picard refusing to abandon ship, or Data struggling to reject becoming a human (something he's always wanted), or Cochrane struggling to muster up the balls to test his FTL ship. Does it help to be a Star Trek fan? No, not really. It's not like they blindly reference old episodes from the show without any explanation - everything that happens is explained and easy to understand. Still, unlike JJ Abrams, this movie isn't dumbed down to encourage non-fans to give it a shot. I was surprised to find myself emotionally invested in the ending, especially after only tuning in over half-way through and having to explain several plot points to my wife (amazingly, I remembered MUCH more than I thought). And here's the crazy part, folks: you know how you can be flipping through the channels, come across a show or movie you haven't seen in a long time, it keeps your interest until the first commercial break, and then you change the channel? That didn't happen. My wife and I watched the whole damn thing - it kept our attention the entire time. And when a movie can do that, you know it's worth watching. I highly recommend this movie. I'll go so far as to say I think it's better than "Wrath of Khan." Yeah, I said it!

    In my opinion, this movie was pretty good. I love the analysis of Captain Jean Luc Picard's (Patrick Stewart) quest for revenge against the Borg being similar to Herman Melville's Moby Dick character Ahab whom in the book wanted revenge on a White Whale that took his leg. Six years ago, he was assimilation by the cybernetic Borg, and barely escape from it as shown in Star Trek: The Next Generation episode 'The Best of Both Worlds'. It's weird how there is two types of Picards. Picard here in the movie is like James T. Kirk, who acts in violence, disobey orders, and have pointless action scenes. In the TV series, Picard is a intelligent, mostly non-violence person who doesn't act upon violence unless it's a last resort. In the TV series, Picard was even nice to the Borgs choosing not to wipe them out when he had the chance because he believe that Borgs have the right to live. This belief happen after 'The Best of Both Worlds' episodes. Here in the movie, Picard is like I want to kill them all. Love the Holograph rampage that become a Internet meme later on. It's weird in a way, that the Federation was trying to stop Captain Jean Luc Picard from joining the Borg battle due to that reason. Despite him, knowing more about the enemy than anybody else in the Federation. I thought they would use him.In the past, at less in the Next Generation episodes, Picard was allowed to take control of three ships to kill the Borgs when they were trying to destroy a few space colonies. Anyways, Picard didn't follow the orders and join the fight against the Borgs in the beginning of the movie. Don't feel bad, Picard; the cast of Deep Space Nine wasn't invited despite USS Defiant being there. At less, the doctor from USS Voyager had a cameo in the film which was kinda funny. The Borgs were attacking Earth so they can assimilation them, but this is where the plot get confusing. The Borgs assimilates some, but allow others to live, because they don't find them a threat. By others- I meant people with guns.The writers of the movie wanted a story involving the Borgs, but the producer wanted a story involving time travel. The writers combined the two ideas; they initially set the film during the European Renaissance, but changed the time period the Borg corrupted to the mid-21st century after fearing the Renaissance idea would be too much like a bathetic novel. It would had been campy and over the top. Plus, Picard in tights wouldn't be a pretty sight. The entire plot doesn't make much sense, anyways. Rather than going to a remote part of space and time travel to Earth which would be safer for their Cube ship. They go near 24th century Earth where they were attack by hundreds of space ships. The cube ship is no shock destroy, as a Borg sphere ship escapes back into time in a worm hole which the USS Enterprise follows. The Enterprise arrives in the past, on April 4, 2063, the day before humanity's first contact with alien life after Zefram Cochrane's (James Cromwell) historic warp drive flight. James Cromwell was great and funny in the role. It's so unlike most of his serious dull roles that mostly follow his career. Still, it was a bit weird to see him play Cochrane and yet play other bit characters in the TV series such in the episodes 'The Hunted' and 'The Birth Right'. I just can't like Cochrane's assistant Lily Sloane (Alfre Woodard) because she always just in the way, and brings nothing to the table. Anyways the plot goes from assimilation them to now stopping first contact, which doesn't make any sense. If the humans never went to space the Borg would have never heard of them, so they wouldn't know they existed, so in a way, there would be erasing their history as well since there was no need to go to the Planet Earth. Plus, why are they assimilating them anyways? The Borg aren't primarily interested in humanity, a lesser species with unimpressive technology. They're making it seem that way, to attract the attention of the being they really want to assimilate says Q. Honestly, John de Lancie's omnipotent character Q was indeed in one of the first drafts of the screenplay. Anyways, the Borg Queen (Alice Krige) is probably my second favorite Star Trek villain besides Khan. She was pure evil. Alice was such a trooper. Krige suffered a large amount of discomfort filming her role; her costume was too tight, causing blisters, and the painful silver contact lenses she wore could only be kept in for four minutes at a time. Love the make up on her. The Borg were redesigned to appear as though they were converted into machine beings from the inside-out; the new makeup sessions took four times as long as on the television series. The supporting cast of the crew did what they can. Nothing worth saying about their acting. Commander Worf's (Michael Dorn) head still looks like a fanny. The special effect are great, surprising in the fact that Industrial Light & Magic rushed through it to complete the film's special effects in less than five months before the release date. The music is amazing, and yet another great job by Jerry Goldsmith. Love hearing Stepphenwolf 'Magic Carpet Ride" in the film. Director and cast member Jonathan Frakes AKA William Riker did a good job with his first film. Despite the sloppy writing and vague assumptions. I will admit the plot is full of holes, but I still really like this movie. There's a few inconsistencies, but they're forgivable with how great the action is. I know the Time Travel thing is a pretty bland idea, but overall this was quite an enjoyable film.

    The quintessential example of how a Star Trek movie should be done; (1) TNG cast are awesome (as usual), (2) The Enterprise has a new make over, (3) Beverley Crusher looking hotter than ever, (4) Great battle scenes, (5) Awesome new weapon with a cool name - Quantum torpedo, (6) The Borg - the best ST protagonist ever, (7) Witty dialogue and excellent character interactions (8) Troi was even decent !!! (9) The Borg Queen was fantastically portrayed (10) A truly awesome musical score.... .... what more is there to say? all but perfect! (The review is so concise and succinct that I have to add this to meet the minimum line requirements :P)

    The first movie spin-off from the Star Trek: Next Generation franchise felt like simply an extended double episode that was made for the big screen, and in a way I got the same impression with this film as well, even though I did enjoy it and enjoyed it somewhat the second time around. I have just finished watching all of the Deep Space 9 episodes and during that time I have been checking up a lot about the Star Trek universe on wikipedia, so when I read the entry for this movie I had a desire to watch it again. First Contact does come across like an extended episode, though no doubt it was more expensive that a simple episode. The crew returns with a new Enterprise (and new uniforms, which transfer over to Deep Space 9 at about the same time in the series). I am not sure where the other movies slip in though considering they seem to have been placed during the Dominion War. I do find it strange that we never see the new Enterprise E appearing in any of the later Deep Space 9 episodes, or even Picard making an appearance, considering that Starfleet's flagship would most likely be fighting on the front lines of what was quite a devastating war. The Borg have attacked Earth again, but the typical bureaucracy of Starfleet pushes Picard out to the Romulan Neutral Zone in case his previous encounters with the Borg may prove problematic to the defense of Earth. However, as is expected, Picard disobeys orders and returns to Earth just in time to destroy the ship. However it is not all over immediately as an escape pod is ejected and begins to travel back in time to the mid-21st century, and Picard orders his crew to follow it. This is where the title of the film comes in because they arrive a couple of days before Earth makes first contact with the Vulcans. Once again they destroy the borg ship, but not before it severely damages the first warp drive ship being built, and also not before them manage to transport onto the Enterprise and begin to assimilate the crew. As such there are two plots running concurrently. On Earth the away crew, led by Riker and La Forge are racing against time to get the ship launched on schedule, and also attempt to convince an alcoholic Zephram Cochraine to go ahead with his warp drive test to alert the Vulcans to their presence. The second plot has the crew of the Enterprise, led by Picard, attempting to deal with the borg and to stop them from alerting other borg of their presences and the presence of Earth. After watching the entire season of Deep Space 9 I have come to really appreciate the Star Trek universe and some of the races that appear therein. Of course I always balk at this idea of a perfect, cashless, religionless, society where humans are always trying to better themselves. It just seems to be to be an unrealistic utopia that could never come about. Further, the whole idea that humans do not engage in conflict anymore seems to be silly, particularly when there is conflict within the episodes. Obviously the idea is to write off such humans as bad influences (such as the Marquis) and consider them destructive to the Federation. I did quite enjoy this movie, though it is one of those movies that you do need some familiarity with the series to at least understand the characters. When the film opens it is automatically assumed that the audience knows who the characters are, there is really no introduction. As such to viewer who is not familiar with the Star Trek franchise, it can be a little confusion. Personally, having watched Star Trek in the past and being familiar with many of the characters that make an appearance, the problem is not really so great for me, and it is also difficult to see it from an alternate point of view. What was also a little disappointing was that the only character that came back from Deep Space 9 for the movie was Worf, and I noted that the crew of the Defiant were pretty much nameless crew members. It would have been good to have at least seen Dax in the episode, or maybe some of the other characters, but I suspect that bringing characters across from Deep Space 9 may have added some more awkwardness to the movie that is not needed. In a way it sort of come across as part horror movie, as far as Star Trek can go with the horror genre. I suspect that is what they were trying to do with the Borg invasion of the Enterprise. First we have them scooting around the ventilation ducts as if it were an Alien movie, then we have the Borg Queen grafting skin onto Data to give him the sensation of humanity. In some horror films the concept of flesh plays a significant role, however in this film it is simply the representation of Data's desire to become more human. In the end he does sacrifice his new found skin, and sensation, to save the lives of his friends.

    People act like the Star Trek Reboot and its sequel are the only times Star Trek has veered into the genre of straight up action: Those people however seem to forget about this installment. Star Trek: First Contact's plot is that Captain Picard and the crew of the Enterprise must stop the Borg from altering history. Now, I'm going to let you know right off the bat that the plot is the weakest part.Despite it being well told, it contains numerous plot holes that are kind of hard not to notice. And yet, that is overshadowed by the great acting, smart dialogue, terrific special effects, and phenomenal action scenes. First Contact is also one of the darkest of the Star Trek films, and it works well as the pacing picks up and the film gets more and more intense to the point where you are on the edge of your seat. First Contact stands as the ONLY good Next Generation film, and it is even better than Wrath of Khan.

    Star Trek: First Contact is a great movie with a really well developed storyline that will both fans of Star Trek: The Next Generation and fans of sci-fi in general.It is the first standalone movie for the Next Generation crew,and it is much better than their first movie,Generations,that crossed them over with a few members of the original Star Trek crew,it was much better seeing this crew on their own instead of throwing in William Shatner.Like all Star Treks,the cast is fantastic,but there was just something extra special about this one,them seemed much ore positive than usual,they clearly knew it was a great script.Fans of Star Trek and just fans of sci-fi,because it has enough in it not to confuse people who aren't aware of Star Trek,will be very pleased with First Contact. Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) must battle against his old enemy the Borg,as they try to change history for the worse.

    I would say that this is the last great Trek film which resembles Gene Roddenberry's vision of the series. All the magic ingredients are there, the sense of family and interaction between the crew, the jeopardy, the message and even the ship, all come together to give us what Star Trek was all about in just under two hours. Special efx are great, Alice Krige as the Borg Queen somehow manages to be sexy and creepy at the same time, there is a wonderful scene between her and Data which also somehow manages to be highly erotic though the only flesh on show is Data's wrist.......... For me, I find it both sad and astonishing to see how quickly Star Trek burnt out with the next film, perhaps less could have been more and the franchise should have been rested after this last great film? What came next lost the magic and even JJ Abrams' offerings are Flatland 2D efforts in Roddenberry's 3D Trek universe; flat cardboard and wafer-thin plots with no substance, plot, message or wonder whatsoever.

    Star Trek: First Contact **1/2 (out of 4) 111 mins/ 12 Cast: Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, LeVar Burton, Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden, Marina Sirtis, Alfre Woodard, James Cromwell, Alice Krige, Neal McDonough Director: Jonathan Frakes Plot: The Enterprise D crew has to travel in time to face off against the evil Borg, who go way back with Captain Picard, as they try to prevent Earth's first contact with extra-terrestrial life. JJ's Verdict: Star Trek: First Contact starts off bold and proud with the theme tune playing over some well-made credits. With its reputation as the best Trek of them all, after reading the plot, you would expect bold and proud action that has a meaning to save the world. However, although we do get good action, it never seems through the camera or the characters eyes that they are fighting to save the universe and ends up just being about Picard fighting his demons and defeating the Borg for a personal achievement. In First Contact, the Enterprise crew are forced to time travel back to the mid-21st century as the Borg try to stop humans having first contact with aliens. We then find out that Captain Picard is dealing with demons once again because he was once taken in and transformed to become one of them. From here we get two groups of characters. The first are Riker and Geordi on Earth trying to make sure Zefram Cochran to fulfil his destiny and make first contact with aliens. Zefram is a cynical drunkard who is not too dissimilar to the character Dr. McCoy who was so loved by Trek fans back with the original crew. James Cromwell, portraying Cochran, brings a much needed freshness and quirkiness to the picture and gives us a very likable character. Back on the Enterprise we have an 'Alien' style survival against the Borg lead by Picard and Worf. Patrick Stewart, who of course plays Picard, once again brings his cool, commanding and cooling presence to the screen and if the state of the world really did depend on him, I'd be very happy indeed. All of these scenes have some great action and well-made chases but given its source material, feels a long way from the more human elements of the Original Crew's tenure. Sure, I love good action but it just doesn't feel like a 'Trek' film to me. Despite this, one scene at the start in which Picard disobeys orders from Starfleet is almost identical to one in Kirk and Co.'s final outing back in 1991 and feels awfully cringing. Another problem with the 'Alien' like scenes, are the aliens themselves, the Borg. Although Alice Krige puts in a creditable performance as the Borg, it is the Borg's motives which had me confused. To have power of the world, they are trying to stop human's first contact with aliens but surely, even if they stopped it then, there will be more opportunities to contact aliens. More Borg problems are that despite inhabiting their ship, the Borg will only kill the crew if they see them as a threat, and the crew will only kill the Borg if the Borg see the crew as a threat. Even when they are standing metres away form each other, they will only shoot if they sense that they are in danger. Why? I, unfortunately, cannot answer. The films visuals are the best out of all previous Trek films and so are the big-scoped space battles. More positives in the film are the dry wit in the script and great mix of seriousness and comic relief. However, this does have its downside because as the danger to Picard gets more serious, the comic relief given by James Cromwell increases which causes for a great sense of awkwardness as the two cut from one to another. Despite not being a 'Trek' film in the sense of the word, First Contact gives us an entertaining last twenty minutes, to be a decent but certainly watchable film.

    Star Trek: First Contact is widely considered to be 'The Wrath of Khan' of the New Generations films and rightly so. This film is a truly great film and to consider how it bounced back after 'Star Trek: Generations' is beyond me. Immediately into the film, we are told that Captain Picard, played by Patrick Stewart, was once assimilated by the Borg. News then breaks that a new Borg is prepared to attack Earth and the crew decide to disobey the orders of the Enterprise, with the android Data saying "To hell with our orders!" and so the Enterprise decide to help out a fleet that is attacked by the Borg. After the battle comes to an abrupt end, the Enterprise realize that the Borg has indeed used time travel to arrive at the day before aliens make first contact with Earth and must travel back in time to stop this from happening, which involves getting the creator of the Warp drive to activate it. I was extremely hesitant and afraid to watch this film, realizing how bad 'Generations' was. I could not take the pain of watching another bad Trek film, even when critics had stated it to be one of the best, I did not believe it! Thankfully, this is indeed one of the best and I personally rank it the second best. This opinion is subject to change once I do get to see JJ Abram's 2009 reboot but Star Trek: First Contact is an extremely interesting film with a far better written characters and story. Think back to 'Generations' when then android Data was simply making horrible jokes about an emotion chip that helps him understand jokes that were said years ago. Here, he is a far more interesting character and despite a few corny moments, Data is one of the highlights of the film. Take a look back at the villain in 'Generations' whose goal was to somehow travel back into the Nexus. Here, the villain is the Borg, possibly the coolest villain. First Contact also has the best action sequences in the series, up to date, and with a budget of $48 million, the film included great set pieces, possibly the best special effects up til now and was a commercial success, considering it made approximately 3 times its overall budget in the Box Office. The 'Star Trek' franchise suffers from often poor special effects, often tedious moments and corny dialogue that are only very limited in 'Wrath of Khan' and 'First Contact' The Borg were extremely interesting and intense villains and the Klingon Worf was extremely well done in the film. All the characters that were laughable in the previous entry to the Trek franchise have been re-done in a far more interesting way. The story itself is the best of the franchise and the visual effects and set piece have never looked better. A scene that stands out when referring to great set pieces for its time is the scene where Picard, Worf and the other officer are standing atop the Enterprise and attempting to thwart the plans of the Borg. Something interesting about this film is the direction they took with Data, whose motivations were clear: to be more human despite being a mechanical android. I love how the Borg gave him human skin and tried making him more human. That stuff worked very well in the film and gave another dimension to Data- something which 'Generations' utterly failed at. 'Star Trek: First Contact' is most definitely superior to 'Generations' and is the true introduction to the New Generations series. An extremely interesting premise is backed up by fantastic writing and directing, great action sequences and fantastic special effects. Quite possibly the best Trek film, along with 'Wrath of Khan' and a true surprise. Overall, this is one of the great Sci-Fi films.

    My wife and I watched the last 40 minutes of this movie on TV last night. She works for a production company that worked on "Into Darkness," and she had never seen any of the older Star Trek movies. I had seen "First Contact" when it came out in theaters, and I remembered that I really enjoyed it. At first I figured, "Well, I was a kid, and everything that involved space ships and lasers and explosions was cool back then." Boy, was I wrong. "First Contact" is not simply a sci-fi movie. In many ways, it is a movie about accepting responsibility and going the extra mile to do the right thing. Whether it's Picard refusing to abandon ship, or Data struggling to reject becoming a human (something he's always wanted), or Cochrane struggling to muster up the balls to test his FTL ship. Does it help to be a Star Trek fan? No, not really. It's not like they blindly reference old episodes from the show without any explanation - everything that happens is explained and easy to understand. Still, unlike JJ Abrams, this movie isn't dumbed down to encourage non-fans to give it a shot. I was surprised to find myself emotionally invested in the ending, especially after only tuning in over half-way through and having to explain several plot points to my wife (amazingly, I remembered MUCH more than I thought). And here's the crazy part, folks: you know how you can be flipping through the channels, come across a show or movie you haven't seen in a long time, it keeps your interest until the first commercial break, and then you change the channel? That didn't happen. My wife and I watched the whole damn thing - it kept our attention the entire time. And when a movie can do that, you know it's worth watching. I highly recommend this movie. I'll go so far as to say I think it's better than "Wrath of Khan." Yeah, I said it!

    In my opinion, this movie was pretty good. I love the analysis of Captain Jean Luc Picard's (Patrick Stewart) quest for revenge against the Borg being similar to Herman Melville's Moby Dick character Ahab whom in the book wanted revenge on a White Whale that took his leg. Six years ago, he was assimilation by the cybernetic Borg, and barely escape from it as shown in Star Trek: The Next Generation episode 'The Best of Both Worlds'. It's weird how there is two types of Picards. Picard here in the movie is like James T. Kirk, who acts in violence, disobey orders, and have pointless action scenes. In the TV series, Picard is a intelligent, mostly non-violence person who doesn't act upon violence unless it's a last resort. In the TV series, Picard was even nice to the Borgs choosing not to wipe them out when he had the chance because he believe that Borgs have the right to live. This belief happen after 'The Best of Both Worlds' episodes. Here in the movie, Picard is like I want to kill them all. Love the Holograph rampage that become a Internet meme later on. It's weird in a way, that the Federation was trying to stop Captain Jean Luc Picard from joining the Borg battle due to that reason. Despite him, knowing more about the enemy than anybody else in the Federation. I thought they would use him.In the past, at less in the Next Generation episodes, Picard was allowed to take control of three ships to kill the Borgs when they were trying to destroy a few space colonies. Anyways, Picard didn't follow the orders and join the fight against the Borgs in the beginning of the movie. Don't feel bad, Picard; the cast of Deep Space Nine wasn't invited despite USS Defiant being there. At less, the doctor from USS Voyager had a cameo in the film which was kinda funny. The Borgs were attacking Earth so they can assimilation them, but this is where the plot get confusing. The Borgs assimilates some, but allow others to live, because they don't find them a threat. By others- I meant people with guns.The writers of the movie wanted a story involving the Borgs, but the producer wanted a story involving time travel. The writers combined the two ideas; they initially set the film during the European Renaissance, but changed the time period the Borg corrupted to the mid-21st century after fearing the Renaissance idea would be too much like a bathetic novel. It would had been campy and over the top. Plus, Picard in tights wouldn't be a pretty sight. The entire plot doesn't make much sense, anyways. Rather than going to a remote part of space and time travel to Earth which would be safer for their Cube ship. They go near 24th century Earth where they were attack by hundreds of space ships. The cube ship is no shock destroy, as a Borg sphere ship escapes back into time in a worm hole which the USS Enterprise follows. The Enterprise arrives in the past, on April 4, 2063, the day before humanity's first contact with alien life after Zefram Cochrane's (James Cromwell) historic warp drive flight. James Cromwell was great and funny in the role. It's so unlike most of his serious dull roles that mostly follow his career. Still, it was a bit weird to see him play Cochrane and yet play other bit characters in the TV series such in the episodes 'The Hunted' and 'The Birth Right'. I just can't like Cochrane's assistant Lily Sloane (Alfre Woodard) because she always just in the way, and brings nothing to the table. Anyways the plot goes from assimilation them to now stopping first contact, which doesn't make any sense. If the humans never went to space the Borg would have never heard of them, so they wouldn't know they existed, so in a way, there would be erasing their history as well since there was no need to go to the Planet Earth. Plus, why are they assimilating them anyways? The Borg aren't primarily interested in humanity, a lesser species with unimpressive technology. They're making it seem that way, to attract the attention of the being they really want to assimilate says Q. Honestly, John de Lancie's omnipotent character Q was indeed in one of the first drafts of the screenplay. Anyways, the Borg Queen (Alice Krige) is probably my second favorite Star Trek villain besides Khan. She was pure evil. Alice was such a trooper. Krige suffered a large amount of discomfort filming her role; her costume was too tight, causing blisters, and the painful silver contact lenses she wore could only be kept in for four minutes at a time. Love the make up on her. The Borg were redesigned to appear as though they were converted into machine beings from the inside-out; the new makeup sessions took four times as long as on the television series. The supporting cast of the crew did what they can. Nothing worth saying about their acting. Commander Worf's (Michael Dorn) head still looks like a fanny. The special effect are great, surprising in the fact that Industrial Light & Magic rushed through it to complete the film's special effects in less than five months before the release date. The music is amazing, and yet another great job by Jerry Goldsmith. Love hearing Stepphenwolf 'Magic Carpet Ride" in the film. Director and cast member Jonathan Frakes AKA William Riker did a good job with his first film. Despite the sloppy writing and vague assumptions. I will admit the plot is full of holes, but I still really like this movie. There's a few inconsistencies, but they're forgivable with how great the action is. I know the Time Travel thing is a pretty bland idea, but overall this was quite an enjoyable film.

    The quintessential example of how a Star Trek movie should be done; (1) TNG cast are awesome (as usual), (2) The Enterprise has a new make over, (3) Beverley Crusher looking hotter than ever, (4) Great battle scenes, (5) Awesome new weapon with a cool name - Quantum torpedo, (6) The Borg - the best ST protagonist ever, (7) Witty dialogue and excellent character interactions (8) Troi was even decent !!! (9) The Borg Queen was fantastically portrayed (10) A truly awesome musical score.... .... what more is there to say? all but perfect! (The review is so concise and succinct that I have to add this to meet the minimum line requirements :P)

    The first movie spin-off from the Star Trek: Next Generation franchise felt like simply an extended double episode that was made for the big screen, and in a way I got the same impression with this film as well, even though I did enjoy it and enjoyed it somewhat the second time around. I have just finished watching all of the Deep Space 9 episodes and during that time I have been checking up a lot about the Star Trek universe on wikipedia, so when I read the entry for this movie I had a desire to watch it again. First Contact does come across like an extended episode, though no doubt it was more expensive that a simple episode. The crew returns with a new Enterprise (and new uniforms, which transfer over to Deep Space 9 at about the same time in the series). I am not sure where the other movies slip in though considering they seem to have been placed during the Dominion War. I do find it strange that we never see the new Enterprise E appearing in any of the later Deep Space 9 episodes, or even Picard making an appearance, considering that Starfleet's flagship would most likely be fighting on the front lines of what was quite a devastating war. The Borg have attacked Earth again, but the typical bureaucracy of Starfleet pushes Picard out to the Romulan Neutral Zone in case his previous encounters with the Borg may prove problematic to the defense of Earth. However, as is expected, Picard disobeys orders and returns to Earth just in time to destroy the ship. However it is not all over immediately as an escape pod is ejected and begins to travel back in time to the mid-21st century, and Picard orders his crew to follow it. This is where the title of the film comes in because they arrive a couple of days before Earth makes first contact with the Vulcans. Once again they destroy the borg ship, but not before it severely damages the first warp drive ship being built, and also not before them manage to transport onto the Enterprise and begin to assimilate the crew. As such there are two plots running concurrently. On Earth the away crew, led by Riker and La Forge are racing against time to get the ship launched on schedule, and also attempt to convince an alcoholic Zephram Cochraine to go ahead with his warp drive test to alert the Vulcans to their presence. The second plot has the crew of the Enterprise, led by Picard, attempting to deal with the borg and to stop them from alerting other borg of their presences and the presence of Earth. After watching the entire season of Deep Space 9 I have come to really appreciate the Star Trek universe and some of the races that appear therein. Of course I always balk at this idea of a perfect, cashless, religionless, society where humans are always trying to better themselves. It just seems to be to be an unrealistic utopia that could never come about. Further, the whole idea that humans do not engage in conflict anymore seems to be silly, particularly when there is conflict within the episodes. Obviously the idea is to write off such humans as bad influences (such as the Marquis) and consider them destructive to the Federation. I did quite enjoy this movie, though it is one of those movies that you do need some familiarity with the series to at least understand the characters. When the film opens it is automatically assumed that the audience knows who the characters are, there is really no introduction. As such to viewer who is not familiar with the Star Trek franchise, it can be a little confusion. Personally, having watched Star Trek in the past and being familiar with many of the characters that make an appearance, the problem is not really so great for me, and it is also difficult to see it from an alternate point of view. What was also a little disappointing was that the only character that came back from Deep Space 9 for the movie was Worf, and I noted that the crew of the Defiant were pretty much nameless crew members. It would have been good to have at least seen Dax in the episode, or maybe some of the other characters, but I suspect that bringing characters across from Deep Space 9 may have added some more awkwardness to the movie that is not needed. In a way it sort of come across as part horror movie, as far as Star Trek can go with the horror genre. I suspect that is what they were trying to do with the Borg invasion of the Enterprise. First we have them scooting around the ventilation ducts as if it were an Alien movie, then we have the Borg Queen grafting skin onto Data to give him the sensation of humanity. In some horror films the concept of flesh plays a significant role, however in this film it is simply the representation of Data's desire to become more human. In the end he does sacrifice his new found skin, and sensation, to save the lives of his friends.

    People act like the Star Trek Reboot and its sequel are the only times Star Trek has veered into the genre of straight up action: Those people however seem to forget about this installment. Star Trek: First Contact's plot is that Captain Picard and the crew of the Enterprise must stop the Borg from altering history. Now, I'm going to let you know right off the bat that the plot is the weakest part.Despite it being well told, it contains numerous plot holes that are kind of hard not to notice. And yet, that is overshadowed by the great acting, smart dialogue, terrific special effects, and phenomenal action scenes. First Contact is also one of the darkest of the Star Trek films, and it works well as the pacing picks up and the film gets more and more intense to the point where you are on the edge of your seat. First Contact stands as the ONLY good Next Generation film, and it is even better than Wrath of Khan.

    Star Trek: First Contact is a great movie with a really well developed storyline that will both fans of Star Trek: The Next Generation and fans of sci-fi in general.It is the first standalone movie for the Next Generation crew,and it is much better than their first movie,Generations,that crossed them over with a few members of the original Star Trek crew,it was much better seeing this crew on their own instead of throwing in William Shatner.Like all Star Treks,the cast is fantastic,but there was just something extra special about this one,them seemed much ore positive than usual,they clearly knew it was a great script.Fans of Star Trek and just fans of sci-fi,because it has enough in it not to confuse people who aren't aware of Star Trek,will be very pleased with First Contact. Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) must battle against his old enemy the Borg,as they try to change history for the worse.

    I would say that this is the last great Trek film which resembles Gene Roddenberry's vision of the series. All the magic ingredients are there, the sense of family and interaction between the crew, the jeopardy, the message and even the ship, all come together to give us what Star Trek was all about in just under two hours. Special efx are great, Alice Krige as the Borg Queen somehow manages to be sexy and creepy at the same time, there is a wonderful scene between her and Data which also somehow manages to be highly erotic though the only flesh on show is Data's wrist.......... For me, I find it both sad and astonishing to see how quickly Star Trek burnt out with the next film, perhaps less could have been more and the franchise should have been rested after this last great film? What came next lost the magic and even JJ Abrams' offerings are Flatland 2D efforts in Roddenberry's 3D Trek universe; flat cardboard and wafer-thin plots with no substance, plot, message or wonder whatsoever.

    Star Trek: First Contact **1/2 (out of 4) 111 mins/ 12 Cast: Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, LeVar Burton, Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden, Marina Sirtis, Alfre Woodard, James Cromwell, Alice Krige, Neal McDonough Director: Jonathan Frakes Plot: The Enterprise D crew has to travel in time to face off against the evil Borg, who go way back with Captain Picard, as they try to prevent Earth's first contact with extra-terrestrial life. JJ's Verdict: Star Trek: First Contact starts off bold and proud with the theme tune playing over some well-made credits. With its reputation as the best Trek of them all, after reading the plot, you would expect bold and proud action that has a meaning to save the world. However, although we do get good action, it never seems through the camera or the characters eyes that they are fighting to save the universe and ends up just being about Picard fighting his demons and defeating the Borg for a personal achievement. In First Contact, the Enterprise crew are forced to time travel back to the mid-21st century as the Borg try to stop humans having first contact with aliens. We then find out that Captain Picard is dealing with demons once again because he was once taken in and transformed to become one of them. From here we get two groups of characters. The first are Riker and Geordi on Earth trying to make sure Zefram Cochran to fulfil his destiny and make first contact with aliens. Zefram is a cynical drunkard who is not too dissimilar to the character Dr. McCoy who was so loved by Trek fans back with the original crew. James Cromwell, portraying Cochran, brings a much needed freshness and quirkiness to the picture and gives us a very likable character. Back on the Enterprise we have an 'Alien' style survival against the Borg lead by Picard and Worf. Patrick Stewart, who of course plays Picard, once again brings his cool, commanding and cooling presence to the screen and if the state of the world really did depend on him, I'd be very happy indeed. All of these scenes have some great action and well-made chases but given its source material, feels a long way from the more human elements of the Original Crew's tenure. Sure, I love good action but it just doesn't feel like a 'Trek' film to me. Despite this, one scene at the start in which Picard disobeys orders from Starfleet is almost identical to one in Kirk and Co.'s final outing back in 1991 and feels awfully cringing. Another problem with the 'Alien' like scenes, are the aliens themselves, the Borg. Although Alice Krige puts in a creditable performance as the Borg, it is the Borg's motives which had me confused. To have power of the world, they are trying to stop human's first contact with aliens but surely, even if they stopped it then, there will be more opportunities to contact aliens. More Borg problems are that despite inhabiting their ship, the Borg will only kill the crew if they see them as a threat, and the crew will only kill the Borg if the Borg see the crew as a threat. Even when they are standing metres away form each other, they will only shoot if they sense that they are in danger. Why? I, unfortunately, cannot answer. The films visuals are the best out of all previous Trek films and so are the big-scoped space battles. More positives in the film are the dry wit in the script and great mix of seriousness and comic relief. However, this does have its downside because as the danger to Picard gets more serious, the comic relief given by James Cromwell increases which causes for a great sense of awkwardness as the two cut from one to another. Despite not being a 'Trek' film in the sense of the word, First Contact gives us an entertaining last twenty minutes, to be a decent but certainly watchable film.

    Star Trek: First Contact is widely considered to be 'The Wrath of Khan' of the New Generations films and rightly so. This film is a truly great film and to consider how it bounced back after 'Star Trek: Generations' is beyond me. Immediately into the film, we are told that Captain Picard, played by Patrick Stewart, was once assimilated by the Borg. News then breaks that a new Borg is prepared to attack Earth and the crew decide to disobey the orders of the Enterprise, with the android Data saying "To hell with our orders!" and so the Enterprise decide to help out a fleet that is attacked by the Borg. After the battle comes to an abrupt end, the Enterprise realize that the Borg has indeed used time travel to arrive at the day before aliens make first contact with Earth and must travel back in time to stop this from happening, which involves getting the creator of the Warp drive to activate it. I was extremely hesitant and afraid to watch this film, realizing how bad 'Generations' was. I could not take the pain of watching another bad Trek film, even when critics had stated it to be one of the best, I did not believe it! Thankfully, this is indeed one of the best and I personally rank it the second best. This opinion is subject to change once I do get to see JJ Abram's 2009 reboot but Star Trek: First Contact is an extremely interesting film with a far better written characters and story. Think back to 'Generations' when then android Data was simply making horrible jokes about an emotion chip that helps him understand jokes that were said years ago. Here, he is a far more interesting character and despite a few corny moments, Data is one of the highlights of the film. Take a look back at the villain in 'Generations' whose goal was to somehow travel back into the Nexus. Here, the villain is the Borg, possibly the coolest villain. First Contact also has the best action sequences in the series, up to date, and with a budget of $48 million, the film included great set pieces, possibly the best special effects up til now and was a commercial success, considering it made approximately 3 times its overall budget in the Box Office. The 'Star Trek' franchise suffers from often poor special effects, often tedious moments and corny dialogue that are only very limited in 'Wrath of Khan' and 'First Contact' The Borg were extremely interesting and intense villains and the Klingon Worf was extremely well done in the film. All the characters that were laughable in the previous entry to the Trek franchise have been re-done in a far more interesting way. The story itself is the best of the franchise and the visual effects and set piece have never looked better. A scene that stands out when referring to great set pieces for its time is the scene where Picard, Worf and the other officer are standing atop the Enterprise and attempting to thwart the plans of the Borg. Something interesting about this film is the direction they took with Data, whose motivations were clear: to be more human despite being a mechanical android. I love how the Borg gave him human skin and tried making him more human. That stuff worked very well in the film and gave another dimension to Data- something which 'Generations' utterly failed at. 'Star Trek: First Contact' is most definitely superior to 'Generations' and is the true introduction to the New Generations series. An extremely interesting premise is backed up by fantastic writing and directing, great action sequences and fantastic special effects. Quite possibly the best Trek film, along with 'Wrath of Khan' and a true surprise. Overall, this is one of the great Sci-Fi films.

    My wife and I watched the last 40 minutes of this movie on TV last night. She works for a production company that worked on "Into Darkness," and she had never seen any of the older Star Trek movies. I had seen "First Contact" when it came out in theaters, and I remembered that I really enjoyed it. At first I figured, "Well, I was a kid, and everything that involved space ships and lasers and explosions was cool back then." Boy, was I wrong. "First Contact" is not simply a sci-fi movie. In many ways, it is a movie about accepting responsibility and going the extra mile to do the right thing. Whether it's Picard refusing to abandon ship, or Data struggling to reject becoming a human (something he's always wanted), or Cochrane struggling to muster up the balls to test his FTL ship. Does it help to be a Star Trek fan? No, not really. It's not like they blindly reference old episodes from the show without any explanation - everything that happens is explained and easy to understand. Still, unlike JJ Abrams, this movie isn't dumbed down to encourage non-fans to give it a shot. I was surprised to find myself emotionally invested in the ending, especially after only tuning in over half-way through and having to explain several plot points to my wife (amazingly, I remembered MUCH more than I thought). And here's the crazy part, folks: you know how you can be flipping through the channels, come across a show or movie you haven't seen in a long time, it keeps your interest until the first commercial break, and then you change the channel? That didn't happen. My wife and I watched the whole damn thing - it kept our attention the entire time. And when a movie can do that, you know it's worth watching. I highly recommend this movie. I'll go so far as to say I think it's better than "Wrath of Khan." Yeah, I said it!

    In my opinion, this movie was pretty good. I love the analysis of Captain Jean Luc Picard's (Patrick Stewart) quest for revenge against the Borg being similar to Herman Melville's Moby Dick character Ahab whom in the book wanted revenge on a White Whale that took his leg. Six years ago, he was assimilation by the cybernetic Borg, and barely escape from it as shown in Star Trek: The Next Generation episode 'The Best of Both Worlds'. It's weird how there is two types of Picards. Picard here in the movie is like James T. Kirk, who acts in violence, disobey orders, and have pointless action scenes. In the TV series, Picard is a intelligent, mostly non-violence person who doesn't act upon violence unless it's a last resort. In the TV series, Picard was even nice to the Borgs choosing not to wipe them out when he had the chance because he believe that Borgs have the right to live. This belief happen after 'The Best of Both Worlds' episodes. Here in the movie, Picard is like I want to kill them all. Love the Holograph rampage that become a Internet meme later on. It's weird in a way, that the Federation was trying to stop Captain Jean Luc Picard from joining the Borg battle due to that reason. Despite him, knowing more about the enemy than anybody else in the Federation. I thought they would use him.In the past, at less in the Next Generation episodes, Picard was allowed to take control of three ships to kill the Borgs when they were trying to destroy a few space colonies. Anyways, Picard didn't follow the orders and join the fight against the Borgs in the beginning of the movie. Don't feel bad, Picard; the cast of Deep Space Nine wasn't invited despite USS Defiant being there. At less, the doctor from USS Voyager had a cameo in the film which was kinda funny. The Borgs were attacking Earth so they can assimilation them, but this is where the plot get confusing. The Borgs assimilates some, but allow others to live, because they don't find them a threat. By others- I meant people with guns.The writers of the movie wanted a story involving the Borgs, but the producer wanted a story involving time travel. The writers combined the two ideas; they initially set the film during the European Renaissance, but changed the time period the Borg corrupted to the mid-21st century after fearing the Renaissance idea would be too much like a bathetic novel. It would had been campy and over the top. Plus, Picard in tights wouldn't be a pretty sight. The entire plot doesn't make much sense, anyways. Rather than going to a remote part of space and time travel to Earth which would be safer for their Cube ship. They go near 24th century Earth where they were attack by hundreds of space ships. The cube ship is no shock destroy, as a Borg sphere ship escapes back into time in a worm hole which the USS Enterprise follows. The Enterprise arrives in the past, on April 4, 2063, the day before humanity's first contact with alien life after Zefram Cochrane's (James Cromwell) historic warp drive flight. James Cromwell was great and funny in the role. It's so unlike most of his serious dull roles that mostly follow his career. Still, it was a bit weird to see him play Cochrane and yet play other bit characters in the TV series such in the episodes 'The Hunted' and 'The Birth Right'. I just can't like Cochrane's assistant Lily Sloane (Alfre Woodard) because she always just in the way, and brings nothing to the table. Anyways the plot goes from assimilation them to now stopping first contact, which doesn't make any sense. If the humans never went to space the Borg would have never heard of them, so they wouldn't know they existed, so in a way, there would be erasing their history as well since there was no need to go to the Planet Earth. Plus, why are they assimilating them anyways? The Borg aren't primarily interested in humanity, a lesser species with unimpressive technology. They're making it seem that way, to attract the attention of the being they really want to assimilate says Q. Honestly, John de Lancie's omnipotent character Q was indeed in one of the first drafts of the screenplay. Anyways, the Borg Queen (Alice Krige) is probably my second favorite Star Trek villain besides Khan. She was pure evil. Alice was such a trooper. Krige suffered a large amount of discomfort filming her role; her costume was too tight, causing blisters, and the painful silver contact lenses she wore could only be kept in for four minutes at a time. Love the make up on her. The Borg were redesigned to appear as though they were converted into machine beings from the inside-out; the new makeup sessions took four times as long as on the television series. The supporting cast of the crew did what they can. Nothing worth saying about their acting. Commander Worf's (Michael Dorn) head still looks like a fanny. The special effect are great, surprising in the fact that Industrial Light & Magic rushed through it to complete the film's special effects in less than five months before the release date. The music is amazing, and yet another great job by Jerry Goldsmith. Love hearing Stepphenwolf 'Magic Carpet Ride" in the film. Director and cast member Jonathan Frakes AKA William Riker did a good job with his first film. Despite the sloppy writing and vague assumptions. I will admit the plot is full of holes, but I still really like this movie. There's a few inconsistencies, but they're forgivable with how great the action is. I know the Time Travel thing is a pretty bland idea, but overall this was quite an enjoyable film.

    The quintessential example of how a Star Trek movie should be done; (1) TNG cast are awesome (as usual), (2) The Enterprise has a new make over, (3) Beverley Crusher looking hotter than ever, (4) Great battle scenes, (5) Awesome new weapon with a cool name - Quantum torpedo, (6) The Borg - the best ST protagonist ever, (7) Witty dialogue and excellent character interactions (8) Troi was even decent !!! (9) The Borg Queen was fantastically portrayed (10) A truly awesome musical score.... .... what more is there to say? all but perfect! (The review is so concise and succinct that I have to add this to meet the minimum line requirements :P)

    The first movie spin-off from the Star Trek: Next Generation franchise felt like simply an extended double episode that was made for the big screen, and in a way I got the same impression with this film as well, even though I did enjoy it and enjoyed it somewhat the second time around. I have just finished watching all of the Deep Space 9 episodes and during that time I have been checking up a lot about the Star Trek universe on wikipedia, so when I read the entry for this movie I had a desire to watch it again. First Contact does come across like an extended episode, though no doubt it was more expensive that a simple episode. The crew returns with a new Enterprise (and new uniforms, which transfer over to Deep Space 9 at about the same time in the series). I am not sure where the other movies slip in though considering they seem to have been placed during the Dominion War. I do find it strange that we never see the new Enterprise E appearing in any of the later Deep Space 9 episodes, or even Picard making an appearance, considering that Starfleet's flagship would most likely be fighting on the front lines of what was quite a devastating war. The Borg have attacked Earth again, but the typical bureaucracy of Starfleet pushes Picard out to the Romulan Neutral Zone in case his previous encounters with the Borg may prove problematic to the defense of Earth. However, as is expected, Picard disobeys orders and returns to Earth just in time to destroy the ship. However it is not all over immediately as an escape pod is ejected and begins to travel back in time to the mid-21st century, and Picard orders his crew to follow it. This is where the title of the film comes in because they arrive a couple of days before Earth makes first contact with the Vulcans. Once again they destroy the borg ship, but not before it severely damages the first warp drive ship being built, and also not before them manage to transport onto the Enterprise and begin to assimilate the crew. As such there are two plots running concurrently. On Earth the away crew, led by Riker and La Forge are racing against time to get the ship launched on schedule, and also attempt to convince an alcoholic Zephram Cochraine to go ahead with his warp drive test to alert the Vulcans to their presence. The second plot has the crew of the Enterprise, led by Picard, attempting to deal with the borg and to stop them from alerting other borg of their presences and the presence of Earth. After watching the entire season of Deep Space 9 I have come to really appreciate the Star Trek universe and some of the races that appear therein. Of course I always balk at this idea of a perfect, cashless, religionless, society where humans are always trying to better themselves. It just seems to be to be an unrealistic utopia that could never come about. Further, the whole idea that humans do not engage in conflict anymore seems to be silly, particularly when there is conflict within the episodes. Obviously the idea is to write off such humans as bad influences (such as the Marquis) and consider them destructive to the Federation. I did quite enjoy this movie, though it is one of those movies that you do need some familiarity with the series to at least understand the characters. When the film opens it is automatically assumed that the audience knows who the characters are, there is really no introduction. As such to viewer who is not familiar with the Star Trek franchise, it can be a little confusion. Personally, having watched Star Trek in the past and being familiar with many of the characters that make an appearance, the problem is not really so great for me, and it is also difficult to see it from an alternate point of view. What was also a little disappointing was that the only character that came back from Deep Space 9 for the movie was Worf, and I noted that the crew of the Defiant were pretty much nameless crew members. It would have been good to have at least seen Dax in the episode, or maybe some of the other characters, but I suspect that bringing characters across from Deep Space 9 may have added some more awkwardness to the movie that is not needed. In a way it sort of come across as part horror movie, as far as Star Trek can go with the horror genre. I suspect that is what they were trying to do with the Borg invasion of the Enterprise. First we have them scooting around the ventilation ducts as if it were an Alien movie, then we have the Borg Queen grafting skin onto Data to give him the sensation of humanity. In some horror films the concept of flesh plays a significant role, however in this film it is simply the representation of Data's desire to become more human. In the end he does sacrifice his new found skin, and sensation, to save the lives of his friends.

    People act like the Star Trek Reboot and its sequel are the only times Star Trek has veered into the genre of straight up action: Those people however seem to forget about this installment. Star Trek: First Contact's plot is that Captain Picard and the crew of the Enterprise must stop the Borg from altering history. Now, I'm going to let you know right off the bat that the plot is the weakest part.Despite it being well told, it contains numerous plot holes that are kind of hard not to notice. And yet, that is overshadowed by the great acting, smart dialogue, terrific special effects, and phenomenal action scenes. First Contact is also one of the darkest of the Star Trek films, and it works well as the pacing picks up and the film gets more and more intense to the point where you are on the edge of your seat. First Contact stands as the ONLY good Next Generation film, and it is even better than Wrath of Khan.

    Star Trek: First Contact is a great movie with a really well developed storyline that will both fans of Star Trek: The Next Generation and fans of sci-fi in general.It is the first standalone movie for the Next Generation crew,and it is much better than their first movie,Generations,that crossed them over with a few members of the original Star Trek crew,it was much better seeing this crew on their own instead of throwing in William Shatner.Like all Star Treks,the cast is fantastic,but there was just something extra special about this one,them seemed much ore positive than usual,they clearly knew it was a great script.Fans of Star Trek and just fans of sci-fi,because it has enough in it not to confuse people who aren't aware of Star Trek,will be very pleased with First Contact. Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) must battle against his old enemy the Borg,as they try to change history for the worse.

    I would say that this is the last great Trek film which resembles Gene Roddenberry's vision of the series. All the magic ingredients are there, the sense of family and interaction between the crew, the jeopardy, the message and even the ship, all come together to give us what Star Trek was all about in just under two hours. Special efx are great, Alice Krige as the Borg Queen somehow manages to be sexy and creepy at the same time, there is a wonderful scene between her and Data which also somehow manages to be highly erotic though the only flesh on show is Data's wrist.......... For me, I find it both sad and astonishing to see how quickly Star Trek burnt out with the next film, perhaps less could have been more and the franchise should have been rested after this last great film? What came next lost the magic and even JJ Abrams' offerings are Flatland 2D efforts in Roddenberry's 3D Trek universe; flat cardboard and wafer-thin plots with no substance, plot, message or wonder whatsoever.

    Star Trek: First Contact **1/2 (out of 4) 111 mins/ 12 Cast: Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, LeVar Burton, Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden, Marina Sirtis, Alfre Woodard, James Cromwell, Alice Krige, Neal McDonough Director: Jonathan Frakes Plot: The Enterprise D crew has to travel in time to face off against the evil Borg, who go way back with Captain Picard, as they try to prevent Earth's first contact with extra-terrestrial life. JJ's Verdict: Star Trek: First Contact starts off bold and proud with the theme tune playing over some well-made credits. With its reputation as the best Trek of them all, after reading the plot, you would expect bold and proud action that has a meaning to save the world. However, although we do get good action, it never seems through the camera or the characters eyes that they are fighting to save the universe and ends up just being about Picard fighting his demons and defeating the Borg for a personal achievement. In First Contact, the Enterprise crew are forced to time travel back to the mid-21st century as the Borg try to stop humans having first contact with aliens. We then find out that Captain Picard is dealing with demons once again because he was once taken in and transformed to become one of them. From here we get two groups of characters. The first are Riker and Geordi on Earth trying to make sure Zefram Cochran to fulfil his destiny and make first contact with aliens. Zefram is a cynical drunkard who is not too dissimilar to the character Dr. McCoy who was so loved by Trek fans back with the original crew. James Cromwell, portraying Cochran, brings a much needed freshness and quirkiness to the picture and gives us a very likable character. Back on the Enterprise we have an 'Alien' style survival against the Borg lead by Picard and Worf. Patrick Stewart, who of course plays Picard, once again brings his cool, commanding and cooling presence to the screen and if the state of the world really did depend on him, I'd be very happy indeed. All of these scenes have some great action and well-made chases but given its source material, feels a long way from the more human elements of the Original Crew's tenure. Sure, I love good action but it just doesn't feel like a 'Trek' film to me. Despite this, one scene at the start in which Picard disobeys orders from Starfleet is almost identical to one in Kirk and Co.'s final outing back in 1991 and feels awfully cringing. Another problem with the 'Alien' like scenes, are the aliens themselves, the Borg. Although Alice Krige puts in a creditable performance as the Borg, it is the Borg's motives which had me confused. To have power of the world, they are trying to stop human's first contact with aliens but surely, even if they stopped it then, there will be more opportunities to contact aliens. More Borg problems are that despite inhabiting their ship, the Borg will only kill the crew if they see them as a threat, and the crew will only kill the Borg if the Borg see the crew as a threat. Even when they are standing metres away form each other, they will only shoot if they sense that they are in danger. Why? I, unfortunately, cannot answer. The films visuals are the best out of all previous Trek films and so are the big-scoped space battles. More positives in the film are the dry wit in the script and great mix of seriousness and comic relief. However, this does have its downside because as the danger to Picard gets more serious, the comic relief given by James Cromwell increases which causes for a great sense of awkwardness as the two cut from one to another. Despite not being a 'Trek' film in the sense of the word, First Contact gives us an entertaining last twenty minutes, to be a decent but certainly watchable film.

    Star Trek: First Contact is widely considered to be 'The Wrath of Khan' of the New Generations films and rightly so. This film is a truly great film and to consider how it bounced back after 'Star Trek: Generations' is beyond me. Immediately into the film, we are told that Captain Picard, played by Patrick Stewart, was once assimilated by the Borg. News then breaks that a new Borg is prepared to attack Earth and the crew decide to disobey the orders of the Enterprise, with the android Data saying "To hell with our orders!" and so the Enterprise decide to help out a fleet that is attacked by the Borg. After the battle comes to an abrupt end, the Enterprise realize that the Borg has indeed used time travel to arrive at the day before aliens make first contact with Earth and must travel back in time to stop this from happening, which involves getting the creator of the Warp drive to activate it. I was extremely hesitant and afraid to watch this film, realizing how bad 'Generations' was. I could not take the pain of watching another bad Trek film, even when critics had stated it to be one of the best, I did not believe it! Thankfully, this is indeed one of the best and I personally rank it the second best. This opinion is subject to change once I do get to see JJ Abram's 2009 reboot but Star Trek: First Contact is an extremely interesting film with a far better written characters and story. Think back to 'Generations' when then android Data was simply making horrible jokes about an emotion chip that helps him understand jokes that were said years ago. Here, he is a far more interesting character and despite a few corny moments, Data is one of the highlights of the film. Take a look back at the villain in 'Generations' whose goal was to somehow travel back into the Nexus. Here, the villain is the Borg, possibly the coolest villain. First Contact also has the best action sequences in the series, up to date, and with a budget of $48 million, the film included great set pieces, possibly the best special effects up til now and was a commercial success, considering it made approximately 3 times its overall budget in the Box Office. The 'Star Trek' franchise suffers from often poor special effects, often tedious moments and corny dialogue that are only very limited in 'Wrath of Khan' and 'First Contact' The Borg were extremely interesting and intense villains and the Klingon Worf was extremely well done in the film. All the characters that were laughable in the previous entry to the Trek franchise have been re-done in a far more interesting way. The story itself is the best of the franchise and the visual effects and set piece have never looked better. A scene that stands out when referring to great set pieces for its time is the scene where Picard, Worf and the other officer are standing atop the Enterprise and attempting to thwart the plans of the Borg. Something interesting about this film is the direction they took with Data, whose motivations were clear: to be more human despite being a mechanical android. I love how the Borg gave him human skin and tried making him more human. That stuff worked very well in the film and gave another dimension to Data- something which 'Generations' utterly failed at. 'Star Trek: First Contact' is most definitely superior to 'Generations' and is the true introduction to the New Generations series. An extremely interesting premise is backed up by fantastic writing and directing, great action sequences and fantastic special effects. Quite possibly the best Trek film, along with 'Wrath of Khan' and a true surprise. Overall, this is one of the great Sci-Fi films.

    My wife and I watched the last 40 minutes of this movie on TV last night. She works for a production company that worked on "Into Darkness," and she had never seen any of the older Star Trek movies. I had seen "First Contact" when it came out in theaters, and I remembered that I really enjoyed it. At first I figured, "Well, I was a kid, and everything that involved space ships and lasers and explosions was cool back then." Boy, was I wrong. "First Contact" is not simply a sci-fi movie. In many ways, it is a movie about accepting responsibility and going the extra mile to do the right thing. Whether it's Picard refusing to abandon ship, or Data struggling to reject becoming a human (something he's always wanted), or Cochrane struggling to muster up the balls to test his FTL ship. Does it help to be a Star Trek fan? No, not really. It's not like they blindly reference old episodes from the show without any explanation - everything that happens is explained and easy to understand. Still, unlike JJ Abrams, this movie isn't dumbed down to encourage non-fans to give it a shot. I was surprised to find myself emotionally invested in the ending, especially after only tuning in over half-way through and having to explain several plot points to my wife (amazingly, I remembered MUCH more than I thought). And here's the crazy part, folks: you know how you can be flipping through the channels, come across a show or movie you haven't seen in a long time, it keeps your interest until the first commercial break, and then you change the channel? That didn't happen. My wife and I watched the whole damn thing - it kept our attention the entire time. And when a movie can do that, you know it's worth watching. I highly recommend this movie. I'll go so far as to say I think it's better than "Wrath of Khan." Yeah, I said it!

    In my opinion, this movie was pretty good. I love the analysis of Captain Jean Luc Picard's (Patrick Stewart) quest for revenge against the Borg being similar to Herman Melville's Moby Dick character Ahab whom in the book wanted revenge on a White Whale that took his leg. Six years ago, he was assimilation by the cybernetic Borg, and barely escape from it as shown in Star Trek: The Next Generation episode 'The Best of Both Worlds'. It's weird how there is two types of Picards. Picard here in the movie is like James T. Kirk, who acts in violence, disobey orders, and have pointless action scenes. In the TV series, Picard is a intelligent, mostly non-violence person who doesn't act upon violence unless it's a last resort. In the TV series, Picard was even nice to the Borgs choosing not to wipe them out when he had the chance because he believe that Borgs have the right to live. This belief happen after 'The Best of Both Worlds' episodes. Here in the movie, Picard is like I want to kill them all. Love the Holograph rampage that become a Internet meme later on. It's weird in a way, that the Federation was trying to stop Captain Jean Luc Picard from joining the Borg battle due to that reason. Despite him, knowing more about the enemy than anybody else in the Federation. I thought they would use him.In the past, at less in the Next Generation episodes, Picard was allowed to take control of three ships to kill the Borgs when they were trying to destroy a few space colonies. Anyways, Picard didn't follow the orders and join the fight against the Borgs in the beginning of the movie. Don't feel bad, Picard; the cast of Deep Space Nine wasn't invited despite USS Defiant being there. At less, the doctor from USS Voyager had a cameo in the film which was kinda funny. The Borgs were attacking Earth so they can assimilation them, but this is where the plot get confusing. The Borgs assimilates some, but allow others to live, because they don't find them a threat. By others- I meant people with guns.The writers of the movie wanted a story involving the Borgs, but the producer wanted a story involving time travel. The writers combined the two ideas; they initially set the film during the European Renaissance, but changed the time period the Borg corrupted to the mid-21st century after fearing the Renaissance idea would be too much like a bathetic novel. It would had been campy and over the top. Plus, Picard in tights wouldn't be a pretty sight. The entire plot doesn't make much sense, anyways. Rather than going to a remote part of space and time travel to Earth which would be safer for their Cube ship. They go near 24th century Earth where they were attack by hundreds of space ships. The cube ship is no shock destroy, as a Borg sphere ship escapes back into time in a worm hole which the USS Enterprise follows. The Enterprise arrives in the past, on April 4, 2063, the day before humanity's first contact with alien life after Zefram Cochrane's (James Cromwell) historic warp drive flight. James Cromwell was great and funny in the role. It's so unlike most of his serious dull roles that mostly follow his career. Still, it was a bit weird to see him play Cochrane and yet play other bit characters in the TV series such in the episodes 'The Hunted' and 'The Birth Right'. I just can't like Cochrane's assistant Lily Sloane (Alfre Woodard) because she always just in the way, and brings nothing to the table. Anyways the plot goes from assimilation them to now stopping first contact, which doesn't make any sense. If the humans never went to space the Borg would have never heard of them, so they wouldn't know they existed, so in a way, there would be erasing their history as well since there was no need to go to the Planet Earth. Plus, why are they assimilating them anyways? The Borg aren't primarily interested in humanity, a lesser species with unimpressive technology. They're making it seem that way, to attract the attention of the being they really want to assimilate says Q. Honestly, John de Lancie's omnipotent character Q was indeed in one of the first drafts of the screenplay. Anyways, the Borg Queen (Alice Krige) is probably my second favorite Star Trek villain besides Khan. She was pure evil. Alice was such a trooper. Krige suffered a large amount of discomfort filming her role; her costume was too tight, causing blisters, and the painful silver contact lenses she wore could only be kept in for four minutes at a time. Love the make up on her. The Borg were redesigned to appear as though they were converted into machine beings from the inside-out; the new makeup sessions took four times as long as on the television series. The supporting cast of the crew did what they can. Nothing worth saying about their acting. Commander Worf's (Michael Dorn) head still looks like a fanny. The special effect are great, surprising in the fact that Industrial Light & Magic rushed through it to complete the film's special effects in less than five months before the release date. The music is amazing, and yet another great job by Jerry Goldsmith. Love hearing Stepphenwolf 'Magic Carpet Ride" in the film. Director and cast member Jonathan Frakes AKA William Riker did a good job with his first film. Despite the sloppy writing and vague assumptions. I will admit the plot is full of holes, but I still really like this movie. There's a few inconsistencies, but they're forgivable with how great the action is. I know the Time Travel thing is a pretty bland idea, but overall this was quite an enjoyable film.

    The first movie spin-off from the Star Trek: Next Generation franchise felt like simply an extended double episode that was made for the big screen, and in a way I got the same impression with this film as well, even though I did enjoy it and enjoyed it somewhat the second time around. I have just finished watching all of the Deep Space 9 episodes and during that time I have been checking up a lot about the Star Trek universe on wikipedia, so when I read the entry for this movie I had a desire to watch it again. First Contact does come across like an extended episode, though no doubt it was more expensive that a simple episode. The crew returns with a new Enterprise (and new uniforms, which transfer over to Deep Space 9 at about the same time in the series). I am not sure where the other movies slip in though considering they seem to have been placed during the Dominion War. I do find it strange that we never see the new Enterprise E appearing in any of the later Deep Space 9 episodes, or even Picard making an appearance, considering that Starfleet's flagship would most likely be fighting on the front lines of what was quite a devastating war. The Borg have attacked Earth again, but the typical bureaucracy of Starfleet pushes Picard out to the Romulan Neutral Zone in case his previous encounters with the Borg may prove problematic to the defense of Earth. However, as is expected, Picard disobeys orders and returns to Earth just in time to destroy the ship. However it is not all over immediately as an escape pod is ejected and begins to travel back in time to the mid-21st century, and Picard orders his crew to follow it. This is where the title of the film comes in because they arrive a couple of days before Earth makes first contact with the Vulcans. Once again they destroy the borg ship, but not before it severely damages the first warp drive ship being built, and also not before them manage to transport onto the Enterprise and begin to assimilate the crew. As such there are two plots running concurrently. On Earth the away crew, led by Riker and La Forge are racing against time to get the ship launched on schedule, and also attempt to convince an alcoholic Zephram Cochraine to go ahead with his warp drive test to alert the Vulcans to their presence. The second plot has the crew of the Enterprise, led by Picard, attempting to deal with the borg and to stop them from alerting other borg of their presences and the presence of Earth. After watching the entire season of Deep Space 9 I have come to really appreciate the Star Trek universe and some of the races that appear therein. Of course I always balk at this idea of a perfect, cashless, religionless, society where humans are always trying to better themselves. It just seems to be to be an unrealistic utopia that could never come about. Further, the whole idea that humans do not engage in conflict anymore seems to be silly, particularly when there is conflict within the episodes. Obviously the idea is to write off such humans as bad influences (such as the Marquis) and consider them destructive to the Federation. I did quite enjoy this movie, though it is one of those movies that you do need some familiarity with the series to at least understand the characters. When the film opens it is automatically assumed that the audience knows who the characters are, there is really no introduction. As such to viewer who is not familiar with the Star Trek franchise, it can be a little confusion. Personally, having watched Star Trek in the past and being familiar with many of the characters that make an appearance, the problem is not really so great for me, and it is also difficult to see it from an alternate point of view. What was also a little disappointing was that the only character that came back from Deep Space 9 for the movie was Worf, and I noted that the crew of the Defiant were pretty much nameless crew members. It would have been good to have at least seen Dax in the episode, or maybe some of the other characters, but I suspect that bringing characters across from Deep Space 9 may have added some more awkwardness to the movie that is not needed. In a way it sort of come across as part horror movie, as far as Star Trek can go with the horror genre. I suspect that is what they were trying to do with the Borg invasion of the Enterprise. First we have them scooting around the ventilation ducts as if it were an Alien movie, then we have the Borg Queen grafting skin onto Data to give him the sensation of humanity. In some horror films the concept of flesh plays a significant role, however in this film it is simply the representation of Data's desire to become more human. In the end he does sacrifice his new found skin, and sensation, to save the lives of his friends.

    People act like the Star Trek Reboot and its sequel are the only times Star Trek has veered into the genre of straight up action: Those people however seem to forget about this installment. Star Trek: First Contact's plot is that Captain Picard and the crew of the Enterprise must stop the Borg from altering history. Now, I'm going to let you know right off the bat that the plot is the weakest part.Despite it being well told, it contains numerous plot holes that are kind of hard not to notice. And yet, that is overshadowed by the great acting, smart dialogue, terrific special effects, and phenomenal action scenes. First Contact is also one of the darkest of the Star Trek films, and it works well as the pacing picks up and the film gets more and more intense to the point where you are on the edge of your seat. First Contact stands as the ONLY good Next Generation film, and it is even better than Wrath of Khan.

    Star Trek: First Contact is a great movie with a really well developed storyline that will both fans of Star Trek: The Next Generation and fans of sci-fi in general.It is the first standalone movie for the Next Generation crew,and it is much better than their first movie,Generations,that crossed them over with a few members of the original Star Trek crew,it was much better seeing this crew on their own instead of throwing in William Shatner.Like all Star Treks,the cast is fantastic,but there was just something extra special about this one,them seemed much ore positive than usual,they clearly knew it was a great script.Fans of Star Trek and just fans of sci-fi,because it has enough in it not to confuse people who aren't aware of Star Trek,will be very pleased with First Contact. Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) must battle against his old enemy the Borg,as they try to change history for the worse.

    I would say that this is the last great Trek film which resembles Gene Roddenberry's vision of the series. All the magic ingredients are there, the sense of family and interaction between the crew, the jeopardy, the message and even the ship, all come together to give us what Star Trek was all about in just under two hours. Special efx are great, Alice Krige as the Borg Queen somehow manages to be sexy and creepy at the same time, there is a wonderful scene between her and Data which also somehow manages to be highly erotic though the only flesh on show is Data's wrist.......... For me, I find it both sad and astonishing to see how quickly Star Trek burnt out with the next film, perhaps less could have been more and the franchise should have been rested after this last great film? What came next lost the magic and even JJ Abrams' offerings are Flatland 2D efforts in Roddenberry's 3D Trek universe; flat cardboard and wafer-thin plots with no substance, plot, message or wonder whatsoever.

    Star Trek: First Contact **1/2 (out of 4) 111 mins/ 12 Cast: Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, LeVar Burton, Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden, Marina Sirtis, Alfre Woodard, James Cromwell, Alice Krige, Neal McDonough Director: Jonathan Frakes Plot: The Enterprise D crew has to travel in time to face off against the evil Borg, who go way back with Captain Picard, as they try to prevent Earth's first contact with extra-terrestrial life. JJ's Verdict: Star Trek: First Contact starts off bold and proud with the theme tune playing over some well-made credits. With its reputation as the best Trek of them all, after reading the plot, you would expect bold and proud action that has a meaning to save the world. However, although we do get good action, it never seems through the camera or the characters eyes that they are fighting to save the universe and ends up just being about Picard fighting his demons and defeating the Borg for a personal achievement. In First Contact, the Enterprise crew are forced to time travel back to the mid-21st century as the Borg try to stop humans having first contact with aliens. We then find out that Captain Picard is dealing with demons once again because he was once taken in and transformed to become one of them. From here we get two groups of characters. The first are Riker and Geordi on Earth trying to make sure Zefram Cochran to fulfil his destiny and make first contact with aliens. Zefram is a cynical drunkard who is not too dissimilar to the character Dr. McCoy who was so loved by Trek fans back with the original crew. James Cromwell, portraying Cochran, brings a much needed freshness and quirkiness to the picture and gives us a very likable character. Back on the Enterprise we have an 'Alien' style survival against the Borg lead by Picard and Worf. Patrick Stewart, who of course plays Picard, once again brings his cool, commanding and cooling presence to the screen and if the state of the world really did depend on him, I'd be very happy indeed. All of these scenes have some great action and well-made chases but given its source material, feels a long way from the more human elements of the Original Crew's tenure. Sure, I love good action but it just doesn't feel like a 'Trek' film to me. Despite this, one scene at the start in which Picard disobeys orders from Starfleet is almost identical to one in Kirk and Co.'s final outing back in 1991 and feels awfully cringing. Another problem with the 'Alien' like scenes, are the aliens themselves, the Borg. Although Alice Krige puts in a creditable performance as the Borg, it is the Borg's motives which had me confused. To have power of the world, they are trying to stop human's first contact with aliens but surely, even if they stopped it then, there will be more opportunities to contact aliens. More Borg problems are that despite inhabiting their ship, the Borg will only kill the crew if they see them as a threat, and the crew will only kill the Borg if the Borg see the crew as a threat. Even when they are standing metres away form each other, they will only shoot if they sense that they are in danger. Why? I, unfortunately, cannot answer. The films visuals are the best out of all previous Trek films and so are the big-scoped space battles. More positives in the film are the dry wit in the script and great mix of seriousness and comic relief. However, this does have its downside because as the danger to Picard gets more serious, the comic relief given by James Cromwell increases which causes for a great sense of awkwardness as the two cut from one to another. Despite not being a 'Trek' film in the sense of the word, First Contact gives us an entertaining last twenty minutes, to be a decent but certainly watchable film.

    Star Trek: First Contact is widely considered to be 'The Wrath of Khan' of the New Generations films and rightly so. This film is a truly great film and to consider how it bounced back after 'Star Trek: Generations' is beyond me. Immediately into the film, we are told that Captain Picard, played by Patrick Stewart, was once assimilated by the Borg. News then breaks that a new Borg is prepared to attack Earth and the crew decide to disobey the orders of the Enterprise, with the android Data saying "To hell with our orders!" and so the Enterprise decide to help out a fleet that is attacked by the Borg. After the battle comes to an abrupt end, the Enterprise realize that the Borg has indeed used time travel to arrive at the day before aliens make first contact with Earth and must travel back in time to stop this from happening, which involves getting the creator of the Warp drive to activate it. I was extremely hesitant and afraid to watch this film, realizing how bad 'Generations' was. I could not take the pain of watching another bad Trek film, even when critics had stated it to be one of the best, I did not believe it! Thankfully, this is indeed one of the best and I personally rank it the second best. This opinion is subject to change once I do get to see JJ Abram's 2009 reboot but Star Trek: First Contact is an extremely interesting film with a far better written characters and story. Think back to 'Generations' when then android Data was simply making horrible jokes about an emotion chip that helps him understand jokes that were said years ago. Here, he is a far more interesting character and despite a few corny moments, Data is one of the highlights of the film. Take a look back at the villain in 'Generations' whose goal was to somehow travel back into the Nexus. Here, the villain is the Borg, possibly the coolest villain. First Contact also has the best action sequences in the series, up to date, and with a budget of $48 million, the film included great set pieces, possibly the best special effects up til now and was a commercial success, considering it made approximately 3 times its overall budget in the Box Office. The 'Star Trek' franchise suffers from often poor special effects, often tedious moments and corny dialogue that are only very limited in 'Wrath of Khan' and 'First Contact' The Borg were extremely interesting and intense villains and the Klingon Worf was extremely well done in the film. All the characters that were laughable in the previous entry to the Trek franchise have been re-done in a far more interesting way. The story itself is the best of the franchise and the visual effects and set piece have never looked better. A scene that stands out when referring to great set pieces for its time is the scene where Picard, Worf and the other officer are standing atop the Enterprise and attempting to thwart the plans of the Borg. Something interesting about this film is the direction they took with Data, whose motivations were clear: to be more human despite being a mechanical android. I love how the Borg gave him human skin and tried making him more human. That stuff worked very well in the film and gave another dimension to Data- something which 'Generations' utterly failed at. 'Star Trek: First Contact' is most definitely superior to 'Generations' and is the true introduction to the New Generations series. An extremely interesting premise is backed up by fantastic writing and directing, great action sequences and fantastic special effects. Quite possibly the best Trek film, along with 'Wrath of Khan' and a true surprise. Overall, this is one of the great Sci-Fi films.

    My wife and I watched the last 40 minutes of this movie on TV last night. She works for a production company that worked on "Into Darkness," and she had never seen any of the older Star Trek movies. I had seen "First Contact" when it came out in theaters, and I remembered that I really enjoyed it. At first I figured, "Well, I was a kid, and everything that involved space ships and lasers and explosions was cool back then." Boy, was I wrong. "First Contact" is not simply a sci-fi movie. In many ways, it is a movie about accepting responsibility and going the extra mile to do the right thing. Whether it's Picard refusing to abandon ship, or Data struggling to reject becoming a human (something he's always wanted), or Cochrane struggling to muster up the balls to test his FTL ship. Does it help to be a Star Trek fan? No, not really. It's not like they blindly reference old episodes from the show without any explanation - everything that happens is explained and easy to understand. Still, unlike JJ Abrams, this movie isn't dumbed down to encourage non-fans to give it a shot. I was surprised to find myself emotionally invested in the ending, especially after only tuning in over half-way through and having to explain several plot points to my wife (amazingly, I remembered MUCH more than I thought). And here's the crazy part, folks: you know how you can be flipping through the channels, come across a show or movie you haven't seen in a long time, it keeps your interest until the first commercial break, and then you change the channel? That didn't happen. My wife and I watched the whole damn thing - it kept our attention the entire time. And when a movie can do that, you know it's worth watching. I highly recommend this movie. I'll go so far as to say I think it's better than "Wrath of Khan." Yeah, I said it!

    In my opinion, this movie was pretty good. I love the analysis of Captain Jean Luc Picard's (Patrick Stewart) quest for revenge against the Borg being similar to Herman Melville's Moby Dick character Ahab whom in the book wanted revenge on a White Whale that took his leg. Six years ago, he was assimilation by the cybernetic Borg, and barely escape from it as shown in Star Trek: The Next Generation episode 'The Best of Both Worlds'. It's weird how there is two types of Picards. Picard here in the movie is like James T. Kirk, who acts in violence, disobey orders, and have pointless action scenes. In the TV series, Picard is a intelligent, mostly non-violence person who doesn't act upon violence unless it's a last resort. In the TV series, Picard was even nice to the Borgs choosing not to wipe them out when he had the chance because he believe that Borgs have the right to live. This belief happen after 'The Best of Both Worlds' episodes. Here in the movie, Picard is like I want to kill them all. Love the Holograph rampage that become a Internet meme later on. It's weird in a way, that the Federation was trying to stop Captain Jean Luc Picard from joining the Borg battle due to that reason. Despite him, knowing more about the enemy than anybody else in the Federation. I thought they would use him.In the past, at less in the Next Generation episodes, Picard was allowed to take control of three ships to kill the Borgs when they were trying to destroy a few space colonies. Anyways, Picard didn't follow the orders and join the fight against the Borgs in the beginning of the movie. Don't feel bad, Picard; the cast of Deep Space Nine wasn't invited despite USS Defiant being there. At less, the doctor from USS Voyager had a cameo in the film which was kinda funny. The Borgs were attacking Earth so they can assimilation them, but this is where the plot get confusing. The Borgs assimilates some, but allow others to live, because they don't find them a threat. By others- I meant people with guns.The writers of the movie wanted a story involving the Borgs, but the producer wanted a story involving time travel. The writers combined the two ideas; they initially set the film during the European Renaissance, but changed the time period the Borg corrupted to the mid-21st century after fearing the Renaissance idea would be too much like a bathetic novel. It would had been campy and over the top. Plus, Picard in tights wouldn't be a pretty sight. The entire plot doesn't make much sense, anyways. Rather than going to a remote part of space and time travel to Earth which would be safer for their Cube ship. They go near 24th century Earth where they were attack by hundreds of space ships. The cube ship is no shock destroy, as a Borg sphere ship escapes back into time in a worm hole which the USS Enterprise follows. The Enterprise arrives in the past, on April 4, 2063, the day before humanity's first contact with alien life after Zefram Cochrane's (James Cromwell) historic warp drive flight. James Cromwell was great and funny in the role. It's so unlike most of his serious dull roles that mostly follow his career. Still, it was a bit weird to see him play Cochrane and yet play other bit characters in the TV series such in the episodes 'The Hunted' and 'The Birth Right'. I just can't like Cochrane's assistant Lily Sloane (Alfre Woodard) because she always just in the way, and brings nothing to the table. Anyways the plot goes from assimilation them to now stopping first contact, which doesn't make any sense. If the humans never went to space the Borg would have never heard of them, so they wouldn't know they existed, so in a way, there would be erasing their history as well since there was no need to go to the Planet Earth. Plus, why are they assimilating them anyways? The Borg aren't primarily interested in humanity, a lesser species with unimpressive technology. They're making it seem that way, to attract the attention of the being they really want to assimilate says Q. Honestly, John de Lancie's omnipotent character Q was indeed in one of the first drafts of the screenplay. Anyways, the Borg Queen (Alice Krige) is probably my second favorite Star Trek villain besides Khan. She was pure evil. Alice was such a trooper. Krige suffered a large amount of discomfort filming her role; her costume was too tight, causing blisters, and the painful silver contact lenses she wore could only be kept in for four minutes at a time. Love the make up on her. The Borg were redesigned to appear as though they were converted into machine beings from the inside-out; the new makeup sessions took four times as long as on the television series. The supporting cast of the crew did what they can. Nothing worth saying about their acting. Commander Worf's (Michael Dorn) head still looks like a fanny. The special effect are great, surprising in the fact that Industrial Light & Magic rushed through it to complete the film's special effects in less than five months before the release date. The music is amazing, and yet another great job by Jerry Goldsmith. Love hearing Stepphenwolf 'Magic Carpet Ride" in the film. Director and cast member Jonathan Frakes AKA William Riker did a good job with his first film. Despite the sloppy writing and vague assumptions. I will admit the plot is full of holes, but I still really like this movie. There's a few inconsistencies, but they're forgivable with how great the action is. I know the Time Travel thing is a pretty bland idea, but overall this was quite an enjoyable film.

    The quintessential example of how a Star Trek movie should be done; (1) TNG cast are awesome (as usual), (2) The Enterprise has a new make over, (3) Beverley Crusher looking hotter than ever, (4) Great battle scenes, (5) Awesome new weapon with a cool name - Quantum torpedo, (6) The Borg - the best ST protagonist ever, (7) Witty dialogue and excellent character interactions (8) Troi was even decent !!! (9) The Borg Queen was fantastically portrayed (10) A truly awesome musical score.... .... what more is there to say? all but perfect! (The review is so concise and succinct that I have to add this to meet the minimum line requirements :P)

    The first movie spin-off from the Star Trek: Next Generation franchise felt like simply an extended double episode that was made for the big screen, and in a way I got the same impression with this film as well, even though I did enjoy it and enjoyed it somewhat the second time around. I have just finished watching all of the Deep Space 9 episodes and during that time I have been checking up a lot about the Star Trek universe on wikipedia, so when I read the entry for this movie I had a desire to watch it again. First Contact does come across like an extended episode, though no doubt it was more expensive that a simple episode. The crew returns with a new Enterprise (and new uniforms, which transfer over to Deep Space 9 at about the same time in the series). I am not sure where the other movies slip in though considering they seem to have been placed during the Dominion War. I do find it strange that we never see the new Enterprise E appearing in any of the later Deep Space 9 episodes, or even Picard making an appearance, considering that Starfleet's flagship would most likely be fighting on the front lines of what was quite a devastating war. The Borg have attacked Earth again, but the typical bureaucracy of Starfleet pushes Picard out to the Romulan Neutral Zone in case his previous encounters with the Borg may prove problematic to the defense of Earth. However, as is expected, Picard disobeys orders and returns to Earth just in time to destroy the ship. However it is not all over immediately as an escape pod is ejected and begins to travel back in time to the mid-21st century, and Picard orders his crew to follow it. This is where the title of the film comes in because they arrive a couple of days before Earth makes first contact with the Vulcans. Once again they destroy the borg ship, but not before it severely damages the first warp drive ship being built, and also not before them manage to transport onto the Enterprise and begin to assimilate the crew. As such there are two plots running concurrently. On Earth the away crew, led by Riker and La Forge are racing against time to get the ship launched on schedule, and also attempt to convince an alcoholic Zephram Cochraine to go ahead with his warp drive test to alert the Vulcans to their presence. The second plot has the crew of the Enterprise, led by Picard, attempting to deal with the borg and to stop them from alerting other borg of their presences and the presence of Earth. After watching the entire season of Deep Space 9 I have come to really appreciate the Star Trek universe and some of the races that appear therein. Of course I always balk at this idea of a perfect, cashless, religionless, society where humans are always trying to better themselves. It just seems to be to be an unrealistic utopia that could never come about. Further, the whole idea that humans do not engage in conflict anymore seems to be silly, particularly when there is conflict within the episodes. Obviously the idea is to write off such humans as bad influences (such as the Marquis) and consider them destructive to the Federation. I did quite enjoy this movie, though it is one of those movies that you do need some familiarity with the series to at least understand the characters. When the film opens it is automatically assumed that the audience knows who the characters are, there is really no introduction. As such to viewer who is not familiar with the Star Trek franchise, it can be a little confusion. Personally, having watched Star Trek in the past and being familiar with many of the characters that make an appearance, the problem is not really so great for me, and it is also difficult to see it from an alternate point of view. What was also a little disappointing was that the only character that came back from Deep Space 9 for the movie was Worf, and I noted that the crew of the Defiant were pretty much nameless crew members. It would have been good to have at least seen Dax in the episode, or maybe some of the other characters, but I suspect that bringing characters across from Deep Space 9 may have added some more awkwardness to the movie that is not needed. In a way it sort of come across as part horror movie, as far as Star Trek can go with the horror genre. I suspect that is what they were trying to do with the Borg invasion of the Enterprise. First we have them scooting around the ventilation ducts as if it were an Alien movie, then we have the Borg Queen grafting skin onto Data to give him the sensation of humanity. In some horror films the concept of flesh plays a significant role, however in this film it is simply the representation of Data's desire to become more human. In the end he does sacrifice his new found skin, and sensation, to save the lives of his friends.

    People act like the Star Trek Reboot and its sequel are the only times Star Trek has veered into the genre of straight up action: Those people however seem to forget about this installment. Star Trek: First Contact's plot is that Captain Picard and the crew of the Enterprise must stop the Borg from altering history. Now, I'm going to let you know right off the bat that the plot is the weakest part.Despite it being well told, it contains numerous plot holes that are kind of hard not to notice. And yet, that is overshadowed by the great acting, smart dialogue, terrific special effects, and phenomenal action scenes. First Contact is also one of the darkest of the Star Trek films, and it works well as the pacing picks up and the film gets more and more intense to the point where you are on the edge of your seat. First Contact stands as the ONLY good Next Generation film, and it is even better than Wrath of Khan.

    Star Trek: First Contact is a great movie with a really well developed storyline that will both fans of Star Trek: The Next Generation and fans of sci-fi in general.It is the first standalone movie for the Next Generation crew,and it is much better than their first movie,Generations,that crossed them over with a few members of the original Star Trek crew,it was much better seeing this crew on their own instead of throwing in William Shatner.Like all Star Treks,the cast is fantastic,but there was just something extra special about this one,them seemed much ore positive than usual,they clearly knew it was a great script.Fans of Star Trek and just fans of sci-fi,because it has enough in it not to confuse people who aren't aware of Star Trek,will be very pleased with First Contact. Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) must battle against his old enemy the Borg,as they try to change history for the worse.

    I would say that this is the last great Trek film which resembles Gene Roddenberry's vision of the series. All the magic ingredients are there, the sense of family and interaction between the crew, the jeopardy, the message and even the ship, all come together to give us what Star Trek was all about in just under two hours. Special efx are great, Alice Krige as the Borg Queen somehow manages to be sexy and creepy at the same time, there is a wonderful scene between her and Data which also somehow manages to be highly erotic though the only flesh on show is Data's wrist.......... For me, I find it both sad and astonishing to see how quickly Star Trek burnt out with the next film, perhaps less could have been more and the franchise should have been rested after this last great film? What came next lost the magic and even JJ Abrams' offerings are Flatland 2D efforts in Roddenberry's 3D Trek universe; flat cardboard and wafer-thin plots with no substance, plot, message or wonder whatsoever.

    Star Trek: First Contact **1/2 (out of 4) 111 mins/ 12 Cast: Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, LeVar Burton, Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden, Marina Sirtis, Alfre Woodard, James Cromwell, Alice Krige, Neal McDonough Director: Jonathan Frakes Plot: The Enterprise D crew has to travel in time to face off against the evil Borg, who go way back with Captain Picard, as they try to prevent Earth's first contact with extra-terrestrial life. JJ's Verdict: Star Trek: First Contact starts off bold and proud with the theme tune playing over some well-made credits. With its reputation as the best Trek of them all, after reading the plot, you would expect bold and proud action that has a meaning to save the world. However, although we do get good action, it never seems through the camera or the characters eyes that they are fighting to save the universe and ends up just being about Picard fighting his demons and defeating the Borg for a personal achievement. In First Contact, the Enterprise crew are forced to time travel back to the mid-21st century as the Borg try to stop humans having first contact with aliens. We then find out that Captain Picard is dealing with demons once again because he was once taken in and transformed to become one of them. From here we get two groups of characters. The first are Riker and Geordi on Earth trying to make sure Zefram Cochran to fulfil his destiny and make first contact with aliens. Zefram is a cynical drunkard who is not too dissimilar to the character Dr. McCoy who was so loved by Trek fans back with the original crew. James Cromwell, portraying Cochran, brings a much needed freshness and quirkiness to the picture and gives us a very likable character. Back on the Enterprise we have an 'Alien' style survival against the Borg lead by Picard and Worf. Patrick Stewart, who of course plays Picard, once again brings his cool, commanding and cooling presence to the screen and if the state of the world really did depend on him, I'd be very happy indeed. All of these scenes have some great action and well-made chases but given its source material, feels a long way from the more human elements of the Original Crew's tenure. Sure, I love good action but it just doesn't feel like a 'Trek' film to me. Despite this, one scene at the start in which Picard disobeys orders from Starfleet is almost identical to one in Kirk and Co.'s final outing back in 1991 and feels awfully cringing. Another problem with the 'Alien' like scenes, are the aliens themselves, the Borg. Although Alice Krige puts in a creditable performance as the Borg, it is the Borg's motives which had me confused. To have power of the world, they are trying to stop human's first contact with aliens but surely, even if they stopped it then, there will be more opportunities to contact aliens. More Borg problems are that despite inhabiting their ship, the Borg will only kill the crew if they see them as a threat, and the crew will only kill the Borg if the Borg see the crew as a threat. Even when they are standing metres away form each other, they will only shoot if they sense that they are in danger. Why? I, unfortunately, cannot answer. The films visuals are the best out of all previous Trek films and so are the big-scoped space battles. More positives in the film are the dry wit in the script and great mix of seriousness and comic relief. However, this does have its downside because as the danger to Picard gets more serious, the comic relief given by James Cromwell increases which causes for a great sense of awkwardness as the two cut from one to another. Despite not being a 'Trek' film in the sense of the word, First Contact gives us an entertaining last twenty minutes, to be a decent but certainly watchable film.

    Star Trek: First Contact is widely considered to be 'The Wrath of Khan' of the New Generations films and rightly so. This film is a truly great film and to consider how it bounced back after 'Star Trek: Generations' is beyond me. Immediately into the film, we are told that Captain Picard, played by Patrick Stewart, was once assimilated by the Borg. News then breaks that a new Borg is prepared to attack Earth and the crew decide to disobey the orders of the Enterprise, with the android Data saying "To hell with our orders!" and so the Enterprise decide to help out a fleet that is attacked by the Borg. After the battle comes to an abrupt end, the Enterprise realize that the Borg has indeed used time travel to arrive at the day before aliens make first contact with Earth and must travel back in time to stop this from happening, which involves getting the creator of the Warp drive to activate it. I was extremely hesitant and afraid to watch this film, realizing how bad 'Generations' was. I could not take the pain of watching another bad Trek film, even when critics had stated it to be one of the best, I did not believe it! Thankfully, this is indeed one of the best and I personally rank it the second best. This opinion is subject to change once I do get to see JJ Abram's 2009 reboot but Star Trek: First Contact is an extremely interesting film with a far better written characters and story. Think back to 'Generations' when then android Data was simply making horrible jokes about an emotion chip that helps him understand jokes that were said years ago. Here, he is a far more interesting character and despite a few corny moments, Data is one of the highlights of the film. Take a look back at the villain in 'Generations' whose goal was to somehow travel back into the Nexus. Here, the villain is the Borg, possibly the coolest villain. First Contact also has the best action sequences in the series, up to date, and with a budget of $48 million, the film included great set pieces, possibly the best special effects up til now and was a commercial success, considering it made approximately 3 times its overall budget in the Box Office. The 'Star Trek' franchise suffers from often poor special effects, often tedious moments and corny dialogue that are only very limited in 'Wrath of Khan' and 'First Contact' The Borg were extremely interesting and intense villains and the Klingon Worf was extremely well done in the film. All the characters that were laughable in the previous entry to the Trek franchise have been re-done in a far more interesting way. The story itself is the best of the franchise and the visual effects and set piece have never looked better. A scene that stands out when referring to great set pieces for its time is the scene where Picard, Worf and the other officer are standing atop the Enterprise and attempting to thwart the plans of the Borg. Something interesting about this film is the direction they took with Data, whose motivations were clear: to be more human despite being a mechanical android. I love how the Borg gave him human skin and tried making him more human. That stuff worked very well in the film and gave another dimension to Data- something which 'Generations' utterly failed at. 'Star Trek: First Contact' is most definitely superior to 'Generations' and is the true introduction to the New Generations series. An extremely interesting premise is backed up by fantastic writing and directing, great action sequences and fantastic special effects. Quite possibly the best Trek film, along with 'Wrath of Khan' and a true surprise. Overall, this is one of the great Sci-Fi films.

    My wife and I watched the last 40 minutes of this movie on TV last night. She works for a production company that worked on "Into Darkness," and she had never seen any of the older Star Trek movies. I had seen "First Contact" when it came out in theaters, and I remembered that I really enjoyed it. At first I figured, "Well, I was a kid, and everything that involved space ships and lasers and explosions was cool back then." Boy, was I wrong. "First Contact" is not simply a sci-fi movie. In many ways, it is a movie about accepting responsibility and going the extra mile to do the right thing. Whether it's Picard refusing to abandon ship, or Data struggling to reject becoming a human (something he's always wanted), or Cochrane struggling to muster up the balls to test his FTL ship. Does it help to be a Star Trek fan? No, not really. It's not like they blindly reference old episodes from the show without any explanation - everything that happens is explained and easy to understand. Still, unlike JJ Abrams, this movie isn't dumbed down to encourage non-fans to give it a shot. I was surprised to find myself emotionally invested in the ending, especially after only tuning in over half-way through and having to explain several plot points to my wife (amazingly, I remembered MUCH more than I thought). And here's the crazy part, folks: you know how you can be flipping through the channels, come across a show or movie you haven't seen in a long time, it keeps your interest until the first commercial break, and then you change the channel? That didn't happen. My wife and I watched the whole damn thing - it kept our attention the entire time. And when a movie can do that, you know it's worth watching. I highly recommend this movie. I'll go so far as to say I think it's better than "Wrath of Khan." Yeah, I said it!

    In my opinion, this movie was pretty good. I love the analysis of Captain Jean Luc Picard's (Patrick Stewart) quest for revenge against the Borg being similar to Herman Melville's Moby Dick character Ahab whom in the book wanted revenge on a White Whale that took his leg. Six years ago, he was assimilation by the cybernetic Borg, and barely escape from it as shown in Star Trek: The Next Generation episode 'The Best of Both Worlds'. It's weird how there is two types of Picards. Picard here in the movie is like James T. Kirk, who acts in violence, disobey orders, and have pointless action scenes. In the TV series, Picard is a intelligent, mostly non-violence person who doesn't act upon violence unless it's a last resort. In the TV series, Picard was even nice to the Borgs choosing not to wipe them out when he had the chance because he believe that Borgs have the right to live. This belief happen after 'The Best of Both Worlds' episodes. Here in the movie, Picard is like I want to kill them all. Love the Holograph rampage that become a Internet meme later on. It's weird in a way, that the Federation was trying to stop Captain Jean Luc Picard from joining the Borg battle due to that reason. Despite him, knowing more about the enemy than anybody else in the Federation. I thought they would use him.In the past, at less in the Next Generation episodes, Picard was allowed to take control of three ships to kill the Borgs when they were trying to destroy a few space colonies. Anyways, Picard didn't follow the orders and join the fight against the Borgs in the beginning of the movie. Don't feel bad, Picard; the cast of Deep Space Nine wasn't invited despite USS Defiant being there. At less, the doctor from USS Voyager had a cameo in the film which was kinda funny. The Borgs were attacking Earth so they can assimilation them, but this is where the plot get confusing. The Borgs assimilates some, but allow others to live, because they don't find them a threat. By others- I meant people with guns.The writers of the movie wanted a story involving the Borgs, but the producer wanted a story involving time travel. The writers combined the two ideas; they initially set the film during the European Renaissance, but changed the time period the Borg corrupted to the mid-21st century after fearing the Renaissance idea would be too much like a bathetic novel. It would had been campy and over the top. Plus, Picard in tights wouldn't be a pretty sight. The entire plot doesn't make much sense, anyways. Rather than going to a remote part of space and time travel to Earth which would be safer for their Cube ship. They go near 24th century Earth where they were attack by hundreds of space ships. The cube ship is no shock destroy, as a Borg sphere ship escapes back into time in a worm hole which the USS Enterprise follows. The Enterprise arrives in the past, on April 4, 2063, the day before humanity's first contact with alien life after Zefram Cochrane's (James Cromwell) historic warp drive flight. James Cromwell was great and funny in the role. It's so unlike most of his serious dull roles that mostly follow his career. Still, it was a bit weird to see him play Cochrane and yet play other bit characters in the TV series such in the episodes 'The Hunted' and 'The Birth Right'. I just can't like Cochrane's assistant Lily Sloane (Alfre Woodard) because she always just in the way, and brings nothing to the table. Anyways the plot goes from assimilation them to now stopping first contact, which doesn't make any sense. If the humans never went to space the Borg would have never heard of them, so they wouldn't know they existed, so in a way, there would be erasing their history as well since there was no need to go to the Planet Earth. Plus, why are they assimilating them anyways? The Borg aren't primarily interested in humanity, a lesser species with unimpressive technology. They're making it seem that way, to attract the attention of the being they really want to assimilate says Q. Honestly, John de Lancie's omnipotent character Q was indeed in one of the first drafts of the screenplay. Anyways, the Borg Queen (Alice Krige) is probably my second favorite Star Trek villain besides Khan. She was pure evil. Alice was such a trooper. Krige suffered a large amount of discomfort filming her role; her costume was too tight, causing blisters, and the painful silver contact lenses she wore could only be kept in for four minutes at a time. Love the make up on her. The Borg were redesigned to appear as though they were converted into machine beings from the inside-out; the new makeup sessions took four times as long as on the television series. The supporting cast of the crew did what they can. Nothing worth saying about their acting. Commander Worf's (Michael Dorn) head still looks like a fanny. The special effect are great, surprising in the fact that Industrial Light & Magic rushed through it to complete the film's special effects in less than five months before the release date. The music is amazing, and yet another great job by Jerry Goldsmith. Love hearing Stepphenwolf 'Magic Carpet Ride" in the film. Director and cast member Jonathan Frakes AKA William Riker did a good job with his first film. Despite the sloppy writing and vague assumptions. I will admit the plot is full of holes, but I still really like this movie. There's a few inconsistencies, but they're forgivable with how great the action is. I know the Time Travel thing is a pretty bland idea, but overall this was quite an enjoyable film.

    The quintessential example of how a Star Trek movie should be done; (1) TNG cast are awesome (as usual), (2) The Enterprise has a new make over, (3) Beverley Crusher looking hotter than ever, (4) Great battle scenes, (5) Awesome new weapon with a cool name - Quantum torpedo, (6) The Borg - the best ST protagonist ever, (7) Witty dialogue and excellent character interactions (8) Troi was even decent !!! (9) The Borg Queen was fantastically portrayed (10) A truly awesome musical score.... .... what more is there to say? all but perfect! (The review is so concise and succinct that I have to add this to meet the minimum line requirements :P)

    The first movie spin-off from the Star Trek: Next Generation franchise felt like simply an extended double episode that was made for the big screen, and in a way I got the same impression with this film as well, even though I did enjoy it and enjoyed it somewhat the second time around. I have just finished watching all of the Deep Space 9 episodes and during that time I have been checking up a lot about the Star Trek universe on wikipedia, so when I read the entry for this movie I had a desire to watch it again. First Contact does come across like an extended episode, though no doubt it was more expensive that a simple episode. The crew returns with a new Enterprise (and new uniforms, which transfer over to Deep Space 9 at about the same time in the series). I am not sure where the other movies slip in though considering they seem to have been placed during the Dominion War. I do find it strange that we never see the new Enterprise E appearing in any of the later Deep Space 9 episodes, or even Picard making an appearance, considering that Starfleet's flagship would most likely be fighting on the front lines of what was quite a devastating war. The Borg have attacked Earth again, but the typical bureaucracy of Starfleet pushes Picard out to the Romulan Neutral Zone in case his previous encounters with the Borg may prove problematic to the defense of Earth. However, as is expected, Picard disobeys orders and returns to Earth just in time to destroy the ship. However it is not all over immediately as an escape pod is ejected and begins to travel back in time to the mid-21st century, and Picard orders his crew to follow it. This is where the title of the film comes in because they arrive a couple of days before Earth makes first contact with the Vulcans. Once again they destroy the borg ship, but not before it severely damages the first warp drive ship being built, and also not before them manage to transport onto the Enterprise and begin to assimilate the crew. As such there are two plots running concurrently. On Earth the away crew, led by Riker and La Forge are racing against time to get the ship launched on schedule, and also attempt to convince an alcoholic Zephram Cochraine to go ahead with his warp drive test to alert the Vulcans to their presence. The second plot has the crew of the Enterprise, led by Picard, attempting to deal with the borg and to stop them from alerting other borg of their presences and the presence of Earth. After watching the entire season of Deep Space 9 I have come to really appreciate the Star Trek universe and some of the races that appear therein. Of course I always balk at this idea of a perfect, cashless, religionless, society where humans are always trying to better themselves. It just seems to be to be an unrealistic utopia that could never come about. Further, the whole idea that humans do not engage in conflict anymore seems to be silly, particularly when there is conflict within the episodes. Obviously the idea is to write off such humans as bad influences (such as the Marquis) and consider them destructive to the Federation. I did quite enjoy this movie, though it is one of those movies that you do need some familiarity with the series to at least understand the characters. When the film opens it is automatically assumed that the audience knows who the characters are, there is really no introduction. As such to viewer who is not familiar with the Star Trek franchise, it can be a little confusion. Personally, having watched Star Trek in the past and being familiar with many of the characters that make an appearance, the problem is not really so great for me, and it is also difficult to see it from an alternate point of view. What was also a little disappointing was that the only character that came back from Deep Space 9 for the movie was Worf, and I noted that the crew of the Defiant were pretty much nameless crew members. It would have been good to have at least seen Dax in the episode, or maybe some of the other characters, but I suspect that bringing characters across from Deep Space 9 may have added some more awkwardness to the movie that is not needed. In a way it sort of come across as part horror movie, as far as Star Trek can go with the horror genre. I suspect that is what they were trying to do with the Borg invasion of the Enterprise. First we have them scooting around the ventilation ducts as if it were an Alien movie, then we have the Borg Queen grafting skin onto Data to give him the sensation of humanity. In some horror films the concept of flesh plays a significant role, however in this film it is simply the representation of Data's desire to become more human. In the end he does sacrifice his new found skin, and sensation, to save the lives of his friends.
