    The trilogy that marked and changed cinema forever, that gave George Lucas an huge success, and in this last chapter Lucas once again ask the help of Lawrence Kasdan on the script and delivery the direction to Richard Marquand. All together concludes with a golden key to the magnificent trilogy.....but unfortunately the movie nearly surpasses its magnificent predecessor. "Return" begins months after the events of the previous film with Han Solo (Harrison Ford) imprisoned in the palace of his great rival Jabba the Hutt. Luke (Mark Hamill) begins a rescue plan sending the droids R2 - D2 (Kenny Baker) and C - 3PO (Anthony Daniels) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) as bait while Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Lando (Billy Dee Williams) come infiltrated, Lando as soldier and Leia as bounty hunter. Soon after the great rescue, the group joins with the rebels and begins to know that the Empire is rebuilding the battleship "Death Star" under the command of Darth Vader (David Prowse) and begin to dominate the galaxy. The rebels now begin a massive plan to destroy the "Death Star" and finally put an end to the war. But Luke, with the instruction of Yoda (Frank Oz) and Obi - Wan (Alec Guinness), knows that Vader is not the monster that appears to be and begins to try to bring him to the good side of the "force". Such a task will be difficult with the cruel Emperor (Ian McDiarmid) controlling the mind of Vader with the dark side of the force strong in his side. The film never gets to be awful or terrible, as I said before, Lucas and his coworkers end the trilogy perfectly but the film suffers from a serious problem. Since the beginning of the film to the last moment with Yoda (unfortunately) the film flowed superbly, well written and directed by keeping the humor and well action packed. BUT, suddenly the plot jumped to the Rebel base nor explains how Han is feeling after his rescue and now we see very quickly the plan of attack against the Empire. And soon after, we see our beloved crew in the immense forest of Endor entering into a tense action sequence, the action is not a bad thing at all but the rush that the script took over there has a huge problem of narrative that in the end really hurt the film, but everything is reward with a thrilling and exciting final act. Even with a certain problem in the script at the 2nd act, "Return of the Jedi" is a worthy conclusion to one of the best trilogies ever made, thanks to Lucas that since the beginning redefined the genre of sci - fi forever giving her unforgettable characters with an incredible evolution; thanks to stunning visuals effects giving stunning and unforgettable scenarios;, thanks to John Williams with his unforgettable and powerful soundtrack. The trilogy that not only gave us absolute entertainment and genuinely tense moments, but also taught us that we can always reach our dreams just fighting, we all despite the problems and sins can redeem us and that if we all get together despite our different races can destroy all the forces of evil. "Return of the Jedi" doesn't surpasses its predecessors, but is a thrilling and epic conclusion to the trilogy that changed cinema forever. 9/10

    Episode VI(as it was retitled) is a very entertaining end to the original trilogy, which picks up the plot threads from the previous entry, which sees Luke rescuing both Han Solo and Princess Leia from the clutches of the vile Jabba The Hut(exciting sequence) then regroup on the moon of Endor, where one last, devastating attack on the empire is planned, even though the evil Emperor knows all about it, and will use Darth Vader's connection to Luke to destroy them once and for all... For the most part, a satisfying end to the story, is a lot of fun, though hurt because (1) the Ewoks are too cuddly and childish, especially when seen as an adult, in conjunction with the other installments, and (2) The story is uninspired to an extent, being a virtual reprise of the end of 'A New Hope'. Still, this wouldn't bother kids, especially myself on first viewing, who just loved it, and watched them all over and over!

    Return Of The Jedi is the worst Star Wars film. Many may be surprised to hear this, but Return Of The Jedi is definitely the Star Wars film I enjoy the least. The film is hurt by the first third of the film, the rescue of Han Solo. It does nothing to proceed the plot, it's overly long, it's filled with ridiculous things (droid torturing) as well as unnecessary action scenes (Rancor fight) and prevents the film from dealing with more relevant stuff. Additionally, all characters except for Luke Skywalker are abandoned. Han Solo has become a caricature who gets nothing to do after he has been freed. Leia, who had potential, was let down by the writers and had to stay on Endor and become as redundant as Han Solo. Her family history has been wasted. The second Death Star is unoriginal and boring. Luke, the Emperor and the fate of Darth Vader are the only redeeming qualities of the film. But that's 30% at best. 5 stars.

    Really the finale of Star Wars was not meant to be in the trilogy of the original at the time. As the new movies would take place sixteen years with a prequel. But still it is very enjoyable after Han Solo is frozen after the Empire Strikes Back. Luke Skywalker now knowing Darth Vader is his estranged father has a lot on his plate. While after Solo is rescued by Leia, Lando, and Luke, they must defeat the now invincible Death Star. But in order to do that, Luke must face his father reluctantly. Plus if he defeats his father, will officially become a Jedi as he is told by a dying Yoda and finds out he has a secret twin sister. Great finale to the trilogy or is it? As the prequel would not happen until sixteen years later. Hate it that Hamil and Fisher never got passed the post Star Wars stardom that Harrison Ford did later on in life. Very funny and action packed of the finale!

    George Lucas and company bring closure to the lives of the original beloved characters in this admittedly long and episodic but compelling 6th chapter. It's an emotional journey, to be sure, more emotional than the first two films, but it offers enough excitement and humour to make it great diversionary entertainment. The actors settle into their old roles comfortably and are very well supported by a rich variety of human and alien characters. With the directing reins now turned over to Richard Marquand (hired for this gig based on his direction of the thriller "Eye of the Needle"), the story is broken into a few major set pieces. Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Lando Calrissian and others reunite to rescue their good friend Han Solo from the decadent palace of loathsome alien slug Jabba the Hutt, the powerful crime kingpin for whom Han had once smuggled goods. The action moves to Dagobah, where Luke confronts Yoda over the matter of his parentage, and on to the woodsy moon of Endor where the Rebels are plotting to destroy the shield that the Empire is using to protect its latest Death Star battle station. And Luke finally has the confrontation with his father Darth Vader and the deadly, seductive Emperor (a deliciously evil Ian McDiarmid) that Ben and Yoda had insisted would be inevitable. While lacking the innovative nature of the first film, and dark, more mature quality of the second, this entry does bring a satisfying conclusion to the saga, in the spirit of those old adventure serials of decades past. John Williams' music is as rousing as it's ever been, and the filmmakers once again plunge us into an assortment of different environments (desert, swamp, forest, etc.) The chase and battle sequences are truly breathtaking and impressive. The early scenes in Jabbas' palace allow the creature and makeup departments to come up with moments that can rival the memorable cantina segment from "Star Wars". That brings this review to the matter of the Ewoks, those fuzzy teddy bears whom a fair amount of the audience profess to hate. All this viewer can say is that he's never had a problem with them. Particularly enjoyable is the resolution to Luke's relationship with Vader, as the black clad villain rediscovers his humanity when forced to make a choice. Of course, I would be remiss if I didn't bring up certain scenes with Leia, which have intrigued scores of boys and men over the years. "Return of the Jedi" may not be as good as its predecessors overall, but it's still quite a bit of fun. Eight out of 10.

    While not as derided as the three prequels, this final film of the original trilogy isn't held in as high a regard as Episodes IV and V. But for the life of me, I can't really think why. Yes, the Ewoks feel like kiddie-friendly merchandising opportunities but are they more annoying than, say, Jar-Jar Binks? If anything, the film largely dispenses with story-telling and focuses on wrapping everything up in a vast, effects-driven climatic action sequence or two. Certainly, there are no earth-shattering revelations that lifted "Empire Strikes Back" or a moment as jaw-dropping as the original attack on the Death Star in "A New Hope" but there are still plenty of moments to savour from the opening scenes to the very last shot. In a galaxy far away, the Rebel Alliance is at a crossroads. With the Empire constructing a new Death Star, a small Rebel fleet is amassing to launch a suicide mission to destroy it but our heroes have more pressing needs - Han Solo (Harrison Ford) is held captive in Jabba the Hutt's palace and after Lando (Billy Dee Williams) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) go missing trying to rescue him, R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) are sent forth to try. But it's Luke (Mark Hamill) who has the most to deal with - coming to terms with the devastating news about Darth Vader (David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones), Luke returns to Dagobah to complete his Jedi training with the dying Yoda (Frank Oz) but soon finds more information about his family, his destiny and the part in the plans of the frail Emperor (Ian McDiarmid)... "Return Of The Jedi" is probably my favourite Star Wars film of all because I am an action fan and can think of few things better than the rescue of Han from Jabba's palace. It has everything - model work, puppets of an extraordinary standard, a believable melting pot of alien life and language, danger, adventure, sex (who knew Carrie Fisher could look THAT good?) and that rousing soundtrack whenever a light-sabre is fired up. In a sense, the movie slows down a bit until the final reel when the Rebels take the fight to the Death Star once again. However, I do have to point out a couple of things I didn't like - the first of which are the Ewoks. Are they really a match for, as the Emperor himself put it, "an entire legion of my best troops" and the sub-plot about C-3PO being mistaken as a god felt tacky and badly written (surprise, surprise). I also felt Williams was underused as Lando and all-too-quickly forgiven for his betrayal in the previous film. Dialogue is also a sticking point but with all Star Wars films, you expect lines like "I have a bad feeling about this". But such trivial points cannot stop me from enjoying this. "Return Of The Jedi" is an old-fashioned adventure movie full of characters we've known and loved for the last couple of movies. It may lack some of the ambition or originality of the earlier movies but it still feels like a complete and full universe, bursting with characters that teem with life and stories that go begging to be told. My favourite moment, possibly of the whole saga, is when the great Rancor's keeper comes out to check his beloved beastie after his meeting with Luke. He sobs and shakes his head with genuine sadness for the enormous ugly brute we were repulsed by mere seconds before. It's a moment that goes largely unnoticed and is probably forgotten by most viewers (especially one Leia appears in that gold bikini get-up) but it shows how much depth, thought and real love there is in these films. I can never tire of watching the original trilogy and this one in particular. It may be the weakest of the three originals but personally, it is my favourite because even as Luke wrestles with Vader and the Emperor's attempts to turn him to the Dark Side, you're with him every inch of the way. It's a glorious end to the saga which, I fear, will only be weakened by the desperate money-hungry attempt to spin off another three films. Stick with Episodes IV - VI and enjoy.

    Amazing to think that this was once considered the weak link of the original ST trilogy . Time has told us that THE PHANTOM MENACE and its two follow ups shows us that that there's a sucker born every minute who will watch any old rubbish if it ties in with STAR WARS . While watching RETURN OF THE JEDI I was struck as to how impressive it was in its own right never mind compared to the prequels spewed up by Lucas but also how superior it was to James Cameron's AVATAR a film that owes a lot to this one Story wise JEDI is no great shakes , being just a retread of the most part of the first film where The Imperial Empire are building a Death Star and the Rebel Alliance trying to stop them . Where the film does succeed is a sense of humour when the first half concentrates on the droids R2D2 and the camp and cowardly C3PO as they find themselves at the mercy of Jabba . Some fans of the series might complain that this loses some of the darkness that EMPIRE contained but as someone who isn't this was welcomed by me since it makes the film more watchable as a neutral audience member The story then jumps to the forest world of Endor which is populated by Ewoks . Lucas is on record as saying a technologically advanced power being beaten by a backward guerrilla force was inspired by Vietnam and you can see the parallels to an extent and while you won't be reminded of APOCALYPSE NOW you are aware that that Cameron had the same idea with AVATAR but at least the scenes on Endor don't suffer from the ponderous effects laden self importance we got with Cameron RETURN OF THE JEDI ends the trilogy that became part of a great number of peoples childhoods . I was never taken too much by the STAR WARS films though I was impressed by the costume design and I can see why so many people fell in love with the original movies . They are entertaining where the story telling and special effects compliment one another rather than the story being written around the effects and set pieces as happens in so many films in the 21st Century so even for nostalgic reasons I can understand he affection the films are held in . Just a pity Lucas had to go and ruin things by later making a trilogy of product placement

    Star Wars: Episode VI- Return of the Jedi is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline,a terrific cast like their always is in Star Wars and fantastic and extremely lovable characters.This movie is definitely not as good as A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back,but I was still very pleased with this finale and it was a great send off for these characters,especially for Darth Vader.I think the main problem is that it got a bit too cute and lost a lot of the darkness from the previous films,mainly with the Ewoks,although they really were adorable.Fans of the original Star Wars trilogy won't like it as much as the previous two,but will still very pleased with this fitting finale. In his final adventure against the Empire,Luke must save Han Solo and the rest of the crew from Jabba the Hutt,destroy the second Death Star and face the fact his father Anakin Skywalker has been taken over by Darth Vader.

    Grade: B Star Wars The Return of the Jedi is a good, solid ending to the series as it has entertaining moments, a good conclusion, and raps it up nice and clean to please the audience, adding a cuddly new character and meeting the Emperor for the first and only time. The film is good, but with everything, I only would give it a B, I feel like that's what it deserves. It starts with Leia, disguised as a bounty hunter, entering Jabba the Hutt's palace, as he holds Han's frozen body as a trophy for not paying him back. She frees him, and Luke appears too, but he puts Luke in a pit, and Leia as his slave, but Luke wins, then he and Han are captured and now are going to be given to an animal living in the sand, but R2-D2, who was there with Leia, has Luke's light saber and shoots it to him and they fight, but the disappointing part is that even with all this protection and whatever you call it, Jabba is killed my Leia just chocking his big fat neck with her chains when he is not looking. They escape and Jango Fett is killed by being fed to the sand creature. Luke then goes to Dagobah and Luke and meets Yoda for the final time as Yoda dies and he sees Ben's spirit again to discuss about Darth Vader. Then they meet as they are coming up with a plan to destroy the new Death Star, and to end the war. Luke will go up into the Death Star to face Vader, Leia and Han will destroy the base on the planet, and the Rebels will fight the Sith in space and detonate the ship/planet. On the planet is fine and also in space, the real enjoyment was in the Death Star as Luke confronts Vader and the Emperor. He then fights Darth Vader and the Emperor and Vader try to bring out the dark side in Luke. They come close as Luke cuts Vader's hand off, but then calms down and refuses to join the Dark Side and the Emperor electrifies him and he starts screaming in agony. Vader stands up and watches his own son being tortured by his master. Then, one the greatest moments in the series, grabs the Emperor and throws him off the balcony to his death, but then he starts dying. Luke takes Vader to an escape ship and takes off Vader's mask since he wants to see his son for the first time. It's rather touching, but disappointing as the whole time you would be expecting James Earl Jones' face under that mask, but it wasn't. Vader dies and takes the body to the planet and flees as the Rebel's blow up the Death Star, ending the war. They celebrate on the planet, and Luke sees the spirits of Yoda, Ben, and his father Anakin (in the old version, he's old, in the new version, he's younger). The Phantom Menace copied this movie with its finale, and both very really interesting all around, there was always that one that stood out, but this one did a better job at keeping our interest while the other made our minds wander in between light saber duel scenes. Well this film was a good film with a great conclusion, fun fight sequences and is a good film to add to the Star Wars original trilogy.

    As far as I'm concerned, I think Randal's right. There's really only one "Return" that I prefer to watch over & over again and that's "Return of the Jedi," directed in 1983 by the late Richard Marquand and is the final film in the original "Star Wars" trilogy. We should all know by now that Kevin Smith is a staunch "Star Wars" loyalist, so I won't fault him there. I honestly have nothing personal against the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy that was so meticulously constructed by Peter Jackson from J.R.R. Tolkien's landmark fantasy novels; it's just that I'm a life-long "Star Wars" geek and Jackson had it comparatively easier in trying to get those movies made, not to mention a deeply entrenched fan-base supporting his efforts. "Star Wars" creator George Lucas had to start from scratch and fight an uphill battle almost every step of the way to get "Star Wars" (1977) and its sequels to the screen, with little help or backing from the studio and most of all, almost no one believed in his story or vision, creativity or ingenuity. And only now, more than a quarter of a century later, do people finally "get" the significance of "Star Wars" and what Lucas achieved in 1977. "Return of the Jedi," for the longest time, was probably my favorite of the original trilogy; astute readers will realize "The Empire Strikes Back" (1980) is my favorite "Star Wars" film all around (2005's "Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith" is the best from the prequel trilogy, in my opinion). At different times, I've considered all the original films a "favorite," but a long while ago I realized the towering achievement and perfection that was "The Empire Strikes Back." Like everyone else, I'll mostly agree that "Return of the Jedi" is by far the weakest of the original trilogy. But that does not mean it's bad or even remotely disappointing. In fact, it's actually very good and very much a thrilling science fiction adventure film from start to finish. I guess the primary reason "Return" suffers in comparison is because it appears to be somewhat of a step down in terms of what was achieved in "Star Wars" and "The Empire Strikes Back." A lot of people seem to criticize the lighter, more family-friendly root that Lucas's story took in this film, most notably with the inclusion of the cute & cuddly Ewoks of forest-moon Endor (which aren't nearly as bad as some people would make them out to be and they do provide some light comic relief during the otherwise intense battle scenes toward the end) and the cleaner resolution for the overall saga. This was a swift change considering the darker story and direction that George Lucas decided to take with "The Empire Strikes Back." The film still flies high on its revolutionary special effects - which, 30 years later, still knock most of the CGI-laden spectacles of 2013 Hollywood out of the water - captivating story, entrenched multi-dimensional characters, and brilliant action sequences. "Return of the Jedi" is still a first-degree special effects spectacle. 10/10

    Really the finale of Star Wars was not meant to be in the trilogy of the original at the time. As the new movies would take place sixteen years with a prequel. But still it is very enjoyable after Han Solo is frozen after the Empire Strikes Back. Luke Skywalker now knowing Darth Vader is his estranged father has a lot on his plate. While after Solo is rescued by Leia, Lando, and Luke, they must defeat the now invincible Death Star. But in order to do that, Luke must face his father reluctantly. Plus if he defeats his father, will officially become a Jedi as he is told by a dying Yoda and finds out he has a secret twin sister. Great finale to the trilogy or is it? As the prequel would not happen until sixteen years later. Hate it that Hamil and Fisher never got passed the post Star Wars stardom that Harrison Ford did later on in life. Very funny and action packed of the finale!

    George Lucas and company bring closure to the lives of the original beloved characters in this admittedly long and episodic but compelling 6th chapter. It's an emotional journey, to be sure, more emotional than the first two films, but it offers enough excitement and humour to make it great diversionary entertainment. The actors settle into their old roles comfortably and are very well supported by a rich variety of human and alien characters. With the directing reins now turned over to Richard Marquand (hired for this gig based on his direction of the thriller "Eye of the Needle"), the story is broken into a few major set pieces. Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Lando Calrissian and others reunite to rescue their good friend Han Solo from the decadent palace of loathsome alien slug Jabba the Hutt, the powerful crime kingpin for whom Han had once smuggled goods. The action moves to Dagobah, where Luke confronts Yoda over the matter of his parentage, and on to the woodsy moon of Endor where the Rebels are plotting to destroy the shield that the Empire is using to protect its latest Death Star battle station. And Luke finally has the confrontation with his father Darth Vader and the deadly, seductive Emperor (a deliciously evil Ian McDiarmid) that Ben and Yoda had insisted would be inevitable. While lacking the innovative nature of the first film, and dark, more mature quality of the second, this entry does bring a satisfying conclusion to the saga, in the spirit of those old adventure serials of decades past. John Williams' music is as rousing as it's ever been, and the filmmakers once again plunge us into an assortment of different environments (desert, swamp, forest, etc.) The chase and battle sequences are truly breathtaking and impressive. The early scenes in Jabbas' palace allow the creature and makeup departments to come up with moments that can rival the memorable cantina segment from "Star Wars". That brings this review to the matter of the Ewoks, those fuzzy teddy bears whom a fair amount of the audience profess to hate. All this viewer can say is that he's never had a problem with them. Particularly enjoyable is the resolution to Luke's relationship with Vader, as the black clad villain rediscovers his humanity when forced to make a choice. Of course, I would be remiss if I didn't bring up certain scenes with Leia, which have intrigued scores of boys and men over the years. "Return of the Jedi" may not be as good as its predecessors overall, but it's still quite a bit of fun. Eight out of 10.

    While not as derided as the three prequels, this final film of the original trilogy isn't held in as high a regard as Episodes IV and V. But for the life of me, I can't really think why. Yes, the Ewoks feel like kiddie-friendly merchandising opportunities but are they more annoying than, say, Jar-Jar Binks? If anything, the film largely dispenses with story-telling and focuses on wrapping everything up in a vast, effects-driven climatic action sequence or two. Certainly, there are no earth-shattering revelations that lifted "Empire Strikes Back" or a moment as jaw-dropping as the original attack on the Death Star in "A New Hope" but there are still plenty of moments to savour from the opening scenes to the very last shot. In a galaxy far away, the Rebel Alliance is at a crossroads. With the Empire constructing a new Death Star, a small Rebel fleet is amassing to launch a suicide mission to destroy it but our heroes have more pressing needs - Han Solo (Harrison Ford) is held captive in Jabba the Hutt's palace and after Lando (Billy Dee Williams) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) go missing trying to rescue him, R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) are sent forth to try. But it's Luke (Mark Hamill) who has the most to deal with - coming to terms with the devastating news about Darth Vader (David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones), Luke returns to Dagobah to complete his Jedi training with the dying Yoda (Frank Oz) but soon finds more information about his family, his destiny and the part in the plans of the frail Emperor (Ian McDiarmid)... "Return Of The Jedi" is probably my favourite Star Wars film of all because I am an action fan and can think of few things better than the rescue of Han from Jabba's palace. It has everything - model work, puppets of an extraordinary standard, a believable melting pot of alien life and language, danger, adventure, sex (who knew Carrie Fisher could look THAT good?) and that rousing soundtrack whenever a light-sabre is fired up. In a sense, the movie slows down a bit until the final reel when the Rebels take the fight to the Death Star once again. However, I do have to point out a couple of things I didn't like - the first of which are the Ewoks. Are they really a match for, as the Emperor himself put it, "an entire legion of my best troops" and the sub-plot about C-3PO being mistaken as a god felt tacky and badly written (surprise, surprise). I also felt Williams was underused as Lando and all-too-quickly forgiven for his betrayal in the previous film. Dialogue is also a sticking point but with all Star Wars films, you expect lines like "I have a bad feeling about this". But such trivial points cannot stop me from enjoying this. "Return Of The Jedi" is an old-fashioned adventure movie full of characters we've known and loved for the last couple of movies. It may lack some of the ambition or originality of the earlier movies but it still feels like a complete and full universe, bursting with characters that teem with life and stories that go begging to be told. My favourite moment, possibly of the whole saga, is when the great Rancor's keeper comes out to check his beloved beastie after his meeting with Luke. He sobs and shakes his head with genuine sadness for the enormous ugly brute we were repulsed by mere seconds before. It's a moment that goes largely unnoticed and is probably forgotten by most viewers (especially one Leia appears in that gold bikini get-up) but it shows how much depth, thought and real love there is in these films. I can never tire of watching the original trilogy and this one in particular. It may be the weakest of the three originals but personally, it is my favourite because even as Luke wrestles with Vader and the Emperor's attempts to turn him to the Dark Side, you're with him every inch of the way. It's a glorious end to the saga which, I fear, will only be weakened by the desperate money-hungry attempt to spin off another three films. Stick with Episodes IV - VI and enjoy.

    Amazing to think that this was once considered the weak link of the original ST trilogy . Time has told us that THE PHANTOM MENACE and its two follow ups shows us that that there's a sucker born every minute who will watch any old rubbish if it ties in with STAR WARS . While watching RETURN OF THE JEDI I was struck as to how impressive it was in its own right never mind compared to the prequels spewed up by Lucas but also how superior it was to James Cameron's AVATAR a film that owes a lot to this one Story wise JEDI is no great shakes , being just a retread of the most part of the first film where The Imperial Empire are building a Death Star and the Rebel Alliance trying to stop them . Where the film does succeed is a sense of humour when the first half concentrates on the droids R2D2 and the camp and cowardly C3PO as they find themselves at the mercy of Jabba . Some fans of the series might complain that this loses some of the darkness that EMPIRE contained but as someone who isn't this was welcomed by me since it makes the film more watchable as a neutral audience member The story then jumps to the forest world of Endor which is populated by Ewoks . Lucas is on record as saying a technologically advanced power being beaten by a backward guerrilla force was inspired by Vietnam and you can see the parallels to an extent and while you won't be reminded of APOCALYPSE NOW you are aware that that Cameron had the same idea with AVATAR but at least the scenes on Endor don't suffer from the ponderous effects laden self importance we got with Cameron RETURN OF THE JEDI ends the trilogy that became part of a great number of peoples childhoods . I was never taken too much by the STAR WARS films though I was impressed by the costume design and I can see why so many people fell in love with the original movies . They are entertaining where the story telling and special effects compliment one another rather than the story being written around the effects and set pieces as happens in so many films in the 21st Century so even for nostalgic reasons I can understand he affection the films are held in . Just a pity Lucas had to go and ruin things by later making a trilogy of product placement

    Star Wars: Episode VI- Return of the Jedi is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline,a terrific cast like their always is in Star Wars and fantastic and extremely lovable characters.This movie is definitely not as good as A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back,but I was still very pleased with this finale and it was a great send off for these characters,especially for Darth Vader.I think the main problem is that it got a bit too cute and lost a lot of the darkness from the previous films,mainly with the Ewoks,although they really were adorable.Fans of the original Star Wars trilogy won't like it as much as the previous two,but will still very pleased with this fitting finale. In his final adventure against the Empire,Luke must save Han Solo and the rest of the crew from Jabba the Hutt,destroy the second Death Star and face the fact his father Anakin Skywalker has been taken over by Darth Vader.

    Grade: B Star Wars The Return of the Jedi is a good, solid ending to the series as it has entertaining moments, a good conclusion, and raps it up nice and clean to please the audience, adding a cuddly new character and meeting the Emperor for the first and only time. The film is good, but with everything, I only would give it a B, I feel like that's what it deserves. It starts with Leia, disguised as a bounty hunter, entering Jabba the Hutt's palace, as he holds Han's frozen body as a trophy for not paying him back. She frees him, and Luke appears too, but he puts Luke in a pit, and Leia as his slave, but Luke wins, then he and Han are captured and now are going to be given to an animal living in the sand, but R2-D2, who was there with Leia, has Luke's light saber and shoots it to him and they fight, but the disappointing part is that even with all this protection and whatever you call it, Jabba is killed my Leia just chocking his big fat neck with her chains when he is not looking. They escape and Jango Fett is killed by being fed to the sand creature. Luke then goes to Dagobah and Luke and meets Yoda for the final time as Yoda dies and he sees Ben's spirit again to discuss about Darth Vader. Then they meet as they are coming up with a plan to destroy the new Death Star, and to end the war. Luke will go up into the Death Star to face Vader, Leia and Han will destroy the base on the planet, and the Rebels will fight the Sith in space and detonate the ship/planet. On the planet is fine and also in space, the real enjoyment was in the Death Star as Luke confronts Vader and the Emperor. He then fights Darth Vader and the Emperor and Vader try to bring out the dark side in Luke. They come close as Luke cuts Vader's hand off, but then calms down and refuses to join the Dark Side and the Emperor electrifies him and he starts screaming in agony. Vader stands up and watches his own son being tortured by his master. Then, one the greatest moments in the series, grabs the Emperor and throws him off the balcony to his death, but then he starts dying. Luke takes Vader to an escape ship and takes off Vader's mask since he wants to see his son for the first time. It's rather touching, but disappointing as the whole time you would be expecting James Earl Jones' face under that mask, but it wasn't. Vader dies and takes the body to the planet and flees as the Rebel's blow up the Death Star, ending the war. They celebrate on the planet, and Luke sees the spirits of Yoda, Ben, and his father Anakin (in the old version, he's old, in the new version, he's younger). The Phantom Menace copied this movie with its finale, and both very really interesting all around, there was always that one that stood out, but this one did a better job at keeping our interest while the other made our minds wander in between light saber duel scenes. Well this film was a good film with a great conclusion, fun fight sequences and is a good film to add to the Star Wars original trilogy.

    "There's only one return, you f*****g morons, and it's not 'of the King,' it's 'of the Jedi!'" - Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson), in "Clerks II" (2006)

    As far as I'm concerned, I think Randal's right. There's really only one "Return" that I prefer to watch over & over again and that's "Return of the Jedi," directed in 1983 by the late Richard Marquand and is the final film in the original "Star Wars" trilogy. We should all know by now that Kevin Smith is a staunch "Star Wars" loyalist, so I won't fault him there. I honestly have nothing personal against the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy that was so meticulously constructed by Peter Jackson from J.R.R. Tolkien's landmark fantasy novels; it's just that I'm a life-long "Star Wars" geek and Jackson had it comparatively easier in trying to get those movies made, not to mention a deeply entrenched fan-base supporting his efforts. "Star Wars" creator George Lucas had to start from scratch and fight an uphill battle almost every step of the way to get "Star Wars" (1977) and its sequels to the screen, with little help or backing from the studio and most of all, almost no one believed in his story or vision, creativity or ingenuity. And only now, more than a quarter of a century later, do people finally "get" the significance of "Star Wars" and what Lucas achieved in 1977. "Return of the Jedi," for the longest time, was probably my favorite of the original trilogy; astute readers will realize "The Empire Strikes Back" (1980) is my favorite "Star Wars" film all around (2005's "Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith" is the best from the prequel trilogy, in my opinion). At different times, I've considered all the original films a "favorite," but a long while ago I realized the towering achievement and perfection that was "The Empire Strikes Back." Like everyone else, I'll mostly agree that "Return of the Jedi" is by far the weakest of the original trilogy. But that does not mean it's bad or even remotely disappointing. In fact, it's actually very good and very much a thrilling science fiction adventure film from start to finish. I guess the primary reason "Return" suffers in comparison is because it appears to be somewhat of a step down in terms of what was achieved in "Star Wars" and "The Empire Strikes Back." A lot of people seem to criticize the lighter, more family-friendly root that Lucas's story took in this film, most notably with the inclusion of the cute & cuddly Ewoks of forest-moon Endor (which aren't nearly as bad as some people would make them out to be and they do provide some light comic relief during the otherwise intense battle scenes toward the end) and the cleaner resolution for the overall saga. This was a swift change considering the darker story and direction that George Lucas decided to take with "The Empire Strikes Back." The film still flies high on its revolutionary special effects - which, 30 years later, still knock most of the CGI-laden spectacles of 2013 Hollywood out of the water - captivating story, entrenched multi-dimensional characters, and brilliant action sequences. "Return of the Jedi" is still a first-degree special effects spectacle. 10/10

    The trilogy that marked and changed cinema forever, that gave George Lucas an huge success, and in this last chapter Lucas once again ask the help of Lawrence Kasdan on the script and delivery the direction to Richard Marquand. All together concludes with a golden key to the magnificent trilogy.....but unfortunately the movie nearly surpasses its magnificent predecessor. "Return" begins months after the events of the previous film with Han Solo (Harrison Ford) imprisoned in the palace of his great rival Jabba the Hutt. Luke (Mark Hamill) begins a rescue plan sending the droids R2 - D2 (Kenny Baker) and C - 3PO (Anthony Daniels) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) as bait while Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Lando (Billy Dee Williams) come infiltrated, Lando as soldier and Leia as bounty hunter. Soon after the great rescue, the group joins with the rebels and begins to know that the Empire is rebuilding the battleship "Death Star" under the command of Darth Vader (David Prowse) and begin to dominate the galaxy. The rebels now begin a massive plan to destroy the "Death Star" and finally put an end to the war. But Luke, with the instruction of Yoda (Frank Oz) and Obi - Wan (Alec Guinness), knows that Vader is not the monster that appears to be and begins to try to bring him to the good side of the "force". Such a task will be difficult with the cruel Emperor (Ian McDiarmid) controlling the mind of Vader with the dark side of the force strong in his side. The film never gets to be awful or terrible, as I said before, Lucas and his coworkers end the trilogy perfectly but the film suffers from a serious problem. Since the beginning of the film to the last moment with Yoda (unfortunately) the film flowed superbly, well written and directed by keeping the humor and well action packed. BUT, suddenly the plot jumped to the Rebel base nor explains how Han is feeling after his rescue and now we see very quickly the plan of attack against the Empire. And soon after, we see our beloved crew in the immense forest of Endor entering into a tense action sequence, the action is not a bad thing at all but the rush that the script took over there has a huge problem of narrative that in the end really hurt the film, but everything is reward with a thrilling and exciting final act. Even with a certain problem in the script at the 2nd act, "Return of the Jedi" is a worthy conclusion to one of the best trilogies ever made, thanks to Lucas that since the beginning redefined the genre of sci - fi forever giving her unforgettable characters with an incredible evolution; thanks to stunning visuals effects giving stunning and unforgettable scenarios;, thanks to John Williams with his unforgettable and powerful soundtrack. The trilogy that not only gave us absolute entertainment and genuinely tense moments, but also taught us that we can always reach our dreams just fighting, we all despite the problems and sins can redeem us and that if we all get together despite our different races can destroy all the forces of evil. "Return of the Jedi" doesn't surpasses its predecessors, but is a thrilling and epic conclusion to the trilogy that changed cinema forever. 9/10

    Episode VI(as it was retitled) is a very entertaining end to the original trilogy, which picks up the plot threads from the previous entry, which sees Luke rescuing both Han Solo and Princess Leia from the clutches of the vile Jabba The Hut(exciting sequence) then regroup on the moon of Endor, where one last, devastating attack on the empire is planned, even though the evil Emperor knows all about it, and will use Darth Vader's connection to Luke to destroy them once and for all... For the most part, a satisfying end to the story, is a lot of fun, though hurt because (1) the Ewoks are too cuddly and childish, especially when seen as an adult, in conjunction with the other installments, and (2) The story is uninspired to an extent, being a virtual reprise of the end of 'A New Hope'. Still, this wouldn't bother kids, especially myself on first viewing, who just loved it, and watched them all over and over!

    Return Of The Jedi is the worst Star Wars film. Many may be surprised to hear this, but Return Of The Jedi is definitely the Star Wars film I enjoy the least. The film is hurt by the first third of the film, the rescue of Han Solo. It does nothing to proceed the plot, it's overly long, it's filled with ridiculous things (droid torturing) as well as unnecessary action scenes (Rancor fight) and prevents the film from dealing with more relevant stuff. Additionally, all characters except for Luke Skywalker are abandoned. Han Solo has become a caricature who gets nothing to do after he has been freed. Leia, who had potential, was let down by the writers and had to stay on Endor and become as redundant as Han Solo. Her family history has been wasted. The second Death Star is unoriginal and boring. Luke, the Emperor and the fate of Darth Vader are the only redeeming qualities of the film. But that's 30% at best. 5 stars.

Time has told us that THE PHANTOM MENACE and its two follow ups shows us that that there's a sucker born every minute who will watch any old rubbish if it ties in with STAR WARS . While watching RETURN OF THE JEDI I was struck as to how impressive it was in its own right never mind compared to the prequels spewed up by Lucas but also how superior it was to James Cameron's AVATAR a film that owes a lot to this one Story wise JEDI is no great shakes , being just a retread of the most part of the first film where The Imperial Empire are building a Death Star and the Rebel Alliance trying to stop them . Where the film does succeed is a sense of humour when the first half concentrates on the droids R2D2 and the camp and cowardly C3PO as they find themselves at the mercy of Jabba . Some fans of the series might complain that this loses some of the darkness that EMPIRE contained but as someone who isn't this was welcomed by me since it makes the film more watchable as a neutral audience member The story then jumps to the forest world of Endor which is populated by Ewoks . Lucas is on record as saying a technologically advanced power being beaten by a backward guerrilla force was inspired by Vietnam and you can see the parallels to an extent and while you won't be reminded of APOCALYPSE NOW you are aware that that Cameron had the same idea with AVATAR but at least the scenes on Endor don't suffer from the ponderous effects laden self importance we got with Cameron RETURN OF THE JEDI ends the trilogy that became part of a great number of peoples childhoods . I was never taken too much by the STAR WARS films though I was impressed by the costume design and I can see why so many people fell in love with the original movies . They are entertaining where the story telling and special effects compliment one another rather than the story being written around the effects and set pieces as happens in so many films in the 21st Century so even for nostalgic reasons I can understand he affection the films are held in . Just a pity Lucas had to go and ruin things by later making a trilogy of product placement

    Star Wars: Episode VI- Return of the Jedi is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline,a terrific cast like their always is in Star Wars and fantastic and extremely lovable characters.This movie is definitely not as good as A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back,but I was still very pleased with this finale and it was a great send off for these characters,especially for Darth Vader.I think the main problem is that it got a bit too cute and lost a lot of the darkness from the previous films,mainly with the Ewoks,although they really were adorable.Fans of the original Star Wars trilogy won't like it as much as the previous two,but will still very pleased with this fitting finale. In his final adventure against the Empire,Luke must save Han Solo and the rest of the crew from Jabba the Hutt,destroy the second Death Star and face the fact his father Anakin Skywalker has been taken over by Darth Vader.

    Grade: B Star Wars The Return of the Jedi is a good, solid ending to the series as it has entertaining moments, a good conclusion, and raps it up nice and clean to please the audience, adding a cuddly new character and meeting the Emperor for the first and only time. The film is good, but with everything, I only would give it a B, I feel like that's what it deserves. It starts with Leia, disguised as a bounty hunter, entering Jabba the Hutt's palace, as he holds Han's frozen body as a trophy for not paying him back. She frees him, and Luke appears too, but he puts Luke in a pit, and Leia as his slave, but Luke wins, then he and Han are captured and now are going to be given to an animal living in the sand, but R2-D2, who was there with Leia, has Luke's light saber and shoots it to him and they fight, but the disappointing part is that even with all this protection and whatever you call it, Jabba is killed my Leia just chocking his big fat neck with her chains when he is not looking. They escape and Jango Fett is killed by being fed to the sand creature. Luke then goes to Dagobah and Luke and meets Yoda for the final time as Yoda dies and he sees Ben's spirit again to discuss about Darth Vader. Then they meet as they are coming up with a plan to destroy the new Death Star, and to end the war. Luke will go up into the Death Star to face Vader, Leia and Han will destroy the base on the planet, and the Rebels will fight the Sith in space and detonate the ship/planet. On the planet is fine and also in space, the real enjoyment was in the Death Star as Luke confronts Vader and the Emperor. He then fights Darth Vader and the Emperor and Vader try to bring out the dark side in Luke. They come close as Luke cuts Vader's hand off, but then calms down and refuses to join the Dark Side and the Emperor electrifies him and he starts screaming in agony. Vader stands up and watches his own son being tortured by his master. Then, one the greatest moments in the series, grabs the Emperor and throws him off the balcony to his death, but then he starts dying. Luke takes Vader to an escape ship and takes off Vader's mask since he wants to see his son for the first time. It's rather touching, but disappointing as the whole time you would be expecting James Earl Jones' face under that mask, but it wasn't. Vader dies and takes the body to the planet and flees as the Rebel's blow up the Death Star, ending the war. They celebrate on the planet, and Luke sees the spirits of Yoda, Ben, and his father Anakin (in the old version, he's old, in the new version, he's younger). The Phantom Menace copied this movie with its finale, and both very really interesting all around, there was always that one that stood out, but this one did a better job at keeping our interest while the other made our minds wander in between light saber duel scenes. Well this film was a good film with a great conclusion, fun fight sequences and is a good film to add to the Star Wars original trilogy.

    As far as I'm concerned, I think Randal's right. There's really only one "Return" that I prefer to watch over & over again and that's "Return of the Jedi," directed in 1983 by the late Richard Marquand and is the final film in the original "Star Wars" trilogy. We should all know by now that Kevin Smith is a staunch "Star Wars" loyalist, so I won't fault him there. I honestly have nothing personal against the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy that was so meticulously constructed by Peter Jackson from J.R.R. Tolkien's landmark fantasy novels; it's just that I'm a life-long "Star Wars" geek and Jackson had it comparatively easier in trying to get those movies made, not to mention a deeply entrenched fan-base supporting his efforts. "Star Wars" creator George Lucas had to start from scratch and fight an uphill battle almost every step of the way to get "Star Wars" (1977) and its sequels to the screen, with little help or backing from the studio and most of all, almost no one believed in his story or vision, creativity or ingenuity. And only now, more than a quarter of a century later, do people finally "get" the significance of "Star Wars" and what Lucas achieved in 1977. "Return of the Jedi," for the longest time, was probably my favorite of the original trilogy; astute readers will realize "The Empire Strikes Back" (1980) is my favorite "Star Wars" film all around (2005's "Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith" is the best from the prequel trilogy, in my opinion). At different times, I've considered all the original films a "favorite," but a long while ago I realized the towering achievement and perfection that was "The Empire Strikes Back." Like everyone else, I'll mostly agree that "Return of the Jedi" is by far the weakest of the original trilogy. But that does not mean it's bad or even remotely disappointing. In fact, it's actually very good and very much a thrilling science fiction adventure film from start to finish. I guess the primary reason "Return" suffers in comparison is because it appears to be somewhat of a step down in terms of what was achieved in "Star Wars" and "The Empire Strikes Back." A lot of people seem to criticize the lighter, more family-friendly root that Lucas's story took in this film, most notably with the inclusion of the cute & cuddly Ewoks of forest-moon Endor (which aren't nearly as bad as some people would make them out to be and they do provide some light comic relief during the otherwise intense battle scenes toward the end) and the cleaner resolution for the overall saga. This was a swift change considering the darker story and direction that George Lucas decided to take with "The Empire Strikes Back." The film still flies high on its revolutionary special effects - which, 30 years later, still knock most of the CGI-laden spectacles of 2013 Hollywood out of the water - captivating story, entrenched multi-dimensional characters, and brilliant action sequences. "Return of the Jedi" is still a first-degree special effects spectacle. 10/10

    The trilogy that marked and changed cinema forever, that gave George Lucas an huge success, and in this last chapter Lucas once again ask the help of Lawrence Kasdan on the script and delivery the direction to Richard Marquand. All together concludes with a golden key to the magnificent trilogy.....but unfortunately the movie nearly surpasses its magnificent predecessor. "Return" begins months after the events of the previous film with Han Solo (Harrison Ford) imprisoned in the palace of his great rival Jabba the Hutt. Luke (Mark Hamill) begins a rescue plan sending the droids R2 - D2 (Kenny Baker) and C - 3PO (Anthony Daniels) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) as bait while Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Lando (Billy Dee Williams) come infiltrated, Lando as soldier and Leia as bounty hunter. Soon after the great rescue, the group joins with the rebels and begins to know that the Empire is rebuilding the battleship "Death Star" under the command of Darth Vader (David Prowse) and begin to dominate the galaxy. The rebels now begin a massive plan to destroy the "Death Star" and finally put an end to the war. But Luke, with the instruction of Yoda (Frank Oz) and Obi - Wan (Alec Guinness), knows that Vader is not the monster that appears to be and begins to try to bring him to the good side of the "force". Such a task will be difficult with the cruel Emperor (Ian McDiarmid) controlling the mind of Vader with the dark side of the force strong in his side. The film never gets to be awful or terrible, as I said before, Lucas and his coworkers end the trilogy perfectly but the film suffers from a serious problem. Since the beginning of the film to the last moment with Yoda (unfortunately) the film flowed superbly, well written and directed by keeping the humor and well action packed. BUT, suddenly the plot jumped to the Rebel base nor explains how Han is feeling after his rescue and now we see very quickly the plan of attack against the Empire. And soon after, we see our beloved crew in the immense forest of Endor entering into a tense action sequence, the action is not a bad thing at all but the rush that the script took over there has a huge problem of narrative that in the end really hurt the film, but everything is reward with a thrilling and exciting final act. Even with a certain problem in the script at the 2nd act, "Return of the Jedi" is a worthy conclusion to one of the best trilogies ever made, thanks to Lucas that since the beginning redefined the genre of sci - fi forever giving her unforgettable characters with an incredible evolution; thanks to stunning visuals effects giving stunning and unforgettable scenarios;, thanks to John Williams with his unforgettable and powerful soundtrack. The trilogy that not only gave us absolute entertainment and genuinely tense moments, but also taught us that we can always reach our dreams just fighting, we all despite the problems and sins can redeem us and that if we all get together despite our different races can destroy all the forces of evil. "Return of the Jedi" doesn't surpasses its predecessors, but is a thrilling and epic conclusion to the trilogy that changed cinema forever. 9/10

    Episode VI(as it was retitled) is a very entertaining end to the original trilogy, which picks up the plot threads from the previous entry, which sees Luke rescuing both Han Solo and Princess Leia from the clutches of the vile Jabba The Hut(exciting sequence) then regroup on the moon of Endor, where one last, devastating attack on the empire is planned, even though the evil Emperor knows all about it, and will use Darth Vader's connection to Luke to destroy them once and for all... For the most part, a satisfying end to the story, is a lot of fun, though hurt because (1) the Ewoks are too cuddly and childish, especially when seen as an adult, in conjunction with the other installments, and (2) The story is uninspired to an extent, being a virtual reprise of the end of 'A New Hope'. Still, this wouldn't bother kids, especially myself on first viewing, who just loved it, and watched them all over and over!

    Return Of The Jedi is the worst Star Wars film. Many may be surprised to hear this, but Return Of The Jedi is definitely the Star Wars film I enjoy the least. The film is hurt by the first third of the film, the rescue of Han Solo. It does nothing to proceed the plot, it's overly long, it's filled with ridiculous things (droid torturing) as well as unnecessary action scenes (Rancor fight) and prevents the film from dealing with more relevant stuff. Additionally, all characters except for Luke Skywalker are abandoned. Han Solo has become a caricature who gets nothing to do after he has been freed. Leia, who had potential, was let down by the writers and had to stay on Endor and become as redundant as Han Solo. Her family history has been wasted. The second Death Star is unoriginal and boring. Luke, the Emperor and the fate of Darth Vader are the only redeeming qualities of the film. But that's 30% at best. 5 stars.

    Really the finale of Star Wars was not meant to be in the trilogy of the original at the time. As the new movies would take place sixteen years with a prequel. But still it is very enjoyable after Han Solo is frozen after the Empire Strikes Back. Luke Skywalker now knowing Darth Vader is his estranged father has a lot on his plate. While after Solo is rescued by Leia, Lando, and Luke, they must defeat the now invincible Death Star. But in order to do that, Luke must face his father reluctantly. Plus if he defeats his father, will officially become a Jedi as he is told by a dying Yoda and finds out he has a secret twin sister. Great finale to the trilogy or is it? As the prequel would not happen until sixteen years later. Hate it that Hamil and Fisher never got passed the post Star Wars stardom that Harrison Ford did later on in life. Very funny and action packed of the finale!

    George Lucas and company bring closure to the lives of the original beloved characters in this admittedly long and episodic but compelling 6th chapter. It's an emotional journey, to be sure, more emotional than the first two films, but it offers enough excitement and humour to make it great diversionary entertainment. The actors settle into their old roles comfortably and are very well supported by a rich variety of human and alien characters. With the directing reins now turned over to Richard Marquand (hired for this gig based on his direction of the thriller "Eye of the Needle"), the story is broken into a few major set pieces. Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Lando Calrissian and others reunite to rescue their good friend Han Solo from the decadent palace of loathsome alien slug Jabba the Hutt, the powerful crime kingpin for whom Han had once smuggled goods. The action moves to Dagobah, where Luke confronts Yoda over the matter of his parentage, and on to the woodsy moon of Endor where the Rebels are plotting to destroy the shield that the Empire is using to protect its latest Death Star battle station. And Luke finally has the confrontation with his father Darth Vader and the deadly, seductive Emperor (a deliciously evil Ian McDiarmid) that Ben and Yoda had insisted would be inevitable. While lacking the innovative nature of the first film, and dark, more mature quality of the second, this entry does bring a satisfying conclusion to the saga, in the spirit of those old adventure serials of decades past. John Williams' music is as rousing as it's ever been, and the filmmakers once again plunge us into an assortment of different environments (desert, swamp, forest, etc.) The chase and battle sequences are truly breathtaking and impressive. The early scenes in Jabbas' palace allow the creature and makeup departments to come up with moments that can rival the memorable cantina segment from "Star Wars". That brings this review to the matter of the Ewoks, those fuzzy teddy bears whom a fair amount of the audience profess to hate. All this viewer can say is that he's never had a problem with them. Particularly enjoyable is the resolution to Luke's relationship with Vader, as the black clad villain rediscovers his humanity when forced to make a choice. Of course, I would be remiss if I didn't bring up certain scenes with Leia, which have intrigued scores of boys and men over the years. "Return of the Jedi" may not be as good as its predecessors overall, but it's still quite a bit of fun. Eight out of 10.

    While not as derided as the three prequels, this final film of the original trilogy isn't held in as high a regard as Episodes IV and V. But for the life of me, I can't really think why. Yes, the Ewoks feel like kiddie-friendly merchandising opportunities but are they more annoying than, say, Jar-Jar Binks? If anything, the film largely dispenses with story-telling and focuses on wrapping everything up in a vast, effects-driven climatic action sequence or two. Certainly, there are no earth-shattering revelations that lifted "Empire Strikes Back" or a moment as jaw-dropping as the original attack on the Death Star in "A New Hope" but there are still plenty of moments to savour from the opening scenes to the very last shot. In a galaxy far away, the Rebel Alliance is at a crossroads. With the Empire constructing a new Death Star, a small Rebel fleet is amassing to launch a suicide mission to destroy it but our heroes have more pressing needs - Han Solo (Harrison Ford) is held captive in Jabba the Hutt's palace and after Lando (Billy Dee Williams) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) go missing trying to rescue him, R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) are sent forth to try. But it's Luke (Mark Hamill) who has the most to deal with - coming to terms with the devastating news about Darth Vader (David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones), Luke returns to Dagobah to complete his Jedi training with the dying Yoda (Frank Oz) but soon finds more information about his family, his destiny and the part in the plans of the frail Emperor (Ian McDiarmid)... "Return Of The Jedi" is probably my favourite Star Wars film of all because I am an action fan and can think of few things better than the rescue of Han from Jabba's palace. It has everything - model work, puppets of an extraordinary standard, a believable melting pot of alien life and language, danger, adventure, sex (who knew Carrie Fisher could look THAT good?) and that rousing soundtrack whenever a light-sabre is fired up. In a sense, the movie slows down a bit until the final reel when the Rebels take the fight to the Death Star once again. However, I do have to point out a couple of things I didn't like - the first of which are the Ewoks. Are they really a match for, as the Emperor himself put it, "an entire legion of my best troops" and the sub-plot about C-3PO being mistaken as a god felt tacky and badly written (surprise, surprise). I also felt Williams was underused as Lando and all-too-quickly forgiven for his betrayal in the previous film. Dialogue is also a sticking point but with all Star Wars films, you expect lines like "I have a bad feeling about this". But such trivial points cannot stop me from enjoying this. "Return Of The Jedi" is an old-fashioned adventure movie full of characters we've known and loved for the last couple of movies. It may lack some of the ambition or originality of the earlier movies but it still feels like a complete and full universe, bursting with characters that teem with life and stories that go begging to be told. My favourite moment, possibly of the whole saga, is when the great Rancor's keeper comes out to check his beloved beastie after his meeting with Luke. He sobs and shakes his head with genuine sadness for the enormous ugly brute we were repulsed by mere seconds before. It's a moment that goes largely unnoticed and is probably forgotten by most viewers (especially one Leia appears in that gold bikini get-up) but it shows how much depth, thought and real love there is in these films. I can never tire of watching the original trilogy and this one in particular. It may be the weakest of the three originals but personally, it is my favourite because even as Luke wrestles with Vader and the Emperor's attempts to turn him to the Dark Side, you're with him every inch of the way. It's a glorious end to the saga which, I fear, will only be weakened by the desperate money-hungry attempt to spin off another three films. Stick with Episodes IV - VI and enjoy.

"Return of the Jedi," for the longest time, was probably my favorite of the original trilogy; astute readers will realize "The Empire Strikes Back" (1980) is my favorite "Star Wars" film all around (2005's "Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith" is the best from the prequel trilogy, in my opinion). At different times, I've considered all the original films a "favorite," but a long while ago I realized the towering achievement and perfection that was "The Empire Strikes Back." Like everyone else, I'll mostly agree that "Return of the Jedi" is by far the weakest of the original trilogy. But that does not mean it's bad or even remotely disappointing. In fact, it's actually very good and very much a thrilling science fiction adventure film from start to finish. I guess the primary reason "Return" suffers in comparison is because it appears to be somewhat of a step down in terms of what was achieved in "Star Wars" and "The Empire Strikes Back." A lot of people seem to criticize the lighter, more family-friendly root that Lucas's story took in this film, most notably with the inclusion of the cute & cuddly Ewoks of forest-moon Endor (which aren't nearly as bad as some people would make them out to be and they do provide some light comic relief during the otherwise intense battle scenes toward the end) and the cleaner resolution for the overall saga. This was a swift change considering the darker story and direction that George Lucas decided to take with "The Empire Strikes Back." The film still flies high on its revolutionary special effects - which, 30 years later, still knock most of the CGI-laden spectacles of 2013 Hollywood out of the water - captivating story, entrenched multi-dimensional characters, and brilliant action sequences. "Return of the Jedi" is still a first-degree special effects spectacle. 10/10

    The trilogy that marked and changed cinema forever, that gave George Lucas an huge success, and in this last chapter Lucas once again ask the help of Lawrence Kasdan on the script and delivery the direction to Richard Marquand. All together concludes with a golden key to the magnificent trilogy.....but unfortunately the movie nearly surpasses its magnificent predecessor. "Return" begins months after the events of the previous film with Han Solo (Harrison Ford) imprisoned in the palace of his great rival Jabba the Hutt. Luke (Mark Hamill) begins a rescue plan sending the droids R2 - D2 (Kenny Baker) and C - 3PO (Anthony Daniels) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) as bait while Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Lando (Billy Dee Williams) come infiltrated, Lando as soldier and Leia as bounty hunter. Soon after the great rescue, the group joins with the rebels and begins to know that the Empire is rebuilding the battleship "Death Star" under the command of Darth Vader (David Prowse) and begin to dominate the galaxy. The rebels now begin a massive plan to destroy the "Death Star" and finally put an end to the war. But Luke, with the instruction of Yoda (Frank Oz) and Obi - Wan (Alec Guinness), knows that Vader is not the monster that appears to be and begins to try to bring him to the good side of the "force". Such a task will be difficult with the cruel Emperor (Ian McDiarmid) controlling the mind of Vader with the dark side of the force strong in his side. The film never gets to be awful or terrible, as I said before, Lucas and his coworkers end the trilogy perfectly but the film suffers from a serious problem. Since the beginning of the film to the last moment with Yoda (unfortunately) the film flowed superbly, well written and directed by keeping the humor and well action packed. BUT, suddenly the plot jumped to the Rebel base nor explains how Han is feeling after his rescue and now we see very quickly the plan of attack against the Empire. And soon after, we see our beloved crew in the immense forest of Endor entering into a tense action sequence, the action is not a bad thing at all but the rush that the script took over there has a huge problem of narrative that in the end really hurt the film, but everything is reward with a thrilling and exciting final act. Even with a certain problem in the script at the 2nd act, "Return of the Jedi" is a worthy conclusion to one of the best trilogies ever made, thanks to Lucas that since the beginning redefined the genre of sci - fi forever giving her unforgettable characters with an incredible evolution; thanks to stunning visuals effects giving stunning and unforgettable scenarios;, thanks to John Williams with his unforgettable and powerful soundtrack. The trilogy that not only gave us absolute entertainment and genuinely tense moments, but also taught us that we can always reach our dreams just fighting, we all despite the problems and sins can redeem us and that if we all get together despite our different races can destroy all the forces of evil. "Return of the Jedi" doesn't surpasses its predecessors, but is a thrilling and epic conclusion to the trilogy that changed cinema forever. 9/10

    Episode VI(as it was retitled) is a very entertaining end to the original trilogy, which picks up the plot threads from the previous entry, which sees Luke rescuing both Han Solo and Princess Leia from the clutches of the vile Jabba The Hut(exciting sequence) then regroup on the moon of Endor, where one last, devastating attack on the empire is planned, even though the evil Emperor knows all about it, and will use Darth Vader's connection to Luke to destroy them once and for all... For the most part, a satisfying end to the story, is a lot of fun, though hurt because (1) the Ewoks are too cuddly and childish, especially when seen as an adult, in conjunction with the other installments, and (2) The story is uninspired to an extent, being a virtual reprise of the end of 'A New Hope'. Still, this wouldn't bother kids, especially myself on first viewing, who just loved it, and watched them all over and over!

    Return Of The Jedi is the worst Star Wars film. Many may be surprised to hear this, but Return Of The Jedi is definitely the Star Wars film I enjoy the least. The film is hurt by the first third of the film, the rescue of Han Solo. It does nothing to proceed the plot, it's overly long, it's filled with ridiculous things (droid torturing) as well as unnecessary action scenes (Rancor fight) and prevents the film from dealing with more relevant stuff. Additionally, all characters except for Luke Skywalker are abandoned. Han Solo has become a caricature who gets nothing to do after he has been freed. Leia, who had potential, was let down by the writers and had to stay on Endor and become as redundant as Han Solo. Her family history has been wasted. The second Death Star is unoriginal and boring. Luke, the Emperor and the fate of Darth Vader are the only redeeming qualities of the film. But that's 30% at best. 5 stars.

    Really the finale of Star Wars was not meant to be in the trilogy of the original at the time. As the new movies would take place sixteen years with a prequel. But still it is very enjoyable after Han Solo is frozen after the Empire Strikes Back. Luke Skywalker now knowing Darth Vader is his estranged father has a lot on his plate. While after Solo is rescued by Leia, Lando, and Luke, they must defeat the now invincible Death Star. But in order to do that, Luke must face his father reluctantly. Plus if he defeats his father, will officially become a Jedi as he is told by a dying Yoda and finds out he has a secret twin sister. Great finale to the trilogy or is it? As the prequel would not happen until sixteen years later. Hate it that Hamil and Fisher never got passed the post Star Wars stardom that Harrison Ford did later on in life. Very funny and action packed of the finale!

    George Lucas and company bring closure to the lives of the original beloved characters in this admittedly long and episodic but compelling 6th chapter. It's an emotional journey, to be sure, more emotional than the first two films, but it offers enough excitement and humour to make it great diversionary entertainment. The actors settle into their old roles comfortably and are very well supported by a rich variety of human and alien characters. With the directing reins now turned over to Richard Marquand (hired for this gig based on his direction of the thriller "Eye of the Needle"), the story is broken into a few major set pieces. Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Lando Calrissian and others reunite to rescue their good friend Han Solo from the decadent palace of loathsome alien slug Jabba the Hutt, the powerful crime kingpin for whom Han had once smuggled goods. The action moves to Dagobah, where Luke confronts Yoda over the matter of his parentage, and on to the woodsy moon of Endor where the Rebels are plotting to destroy the shield that the Empire is using to protect its latest Death Star battle station. And Luke finally has the confrontation with his father Darth Vader and the deadly, seductive Emperor (a deliciously evil Ian McDiarmid) that Ben and Yoda had insisted would be inevitable. While lacking the innovative nature of the first film, and dark, more mature quality of the second, this entry does bring a satisfying conclusion to the saga, in the spirit of those old adventure serials of decades past. John Williams' music is as rousing as it's ever been, and the filmmakers once again plunge us into an assortment of different environments (desert, swamp, forest, etc.) The chase and battle sequences are truly breathtaking and impressive. The early scenes in Jabbas' palace allow the creature and makeup departments to come up with moments that can rival the memorable cantina segment from "Star Wars". That brings this review to the matter of the Ewoks, those fuzzy teddy bears whom a fair amount of the audience profess to hate. All this viewer can say is that he's never had a problem with them. Particularly enjoyable is the resolution to Luke's relationship with Vader, as the black clad villain rediscovers his humanity when forced to make a choice. Of course, I would be remiss if I didn't bring up certain scenes with Leia, which have intrigued scores of boys and men over the years. "Return of the Jedi" may not be as good as its predecessors overall, but it's still quite a bit of fun. Eight out of 10.

    While not as derided as the three prequels, this final film of the original trilogy isn't held in as high a regard as Episodes IV and V. But for the life of me, I can't really think why. Yes, the Ewoks feel like kiddie-friendly merchandising opportunities but are they more annoying than, say, Jar-Jar Binks? If anything, the film largely dispenses with story-telling and focuses on wrapping everything up in a vast, effects-driven climatic action sequence or two. Certainly, there are no earth-shattering revelations that lifted "Empire Strikes Back" or a moment as jaw-dropping as the original attack on the Death Star in "A New Hope" but there are still plenty of moments to savour from the opening scenes to the very last shot. In a galaxy far away, the Rebel Alliance is at a crossroads. With the Empire constructing a new Death Star, a small Rebel fleet is amassing to launch a suicide mission to destroy it but our heroes have more pressing needs - Han Solo (Harrison Ford) is held captive in Jabba the Hutt's palace and after Lando (Billy Dee Williams) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) go missing trying to rescue him, R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) are sent forth to try. But it's Luke (Mark Hamill) who has the most to deal with - coming to terms with the devastating news about Darth Vader (David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones), Luke returns to Dagobah to complete his Jedi training with the dying Yoda (Frank Oz) but soon finds more information about his family, his destiny and the part in the plans of the frail Emperor (Ian McDiarmid)... "Return Of The Jedi" is probably my favourite Star Wars film of all because I am an action fan and can think of few things better than the rescue of Han from Jabba's palace. It has everything - model work, puppets of an extraordinary standard, a believable melting pot of alien life and language, danger, adventure, sex (who knew Carrie Fisher could look THAT good?) and that rousing soundtrack whenever a light-sabre is fired up. In a sense, the movie slows down a bit until the final reel when the Rebels take the fight to the Death Star once again. However, I do have to point out a couple of things I didn't like - the first of which are the Ewoks. Are they really a match for, as the Emperor himself put it, "an entire legion of my best troops" and the sub-plot about C-3PO being mistaken as a god felt tacky and badly written (surprise, surprise). I also felt Williams was underused as Lando and all-too-quickly forgiven for his betrayal in the previous film. Dialogue is also a sticking point but with all Star Wars films, you expect lines like "I have a bad feeling about this". But such trivial points cannot stop me from enjoying this. "Return Of The Jedi" is an old-fashioned adventure movie full of characters we've known and loved for the last couple of movies. It may lack some of the ambition or originality of the earlier movies but it still feels like a complete and full universe, bursting with characters that teem with life and stories that go begging to be told. My favourite moment, possibly of the whole saga, is when the great Rancor's keeper comes out to check his beloved beastie after his meeting with Luke. He sobs and shakes his head with genuine sadness for the enormous ugly brute we were repulsed by mere seconds before. It's a moment that goes largely unnoticed and is probably forgotten by most viewers (especially one Leia appears in that gold bikini get-up) but it shows how much depth, thought and real love there is in these films. I can never tire of watching the original trilogy and this one in particular. It may be the weakest of the three originals but personally, it is my favourite because even as Luke wrestles with Vader and the Emperor's attempts to turn him to the Dark Side, you're with him every inch of the way. It's a glorious end to the saga which, I fear, will only be weakened by the desperate money-hungry attempt to spin off another three films. Stick with Episodes IV - VI and enjoy.

    Amazing to think that this was once considered the weak link of the original ST trilogy . Time has told us that THE PHANTOM MENACE and its two follow ups shows us that that there's a sucker born every minute who will watch any old rubbish if it ties in with STAR WARS . While watching RETURN OF THE JEDI I was struck as to how impressive it was in its own right never mind compared to the prequels spewed up by Lucas but also how superior it was to James Cameron's AVATAR a film that owes a lot to this one Story wise JEDI is no great shakes , being just a retread of the most part of the first film where The Imperial Empire are building a Death Star and the Rebel Alliance trying to stop them . Where the film does succeed is a sense of humour when the first half concentrates on the droids R2D2 and the camp and cowardly C3PO as they find themselves at the mercy of Jabba . Some fans of the series might complain that this loses some of the darkness that EMPIRE contained but as someone who isn't this was welcomed by me since it makes the film more watchable as a neutral audience member The story then jumps to the forest world of Endor which is populated by Ewoks . Lucas is on record as saying a technologically advanced power being beaten by a backward guerrilla force was inspired by Vietnam and you can see the parallels to an extent and while you won't be reminded of APOCALYPSE NOW you are aware that that Cameron had the same idea with AVATAR but at least the scenes on Endor don't suffer from the ponderous effects laden self importance we got with Cameron RETURN OF THE JEDI ends the trilogy that became part of a great number of peoples childhoods . I was never taken too much by the STAR WARS films though I was impressed by the costume design and I can see why so many people fell in love with the original movies . They are entertaining where the story telling and special effects compliment one another rather than the story being written around the effects and set pieces as happens in so many films in the 21st Century so even for nostalgic reasons I can understand he affection the films are held in . Just a pity Lucas had to go and ruin things by later making a trilogy of product placement

    Star Wars: Episode VI- Return of the Jedi is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline,a terrific cast like their always is in Star Wars and fantastic and extremely lovable characters.This movie is definitely not as good as A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back,but I was still very pleased with this finale and it was a great send off for these characters,especially for Darth Vader.I think the main problem is that it got a bit too cute and lost a lot of the darkness from the previous films,mainly with the Ewoks,although they really were adorable.Fans of the original Star Wars trilogy won't like it as much as the previous two,but will still very pleased with this fitting finale. In his final adventure against the Empire,Luke must save Han Solo and the rest of the crew from Jabba the Hutt,destroy the second Death Star and face the fact his father Anakin Skywalker has been taken over by Darth Vader.

    Grade: B Star Wars The Return of the Jedi is a good, solid ending to the series as it has entertaining moments, a good conclusion, and raps it up nice and clean to please the audience, adding a cuddly new character and meeting the Emperor for the first and only time. The film is good, but with everything, I only would give it a B, I feel like that's what it deserves. It starts with Leia, disguised as a bounty hunter, entering Jabba the Hutt's palace, as he holds Han's frozen body as a trophy for not paying him back. She frees him, and Luke appears too, but he puts Luke in a pit, and Leia as his slave, but Luke wins, then he and Han are captured and now are going to be given to an animal living in the sand, but R2-D2, who was there with Leia, has Luke's light saber and shoots it to him and they fight, but the disappointing part is that even with all this protection and whatever you call it, Jabba is killed my Leia just chocking his big fat neck with her chains when he is not looking. They escape and Jango Fett is killed by being fed to the sand creature. Luke then goes to Dagobah and Luke and meets Yoda for the final time as Yoda dies and he sees Ben's spirit again to discuss about Darth Vader. Then they meet as they are coming up with a plan to destroy the new Death Star, and to end the war. Luke will go up into the Death Star to face Vader, Leia and Han will destroy the base on the planet, and the Rebels will fight the Sith in space and detonate the ship/planet. On the planet is fine and also in space, the real enjoyment was in the Death Star as Luke confronts Vader and the Emperor. He then fights Darth Vader and the Emperor and Vader try to bring out the dark side in Luke. They come close as Luke cuts Vader's hand off, but then calms down and refuses to join the Dark Side and the Emperor electrifies him and he starts screaming in agony. Vader stands up and watches his own son being tortured by his master. Then, one the greatest moments in the series, grabs the Emperor and throws him off the balcony to his death, but then he starts dying. Luke takes Vader to an escape ship and takes off Vader's mask since he wants to see his son for the first time. It's rather touching, but disappointing as the whole time you would be expecting James Earl Jones' face under that mask, but it wasn't. Vader dies and takes the body to the planet and flees as the Rebel's blow up the Death Star, ending the war. They celebrate on the planet, and Luke sees the spirits of Yoda, Ben, and his father Anakin (in the old version, he's old, in the new version, he's younger). The Phantom Menace copied this movie with its finale, and both very really interesting all around, there was always that one that stood out, but this one did a better job at keeping our interest while the other made our minds wander in between light saber duel scenes. Well this film was a good film with a great conclusion, fun fight sequences and is a good film to add to the Star Wars original trilogy.

    As far as I'm concerned, I think Randal's right. There's really only one "Return" that I prefer to watch over & over again and that's "Return of the Jedi," directed in 1983 by the late Richard Marquand and is the final film in the original "Star Wars" trilogy. We should all know by now that Kevin Smith is a staunch "Star Wars" loyalist, so I won't fault him there. I honestly have nothing personal against the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy that was so meticulously constructed by Peter Jackson from J.R.R. Tolkien's landmark fantasy novels; it's just that I'm a life-long "Star Wars" geek and Jackson had it comparatively easier in trying to get those movies made, not to mention a deeply entrenched fan-base supporting his efforts. "Star Wars" creator George Lucas had to start from scratch and fight an uphill battle almost every step of the way to get "Star Wars" (1977) and its sequels to the screen, with little help or backing from the studio and most of all, almost no one believed in his story or vision, creativity or ingenuity. And only now, more than a quarter of a century later, do people finally "get" the significance of "Star Wars" and what Lucas achieved in 1977. "Return of the Jedi," for the longest time, was probably my favorite of the original trilogy; astute readers will realize "The Empire Strikes Back" (1980) is my favorite "Star Wars" film all around (2005's "Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith" is the best from the prequel trilogy, in my opinion).

Like everyone else, I'll mostly agree that "Return of the Jedi" is by far the weakest of the original trilogy. But that does not mean it's bad or even remotely disappointing. In fact, it's actually very good and very much a thrilling science fiction adventure film from start to finish. I guess the primary reason "Return" suffers in comparison is because it appears to be somewhat of a step down in terms of what was achieved in "Star Wars" and "The Empire Strikes Back." A lot of people seem to criticize the lighter, more family-friendly root that Lucas's story took in this film, most notably with the inclusion of the cute & cuddly Ewoks of forest-moon Endor (which aren't nearly as bad as some people would make them out to be and they do provide some light comic relief during the otherwise intense battle scenes toward the end) and the cleaner resolution for the overall saga.

    Really the finale of Star Wars was not meant to be in the trilogy of the original at the time. As the new movies would take place sixteen years with a prequel. But still it is very enjoyable after Han Solo is frozen after the Empire Strikes Back. Luke Skywalker now knowing Darth Vader is his estranged father has a lot on his plate. While after Solo is rescued by Leia, Lando, and Luke, they must defeat the now invincible Death Star. But in order to do that, Luke must face his father reluctantly. Plus if he defeats his father, will officially become a Jedi as he is told by a dying Yoda and finds out he has a secret twin sister. Great finale to the trilogy or is it? As the prequel would not happen until sixteen years later. Hate it that Hamil and Fisher never got passed the post Star Wars stardom that Harrison Ford did later on in life. Very funny and action packed of the finale!

    George Lucas and company bring closure to the lives of the original beloved characters in this admittedly long and episodic but compelling 6th chapter. It's an emotional journey, to be sure, more emotional than the first two films, but it offers enough excitement and humour to make it great diversionary entertainment. The actors settle into their old roles comfortably and are very well supported by a rich variety of human and alien characters. With the directing reins now turned over to Richard Marquand (hired for this gig based on his direction of the thriller "Eye of the Needle"), the story is broken into a few major set pieces. Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Lando Calrissian and others reunite to rescue their good friend Han Solo from the decadent palace of loathsome alien slug Jabba the Hutt, the powerful crime kingpin for whom Han had once smuggled goods. The action moves to Dagobah, where Luke confronts Yoda over the matter of his parentage, and on to the woodsy moon of Endor where the Rebels are plotting to destroy the shield that the Empire is using to protect its latest Death Star battle station. And Luke finally has the confrontation with his father Darth Vader and the deadly, seductive Emperor (a deliciously evil Ian McDiarmid) that Ben and Yoda had insisted would be inevitable. While lacking the innovative nature of the first film, and dark, more mature quality of the second, this entry does bring a satisfying conclusion to the saga, in the spirit of those old adventure serials of decades past. John Williams' music is as rousing as it's ever been, and the filmmakers once again plunge us into an assortment of different environments (desert, swamp, forest, etc.) The chase and battle sequences are truly breathtaking and impressive. The early scenes in Jabbas' palace allow the creature and makeup departments to come up with moments that can rival the memorable cantina segment from "Star Wars". That brings this review to the matter of the Ewoks, those fuzzy teddy bears whom a fair amount of the audience profess to hate. All this viewer can say is that he's never had a problem with them. Particularly enjoyable is the resolution to Luke's relationship with Vader, as the black clad villain rediscovers his humanity when forced to make a choice. Of course, I would be remiss if I didn't bring up certain scenes with Leia, which have intrigued scores of boys and men over the years. "Return of the Jedi" may not be as good as its predecessors overall, but it's still quite a bit of fun. Eight out of 10.

    While not as derided as the three prequels, this final film of the original trilogy isn't held in as high a regard as Episodes IV and V. But for the life of me, I can't really think why. Yes, the Ewoks feel like kiddie-friendly merchandising opportunities but are they more annoying than, say, Jar-Jar Binks? If anything, the film largely dispenses with story-telling and focuses on wrapping everything up in a vast, effects-driven climatic action sequence or two. Certainly, there are no earth-shattering revelations that lifted "Empire Strikes Back" or a moment as jaw-dropping as the original attack on the Death Star in "A New Hope" but there are still plenty of moments to savour from the opening scenes to the very last shot. In a galaxy far away, the Rebel Alliance is at a crossroads. With the Empire constructing a new Death Star, a small Rebel fleet is amassing to launch a suicide mission to destroy it but our heroes have more pressing needs - Han Solo (Harrison Ford) is held captive in Jabba the Hutt's palace and after Lando (Billy Dee Williams) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) go missing trying to rescue him, R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) are sent forth to try. But it's Luke (Mark Hamill) who has the most to deal with - coming to terms with the devastating news about Darth Vader (David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones), Luke returns to Dagobah to complete his Jedi training with the dying Yoda (Frank Oz) but soon finds more information about his family, his destiny and the part in the plans of the frail Emperor (Ian McDiarmid)... "Return Of The Jedi" is probably my favourite Star Wars film of all because I am an action fan and can think of few things better than the rescue of Han from Jabba's palace. It has everything - model work, puppets of an extraordinary standard, a believable melting pot of alien life and language, danger, adventure, sex (who knew Carrie Fisher could look THAT good?) and that rousing soundtrack whenever a light-sabre is fired up. In a sense, the movie slows down a bit until the final reel when the Rebels take the fight to the Death Star once again. However, I do have to point out a couple of things I didn't like - the first of which are the Ewoks. Are they really a match for, as the Emperor himself put it, "an entire legion of my best troops" and the sub-plot about C-3PO being mistaken as a god felt tacky and badly written (surprise, surprise). I also felt Williams was underused as Lando and all-too-quickly forgiven for his betrayal in the previous film. Dialogue is also a sticking point but with all Star Wars films, you expect lines like "I have a bad feeling about this". But such trivial points cannot stop me from enjoying this. "Return Of The Jedi" is an old-fashioned adventure movie full of characters we've known and loved for the last couple of movies. It may lack some of the ambition or originality of the earlier movies but it still feels like a complete and full universe, bursting with characters that teem with life and stories that go begging to be told. My favourite moment, possibly of the whole saga, is when the great Rancor's keeper comes out to check his beloved beastie after his meeting with Luke. He sobs and shakes his head with genuine sadness for the enormous ugly brute we were repulsed by mere seconds before. It's a moment that goes largely unnoticed and is probably forgotten by most viewers (especially one Leia appears in that gold bikini get-up) but it shows how much depth, thought and real love there is in these films. I can never tire of watching the original trilogy and this one in particular. It may be the weakest of the three originals but personally, it is my favourite because even as Luke wrestles with Vader and the Emperor's attempts to turn him to the Dark Side, you're with him every inch of the way. It's a glorious end to the saga which, I fear, will only be weakened by the desperate money-hungry attempt to spin off another three films. Stick with Episodes IV - VI and enjoy.

    Amazing to think that this was once considered the weak link of the original ST trilogy . Time has told us that THE PHANTOM MENACE and its two follow ups shows us that that there's a sucker born every minute who will watch any old rubbish if it ties in with STAR WARS . While watching RETURN OF THE JEDI I was struck as to how impressive it was in its own right never mind compared to the prequels spewed up by Lucas but also how superior it was to James Cameron's AVATAR a film that owes a lot to this one Story wise JEDI is no great shakes , being just a retread of the most part of the first film where The Imperial Empire are building a Death Star and the Rebel Alliance trying to stop them . Where the film does succeed is a sense of humour when the first half concentrates on the droids R2D2 and the camp and cowardly C3PO as they find themselves at the mercy of Jabba . Some fans of the series might complain that this loses some of the darkness that EMPIRE contained but as someone who isn't this was welcomed by me since it makes the film more watchable as a neutral audience member The story then jumps to the forest world of Endor which is populated by Ewoks . Lucas is on record as saying a technologically advanced power being beaten by a backward guerrilla force was inspired by Vietnam and you can see the parallels to an extent and while you won't be reminded of APOCALYPSE NOW you are aware that that Cameron had the same idea with AVATAR but at least the scenes on Endor don't suffer from the ponderous effects laden self importance we got with Cameron RETURN OF THE JEDI ends the trilogy that became part of a great number of peoples childhoods . I was never taken too much by the STAR WARS films though I was impressed by the costume design and I can see why so many people fell in love with the original movies . They are entertaining where the story telling and special effects compliment one another rather than the story being written around the effects and set pieces as happens in so many films in the 21st Century so even for nostalgic reasons I can understand he affection the films are held in . Just a pity Lucas had to go and ruin things by later making a trilogy of product placement

    Star Wars: Episode VI- Return of the Jedi is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline,a terrific cast like their always is in Star Wars and fantastic and extremely lovable characters.This movie is definitely not as good as A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back,but I was still very pleased with this finale and it was a great send off for these characters,especially for Darth Vader.I think the main problem is that it got a bit too cute and lost a lot of the darkness from the previous films,mainly with the Ewoks,although they really were adorable.Fans of the original Star Wars trilogy won't like it as much as the previous two,but will still very pleased with this fitting finale. In his final adventure against the Empire,Luke must save Han Solo and the rest of the crew from Jabba the Hutt,destroy the second Death Star and face the fact his father Anakin Skywalker has been taken over by Darth Vader.

    Grade: B Star Wars The Return of the Jedi is a good, solid ending to the series as it has entertaining moments, a good conclusion, and raps it up nice and clean to please the audience, adding a cuddly new character and meeting the Emperor for the first and only time. The film is good, but with everything, I only would give it a B, I feel like that's what it deserves. It starts with Leia, disguised as a bounty hunter, entering Jabba the Hutt's palace, as he holds Han's frozen body as a trophy for not paying him back. She frees him, and Luke appears too, but he puts Luke in a pit, and Leia as his slave, but Luke wins, then he and Han are captured and now are going to be given to an animal living in the sand, but R2-D2, who was there with Leia, has Luke's light saber and shoots it to him and they fight, but the disappointing part is that even with all this protection and whatever you call it, Jabba is killed my Leia just chocking his big fat neck with her chains when he is not looking. They escape and Jango Fett is killed by being fed to the sand creature. Luke then goes to Dagobah and Luke and meets Yoda for the final time as Yoda dies and he sees Ben's spirit again to discuss about Darth Vader. Then they meet as they are coming up with a plan to destroy the new Death Star, and to end the war. Luke will go up into the Death Star to face Vader, Leia and Han will destroy the base on the planet, and the Rebels will fight the Sith in space and detonate the ship/planet. On the planet is fine and also in space, the real enjoyment was in the Death Star as Luke confronts Vader and the Emperor. He then fights Darth Vader and the Emperor and Vader try to bring out the dark side in Luke. They come close as Luke cuts Vader's hand off, but then calms down and refuses to join the Dark Side and the Emperor electrifies him and he starts screaming in agony. Vader stands up and watches his own son being tortured by his master. Then, one the greatest moments in the series, grabs the Emperor and throws him off the balcony to his death, but then he starts dying. Luke takes Vader to an escape ship and takes off Vader's mask since he wants to see his son for the first time. It's rather touching, but disappointing as the whole time you would be expecting James Earl Jones' face under that mask, but it wasn't. Vader dies and takes the body to the planet and flees as the Rebel's blow up the Death Star, ending the war. They celebrate on the planet, and Luke sees the spirits of Yoda, Ben, and his father Anakin (in the old version, he's old, in the new version, he's younger). The Phantom Menace copied this movie with its finale, and both very really interesting all around, there was always that one that stood out, but this one did a better job at keeping our interest while the other made our minds wander in between light saber duel scenes. Well this film was a good film with a great conclusion, fun fight sequences and is a good film to add to the Star Wars original trilogy.

    "There's only one return, you f*****g morons, and it's not 'of the King,' it's 'of the Jedi!'" - Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson), in "Clerks II" (2006)

    As far as I'm concerned, I think Randal's right. There's really only one "Return" that I prefer to watch over & over again and that's "Return of the Jedi," directed in 1983 by the late Richard Marquand and is the final film in the original "Star Wars" trilogy. We should all know by now that Kevin Smith is a staunch "Star Wars" loyalist, so I won't fault him there. I honestly have nothing personal against the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy that was so meticulously constructed by Peter Jackson from J.R.R. Tolkien's landmark fantasy novels; it's just that I'm a life-long "Star Wars" geek and Jackson had it comparatively easier in trying to get those movies made, not to mention a deeply entrenched fan-base supporting his efforts. "Star Wars" creator George Lucas had to start from scratch and fight an uphill battle almost every step of the way to get "Star Wars" (1977) and its sequels to the screen, with little help or backing from the studio and most of all, almost no one believed in his story or vision, creativity or ingenuity. And only now, more than a quarter of a century later, do people finally "get" the significance of "Star Wars" and what Lucas achieved in 1977. "Return of the Jedi," for the longest time, was probably my favorite of the original trilogy; astute readers will realize "The Empire Strikes Back" (1980) is my favorite "Star Wars" film all around (2005's "Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith" is the best from the prequel trilogy, in my opinion). At different times, I've considered all the original films a "favorite," but a long while ago I realized the towering achievement and perfection that was "The Empire Strikes Back." Like everyone else, I'll mostly agree that "Return of the Jedi" is by far the weakest of the original trilogy. But that does not mean it's bad or even remotely disappointing. In fact, it's actually very good and very much a thrilling science fiction adventure film from start to finish. I guess the primary reason "Return" suffers in comparison is because it appears to be somewhat of a step down in terms of what was achieved in "Star Wars" and "The Empire Strikes Back." A lot of people seem to criticize the lighter, more family-friendly root that Lucas's story took in this film, most notably with the inclusion of the cute & cuddly Ewoks of forest-moon Endor (which aren't nearly as bad as some people would make them out to be and they do provide some light comic relief during the otherwise intense battle scenes toward the end) and the cleaner resolution for the overall saga. This was a swift change considering the darker story and direction that George Lucas decided to take with "The Empire Strikes Back." The film still flies high on its revolutionary special effects - which, 30 years later, still knock most of the CGI-laden spectacles of 2013 Hollywood out of the water - captivating story, entrenched multi-dimensional characters, and brilliant action sequences. "Return of the Jedi" is still a first-degree special effects spectacle. 10/10

    The trilogy that marked and changed cinema forever, that gave George Lucas an huge success, and in this last chapter Lucas once again ask the help of Lawrence Kasdan on the script and delivery the direction to Richard Marquand. All together concludes with a golden key to the magnificent trilogy.....but unfortunately the movie nearly surpasses its magnificent predecessor. "Return" begins months after the events of the previous film with Han Solo (Harrison Ford) imprisoned in the palace of his great rival Jabba the Hutt. Luke (Mark Hamill) begins a rescue plan sending the droids R2 - D2 (Kenny Baker) and C - 3PO (Anthony Daniels) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) as bait while Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Lando (Billy Dee Williams) come infiltrated, Lando as soldier and Leia as bounty hunter. Soon after the great rescue, the group joins with the rebels and begins to know that the Empire is rebuilding the battleship "Death Star" under the command of Darth Vader (David Prowse) and begin to dominate the galaxy. The rebels now begin a massive plan to destroy the "Death Star" and finally put an end to the war. But Luke, with the instruction of Yoda (Frank Oz) and Obi - Wan (Alec Guinness), knows that Vader is not the monster that appears to be and begins to try to bring him to the good side of the "force". Such a task will be difficult with the cruel Emperor (Ian McDiarmid) controlling the mind of Vader with the dark side of the force strong in his side. The film never gets to be awful or terrible, as I said before, Lucas and his coworkers end the trilogy perfectly but the film suffers from a serious problem. Since the beginning of the film to the last moment with Yoda (unfortunately) the film flowed superbly, well written and directed by keeping the humor and well action packed. BUT, suddenly the plot jumped to the Rebel base nor explains how Han is feeling after his rescue and now we see very quickly the plan of attack against the Empire. And soon after, we see our beloved crew in the immense forest of Endor entering into a tense action sequence, the action is not a bad thing at all but the rush that the script took over there has a huge problem of narrative that in the end really hurt the film, but everything is reward with a thrilling and exciting final act. Even with a certain problem in the script at the 2nd act, "Return of the Jedi" is a worthy conclusion to one of the best trilogies ever made, thanks to Lucas that since the beginning redefined the genre of sci - fi forever giving her unforgettable characters with an incredible evolution; thanks to stunning visuals effects giving stunning and unforgettable scenarios;, thanks to John Williams with his unforgettable and powerful soundtrack. The trilogy that not only gave us absolute entertainment and genuinely tense moments, but also taught us that we can always reach our dreams just fighting, we all despite the problems and sins can redeem us and that if we all get together despite our different races can destroy all the forces of evil. "Return of the Jedi" doesn't surpasses its predecessors, but is a thrilling and epic conclusion to the trilogy that changed cinema forever. 9/10

    Episode VI(as it was retitled) is a very entertaining end to the original trilogy, which picks up the plot threads from the previous entry, which sees Luke rescuing both Han Solo and Princess Leia from the clutches of the vile Jabba The Hut(exciting sequence) then regroup on the moon of Endor, where one last, devastating attack on the empire is planned, even though the evil Emperor knows all about it, and will use Darth Vader's connection to Luke to destroy them once and for all... For the most part, a satisfying end to the story, is a lot of fun, though hurt because (1) the Ewoks are too cuddly and childish, especially when seen as an adult, in conjunction with the other installments, and (2) The story is uninspired to an extent, being a virtual reprise of the end of 'A New Hope'. Still, this wouldn't bother kids, especially myself on first viewing, who just loved it, and watched them all over and over!

    Return Of The Jedi is the worst Star Wars film. Many may be surprised to hear this, but Return Of The Jedi is definitely the Star Wars film I enjoy the least. The film is hurt by the first third of the film, the rescue of Han Solo. It does nothing to proceed the plot, it's overly long, it's filled with ridiculous things (droid torturing) as well as unnecessary action scenes (Rancor fight) and prevents the film from dealing with more relevant stuff. Additionally, all characters except for Luke Skywalker are abandoned. Han Solo has become a caricature who gets nothing to do after he has been freed. Leia, who had potential, was let down by the writers and had to stay on Endor and become as redundant as Han Solo. Her family history has been wasted. The second Death Star is unoriginal and boring. Luke, the Emperor and the fate of Darth Vader are the only redeeming qualities of the film. But that's 30% at best. 5 stars.

Where the film does succeed is a sense of humour when the first half concentrates on the droids R2D2 and the camp and cowardly C3PO as they find themselves at the mercy of Jabba . Some fans of the series might complain that this loses some of the darkness that EMPIRE contained but as someone who isn't this was welcomed by me since it makes the film more watchable as a neutral audience member The story then jumps to the forest world of Endor which is populated by Ewoks .

I was never taken too much by the STAR WARS films though I was impressed by the costume design and I can see why so many people fell in love with the original movies . They are entertaining where the story telling and special effects compliment one another rather than the story being written around the effects and set pieces as happens in so many films in the 21st Century so even for nostalgic reasons I can understand he affection the films are held in . Just a pity Lucas had to go and ruin things by later making a trilogy of product placement

    Star Wars: Episode VI- Return of the Jedi is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline,a terrific cast like their always is in Star Wars and fantastic and extremely lovable characters.This movie is definitely not as good as A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back,but I was still very pleased with this finale and it was a great send off for these characters,especially for Darth Vader.I think the main problem is that it got a bit too cute and lost a lot of the darkness from the previous films,mainly with the Ewoks,although they really were adorable.Fans of the original Star Wars trilogy won't like it as much as the previous two,but will still very pleased with this fitting finale. In his final adventure against the Empire,Luke must save Han Solo and the rest of the crew from Jabba the Hutt,destroy the second Death Star and face the fact his father Anakin Skywalker has been taken over by Darth Vader.

    Grade: B Star Wars The Return of the Jedi is a good, solid ending to the series as it has entertaining moments, a good conclusion, and raps it up nice and clean to please the audience, adding a cuddly new character and meeting the Emperor for the first and only time. The film is good, but with everything, I only would give it a B, I feel like that's what it deserves. It starts with Leia, disguised as a bounty hunter, entering Jabba the Hutt's palace, as he holds Han's frozen body as a trophy for not paying him back. She frees him, and Luke appears too, but he puts Luke in a pit, and Leia as his slave, but Luke wins, then he and Han are captured and now are going to be given to an animal living in the sand, but R2-D2, who was there with Leia, has Luke's light saber and shoots it to him and they fight, but the disappointing part is that even with all this protection and whatever you call it, Jabba is killed my Leia just chocking his big fat neck with her chains when he is not looking. They escape and Jango Fett is killed by being fed to the sand creature. Luke then goes to Dagobah and Luke and meets Yoda for the final time as Yoda dies and he sees Ben's spirit again to discuss about Darth Vader. Then they meet as they are coming up with a plan to destroy the new Death Star, and to end the war. Luke will go up into the Death Star to face Vader, Leia and Han will destroy the base on the planet, and the Rebels will fight the Sith in space and detonate the ship/planet. On the planet is fine and also in space, the real enjoyment was in the Death Star as Luke confronts Vader and the Emperor. He then fights Darth Vader and the Emperor and Vader try to bring out the dark side in Luke. They come close as Luke cuts Vader's hand off, but then calms down and refuses to join the Dark Side and the Emperor electrifies him and he starts screaming in agony. Vader stands up and watches his own son being tortured by his master. Then, one the greatest moments in the series, grabs the Emperor and throws him off the balcony to his death, but then he starts dying. Luke takes Vader to an escape ship and takes off Vader's mask since he wants to see his son for the first time. It's rather touching, but disappointing as the whole time you would be expecting James Earl Jones' face under that mask, but it wasn't. Vader dies and takes the body to the planet and flees as the Rebel's blow up the Death Star, ending the war. They celebrate on the planet, and Luke sees the spirits of Yoda, Ben, and his father Anakin (in the old version, he's old, in the new version, he's younger). The Phantom Menace copied this movie with its finale, and both very really interesting all around, there was always that one that stood out, but this one did a better job at keeping our interest while the other made our minds wander in between light saber duel scenes. Well this film was a good film with a great conclusion, fun fight sequences and is a good film to add to the Star Wars original trilogy.

    As far as I'm concerned, I think Randal's right. There's really only one "Return" that I prefer to watch over & over again and that's "Return of the Jedi," directed in 1983 by the late Richard Marquand and is the final film in the original "Star Wars" trilogy. We should all know by now that Kevin Smith is a staunch "Star Wars" loyalist, so I won't fault him there. I honestly have nothing personal against the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy that was so meticulously constructed by Peter Jackson from J.R.R. Tolkien's landmark fantasy novels; it's just that I'm a life-long "Star Wars" geek and Jackson had it comparatively easier in trying to get those movies made, not to mention a deeply entrenched fan-base supporting his efforts. "Star Wars" creator George Lucas had to start from scratch and fight an uphill battle almost every step of the way to get "Star Wars" (1977) and its sequels to the screen, with little help or backing from the studio and most of all, almost no one believed in his story or vision, creativity or ingenuity. And only now, more than a quarter of a century later, do people finally "get" the significance of "Star Wars" and what Lucas achieved in 1977. "Return of the Jedi," for the longest time, was probably my favorite of the original trilogy; astute readers will realize "The Empire Strikes Back" (1980) is my favorite "Star Wars" film all around (2005's "Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith" is the best from the prequel trilogy, in my opinion). At different times, I've considered all the original films a "favorite," but a long while ago I realized the towering achievement and perfection that was "The Empire Strikes Back." Like everyone else, I'll mostly agree that "Return of the Jedi" is by far the weakest of the original trilogy. But that does not mean it's bad or even remotely disappointing. In fact, it's actually very good and very much a thrilling science fiction adventure film from start to finish. I guess the primary reason "Return" suffers in comparison is because it appears to be somewhat of a step down in terms of what was achieved in "Star Wars" and "The Empire Strikes Back." A lot of people seem to criticize the lighter, more family-friendly root that Lucas's story took in this film, most notably with the inclusion of the cute & cuddly Ewoks of forest-moon Endor (which aren't nearly as bad as some people would make them out to be and they do provide some light comic relief during the otherwise intense battle scenes toward the end) and the cleaner resolution for the overall saga. This was a swift change considering the darker story and direction that George Lucas decided to take with "The Empire Strikes Back." The film still flies high on its revolutionary special effects - which, 30 years later, still knock most of the CGI-laden spectacles of 2013 Hollywood out of the water - captivating story, entrenched multi-dimensional characters, and brilliant action sequences. "Return of the Jedi" is still a first-degree special effects spectacle. 10/10

    The trilogy that marked and changed cinema forever, that gave George Lucas an huge success, and in this last chapter Lucas once again ask the help of Lawrence Kasdan on the script and delivery the direction to Richard Marquand. All together concludes with a golden key to the magnificent trilogy.....but unfortunately the movie nearly surpasses its magnificent predecessor. "Return" begins months after the events of the previous film with Han Solo (Harrison Ford) imprisoned in the palace of his great rival Jabba the Hutt. Luke (Mark Hamill) begins a rescue plan sending the droids R2 - D2 (Kenny Baker) and C - 3PO (Anthony Daniels) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) as bait while Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Lando (Billy Dee Williams) come infiltrated, Lando as soldier and Leia as bounty hunter. Soon after the great rescue, the group joins with the rebels and begins to know that the Empire is rebuilding the battleship "Death Star" under the command of Darth Vader (David Prowse) and begin to dominate the galaxy. The rebels now begin a massive plan to destroy the "Death Star" and finally put an end to the war. But Luke, with the instruction of Yoda (Frank Oz) and Obi - Wan (Alec Guinness), knows that Vader is not the monster that appears to be and begins to try to bring him to the good side of the "force". Such a task will be difficult with the cruel Emperor (Ian McDiarmid) controlling the mind of Vader with the dark side of the force strong in his side. The film never gets to be awful or terrible, as I said before, Lucas and his coworkers end the trilogy perfectly but the film suffers from a serious problem. Since the beginning of the film to the last moment with Yoda (unfortunately) the film flowed superbly, well written and directed by keeping the humor and well action packed. BUT, suddenly the plot jumped to the Rebel base nor explains how Han is feeling after his rescue and now we see very quickly the plan of attack against the Empire. And soon after, we see our beloved crew in the immense forest of Endor entering into a tense action sequence, the action is not a bad thing at all but the rush that the script took over there has a huge problem of narrative that in the end really hurt the film, but everything is reward with a thrilling and exciting final act. Even with a certain problem in the script at the 2nd act, "Return of the Jedi" is a worthy conclusion to one of the best trilogies ever made, thanks to Lucas that since the beginning redefined the genre of sci - fi forever giving her unforgettable characters with an incredible evolution; thanks to stunning visuals effects giving stunning and unforgettable scenarios;, thanks to John Williams with his unforgettable and powerful soundtrack. The trilogy that not only gave us absolute entertainment and genuinely tense moments, but also taught us that we can always reach our dreams just fighting, we all despite the problems and sins can redeem us and that if we all get together despite our different races can destroy all the forces of evil. "Return of the Jedi" doesn't surpasses its predecessors, but is a thrilling and epic conclusion to the trilogy that changed cinema forever. 9/10

    Episode VI(as it was retitled) is a very entertaining end to the original trilogy, which picks up the plot threads from the previous entry, which sees Luke rescuing both Han Solo and Princess Leia from the clutches of the vile Jabba The Hut(exciting sequence) then regroup on the moon of Endor, where one last, devastating attack on the empire is planned, even though the evil Emperor knows all about it, and will use Darth Vader's connection to Luke to destroy them once and for all... For the most part, a satisfying end to the story, is a lot of fun, though hurt because (1) the Ewoks are too cuddly and childish, especially when seen as an adult, in conjunction with the other installments, and (2) The story is uninspired to an extent, being a virtual reprise of the end of 'A New Hope'. Still, this wouldn't bother kids, especially myself on first viewing, who just loved it, and watched them all over and over!

    Return Of The Jedi is the worst Star Wars film. Many may be surprised to hear this, but Return Of The Jedi is definitely the Star Wars film I enjoy the least. The film is hurt by the first third of the film, the rescue of Han Solo. It does nothing to proceed the plot, it's overly long, it's filled with ridiculous things (droid torturing) as well as unnecessary action scenes (Rancor fight) and prevents the film from dealing with more relevant stuff. Additionally, all characters except for Luke Skywalker are abandoned. Han Solo has become a caricature who gets nothing to do after he has been freed. Leia, who had potential, was let down by the writers and had to stay on Endor and become as redundant as Han Solo. Her family history has been wasted. The second Death Star is unoriginal and boring. Luke, the Emperor and the fate of Darth Vader are the only redeeming qualities of the film. But that's 30% at best. 5 stars.

    Really the finale of Star Wars was not meant to be in the trilogy of the original at the time. As the new movies would take place sixteen years with a prequel. But still it is very enjoyable after Han Solo is frozen after the Empire Strikes Back. Luke Skywalker now knowing Darth Vader is his estranged father has a lot on his plate. While after Solo is rescued by Leia, Lando, and Luke, they must defeat the now invincible Death Star. But in order to do that, Luke must face his father reluctantly. Plus if he defeats his father, will officially become a Jedi as he is told by a dying Yoda and finds out he has a secret twin sister. Great finale to the trilogy or is it? As the prequel would not happen until sixteen years later. Hate it that Hamil and Fisher never got passed the post Star Wars stardom that Harrison Ford did later on in life. Very funny and action packed of the finale!

    George Lucas and company bring closure to the lives of the original beloved characters in this admittedly long and episodic but compelling 6th chapter. It's an emotional journey, to be sure, more emotional than the first two films, but it offers enough excitement and humour to make it great diversionary entertainment. The actors settle into their old roles comfortably and are very well supported by a rich variety of human and alien characters. With the directing reins now turned over to Richard Marquand (hired for this gig based on his direction of the thriller "Eye of the Needle"), the story is broken into a few major set pieces. Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Lando Calrissian and others reunite to rescue their good friend Han Solo from the decadent palace of loathsome alien slug Jabba the Hutt, the powerful crime kingpin for whom Han had once smuggled goods. The action moves to Dagobah, where Luke confronts Yoda over the matter of his parentage, and on to the woodsy moon of Endor where the Rebels are plotting to destroy the shield that the Empire is using to protect its latest Death Star battle station. And Luke finally has the confrontation with his father Darth Vader and the deadly, seductive Emperor (a deliciously evil Ian McDiarmid) that Ben and Yoda had insisted would be inevitable. While lacking the innovative nature of the first film, and dark, more mature quality of the second, this entry does bring a satisfying conclusion to the saga, in the spirit of those old adventure serials of decades past. John Williams' music is as rousing as it's ever been, and the filmmakers once again plunge us into an assortment of different environments (desert, swamp, forest, etc.) The chase and battle sequences are truly breathtaking and impressive. The early scenes in Jabbas' palace allow the creature and makeup departments to come up with moments that can rival the memorable cantina segment from "Star Wars". That brings this review to the matter of the Ewoks, those fuzzy teddy bears whom a fair amount of the audience profess to hate. All this viewer can say is that he's never had a problem with them. Particularly enjoyable is the resolution to Luke's relationship with Vader, as the black clad villain rediscovers his humanity when forced to make a choice. Of course, I would be remiss if I didn't bring up certain scenes with Leia, which have intrigued scores of boys and men over the years. "Return of the Jedi" may not be as good as its predecessors overall, but it's still quite a bit of fun. Eight out of 10.

    While not as derided as the three prequels, this final film of the original trilogy isn't held in as high a regard as Episodes IV and V. But for the life of me, I can't really think why. Yes, the Ewoks feel like kiddie-friendly merchandising opportunities but are they more annoying than, say, Jar-Jar Binks? If anything, the film largely dispenses with story-telling and focuses on wrapping everything up in a vast, effects-driven climatic action sequence or two. Certainly, there are no earth-shattering revelations that lifted "Empire Strikes Back" or a moment as jaw-dropping as the original attack on the Death Star in "A New Hope" but there are still plenty of moments to savour from the opening scenes to the very last shot. In a galaxy far away, the Rebel Alliance is at a crossroads. With the Empire constructing a new Death Star, a small Rebel fleet is amassing to launch a suicide mission to destroy it but our heroes have more pressing needs - Han Solo (Harrison Ford) is held captive in Jabba the Hutt's palace and after Lando (Billy Dee Williams) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) go missing trying to rescue him, R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) are sent forth to try. But it's Luke (Mark Hamill) who has the most to deal with - coming to terms with the devastating news about Darth Vader (David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones), Luke returns to Dagobah to complete his Jedi training with the dying Yoda (Frank Oz) but soon finds more information about his family, his destiny and the part in the plans of the frail Emperor (Ian McDiarmid)... "Return Of The Jedi" is probably my favourite Star Wars film of all because I am an action fan and can think of few things better than the rescue of Han from Jabba's palace. It has everything - model work, puppets of an extraordinary standard, a believable melting pot of alien life and language, danger, adventure, sex (who knew Carrie Fisher could look THAT good?) and that rousing soundtrack whenever a light-sabre is fired up. In a sense, the movie slows down a bit until the final reel when the Rebels take the fight to the Death Star once again. However, I do have to point out a couple of things I didn't like - the first of which are the Ewoks. Are they really a match for, as the Emperor himself put it, "an entire legion of my best troops" and the sub-plot about C-3PO being mistaken as a god felt tacky and badly written (surprise, surprise). I also felt Williams was underused as Lando and all-too-quickly forgiven for his betrayal in the previous film. Dialogue is also a sticking point but with all Star Wars films, you expect lines like "I have a bad feeling about this". But such trivial points cannot stop me from enjoying this. "Return Of The Jedi" is an old-fashioned adventure movie full of characters we've known and loved for the last couple of movies. It may lack some of the ambition or originality of the earlier movies but it still feels like a complete and full universe, bursting with characters that teem with life and stories that go begging to be told. My favourite moment, possibly of the whole saga, is when the great Rancor's keeper comes out to check his beloved beastie after his meeting with Luke. He sobs and shakes his head with genuine sadness for the enormous ugly brute we were repulsed by mere seconds before. It's a moment that goes largely unnoticed and is probably forgotten by most viewers (especially one Leia appears in that gold bikini get-up) but it shows how much depth, thought and real love there is in these films. I can never tire of watching the original trilogy and this one in particular. It may be the weakest of the three originals but personally, it is my favourite because even as Luke wrestles with Vader and the Emperor's attempts to turn him to the Dark Side, you're with him every inch of the way. It's a glorious end to the saga which, I fear, will only be weakened by the desperate money-hungry attempt to spin off another three films. Stick with Episodes IV - VI and enjoy.

"Return of the Jedi," for the longest time, was probably my favorite of the original trilogy; astute readers will realize "The Empire Strikes Back" (1980) is my favorite "Star Wars" film all around (2005's "Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith" is the best from the prequel trilogy, in my opinion). At different times, I've considered all the original films a "favorite," but a long while ago I realized the towering achievement and perfection that was "The Empire Strikes Back." Like everyone else, I'll mostly agree that "Return of the Jedi" is by far the weakest of the original trilogy. But that does not mean it's bad or even remotely disappointing. In fact, it's actually very good and very much a thrilling science fiction adventure film from start to finish. I guess the primary reason "Return" suffers in comparison is because it appears to be somewhat of a step down in terms of what was achieved in "Star Wars" and "The Empire Strikes Back." A lot of people seem to criticize the lighter, more family-friendly root that Lucas's story took in this film, most notably with the inclusion of the cute & cuddly Ewoks of forest-moon Endor (which aren't nearly as bad as some people would make them out to be and they do provide some light comic relief during the otherwise intense battle scenes toward the end) and the cleaner resolution for the overall saga. This was a swift change considering the darker story and direction that George Lucas decided to take with "The Empire Strikes Back." The film still flies high on its revolutionary special effects - which, 30 years later, still knock most of the CGI-laden spectacles of 2013 Hollywood out of the water - captivating story, entrenched multi-dimensional characters, and brilliant action sequences. "Return of the Jedi" is still a first-degree special effects spectacle. 10/10

    The trilogy that marked and changed cinema forever, that gave George Lucas an huge success, and in this last chapter Lucas once again ask the help of Lawrence Kasdan on the script and delivery the direction to Richard Marquand. All together concludes with a golden key to the magnificent trilogy.....but unfortunately the movie nearly surpasses its magnificent predecessor. "Return" begins months after the events of the previous film with Han Solo (Harrison Ford) imprisoned in the palace of his great rival Jabba the Hutt. Luke (Mark Hamill) begins a rescue plan sending the droids R2 - D2 (Kenny Baker) and C - 3PO (Anthony Daniels) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) as bait while Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Lando (Billy Dee Williams) come infiltrated, Lando as soldier and Leia as bounty hunter. Soon after the great rescue, the group joins with the rebels and begins to know that the Empire is rebuilding the battleship "Death Star" under the command of Darth Vader (David Prowse) and begin to dominate the galaxy. The rebels now begin a massive plan to destroy the "Death Star" and finally put an end to the war. But Luke, with the instruction of Yoda (Frank Oz) and Obi - Wan (Alec Guinness), knows that Vader is not the monster that appears to be and begins to try to bring him to the good side of the "force". Such a task will be difficult with the cruel Emperor (Ian McDiarmid) controlling the mind of Vader with the dark side of the force strong in his side. The film never gets to be awful or terrible, as I said before, Lucas and his coworkers end the trilogy perfectly but the film suffers from a serious problem. Since the beginning of the film to the last moment with Yoda (unfortunately) the film flowed superbly, well written and directed by keeping the humor and well action packed. BUT, suddenly the plot jumped to the Rebel base nor explains how Han is feeling after his rescue and now we see very quickly the plan of attack against the Empire. And soon after, we see our beloved crew in the immense forest of Endor entering into a tense action sequence, the action is not a bad thing at all but the rush that the script took over there has a huge problem of narrative that in the end really hurt the film, but everything is reward with a thrilling and exciting final act. Even with a certain problem in the script at the 2nd act, "Return of the Jedi" is a worthy conclusion to one of the best trilogies ever made, thanks to Lucas that since the beginning redefined the genre of sci - fi forever giving her unforgettable characters with an incredible evolution; thanks to stunning visuals effects giving stunning and unforgettable scenarios;, thanks to John Williams with his unforgettable and powerful soundtrack. The trilogy that not only gave us absolute entertainment and genuinely tense moments, but also taught us that we can always reach our dreams just fighting, we all despite the problems and sins can redeem us and that if we all get together despite our different races can destroy all the forces of evil. "Return of the Jedi" doesn't surpasses its predecessors, but is a thrilling and epic conclusion to the trilogy that changed cinema forever. 9/10

    Episode VI(as it was retitled) is a very entertaining end to the original trilogy, which picks up the plot threads from the previous entry, which sees Luke rescuing both Han Solo and Princess Leia from the clutches of the vile Jabba The Hut(exciting sequence) then regroup on the moon of Endor, where one last, devastating attack on the empire is planned, even though the evil Emperor knows all about it, and will use Darth Vader's connection to Luke to destroy them once and for all... For the most part, a satisfying end to the story, is a lot of fun, though hurt because (1) the Ewoks are too cuddly and childish, especially when seen as an adult, in conjunction with the other installments, and (2) The story is uninspired to an extent, being a virtual reprise of the end of 'A New Hope'. Still, this wouldn't bother kids, especially myself on first viewing, who just loved it, and watched them all over and over!

    Return Of The Jedi is the worst Star Wars film. Many may be surprised to hear this, but Return Of The Jedi is definitely the Star Wars film I enjoy the least. The film is hurt by the first third of the film, the rescue of Han Solo. It does nothing to proceed the plot, it's overly long, it's filled with ridiculous things (droid torturing) as well as unnecessary action scenes (Rancor fight) and prevents the film from dealing with more relevant stuff. Additionally, all characters except for Luke Skywalker are abandoned. Han Solo has become a caricature who gets nothing to do after he has been freed. Leia, who had potential, was let down by the writers and had to stay on Endor and become as redundant as Han Solo. Her family history has been wasted. The second Death Star is unoriginal and boring. Luke, the Emperor and the fate of Darth Vader are the only redeeming qualities of the film. But that's 30% at best. 5 stars.

    Really the finale of Star Wars was not meant to be in the trilogy of the original at the time. As the new movies would take place sixteen years with a prequel. But still it is very enjoyable after Han Solo is frozen after the Empire Strikes Back. Luke Skywalker now knowing Darth Vader is his estranged father has a lot on his plate. While after Solo is rescued by Leia, Lando, and Luke, they must defeat the now invincible Death Star. But in order to do that, Luke must face his father reluctantly. Plus if he defeats his father, will officially become a Jedi as he is told by a dying Yoda and finds out he has a secret twin sister. Great finale to the trilogy or is it? As the prequel would not happen until sixteen years later. Hate it that Hamil and Fisher never got passed the post Star Wars stardom that Harrison Ford did later on in life. Very funny and action packed of the finale!

    George Lucas and company bring closure to the lives of the original beloved characters in this admittedly long and episodic but compelling 6th chapter. It's an emotional journey, to be sure, more emotional than the first two films, but it offers enough excitement and humour to make it great diversionary entertainment. The actors settle into their old roles comfortably and are very well supported by a rich variety of human and alien characters. With the directing reins now turned over to Richard Marquand (hired for this gig based on his direction of the thriller "Eye of the Needle"), the story is broken into a few major set pieces. Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Lando Calrissian and others reunite to rescue their good friend Han Solo from the decadent palace of loathsome alien slug Jabba the Hutt, the powerful crime kingpin for whom Han had once smuggled goods. The action moves to Dagobah, where Luke confronts Yoda over the matter of his parentage, and on to the woodsy moon of Endor where the Rebels are plotting to destroy the shield that the Empire is using to protect its latest Death Star battle station. And Luke finally has the confrontation with his father Darth Vader and the deadly, seductive Emperor (a deliciously evil Ian McDiarmid) that Ben and Yoda had insisted would be inevitable. While lacking the innovative nature of the first film, and dark, more mature quality of the second, this entry does bring a satisfying conclusion to the saga, in the spirit of those old adventure serials of decades past. John Williams' music is as rousing as it's ever been, and the filmmakers once again plunge us into an assortment of different environments (desert, swamp, forest, etc.) The chase and battle sequences are truly breathtaking and impressive. The early scenes in Jabbas' palace allow the creature and makeup departments to come up with moments that can rival the memorable cantina segment from "Star Wars". That brings this review to the matter of the Ewoks, those fuzzy teddy bears whom a fair amount of the audience profess to hate. All this viewer can say is that he's never had a problem with them. Particularly enjoyable is the resolution to Luke's relationship with Vader, as the black clad villain rediscovers his humanity when forced to make a choice. Of course, I would be remiss if I didn't bring up certain scenes with Leia, which have intrigued scores of boys and men over the years. "Return of the Jedi" may not be as good as its predecessors overall, but it's still quite a bit of fun. Eight out of 10.

    While not as derided as the three prequels, this final film of the original trilogy isn't held in as high a regard as Episodes IV and V. But for the life of me, I can't really think why. Yes, the Ewoks feel like kiddie-friendly merchandising opportunities but are they more annoying than, say, Jar-Jar Binks? If anything, the film largely dispenses with story-telling and focuses on wrapping everything up in a vast, effects-driven climatic action sequence or two. Certainly, there are no earth-shattering revelations that lifted "Empire Strikes Back" or a moment as jaw-dropping as the original attack on the Death Star in "A New Hope" but there are still plenty of moments to savour from the opening scenes to the very last shot. In a galaxy far away, the Rebel Alliance is at a crossroads. With the Empire constructing a new Death Star, a small Rebel fleet is amassing to launch a suicide mission to destroy it but our heroes have more pressing needs - Han Solo (Harrison Ford) is held captive in Jabba the Hutt's palace and after Lando (Billy Dee Williams) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) go missing trying to rescue him, R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) are sent forth to try. But it's Luke (Mark Hamill) who has the most to deal with - coming to terms with the devastating news about Darth Vader (David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones), Luke returns to Dagobah to complete his Jedi training with the dying Yoda (Frank Oz) but soon finds more information about his family, his destiny and the part in the plans of the frail Emperor (Ian McDiarmid)... "Return Of The Jedi" is probably my favourite Star Wars film of all because I am an action fan and can think of few things better than the rescue of Han from Jabba's palace. It has everything - model work, puppets of an extraordinary standard, a believable melting pot of alien life and language, danger, adventure, sex (who knew Carrie Fisher could look THAT good?) and that rousing soundtrack whenever a light-sabre is fired up. In a sense, the movie slows down a bit until the final reel when the Rebels take the fight to the Death Star once again. However, I do have to point out a couple of things I didn't like - the first of which are the Ewoks. Are they really a match for, as the Emperor himself put it, "an entire legion of my best troops" and the sub-plot about C-3PO being mistaken as a god felt tacky and badly written (surprise, surprise). I also felt Williams was underused as Lando and all-too-quickly forgiven for his betrayal in the previous film. Dialogue is also a sticking point but with all Star Wars films, you expect lines like "I have a bad feeling about this". But such trivial points cannot stop me from enjoying this. "Return Of The Jedi" is an old-fashioned adventure movie full of characters we've known and loved for the last couple of movies. It may lack some of the ambition or originality of the earlier movies but it still feels like a complete and full universe, bursting with characters that teem with life and stories that go begging to be told. My favourite moment, possibly of the whole saga, is when the great Rancor's keeper comes out to check his beloved beastie after his meeting with Luke. He sobs and shakes his head with genuine sadness for the enormous ugly brute we were repulsed by mere seconds before. It's a moment that goes largely unnoticed and is probably forgotten by most viewers (especially one Leia appears in that gold bikini get-up) but it shows how much depth, thought and real love there is in these films. I can never tire of watching the original trilogy and this one in particular. It may be the weakest of the three originals but personally, it is my favourite because even as Luke wrestles with Vader and the Emperor's attempts to turn him to the Dark Side, you're with him every inch of the way. It's a glorious end to the saga which, I fear, will only be weakened by the desperate money-hungry attempt to spin off another three films. Stick with Episodes IV - VI and enjoy.

    Amazing to think that this was once considered the weak link of the original ST trilogy . Time has told us that THE PHANTOM MENACE and its two follow ups shows us that that there's a sucker born every minute who will watch any old rubbish if it ties in with STAR WARS . While watching RETURN OF THE JEDI I was struck as to how impressive it was in its own right never mind compared to the prequels spewed up by Lucas but also how superior it was to James Cameron's AVATAR a film that owes a lot to this one Story wise JEDI is no great shakes , being just a retread of the most part of the first film where The Imperial Empire are building a Death Star and the Rebel Alliance trying to stop them . Where the film does succeed is a sense of humour when the first half concentrates on the droids R2D2 and the camp and cowardly C3PO as they find themselves at the mercy of Jabba . Some fans of the series might complain that this loses some of the darkness that EMPIRE contained but as someone who isn't this was welcomed by me since it makes the film more watchable as a neutral audience member The story then jumps to the forest world of Endor which is populated by Ewoks . Lucas is on record as saying a technologically advanced power being beaten by a backward guerrilla force was inspired by Vietnam and you can see the parallels to an extent and while you won't be reminded of APOCALYPSE NOW you are aware that that Cameron had the same idea with AVATAR but at least the scenes on Endor don't suffer from the ponderous effects laden self importance we got with Cameron RETURN OF THE JEDI ends the trilogy that became part of a great number of peoples childhoods . I was never taken too much by the STAR WARS films though I was impressed by the costume design and I can see why so many people fell in love with the original movies . They are entertaining where the story telling and special effects compliment one another rather than the story being written around the effects and set pieces as happens in so many films in the 21st Century so even for nostalgic reasons I can understand he affection the films are held in . Just a pity Lucas had to go and ruin things by later making a trilogy of product placement

    Star Wars: Episode VI- Return of the Jedi is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline,a terrific cast like their always is in Star Wars and fantastic and extremely lovable characters.This movie is definitely not as good as A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back,but I was still very pleased with this finale and it was a great send off for these characters,especially for Darth Vader.I think the main problem is that it got a bit too cute and lost a lot of the darkness from the previous films,mainly with the Ewoks,although they really were adorable.Fans of the original Star Wars trilogy won't like it as much as the previous two,but will still very pleased with this fitting finale. In his final adventure against the Empire,Luke must save Han Solo and the rest of the crew from Jabba the Hutt,destroy the second Death Star and face the fact his father Anakin Skywalker has been taken over by Darth Vader.

    Grade: B Star Wars The Return of the Jedi is a good, solid ending to the series as it has entertaining moments, a good conclusion, and raps it up nice and clean to please the audience, adding a cuddly new character and meeting the Emperor for the first and only time. The film is good, but with everything, I only would give it a B, I feel like that's what it deserves. It starts with Leia, disguised as a bounty hunter, entering Jabba the Hutt's palace, as he holds Han's frozen body as a trophy for not paying him back. She frees him, and Luke appears too, but he puts Luke in a pit, and Leia as his slave, but Luke wins, then he and Han are captured and now are going to be given to an animal living in the sand, but R2-D2, who was there with Leia, has Luke's light saber and shoots it to him and they fight, but the disappointing part is that even with all this protection and whatever you call it, Jabba is killed my Leia just chocking his big fat neck with her chains when he is not looking. They escape and Jango Fett is killed by being fed to the sand creature. Luke then goes to Dagobah and Luke and meets Yoda for the final time as Yoda dies and he sees Ben's spirit again to discuss about Darth Vader. Then they meet as they are coming up with a plan to destroy the new Death Star, and to end the war. Luke will go up into the Death Star to face Vader, Leia and Han will destroy the base on the planet, and the Rebels will fight the Sith in space and detonate the ship/planet. On the planet is fine and also in space, the real enjoyment was in the Death Star as Luke confronts Vader and the Emperor. He then fights Darth Vader and the Emperor and Vader try to bring out the dark side in Luke. They come close as Luke cuts Vader's hand off, but then calms down and refuses to join the Dark Side and the Emperor electrifies him and he starts screaming in agony. Vader stands up and watches his own son being tortured by his master. Then, one the greatest moments in the series, grabs the Emperor and throws him off the balcony to his death, but then he starts dying. Luke takes Vader to an escape ship and takes off Vader's mask since he wants to see his son for the first time. It's rather touching, but disappointing as the whole time you would be expecting James Earl Jones' face under that mask, but it wasn't. Vader dies and takes the body to the planet and flees as the Rebel's blow up the Death Star, ending the war. They celebrate on the planet, and Luke sees the spirits of Yoda, Ben, and his father Anakin (in the old version, he's old, in the new version, he's younger). The Phantom Menace copied this movie with its finale, and both very really interesting all around, there was always that one that stood out, but this one did a better job at keeping our interest while the other made our minds wander in between light saber duel scenes. Well this film was a good film with a great conclusion, fun fight sequences and is a good film to add to the Star Wars original trilogy.

    As far as I'm concerned, I think Randal's right. There's really only one "Return" that I prefer to watch over & over again and that's "Return of the Jedi," directed in 1983 by the late Richard Marquand and is the final film in the original "Star Wars" trilogy. We should all know by now that Kevin Smith is a staunch "Star Wars" loyalist, so I won't fault him there. I honestly have nothing personal against the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy that was so meticulously constructed by Peter Jackson from J.R.R. Tolkien's landmark fantasy novels; it's just that I'm a life-long "Star Wars" geek and Jackson had it comparatively easier in trying to get those movies made, not to mention a deeply entrenched fan-base supporting his efforts. "Star Wars" creator George Lucas had to start from scratch and fight an uphill battle almost every step of the way to get "Star Wars" (1977) and its sequels to the screen, with little help or backing from the studio and most of all, almost no one believed in his story or vision, creativity or ingenuity. And only now, more than a quarter of a century later, do people finally "get" the significance of "Star Wars" and what Lucas achieved in 1977. "Return of the Jedi," for the longest time, was probably my favorite of the original trilogy; astute readers will realize "The Empire Strikes Back" (1980) is my favorite "Star Wars" film all around (2005's "Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith" is the best from the prequel trilogy, in my opinion).

Like everyone else, I'll mostly agree that "Return of the Jedi" is by far the weakest of the original trilogy. But that does not mean it's bad or even remotely disappointing. In fact, it's actually very good and very much a thrilling science fiction adventure film from start to finish. I guess the primary reason "Return" suffers in comparison is because it appears to be somewhat of a step down in terms of what was achieved in "Star Wars" and "The Empire Strikes Back." A lot of people seem to criticize the lighter, more family-friendly root that Lucas's story took in this film, most notably with the inclusion of the cute & cuddly Ewoks of forest-moon Endor (which aren't nearly as bad as some people would make them out to be and they do provide some light comic relief during the otherwise intense battle scenes toward the end) and the cleaner resolution for the overall saga.

    Really the finale of Star Wars was not meant to be in the trilogy of the original at the time. As the new movies would take place sixteen years with a prequel. But still it is very enjoyable after Han Solo is frozen after the Empire Strikes Back. Luke Skywalker now knowing Darth Vader is his estranged father has a lot on his plate. While after Solo is rescued by Leia, Lando, and Luke, they must defeat the now invincible Death Star. But in order to do that, Luke must face his father reluctantly. Plus if he defeats his father, will officially become a Jedi as he is told by a dying Yoda and finds out he has a secret twin sister. Great finale to the trilogy or is it? As the prequel would not happen until sixteen years later. Hate it that Hamil and Fisher never got passed the post Star Wars stardom that Harrison Ford did later on in life. Very funny and action packed of the finale!

    George Lucas and company bring closure to the lives of the original beloved characters in this admittedly long and episodic but compelling 6th chapter. It's an emotional journey, to be sure, more emotional than the first two films, but it offers enough excitement and humour to make it great diversionary entertainment. The actors settle into their old roles comfortably and are very well supported by a rich variety of human and alien characters. With the directing reins now turned over to Richard Marquand (hired for this gig based on his direction of the thriller "Eye of the Needle"), the story is broken into a few major set pieces. Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Lando Calrissian and others reunite to rescue their good friend Han Solo from the decadent palace of loathsome alien slug Jabba the Hutt, the powerful crime kingpin for whom Han had once smuggled goods. The action moves to Dagobah, where Luke confronts Yoda over the matter of his parentage, and on to the woodsy moon of Endor where the Rebels are plotting to destroy the shield that the Empire is using to protect its latest Death Star battle station. And Luke finally has the confrontation with his father Darth Vader and the deadly, seductive Emperor (a deliciously evil Ian McDiarmid) that Ben and Yoda had insisted would be inevitable. While lacking the innovative nature of the first film, and dark, more mature quality of the second, this entry does bring a satisfying conclusion to the saga, in the spirit of those old adventure serials of decades past. John Williams' music is as rousing as it's ever been, and the filmmakers once again plunge us into an assortment of different environments (desert, swamp, forest, etc.) The chase and battle sequences are truly breathtaking and impressive. The early scenes in Jabbas' palace allow the creature and makeup departments to come up with moments that can rival the memorable cantina segment from "Star Wars". That brings this review to the matter of the Ewoks, those fuzzy teddy bears whom a fair amount of the audience profess to hate. All this viewer can say is that he's never had a problem with them. Particularly enjoyable is the resolution to Luke's relationship with Vader, as the black clad villain rediscovers his humanity when forced to make a choice. Of course, I would be remiss if I didn't bring up certain scenes with Leia, which have intrigued scores of boys and men over the years. "Return of the Jedi" may not be as good as its predecessors overall, but it's still quite a bit of fun. Eight out of 10.

    While not as derided as the three prequels, this final film of the original trilogy isn't held in as high a regard as Episodes IV and V. But for the life of me, I can't really think why. Yes, the Ewoks feel like kiddie-friendly merchandising opportunities but are they more annoying than, say, Jar-Jar Binks? If anything, the film largely dispenses with story-telling and focuses on wrapping everything up in a vast, effects-driven climatic action sequence or two. Certainly, there are no earth-shattering revelations that lifted "Empire Strikes Back" or a moment as jaw-dropping as the original attack on the Death Star in "A New Hope" but there are still plenty of moments to savour from the opening scenes to the very last shot. In a galaxy far away, the Rebel Alliance is at a crossroads. With the Empire constructing a new Death Star, a small Rebel fleet is amassing to launch a suicide mission to destroy it but our heroes have more pressing needs - Han Solo (Harrison Ford) is held captive in Jabba the Hutt's palace and after Lando (Billy Dee Williams) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) go missing trying to rescue him, R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) are sent forth to try. But it's Luke (Mark Hamill) who has the most to deal with - coming to terms with the devastating news about Darth Vader (David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones), Luke returns to Dagobah to complete his Jedi training with the dying Yoda (Frank Oz) but soon finds more information about his family, his destiny and the part in the plans of the frail Emperor (Ian McDiarmid)... "Return Of The Jedi" is probably my favourite Star Wars film of all because I am an action fan and can think of few things better than the rescue of Han from Jabba's palace. It has everything - model work, puppets of an extraordinary standard, a believable melting pot of alien life and language, danger, adventure, sex (who knew Carrie Fisher could look THAT good?) and that rousing soundtrack whenever a light-sabre is fired up. In a sense, the movie slows down a bit until the final reel when the Rebels take the fight to the Death Star once again. However, I do have to point out a couple of things I didn't like - the first of which are the Ewoks. Are they really a match for, as the Emperor himself put it, "an entire legion of my best troops" and the sub-plot about C-3PO being mistaken as a god felt tacky and badly written (surprise, surprise). I also felt Williams was underused as Lando and all-too-quickly forgiven for his betrayal in the previous film. Dialogue is also a sticking point but with all Star Wars films, you expect lines like "I have a bad feeling about this". But such trivial points cannot stop me from enjoying this. "Return Of The Jedi" is an old-fashioned adventure movie full of characters we've known and loved for the last couple of movies. It may lack some of the ambition or originality of the earlier movies but it still feels like a complete and full universe, bursting with characters that teem with life and stories that go begging to be told. My favourite moment, possibly of the whole saga, is when the great Rancor's keeper comes out to check his beloved beastie after his meeting with Luke. He sobs and shakes his head with genuine sadness for the enormous ugly brute we were repulsed by mere seconds before. It's a moment that goes largely unnoticed and is probably forgotten by most viewers (especially one Leia appears in that gold bikini get-up) but it shows how much depth, thought and real love there is in these films. I can never tire of watching the original trilogy and this one in particular. It may be the weakest of the three originals but personally, it is my favourite because even as Luke wrestles with Vader and the Emperor's attempts to turn him to the Dark Side, you're with him every inch of the way. It's a glorious end to the saga which, I fear, will only be weakened by the desperate money-hungry attempt to spin off another three films. Stick with Episodes IV - VI and enjoy.

    Amazing to think that this was once considered the weak link of the original ST trilogy . Time has told us that THE PHANTOM MENACE and its two follow ups shows us that that there's a sucker born every minute who will watch any old rubbish if it ties in with STAR WARS . While watching RETURN OF THE JEDI I was struck as to how impressive it was in its own right never mind compared to the prequels spewed up by Lucas but also how superior it was to James Cameron's AVATAR a film that owes a lot to this one Story wise JEDI is no great shakes , being just a retread of the most part of the first film where The Imperial Empire are building a Death Star and the Rebel Alliance trying to stop them . Where the film does succeed is a sense of humour when the first half concentrates on the droids R2D2 and the camp and cowardly C3PO as they find themselves at the mercy of Jabba . Some fans of the series might complain that this loses some of the darkness that EMPIRE contained but as someone who isn't this was welcomed by me since it makes the film more watchable as a neutral audience member The story then jumps to the forest world of Endor which is populated by Ewoks . Lucas is on record as saying a technologically advanced power being beaten by a backward guerrilla force was inspired by Vietnam and you can see the parallels to an extent and while you won't be reminded of APOCALYPSE NOW you are aware that that Cameron had the same idea with AVATAR but at least the scenes on Endor don't suffer from the ponderous effects laden self importance we got with Cameron RETURN OF THE JEDI ends the trilogy that became part of a great number of peoples childhoods . I was never taken too much by the STAR WARS films though I was impressed by the costume design and I can see why so many people fell in love with the original movies . They are entertaining where the story telling and special effects compliment one another rather than the story being written around the effects and set pieces as happens in so many films in the 21st Century so even for nostalgic reasons I can understand he affection the films are held in . Just a pity Lucas had to go and ruin things by later making a trilogy of product placement

    Star Wars: Episode VI- Return of the Jedi is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline,a terrific cast like their always is in Star Wars and fantastic and extremely lovable characters.This movie is definitely not as good as A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back,but I was still very pleased with this finale and it was a great send off for these characters,especially for Darth Vader.I think the main problem is that it got a bit too cute and lost a lot of the darkness from the previous films,mainly with the Ewoks,although they really were adorable.Fans of the original Star Wars trilogy won't like it as much as the previous two,but will still very pleased with this fitting finale. In his final adventure against the Empire,Luke must save Han Solo and the rest of the crew from Jabba the Hutt,destroy the second Death Star and face the fact his father Anakin Skywalker has been taken over by Darth Vader.

    Grade: B Star Wars The Return of the Jedi is a good, solid ending to the series as it has entertaining moments, a good conclusion, and raps it up nice and clean to please the audience, adding a cuddly new character and meeting the Emperor for the first and only time. The film is good, but with everything, I only would give it a B, I feel like that's what it deserves. It starts with Leia, disguised as a bounty hunter, entering Jabba the Hutt's palace, as he holds Han's frozen body as a trophy for not paying him back. She frees him, and Luke appears too, but he puts Luke in a pit, and Leia as his slave, but Luke wins, then he and Han are captured and now are going to be given to an animal living in the sand, but R2-D2, who was there with Leia, has Luke's light saber and shoots it to him and they fight, but the disappointing part is that even with all this protection and whatever you call it, Jabba is killed my Leia just chocking his big fat neck with her chains when he is not looking. They escape and Jango Fett is killed by being fed to the sand creature. Luke then goes to Dagobah and Luke and meets Yoda for the final time as Yoda dies and he sees Ben's spirit again to discuss about Darth Vader. Then they meet as they are coming up with a plan to destroy the new Death Star, and to end the war. Luke will go up into the Death Star to face Vader, Leia and Han will destroy the base on the planet, and the Rebels will fight the Sith in space and detonate the ship/planet. On the planet is fine and also in space, the real enjoyment was in the Death Star as Luke confronts Vader and the Emperor. He then fights Darth Vader and the Emperor and Vader try to bring out the dark side in Luke. They come close as Luke cuts Vader's hand off, but then calms down and refuses to join the Dark Side and the Emperor electrifies him and he starts screaming in agony. Vader stands up and watches his own son being tortured by his master. Then, one the greatest moments in the series, grabs the Emperor and throws him off the balcony to his death, but then he starts dying. Luke takes Vader to an escape ship and takes off Vader's mask since he wants to see his son for the first time. It's rather touching, but disappointing as the whole time you would be expecting James Earl Jones' face under that mask, but it wasn't. Vader dies and takes the body to the planet and flees as the Rebel's blow up the Death Star, ending the war. They celebrate on the planet, and Luke sees the spirits of Yoda, Ben, and his father Anakin (in the old version, he's old, in the new version, he's younger). The Phantom Menace copied this movie with its finale, and both very really interesting all around, there was always that one that stood out, but this one did a better job at keeping our interest while the other made our minds wander in between light saber duel scenes. Well this film was a good film with a great conclusion, fun fight sequences and is a good film to add to the Star Wars original trilogy.

    "There's only one return, you f*****g morons, and it's not 'of the King,' it's 'of the Jedi!'" - Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson), in "Clerks II" (2006)

    As far as I'm concerned, I think Randal's right. There's really only one "Return" that I prefer to watch over & over again and that's "Return of the Jedi," directed in 1983 by the late Richard Marquand and is the final film in the original "Star Wars" trilogy. We should all know by now that Kevin Smith is a staunch "Star Wars" loyalist, so I won't fault him there. I honestly have nothing personal against the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy that was so meticulously constructed by Peter Jackson from J.R.R. Tolkien's landmark fantasy novels; it's just that I'm a life-long "Star Wars" geek and Jackson had it comparatively easier in trying to get those movies made, not to mention a deeply entrenched fan-base supporting his efforts. "Star Wars" creator George Lucas had to start from scratch and fight an uphill battle almost every step of the way to get "Star Wars" (1977) and its sequels to the screen, with little help or backing from the studio and most of all, almost no one believed in his story or vision, creativity or ingenuity. And only now, more than a quarter of a century later, do people finally "get" the significance of "Star Wars" and what Lucas achieved in 1977. "Return of the Jedi," for the longest time, was probably my favorite of the original trilogy; astute readers will realize "The Empire Strikes Back" (1980) is my favorite "Star Wars" film all around (2005's "Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith" is the best from the prequel trilogy, in my opinion). At different times, I've considered all the original films a "favorite," but a long while ago I realized the towering achievement and perfection that was "The Empire Strikes Back." Like everyone else, I'll mostly agree that "Return of the Jedi" is by far the weakest of the original trilogy. But that does not mean it's bad or even remotely disappointing. In fact, it's actually very good and very much a thrilling science fiction adventure film from start to finish. I guess the primary reason "Return" suffers in comparison is because it appears to be somewhat of a step down in terms of what was achieved in "Star Wars" and "The Empire Strikes Back." A lot of people seem to criticize the lighter, more family-friendly root that Lucas's story took in this film, most notably with the inclusion of the cute & cuddly Ewoks of forest-moon Endor (which aren't nearly as bad as some people would make them out to be and they do provide some light comic relief during the otherwise intense battle scenes toward the end) and the cleaner resolution for the overall saga. This was a swift change considering the darker story and direction that George Lucas decided to take with "The Empire Strikes Back." The film still flies high on its revolutionary special effects - which, 30 years later, still knock most of the CGI-laden spectacles of 2013 Hollywood out of the water - captivating story, entrenched multi-dimensional characters, and brilliant action sequences. "Return of the Jedi" is still a first-degree special effects spectacle. 10/10
