    The talking pig who made it big has got people here folks! He's just your average adorable little piglet, from a typical farm family. That is, until his parents and siblings have been taken away! Now he's off on an epic search in the city to find his folks! Along the way, he makes friends with two kids, and saves one of them from drowning! Gordy becomes famous for his actions of heroism, and becomes the CEO of a business! Eventually, with all the fame Gordy has attracted, he gets his own stamp! Meanwhile, an unscrupulous business man tries to take on Gordy and get rid of him! His henchman are told to kidnap him, tie him in a sack, and toss him in the river! But with the help of his new friends, they all figure out where his family's been taken to (a slaughterhouse in Omaha). They go there and successfully shut the sinister slaughterhouse down once and for all! And in the end, Gordy and his friends and family all get to live together on the farm forever! This seems to be a love-it or hate-it type movie. But I loved it! A sweet story, cute characters, and a precious piglet! This is one of the most underrated movies ever! It's beautiful and proves that no matter how small you may be, you can always make a difference! And it's NOT a rip-off of Babe. They are just as good and just happen to share some similarities.

    After reading such negative reviews on here, I just had to step in and write a review! Gordy came out when I was 6, so it was prime time for me. Gordy became one of my favorite movies, along with "The Road To El Dorado" and "The Lion King" and many more. Granted "Babe" was a big hit and a family favorite for many, I would say Gordy is just as good, if not better than Babe. I admit it may be corny to those older than 10, but it definitely a good choice for a young one. The actors are a little cheesy, but the talking animals are too cute. The plot is interesting as the main character, Gordy, is trying to save his family, so of course the story is good for little ones to learn family values.

    I remembered borrowing this film from my Auntie when I was roughly 9 or 10 years old and I remember that I both enjoyed it and disliked it. The many flaws of this movie was the farm had no farmer and the pig was looking for his father when he said that he was looking for his mother. I don't mind films about animals talking to humans, but this film is all about how a pig gets famous in society and the government gives money towards him (Hankey ("HOWDY HO!") is too young so he has to give the fortune to the f*****g piglet who is much younger than him!) which makes the film sound more grown up, but the pig talks to the humans in such a horrible (not as in rude, but in a terrible) manner, he makes snorting noises when he is talking at the exactly same time. Nice try Gordy, but you will never be any better than Babe! If you are a fully grown adult without any kids, then don't watch it without any children. Watch Babe instead if you want to see a decent pig movie! My overall rating for Gordy: 1 and a half out of 5!

    When I sat down to watch this Disney movie, I expected to be at least somewhat entertained and remember my childhood. I forgot that I had watched Babe and ended up spending 19.99 for some movie about a pig that tries to save his family for the first 5 minutes and then becomes a CEO of a large corporation on Wall Street. I am not lying people a pig becomes a CEO of a company, a legitimate company! There is this one character who's name I fortunately forgot who sings some hick song and is dressed like Hannah Montana next to Billy Ray Cyrus. The only thing that was enjoyable was a retarded rap song called "Pig Power in the House" by Tag Team. Don't see this movie if you are near sharp objects for reasons I would not disclose. If it were up to me "Gordy" would be bacon right now.

    I'll keep this seemingly inevitable comparison brief. Whereas Babe is a sweet, enchanting gem of a family film, Gordy for me isn't in the same league, in fact it is on the opposite end of the spectrum. Other than the bright and breezy country and western soundtrack and the fact that Gordy is somewhat adorable, this is rather charmless family fare. Gordy does look rather cheap, not in the scenery, the scenery is nice, but the flat and rushed camera-work does not do it justice. The story is very predictable and never seems to find a direction, the direction is sloppy, the script is tedious and unfunny and a vast majority of the jokes are corny. Add some horrible acting and every barnyard clich&eacute; in the book, do we really need the evil boyfriend idea again, and we have a film of low-quality and very little charm, also even for quite a short movie it drags badly. Kids might like it, but to be honest adults might find it an insult to their intelligence. 2/10 Bethany Cox

    If you're looking for a very well done, deep movie, I would recommend you to look elsewhere. I became curious about the movie when my family and I were headed to our vacation to Charleston, SC. This was just shortly before it came out in theaters; the pig playing Gordy was visiting North Carolina (Statesville, I believe) where we stayed overnight. I wanted to see him but the travelling schedule didn't allow it. I was given Gordy on VHS for Christmas '95 and I've only watched it one other time since. The acting isn't anything to write for nor are the effects for the pig's talking. I have to say though, I thought it was neat seeing a pig swim.

    I sat down with my just turned 5 year old for "Family Movie Night" and we let him pick this off the free video on demand. Sure the kid loved it, but words cannot describe how awful this movie is. I would rather saw off my head with an electric toothbrush (modified of course) than to watch this movie again. There are so many parts of this movie that are just completely unbelievable, it makes you want to cry (Ignore the fact that the pig talks and humans can understand him....that's the most believable thing in the movie). During one scene, the kid and pig are walking down the road lost when all of the sudden the only people in the entire country that know them pass by them in their RV. Granted this is just some country road and the people in the RV are traveling all over the country singing. Another scene has the bad guys throwing a pig off a couple hundred feet bridge where Cousin Idiot is able to catch the pig in his arms down below without the other people noticing. The wealthy businessman dies and leaves his company to his young grandson. However, because his grandson is too young to run the company, he gives complete control to Gordy. Gordy is a f'ing pig mind you. The pig is then shown interviewed numerous times on stock market / business type shows where the host asks him a question and the pig snorts a few times in response. The entire plot seems like it was generated by some drawing board created by a 3 year old. I cannot imagine how this actually got funding to produce or how badly an actor needed a job to look at this script and say "Hell yes, sign me up."

    Miss Kitty's, a bar/dance hall that was featured in the movie, "GORDY" was located on Franklin Road in Marietta, GA. It was once a country dance hall known to many locals which went out of business shortly after The Crystal Chandelier opened in Kennesaw, GA...near Marietta. It is now known as "Cowboys" which features many current country artists for their weekend concerts. This was one of the few country bars (believe it or not) that existed in Metro Atlanta. What you see in the movie was what you got! It did look bigger in the movie that I remembered. However, the last time I visited Miss Kitty's was in 1991...21st birthday. Miss Kitty's...RIP. Good fun.

    Gordy is a truly terrible and pathetic movie, and what's unique is that it was released right before Babe. You'd think that would've caused people to confuse the two; yet Babe went on to be a huge hit and get a Best Picture nomination. That really does speak volumes about the quality of Babe. Gordy is just terrible on every level, with a story that is badly put together. Gordy's a talking pig looking for his family. He first gets discovered by a little country girl who sings about "checking on your butt" (yes, it's true). One day they're at some event for a rich family. The rich little boy can't swim, but instead of being scared of the water, as would be normal, he goes right up to the pool and sits on the diving board! And then, as he's getting up, he's actually surprised that he falls in. Turns out the country girl can't swim either. But wouldn't ya know it, the pig can! So Gordy rescues the little rich boy, and now becomes the world's richest pig. Gordy explains that all animals can really talk, but only simple folks can understand them. This includes innocent children and idiot adults, which becomes an ongoing gag (Cousin Jake is a moron and when the pig talks to him, he can understand! Ho ho!) Eventually Bill Clinton calls (the voice of a bad Clinton imitator) and he can understand Gordy also. Ho ho! (I wonder if they'd have done this same gag if Bush had been president at the time, or would it have been too obvious a joke?). Although this is a silly premise, at least it's something to go on, but the movie doesn't know how to create a plot from it, so it goes in various directions. We have clich&eacute;s like the evil boyfriend who wants to marry the rich boy's mother for her money. We have a plot line where Gordy and the rich boy run away, shaking off the evil boyfriend's goons, but it only lasts 20 minutes. Even this can't be stretched out to 90 minutes, so we have pointless scenes that're dragged out for no real reason, such as the entire "butt-check" song, and a depressing sequence where Gordy's family is put in some cruel cock-fight competition. Gordy's conversations with the rich boy feel very stilted. Of course this is because the kid, not a great actor to begin with, was just talking to a pig on set all day, and the voice for Gordy added later does not seem to actually be talking off of him. The fact that the pig doesn't look like its actually talking does not help. So Gordy is...bad. Compared to Babe, which was delightful and had a serious story, Gordy is excrement which fails as entertainment.

Now he's off on an epic search in the city to find his folks! Along the way, he makes friends with two kids, and saves one of them from drowning! Gordy becomes famous for his actions of heroism, and becomes the CEO of a business! Eventually, with all the fame Gordy has attracted, he gets his own stamp! Meanwhile, an unscrupulous business man tries to take on Gordy and get rid of him! His henchman are told to kidnap him, tie him in a sack, and toss him in the river! But with the help of his new friends, they all figure out where his family's been taken to (a slaughterhouse in Omaha). They go there and successfully shut the sinister slaughterhouse down once and for all! And in the end, Gordy and his friends and family all get to live together on the farm forever! This seems to be a love-it or hate-it type movie. But I loved it! A sweet story, cute characters, and a precious piglet! This is one of the most underrated movies ever! It's beautiful and proves that no matter how small you may be, you can always make a difference! And it's NOT a rip-off of Babe. They are just as good and just happen to share some similarities.

    After reading such negative reviews on here, I just had to step in and write a review! Gordy came out when I was 6, so it was prime time for me. Gordy became one of my favorite movies, along with "The Road To El Dorado" and "The Lion King" and many more. Granted "Babe" was a big hit and a family favorite for many, I would say Gordy is just as good, if not better than Babe. I admit it may be corny to those older than 10, but it definitely a good choice for a young one. The actors are a little cheesy, but the talking animals are too cute. The plot is interesting as the main character, Gordy, is trying to save his family, so of course the story is good for little ones to learn family values.

    I remembered borrowing this film from my Auntie when I was roughly 9 or 10 years old and I remember that I both enjoyed it and disliked it. The many flaws of this movie was the farm had no farmer and the pig was looking for his father when he said that he was looking for his mother. I don't mind films about animals talking to humans, but this film is all about how a pig gets famous in society and the government gives money towards him (Hankey ("HOWDY HO!") is too young so he has to give the fortune to the f*****g piglet who is much younger than him!) which makes the film sound more grown up, but the pig talks to the humans in such a horrible (not as in rude, but in a terrible) manner, he makes snorting noises when he is talking at the exactly same time. Nice try Gordy, but you will never be any better than Babe! If you are a fully grown adult without any kids, then don't watch it without any children. Watch Babe instead if you want to see a decent pig movie! My overall rating for Gordy: 1 and a half out of 5!

    When I sat down to watch this Disney movie, I expected to be at least somewhat entertained and remember my childhood. I forgot that I had watched Babe and ended up spending 19.99 for some movie about a pig that tries to save his family for the first 5 minutes and then becomes a CEO of a large corporation on Wall Street. I am not lying people a pig becomes a CEO of a company, a legitimate company! There is this one character who's name I fortunately forgot who sings some hick song and is dressed like Hannah Montana next to Billy Ray Cyrus. The only thing that was enjoyable was a retarded rap song called "Pig Power in the House" by Tag Team. Don't see this movie if you are near sharp objects for reasons I would not disclose. If it were up to me "Gordy" would be bacon right now.

    I'll keep this seemingly inevitable comparison brief. Whereas Babe is a sweet, enchanting gem of a family film, Gordy for me isn't in the same league, in fact it is on the opposite end of the spectrum. Other than the bright and breezy country and western soundtrack and the fact that Gordy is somewhat adorable, this is rather charmless family fare. Gordy does look rather cheap, not in the scenery, the scenery is nice, but the flat and rushed camera-work does not do it justice. The story is very predictable and never seems to find a direction, the direction is sloppy, the script is tedious and unfunny and a vast majority of the jokes are corny. Add some horrible acting and every barnyard clich&eacute; in the book, do we really need the evil boyfriend idea again, and we have a film of low-quality and very little charm, also even for quite a short movie it drags badly. Kids might like it, but to be honest adults might find it an insult to their intelligence. 2/10 Bethany Cox

    If you're looking for a very well done, deep movie, I would recommend you to look elsewhere. I became curious about the movie when my family and I were headed to our vacation to Charleston, SC. This was just shortly before it came out in theaters; the pig playing Gordy was visiting North Carolina (Statesville, I believe) where we stayed overnight. I wanted to see him but the travelling schedule didn't allow it. I was given Gordy on VHS for Christmas '95 and I've only watched it one other time since. The acting isn't anything to write for nor are the effects for the pig's talking. I have to say though, I thought it was neat seeing a pig swim.

    I sat down with my just turned 5 year old for "Family Movie Night" and we let him pick this off the free video on demand. Sure the kid loved it, but words cannot describe how awful this movie is. I would rather saw off my head with an electric toothbrush (modified of course) than to watch this movie again. There are so many parts of this movie that are just completely unbelievable, it makes you want to cry (Ignore the fact that the pig talks and humans can understand him....that's the most believable thing in the movie). During one scene, the kid and pig are walking down the road lost when all of the sudden the only people in the entire country that know them pass by them in their RV. Granted this is just some country road and the people in the RV are traveling all over the country singing. Another scene has the bad guys throwing a pig off a couple hundred feet bridge where Cousin Idiot is able to catch the pig in his arms down below without the other people noticing. The wealthy businessman dies and leaves his company to his young grandson. However, because his grandson is too young to run the company, he gives complete control to Gordy. Gordy is a f'ing pig mind you. The pig is then shown interviewed numerous times on stock market / business type shows where the host asks him a question and the pig snorts a few times in response. The entire plot seems like it was generated by some drawing board created by a 3 year old. I cannot imagine how this actually got funding to produce or how badly an actor needed a job to look at this script and say "Hell yes, sign me up."

    Miss Kitty's, a bar/dance hall that was featured in the movie, "GORDY" was located on Franklin Road in Marietta, GA. It was once a country dance hall known to many locals which went out of business shortly after The Crystal Chandelier opened in Kennesaw, GA...near Marietta. It is now known as "Cowboys" which features many current country artists for their weekend concerts. This was one of the few country bars (believe it or not) that existed in Metro Atlanta. What you see in the movie was what you got! It did look bigger in the movie that I remembered. However, the last time I visited Miss Kitty's was in 1991...21st birthday. Miss Kitty's...RIP. Good fun.

    A Terrible and Pathetic Movie

    Gordy is a truly terrible and pathetic movie, and what's unique is that it was released right before Babe. You'd think that would've caused people to confuse the two; yet Babe went on to be a huge hit and get a Best Picture nomination. That really does speak volumes about the quality of Babe. Gordy is just terrible on every level, with a story that is badly put together. Gordy's a talking pig looking for his family. He first gets discovered by a little country girl who sings about "checking on your butt" (yes, it's true). One day they're at some event for a rich family. The rich little boy can't swim, but instead of being scared of the water, as would be normal, he goes right up to the pool and sits on the diving board! And then, as he's getting up, he's actually surprised that he falls in. Turns out the country girl can't swim either. But wouldn't ya know it, the pig can! So Gordy rescues the little rich boy, and now becomes the world's richest pig. Gordy explains that all animals can really talk, but only simple folks can understand them. This includes innocent children and idiot adults, which becomes an ongoing gag (Cousin Jake is a moron and when the pig talks to him, he can understand! Ho ho!) Eventually Bill Clinton calls (the voice of a bad Clinton imitator) and he can understand Gordy also. Ho ho! (I wonder if they'd have done this same gag if Bush had been president at the time, or would it have been too obvious a joke?). Although this is a silly premise, at least it's something to go on, but the movie doesn't know how to create a plot from it, so it goes in various directions. We have clich&eacute;s like the evil boyfriend who wants to marry the rich boy's mother for her money. We have a plot line where Gordy and the rich boy run away, shaking off the evil boyfriend's goons, but it only lasts 20 minutes. Even this can't be stretched out to 90 minutes, so we have pointless scenes that're dragged out for no real reason, such as the entire "butt-check" song, and a depressing sequence where Gordy's family is put in some cruel cock-fight competition. Gordy's conversations with the rich boy feel very stilted. Of course this is because the kid, not a great actor to begin with, was just talking to a pig on set all day, and the voice for Gordy added later does not seem to actually be talking off of him. The fact that the pig doesn't look like its actually talking does not help. So Gordy is...bad. Compared to Babe, which was delightful and had a serious story, Gordy is excrement which fails as entertainment.
