    Hired to protect a widow, a private detective learns of her husband's work in the supernatural when his instructor, the leader of a black-magic cult awakens and seeks his vengeance upon them for their past work against him. This turned out to be a massive disappointment due to the fact that there's just not a whole lot here to like. One of the few good elements is the traditional use of an obscure atmosphere and occult imaginings that are just really creepy and chilling as they tamper with themes they have no business doing so with. As well, the search for the leader's writings and hiding place make for some pretty interesting times and the finale in the decrepit halls of his sanctuary and the full use of the black magic is a lot of fun. The main problem here with the film is the fact that it's just far too long and really takes far too much to get going as there's just so many useless scenes that add unnecessary time to the proceedings that there's no real use in featuring them, which include the scenes of them in the magic club, the following home from the funeral and the numerous failed attempts on his life that make the cult seem wholly incompetent to risk that kind of exposure that often with so many failed attempts. As well, the special effects are wholly terrible with primitive CGI that looks laughable and totally unconvincing, a villain with a changing conquest plan that makes no sense and a really thin story that's never fleshed out. These here drag it down quite a bit. Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and Brief Nudity.

    Scott Bakula plays tough New York private eye Harry D'Amour who is hired to catch an insurance fraudster in L.A. and becomes entangled in a dangerous web of murder, mystery, and magic, both real and illusion. Clive Barker is best known among movie fans for the Hellraiser series, adaptations of his other books receiving far less attention than those featuring Pinhead and his pals. It's a shame, because those who haven't yet delved into the other dark recesses of the author's twisted mind are doing themselves a great disservice, missing out on some really freaky fare. Lord of lllusions, for example, rarely seems to get a mention, and yet it offers enough exquisitely strange and thoroughly warped delights to keep even the most picky of Hellraiser fans happy. Barker once again proves that he just as good at realising fantastical horror on film as on paper, displaying visual acuity, an impressive knack for atmosphere, and an uncanny ability to depict the stuff of nightmares.

    Acclaimed author Clive Barker adapts his own story "The Last Illusion" for this not especially imaginative but still well realized terror tale. It does do a neat job of combining detective fiction with a more paranormal / mystical bent. Scott Bakula plays private detective Harry D'Amour, who travels from NYC to LA on a routine case, ends up caught in something far more sinister. Story threads include the apparent death of a performing illusionist, Philip Swann (Kevin J. O'Connor) and the resurrection of a diabolical cult leader, Nix (Daniel von Bargen). Harry meets assorted dubious types on his way to figuring out just what the Hell is going on, falling in love with the illusionists' wife Dorothea (Famke Janssen) as well. Nothing that happens here is terribly surprising, but Barker does make up for that with a consistently gloomy tone, overwhelming atmosphere, and effective visuals, and also by getting convincing performances out of his well chosen cast. Bakula is a likable enough lead, Famke looks fetching as always, von Bargen is a genuinely intimidating villain (it's easy enough to believe that his character is no phony, but the real thing); other vivid contributions are made by character players Joseph Latimore, Sheila Tousey, Susan Traylor, Wayne Grace, Barry Del Sherman, Joel Swetow, Vincent Schiavelli, and Barry Shabaka Henley. The movie has impressive gore & makeup effects, and in general does show off the same kind of theatricality as a good stage show, being careful to make the distinction between "magic" and "illusions". As it begins, Barker is already layering on the tension and giving us a sense of doom and gloom to come. This is a good, meaty enough story that, even in its 122 minute long unrated director's cut, avoids any sort of filler and delivers enough twists and turns to keep it interesting. It's only too bad that Barker isn't inspired to direct his own stories more often, as the movies he turns out are a cut above most of what we see in the horror genre. "Lord of Illusions" is long but never boring. Seven out of 10.

    This films starts out with a group of people infiltrating a cult leaders place and placing a mask on said cult leader. Very painful process and you may wonder why they felt the need to do this, it is because this man has powers and they are very deadly. Flash years later and the man who was pretty much in charge of stopping the cult leader and was once under his tutelage is now an illusionist. Well one of his tricks goes array and his wife knows that something is not quite right so she hires an investigator to find out what is going on. Enter Harry D'mour, an investigator played by Scott Bakula who I always have to wonder how did this guy not get more roles in more mainstream fare as he is a rather good actor. Well the cult leaders former cult is trying to revive him and this is something that must be stopped, because this guy is like evil. You will get to find out how evil during a scene where he gives the gift of rain to his followers that is really quite freaky. Had some good qualities in this one, but so much more could of been done. The kills though are good, the story is pretty good too, I just find the ending a bit underdone, I was expecting more. However, all in all a rather good offering from writer Clive Barker.

    This was a pretty decent film. The story line was good but went way over the top by the end and it almost ruined the whole thing. The cast is class A. Scott Bakula is great and funny in the film. Kevin J. O'Connor is good and comes off kind of creepy. Famke Janssen is a good female lead. Daniel Von Bargen is really crazy in this film and was a good evil lead. There are many good side characters as well, but my favorite is played by Barry Del as Sherman. Talk about one messed up creepy character. The film has some decent special effects for its time and it may not make you jump out of your seat, but you will still mentally feel scared. It really does have that creepy feeling. Clive Barker really did a decent job on this film.

    What the &@#% is this @$&%!?!? First off, I have always loved Clive Barker films more perhaps than any other author in the genre because the books are primarily kept in line with the stories and maintain a strong visual representation to his original vision. Hellraiser, Nightbreed, Dread, and Books of Blood all while suffering changes, maintained the vision. This movie... this movie does not in any shape of the imagination. The first problem I have is with the way characters are portrayed. Butterfield is transformed form a high powered attorney to a homosexual sadomasochist looking thing, Swann is portrayed as this young 90s hipster looking thing rather than a man that that woman he's seducing at the beginning of the novella comments that she prefers men 20 years younger than, Dorotheia is a child who was saved from cult activities rather than a prostitute, and there are just so many things wrong with Valentine (like the lack of him being a demon) that I don't want to start. Then we have the problem with the movie itself. The idea of "cremate Swann before the Gulfs can tear his soul apart" story of the novella was very good and very compelling. It was a fascinating read that I didn't want to let go of until it done. This travesty with Nix, and cults, and scenes taken from "Sins of the Father" was a jumbled mess that stomped all over the plot points which made the original story so good. My belief? Read the novella and watch this merely as a companion piece. Because quite honestly it comes down to this: Stephen King had the ABC miniseries It that debased the work it came from... well Clive Barker has this movie to his credit.

    I voted 10 on this simply because it deserves it.... every aspect of this movie was done so well, you would not question any of it to begin with. Clive Barker has a unique style in how he portrays and paints his characters, and the ones here shine brightly. As usual, there is plenty of blood, and sinister happenings in the world of magic, where psychos with god like powers are raging mad, getting killed, resurrecting from the dead, faking deaths... do not want to spoil it for you. Scott Bakula deliver in my opinion the role of his career as the NY detective D'amour with a connection to the spirit world, whether good or evil. the same can be said for Daniel von Bargen, that guy that always seems to be a cop or s.w.a.t. team member in every movie you see. Well in this one, he's the ultimate personification of evil. like with the original Hellraiser, Barker paints all of the emotions and dark feelings of the human mind and heart very well once again with Lord of Illusions.

    Horror movies that audiences connect with are usually about some familiar threat, like vampires, werewolves, zombies, monsters, killer animals, or just serial killers with or without masks on. Clive Barker's work has more in common with H.P. Lovecraft, in that it attempts to describe mythologies and threats that are either obscure or totally unknown to the viewer. The risk is always that the audience might not "get it". It's hard to be scared about something unless you know what it is. It's even harder to stay interested in a movie unless you have a good idea of what's going on. "Lord of Illusions" leaves the viewer in the dark for so long that it becomes tedious, giving us bizarre manifestations that don't really mean anything until the movie's almost over. By that point, it's too late. I found it reminiscent of "Hellraiser", darkly fascinating but ultimately ridiculous in the way it inserts bizarre characters doing bizarre things with motivations that we don't understand. I did like the way he made it reminiscent of film noir. His special effects are ambitious, even if they usually look silly. His gruesome trademark of violating human bodies in hideous ways is represented here, so if you're into that, you definitely won't be disappointed.

    A far cry away from the classic The Warlock. Decent horror flick with some under-written script issues. Generally fine with some eerie moments, but the plot is all around the place with no real focus on the who, what and where. Nonetheless a blast from the past from the 90s is a welcome breather for the gorno crapfest we are dished out nowadays. Nix (Daniel von Bargen) is the leader of a cult. Due to dark dealings he has amassed incredible power, which he hopes to share with Philip Swann (Kevin J. O'Connor). Disgusted with the evil and destruction that Nix represents Swann with a group of friends decide to end his terrible reign and save the young Dorothea. They manage to capture the magician and bury him deep underground. 13 years later Philip Swann is a world renowned illusionist and is married to the grown up Dorothea (Famke Jannsen). The cult following of Nix has never revoked their beliefs and are still intent on freeing their master. Dorothea hires a PI with a knack for the occult, Harry D'Amour (Scott Bakula) to look after her husband. Swann however mysteriously dies during his latest illusion... There is a lot to like about this movie together with its retro feel from the great days of the 80s/90s horrors. Plus Clive Barker always supplies eerie occult atmosphere even if he is a bit iffy on the plot side of things. A couple of great and relatively scary scenes make this a worthwhile watch, even if the lack of direction to the story is frustrating. The Scott Bakula character feels superfluous and unnecessary, albeit Bakula does a good acting job and is a standout character. Nonetheless the movie seems to introduce characters and situations just so that we get gore and occult magic here and there, but there really is no purpose to the plot. Could be better, but still a decent 5.

    Way back in the when, Lord of Illusions was the last film that my parents ever made me turn off when I started watching it on television. They were unamused by a scene with a tied up young girl and a mandrill, and so I ended up not seeing the film until some years later. I've seen it a few times now, and though perhaps the least of Clive Barkers great forays into direction, lacking the immense gruesome brilliance of Hellraiser or the thrilling monster laden madness of Nightbreed, it is more coherent than Nightbreed and acres ahead of most horror fare of the mid 90's. The plot sees a private investigator, Harry D'Amour becoming embroiled in the dangerous world of magic, through dealing with a great illusionist named Swann with a dark past involving an evildoer named Nix. The opening to this film is superb, a flashback to a cult compound led by the malign Nix, with an incredibly chilling atmosphere and some disturbing moments. As the film moves to the modern day and centers around D'Amour things slow down and go more into a sort of fantasy noir territory, though not without splashes of grue and a good deal of foreboding, as things heat up again in building to coming excitement. Acting wise Kevin J. O'Connor is great as Swann, twitchy, nervous and pretty weird, wholly convincing as a man of great powers but beset by fears. As his beautiful wife, Famke Jansenn is a tad underused but is good on the eye and carries her role nicely. Scott Bakula is vaguely bland as D'Amour, but I thought this relatively weak pairing worked well as a counterpoint to the spiralling madness around them. Most interesting are Barry del Sherman as gay hit-man Butterfield, with a kinky, sinister edge and a performance of ferocious physicality, especially in a couple of fights and Daniel von Bargen as Nix, playing the role with a booming malevolence that is less scary horror villain and more fantastical demon. The film is generally well written, with some great lines, especially for the bad characters and von Bargen gives all of his evil dialogue maximum power. As well as the dialogue working nicely, there is also a lot of thematic interest, with some gay themes relating to Butterfield and his partner, the relationship between Swann and Nix and also tied into the whole business of magic and its practitioners or those involved with it in the film. The film takes a freaky look at cult obsession and magic too. The only real problems I had with this film relate to some of the special effects work and the ending. There are some instances where animation effects are used that really date the film and don't look terribly good. Normally I wouldn't criticise effects in a film but better ones were used in Hellraiser and Nightbreed and in the case of Hellraiser some were of a similar type to ones in Lord of Illusions but done much better. Also, the finale is a tad unsatisfying in some respects, definitely less grisly than it should have been and a bit cheesy. Its fun, but definitely doesn't match the opening or some other moments in the film. More nastiness splashed over the course of the film might have been nice too, but things stay interesting anyway so I can't complain to much. Altogether, this is a rich, potent and sometimes pretty scary horror film, Barker does a fine job directing for the most part, handling tension and nastiness with great skill and maintaining a sinister bubbling brew of potent horror throughout. He has done better, but I still recommend this highly indeed, one of the best horror films of the 90's.

    Horror movies that audiences connect with are usually about some familiar threat, like vampires, werewolves, zombies, monsters, killer animals, or just serial killers with or without masks on. Clive Barker's work has more in common with H.P. Lovecraft, in that it attempts to describe mythologies and threats that are either obscure or totally unknown to the viewer. The risk is always that the audience might not "get it". It's hard to be scared about something unless you know what it is. It's even harder to stay interested in a movie unless you have a good idea of what's going on. "Lord of Illusions" leaves the viewer in the dark for so long that it becomes tedious, giving us bizarre manifestations that don't really mean anything until the movie's almost over. By that point, it's too late. I found it reminiscent of "Hellraiser", darkly fascinating but ultimately ridiculous in the way it inserts bizarre characters doing bizarre things with motivations that we don't understand. I did like the way he made it reminiscent of film noir. His special effects are ambitious, even if they usually look silly. His gruesome trademark of violating human bodies in hideous ways is represented here, so if you're into that, you definitely won't be disappointed.

    A far cry away from the classic The Warlock. Decent horror flick with some under-written script issues. Generally fine with some eerie moments, but the plot is all around the place with no real focus on the who, what and where. Nonetheless a blast from the past from the 90s is a welcome breather for the gorno crapfest we are dished out nowadays. Nix (Daniel von Bargen) is the leader of a cult. Due to dark dealings he has amassed incredible power, which he hopes to share with Philip Swann (Kevin J. O'Connor). Disgusted with the evil and destruction that Nix represents Swann with a group of friends decide to end his terrible reign and save the young Dorothea. They manage to capture the magician and bury him deep underground. 13 years later Philip Swann is a world renowned illusionist and is married to the grown up Dorothea (Famke Jannsen). The cult following of Nix has never revoked their beliefs and are still intent on freeing their master. Dorothea hires a PI with a knack for the occult, Harry D'Amour (Scott Bakula) to look after her husband. Swann however mysteriously dies during his latest illusion... There is a lot to like about this movie together with its retro feel from the great days of the 80s/90s horrors. Plus Clive Barker always supplies eerie occult atmosphere even if he is a bit iffy on the plot side of things. A couple of great and relatively scary scenes make this a worthwhile watch, even if the lack of direction to the story is frustrating. The Scott Bakula character feels superfluous and unnecessary, albeit Bakula does a good acting job and is a standout character. Nonetheless the movie seems to introduce characters and situations just so that we get gore and occult magic here and there, but there really is no purpose to the plot. Could be better, but still a decent 5.

    Way back in the when, Lord of Illusions was the last film that my parents ever made me turn off when I started watching it on television. They were unamused by a scene with a tied up young girl and a mandrill, and so I ended up not seeing the film until some years later. I've seen it a few times now, and though perhaps the least of Clive Barkers great forays into direction, lacking the immense gruesome brilliance of Hellraiser or the thrilling monster laden madness of Nightbreed, it is more coherent than Nightbreed and acres ahead of most horror fare of the mid 90's. The plot sees a private investigator, Harry D'Amour becoming embroiled in the dangerous world of magic, through dealing with a great illusionist named Swann with a dark past involving an evildoer named Nix. The opening to this film is superb, a flashback to a cult compound led by the malign Nix, with an incredibly chilling atmosphere and some disturbing moments. As the film moves to the modern day and centers around D'Amour things slow down and go more into a sort of fantasy noir territory, though not without splashes of grue and a good deal of foreboding, as things heat up again in building to coming excitement. Acting wise Kevin J. O'Connor is great as Swann, twitchy, nervous and pretty weird, wholly convincing as a man of great powers but beset by fears. As his beautiful wife, Famke Jansenn is a tad underused but is good on the eye and carries her role nicely. Scott Bakula is vaguely bland as D'Amour, but I thought this relatively weak pairing worked well as a counterpoint to the spiralling madness around them. Most interesting are Barry del Sherman as gay hit-man Butterfield, with a kinky, sinister edge and a performance of ferocious physicality, especially in a couple of fights and Daniel von Bargen as Nix, playing the role with a booming malevolence that is less scary horror villain and more fantastical demon. The film is generally well written, with some great lines, especially for the bad characters and von Bargen gives all of his evil dialogue maximum power. As well as the dialogue working nicely, there is also a lot of thematic interest, with some gay themes relating to Butterfield and his partner, the relationship between Swann and Nix and also tied into the whole business of magic and its practitioners or those involved with it in the film. The film takes a freaky look at cult obsession and magic too. The only real problems I had with this film relate to some of the special effects work and the ending. There are some instances where animation effects are used that really date the film and don't look terribly good. Normally I wouldn't criticise effects in a film but better ones were used in Hellraiser and Nightbreed and in the case of Hellraiser some were of a similar type to ones in Lord of Illusions but done much better. Also, the finale is a tad unsatisfying in some respects, definitely less grisly than it should have been and a bit cheesy. Its fun, but definitely doesn't match the opening or some other moments in the film. More nastiness splashed over the course of the film might have been nice too, but things stay interesting anyway so I can't complain to much. Altogether, this is a rich, potent and sometimes pretty scary horror film, Barker does a fine job directing for the most part, handling tension and nastiness with great skill and maintaining a sinister bubbling brew of potent horror throughout. He has done better, but I still recommend this highly indeed, one of the best horror films of the 90's.

    Hired to protect a widow, a private detective learns of her husband's work in the supernatural when his instructor, the leader of a black-magic cult awakens and seeks his vengeance upon them for their past work against him. This turned out to be a massive disappointment due to the fact that there's just not a whole lot here to like. One of the few good elements is the traditional use of an obscure atmosphere and occult imaginings that are just really creepy and chilling as they tamper with themes they have no business doing so with. As well, the search for the leader's writings and hiding place make for some pretty interesting times and the finale in the decrepit halls of his sanctuary and the full use of the black magic is a lot of fun. The main problem here with the film is the fact that it's just far too long and really takes far too much to get going as there's just so many useless scenes that add unnecessary time to the proceedings that there's no real use in featuring them, which include the scenes of them in the magic club, the following home from the funeral and the numerous failed attempts on his life that make the cult seem wholly incompetent to risk that kind of exposure that often with so many failed attempts. As well, the special effects are wholly terrible with primitive CGI that looks laughable and totally unconvincing, a villain with a changing conquest plan that makes no sense and a really thin story that's never fleshed out. These here drag it down quite a bit. Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and Brief Nudity.

    Scott Bakula plays tough New York private eye Harry D'Amour who is hired to catch an insurance fraudster in L.A. and becomes entangled in a dangerous web of murder, mystery, and magic, both real and illusion. Clive Barker is best known among movie fans for the Hellraiser series, adaptations of his other books receiving far less attention than those featuring Pinhead and his pals. It's a shame, because those who haven't yet delved into the other dark recesses of the author's twisted mind are doing themselves a great disservice, missing out on some really freaky fare. Lord of lllusions, for example, rarely seems to get a mention, and yet it offers enough exquisitely strange and thoroughly warped delights to keep even the most picky of Hellraiser fans happy. Barker once again proves that he just as good at realising fantastical horror on film as on paper, displaying visual acuity, an impressive knack for atmosphere, and an uncanny ability to depict the stuff of nightmares.

    Acclaimed author Clive Barker adapts his own story "The Last Illusion" for this not especially imaginative but still well realized terror tale. It does do a neat job of combining detective fiction with a more paranormal / mystical bent. Scott Bakula plays private detective Harry D'Amour, who travels from NYC to LA on a routine case, ends up caught in something far more sinister. Story threads include the apparent death of a performing illusionist, Philip Swann (Kevin J. O'Connor) and the resurrection of a diabolical cult leader, Nix (Daniel von Bargen). Harry meets assorted dubious types on his way to figuring out just what the Hell is going on, falling in love with the illusionists' wife Dorothea (Famke Janssen) as well. Nothing that happens here is terribly surprising, but Barker does make up for that with a consistently gloomy tone, overwhelming atmosphere, and effective visuals, and also by getting convincing performances out of his well chosen cast. Bakula is a likable enough lead, Famke looks fetching as always, von Bargen is a genuinely intimidating villain (it's easy enough to believe that his character is no phony, but the real thing); other vivid contributions are made by character players Joseph Latimore, Sheila Tousey, Susan Traylor, Wayne Grace, Barry Del Sherman, Joel Swetow, Vincent Schiavelli, and Barry Shabaka Henley. The movie has impressive gore & makeup effects, and in general does show off the same kind of theatricality as a good stage show, being careful to make the distinction between "magic" and "illusions". As it begins, Barker is already layering on the tension and giving us a sense of doom and gloom to come. This is a good, meaty enough story that, even in its 122 minute long unrated director's cut, avoids any sort of filler and delivers enough twists and turns to keep it interesting. It's only too bad that Barker isn't inspired to direct his own stories more often, as the movies he turns out are a cut above most of what we see in the horror genre. "Lord of Illusions" is long but never boring. Seven out of 10.

    This films starts out with a group of people infiltrating a cult leaders place and placing a mask on said cult leader. Very painful process and you may wonder why they felt the need to do this, it is because this man has powers and they are very deadly. Flash years later and the man who was pretty much in charge of stopping the cult leader and was once under his tutelage is now an illusionist. Well one of his tricks goes array and his wife knows that something is not quite right so she hires an investigator to find out what is going on. Enter Harry D'mour, an investigator played by Scott Bakula who I always have to wonder how did this guy not get more roles in more mainstream fare as he is a rather good actor. Well the cult leaders former cult is trying to revive him and this is something that must be stopped, because this guy is like evil. You will get to find out how evil during a scene where he gives the gift of rain to his followers that is really quite freaky. Had some good qualities in this one, but so much more could of been done. The kills though are good, the story is pretty good too, I just find the ending a bit underdone, I was expecting more. However, all in all a rather good offering from writer Clive Barker.

    This was a pretty decent film. The story line was good but went way over the top by the end and it almost ruined the whole thing. The cast is class A. Scott Bakula is great and funny in the film. Kevin J. O'Connor is good and comes off kind of creepy. Famke Janssen is a good female lead. Daniel Von Bargen is really crazy in this film and was a good evil lead. There are many good side characters as well, but my favorite is played by Barry Del as Sherman. Talk about one messed up creepy character. The film has some decent special effects for its time and it may not make you jump out of your seat, but you will still mentally feel scared. It really does have that creepy feeling. Clive Barker really did a decent job on this film.

    What the &@#% is this @$&%!?!? First off, I have always loved Clive Barker films more perhaps than any other author in the genre because the books are primarily kept in line with the stories and maintain a strong visual representation to his original vision. Hellraiser, Nightbreed, Dread, and Books of Blood all while suffering changes, maintained the vision. This movie... this movie does not in any shape of the imagination. The first problem I have is with the way characters are portrayed. Butterfield is transformed form a high powered attorney to a homosexual sadomasochist looking thing, Swann is portrayed as this young 90s hipster looking thing rather than a man that that woman he's seducing at the beginning of the novella comments that she prefers men 20 years younger than, Dorotheia is a child who was saved from cult activities rather than a prostitute, and there are just so many things wrong with Valentine (like the lack of him being a demon) that I don't want to start. Then we have the problem with the movie itself. The idea of "cremate Swann before the Gulfs can tear his soul apart" story of the novella was very good and very compelling. It was a fascinating read that I didn't want to let go of until it done. This travesty with Nix, and cults, and scenes taken from "Sins of the Father" was a jumbled mess that stomped all over the plot points which made the original story so good. My belief? Read the novella and watch this merely as a companion piece. Because quite honestly it comes down to this: Stephen King had the ABC miniseries It that debased the work it came from... well Clive Barker has this movie to his credit.

    I voted 10 on this simply because it deserves it.... every aspect of this movie was done so well, you would not question any of it to begin with. Clive Barker has a unique style in how he portrays and paints his characters, and the ones here shine brightly. As usual, there is plenty of blood, and sinister happenings in the world of magic, where psychos with god like powers are raging mad, getting killed, resurrecting from the dead, faking deaths... do not want to spoil it for you. Scott Bakula deliver in my opinion the role of his career as the NY detective D'amour with a connection to the spirit world, whether good or evil. the same can be said for Daniel von Bargen, that guy that always seems to be a cop or s.w.a.t. team member in every movie you see. Well in this one, he's the ultimate personification of evil. like with the original Hellraiser, Barker paints all of the emotions and dark feelings of the human mind and heart very well once again with Lord of Illusions.

    This was a pretty decent film. The story line was good but went way over the top by the end and it almost ruined the whole thing. The cast is class A. Scott Bakula is great and funny in the film. Kevin J. O'Connor is good and comes off kind of creepy. Famke Janssen is a good female lead. Daniel Von Bargen is really crazy in this film and was a good evil lead. There are many good side characters as well, but my favorite is played by Barry Del as Sherman. Talk about one messed up creepy character. The film has some decent special effects for its time and it may not make you jump out of your seat, but you will still mentally feel scared. It really does have that creepy feeling. Clive Barker really did a decent job on this film.

    What the &@#% is this @$&%!?!? First off, I have always loved Clive Barker films more perhaps than any other author in the genre because the books are primarily kept in line with the stories and maintain a strong visual representation to his original vision. Hellraiser, Nightbreed, Dread, and Books of Blood all while suffering changes, maintained the vision. This movie... this movie does not in any shape of the imagination. The first problem I have is with the way characters are portrayed. Butterfield is transformed form a high powered attorney to a homosexual sadomasochist looking thing, Swann is portrayed as this young 90s hipster looking thing rather than a man that that woman he's seducing at the beginning of the novella comments that she prefers men 20 years younger than, Dorotheia is a child who was saved from cult activities rather than a prostitute, and there are just so many things wrong with Valentine (like the lack of him being a demon) that I don't want to start. Then we have the problem with the movie itself. The idea of "cremate Swann before the Gulfs can tear his soul apart" story of the novella was very good and very compelling. It was a fascinating read that I didn't want to let go of until it done. This travesty with Nix, and cults, and scenes taken from "Sins of the Father" was a jumbled mess that stomped all over the plot points which made the original story so good. My belief? Read the novella and watch this merely as a companion piece. Because quite honestly it comes down to this: Stephen King had the ABC miniseries It that debased the work it came from... well Clive Barker has this movie to his credit.

    I voted 10 on this simply because it deserves it.... every aspect of this movie was done so well, you would not question any of it to begin with. Clive Barker has a unique style in how he portrays and paints his characters, and the ones here shine brightly. As usual, there is plenty of blood, and sinister happenings in the world of magic, where psychos with god like powers are raging mad, getting killed, resurrecting from the dead, faking deaths... do not want to spoil it for you. Scott Bakula deliver in my opinion the role of his career as the NY detective D'amour with a connection to the spirit world, whether good or evil. the same can be said for Daniel von Bargen, that guy that always seems to be a cop or s.w.a.t. team member in every movie you see. Well in this one, he's the ultimate personification of evil. like with the original Hellraiser, Barker paints all of the emotions and dark feelings of the human mind and heart very well once again with Lord of Illusions.

    Horror movies that audiences connect with are usually about some familiar threat, like vampires, werewolves, zombies, monsters, killer animals, or just serial killers with or without masks on. Clive Barker's work has more in common with H.P. Lovecraft, in that it attempts to describe mythologies and threats that are either obscure or totally unknown to the viewer. The risk is always that the audience might not "get it". It's hard to be scared about something unless you know what it is. It's even harder to stay interested in a movie unless you have a good idea of what's going on. "Lord of Illusions" leaves the viewer in the dark for so long that it becomes tedious, giving us bizarre manifestations that don't really mean anything until the movie's almost over. By that point, it's too late. I found it reminiscent of "Hellraiser", darkly fascinating but ultimately ridiculous in the way it inserts bizarre characters doing bizarre things with motivations that we don't understand. I did like the way he made it reminiscent of film noir. His special effects are ambitious, even if they usually look silly. His gruesome trademark of violating human bodies in hideous ways is represented here, so if you're into that, you definitely won't be disappointed.

    A far cry away from the classic The Warlock. Decent horror flick with some under-written script issues. Generally fine with some eerie moments, but the plot is all around the place with no real focus on the who, what and where. Nonetheless a blast from the past from the 90s is a welcome breather for the gorno crapfest we are dished out nowadays. Nix (Daniel von Bargen) is the leader of a cult. Due to dark dealings he has amassed incredible power, which he hopes to share with Philip Swann (Kevin J. O'Connor). Disgusted with the evil and destruction that Nix represents Swann with a group of friends decide to end his terrible reign and save the young Dorothea. They manage to capture the magician and bury him deep underground. 13 years later Philip Swann is a world renowned illusionist and is married to the grown up Dorothea (Famke Jannsen). The cult following of Nix has never revoked their beliefs and are still intent on freeing their master. Dorothea hires a PI with a knack for the occult, Harry D'Amour (Scott Bakula) to look after her husband. Swann however mysteriously dies during his latest illusion... There is a lot to like about this movie together with its retro feel from the great days of the 80s/90s horrors. Plus Clive Barker always supplies eerie occult atmosphere even if he is a bit iffy on the plot side of things. A couple of great and relatively scary scenes make this a worthwhile watch, even if the lack of direction to the story is frustrating. The Scott Bakula character feels superfluous and unnecessary, albeit Bakula does a good acting job and is a standout character. Nonetheless the movie seems to introduce characters and situations just so that we get gore and occult magic here and there, but there really is no purpose to the plot. Could be better, but still a decent 5.

    Way back in the when, Lord of Illusions was the last film that my parents ever made me turn off when I started watching it on television. They were unamused by a scene with a tied up young girl and a mandrill, and so I ended up not seeing the film until some years later. I've seen it a few times now, and though perhaps the least of Clive Barkers great forays into direction, lacking the immense gruesome brilliance of Hellraiser or the thrilling monster laden madness of Nightbreed, it is more coherent than Nightbreed and acres ahead of most horror fare of the mid 90's. The plot sees a private investigator, Harry D'Amour becoming embroiled in the dangerous world of magic, through dealing with a great illusionist named Swann with a dark past involving an evildoer named Nix. The opening to this film is superb, a flashback to a cult compound led by the malign Nix, with an incredibly chilling atmosphere and some disturbing moments. As the film moves to the modern day and centers around D'Amour things slow down and go more into a sort of fantasy noir territory, though not without splashes of grue and a good deal of foreboding, as things heat up again in building to coming excitement. Acting wise Kevin J. O'Connor is great as Swann, twitchy, nervous and pretty weird, wholly convincing as a man of great powers but beset by fears. As his beautiful wife, Famke Jansenn is a tad underused but is good on the eye and carries her role nicely. Scott Bakula is vaguely bland as D'Amour, but I thought this relatively weak pairing worked well as a counterpoint to the spiralling madness around them. Most interesting are Barry del Sherman as gay hit-man Butterfield, with a kinky, sinister edge and a performance of ferocious physicality, especially in a couple of fights and Daniel von Bargen as Nix, playing the role with a booming malevolence that is less scary horror villain and more fantastical demon. The film is generally well written, with some great lines, especially for the bad characters and von Bargen gives all of his evil dialogue maximum power. As well as the dialogue working nicely, there is also a lot of thematic interest, with some gay themes relating to Butterfield and his partner, the relationship between Swann and Nix and also tied into the whole business of magic and its practitioners or those involved with it in the film. The film takes a freaky look at cult obsession and magic too. The only real problems I had with this film relate to some of the special effects work and the ending. There are some instances where animation effects are used that really date the film and don't look terribly good. Normally I wouldn't criticise effects in a film but better ones were used in Hellraiser and Nightbreed and in the case of Hellraiser some were of a similar type to ones in Lord of Illusions but done much better. Also, the finale is a tad unsatisfying in some respects, definitely less grisly than it should have been and a bit cheesy. Its fun, but definitely doesn't match the opening or some other moments in the film. More nastiness splashed over the course of the film might have been nice too, but things stay interesting anyway so I can't complain to much. Altogether, this is a rich, potent and sometimes pretty scary horror film, Barker does a fine job directing for the most part, handling tension and nastiness with great skill and maintaining a sinister bubbling brew of potent horror throughout. He has done better, but I still recommend this highly indeed, one of the best horror films of the 90's.

    Hired to protect a widow, a private detective learns of her husband's work in the supernatural when his instructor, the leader of a black-magic cult awakens and seeks his vengeance upon them for their past work against him. This turned out to be a massive disappointment due to the fact that there's just not a whole lot here to like. One of the few good elements is the traditional use of an obscure atmosphere and occult imaginings that are just really creepy and chilling as they tamper with themes they have no business doing so with. As well, the search for the leader's writings and hiding place make for some pretty interesting times and the finale in the decrepit halls of his sanctuary and the full use of the black magic is a lot of fun. The main problem here with the film is the fact that it's just far too long and really takes far too much to get going as there's just so many useless scenes that add unnecessary time to the proceedings that there's no real use in featuring them, which include the scenes of them in the magic club, the following home from the funeral and the numerous failed attempts on his life that make the cult seem wholly incompetent to risk that kind of exposure that often with so many failed attempts. As well, the special effects are wholly terrible with primitive CGI that looks laughable and totally unconvincing, a villain with a changing conquest plan that makes no sense and a really thin story that's never fleshed out. These here drag it down quite a bit. Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and Brief Nudity.

    Scott Bakula plays tough New York private eye Harry D'Amour who is hired to catch an insurance fraudster in L.A. and becomes entangled in a dangerous web of murder, mystery, and magic, both real and illusion. Clive Barker is best known among movie fans for the Hellraiser series, adaptations of his other books receiving far less attention than those featuring Pinhead and his pals. It's a shame, because those who haven't yet delved into the other dark recesses of the author's twisted mind are doing themselves a great disservice, missing out on some really freaky fare. Lord of lllusions, for example, rarely seems to get a mention, and yet it offers enough exquisitely strange and thoroughly warped delights to keep even the most picky of Hellraiser fans happy. Barker once again proves that he just as good at realising fantastical horror on film as on paper, displaying visual acuity, an impressive knack for atmosphere, and an uncanny ability to depict the stuff of nightmares.

    Acclaimed author Clive Barker adapts his own story "The Last Illusion" for this not especially imaginative but still well realized terror tale. It does do a neat job of combining detective fiction with a more paranormal / mystical bent. Scott Bakula plays private detective Harry D'Amour, who travels from NYC to LA on a routine case, ends up caught in something far more sinister. Story threads include the apparent death of a performing illusionist, Philip Swann (Kevin J. O'Connor) and the resurrection of a diabolical cult leader, Nix (Daniel von Bargen). Harry meets assorted dubious types on his way to figuring out just what the Hell is going on, falling in love with the illusionists' wife Dorothea (Famke Janssen) as well. Nothing that happens here is terribly surprising, but Barker does make up for that with a consistently gloomy tone, overwhelming atmosphere, and effective visuals, and also by getting convincing performances out of his well chosen cast. Bakula is a likable enough lead, Famke looks fetching as always, von Bargen is a genuinely intimidating villain (it's easy enough to believe that his character is no phony, but the real thing); other vivid contributions are made by character players Joseph Latimore, Sheila Tousey, Susan Traylor, Wayne Grace, Barry Del Sherman, Joel Swetow, Vincent Schiavelli, and Barry Shabaka Henley. The movie has impressive gore & makeup effects, and in general does show off the same kind of theatricality as a good stage show, being careful to make the distinction between "magic" and "illusions". As it begins, Barker is already layering on the tension and giving us a sense of doom and gloom to come. This is a good, meaty enough story that, even in its 122 minute long unrated director's cut, avoids any sort of filler and delivers enough twists and turns to keep it interesting. It's only too bad that Barker isn't inspired to direct his own stories more often, as the movies he turns out are a cut above most of what we see in the horror genre. "Lord of Illusions" is long but never boring. Seven out of 10.

    This films starts out with a group of people infiltrating a cult leaders place and placing a mask on said cult leader. Very painful process and you may wonder why they felt the need to do this, it is because this man has powers and they are very deadly. Flash years later and the man who was pretty much in charge of stopping the cult leader and was once under his tutelage is now an illusionist. Well one of his tricks goes array and his wife knows that something is not quite right so she hires an investigator to find out what is going on. Enter Harry D'mour, an investigator played by Scott Bakula who I always have to wonder how did this guy not get more roles in more mainstream fare as he is a rather good actor. Well the cult leaders former cult is trying to revive him and this is something that must be stopped, because this guy is like evil. You will get to find out how evil during a scene where he gives the gift of rain to his followers that is really quite freaky. Had some good qualities in this one, but so much more could of been done. The kills though are good, the story is pretty good too, I just find the ending a bit underdone, I was expecting more. However, all in all a rather good offering from writer Clive Barker.

It's a shame, because those who haven't yet delved into the other dark recesses of the author's twisted mind are doing themselves a great disservice, missing out on some really freaky fare. Lord of lllusions, for example, rarely seems to get a mention, and yet it offers enough exquisitely strange and thoroughly warped delights to keep even the most picky of Hellraiser fans happy. Barker once again proves that he just as good at realising fantastical horror on film as on paper, displaying visual acuity, an impressive knack for atmosphere, and an uncanny ability to depict the stuff of nightmares.

    Acclaimed author Clive Barker adapts his own story "The Last Illusion" for this not especially imaginative but still well realized terror tale. It does do a neat job of combining detective fiction with a more paranormal / mystical bent. Scott Bakula plays private detective Harry D'Amour, who travels from NYC to LA on a routine case, ends up caught in something far more sinister. Story threads include the apparent death of a performing illusionist, Philip Swann (Kevin J. O'Connor) and the resurrection of a diabolical cult leader, Nix (Daniel von Bargen). Harry meets assorted dubious types on his way to figuring out just what the Hell is going on, falling in love with the illusionists' wife Dorothea (Famke Janssen) as well. Nothing that happens here is terribly surprising, but Barker does make up for that with a consistently gloomy tone, overwhelming atmosphere, and effective visuals, and also by getting convincing performances out of his well chosen cast. Bakula is a likable enough lead, Famke looks fetching as always, von Bargen is a genuinely intimidating villain (it's easy enough to believe that his character is no phony, but the real thing); other vivid contributions are made by character players Joseph Latimore, Sheila Tousey, Susan Traylor, Wayne Grace, Barry Del Sherman, Joel Swetow, Vincent Schiavelli, and Barry Shabaka Henley. The movie has impressive gore & makeup effects, and in general does show off the same kind of theatricality as a good stage show, being careful to make the distinction between "magic" and "illusions". As it begins, Barker is already layering on the tension and giving us a sense of doom and gloom to come. This is a good, meaty enough story that, even in its 122 minute long unrated director's cut, avoids any sort of filler and delivers enough twists and turns to keep it interesting. It's only too bad that Barker isn't inspired to direct his own stories more often, as the movies he turns out are a cut above most of what we see in the horror genre. "Lord of Illusions" is long but never boring. Seven out of 10.

    This films starts out with a group of people infiltrating a cult leaders place and placing a mask on said cult leader. Very painful process and you may wonder why they felt the need to do this, it is because this man has powers and they are very deadly. Flash years later and the man who was pretty much in charge of stopping the cult leader and was once under his tutelage is now an illusionist. Well one of his tricks goes array and his wife knows that something is not quite right so she hires an investigator to find out what is going on. Enter Harry D'mour, an investigator played by Scott Bakula who I always have to wonder how did this guy not get more roles in more mainstream fare as he is a rather good actor. Well the cult leaders former cult is trying to revive him and this is something that must be stopped, because this guy is like evil. You will get to find out how evil during a scene where he gives the gift of rain to his followers that is really quite freaky. Had some good qualities in this one, but so much more could of been done. The kills though are good, the story is pretty good too, I just find the ending a bit underdone, I was expecting more. However, all in all a rather good offering from writer Clive Barker.

    This was a pretty decent film. The story line was good but went way over the top by the end and it almost ruined the whole thing. The cast is class A. Scott Bakula is great and funny in the film. Kevin J. O'Connor is good and comes off kind of creepy. Famke Janssen is a good female lead. Daniel Von Bargen is really crazy in this film and was a good evil lead. There are many good side characters as well, but my favorite is played by Barry Del as Sherman. Talk about one messed up creepy character. The film has some decent special effects for its time and it may not make you jump out of your seat, but you will still mentally feel scared. It really does have that creepy feeling. Clive Barker really did a decent job on this film.

    What the &@#% is this @$&%!?!? First off, I have always loved Clive Barker films more perhaps than any other author in the genre because the books are primarily kept in line with the stories and maintain a strong visual representation to his original vision. Hellraiser, Nightbreed, Dread, and Books of Blood all while suffering changes, maintained the vision. This movie... this movie does not in any shape of the imagination. The first problem I have is with the way characters are portrayed. Butterfield is transformed form a high powered attorney to a homosexual sadomasochist looking thing, Swann is portrayed as this young 90s hipster looking thing rather than a man that that woman he's seducing at the beginning of the novella comments that she prefers men 20 years younger than, Dorotheia is a child who was saved from cult activities rather than a prostitute, and there are just so many things wrong with Valentine (like the lack of him being a demon) that I don't want to start. Then we have the problem with the movie itself. The idea of "cremate Swann before the Gulfs can tear his soul apart" story of the novella was very good and very compelling. It was a fascinating read that I didn't want to let go of until it done. This travesty with Nix, and cults, and scenes taken from "Sins of the Father" was a jumbled mess that stomped all over the plot points which made the original story so good. My belief? Read the novella and watch this merely as a companion piece. Because quite honestly it comes down to this: Stephen King had the ABC miniseries It that debased the work it came from... well Clive Barker has this movie to his credit.

    I voted 10 on this simply because it deserves it.... every aspect of this movie was done so well, you would not question any of it to begin with. Clive Barker has a unique style in how he portrays and paints his characters, and the ones here shine brightly. As usual, there is plenty of blood, and sinister happenings in the world of magic, where psychos with god like powers are raging mad, getting killed, resurrecting from the dead, faking deaths... do not want to spoil it for you. Scott Bakula deliver in my opinion the role of his career as the NY detective D'amour with a connection to the spirit world, whether good or evil. the same can be said for Daniel von Bargen, that guy that always seems to be a cop or s.w.a.t. team member in every movie you see. Well in this one, he's the ultimate personification of evil. like with the original Hellraiser, Barker paints all of the emotions and dark feelings of the human mind and heart very well once again with Lord of Illusions.

    Horror movies that audiences connect with are usually about some familiar threat, like vampires, werewolves, zombies, monsters, killer animals, or just serial killers with or without masks on. Clive Barker's work has more in common with H.P. Lovecraft, in that it attempts to describe mythologies and threats that are either obscure or totally unknown to the viewer. The risk is always that the audience might not "get it". It's hard to be scared about something unless you know what it is. It's even harder to stay interested in a movie unless you have a good idea of what's going on. "Lord of Illusions" leaves the viewer in the dark for so long that it becomes tedious, giving us bizarre manifestations that don't really mean anything until the movie's almost over. By that point, it's too late. I found it reminiscent of "Hellraiser", darkly fascinating but ultimately ridiculous in the way it inserts bizarre characters doing bizarre things with motivations that we don't understand. I did like the way he made it reminiscent of film noir. His special effects are ambitious, even if they usually look silly. His gruesome trademark of violating human bodies in hideous ways is represented here, so if you're into that, you definitely won't be disappointed.

    A far cry away from the classic The Warlock. Decent horror flick with some under-written script issues. Generally fine with some eerie moments, but the plot is all around the place with no real focus on the who, what and where. Nonetheless a blast from the past from the 90s is a welcome breather for the gorno crapfest we are dished out nowadays. Nix (Daniel von Bargen) is the leader of a cult. Due to dark dealings he has amassed incredible power, which he hopes to share with Philip Swann (Kevin J. O'Connor). Disgusted with the evil and destruction that Nix represents Swann with a group of friends decide to end his terrible reign and save the young Dorothea. They manage to capture the magician and bury him deep underground. 13 years later Philip Swann is a world renowned illusionist and is married to the grown up Dorothea (Famke Jannsen). The cult following of Nix has never revoked their beliefs and are still intent on freeing their master. Dorothea hires a PI with a knack for the occult, Harry D'Amour (Scott Bakula) to look after her husband. Swann however mysteriously dies during his latest illusion... There is a lot to like about this movie together with its retro feel from the great days of the 80s/90s horrors. Plus Clive Barker always supplies eerie occult atmosphere even if he is a bit iffy on the plot side of things. A couple of great and relatively scary scenes make this a worthwhile watch, even if the lack of direction to the story is frustrating. The Scott Bakula character feels superfluous and unnecessary, albeit Bakula does a good acting job and is a standout character. Nonetheless the movie seems to introduce characters and situations just so that we get gore and occult magic here and there, but there really is no purpose to the plot. Could be better, but still a decent 5.

    Way back in the when, Lord of Illusions was the last film that my parents ever made me turn off when I started watching it on television. They were unamused by a scene with a tied up young girl and a mandrill, and so I ended up not seeing the film until some years later. I've seen it a few times now, and though perhaps the least of Clive Barkers great forays into direction, lacking the immense gruesome brilliance of Hellraiser or the thrilling monster laden madness of Nightbreed, it is more coherent than Nightbreed and acres ahead of most horror fare of the mid 90's. The plot sees a private investigator, Harry D'Amour becoming embroiled in the dangerous world of magic, through dealing with a great illusionist named Swann with a dark past involving an evildoer named Nix. The opening to this film is superb, a flashback to a cult compound led by the malign Nix, with an incredibly chilling atmosphere and some disturbing moments. As the film moves to the modern day and centers around D'Amour things slow down and go more into a sort of fantasy noir territory, though not without splashes of grue and a good deal of foreboding, as things heat up again in building to coming excitement. Acting wise Kevin J. O'Connor is great as Swann, twitchy, nervous and pretty weird, wholly convincing as a man of great powers but beset by fears. As his beautiful wife, Famke Jansenn is a tad underused but is good on the eye and carries her role nicely. Scott Bakula is vaguely bland as D'Amour, but I thought this relatively weak pairing worked well as a counterpoint to the spiralling madness around them. Most interesting are Barry del Sherman as gay hit-man Butterfield, with a kinky, sinister edge and a performance of ferocious physicality, especially in a couple of fights and Daniel von Bargen as Nix, playing the role with a booming malevolence that is less scary horror villain and more fantastical demon. The film is generally well written, with some great lines, especially for the bad characters and von Bargen gives all of his evil dialogue maximum power. As well as the dialogue working nicely, there is also a lot of thematic interest, with some gay themes relating to Butterfield and his partner, the relationship between Swann and Nix and also tied into the whole business of magic and its practitioners or those involved with it in the film. The film takes a freaky look at cult obsession and magic too. The only real problems I had with this film relate to some of the special effects work and the ending. There are some instances where animation effects are used that really date the film and don't look terribly good. Normally I wouldn't criticise effects in a film but better ones were used in Hellraiser and Nightbreed and in the case of Hellraiser some were of a similar type to ones in Lord of Illusions but done much better. Also, the finale is a tad unsatisfying in some respects, definitely less grisly than it should have been and a bit cheesy. Its fun, but definitely doesn't match the opening or some other moments in the film. More nastiness splashed over the course of the film might have been nice too, but things stay interesting anyway so I can't complain to much. Altogether, this is a rich, potent and sometimes pretty scary horror film, Barker does a fine job directing for the most part, handling tension and nastiness with great skill and maintaining a sinister bubbling brew of potent horror throughout. He has done better, but I still recommend this highly indeed, one of the best horror films of the 90's.
