  A civilian diving team are enlisted to search for a lost nuclear submarine and face danger while encountering an alien aquatic species.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  An American nuclear submarine encounters an alien species, which coincidentally causes massive electrical and hydraulic malfunctions, causing the sub to crash into an underwater cliff and sink. The navy asks the workers of a nearby underwater oil rig who are joined by a number of navy SEALS to locate and investigate the cause of the crash. As the crew embark on their mission, they encounter a number of difficulties and discover that they may not be alone. There is something else down there.

    James Cameron has made many great films over his career, including The Terminator, Terminator 2 and Aliens. But The Abyss is often forgotten when compared to his other films and was a box office flop when it was first released. An American Navy sub mysteriously sinks in the Cayman Trough at the height of the Cold War. With the American Navy unable to launch their own recuse operation they hire an oil drilling crew working on an experimental underwater oil platform. The US SEALs, the crew and the platform's designer, Lindsey Brigman (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) personalities start to clash underworld, with the SEALs' leader, Lt. Coffey (Michael Biehn) suffering from pressure madness, America and the Soviet Union moving closer to war and the potential discovery of alien life in the depths the ocean. The Abyss is a very tight, claustrophobic thriller which is very much about paranoid and distrust like The Thing and about the delicate state the world was in during the Cold War. The Abyss is a very character driven film, with all the characters being very distinct and memorial. I personally feared that some of the characters were going to only defined by their quirks or traits such as one of them being a conspiracy theorist and has a pet rat and other one is a woman in a cowboy hat and listens to country music, but the characters slowly get more fleshed out and likable as the film progress, particularly the relationship between Lindsey and Bud (Ed Harris). The team is as memorable as the Marines in Aliens, but there still leave an impression. Compared to most of Cameron's filmography, The Abyss is an action light film and more like a sci-fi film of old. As already mentioned that The Abyss does share similarities to The Thing because of its themes and basic settling (a group of highly trained personnel isolated in an extreme environment). At the end of the special edition The Abyss in the Special Edition also shares a lot of similarities to The Day the Earth Stood Still, with a little bit of 2010: The Year We Made Contact near the end and this is when Cameron goes on his soapbox about war and nuclear disarmament. For the time the special effects were incredible, using a combination of models and minitures and CGI. The water effects particularly hold up, especially when you still see water effect being very hard to do, like in The Last Airbender. The aliens too also had a unique design, looking like glowing stringrays with the pink, purple and blue lights and the aliens themselves had a mix of a classic grey alien look with more colour to them. Composer Alan Silverstri was also able to add to the visuals with an excellent score, using many different styles. There were heavy drums for the military to a softer choir when we see the aliens are present, giving them a divine presence. The Abyss is a long film and the Special Edition is over two and half hours and near the end the film The Abyss does start to drag. This is not helped when Cameron becomes more preachy and a little cheesy when Bud meets the aliens. The Abyss is a thoughtful, character driven sci-fi from Mr Cameron that reflects more older sci-fi films and shows that special effects should be used more then just for spectacle.

    I really do not usually do this but I was just watching this and I wanted to take a second and say this could easily be Ed Harris' best acting role, He is an amazing actor and it really shows and all this time I always said Needful things was his best, but Ill give it up to this one instead. Everyone is awesome in this film and its one I have always liked but it really moved me a little bit today and I wanted to say if you haven't watched it yet, you should. The film is amazing for being from the early 90's its really well done, No wonder Cameron is the best and has the best movies. This one really holds up for being 20 years old.

    James Cameron directs this ambitious, visually sumptuous but long adventure about a deep-sea oil rig crew who encounter mysterious occurrences that lead to the discovery of aliens, who are friendly, but who also want to be left alone it seems... Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio are compelling and believable as embattled employee/employer & husband/wife, who are at continual odds, but over the course of this story, become closer and closer, as both come close to death, and are also threatened by a crewman who goes crazy(Michael Bien) a plot point that goes on too long, as does this film, though it does come together eventually, there are some lulls in the pace of the film that hurt, but it is still worth watching, with spectacular end sequence(restored Director's Cut version).

    If you think about James Cameron movies, a film like "The Abyss" is not one that would pop into many people's brains. Maybe even less known than Cameron's film "True Lies", "The Abyss" is suspense at its best and further demonstrates Cameron's knack for story and characters in cinema. After a submarine is brought down to the depths by an unknown force that turns out to be alien, an underwater drilling base is usurped by the Navy team led by Lt. Coffey (Michael Biehn) to investigate the disaster. The people in charge of the drilling base, Bud (Ed Harris) and Lindsey (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), ex-spouses, work together to stop Coffey from destroying the alien species and rekindle their love. While "Avatar" is believed to be the most insightful film that portrays Cameron for an artist, I believe it is this film that does that. This film has a message beyond "Avatar's" businesses are greedy and want to take things from the weak. The message here is about being kind to one another and even though no one can be nice to everyone, it reminds you that being loving or nice to one person makes all the difference. This is one of the few films where I think it actually made me feel sad at the parts I was supposed to and happy at the parts I was supposed to, thanks to the brilliant acting by the whole cast and the powerful directing and writing that Cameron put into the story. "The Abyss" is a completely underrated work of art that has a better message and is able to succeed without all of the fancy effects and action scenes that Cameron is normally known for. Yes, this film has action but it deals more with the character drama alongside the struggle and not the drama being a subplot to the main struggle.

    The Abyss plays like a more extravagant, more mature and more interesting version of director James Cameron's 1984 breakout hit "The Terminator". Therein, we witness what is essentially a love story which happens to have an awful lot of general flak revolving around non-human entities and a range of supporting acts skewering proceedings playing out around it. There are special effects and a distinctly science fictitious atmosphere of fear of the unknown to proceedings, but nothing that matches neither the aggression of The Terminator nor the tendency to rely too heavily on B-movie convention. I don't think it would be at all untrue to label The Abyss as one of Cameron's best work. I view it a combination of the various traits that made up what the man was known for at this time in his career: we have the underwater set/ocean based narrative of Piranha II: The Spawning combining with that very claustrophobic atmosphere of Aliens, as something that's supernatural lurks out there ready for you, furthermore combining with that aforementioned idea of two people coming together under extraordinary circumstances before realising just how much they have in common while the exterior elements brood. Later on, the film even goes so far as to channel Paul Riser's character from Aliens when someone gets their own big ideas on how to deal with the newfound entity apparent in their company. The conflict in those three examples was, of course, much more obvious than it is here  a killer robot; a shoal of killer fish and a pack of killer extra-terrestrials, three things of which can only be so interesting for so long. The Abyss may be a slower and more patient film in its covering of events and depiction of character, but it at least has a little more to depict in the events column than mere second unit action. The film is additionally richer out of the fact its ambiguity and tendency to avoid straight up human heroes and non-human villains. Akin to Cameron's previous work, The Abyss covers a group of people in an inescapable situation made worse out of the fact they have to come to deal with a potentially non-human entity  a non-human entity whose first action during the opening sequence appeared to be to lure a submarine to its doom. The film is, despite this, so much more than how that sounds. Ed Harris leads a team of oil drillers whose expertise is in doing such a thing at great depths beneath the sea, a team of people recruited by the government to uncover precisely why it was that aforementioned submarine crashed and burned like it did. Although, one can hardly crash AND burn when one is underwater... The crew is distinguished by Harris' character Virgil Brigman and that of Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's Lindsey, two people who were once married but now maintain their professional relationship with one another in a working capacity. Also down there is a group of Navy SEALS, whose presence is that of protection should whatever caused the crash still be down there and still be dangerous. Lindsey is the lone female presence and Cameron plays with us in the manner he did when depicting one of the few feminine presences in his prior film Aliens. This occurs when one of the SEAL members asks Harris' character if she should be referred to as "sir", raising the issue of what's expected of specific genders in these sorts of projects: we have already witnessed hard-line female space marines who are as powerful as their male counterparts and a complete overhaul of the Sarah Connor character in The Terminator, whose passing from servant (waitress) to solider was there depicted. There is also a great deal of effectiveness in the way Cameron goes about depicting this newfound world the characters find themselves in. While we are a long way from both the inter-planetary colonies found in Aliens and the way in which Cameron attempts to make a parallel between the Los Angeles of 1984 (the setting for Terminator) and a god-forsaken post nuclear war Los Angeles of the 21st Century, the underwater setting here might just as well be somewhere futuristic and unreal for the feeling it evokes. There is a real vulnerability to the setting and its surroundings and as a tropical storm rages above on the surface severing communication with that which can only be defined as 'the outside world'. The film additionally toys with oxygen levels, deep-sea pressure and all the important apparatus required when one is this deep below the Earth's surface. There is a nasty, gooey feeling to these scenes such as there would be if one was in outer space and oxygen quantity in tow with levels of pressure were too vital. As far as dramas go, rarely does a film avoid a misstep like The Abyss does. The piece is, ultimately, the template for an adventure to allow for former romances to be rekindled while its attitude towards its premise that sees it resemble a deep-sea rescue/disaster film with a science fiction twist is the sort of Cameron genre hybridisation I can live with. One of the film's more crucial ideas revolves around when it is the entities make their presence known and to whom they appear. Many are the times wherein we watch as the character most prone to fits of hysterics is the one whose 'contact' is made first  thus, few are believers. Such is The Abyss' inherent maturity that when that happens here, it is not the character closest to psychological meltdown whose condition is abused for meek dramatics. Indeed, they are calm and measured enough to merely report that they thought they were dead on account of "seeing an Angel" approach them. The Abyss is not the Cameron film that has captured the imaginations of the many over the years, but it enthralled me.

    James Cameron's first budget-buster, this underwater sci-fi thriller briefly spawned a swarm of rip-offs, just about all of them simply Alien clones set underwater. The Abyss is more in the vein of Close Encounters, though there's a strong whiff of Aliens in some scenes. Unlike those films, this one isn't trash. It's a serious, ambitious epic, with some awe-inspiring visuals. The Oscar-winning special effects are still a joy to behold. Production design is impressive. The score adds to the epic feel. As always with Cameron, we can expect intense, relentless set-pieces, and he doesn't disappoint, with a memorable opener, disaster hitting the undersea rig, and growing hostility between the protagonists, and an unstable Navy SEAL. And on top of that, the growing suspicion they're not alone down there... A truly impressive film, but it isn't quite up there with the best of Cameron's. Filming underwater scenes always presents pacing problems, and this film is no exception. There are many long-winded, sluggish moments that cause the film to drag at times. The anti-war anti-nuke sermonizing is stronger here than in the Terminator films, and is heavy-handed to the point that it couldn't be any less subtle if the heroes were all wearing peace symbols and No Nuke T-shirts. The cast are good enough, but at times performances verge on overly histrionic, especially at the climax with Lindsay - Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonion - talking to estranged hubbie Bud - Ed Harris - as he descends into the titular crevice to defuse a nuke. I don't think much of a spoiler to reveal the aliens are friendly, as the film more than signposted that in earlier scenes. This does however present a problem - whereas the aliens in Close Encounters didn't seem aware they were causing harm by snatching the boy, it seems conveniently forgotten all of a sudden that the aliens in The Abyss inadvertently caused the deaths of the entire crew of a missile submarine. The Special Edition is even longer, close to 3 hours, but it helps flesh characters out a bit more, and we see the aliens aren't entirely sweet-natured, as they come close to causing a terrible catastrophe to avert a possible conflict between the US and the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, the Cold War subplot of the Special Edition, means it hasn't dated as well storywise as the theatrical release. A flawed film to be sure, but a likable often impressive one.

    This is a tough one. The movie holds you almost to the end in a gripping fight between good and evil. I don't want to give out any spoilers. So, I will be brief. Have you ever had a wonderful dinner at a restaurant and then they bring in a dessert, if you have room in your tummy, and it is a, let's say, beautiful, mouth-watering, delicious tasting creation. As you eat it, every bite causes you to pause to seal in your memory the sensation. Then, it breaks! You find a hair in your mouth, or worse yet, a fingernail! UGH!! Such repulsion. THAT is the sensation one gets when, after an edge-sitting, nail-biting movie, you come to the last 10 minutes or so and find you are have someone else's hair or nail in your mouth. Just note that Hollywood was really stupid to put their politically motivated morals which no terrorist or anti-American-of-old nation would ever consider. In fact, the ending was childish. The end.

    I like Cameron as a worker. I shudder when he makes what he thinks as art. The film helps explain a good deal, I think. It is in three layers, each one revealing of the man, his ethos, and a few cool things about filmmaking in general. The first layer is where a bunch of bureaucrat navy types decide on a course of action to avoid world destruction. This is where story-noise of our film is shaped, and everything we see of that story is dumb and mechanistic. Done by commission. Coincidence? The second layer is the first below water and Cameron's working space. We see a lot of rigs and hydraulic machinery here, the people are distinctly blue-collar types, the 'director' of the underwater enterprise has marital problems, as did Cameron at the time. Emphasis here is on getting a (cinematic) job done, which the film delivers with finely-tuned 'disaster movie' dynamics. A thrill ride as good as any part of Aliens. So far so good. Efficient but unspectacular. The third layer is deep in the abyss, where the 'director' takes a hopeless leap -sure to kill him- but instead is salvaged by miraculous creatures of the imagination, who supposedly have a city down there and quietly monitor humanity. Everything here amazes - deep , organic clarity in the architecture of both the arabesque city and alien creatures, the way the camera navigates by swimming inside, the textures of diaphanous light. The room where the meeting takes place and the creatures project mind-images on liquid screens is one of the most cinematic occasions I know. I cherish the film for just this scene. None of this is originally Cameron's though. It is by a man who probably changed sci-fi as much as Jules Verne, his name Moebius. You will know him chiefly through Alien and the BladeRunner, but his influence is more far-reaching than that. Now here's the problem with Cameron. The three layers have to be flattened so as to get resolutions, at least that's his plan. By nature of the thing, it's got to be settled above water, on the level of dumb story. Bad choice. Again, everything is on a huge scale. This has been a steady course of action for Cameron, since his days of rigging contraptions in Corman's movie factory. He was excellent in his work. With each success of these machines, their size got bigger, and as a result their narrative cogs grew bigger and bigger, and with so much success, so did Cameron's desire to 'educate' his audience with something constructive, since his machines were always geared for war and destruction. Like Spielberg, the more of destruction he shows, the more he feels compelled to stress out 'humane' aspects in his work. Individually, the imagery of the aliens averting nuclear war by threatening world destruction is spectacular, especially that of tsunamis arrested in their course - incidentally linking us back to the palpitating liquid walls of Moebius. But the resolution on that same grand scale is mechanically humane, pure contrivance. Cameron would grow in this direction, extending his engineer's reach from effects and machines to entire computer-generated environments, and pushing his desire to 'give back' and educate with a series of documentaries and epically hamfisted 'messages' in his films.

    The Abyss is a 1989 science fiction film, which can be characterized as an well made typical Hollywood blockbuster. If we could classify by genre, it would be a film in the underwater Alien encounter genre. It has many typical elements of a James Cameron film, such as a fairly cartoonish set of main and secondary characters and a typical love story. The film is the set in the "present day" (late 1980′s) when a nuclear submarine is intercepted and sunk by an unknown underwater object. A team of hard working divers is sent to investigate. Cameron said that he had the idea of the film's story since he was in high school, which was a story of a group of scientists working in a underwater laboratory. He changed to a group of commercial blue collar diving workers to increase the film's commercial appeal. This group of divers eventually discovers that it was a non-human intelligent lifeform that caused the accident. The special effects were the best in the world at the time the film was made, in the 1989, and they are among the main attraction of the film. The characters are also interesting, though they are a bit simple.

    The Abyss was a film that I heard a lot about on forums and saw plenty of ''if you like this, you may like...'' from Amazon, IMDb, Lovefilm, etc when looking at other films relating to the deep sea and sci-fi thrillers. So I thought I'll check it out. I found it quite entertaining for a while and interesting for the most parts. The characters were basic but understandable and you got to know the setting and situation they are in. The parts which drew you in the most were the scenes with the ''organisms'' (NTI's) flying around the base, it was mysterious and you were drawn closer as you become curious to know what they were. Much later in the film with the scene where Ed Harris jumps down into the trench to find the warhead, was when it started to get a bit absurd as he ventures into the extreme depths, but hey it's a sci-fi, so why complain right? It was actually gripping to see him go so deep. Although 5 minutes from that, the film took another route and that's when Cameron started waterboarding me with his typical ethics and morality vomit that his films are known for. I couldn't help but sulk at the end when we find out that the NTI's had been there the whole time and are going to flood all the land above due to humans destructive nature. The whole film right up to the scene where Ed Harris' character is communicating with the NTI's is a good movie, borderline great as it was entertaining, but when that scene started, it threw everything away which it had built. Suddenly I lost all interest and did not care. This film would have been an 8 from me, but due to Cameron failing to resist his classic urge to try and make the human race feel guilty, I had to sink it to a 6. Never the less, I still recommend this movie!

This is one of the few films where I think it actually made me feel sad at the parts I was supposed to and happy at the parts I was supposed to, thanks to the brilliant acting by the whole cast and the powerful directing and writing that Cameron put into the story. "The Abyss" is a completely underrated work of art that has a better message and is able to succeed without all of the fancy effects and action scenes that Cameron is normally known for. Yes, this film has action but it deals more with the character drama alongside the struggle and not the drama being a subplot to the main struggle.

    The Abyss plays like a more extravagant, more mature and more interesting version of director James Cameron's 1984 breakout hit "The Terminator". Therein, we witness what is essentially a love story which happens to have an awful lot of general flak revolving around non-human entities and a range of supporting acts skewering proceedings playing out around it. There are special effects and a distinctly science fictitious atmosphere of fear of the unknown to proceedings, but nothing that matches neither the aggression of The Terminator nor the tendency to rely too heavily on B-movie convention. I don't think it would be at all untrue to label The Abyss as one of Cameron's best work. I view it a combination of the various traits that made up what the man was known for at this time in his career: we have the underwater set/ocean based narrative of Piranha II: The Spawning combining with that very claustrophobic atmosphere of Aliens, as something that's supernatural lurks out there ready for you, furthermore combining with that aforementioned idea of two people coming together under extraordinary circumstances before realising just how much they have in common while the exterior elements brood. Later on, the film even goes so far as to channel Paul Riser's character from Aliens when someone gets their own big ideas on how to deal with the newfound entity apparent in their company. The conflict in those three examples was, of course, much more obvious than it is here  a killer robot; a shoal of killer fish and a pack of killer extra-terrestrials, three things of which can only be so interesting for so long. The Abyss may be a slower and more patient film in its covering of events and depiction of character, but it at least has a little more to depict in the events column than mere second unit action. The film is additionally richer out of the fact its ambiguity and tendency to avoid straight up human heroes and non-human villains. Akin to Cameron's previous work, The Abyss covers a group of people in an inescapable situation made worse out of the fact they have to come to deal with a potentially non-human entity  a non-human entity whose first action during the opening sequence appeared to be to lure a submarine to its doom. The film is, despite this, so much more than how that sounds. Ed Harris leads a team of oil drillers whose expertise is in doing such a thing at great depths beneath the sea, a team of people recruited by the government to uncover precisely why it was that aforementioned submarine crashed and burned like it did. Although, one can hardly crash AND burn when one is underwater... The crew is distinguished by Harris' character Virgil Brigman and that of Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's Lindsey, two people who were once married but now maintain their professional relationship with one another in a working capacity. Also down there is a group of Navy SEALS, whose presence is that of protection should whatever caused the crash still be down there and still be dangerous. Lindsey is the lone female presence and Cameron plays with us in the manner he did when depicting one of the few feminine presences in his prior film Aliens. This occurs when one of the SEAL members asks Harris' character if she should be referred to as "sir", raising the issue of what's expected of specific genders in these sorts of projects: we have already witnessed hard-line female space marines who are as powerful as their male counterparts and a complete overhaul of the Sarah Connor character in The Terminator, whose passing from servant (waitress) to solider was there depicted. There is also a great deal of effectiveness in the way Cameron goes about depicting this newfound world the characters find themselves in. While we are a long way from both the inter-planetary colonies found in Aliens and the way in which Cameron attempts to make a parallel between the Los Angeles of 1984 (the setting for Terminator) and a god-forsaken post nuclear war Los Angeles of the 21st Century, the underwater setting here might just as well be somewhere futuristic and unreal for the feeling it evokes. There is a real vulnerability to the setting and its surroundings and as a tropical storm rages above on the surface severing communication with that which can only be defined as 'the outside world'. The film additionally toys with oxygen levels, deep-sea pressure and all the important apparatus required when one is this deep below the Earth's surface. There is a nasty, gooey feeling to these scenes such as there would be if one was in outer space and oxygen quantity in tow with levels of pressure were too vital. As far as dramas go, rarely does a film avoid a misstep like The Abyss does. The piece is, ultimately, the template for an adventure to allow for former romances to be rekindled while its attitude towards its premise that sees it resemble a deep-sea rescue/disaster film with a science fiction twist is the sort of Cameron genre hybridisation I can live with. One of the film's more crucial ideas revolves around when it is the entities make their presence known and to whom they appear. Many are the times wherein we watch as the character most prone to fits of hysterics is the one whose 'contact' is made first  thus, few are believers. Such is The Abyss' inherent maturity that when that happens here, it is not the character closest to psychological meltdown whose condition is abused for meek dramatics. Indeed, they are calm and measured enough to merely report that they thought they were dead on account of "seeing an Angel" approach them. The Abyss is not the Cameron film that has captured the imaginations of the many over the years, but it enthralled me.

    James Cameron's first budget-buster, this underwater sci-fi thriller briefly spawned a swarm of rip-offs, just about all of them simply Alien clones set underwater. The Abyss is more in the vein of Close Encounters, though there's a strong whiff of Aliens in some scenes. Unlike those films, this one isn't trash. It's a serious, ambitious epic, with some awe-inspiring visuals. The Oscar-winning special effects are still a joy to behold. Production design is impressive. The score adds to the epic feel. As always with Cameron, we can expect intense, relentless set-pieces, and he doesn't disappoint, with a memorable opener, disaster hitting the undersea rig, and growing hostility between the protagonists, and an unstable Navy SEAL. And on top of that, the growing suspicion they're not alone down there... A truly impressive film, but it isn't quite up there with the best of Cameron's. Filming underwater scenes always presents pacing problems, and this film is no exception. There are many long-winded, sluggish moments that cause the film to drag at times. The anti-war anti-nuke sermonizing is stronger here than in the Terminator films, and is heavy-handed to the point that it couldn't be any less subtle if the heroes were all wearing peace symbols and No Nuke T-shirts. The cast are good enough, but at times performances verge on overly histrionic, especially at the climax with Lindsay - Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonion - talking to estranged hubbie Bud - Ed Harris - as he descends into the titular crevice to defuse a nuke. I don't think much of a spoiler to reveal the aliens are friendly, as the film more than signposted that in earlier scenes. This does however present a problem - whereas the aliens in Close Encounters didn't seem aware they were causing harm by snatching the boy, it seems conveniently forgotten all of a sudden that the aliens in The Abyss inadvertently caused the deaths of the entire crew of a missile submarine. The Special Edition is even longer, close to 3 hours, but it helps flesh characters out a bit more, and we see the aliens aren't entirely sweet-natured, as they come close to causing a terrible catastrophe to avert a possible conflict between the US and the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, the Cold War subplot of the Special Edition, means it hasn't dated as well storywise as the theatrical release. A flawed film to be sure, but a likable often impressive one.

    This is a tough one. The movie holds you almost to the end in a gripping fight between good and evil. I don't want to give out any spoilers. So, I will be brief. Have you ever had a wonderful dinner at a restaurant and then they bring in a dessert, if you have room in your tummy, and it is a, let's say, beautiful, mouth-watering, delicious tasting creation. As you eat it, every bite causes you to pause to seal in your memory the sensation. Then, it breaks! You find a hair in your mouth, or worse yet, a fingernail! UGH!! Such repulsion. THAT is the sensation one gets when, after an edge-sitting, nail-biting movie, you come to the last 10 minutes or so and find you are have someone else's hair or nail in your mouth. Just note that Hollywood was really stupid to put their politically motivated morals which no terrorist or anti-American-of-old nation would ever consider. In fact, the ending was childish. The end.

    I like Cameron as a worker. I shudder when he makes what he thinks as art. The film helps explain a good deal, I think. It is in three layers, each one revealing of the man, his ethos, and a few cool things about filmmaking in general. The first layer is where a bunch of bureaucrat navy types decide on a course of action to avoid world destruction. This is where story-noise of our film is shaped, and everything we see of that story is dumb and mechanistic. Done by commission. Coincidence? The second layer is the first below water and Cameron's working space. We see a lot of rigs and hydraulic machinery here, the people are distinctly blue-collar types, the 'director' of the underwater enterprise has marital problems, as did Cameron at the time. Emphasis here is on getting a (cinematic) job done, which the film delivers with finely-tuned 'disaster movie' dynamics. A thrill ride as good as any part of Aliens. So far so good. Efficient but unspectacular. The third layer is deep in the abyss, where the 'director' takes a hopeless leap -sure to kill him- but instead is salvaged by miraculous creatures of the imagination, who supposedly have a city down there and quietly monitor humanity. Everything here amazes - deep , organic clarity in the architecture of both the arabesque city and alien creatures, the way the camera navigates by swimming inside, the textures of diaphanous light. The room where the meeting takes place and the creatures project mind-images on liquid screens is one of the most cinematic occasions I know. I cherish the film for just this scene. None of this is originally Cameron's though. It is by a man who probably changed sci-fi as much as Jules Verne, his name Moebius. You will know him chiefly through Alien and the BladeRunner, but his influence is more far-reaching than that. Now here's the problem with Cameron. The three layers have to be flattened so as to get resolutions, at least that's his plan. By nature of the thing, it's got to be settled above water, on the level of dumb story. Bad choice. Again, everything is on a huge scale. This has been a steady course of action for Cameron, since his days of rigging contraptions in Corman's movie factory. He was excellent in his work. With each success of these machines, their size got bigger, and as a result their narrative cogs grew bigger and bigger, and with so much success, so did Cameron's desire to 'educate' his audience with something constructive, since his machines were always geared for war and destruction. Like Spielberg, the more of destruction he shows, the more he feels compelled to stress out 'humane' aspects in his work. Individually, the imagery of the aliens averting nuclear war by threatening world destruction is spectacular, especially that of tsunamis arrested in their course - incidentally linking us back to the palpitating liquid walls of Moebius. But the resolution on that same grand scale is mechanically humane, pure contrivance. Cameron would grow in this direction, extending his engineer's reach from effects and machines to entire computer-generated environments, and pushing his desire to 'give back' and educate with a series of documentaries and epically hamfisted 'messages' in his films.

    The Abyss is a 1989 science fiction film, which can be characterized as an well made typical Hollywood blockbuster. If we could classify by genre, it would be a film in the underwater Alien encounter genre. It has many typical elements of a James Cameron film, such as a fairly cartoonish set of main and secondary characters and a typical love story. The film is the set in the "present day" (late 1980′s) when a nuclear submarine is intercepted and sunk by an unknown underwater object. A team of hard working divers is sent to investigate. Cameron said that he had the idea of the film's story since he was in high school, which was a story of a group of scientists working in a underwater laboratory. He changed to a group of commercial blue collar diving workers to increase the film's commercial appeal. This group of divers eventually discovers that it was a non-human intelligent lifeform that caused the accident. The special effects were the best in the world at the time the film was made, in the 1989, and they are among the main attraction of the film. The characters are also interesting, though they are a bit simple.

    The Abyss was a film that I heard a lot about on forums and saw plenty of ''if you like this, you may like...'' from Amazon, IMDb, Lovefilm, etc when looking at other films relating to the deep sea and sci-fi thrillers. So I thought I'll check it out. I found it quite entertaining for a while and interesting for the most parts. The characters were basic but understandable and you got to know the setting and situation they are in. The parts which drew you in the most were the scenes with the ''organisms'' (NTI's) flying around the base, it was mysterious and you were drawn closer as you become curious to know what they were. Much later in the film with the scene where Ed Harris jumps down into the trench to find the warhead, was when it started to get a bit absurd as he ventures into the extreme depths, but hey it's a sci-fi, so why complain right? It was actually gripping to see him go so deep. Although 5 minutes from that, the film took another route and that's when Cameron started waterboarding me with his typical ethics and morality vomit that his films are known for. I couldn't help but sulk at the end when we find out that the NTI's had been there the whole time and are going to flood all the land above due to humans destructive nature. The whole film right up to the scene where Ed Harris' character is communicating with the NTI's is a good movie, borderline great as it was entertaining, but when that scene started, it threw everything away which it had built. Suddenly I lost all interest and did not care. This film would have been an 8 from me, but due to Cameron failing to resist his classic urge to try and make the human race feel guilty, I had to sink it to a 6. Never the less, I still recommend this movie!

    James Cameron has made many great films over his career, including The Terminator, Terminator 2 and Aliens. But The Abyss is often forgotten when compared to his other films and was a box office flop when it was first released. An American Navy sub mysteriously sinks in the Cayman Trough at the height of the Cold War. With the American Navy unable to launch their own recuse operation they hire an oil drilling crew working on an experimental underwater oil platform. The US SEALs, the crew and the platform's designer, Lindsey Brigman (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) personalities start to clash underworld, with the SEALs' leader, Lt. Coffey (Michael Biehn) suffering from pressure madness, America and the Soviet Union moving closer to war and the potential discovery of alien life in the depths the ocean. The Abyss is a very tight, claustrophobic thriller which is very much about paranoid and distrust like The Thing and about the delicate state the world was in during the Cold War. The Abyss is a very character driven film, with all the characters being very distinct and memorial. I personally feared that some of the characters were going to only defined by their quirks or traits such as one of them being a conspiracy theorist and has a pet rat and other one is a woman in a cowboy hat and listens to country music, but the characters slowly get more fleshed out and likable as the film progress, particularly the relationship between Lindsey and Bud (Ed Harris). The team is as memorable as the Marines in Aliens, but there still leave an impression. Compared to most of Cameron's filmography, The Abyss is an action light film and more like a sci-fi film of old. As already mentioned that The Abyss does share similarities to The Thing because of its themes and basic settling (a group of highly trained personnel isolated in an extreme environment). At the end of the special edition The Abyss in the Special Edition also shares a lot of similarities to The Day the Earth Stood Still, with a little bit of 2010: The Year We Made Contact near the end and this is when Cameron goes on his soapbox about war and nuclear disarmament. For the time the special effects were incredible, using a combination of models and minitures and CGI. The water effects particularly hold up, especially when you still see water effect being very hard to do, like in The Last Airbender. The aliens too also had a unique design, looking like glowing stringrays with the pink, purple and blue lights and the aliens themselves had a mix of a classic grey alien look with more colour to them. Composer Alan Silverstri was also able to add to the visuals with an excellent score, using many different styles. There were heavy drums for the military to a softer choir when we see the aliens are present, giving them a divine presence. The Abyss is a long film and the Special Edition is over two and half hours and near the end the film The Abyss does start to drag. This is not helped when Cameron becomes more preachy and a little cheesy when Bud meets the aliens. The Abyss is a thoughtful, character driven sci-fi from Mr Cameron that reflects more older sci-fi films and shows that special effects should be used more then just for spectacle.

    I really do not usually do this but I was just watching this and I wanted to take a second and say this could easily be Ed Harris' best acting role, He is an amazing actor and it really shows and all this time I always said Needful things was his best, but Ill give it up to this one instead. Everyone is awesome in this film and its one I have always liked but it really moved me a little bit today and I wanted to say if you haven't watched it yet, you should. The film is amazing for being from the early 90's its really well done, No wonder Cameron is the best and has the best movies. This one really holds up for being 20 years old.

    James Cameron directs this ambitious, visually sumptuous but long adventure about a deep-sea oil rig crew who encounter mysterious occurrences that lead to the discovery of aliens, who are friendly, but who also want to be left alone it seems... Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio are compelling and believable as embattled employee/employer & husband/wife, who are at continual odds, but over the course of this story, become closer and closer, as both come close to death, and are also threatened by a crewman who goes crazy(Michael Bien) a plot point that goes on too long, as does this film, though it does come together eventually, there are some lulls in the pace of the film that hurt, but it is still worth watching, with spectacular end sequence(restored Director's Cut version).

    If you think about James Cameron movies, a film like "The Abyss" is not one that would pop into many people's brains. Maybe even less known than Cameron's film "True Lies", "The Abyss" is suspense at its best and further demonstrates Cameron's knack for story and characters in cinema. After a submarine is brought down to the depths by an unknown force that turns out to be alien, an underwater drilling base is usurped by the Navy team led by Lt. Coffey (Michael Biehn) to investigate the disaster. The people in charge of the drilling base, Bud (Ed Harris) and Lindsey (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), ex-spouses, work together to stop Coffey from destroying the alien species and rekindle their love. While "Avatar" is believed to be the most insightful film that portrays Cameron for an artist, I believe it is this film that does that. This film has a message beyond "Avatar's" businesses are greedy and want to take things from the weak. The message here is about being kind to one another and even though no one can be nice to everyone, it reminds you that being loving or nice to one person makes all the difference. This is one of the few films where I think it actually made me feel sad at the parts I was supposed to and happy at the parts I was supposed to, thanks to the brilliant acting by the whole cast and the powerful directing and writing that Cameron put into the story. "The Abyss" is a completely underrated work of art that has a better message and is able to succeed without all of the fancy effects and action scenes that Cameron is normally known for.

    This is a tough one. The movie holds you almost to the end in a gripping fight between good and evil. I don't want to give out any spoilers. So, I will be brief. Have you ever had a wonderful dinner at a restaurant and then they bring in a dessert, if you have room in your tummy, and it is a, let's say, beautiful, mouth-watering, delicious tasting creation. As you eat it, every bite causes you to pause to seal in your memory the sensation. Then, it breaks! You find a hair in your mouth, or worse yet, a fingernail! UGH!! Such repulsion. THAT is the sensation one gets when, after an edge-sitting, nail-biting movie, you come to the last 10 minutes or so and find you are have someone else's hair or nail in your mouth. Just note that Hollywood was really stupid to put their politically motivated morals which no terrorist or anti-American-of-old nation would ever consider. In fact, the ending was childish. The end.

    I like Cameron as a worker. I shudder when he makes what he thinks as art. The film helps explain a good deal, I think. It is in three layers, each one revealing of the man, his ethos, and a few cool things about filmmaking in general. The first layer is where a bunch of bureaucrat navy types decide on a course of action to avoid world destruction. This is where story-noise of our film is shaped, and everything we see of that story is dumb and mechanistic. Done by commission. Coincidence? The second layer is the first below water and Cameron's working space. We see a lot of rigs and hydraulic machinery here, the people are distinctly blue-collar types, the 'director' of the underwater enterprise has marital problems, as did Cameron at the time. Emphasis here is on getting a (cinematic) job done, which the film delivers with finely-tuned 'disaster movie' dynamics. A thrill ride as good as any part of Aliens. So far so good. Efficient but unspectacular. The third layer is deep in the abyss, where the 'director' takes a hopeless leap -sure to kill him- but instead is salvaged by miraculous creatures of the imagination, who supposedly have a city down there and quietly monitor humanity. Everything here amazes - deep , organic clarity in the architecture of both the arabesque city and alien creatures, the way the camera navigates by swimming inside, the textures of diaphanous light. The room where the meeting takes place and the creatures project mind-images on liquid screens is one of the most cinematic occasions I know. I cherish the film for just this scene. None of this is originally Cameron's though. It is by a man who probably changed sci-fi as much as Jules Verne, his name Moebius. You will know him chiefly through Alien and the BladeRunner, but his influence is more far-reaching than that. Now here's the problem with Cameron. The three layers have to be flattened so as to get resolutions, at least that's his plan. By nature of the thing, it's got to be settled above water, on the level of dumb story. Bad choice. Again, everything is on a huge scale. This has been a steady course of action for Cameron, since his days of rigging contraptions in Corman's movie factory. He was excellent in his work. With each success of these machines, their size got bigger, and as a result their narrative cogs grew bigger and bigger, and with so much success, so did Cameron's desire to 'educate' his audience with something constructive, since his machines were always geared for war and destruction. Like Spielberg, the more of destruction he shows, the more he feels compelled to stress out 'humane' aspects in his work. Individually, the imagery of the aliens averting nuclear war by threatening world destruction is spectacular, especially that of tsunamis arrested in their course - incidentally linking us back to the palpitating liquid walls of Moebius. But the resolution on that same grand scale is mechanically humane, pure contrivance. Cameron would grow in this direction, extending his engineer's reach from effects and machines to entire computer-generated environments, and pushing his desire to 'give back' and educate with a series of documentaries and epically hamfisted 'messages' in his films.

    The Abyss is a 1989 science fiction film, which can be characterized as an well made typical Hollywood blockbuster. If we could classify by genre, it would be a film in the underwater Alien encounter genre. It has many typical elements of a James Cameron film, such as a fairly cartoonish set of main and secondary characters and a typical love story. The film is the set in the "present day" (late 1980′s) when a nuclear submarine is intercepted and sunk by an unknown underwater object. A team of hard working divers is sent to investigate. Cameron said that he had the idea of the film's story since he was in high school, which was a story of a group of scientists working in a underwater laboratory. He changed to a group of commercial blue collar diving workers to increase the film's commercial appeal. This group of divers eventually discovers that it was a non-human intelligent lifeform that caused the accident. The special effects were the best in the world at the time the film was made, in the 1989, and they are among the main attraction of the film. The characters are also interesting, though they are a bit simple.

    The Abyss was a film that I heard a lot about on forums and saw plenty of ''if you like this, you may like...'' from Amazon, IMDb, Lovefilm, etc when looking at other films relating to the deep sea and sci-fi thrillers. So I thought I'll check it out. I found it quite entertaining for a while and interesting for the most parts. The characters were basic but understandable and you got to know the setting and situation they are in. The parts which drew you in the most were the scenes with the ''organisms'' (NTI's) flying around the base, it was mysterious and you were drawn closer as you become curious to know what they were. Much later in the film with the scene where Ed Harris jumps down into the trench to find the warhead, was when it started to get a bit absurd as he ventures into the extreme depths, but hey it's a sci-fi, so why complain right? It was actually gripping to see him go so deep. Although 5 minutes from that, the film took another route and that's when Cameron started waterboarding me with his typical ethics and morality vomit that his films are known for. I couldn't help but sulk at the end when we find out that the NTI's had been there the whole time and are going to flood all the land above due to humans destructive nature. The whole film right up to the scene where Ed Harris' character is communicating with the NTI's is a good movie, borderline great as it was entertaining, but when that scene started, it threw everything away which it had built. Suddenly I lost all interest and did not care. This film would have been an 8 from me, but due to Cameron failing to resist his classic urge to try and make the human race feel guilty, I had to sink it to a 6. Never the less, I still recommend this movie!

    James Cameron has made many great films over his career, including The Terminator, Terminator 2 and Aliens. But The Abyss is often forgotten when compared to his other films and was a box office flop when it was first released. An American Navy sub mysteriously sinks in the Cayman Trough at the height of the Cold War. With the American Navy unable to launch their own recuse operation they hire an oil drilling crew working on an experimental underwater oil platform. The US SEALs, the crew and the platform's designer, Lindsey Brigman (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) personalities start to clash underworld, with the SEALs' leader, Lt. Coffey (Michael Biehn) suffering from pressure madness, America and the Soviet Union moving closer to war and the potential discovery of alien life in the depths the ocean. The Abyss is a very tight, claustrophobic thriller which is very much about paranoid and distrust like The Thing and about the delicate state the world was in during the Cold War. The Abyss is a very character driven film, with all the characters being very distinct and memorial. I personally feared that some of the characters were going to only defined by their quirks or traits such as one of them being a conspiracy theorist and has a pet rat and other one is a woman in a cowboy hat and listens to country music, but the characters slowly get more fleshed out and likable as the film progress, particularly the relationship between Lindsey and Bud (Ed Harris). The team is as memorable as the Marines in Aliens, but there still leave an impression. Compared to most of Cameron's filmography, The Abyss is an action light film and more like a sci-fi film of old. As already mentioned that The Abyss does share similarities to The Thing because of its themes and basic settling (a group of highly trained personnel isolated in an extreme environment). At the end of the special edition The Abyss in the Special Edition also shares a lot of similarities to The Day the Earth Stood Still, with a little bit of 2010: The Year We Made Contact near the end and this is when Cameron goes on his soapbox about war and nuclear disarmament. For the time the special effects were incredible, using a combination of models and minitures and CGI. The water effects particularly hold up, especially when you still see water effect being very hard to do, like in The Last Airbender. The aliens too also had a unique design, looking like glowing stringrays with the pink, purple and blue lights and the aliens themselves had a mix of a classic grey alien look with more colour to them. Composer Alan Silverstri was also able to add to the visuals with an excellent score, using many different styles. There were heavy drums for the military to a softer choir when we see the aliens are present, giving them a divine presence. The Abyss is a long film and the Special Edition is over two and half hours and near the end the film The Abyss does start to drag. This is not helped when Cameron becomes more preachy and a little cheesy when Bud meets the aliens. The Abyss is a thoughtful, character driven sci-fi from Mr Cameron that reflects more older sci-fi films and shows that special effects should be used more then just for spectacle.

    I really do not usually do this but I was just watching this and I wanted to take a second and say this could easily be Ed Harris' best acting role, He is an amazing actor and it really shows and all this time I always said Needful things was his best, but Ill give it up to this one instead. Everyone is awesome in this film and its one I have always liked but it really moved me a little bit today and I wanted to say if you haven't watched it yet, you should. The film is amazing for being from the early 90's its really well done, No wonder Cameron is the best and has the best movies. This one really holds up for being 20 years old.

    James Cameron directs this ambitious, visually sumptuous but long adventure about a deep-sea oil rig crew who encounter mysterious occurrences that lead to the discovery of aliens, who are friendly, but who also want to be left alone it seems... Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio are compelling and believable as embattled employee/employer & husband/wife, who are at continual odds, but over the course of this story, become closer and closer, as both come close to death, and are also threatened by a crewman who goes crazy(Michael Bien) a plot point that goes on too long, as does this film, though it does come together eventually, there are some lulls in the pace of the film that hurt, but it is still worth watching, with spectacular end sequence(restored Director's Cut version).

    If you think about James Cameron movies, a film like "The Abyss" is not one that would pop into many people's brains. Maybe even less known than Cameron's film "True Lies", "The Abyss" is suspense at its best and further demonstrates Cameron's knack for story and characters in cinema. After a submarine is brought down to the depths by an unknown force that turns out to be alien, an underwater drilling base is usurped by the Navy team led by Lt. Coffey (Michael Biehn) to investigate the disaster. The people in charge of the drilling base, Bud (Ed Harris) and Lindsey (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), ex-spouses, work together to stop Coffey from destroying the alien species and rekindle their love. While "Avatar" is believed to be the most insightful film that portrays Cameron for an artist, I believe it is this film that does that. This film has a message beyond "Avatar's" businesses are greedy and want to take things from the weak. The message here is about being kind to one another and even though no one can be nice to everyone, it reminds you that being loving or nice to one person makes all the difference. This is one of the few films where I think it actually made me feel sad at the parts I was supposed to and happy at the parts I was supposed to, thanks to the brilliant acting by the whole cast and the powerful directing and writing that Cameron put into the story. "The Abyss" is a completely underrated work of art that has a better message and is able to succeed without all of the fancy effects and action scenes that Cameron is normally known for. Yes, this film has action but it deals more with the character drama alongside the struggle and not the drama being a subplot to the main struggle.

    The Abyss plays like a more extravagant, more mature and more interesting version of director James Cameron's 1984 breakout hit "The Terminator". Therein, we witness what is essentially a love story which happens to have an awful lot of general flak revolving around non-human entities and a range of supporting acts skewering proceedings playing out around it. There are special effects and a distinctly science fictitious atmosphere of fear of the unknown to proceedings, but nothing that matches neither the aggression of The Terminator nor the tendency to rely too heavily on B-movie convention. I don't think it would be at all untrue to label The Abyss as one of Cameron's best work. I view it a combination of the various traits that made up what the man was known for at this time in his career: we have the underwater set/ocean based narrative of Piranha II: The Spawning combining with that very claustrophobic atmosphere of Aliens, as something that's supernatural lurks out there ready for you, furthermore combining with that aforementioned idea of two people coming together under extraordinary circumstances before realising just how much they have in common while the exterior elements brood. Later on, the film even goes so far as to channel Paul Riser's character from Aliens when someone gets their own big ideas on how to deal with the newfound entity apparent in their company. The conflict in those three examples was, of course, much more obvious than it is here  a killer robot; a shoal of killer fish and a pack of killer extra-terrestrials, three things of which can only be so interesting for so long. The Abyss may be a slower and more patient film in its covering of events and depiction of character, but it at least has a little more to depict in the events column than mere second unit action. The film is additionally richer out of the fact its ambiguity and tendency to avoid straight up human heroes and non-human villains. Akin to Cameron's previous work, The Abyss covers a group of people in an inescapable situation made worse out of the fact they have to come to deal with a potentially non-human entity  a non-human entity whose first action during the opening sequence appeared to be to lure a submarine to its doom. The film is, despite this, so much more than how that sounds. Ed Harris leads a team of oil drillers whose expertise is in doing such a thing at great depths beneath the sea, a team of people recruited by the government to uncover precisely why it was that aforementioned submarine crashed and burned like it did. Although, one can hardly crash AND burn when one is underwater... The crew is distinguished by Harris' character Virgil Brigman and that of Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's Lindsey, two people who were once married but now maintain their professional relationship with one another in a working capacity. Also down there is a group of Navy SEALS, whose presence is that of protection should whatever caused the crash still be down there and still be dangerous. Lindsey is the lone female presence and Cameron plays with us in the manner he did when depicting one of the few feminine presences in his prior film Aliens. This occurs when one of the SEAL members asks Harris' character if she should be referred to as "sir", raising the issue of what's expected of specific genders in these sorts of projects: we have already witnessed hard-line female space marines who are as powerful as their male counterparts and a complete overhaul of the Sarah Connor character in The Terminator, whose passing from servant (waitress) to solider was there depicted. There is also a great deal of effectiveness in the way Cameron goes about depicting this newfound world the characters find themselves in. While we are a long way from both the inter-planetary colonies found in Aliens and the way in which Cameron attempts to make a parallel between the Los Angeles of 1984 (the setting for Terminator) and a god-forsaken post nuclear war Los Angeles of the 21st Century, the underwater setting here might just as well be somewhere futuristic and unreal for the feeling it evokes. There is a real vulnerability to the setting and its surroundings and as a tropical storm rages above on the surface severing communication with that which can only be defined as 'the outside world'. The film additionally toys with oxygen levels, deep-sea pressure and all the important apparatus required when one is this deep below the Earth's surface. There is a nasty, gooey feeling to these scenes such as there would be if one was in outer space and oxygen quantity in tow with levels of pressure were too vital. As far as dramas go, rarely does a film avoid a misstep like The Abyss does. The piece is, ultimately, the template for an adventure to allow for former romances to be rekindled while its attitude towards its premise that sees it resemble a deep-sea rescue/disaster film with a science fiction twist is the sort of Cameron genre hybridisation I can live with. One of the film's more crucial ideas revolves around when it is the entities make their presence known and to whom they appear. Many are the times wherein we watch as the character most prone to fits of hysterics is the one whose 'contact' is made first  thus, few are believers. Such is The Abyss' inherent maturity that when that happens here, it is not the character closest to psychological meltdown whose condition is abused for meek dramatics. Indeed, they are calm and measured enough to merely report that they thought they were dead on account of "seeing an Angel" approach them. The Abyss is not the Cameron film that has captured the imaginations of the many over the years, but it enthralled me.

    James Cameron's first budget-buster, this underwater sci-fi thriller briefly spawned a swarm of rip-offs, just about all of them simply Alien clones set underwater. The Abyss is more in the vein of Close Encounters, though there's a strong whiff of Aliens in some scenes. Unlike those films, this one isn't trash. It's a serious, ambitious epic, with some awe-inspiring visuals. The Oscar-winning special effects are still a joy to behold. Production design is impressive. The score adds to the epic feel. As always with Cameron, we can expect intense, relentless set-pieces, and he doesn't disappoint, with a memorable opener, disaster hitting the undersea rig, and growing hostility between the protagonists, and an unstable Navy SEAL. And on top of that, the growing suspicion they're not alone down there... A truly impressive film, but it isn't quite up there with the best of Cameron's. Filming underwater scenes always presents pacing problems, and this film is no exception. There are many long-winded, sluggish moments that cause the film to drag at times. The anti-war anti-nuke sermonizing is stronger here than in the Terminator films, and is heavy-handed to the point that it couldn't be any less subtle if the heroes were all wearing peace symbols and No Nuke T-shirts. The cast are good enough, but at times performances verge on overly histrionic, especially at the climax with Lindsay - Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonion - talking to estranged hubbie Bud - Ed Harris - as he descends into the titular crevice to defuse a nuke. I don't think much of a spoiler to reveal the aliens are friendly, as the film more than signposted that in earlier scenes. This does however present a problem - whereas the aliens in Close Encounters didn't seem aware they were causing harm by snatching the boy, it seems conveniently forgotten all of a sudden that the aliens in The Abyss inadvertently caused the deaths of the entire crew of a missile submarine. The Special Edition is even longer, close to 3 hours, but it helps flesh characters out a bit more, and we see the aliens aren't entirely sweet-natured, as they come close to causing a terrible catastrophe to avert a possible conflict between the US and the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, the Cold War subplot of the Special Edition, means it hasn't dated as well storywise as the theatrical release. A flawed film to be sure, but a likable often impressive one.

The Abyss is a very character driven film, with all the characters being very distinct and memorial. I personally feared that some of the characters were going to only defined by their quirks or traits such as one of them being a conspiracy theorist and has a pet rat and other one is a woman in a cowboy hat and listens to country music, but the characters slowly get more fleshed out and likable as the film progress, particularly the relationship between Lindsey and Bud (Ed Harris). The team is as memorable as the Marines in Aliens, but there still leave an impression. Compared to most of Cameron's filmography, The Abyss is an action light film and more like a sci-fi film of old. As already mentioned that The Abyss does share similarities to The Thing because of its themes and basic settling (a group of highly trained personnel isolated in an extreme environment). At the end of the special edition The Abyss in the Special Edition also shares a lot of similarities to The Day the Earth Stood Still, with a little bit of 2010: The Year We Made Contact near the end and this is when Cameron goes on his soapbox about war and nuclear disarmament. For the time the special effects were incredible, using a combination of models and minitures and CGI. The water effects particularly hold up, especially when you still see water effect being very hard to do, like in The Last Airbender. The aliens too also had a unique design, looking like glowing stringrays with the pink, purple and blue lights and the aliens themselves had a mix of a classic grey alien look with more colour to them. Composer Alan Silverstri was also able to add to the visuals with an excellent score, using many different styles. There were heavy drums for the military to a softer choir when we see the aliens are present, giving them a divine presence. The Abyss is a long film and the Special Edition is over two and half hours and near the end the film The Abyss does start to drag. This is not helped when Cameron becomes more preachy and a little cheesy when Bud meets the aliens. The Abyss is a thoughtful, character driven sci-fi from Mr Cameron that reflects more older sci-fi films and shows that special effects should be used more then just for spectacle.

    I really do not usually do this but I was just watching this and I wanted to take a second and say this could easily be Ed Harris' best acting role, He is an amazing actor and it really shows and all this time I always said Needful things was his best, but Ill give it up to this one instead. Everyone is awesome in this film and its one I have always liked but it really moved me a little bit today and I wanted to say if you haven't watched it yet, you should. The film is amazing for being from the early 90's its really well done, No wonder Cameron is the best and has the best movies. This one really holds up for being 20 years old.

    James Cameron directs this ambitious, visually sumptuous but long adventure about a deep-sea oil rig crew who encounter mysterious occurrences that lead to the discovery of aliens, who are friendly, but who also want to be left alone it seems... Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio are compelling and believable as embattled employee/employer & husband/wife, who are at continual odds, but over the course of this story, become closer and closer, as both come close to death, and are also threatened by a crewman who goes crazy(Michael Bien) a plot point that goes on too long, as does this film, though it does come together eventually, there are some lulls in the pace of the film that hurt, but it is still worth watching, with spectacular end sequence(restored Director's Cut version).

    If you think about James Cameron movies, a film like "The Abyss" is not one that would pop into many people's brains. Maybe even less known than Cameron's film "True Lies", "The Abyss" is suspense at its best and further demonstrates Cameron's knack for story and characters in cinema. After a submarine is brought down to the depths by an unknown force that turns out to be alien, an underwater drilling base is usurped by the Navy team led by Lt. Coffey (Michael Biehn) to investigate the disaster. The people in charge of the drilling base, Bud (Ed Harris) and Lindsey (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), ex-spouses, work together to stop Coffey from destroying the alien species and rekindle their love. While "Avatar" is believed to be the most insightful film that portrays Cameron for an artist, I believe it is this film that does that. This film has a message beyond "Avatar's" businesses are greedy and want to take things from the weak. The message here is about being kind to one another and even though no one can be nice to everyone, it reminds you that being loving or nice to one person makes all the difference. This is one of the few films where I think it actually made me feel sad at the parts I was supposed to and happy at the parts I was supposed to, thanks to the brilliant acting by the whole cast and the powerful directing and writing that Cameron put into the story. "The Abyss" is a completely underrated work of art that has a better message and is able to succeed without all of the fancy effects and action scenes that Cameron is normally known for. Yes, this film has action but it deals more with the character drama alongside the struggle and not the drama being a subplot to the main struggle.

    The Abyss plays like a more extravagant, more mature and more interesting version of director James Cameron's 1984 breakout hit "The Terminator". Therein, we witness what is essentially a love story which happens to have an awful lot of general flak revolving around non-human entities and a range of supporting acts skewering proceedings playing out around it. There are special effects and a distinctly science fictitious atmosphere of fear of the unknown to proceedings, but nothing that matches neither the aggression of The Terminator nor the tendency to rely too heavily on B-movie convention. I don't think it would be at all untrue to label The Abyss as one of Cameron's best work. I view it a combination of the various traits that made up what the man was known for at this time in his career: we have the underwater set/ocean based narrative of Piranha II: The Spawning combining with that very claustrophobic atmosphere of Aliens, as something that's supernatural lurks out there ready for you, furthermore combining with that aforementioned idea of two people coming together under extraordinary circumstances before realising just how much they have in common while the exterior elements brood. Later on, the film even goes so far as to channel Paul Riser's character from Aliens when someone gets their own big ideas on how to deal with the newfound entity apparent in their company. The conflict in those three examples was, of course, much more obvious than it is here  a killer robot; a shoal of killer fish and a pack of killer extra-terrestrials, three things of which can only be so interesting for so long. The Abyss may be a slower and more patient film in its covering of events and depiction of character, but it at least has a little more to depict in the events column than mere second unit action. The film is additionally richer out of the fact its ambiguity and tendency to avoid straight up human heroes and non-human villains. Akin to Cameron's previous work, The Abyss covers a group of people in an inescapable situation made worse out of the fact they have to come to deal with a potentially non-human entity  a non-human entity whose first action during the opening sequence appeared to be to lure a submarine to its doom. The film is, despite this, so much more than how that sounds. Ed Harris leads a team of oil drillers whose expertise is in doing such a thing at great depths beneath the sea, a team of people recruited by the government to uncover precisely why it was that aforementioned submarine crashed and burned like it did. Although, one can hardly crash AND burn when one is underwater... The crew is distinguished by Harris' character Virgil Brigman and that of Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's Lindsey, two people who were once married but now maintain their professional relationship with one another in a working capacity. Also down there is a group of Navy SEALS, whose presence is that of protection should whatever caused the crash still be down there and still be dangerous. Lindsey is the lone female presence and Cameron plays with us in the manner he did when depicting one of the few feminine presences in his prior film Aliens. This occurs when one of the SEAL members asks Harris' character if she should be referred to as "sir", raising the issue of what's expected of specific genders in these sorts of projects: we have already witnessed hard-line female space marines who are as powerful as their male counterparts and a complete overhaul of the Sarah Connor character in The Terminator, whose passing from servant (waitress) to solider was there depicted. There is also a great deal of effectiveness in the way Cameron goes about depicting this newfound world the characters find themselves in. While we are a long way from both the inter-planetary colonies found in Aliens and the way in which Cameron attempts to make a parallel between the Los Angeles of 1984 (the setting for Terminator) and a god-forsaken post nuclear war Los Angeles of the 21st Century, the underwater setting here might just as well be somewhere futuristic and unreal for the feeling it evokes. There is a real vulnerability to the setting and its surroundings and as a tropical storm rages above on the surface severing communication with that which can only be defined as 'the outside world'. The film additionally toys with oxygen levels, deep-sea pressure and all the important apparatus required when one is this deep below the Earth's surface. There is a nasty, gooey feeling to these scenes such as there would be if one was in outer space and oxygen quantity in tow with levels of pressure were too vital. As far as dramas go, rarely does a film avoid a misstep like The Abyss does. The piece is, ultimately, the template for an adventure to allow for former romances to be rekindled while its attitude towards its premise that sees it resemble a deep-sea rescue/disaster film with a science fiction twist is the sort of Cameron genre hybridisation I can live with. One of the film's more crucial ideas revolves around when it is the entities make their presence known and to whom they appear. Many are the times wherein we watch as the character most prone to fits of hysterics is the one whose 'contact' is made first  thus, few are believers. Such is The Abyss' inherent maturity that when that happens here, it is not the character closest to psychological meltdown whose condition is abused for meek dramatics. Indeed, they are calm and measured enough to merely report that they thought they were dead on account of "seeing an Angel" approach them. The Abyss is not the Cameron film that has captured the imaginations of the many over the years, but it enthralled me.

    James Cameron's first budget-buster, this underwater sci-fi thriller briefly spawned a swarm of rip-offs, just about all of them simply Alien clones set underwater. The Abyss is more in the vein of Close Encounters, though there's a strong whiff of Aliens in some scenes. Unlike those films, this one isn't trash. It's a serious, ambitious epic, with some awe-inspiring visuals. The Oscar-winning special effects are still a joy to behold. Production design is impressive. The score adds to the epic feel. As always with Cameron, we can expect intense, relentless set-pieces, and he doesn't disappoint, with a memorable opener, disaster hitting the undersea rig, and growing hostility between the protagonists, and an unstable Navy SEAL. And on top of that, the growing suspicion they're not alone down there... A truly impressive film, but it isn't quite up there with the best of Cameron's. Filming underwater scenes always presents pacing problems, and this film is no exception. There are many long-winded, sluggish moments that cause the film to drag at times. The anti-war anti-nuke sermonizing is stronger here than in the Terminator films, and is heavy-handed to the point that it couldn't be any less subtle if the heroes were all wearing peace symbols and No Nuke T-shirts. The cast are good enough, but at times performances verge on overly histrionic, especially at the climax with Lindsay - Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonion - talking to estranged hubbie Bud - Ed Harris - as he descends into the titular crevice to defuse a nuke. I don't think much of a spoiler to reveal the aliens are friendly, as the film more than signposted that in earlier scenes. This does however present a problem - whereas the aliens in Close Encounters didn't seem aware they were causing harm by snatching the boy, it seems conveniently forgotten all of a sudden that the aliens in The Abyss inadvertently caused the deaths of the entire crew of a missile submarine. The Special Edition is even longer, close to 3 hours, but it helps flesh characters out a bit more, and we see the aliens aren't entirely sweet-natured, as they come close to causing a terrible catastrophe to avert a possible conflict between the US and the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, the Cold War subplot of the Special Edition, means it hasn't dated as well storywise as the theatrical release. A flawed film to be sure, but a likable often impressive one.

    This is a tough one. The movie holds you almost to the end in a gripping fight between good and evil. I don't want to give out any spoilers. So, I will be brief. Have you ever had a wonderful dinner at a restaurant and then they bring in a dessert, if you have room in your tummy, and it is a, let's say, beautiful, mouth-watering, delicious tasting creation. As you eat it, every bite causes you to pause to seal in your memory the sensation. Then, it breaks! You find a hair in your mouth, or worse yet, a fingernail! UGH!! Such repulsion. THAT is the sensation one gets when, after an edge-sitting, nail-biting movie, you come to the last 10 minutes or so and find you are have someone else's hair or nail in your mouth. Just note that Hollywood was really stupid to put their politically motivated morals which no terrorist or anti-American-of-old nation would ever consider. In fact, the ending was childish. The end.

    I like Cameron as a worker. I shudder when he makes what he thinks as art. The film helps explain a good deal, I think. It is in three layers, each one revealing of the man, his ethos, and a few cool things about filmmaking in general. The first layer is where a bunch of bureaucrat navy types decide on a course of action to avoid world destruction. This is where story-noise of our film is shaped, and everything we see of that story is dumb and mechanistic. Done by commission. Coincidence? The second layer is the first below water and Cameron's working space. We see a lot of rigs and hydraulic machinery here, the people are distinctly blue-collar types, the 'director' of the underwater enterprise has marital problems, as did Cameron at the time. Emphasis here is on getting a (cinematic) job done, which the film delivers with finely-tuned 'disaster movie' dynamics. A thrill ride as good as any part of Aliens. So far so good. Efficient but unspectacular. The third layer is deep in the abyss, where the 'director' takes a hopeless leap -sure to kill him- but instead is salvaged by miraculous creatures of the imagination, who supposedly have a city down there and quietly monitor humanity. Everything here amazes - deep , organic clarity in the architecture of both the arabesque city and alien creatures, the way the camera navigates by swimming inside, the textures of diaphanous light. The room where the meeting takes place and the creatures project mind-images on liquid screens is one of the most cinematic occasions I know. I cherish the film for just this scene. None of this is originally Cameron's though. It is by a man who probably changed sci-fi as much as Jules Verne, his name Moebius. You will know him chiefly through Alien and the BladeRunner, but his influence is more far-reaching than that. Now here's the problem with Cameron. The three layers have to be flattened so as to get resolutions, at least that's his plan. By nature of the thing, it's got to be settled above water, on the level of dumb story. Bad choice. Again, everything is on a huge scale. This has been a steady course of action for Cameron, since his days of rigging contraptions in Corman's movie factory. He was excellent in his work. With each success of these machines, their size got bigger, and as a result their narrative cogs grew bigger and bigger, and with so much success, so did Cameron's desire to 'educate' his audience with something constructive, since his machines were always geared for war and destruction. Like Spielberg, the more of destruction he shows, the more he feels compelled to stress out 'humane' aspects in his work. Individually, the imagery of the aliens averting nuclear war by threatening world destruction is spectacular, especially that of tsunamis arrested in their course - incidentally linking us back to the palpitating liquid walls of Moebius. But the resolution on that same grand scale is mechanically humane, pure contrivance. Cameron would grow in this direction, extending his engineer's reach from effects and machines to entire computer-generated environments, and pushing his desire to 'give back' and educate with a series of documentaries and epically hamfisted 'messages' in his films.

    The Abyss is a 1989 science fiction film, which can be characterized as an well made typical Hollywood blockbuster. If we could classify by genre, it would be a film in the underwater Alien encounter genre. It has many typical elements of a James Cameron film, such as a fairly cartoonish set of main and secondary characters and a typical love story. The film is the set in the "present day" (late 1980′s) when a nuclear submarine is intercepted and sunk by an unknown underwater object. A team of hard working divers is sent to investigate. Cameron said that he had the idea of the film's story since he was in high school, which was a story of a group of scientists working in a underwater laboratory. He changed to a group of commercial blue collar diving workers to increase the film's commercial appeal. This group of divers eventually discovers that it was a non-human intelligent lifeform that caused the accident. The special effects were the best in the world at the time the film was made, in the 1989, and they are among the main attraction of the film. The characters are also interesting, though they are a bit simple.

    The Abyss was a film that I heard a lot about on forums and saw plenty of ''if you like this, you may like...'' from Amazon, IMDb, Lovefilm, etc when looking at other films relating to the deep sea and sci-fi thrillers. So I thought I'll check it out. I found it quite entertaining for a while and interesting for the most parts. The characters were basic but understandable and you got to know the setting and situation they are in. The parts which drew you in the most were the scenes with the ''organisms'' (NTI's) flying around the base, it was mysterious and you were drawn closer as you become curious to know what they were. Much later in the film with the scene where Ed Harris jumps down into the trench to find the warhead, was when it started to get a bit absurd as he ventures into the extreme depths, but hey it's a sci-fi, so why complain right? It was actually gripping to see him go so deep. Although 5 minutes from that, the film took another route and that's when Cameron started waterboarding me with his typical ethics and morality vomit that his films are known for. I couldn't help but sulk at the end when we find out that the NTI's had been there the whole time and are going to flood all the land above due to humans destructive nature. The whole film right up to the scene where Ed Harris' character is communicating with the NTI's is a good movie, borderline great as it was entertaining, but when that scene started, it threw everything away which it had built. Suddenly I lost all interest and did not care. This film would have been an 8 from me, but due to Cameron failing to resist his classic urge to try and make the human race feel guilty, I had to sink it to a 6. Never the less, I still recommend this movie!

    James Cameron has made many great films over his career, including The Terminator, Terminator 2 and Aliens. But The Abyss is often forgotten when compared to his other films and was a box office flop when it was first released. An American Navy sub mysteriously sinks in the Cayman Trough at the height of the Cold War. With the American Navy unable to launch their own recuse operation they hire an oil drilling crew working on an experimental underwater oil platform. The US SEALs, the crew and the platform's designer, Lindsey Brigman (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) personalities start to clash underworld, with the SEALs' leader, Lt. Coffey (Michael Biehn) suffering from pressure madness, America and the Soviet Union moving closer to war and the potential discovery of alien life in the depths the ocean. The Abyss is a very tight, claustrophobic thriller which is very much about paranoid and distrust like The Thing and about the delicate state the world was in during the Cold War. The Abyss is a very character driven film, with all the characters being very distinct and memorial. I personally feared that some of the characters were going to only defined by their quirks or traits such as one of them being a conspiracy theorist and has a pet rat and other one is a woman in a cowboy hat and listens to country music, but the characters slowly get more fleshed out and likable as the film progress, particularly the relationship between Lindsey and Bud (Ed Harris). The team is as memorable as the Marines in Aliens, but there still leave an impression. Compared to most of Cameron's filmography, The Abyss is an action light film and more like a sci-fi film of old.

The crew is distinguished by Harris' character Virgil Brigman and that of Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's Lindsey, two people who were once married but now maintain their professional relationship with one another in a working capacity. Also down there is a group of Navy SEALS, whose presence is that of protection should whatever caused the crash still be down there and still be dangerous. Lindsey is the lone female presence and Cameron plays with us in the manner he did when depicting one of the few feminine presences in his prior film Aliens. This occurs when one of the SEAL members asks Harris' character if she should be referred to as "sir", raising the issue of what's expected of specific genders in these sorts of projects: we have already witnessed hard-line female space marines who are as powerful as their male counterparts and a complete overhaul of the Sarah Connor character in The Terminator, whose passing from servant (waitress) to solider was there depicted. There is also a great deal of effectiveness in the way Cameron goes about depicting this newfound world the characters find themselves in. While we are a long way from both the inter-planetary colonies found in Aliens and the way in which Cameron attempts to make a parallel between the Los Angeles of 1984 (the setting for Terminator) and a god-forsaken post nuclear war Los Angeles of the 21st Century, the underwater setting here might just as well be somewhere futuristic and unreal for the feeling it evokes. There is a real vulnerability to the setting and its surroundings and as a tropical storm rages above on the surface severing communication with that which can only be defined as 'the outside world'. The film additionally toys with oxygen levels, deep-sea pressure and all the important apparatus required when one is this deep below the Earth's surface. There is a nasty, gooey feeling to these scenes such as there would be if one was in outer space and oxygen quantity in tow with levels of pressure were too vital. As far as dramas go, rarely does a film avoid a misstep like The Abyss does. The piece is, ultimately, the template for an adventure to allow for former romances to be rekindled while its attitude towards its premise that sees it resemble a deep-sea rescue/disaster film with a science fiction twist is the sort of Cameron genre hybridisation I can live with. One of the film's more crucial ideas revolves around when it is the entities make their presence known and to whom they appear. Many are the times wherein we watch as the character most prone to fits of hysterics is the one whose 'contact' is made first  thus, few are believers. Such is The Abyss' inherent maturity that when that happens here, it is not the character closest to psychological meltdown whose condition is abused for meek dramatics. Indeed, they are calm and measured enough to merely report that they thought they were dead on account of "seeing an Angel" approach them. The Abyss is not the Cameron film that has captured the imaginations of the many over the years, but it enthralled me.

    James Cameron's first budget-buster, this underwater sci-fi thriller briefly spawned a swarm of rip-offs, just about all of them simply Alien clones set underwater. The Abyss is more in the vein of Close Encounters, though there's a strong whiff of Aliens in some scenes. Unlike those films, this one isn't trash. It's a serious, ambitious epic, with some awe-inspiring visuals. The Oscar-winning special effects are still a joy to behold. Production design is impressive. The score adds to the epic feel. As always with Cameron, we can expect intense, relentless set-pieces, and he doesn't disappoint, with a memorable opener, disaster hitting the undersea rig, and growing hostility between the protagonists, and an unstable Navy SEAL. And on top of that, the growing suspicion they're not alone down there... A truly impressive film, but it isn't quite up there with the best of Cameron's. Filming underwater scenes always presents pacing problems, and this film is no exception. There are many long-winded, sluggish moments that cause the film to drag at times. The anti-war anti-nuke sermonizing is stronger here than in the Terminator films, and is heavy-handed to the point that it couldn't be any less subtle if the heroes were all wearing peace symbols and No Nuke T-shirts. The cast are good enough, but at times performances verge on overly histrionic, especially at the climax with Lindsay - Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonion - talking to estranged hubbie Bud - Ed Harris - as he descends into the titular crevice to defuse a nuke. I don't think much of a spoiler to reveal the aliens are friendly, as the film more than signposted that in earlier scenes. This does however present a problem - whereas the aliens in Close Encounters didn't seem aware they were causing harm by snatching the boy, it seems conveniently forgotten all of a sudden that the aliens in The Abyss inadvertently caused the deaths of the entire crew of a missile submarine. The Special Edition is even longer, close to 3 hours, but it helps flesh characters out a bit more, and we see the aliens aren't entirely sweet-natured, as they come close to causing a terrible catastrophe to avert a possible conflict between the US and the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, the Cold War subplot of the Special Edition, means it hasn't dated as well storywise as the theatrical release. A flawed film to be sure, but a likable often impressive one.

    This is a tough one. The movie holds you almost to the end in a gripping fight between good and evil. I don't want to give out any spoilers. So, I will be brief. Have you ever had a wonderful dinner at a restaurant and then they bring in a dessert, if you have room in your tummy, and it is a, let's say, beautiful, mouth-watering, delicious tasting creation. As you eat it, every bite causes you to pause to seal in your memory the sensation. Then, it breaks! You find a hair in your mouth, or worse yet, a fingernail! UGH!! Such repulsion. THAT is the sensation one gets when, after an edge-sitting, nail-biting movie, you come to the last 10 minutes or so and find you are have someone else's hair or nail in your mouth. Just note that Hollywood was really stupid to put their politically motivated morals which no terrorist or anti-American-of-old nation would ever consider. In fact, the ending was childish. The end.

    I like Cameron as a worker. I shudder when he makes what he thinks as art. The film helps explain a good deal, I think. It is in three layers, each one revealing of the man, his ethos, and a few cool things about filmmaking in general. The first layer is where a bunch of bureaucrat navy types decide on a course of action to avoid world destruction. This is where story-noise of our film is shaped, and everything we see of that story is dumb and mechanistic. Done by commission. Coincidence? The second layer is the first below water and Cameron's working space. We see a lot of rigs and hydraulic machinery here, the people are distinctly blue-collar types, the 'director' of the underwater enterprise has marital problems, as did Cameron at the time. Emphasis here is on getting a (cinematic) job done, which the film delivers with finely-tuned 'disaster movie' dynamics. A thrill ride as good as any part of Aliens. So far so good. Efficient but unspectacular. The third layer is deep in the abyss, where the 'director' takes a hopeless leap -sure to kill him- but instead is salvaged by miraculous creatures of the imagination, who supposedly have a city down there and quietly monitor humanity. Everything here amazes - deep , organic clarity in the architecture of both the arabesque city and alien creatures, the way the camera navigates by swimming inside, the textures of diaphanous light. The room where the meeting takes place and the creatures project mind-images on liquid screens is one of the most cinematic occasions I know. I cherish the film for just this scene. None of this is originally Cameron's though. It is by a man who probably changed sci-fi as much as Jules Verne, his name Moebius. You will know him chiefly through Alien and the BladeRunner, but his influence is more far-reaching than that. Now here's the problem with Cameron. The three layers have to be flattened so as to get resolutions, at least that's his plan. By nature of the thing, it's got to be settled above water, on the level of dumb story. Bad choice. Again, everything is on a huge scale. This has been a steady course of action for Cameron, since his days of rigging contraptions in Corman's movie factory. He was excellent in his work. With each success of these machines, their size got bigger, and as a result their narrative cogs grew bigger and bigger, and with so much success, so did Cameron's desire to 'educate' his audience with something constructive, since his machines were always geared for war and destruction. Like Spielberg, the more of destruction he shows, the more he feels compelled to stress out 'humane' aspects in his work. Individually, the imagery of the aliens averting nuclear war by threatening world destruction is spectacular, especially that of tsunamis arrested in their course - incidentally linking us back to the palpitating liquid walls of Moebius. But the resolution on that same grand scale is mechanically humane, pure contrivance. Cameron would grow in this direction, extending his engineer's reach from effects and machines to entire computer-generated environments, and pushing his desire to 'give back' and educate with a series of documentaries and epically hamfisted 'messages' in his films.

    The Abyss is a 1989 science fiction film, which can be characterized as an well made typical Hollywood blockbuster. If we could classify by genre, it would be a film in the underwater Alien encounter genre. It has many typical elements of a James Cameron film, such as a fairly cartoonish set of main and secondary characters and a typical love story. The film is the set in the "present day" (late 1980′s) when a nuclear submarine is intercepted and sunk by an unknown underwater object. A team of hard working divers is sent to investigate. Cameron said that he had the idea of the film's story since he was in high school, which was a story of a group of scientists working in a underwater laboratory. He changed to a group of commercial blue collar diving workers to increase the film's commercial appeal. This group of divers eventually discovers that it was a non-human intelligent lifeform that caused the accident. The special effects were the best in the world at the time the film was made, in the 1989, and they are among the main attraction of the film. The characters are also interesting, though they are a bit simple.

    The Abyss was a film that I heard a lot about on forums and saw plenty of ''if you like this, you may like...'' from Amazon, IMDb, Lovefilm, etc when looking at other films relating to the deep sea and sci-fi thrillers. So I thought I'll check it out. I found it quite entertaining for a while and interesting for the most parts. The characters were basic but understandable and you got to know the setting and situation they are in. The parts which drew you in the most were the scenes with the ''organisms'' (NTI's) flying around the base, it was mysterious and you were drawn closer as you become curious to know what they were. Much later in the film with the scene where Ed Harris jumps down into the trench to find the warhead, was when it started to get a bit absurd as he ventures into the extreme depths, but hey it's a sci-fi, so why complain right? It was actually gripping to see him go so deep. Although 5 minutes from that, the film took another route and that's when Cameron started waterboarding me with his typical ethics and morality vomit that his films are known for. I couldn't help but sulk at the end when we find out that the NTI's had been there the whole time and are going to flood all the land above due to humans destructive nature. The whole film right up to the scene where Ed Harris' character is communicating with the NTI's is a good movie, borderline great as it was entertaining, but when that scene started, it threw everything away which it had built. Suddenly I lost all interest and did not care. This film would have been an 8 from me, but due to Cameron failing to resist his classic urge to try and make the human race feel guilty, I had to sink it to a 6. Never the less, I still recommend this movie!

    James Cameron has made many great films over his career, including The Terminator, Terminator 2 and Aliens. But The Abyss is often forgotten when compared to his other films and was a box office flop when it was first released. An American Navy sub mysteriously sinks in the Cayman Trough at the height of the Cold War. With the American Navy unable to launch their own recuse operation they hire an oil drilling crew working on an experimental underwater oil platform. The US SEALs, the crew and the platform's designer, Lindsey Brigman (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) personalities start to clash underworld, with the SEALs' leader, Lt. Coffey (Michael Biehn) suffering from pressure madness, America and the Soviet Union moving closer to war and the potential discovery of alien life in the depths the ocean. The Abyss is a very tight, claustrophobic thriller which is very much about paranoid and distrust like The Thing and about the delicate state the world was in during the Cold War. The Abyss is a very character driven film, with all the characters being very distinct and memorial. I personally feared that some of the characters were going to only defined by their quirks or traits such as one of them being a conspiracy theorist and has a pet rat and other one is a woman in a cowboy hat and listens to country music, but the characters slowly get more fleshed out and likable as the film progress, particularly the relationship between Lindsey and Bud (Ed Harris). The team is as memorable as the Marines in Aliens, but there still leave an impression. Compared to most of Cameron's filmography, The Abyss is an action light film and more like a sci-fi film of old. As already mentioned that The Abyss does share similarities to The Thing because of its themes and basic settling (a group of highly trained personnel isolated in an extreme environment). At the end of the special edition The Abyss in the Special Edition also shares a lot of similarities to The Day the Earth Stood Still, with a little bit of 2010: The Year We Made Contact near the end and this is when Cameron goes on his soapbox about war and nuclear disarmament. For the time the special effects were incredible, using a combination of models and minitures and CGI. The water effects particularly hold up, especially when you still see water effect being very hard to do, like in The Last Airbender. The aliens too also had a unique design, looking like glowing stringrays with the pink, purple and blue lights and the aliens themselves had a mix of a classic grey alien look with more colour to them. Composer Alan Silverstri was also able to add to the visuals with an excellent score, using many different styles. There were heavy drums for the military to a softer choir when we see the aliens are present, giving them a divine presence. The Abyss is a long film and the Special Edition is over two and half hours and near the end the film The Abyss does start to drag. This is not helped when Cameron becomes more preachy and a little cheesy when Bud meets the aliens. The Abyss is a thoughtful, character driven sci-fi from Mr Cameron that reflects more older sci-fi films and shows that special effects should be used more then just for spectacle.

    I really do not usually do this but I was just watching this and I wanted to take a second and say this could easily be Ed Harris' best acting role, He is an amazing actor and it really shows and all this time I always said Needful things was his best, but Ill give it up to this one instead. Everyone is awesome in this film and its one I have always liked but it really moved me a little bit today and I wanted to say if you haven't watched it yet, you should. The film is amazing for being from the early 90's its really well done, No wonder Cameron is the best and has the best movies. This one really holds up for being 20 years old.

    James Cameron directs this ambitious, visually sumptuous but long adventure about a deep-sea oil rig crew who encounter mysterious occurrences that lead to the discovery of aliens, who are friendly, but who also want to be left alone it seems... Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio are compelling and believable as embattled employee/employer & husband/wife, who are at continual odds, but over the course of this story, become closer and closer, as both come close to death, and are also threatened by a crewman who goes crazy(Michael Bien) a plot point that goes on too long, as does this film, though it does come together eventually, there are some lulls in the pace of the film that hurt, but it is still worth watching, with spectacular end sequence(restored Director's Cut version).

    If you think about James Cameron movies, a film like "The Abyss" is not one that would pop into many people's brains. Maybe even less known than Cameron's film "True Lies", "The Abyss" is suspense at its best and further demonstrates Cameron's knack for story and characters in cinema. After a submarine is brought down to the depths by an unknown force that turns out to be alien, an underwater drilling base is usurped by the Navy team led by Lt. Coffey (Michael Biehn) to investigate the disaster. The people in charge of the drilling base, Bud (Ed Harris) and Lindsey (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), ex-spouses, work together to stop Coffey from destroying the alien species and rekindle their love. While "Avatar" is believed to be the most insightful film that portrays Cameron for an artist, I believe it is this film that does that. This film has a message beyond "Avatar's" businesses are greedy and want to take things from the weak. The message here is about being kind to one another and even though no one can be nice to everyone, it reminds you that being loving or nice to one person makes all the difference. This is one of the few films where I think it actually made me feel sad at the parts I was supposed to and happy at the parts I was supposed to, thanks to the brilliant acting by the whole cast and the powerful directing and writing that Cameron put into the story. "The Abyss" is a completely underrated work of art that has a better message and is able to succeed without all of the fancy effects and action scenes that Cameron is normally known for. Yes, this film has action but it deals more with the character drama alongside the struggle and not the drama being a subplot to the main struggle.

    The Abyss plays like a more extravagant, more mature and more interesting version of director James Cameron's 1984 breakout hit "The Terminator". Therein, we witness what is essentially a love story which happens to have an awful lot of general flak revolving around non-human entities and a range of supporting acts skewering proceedings playing out around it. There are special effects and a distinctly science fictitious atmosphere of fear of the unknown to proceedings, but nothing that matches neither the aggression of The Terminator nor the tendency to rely too heavily on B-movie convention. I don't think it would be at all untrue to label The Abyss as one of Cameron's best work. I view it a combination of the various traits that made up what the man was known for at this time in his career: we have the underwater set/ocean based narrative of Piranha II: The Spawning combining with that very claustrophobic atmosphere of Aliens, as something that's supernatural lurks out there ready for you, furthermore combining with that aforementioned idea of two people coming together under extraordinary circumstances before realising just how much they have in common while the exterior elements brood. Later on, the film even goes so far as to channel Paul Riser's character from Aliens when someone gets their own big ideas on how to deal with the newfound entity apparent in their company. The conflict in those three examples was, of course, much more obvious than it is here  a killer robot; a shoal of killer fish and a pack of killer extra-terrestrials, three things of which can only be so interesting for so long. The Abyss may be a slower and more patient film in its covering of events and depiction of character, but it at least has a little more to depict in the events column than mere second unit action. The film is additionally richer out of the fact its ambiguity and tendency to avoid straight up human heroes and non-human villains. Akin to Cameron's previous work, The Abyss covers a group of people in an inescapable situation made worse out of the fact they have to come to deal with a potentially non-human entity  a non-human entity whose first action during the opening sequence appeared to be to lure a submarine to its doom. The film is, despite this, so much more than how that sounds. Ed Harris leads a team of oil drillers whose expertise is in doing such a thing at great depths beneath the sea, a team of people recruited by the government to uncover precisely why it was that aforementioned submarine crashed and burned like it did. Although, one can hardly crash AND burn when one is underwater... The crew is distinguished by Harris' character Virgil Brigman and that of Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's Lindsey, two people who were once married but now maintain their professional relationship with one another in a working capacity. Also down there is a group of Navy SEALS, whose presence is that of protection should whatever caused the crash still be down there and still be dangerous. Lindsey is the lone female presence and Cameron plays with us in the manner he did when depicting one of the few feminine presences in his prior film Aliens. This occurs when one of the SEAL members asks Harris' character if she should be referred to as "sir", raising the issue of what's expected of specific genders in these sorts of projects: we have already witnessed hard-line female space marines who are as powerful as their male counterparts and a complete overhaul of the Sarah Connor character in The Terminator, whose passing from servant (waitress) to solider was there depicted. There is also a great deal of effectiveness in the way Cameron goes about depicting this newfound world the characters find themselves in. While we are a long way from both the inter-planetary colonies found in Aliens and the way in which Cameron attempts to make a parallel between the Los Angeles of 1984 (the setting for Terminator) and a god-forsaken post nuclear war Los Angeles of the 21st Century, the underwater setting here might just as well be somewhere futuristic and unreal for the feeling it evokes. There is a real vulnerability to the setting and its surroundings and as a tropical storm rages above on the surface severing communication with that which can only be defined as 'the outside world'. The film additionally toys with oxygen levels, deep-sea pressure and all the important apparatus required when one is this deep below the Earth's surface. There is a nasty, gooey feeling to these scenes such as there would be if one was in outer space and oxygen quantity in tow with levels of pressure were too vital.

Again, everything is on a huge scale. This has been a steady course of action for Cameron, since his days of rigging contraptions in Corman's movie factory. He was excellent in his work. With each success of these machines, their size got bigger, and as a result their narrative cogs grew bigger and bigger, and with so much success, so did Cameron's desire to 'educate' his audience with something constructive, since his machines were always geared for war and destruction. Like Spielberg, the more of destruction he shows, the more he feels compelled to stress out 'humane' aspects in his work. Individually, the imagery of the aliens averting nuclear war by threatening world destruction is spectacular, especially that of tsunamis arrested in their course - incidentally linking us back to the palpitating liquid walls of Moebius. But the resolution on that same grand scale is mechanically humane, pure contrivance. Cameron would grow in this direction, extending his engineer's reach from effects and machines to entire computer-generated environments, and pushing his desire to 'give back' and educate with a series of documentaries and epically hamfisted 'messages' in his films.

    The Abyss is a 1989 science fiction film, which can be characterized as an well made typical Hollywood blockbuster. If we could classify by genre, it would be a film in the underwater Alien encounter genre. It has many typical elements of a James Cameron film, such as a fairly cartoonish set of main and secondary characters and a typical love story. The film is the set in the "present day" (late 1980′s) when a nuclear submarine is intercepted and sunk by an unknown underwater object. A team of hard working divers is sent to investigate. Cameron said that he had the idea of the film's story since he was in high school, which was a story of a group of scientists working in a underwater laboratory. He changed to a group of commercial blue collar diving workers to increase the film's commercial appeal. This group of divers eventually discovers that it was a non-human intelligent lifeform that caused the accident. The special effects were the best in the world at the time the film was made, in the 1989, and they are among the main attraction of the film. The characters are also interesting, though they are a bit simple.

    The Abyss was a film that I heard a lot about on forums and saw plenty of ''if you like this, you may like...'' from Amazon, IMDb, Lovefilm, etc when looking at other films relating to the deep sea and sci-fi thrillers. So I thought I'll check it out. I found it quite entertaining for a while and interesting for the most parts. The characters were basic but understandable and you got to know the setting and situation they are in. The parts which drew you in the most were the scenes with the ''organisms'' (NTI's) flying around the base, it was mysterious and you were drawn closer as you become curious to know what they were. Much later in the film with the scene where Ed Harris jumps down into the trench to find the warhead, was when it started to get a bit absurd as he ventures into the extreme depths, but hey it's a sci-fi, so why complain right? It was actually gripping to see him go so deep. Although 5 minutes from that, the film took another route and that's when Cameron started waterboarding me with his typical ethics and morality vomit that his films are known for. I couldn't help but sulk at the end when we find out that the NTI's had been there the whole time and are going to flood all the land above due to humans destructive nature. The whole film right up to the scene where Ed Harris' character is communicating with the NTI's is a good movie, borderline great as it was entertaining, but when that scene started, it threw everything away which it had built. Suddenly I lost all interest and did not care. This film would have been an 8 from me, but due to Cameron failing to resist his classic urge to try and make the human race feel guilty, I had to sink it to a 6. Never the less, I still recommend this movie!

    James Cameron has made many great films over his career, including The Terminator, Terminator 2 and Aliens. But The Abyss is often forgotten when compared to his other films and was a box office flop when it was first released. An American Navy sub mysteriously sinks in the Cayman Trough at the height of the Cold War. With the American Navy unable to launch their own recuse operation they hire an oil drilling crew working on an experimental underwater oil platform. The US SEALs, the crew and the platform's designer, Lindsey Brigman (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) personalities start to clash underworld, with the SEALs' leader, Lt. Coffey (Michael Biehn) suffering from pressure madness, America and the Soviet Union moving closer to war and the potential discovery of alien life in the depths the ocean. The Abyss is a very tight, claustrophobic thriller which is very much about paranoid and distrust like The Thing and about the delicate state the world was in during the Cold War. The Abyss is a very character driven film, with all the characters being very distinct and memorial. I personally feared that some of the characters were going to only defined by their quirks or traits such as one of them being a conspiracy theorist and has a pet rat and other one is a woman in a cowboy hat and listens to country music, but the characters slowly get more fleshed out and likable as the film progress, particularly the relationship between Lindsey and Bud (Ed Harris). The team is as memorable as the Marines in Aliens, but there still leave an impression. Compared to most of Cameron's filmography, The Abyss is an action light film and more like a sci-fi film of old. As already mentioned that The Abyss does share similarities to The Thing because of its themes and basic settling (a group of highly trained personnel isolated in an extreme environment). At the end of the special edition The Abyss in the Special Edition also shares a lot of similarities to The Day the Earth Stood Still, with a little bit of 2010: The Year We Made Contact near the end and this is when Cameron goes on his soapbox about war and nuclear disarmament. For the time the special effects were incredible, using a combination of models and minitures and CGI. The water effects particularly hold up, especially when you still see water effect being very hard to do, like in The Last Airbender. The aliens too also had a unique design, looking like glowing stringrays with the pink, purple and blue lights and the aliens themselves had a mix of a classic grey alien look with more colour to them. Composer Alan Silverstri was also able to add to the visuals with an excellent score, using many different styles. There were heavy drums for the military to a softer choir when we see the aliens are present, giving them a divine presence. The Abyss is a long film and the Special Edition is over two and half hours and near the end the film The Abyss does start to drag. This is not helped when Cameron becomes more preachy and a little cheesy when Bud meets the aliens. The Abyss is a thoughtful, character driven sci-fi from Mr Cameron that reflects more older sci-fi films and shows that special effects should be used more then just for spectacle.

    I really do not usually do this but I was just watching this and I wanted to take a second and say this could easily be Ed Harris' best acting role, He is an amazing actor and it really shows and all this time I always said Needful things was his best, but Ill give it up to this one instead. Everyone is awesome in this film and its one I have always liked but it really moved me a little bit today and I wanted to say if you haven't watched it yet, you should. The film is amazing for being from the early 90's its really well done, No wonder Cameron is the best and has the best movies. This one really holds up for being 20 years old.

    James Cameron directs this ambitious, visually sumptuous but long adventure about a deep-sea oil rig crew who encounter mysterious occurrences that lead to the discovery of aliens, who are friendly, but who also want to be left alone it seems... Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio are compelling and believable as embattled employee/employer & husband/wife, who are at continual odds, but over the course of this story, become closer and closer, as both come close to death, and are also threatened by a crewman who goes crazy(Michael Bien) a plot point that goes on too long, as does this film, though it does come together eventually, there are some lulls in the pace of the film that hurt, but it is still worth watching, with spectacular end sequence(restored Director's Cut version).

    If you think about James Cameron movies, a film like "The Abyss" is not one that would pop into many people's brains. Maybe even less known than Cameron's film "True Lies", "The Abyss" is suspense at its best and further demonstrates Cameron's knack for story and characters in cinema. After a submarine is brought down to the depths by an unknown force that turns out to be alien, an underwater drilling base is usurped by the Navy team led by Lt. Coffey (Michael Biehn) to investigate the disaster. The people in charge of the drilling base, Bud (Ed Harris) and Lindsey (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), ex-spouses, work together to stop Coffey from destroying the alien species and rekindle their love. While "Avatar" is believed to be the most insightful film that portrays Cameron for an artist, I believe it is this film that does that. This film has a message beyond "Avatar's" businesses are greedy and want to take things from the weak. The message here is about being kind to one another and even though no one can be nice to everyone, it reminds you that being loving or nice to one person makes all the difference. This is one of the few films where I think it actually made me feel sad at the parts I was supposed to and happy at the parts I was supposed to, thanks to the brilliant acting by the whole cast and the powerful directing and writing that Cameron put into the story. "The Abyss" is a completely underrated work of art that has a better message and is able to succeed without all of the fancy effects and action scenes that Cameron is normally known for. Yes, this film has action but it deals more with the character drama alongside the struggle and not the drama being a subplot to the main struggle.

    The Abyss plays like a more extravagant, more mature and more interesting version of director James Cameron's 1984 breakout hit "The Terminator". Therein, we witness what is essentially a love story which happens to have an awful lot of general flak revolving around non-human entities and a range of supporting acts skewering proceedings playing out around it. There are special effects and a distinctly science fictitious atmosphere of fear of the unknown to proceedings, but nothing that matches neither the aggression of The Terminator nor the tendency to rely too heavily on B-movie convention. I don't think it would be at all untrue to label The Abyss as one of Cameron's best work. I view it a combination of the various traits that made up what the man was known for at this time in his career: we have the underwater set/ocean based narrative of Piranha II: The Spawning combining with that very claustrophobic atmosphere of Aliens, as something that's supernatural lurks out there ready for you, furthermore combining with that aforementioned idea of two people coming together under extraordinary circumstances before realising just how much they have in common while the exterior elements brood. Later on, the film even goes so far as to channel Paul Riser's character from Aliens when someone gets their own big ideas on how to deal with the newfound entity apparent in their company. The conflict in those three examples was, of course, much more obvious than it is here  a killer robot; a shoal of killer fish and a pack of killer extra-terrestrials, three things of which can only be so interesting for so long. The Abyss may be a slower and more patient film in its covering of events and depiction of character, but it at least has a little more to depict in the events column than mere second unit action. The film is additionally richer out of the fact its ambiguity and tendency to avoid straight up human heroes and non-human villains. Akin to Cameron's previous work, The Abyss covers a group of people in an inescapable situation made worse out of the fact they have to come to deal with a potentially non-human entity  a non-human entity whose first action during the opening sequence appeared to be to lure a submarine to its doom. The film is, despite this, so much more than how that sounds. Ed Harris leads a team of oil drillers whose expertise is in doing such a thing at great depths beneath the sea, a team of people recruited by the government to uncover precisely why it was that aforementioned submarine crashed and burned like it did. Although, one can hardly crash AND burn when one is underwater... The crew is distinguished by Harris' character Virgil Brigman and that of Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's Lindsey, two people who were once married but now maintain their professional relationship with one another in a working capacity. Also down there is a group of Navy SEALS, whose presence is that of protection should whatever caused the crash still be down there and still be dangerous. Lindsey is the lone female presence and Cameron plays with us in the manner he did when depicting one of the few feminine presences in his prior film Aliens. This occurs when one of the SEAL members asks Harris' character if she should be referred to as "sir", raising the issue of what's expected of specific genders in these sorts of projects: we have already witnessed hard-line female space marines who are as powerful as their male counterparts and a complete overhaul of the Sarah Connor character in The Terminator, whose passing from servant (waitress) to solider was there depicted. There is also a great deal of effectiveness in the way Cameron goes about depicting this newfound world the characters find themselves in. While we are a long way from both the inter-planetary colonies found in Aliens and the way in which Cameron attempts to make a parallel between the Los Angeles of 1984 (the setting for Terminator) and a god-forsaken post nuclear war Los Angeles of the 21st Century, the underwater setting here might just as well be somewhere futuristic and unreal for the feeling it evokes. There is a real vulnerability to the setting and its surroundings and as a tropical storm rages above on the surface severing communication with that which can only be defined as 'the outside world'. The film additionally toys with oxygen levels, deep-sea pressure and all the important apparatus required when one is this deep below the Earth's surface. There is a nasty, gooey feeling to these scenes such as there would be if one was in outer space and oxygen quantity in tow with levels of pressure were too vital. As far as dramas go, rarely does a film avoid a misstep like The Abyss does. The piece is, ultimately, the template for an adventure to allow for former romances to be rekindled while its attitude towards its premise that sees it resemble a deep-sea rescue/disaster film with a science fiction twist is the sort of Cameron genre hybridisation I can live with. One of the film's more crucial ideas revolves around when it is the entities make their presence known and to whom they appear. Many are the times wherein we watch as the character most prone to fits of hysterics is the one whose 'contact' is made first  thus, few are believers. Such is The Abyss' inherent maturity that when that happens here, it is not the character closest to psychological meltdown whose condition is abused for meek dramatics. Indeed, they are calm and measured enough to merely report that they thought they were dead on account of "seeing an Angel" approach them. The Abyss is not the Cameron film that has captured the imaginations of the many over the years, but it enthralled me.

    James Cameron's first budget-buster, this underwater sci-fi thriller briefly spawned a swarm of rip-offs, just about all of them simply Alien clones set underwater. The Abyss is more in the vein of Close Encounters, though there's a strong whiff of Aliens in some scenes. Unlike those films, this one isn't trash. It's a serious, ambitious epic, with some awe-inspiring visuals. The Oscar-winning special effects are still a joy to behold. Production design is impressive. The score adds to the epic feel. As always with Cameron, we can expect intense, relentless set-pieces, and he doesn't disappoint, with a memorable opener, disaster hitting the undersea rig, and growing hostility between the protagonists, and an unstable Navy SEAL. And on top of that, the growing suspicion they're not alone down there... A truly impressive film, but it isn't quite up there with the best of Cameron's. Filming underwater scenes always presents pacing problems, and this film is no exception. There are many long-winded, sluggish moments that cause the film to drag at times. The anti-war anti-nuke sermonizing is stronger here than in the Terminator films, and is heavy-handed to the point that it couldn't be any less subtle if the heroes were all wearing peace symbols and No Nuke T-shirts. The cast are good enough, but at times performances verge on overly histrionic, especially at the climax with Lindsay - Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonion - talking to estranged hubbie Bud - Ed Harris - as he descends into the titular crevice to defuse a nuke. I don't think much of a spoiler to reveal the aliens are friendly, as the film more than signposted that in earlier scenes. This does however present a problem - whereas the aliens in Close Encounters didn't seem aware they were causing harm by snatching the boy, it seems conveniently forgotten all of a sudden that the aliens in The Abyss inadvertently caused the deaths of the entire crew of a missile submarine. The Special Edition is even longer, close to 3 hours, but it helps flesh characters out a bit more, and we see the aliens aren't entirely sweet-natured, as they come close to causing a terrible catastrophe to avert a possible conflict between the US and the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, the Cold War subplot of the Special Edition, means it hasn't dated as well storywise as the theatrical release. A flawed film to be sure, but a likable often impressive one.

    This is a tough one. The movie holds you almost to the end in a gripping fight between good and evil. I don't want to give out any spoilers. So, I will be brief. Have you ever had a wonderful dinner at a restaurant and then they bring in a dessert, if you have room in your tummy, and it is a, let's say, beautiful, mouth-watering, delicious tasting creation. As you eat it, every bite causes you to pause to seal in your memory the sensation. Then, it breaks! You find a hair in your mouth, or worse yet, a fingernail! UGH!! Such repulsion. THAT is the sensation one gets when, after an edge-sitting, nail-biting movie, you come to the last 10 minutes or so and find you are have someone else's hair or nail in your mouth. Just note that Hollywood was really stupid to put their politically motivated morals which no terrorist or anti-American-of-old nation would ever consider. In fact, the ending was childish. The end.

    I like Cameron as a worker. I shudder when he makes what he thinks as art. The film helps explain a good deal, I think. It is in three layers, each one revealing of the man, his ethos, and a few cool things about filmmaking in general. The first layer is where a bunch of bureaucrat navy types decide on a course of action to avoid world destruction. This is where story-noise of our film is shaped, and everything we see of that story is dumb and mechanistic. Done by commission. Coincidence? The second layer is the first below water and Cameron's working space. We see a lot of rigs and hydraulic machinery here, the people are distinctly blue-collar types, the 'director' of the underwater enterprise has marital problems, as did Cameron at the time. Emphasis here is on getting a (cinematic) job done, which the film delivers with finely-tuned 'disaster movie' dynamics. A thrill ride as good as any part of Aliens. So far so good. Efficient but unspectacular. The third layer is deep in the abyss, where the 'director' takes a hopeless leap -sure to kill him- but instead is salvaged by miraculous creatures of the imagination, who supposedly have a city down there and quietly monitor humanity. Everything here amazes - deep , organic clarity in the architecture of both the arabesque city and alien creatures, the way the camera navigates by swimming inside, the textures of diaphanous light. The room where the meeting takes place and the creatures project mind-images on liquid screens is one of the most cinematic occasions I know. I cherish the film for just this scene. None of this is originally Cameron's though. It is by a man who probably changed sci-fi as much as Jules Verne, his name Moebius. You will know him chiefly through Alien and the BladeRunner, but his influence is more far-reaching than that. Now here's the problem with Cameron. The three layers have to be flattened so as to get resolutions, at least that's his plan. By nature of the thing, it's got to be settled above water, on the level of dumb story. Bad choice. Again, everything is on a huge scale. This has been a steady course of action for Cameron, since his days of rigging contraptions in Corman's movie factory. He was excellent in his work. With each success of these machines, their size got bigger, and as a result their narrative cogs grew bigger and bigger, and with so much success, so did Cameron's desire to 'educate' his audience with something constructive, since his machines were always geared for war and destruction. Like Spielberg, the more of destruction he shows, the more he feels compelled to stress out 'humane' aspects in his work. Individually, the imagery of the aliens averting nuclear war by threatening world destruction is spectacular, especially that of tsunamis arrested in their course - incidentally linking us back to the palpitating liquid walls of Moebius. But the resolution on that same grand scale is mechanically humane, pure contrivance. Cameron would grow in this direction, extending his engineer's reach from effects and machines to entire computer-generated environments, and pushing his desire to 'give back' and educate with a series of documentaries and epically hamfisted 'messages' in his films.

    James Cameron directs this ambitious, visually sumptuous but long adventure about a deep-sea oil rig crew who encounter mysterious occurrences that lead to the discovery of aliens, who are friendly, but who also want to be left alone it seems... Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio are compelling and believable as embattled employee/employer & husband/wife, who are at continual odds, but over the course of this story, become closer and closer, as both come close to death, and are also threatened by a crewman who goes crazy(Michael Bien) a plot point that goes on too long, as does this film, though it does come together eventually, there are some lulls in the pace of the film that hurt, but it is still worth watching, with spectacular end sequence(restored Director's Cut version).

    If you think about James Cameron movies, a film like "The Abyss" is not one that would pop into many people's brains. Maybe even less known than Cameron's film "True Lies", "The Abyss" is suspense at its best and further demonstrates Cameron's knack for story and characters in cinema. After a submarine is brought down to the depths by an unknown force that turns out to be alien, an underwater drilling base is usurped by the Navy team led by Lt. Coffey (Michael Biehn) to investigate the disaster. The people in charge of the drilling base, Bud (Ed Harris) and Lindsey (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), ex-spouses, work together to stop Coffey from destroying the alien species and rekindle their love. While "Avatar" is believed to be the most insightful film that portrays Cameron for an artist, I believe it is this film that does that. This film has a message beyond "Avatar's" businesses are greedy and want to take things from the weak. The message here is about being kind to one another and even though no one can be nice to everyone, it reminds you that being loving or nice to one person makes all the difference. This is one of the few films where I think it actually made me feel sad at the parts I was supposed to and happy at the parts I was supposed to, thanks to the brilliant acting by the whole cast and the powerful directing and writing that Cameron put into the story. "The Abyss" is a completely underrated work of art that has a better message and is able to succeed without all of the fancy effects and action scenes that Cameron is normally known for. Yes, this film has action but it deals more with the character drama alongside the struggle and not the drama being a subplot to the main struggle.

    The Abyss plays like a more extravagant, more mature and more interesting version of director James Cameron's 1984 breakout hit "The Terminator". Therein, we witness what is essentially a love story which happens to have an awful lot of general flak revolving around non-human entities and a range of supporting acts skewering proceedings playing out around it. There are special effects and a distinctly science fictitious atmosphere of fear of the unknown to proceedings, but nothing that matches neither the aggression of The Terminator nor the tendency to rely too heavily on B-movie convention. I don't think it would be at all untrue to label The Abyss as one of Cameron's best work. I view it a combination of the various traits that made up what the man was known for at this time in his career: we have the underwater set/ocean based narrative of Piranha II: The Spawning combining with that very claustrophobic atmosphere of Aliens, as something that's supernatural lurks out there ready for you, furthermore combining with that aforementioned idea of two people coming together under extraordinary circumstances before realising just how much they have in common while the exterior elements brood. Later on, the film even goes so far as to channel Paul Riser's character from Aliens when someone gets their own big ideas on how to deal with the newfound entity apparent in their company. The conflict in those three examples was, of course, much more obvious than it is here  a killer robot; a shoal of killer fish and a pack of killer extra-terrestrials, three things of which can only be so interesting for so long. The Abyss may be a slower and more patient film in its covering of events and depiction of character, but it at least has a little more to depict in the events column than mere second unit action. The film is additionally richer out of the fact its ambiguity and tendency to avoid straight up human heroes and non-human villains. Akin to Cameron's previous work, The Abyss covers a group of people in an inescapable situation made worse out of the fact they have to come to deal with a potentially non-human entity  a non-human entity whose first action during the opening sequence appeared to be to lure a submarine to its doom. The film is, despite this, so much more than how that sounds. Ed Harris leads a team of oil drillers whose expertise is in doing such a thing at great depths beneath the sea, a team of people recruited by the government to uncover precisely why it was that aforementioned submarine crashed and burned like it did. Although, one can hardly crash AND burn when one is underwater... The crew is distinguished by Harris' character Virgil Brigman and that of Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's Lindsey, two people who were once married but now maintain their professional relationship with one another in a working capacity. Also down there is a group of Navy SEALS, whose presence is that of protection should whatever caused the crash still be down there and still be dangerous. Lindsey is the lone female presence and Cameron plays with us in the manner he did when depicting one of the few feminine presences in his prior film Aliens. This occurs when one of the SEAL members asks Harris' character if she should be referred to as "sir", raising the issue of what's expected of specific genders in these sorts of projects: we have already witnessed hard-line female space marines who are as powerful as their male counterparts and a complete overhaul of the Sarah Connor character in The Terminator, whose passing from servant (waitress) to solider was there depicted. There is also a great deal of effectiveness in the way Cameron goes about depicting this newfound world the characters find themselves in. While we are a long way from both the inter-planetary colonies found in Aliens and the way in which Cameron attempts to make a parallel between the Los Angeles of 1984 (the setting for Terminator) and a god-forsaken post nuclear war Los Angeles of the 21st Century, the underwater setting here might just as well be somewhere futuristic and unreal for the feeling it evokes. There is a real vulnerability to the setting and its surroundings and as a tropical storm rages above on the surface severing communication with that which can only be defined as 'the outside world'. The film additionally toys with oxygen levels, deep-sea pressure and all the important apparatus required when one is this deep below the Earth's surface. There is a nasty, gooey feeling to these scenes such as there would be if one was in outer space and oxygen quantity in tow with levels of pressure were too vital. As far as dramas go, rarely does a film avoid a misstep like The Abyss does. The piece is, ultimately, the template for an adventure to allow for former romances to be rekindled while its attitude towards its premise that sees it resemble a deep-sea rescue/disaster film with a science fiction twist is the sort of Cameron genre hybridisation I can live with. One of the film's more crucial ideas revolves around when it is the entities make their presence known and to whom they appear. Many are the times wherein we watch as the character most prone to fits of hysterics is the one whose 'contact' is made first  thus, few are believers. Such is The Abyss' inherent maturity that when that happens here, it is not the character closest to psychological meltdown whose condition is abused for meek dramatics. Indeed, they are calm and measured enough to merely report that they thought they were dead on account of "seeing an Angel" approach them. The Abyss is not the Cameron film that has captured the imaginations of the many over the years, but it enthralled me.

    James Cameron's first budget-buster, this underwater sci-fi thriller briefly spawned a swarm of rip-offs, just about all of them simply Alien clones set underwater. The Abyss is more in the vein of Close Encounters, though there's a strong whiff of Aliens in some scenes. Unlike those films, this one isn't trash. It's a serious, ambitious epic, with some awe-inspiring visuals. The Oscar-winning special effects are still a joy to behold. Production design is impressive. The score adds to the epic feel. As always with Cameron, we can expect intense, relentless set-pieces, and he doesn't disappoint, with a memorable opener, disaster hitting the undersea rig, and growing hostility between the protagonists, and an unstable Navy SEAL. And on top of that, the growing suspicion they're not alone down there... A truly impressive film, but it isn't quite up there with the best of Cameron's. Filming underwater scenes always presents pacing problems, and this film is no exception. There are many long-winded, sluggish moments that cause the film to drag at times. The anti-war anti-nuke sermonizing is stronger here than in the Terminator films, and is heavy-handed to the point that it couldn't be any less subtle if the heroes were all wearing peace symbols and No Nuke T-shirts. The cast are good enough, but at times performances verge on overly histrionic, especially at the climax with Lindsay - Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonion - talking to estranged hubbie Bud - Ed Harris - as he descends into the titular crevice to defuse a nuke. I don't think much of a spoiler to reveal the aliens are friendly, as the film more than signposted that in earlier scenes. This does however present a problem - whereas the aliens in Close Encounters didn't seem aware they were causing harm by snatching the boy, it seems conveniently forgotten all of a sudden that the aliens in The Abyss inadvertently caused the deaths of the entire crew of a missile submarine. The Special Edition is even longer, close to 3 hours, but it helps flesh characters out a bit more, and we see the aliens aren't entirely sweet-natured, as they come close to causing a terrible catastrophe to avert a possible conflict between the US and the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, the Cold War subplot of the Special Edition, means it hasn't dated as well storywise as the theatrical release. A flawed film to be sure, but a likable often impressive one.

    This is a tough one. The movie holds you almost to the end in a gripping fight between good and evil. I don't want to give out any spoilers. So, I will be brief. Have you ever had a wonderful dinner at a restaurant and then they bring in a dessert, if you have room in your tummy, and it is a, let's say, beautiful, mouth-watering, delicious tasting creation. As you eat it, every bite causes you to pause to seal in your memory the sensation. Then, it breaks! You find a hair in your mouth, or worse yet, a fingernail! UGH!! Such repulsion. THAT is the sensation one gets when, after an edge-sitting, nail-biting movie, you come to the last 10 minutes or so and find you are have someone else's hair or nail in your mouth. Just note that Hollywood was really stupid to put their politically motivated morals which no terrorist or anti-American-of-old nation would ever consider. In fact, the ending was childish. The end.

    I like Cameron as a worker. I shudder when he makes what he thinks as art. The film helps explain a good deal, I think. It is in three layers, each one revealing of the man, his ethos, and a few cool things about filmmaking in general. The first layer is where a bunch of bureaucrat navy types decide on a course of action to avoid world destruction. This is where story-noise of our film is shaped, and everything we see of that story is dumb and mechanistic. Done by commission. Coincidence? The second layer is the first below water and Cameron's working space. We see a lot of rigs and hydraulic machinery here, the people are distinctly blue-collar types, the 'director' of the underwater enterprise has marital problems, as did Cameron at the time. Emphasis here is on getting a (cinematic) job done, which the film delivers with finely-tuned 'disaster movie' dynamics. A thrill ride as good as any part of Aliens. So far so good. Efficient but unspectacular. The third layer is deep in the abyss, where the 'director' takes a hopeless leap -sure to kill him- but instead is salvaged by miraculous creatures of the imagination, who supposedly have a city down there and quietly monitor humanity. Everything here amazes - deep , organic clarity in the architecture of both the arabesque city and alien creatures, the way the camera navigates by swimming inside, the textures of diaphanous light. The room where the meeting takes place and the creatures project mind-images on liquid screens is one of the most cinematic occasions I know. I cherish the film for just this scene. None of this is originally Cameron's though. It is by a man who probably changed sci-fi as much as Jules Verne, his name Moebius. You will know him chiefly through Alien and the BladeRunner, but his influence is more far-reaching than that. Now here's the problem with Cameron. The three layers have to be flattened so as to get resolutions, at least that's his plan. By nature of the thing, it's got to be settled above water, on the level of dumb story. Bad choice. Again, everything is on a huge scale. This has been a steady course of action for Cameron, since his days of rigging contraptions in Corman's movie factory. He was excellent in his work. With each success of these machines, their size got bigger, and as a result their narrative cogs grew bigger and bigger, and with so much success, so did Cameron's desire to 'educate' his audience with something constructive, since his machines were always geared for war and destruction. Like Spielberg, the more of destruction he shows, the more he feels compelled to stress out 'humane' aspects in his work. Individually, the imagery of the aliens averting nuclear war by threatening world destruction is spectacular, especially that of tsunamis arrested in their course - incidentally linking us back to the palpitating liquid walls of Moebius. But the resolution on that same grand scale is mechanically humane, pure contrivance. Cameron would grow in this direction, extending his engineer's reach from effects and machines to entire computer-generated environments, and pushing his desire to 'give back' and educate with a series of documentaries and epically hamfisted 'messages' in his films.

    The Abyss is a 1989 science fiction film, which can be characterized as an well made typical Hollywood blockbuster. If we could classify by genre, it would be a film in the underwater Alien encounter genre. It has many typical elements of a James Cameron film, such as a fairly cartoonish set of main and secondary characters and a typical love story. The film is the set in the "present day" (late 1980′s) when a nuclear submarine is intercepted and sunk by an unknown underwater object. A team of hard working divers is sent to investigate. Cameron said that he had the idea of the film's story since he was in high school, which was a story of a group of scientists working in a underwater laboratory. He changed to a group of commercial blue collar diving workers to increase the film's commercial appeal. This group of divers eventually discovers that it was a non-human intelligent lifeform that caused the accident. The special effects were the best in the world at the time the film was made, in the 1989, and they are among the main attraction of the film. The characters are also interesting, though they are a bit simple.

    The Abyss was a film that I heard a lot about on forums and saw plenty of ''if you like this, you may like...'' from Amazon, IMDb, Lovefilm, etc when looking at other films relating to the deep sea and sci-fi thrillers. So I thought I'll check it out. I found it quite entertaining for a while and interesting for the most parts. The characters were basic but understandable and you got to know the setting and situation they are in. The parts which drew you in the most were the scenes with the ''organisms'' (NTI's) flying around the base, it was mysterious and you were drawn closer as you become curious to know what they were. Much later in the film with the scene where Ed Harris jumps down into the trench to find the warhead, was when it started to get a bit absurd as he ventures into the extreme depths, but hey it's a sci-fi, so why complain right? It was actually gripping to see him go so deep. Although 5 minutes from that, the film took another route and that's when Cameron started waterboarding me with his typical ethics and morality vomit that his films are known for. I couldn't help but sulk at the end when we find out that the NTI's had been there the whole time and are going to flood all the land above due to humans destructive nature. The whole film right up to the scene where Ed Harris' character is communicating with the NTI's is a good movie, borderline great as it was entertaining, but when that scene started, it threw everything away which it had built. Suddenly I lost all interest and did not care. This film would have been an 8 from me, but due to Cameron failing to resist his classic urge to try and make the human race feel guilty, I had to sink it to a 6. Never the less, I still recommend this movie!

    James Cameron has made many great films over his career, including The Terminator, Terminator 2 and Aliens. But The Abyss is often forgotten when compared to his other films and was a box office flop when it was first released. An American Navy sub mysteriously sinks in the Cayman Trough at the height of the Cold War. With the American Navy unable to launch their own recuse operation they hire an oil drilling crew working on an experimental underwater oil platform. The US SEALs, the crew and the platform's designer, Lindsey Brigman (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) personalities start to clash underworld, with the SEALs' leader, Lt. Coffey (Michael Biehn) suffering from pressure madness, America and the Soviet Union moving closer to war and the potential discovery of alien life in the depths the ocean. The Abyss is a very tight, claustrophobic thriller which is very much about paranoid and distrust like The Thing and about the delicate state the world was in during the Cold War. The Abyss is a very character driven film, with all the characters being very distinct and memorial. I personally feared that some of the characters were going to only defined by their quirks or traits such as one of them being a conspiracy theorist and has a pet rat and other one is a woman in a cowboy hat and listens to country music, but the characters slowly get more fleshed out and likable as the film progress, particularly the relationship between Lindsey and Bud (Ed Harris). The team is as memorable as the Marines in Aliens, but there still leave an impression. Compared to most of Cameron's filmography, The Abyss is an action light film and more like a sci-fi film of old. As already mentioned that The Abyss does share similarities to The Thing because of its themes and basic settling (a group of highly trained personnel isolated in an extreme environment). At the end of the special edition The Abyss in the Special Edition also shares a lot of similarities to The Day the Earth Stood Still, with a little bit of 2010: The Year We Made Contact near the end and this is when Cameron goes on his soapbox about war and nuclear disarmament. For the time the special effects were incredible, using a combination of models and minitures and CGI. The water effects particularly hold up, especially when you still see water effect being very hard to do, like in The Last Airbender. The aliens too also had a unique design, looking like glowing stringrays with the pink, purple and blue lights and the aliens themselves had a mix of a classic grey alien look with more colour to them. Composer Alan Silverstri was also able to add to the visuals with an excellent score, using many different styles. There were heavy drums for the military to a softer choir when we see the aliens are present, giving them a divine presence. The Abyss is a long film and the Special Edition is over two and half hours and near the end the film The Abyss does start to drag. This is not helped when Cameron becomes more preachy and a little cheesy when Bud meets the aliens. The Abyss is a thoughtful, character driven sci-fi from Mr Cameron that reflects more older sci-fi films and shows that special effects should be used more then just for spectacle.

    I really do not usually do this but I was just watching this and I wanted to take a second and say this could easily be Ed Harris' best acting role, He is an amazing actor and it really shows and all this time I always said Needful things was his best, but Ill give it up to this one instead. Everyone is awesome in this film and its one I have always liked but it really moved me a little bit today and I wanted to say if you haven't watched it yet, you should.

    James Cameron's first budget-buster, this underwater sci-fi thriller briefly spawned a swarm of rip-offs, just about all of them simply Alien clones set underwater. The Abyss is more in the vein of Close Encounters, though there's a strong whiff of Aliens in some scenes. Unlike those films, this one isn't trash. It's a serious, ambitious epic, with some awe-inspiring visuals. The Oscar-winning special effects are still a joy to behold. Production design is impressive. The score adds to the epic feel. As always with Cameron, we can expect intense, relentless set-pieces, and he doesn't disappoint, with a memorable opener, disaster hitting the undersea rig, and growing hostility between the protagonists, and an unstable Navy SEAL. And on top of that, the growing suspicion they're not alone down there... A truly impressive film, but it isn't quite up there with the best of Cameron's. Filming underwater scenes always presents pacing problems, and this film is no exception. There are many long-winded, sluggish moments that cause the film to drag at times. The anti-war anti-nuke sermonizing is stronger here than in the Terminator films, and is heavy-handed to the point that it couldn't be any less subtle if the heroes were all wearing peace symbols and No Nuke T-shirts. The cast are good enough, but at times performances verge on overly histrionic, especially at the climax with Lindsay - Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonion - talking to estranged hubbie Bud - Ed Harris - as he descends into the titular crevice to defuse a nuke. I don't think much of a spoiler to reveal the aliens are friendly, as the film more than signposted that in earlier scenes. This does however present a problem - whereas the aliens in Close Encounters didn't seem aware they were causing harm by snatching the boy, it seems conveniently forgotten all of a sudden that the aliens in The Abyss inadvertently caused the deaths of the entire crew of a missile submarine. The Special Edition is even longer, close to 3 hours, but it helps flesh characters out a bit more, and we see the aliens aren't entirely sweet-natured, as they come close to causing a terrible catastrophe to avert a possible conflict between the US and the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, the Cold War subplot of the Special Edition, means it hasn't dated as well storywise as the theatrical release. A flawed film to be sure, but a likable often impressive one.

    This is a tough one. The movie holds you almost to the end in a gripping fight between good and evil. I don't want to give out any spoilers. So, I will be brief. Have you ever had a wonderful dinner at a restaurant and then they bring in a dessert, if you have room in your tummy, and it is a, let's say, beautiful, mouth-watering, delicious tasting creation. As you eat it, every bite causes you to pause to seal in your memory the sensation. Then, it breaks! You find a hair in your mouth, or worse yet, a fingernail! UGH!! Such repulsion. THAT is the sensation one gets when, after an edge-sitting, nail-biting movie, you come to the last 10 minutes or so and find you are have someone else's hair or nail in your mouth. Just note that Hollywood was really stupid to put their politically motivated morals which no terrorist or anti-American-of-old nation would ever consider. In fact, the ending was childish. The end.

    I like Cameron as a worker. I shudder when he makes what he thinks as art. The film helps explain a good deal, I think. It is in three layers, each one revealing of the man, his ethos, and a few cool things about filmmaking in general. The first layer is where a bunch of bureaucrat navy types decide on a course of action to avoid world destruction. This is where story-noise of our film is shaped, and everything we see of that story is dumb and mechanistic. Done by commission. Coincidence? The second layer is the first below water and Cameron's working space. We see a lot of rigs and hydraulic machinery here, the people are distinctly blue-collar types, the 'director' of the underwater enterprise has marital problems, as did Cameron at the time. Emphasis here is on getting a (cinematic) job done, which the film delivers with finely-tuned 'disaster movie' dynamics. A thrill ride as good as any part of Aliens. So far so good. Efficient but unspectacular. The third layer is deep in the abyss, where the 'director' takes a hopeless leap -sure to kill him- but instead is salvaged by miraculous creatures of the imagination, who supposedly have a city down there and quietly monitor humanity. Everything here amazes - deep , organic clarity in the architecture of both the arabesque city and alien creatures, the way the camera navigates by swimming inside, the textures of diaphanous light. The room where the meeting takes place and the creatures project mind-images on liquid screens is one of the most cinematic occasions I know. I cherish the film for just this scene. None of this is originally Cameron's though. It is by a man who probably changed sci-fi as much as Jules Verne, his name Moebius. You will know him chiefly through Alien and the BladeRunner, but his influence is more far-reaching than that. Now here's the problem with Cameron. The three layers have to be flattened so as to get resolutions, at least that's his plan. By nature of the thing, it's got to be settled above water, on the level of dumb story. Bad choice. Again, everything is on a huge scale. This has been a steady course of action for Cameron, since his days of rigging contraptions in Corman's movie factory. He was excellent in his work. With each success of these machines, their size got bigger, and as a result their narrative cogs grew bigger and bigger, and with so much success, so did Cameron's desire to 'educate' his audience with something constructive, since his machines were always geared for war and destruction. Like Spielberg, the more of destruction he shows, the more he feels compelled to stress out 'humane' aspects in his work. Individually, the imagery of the aliens averting nuclear war by threatening world destruction is spectacular, especially that of tsunamis arrested in their course - incidentally linking us back to the palpitating liquid walls of Moebius. But the resolution on that same grand scale is mechanically humane, pure contrivance. Cameron would grow in this direction, extending his engineer's reach from effects and machines to entire computer-generated environments, and pushing his desire to 'give back' and educate with a series of documentaries and epically hamfisted 'messages' in his films.

    The Abyss is a 1989 science fiction film, which can be characterized as an well made typical Hollywood blockbuster. If we could classify by genre, it would be a film in the underwater Alien encounter genre. It has many typical elements of a James Cameron film, such as a fairly cartoonish set of main and secondary characters and a typical love story. The film is the set in the "present day" (late 1980′s) when a nuclear submarine is intercepted and sunk by an unknown underwater object. A team of hard working divers is sent to investigate. Cameron said that he had the idea of the film's story since he was in high school, which was a story of a group of scientists working in a underwater laboratory. He changed to a group of commercial blue collar diving workers to increase the film's commercial appeal. This group of divers eventually discovers that it was a non-human intelligent lifeform that caused the accident. The special effects were the best in the world at the time the film was made, in the 1989, and they are among the main attraction of the film. The characters are also interesting, though they are a bit simple.

    The Abyss was a film that I heard a lot about on forums and saw plenty of ''if you like this, you may like...'' from Amazon, IMDb, Lovefilm, etc when looking at other films relating to the deep sea and sci-fi thrillers. So I thought I'll check it out. I found it quite entertaining for a while and interesting for the most parts. The characters were basic but understandable and you got to know the setting and situation they are in. The parts which drew you in the most were the scenes with the ''organisms'' (NTI's) flying around the base, it was mysterious and you were drawn closer as you become curious to know what they were. Much later in the film with the scene where Ed Harris jumps down into the trench to find the warhead, was when it started to get a bit absurd as he ventures into the extreme depths, but hey it's a sci-fi, so why complain right? It was actually gripping to see him go so deep. Although 5 minutes from that, the film took another route and that's when Cameron started waterboarding me with his typical ethics and morality vomit that his films are known for. I couldn't help but sulk at the end when we find out that the NTI's had been there the whole time and are going to flood all the land above due to humans destructive nature. The whole film right up to the scene where Ed Harris' character is communicating with the NTI's is a good movie, borderline great as it was entertaining, but when that scene started, it threw everything away which it had built. Suddenly I lost all interest and did not care. This film would have been an 8 from me, but due to Cameron failing to resist his classic urge to try and make the human race feel guilty, I had to sink it to a 6. Never the less, I still recommend this movie!
