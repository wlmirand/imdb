    Pet Detective Ace Ventura (Jim Carrey) is the man you call when crimes happen to animals. When Miami Dolphins' mascot dolphin Snowflake is stolen from its watertank, team official Melissa Robinson (Courteney Cox) must ask Ace Ventura to investigate. Police Lieutenant Lois Einhorn (Sean Young) hates the brash pet detective, but he always seems to be out-think everyone. Jim Carrey has made a virtue of going over the top. And he is extremely virtuous in this movie. He's at his rubbery best playing with animals and talking thru his butt. It's shocking at first. Then it gets cute. Then it gets a bit tired but the movie ends before it became annoying. For some, the movie probably didn't end soon enough. The antics get tiring. It just doesn't end. Although the final reveal is hilarious. The movie is just good enough to be fun.

    Disappointment. It seemed like they got a great cast of actors and the Miami Dolphins pro football team together to make a comedy, then realized that they needed to write a funny script and had writer's block. Jim Carrey is his usual silly goof and his humorist brilliance does show through but the story is rather lame, stupid and painful to watch. The story is also not child friendly as in the opening scene there is a oral sex joke and there is s sprinkling of adult humor throughout the movie. Cringe alert. Parents beware, this is a case of Hollywood being out of touch with the mainstream. Carrey's follow on movies "the Mask" and "Bruce Almighty" are much better but you can't use their success to judge this film. It is just not as good.

    Story/Plot - Ace Ventura (Jim Carrey) is a slightly crazy yet lovable character. He has a love for animals and detection. Ace Ventura is able to think like an animal and also think like a criminal. This giving him the edge over the real police. Starting off by rescuing a stolen dog from a very angry man by posing as a courier right through to then end by rescuing the beloved mascot of an American Football team, a dolphin. Ace is pure comedy and still manages to win the heart of Melissa Robinson (Courteney Cox). My verdict - If you want to spend over an hour laughing your head off and in suspense then I fully recommend you watch Ace Ventura Pet Detective. You will definitely not be disappointed with this film. Outstanding screen play by Jim Carrey who moulds into his character extremely well, he is accompanied by a fine performance by the lovely Courteney Cox, who I must say looks fabulous.

    Ace Ventura is a pet detective. The job is to investigate various missing or abused animals and return them to their rightful owners. His big case is when Miami Dolphins mascot Snowflake (an actual dolphin) get's stolen. Melissa (Courtney Cox) who works with the Dolphins is there to help Ace on the case, and along the way they fall in love. Ace eventually realizes that it is a bitter former player named Ray Finkle who has kidnapped Snowflake, and it's up to him to find Ray and retrieve the mammal before Superbowl Sunday. I liked this one a lot. There are quite a lot of funny moments, one's that stick out are; Ace making a fool of himself at a fancy party for rich people, Ace pretending to be insane at a mental institution, and Ace's various scenes at the police station. I can see why some people might find the character Ace annoying, I started too as it went along. But it is necessary for the character to be obnoxious/loud, and Jim Carrey plays over the top so well. The rest of the actors were good as well including Courtney Cox and Sean Young as "Lois" the police detective with a secret.. I enjoyed the mystery aspect of 'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective', having to first find Ray Finkle and then find out who Ray Finkle really is. Lot's of comedic moments and an interesting plot equals good in my books 7/10

    Ace Ventura: Pet Detective is a comedy film starring Jim Carrey,who plays the title role. It was developed by the film's original writer, Jack Bernstein, and co-producer, Bob Israel. It co-stars Courteney Cox, Tone Lōc, Sean Young and former Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino. Ace Ventura is a low-rent private eye who specializes in recovering lost animals, so when Snowflake, the Miami Dolphins' aquatic mascot, is kidnapped, team representative Melissa Robinson puts Ace on the case. However, Snowflake isn't the only Miami Dolphin who has gone missing; several key members of the team also disappear, including quarterback Dan Marino, who is spirited away while filming a TV commercial. With the Super Bowl only two weeks away, will Ace be able to find Snowflake and the missing athletes in time to salvage the big game? Unlike famous bumbling sleuths such as Inspector Clouseau and Lt. Frank Drebin, there's no consistency to the "Ace" character, and the whole movie shifts in tone from social satire to sophomoric pranks and traditional cop show plotting.But nevertheless,this is a perfect platform for Jim Carrey to showcase his physical comedy skills.

    Coming from nowhere, a hand is grabbing his shoulder, and a voice says in a very ominous tone: "Mr. Ventura?" to which the character of the same name replies: "Yes  (brief pause) Satan?" The chances for such jokes to work only depend on the believability of its lead character even as a comical protagonist, but it's Jim Carrey who carries the film, and for some magical reason, he turns a very wacky script (in a simple-minded way) into a funny, and sometimes hilarious, comedy. Granted it's not the most elegant or sophisticated one, but I liked it, I liked it so much I could watch it again, and still laugh at the lousiest jokes. Now, that's still a tough review to give, because as much as I have the deepest respect for such distinguished critics as Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert, it would be a lie if I said that I didn't laugh at "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective". They're right that the film had a kind of immature appeal and uses a character that plays the same one-note nerdy twisted geek all along; still, it made me laugh. Maybe it's the most primary and raunchy level of humor, maybe I shouldn't even be entitled to judge another film, let alone a comedy, if I was capable to appreciate Tom Shadyak's film. But I guess I would be more to blame if I was pretending not to love it just to look smart. Hell, I don't even know why I'm feeling sorry to love the film, I really do, and too bad some people couldn't laugh at it. "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" is so straightforward in its approach to comedy that it's nearly impossible to find it unfunny. Even when the jokes don't work and actually, I can't think of one (well, I didn't like the performance of the kidnapped athlete but never mind), you have Jim Carrey who saves the day by playing the most obnoxious cinematic character ever. Two things I don't get by the way: how could he ever get a Razzie nomination for his performance and how could Roger Ebert hate the character for what was his most defining characteristic? It's precisely because he was obnoxious that Ace Ventura was funny, think about it, a man who loves animals so much that he hates human. Does it make sense? What's the matter, as long as it makes laugh? And the opening scene of the couldn't have set the tone any better, Ventura carries a sort of fragile bag with such carelessness, any clairvoyant mind would automatically wonder if there is some fragile stuff inside or if it's just an undercover. The whole opening credits consists on showing him mistreating the little case, just in case we forgot that. Tom Shadyak, who directed "Dumb and Dumber" the same year, directs the film as if he was exaggeratedly taking his viewers for dumb people. But seriously, I don't mind having my intelligence insulted when it's done for humorous purpose, and when it starts being funny, it becomes most intelligent than any traditional gag. Let me explain this better: just because it's Jim Carrey, the movie can get away with everything. Really? Like he would "Re-he-he-he- heaaaally?" (And I laughed at that line, too) So, Ace enters the houses, gives the case and take the kidnapped dog back, the chase scene that follows is so over the top, especially when Ventura finally starts the car and screaming "it's alive", Shadyak gives the final deathblow to any expectation of a "serious comedy" and to the last skeptical minds, you have Ventura's award from the little dog's mistress. What can I say about this part? Well, Mel Brooks said once that "The Producers" 'rose below vulgarity', "Ace Ventura" is probably the comedy that comes the closest to that definition. Indeed, "Ace Ventura" belongs to a special kind of comedies, dumb enough to be funny, without being annoying, and smart enough to  nah, it's not that smart, or maybe it's smart in the way it's funny when it shouldn't normally be. Bad acting? Over-the-top situations? Don't ask me why but in the very context of Ace Ventura, they all work. The plot? The Miami football team's mascot, a dolphin, has been stolen and Ace Ventura must find it, he meets the beautiful Courteney Cox and two of them make a strange pair. We know how it would end between them but then again, it's handled in an over-the-top comical way. It's outrageous, raunchy, but how about when Jim Carrey is looking for one of the ex-football team champions, and has to check if they have a ring in their fingers. At one point, he's looking at one athlete in the toilet with a strange eye, and this is not even the funniest gag. There is one scene where he realized that one person he's just kissed isn't a woman and his reaction is priceless and for very gutsy when you think of it. Some would say it's homophobic but it mocks more the homophobic attitude than homosexuality. And if people can't get that, no wonder they would find the rest of the film unfunny. Dolphins, football, a cruel and tough but beautiful police inspector played by Sean Young, the beautiful Courteney Cox, and Jim Carrey teasing people, being nerdy, obnoxious, calling them ugly, talking with his ass, you almost have the feeling, it's a one-note performance, but it takes some great acting skills to carry one film alone like Carrey does. With "The Mask", "Dumb and Dumber" and "Ace Ventura" (all of them in the Top 10 highest-grossing films), 1994 was the breakthrough year of Jim Carrey, that launched his career and put him in the Hall of Fame of the greatest comedic performers. And you have to give credit to Jim Carrey, especially because he played three different characters  and he's just too damn funny.

    This film is not very good. It's one of those films with Jim Carrey that aren't that funny. Jim Carrey is a weird type of actor.. You see him in Liar Liar and he makes you crack up on the floor laughing and then you see him in this film and others such as Yesman, and you come to question if he really is a funny character or maybe its the scripts that are sometimes badly written :/ anyway back to the film, I didn't like it too much as it wasn't too good. A 6/10 seems the perfect vote because it's not a complete and utter fiasco but it's not that good either. If I were you I wouldn't bother watching this film, unless you are a true Jim Carrey fan and you want to see all movies. x

    I first watched this when it was released on video and I have to say it's one of my favs! Jim Carrey is classic in this, his best movie by far. I have never seen anything like it and probably won't again. It's fresh, the pace is good and the acting by Carrey is very funny. It's light, entertaining and no too serious which means you can tune in and out without really missing much. Everyone who has seen this has loved it and I can't see why you wouldn't. Pet detective 2 is also good but not a touch on this original. If you want a laugh and haven't seen this go and buy it now.

    Undeniably juvenile, but funny and entertaining comedy stars Carreyin his breakthrough roleas a goofy, wildly eccentric pet detective hired to find the missing Miami Dolphins mascot. He's the right man for the job but his childish idiosyncrasies, uncanny bond with animals, and aberrant investigative techniques cause outsiders to question whether or not he can actually make good on his word. Aimed mostly at fans who really enjoy silly humor, others will probably find it lame and tiresome. There are some amusing cameos by real Dolphin football players (including an engaging Dan Marino) but this film belongs to Carrey and his constant outrageousness. Sure-fire entertainment for fans of this genre. **&frac12;

    This film is not very good. It's one of those films with Jim Carrey that aren't that funny. Jim Carrey is a weird type of actor.. You see him in Liar Liar and he makes you crack up on the floor laughing and then you see him in this film and others such as Yesman, and you come to question if he really is a funny character or maybe its the scripts that are sometimes badly written :/ anyway back to the film, I didn't like it too much as it wasn't too good. A 6/10 seems the perfect vote because it's not a complete and utter fiasco but it's not that good either. If I were you I wouldn't bother watching this film, unless you are a true Jim Carrey fan and you want to see all movies. x

    I first watched this when it was released on video and I have to say it's one of my favs! Jim Carrey is classic in this, his best movie by far. I have never seen anything like it and probably won't again. It's fresh, the pace is good and the acting by Carrey is very funny. It's light, entertaining and no too serious which means you can tune in and out without really missing much. Everyone who has seen this has loved it and I can't see why you wouldn't. Pet detective 2 is also good but not a touch on this original. If you want a laugh and haven't seen this go and buy it now.

    Undeniably juvenile, but funny and entertaining comedy stars Carreyin his breakthrough roleas a goofy, wildly eccentric pet detective hired to find the missing Miami Dolphins mascot. He's the right man for the job but his childish idiosyncrasies, uncanny bond with animals, and aberrant investigative techniques cause outsiders to question whether or not he can actually make good on his word. Aimed mostly at fans who really enjoy silly humor, others will probably find it lame and tiresome. There are some amusing cameos by real Dolphin football players (including an engaging Dan Marino) but this film belongs to Carrey and his constant outrageousness. Sure-fire entertainment for fans of this genre. **&frac12;

    Pet Detective Ace Ventura (Jim Carrey) is the man you call when crimes happen to animals. When Miami Dolphins' mascot dolphin Snowflake is stolen from its watertank, team official Melissa Robinson (Courteney Cox) must ask Ace Ventura to investigate. Police Lieutenant Lois Einhorn (Sean Young) hates the brash pet detective, but he always seems to be out-think everyone. Jim Carrey has made a virtue of going over the top. And he is extremely virtuous in this movie. He's at his rubbery best playing with animals and talking thru his butt. It's shocking at first. Then it gets cute. Then it gets a bit tired but the movie ends before it became annoying. For some, the movie probably didn't end soon enough. The antics get tiring. It just doesn't end. Although the final reveal is hilarious. The movie is just good enough to be fun.

    Disappointment. It seemed like they got a great cast of actors and the Miami Dolphins pro football team together to make a comedy, then realized that they needed to write a funny script and had writer's block. Jim Carrey is his usual silly goof and his humorist brilliance does show through but the story is rather lame, stupid and painful to watch. The story is also not child friendly as in the opening scene there is a oral sex joke and there is s sprinkling of adult humor throughout the movie. Cringe alert. Parents beware, this is a case of Hollywood being out of touch with the mainstream. Carrey's follow on movies "the Mask" and "Bruce Almighty" are much better but you can't use their success to judge this film. It is just not as good.

    Story/Plot - Ace Ventura (Jim Carrey) is a slightly crazy yet lovable character. He has a love for animals and detection. Ace Ventura is able to think like an animal and also think like a criminal. This giving him the edge over the real police. Starting off by rescuing a stolen dog from a very angry man by posing as a courier right through to then end by rescuing the beloved mascot of an American Football team, a dolphin. Ace is pure comedy and still manages to win the heart of Melissa Robinson (Courteney Cox). My verdict - If you want to spend over an hour laughing your head off and in suspense then I fully recommend you watch Ace Ventura Pet Detective. You will definitely not be disappointed with this film. Outstanding screen play by Jim Carrey who moulds into his character extremely well, he is accompanied by a fine performance by the lovely Courteney Cox, who I must say looks fabulous.

    Ace Ventura is a pet detective. The job is to investigate various missing or abused animals and return them to their rightful owners. His big case is when Miami Dolphins mascot Snowflake (an actual dolphin) get's stolen. Melissa (Courtney Cox) who works with the Dolphins is there to help Ace on the case, and along the way they fall in love. Ace eventually realizes that it is a bitter former player named Ray Finkle who has kidnapped Snowflake, and it's up to him to find Ray and retrieve the mammal before Superbowl Sunday. I liked this one a lot. There are quite a lot of funny moments, one's that stick out are; Ace making a fool of himself at a fancy party for rich people, Ace pretending to be insane at a mental institution, and Ace's various scenes at the police station. I can see why some people might find the character Ace annoying, I started too as it went along. But it is necessary for the character to be obnoxious/loud, and Jim Carrey plays over the top so well. The rest of the actors were good as well including Courtney Cox and Sean Young as "Lois" the police detective with a secret.. I enjoyed the mystery aspect of 'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective', having to first find Ray Finkle and then find out who Ray Finkle really is. Lot's of comedic moments and an interesting plot equals good in my books 7/10

    Ace Ventura: Pet Detective is a comedy film starring Jim Carrey,who plays the title role. It was developed by the film's original writer, Jack Bernstein, and co-producer, Bob Israel. It co-stars Courteney Cox, Tone Lōc, Sean Young and former Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino. Ace Ventura is a low-rent private eye who specializes in recovering lost animals, so when Snowflake, the Miami Dolphins' aquatic mascot, is kidnapped, team representative Melissa Robinson puts Ace on the case. However, Snowflake isn't the only Miami Dolphin who has gone missing; several key members of the team also disappear, including quarterback Dan Marino, who is spirited away while filming a TV commercial. With the Super Bowl only two weeks away, will Ace be able to find Snowflake and the missing athletes in time to salvage the big game? Unlike famous bumbling sleuths such as Inspector Clouseau and Lt. Frank Drebin, there's no consistency to the "Ace" character, and the whole movie shifts in tone from social satire to sophomoric pranks and traditional cop show plotting.But nevertheless,this is a perfect platform for Jim Carrey to showcase his physical comedy skills.

    Coming from nowhere, a hand is grabbing his shoulder, and a voice says in a very ominous tone: "Mr. Ventura?" to which the character of the same name replies: "Yes  (brief pause) Satan?" The chances for such jokes to work only depend on the believability of its lead character even as a comical protagonist, but it's Jim Carrey who carries the film, and for some magical reason, he turns a very wacky script (in a simple-minded way) into a funny, and sometimes hilarious, comedy. Granted it's not the most elegant or sophisticated one, but I liked it, I liked it so much I could watch it again, and still laugh at the lousiest jokes. Now, that's still a tough review to give, because as much as I have the deepest respect for such distinguished critics as Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert, it would be a lie if I said that I didn't laugh at "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective". They're right that the film had a kind of immature appeal and uses a character that plays the same one-note nerdy twisted geek all along; still, it made me laugh. Maybe it's the most primary and raunchy level of humor, maybe I shouldn't even be entitled to judge another film, let alone a comedy, if I was capable to appreciate Tom Shadyak's film. But I guess I would be more to blame if I was pretending not to love it just to look smart. Hell, I don't even know why I'm feeling sorry to love the film, I really do, and too bad some people couldn't laugh at it. "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" is so straightforward in its approach to comedy that it's nearly impossible to find it unfunny. Even when the jokes don't work and actually, I can't think of one (well, I didn't like the performance of the kidnapped athlete but never mind), you have Jim Carrey who saves the day by playing the most obnoxious cinematic character ever. Two things I don't get by the way: how could he ever get a Razzie nomination for his performance and how could Roger Ebert hate the character for what was his most defining characteristic? It's precisely because he was obnoxious that Ace Ventura was funny, think about it, a man who loves animals so much that he hates human. Does it make sense? What's the matter, as long as it makes laugh? And the opening scene of the couldn't have set the tone any better, Ventura carries a sort of fragile bag with such carelessness, any clairvoyant mind would automatically wonder if there is some fragile stuff inside or if it's just an undercover. The whole opening credits consists on showing him mistreating the little case, just in case we forgot that. Tom Shadyak, who directed "Dumb and Dumber" the same year, directs the film as if he was exaggeratedly taking his viewers for dumb people. But seriously, I don't mind having my intelligence insulted when it's done for humorous purpose, and when it starts being funny, it becomes most intelligent than any traditional gag. Let me explain this better: just because it's Jim Carrey, the movie can get away with everything. Really? Like he would "Re-he-he-he- heaaaally?" (And I laughed at that line, too) So, Ace enters the houses, gives the case and take the kidnapped dog back, the chase scene that follows is so over the top, especially when Ventura finally starts the car and screaming "it's alive", Shadyak gives the final deathblow to any expectation of a "serious comedy" and to the last skeptical minds, you have Ventura's award from the little dog's mistress. What can I say about this part? Well, Mel Brooks said once that "The Producers" 'rose below vulgarity', "Ace Ventura" is probably the comedy that comes the closest to that definition. Indeed, "Ace Ventura" belongs to a special kind of comedies, dumb enough to be funny, without being annoying, and smart enough to  nah, it's not that smart, or maybe it's smart in the way it's funny when it shouldn't normally be. Bad acting? Over-the-top situations? Don't ask me why but in the very context of Ace Ventura, they all work. The plot? The Miami football team's mascot, a dolphin, has been stolen and Ace Ventura must find it, he meets the beautiful Courteney Cox and two of them make a strange pair. We know how it would end between them but then again, it's handled in an over-the-top comical way. It's outrageous, raunchy, but how about when Jim Carrey is looking for one of the ex-football team champions, and has to check if they have a ring in their fingers. At one point, he's looking at one athlete in the toilet with a strange eye, and this is not even the funniest gag. There is one scene where he realized that one person he's just kissed isn't a woman and his reaction is priceless and for very gutsy when you think of it. Some would say it's homophobic but it mocks more the homophobic attitude than homosexuality. And if people can't get that, no wonder they would find the rest of the film unfunny. Dolphins, football, a cruel and tough but beautiful police inspector played by Sean Young, the beautiful Courteney Cox, and Jim Carrey teasing people, being nerdy, obnoxious, calling them ugly, talking with his ass, you almost have the feeling, it's a one-note performance, but it takes some great acting skills to carry one film alone like Carrey does. With "The Mask", "Dumb and Dumber" and "Ace Ventura" (all of them in the Top 10 highest-grossing films), 1994 was the breakthrough year of Jim Carrey, that launched his career and put him in the Hall of Fame of the greatest comedic performers. And you have to give credit to Jim Carrey, especially because he played three different characters  and he's just too damn funny.

We know how it would end between them but then again, it's handled in an over-the-top comical way. It's outrageous, raunchy, but how about when Jim Carrey is looking for one of the ex-football team champions, and has to check if they have a ring in their fingers. At one point, he's looking at one athlete in the toilet with a strange eye, and this is not even the funniest gag. There is one scene where he realized that one person he's just kissed isn't a woman and his reaction is priceless and for very gutsy when you think of it. Some would say it's homophobic but it mocks more the homophobic attitude than homosexuality. And if people can't get that, no wonder they would find the rest of the film unfunny. Dolphins, football, a cruel and tough but beautiful police inspector played by Sean Young, the beautiful Courteney Cox, and Jim Carrey teasing people, being nerdy, obnoxious, calling them ugly, talking with his ass, you almost have the feeling, it's a one-note performance, but it takes some great acting skills to carry one film alone like Carrey does. With "The Mask", "Dumb and Dumber" and "Ace Ventura" (all of them in the Top 10 highest-grossing films), 1994 was the breakthrough year of Jim Carrey, that launched his career and put him in the Hall of Fame of the greatest comedic performers. And you have to give credit to Jim Carrey, especially because he played three different characters  and he's just too damn funny.

    This film is not very good. It's one of those films with Jim Carrey that aren't that funny. Jim Carrey is a weird type of actor.. You see him in Liar Liar and he makes you crack up on the floor laughing and then you see him in this film and others such as Yesman, and you come to question if he really is a funny character or maybe its the scripts that are sometimes badly written :/ anyway back to the film, I didn't like it too much as it wasn't too good. A 6/10 seems the perfect vote because it's not a complete and utter fiasco but it's not that good either. If I were you I wouldn't bother watching this film, unless you are a true Jim Carrey fan and you want to see all movies. x

    I first watched this when it was released on video and I have to say it's one of my favs! Jim Carrey is classic in this, his best movie by far. I have never seen anything like it and probably won't again. It's fresh, the pace is good and the acting by Carrey is very funny. It's light, entertaining and no too serious which means you can tune in and out without really missing much. Everyone who has seen this has loved it and I can't see why you wouldn't. Pet detective 2 is also good but not a touch on this original. If you want a laugh and haven't seen this go and buy it now.

    Undeniably juvenile, but funny and entertaining comedy stars Carreyin his breakthrough roleas a goofy, wildly eccentric pet detective hired to find the missing Miami Dolphins mascot. He's the right man for the job but his childish idiosyncrasies, uncanny bond with animals, and aberrant investigative techniques cause outsiders to question whether or not he can actually make good on his word. Aimed mostly at fans who really enjoy silly humor, others will probably find it lame and tiresome. There are some amusing cameos by real Dolphin football players (including an engaging Dan Marino) but this film belongs to Carrey and his constant outrageousness. Sure-fire entertainment for fans of this genre. **&frac12;

    Pet Detective Ace Ventura (Jim Carrey) is the man you call when crimes happen to animals. When Miami Dolphins' mascot dolphin Snowflake is stolen from its watertank, team official Melissa Robinson (Courteney Cox) must ask Ace Ventura to investigate. Police Lieutenant Lois Einhorn (Sean Young) hates the brash pet detective, but he always seems to be out-think everyone. Jim Carrey has made a virtue of going over the top. And he is extremely virtuous in this movie. He's at his rubbery best playing with animals and talking thru his butt. It's shocking at first. Then it gets cute. Then it gets a bit tired but the movie ends before it became annoying. For some, the movie probably didn't end soon enough. The antics get tiring. It just doesn't end. Although the final reveal is hilarious. The movie is just good enough to be fun.

    Disappointment. It seemed like they got a great cast of actors and the Miami Dolphins pro football team together to make a comedy, then realized that they needed to write a funny script and had writer's block. Jim Carrey is his usual silly goof and his humorist brilliance does show through but the story is rather lame, stupid and painful to watch. The story is also not child friendly as in the opening scene there is a oral sex joke and there is s sprinkling of adult humor throughout the movie. Cringe alert. Parents beware, this is a case of Hollywood being out of touch with the mainstream. Carrey's follow on movies "the Mask" and "Bruce Almighty" are much better but you can't use their success to judge this film. It is just not as good.

    Story/Plot - Ace Ventura (Jim Carrey) is a slightly crazy yet lovable character. He has a love for animals and detection. Ace Ventura is able to think like an animal and also think like a criminal. This giving him the edge over the real police. Starting off by rescuing a stolen dog from a very angry man by posing as a courier right through to then end by rescuing the beloved mascot of an American Football team, a dolphin. Ace is pure comedy and still manages to win the heart of Melissa Robinson (Courteney Cox). My verdict - If you want to spend over an hour laughing your head off and in suspense then I fully recommend you watch Ace Ventura Pet Detective. You will definitely not be disappointed with this film. Outstanding screen play by Jim Carrey who moulds into his character extremely well, he is accompanied by a fine performance by the lovely Courteney Cox, who I must say looks fabulous.

    Ace Ventura is a pet detective. The job is to investigate various missing or abused animals and return them to their rightful owners. His big case is when Miami Dolphins mascot Snowflake (an actual dolphin) get's stolen. Melissa (Courtney Cox) who works with the Dolphins is there to help Ace on the case, and along the way they fall in love. Ace eventually realizes that it is a bitter former player named Ray Finkle who has kidnapped Snowflake, and it's up to him to find Ray and retrieve the mammal before Superbowl Sunday. I liked this one a lot. There are quite a lot of funny moments, one's that stick out are; Ace making a fool of himself at a fancy party for rich people, Ace pretending to be insane at a mental institution, and Ace's various scenes at the police station. I can see why some people might find the character Ace annoying, I started too as it went along. But it is necessary for the character to be obnoxious/loud, and Jim Carrey plays over the top so well. The rest of the actors were good as well including Courtney Cox and Sean Young as "Lois" the police detective with a secret.. I enjoyed the mystery aspect of 'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective', having to first find Ray Finkle and then find out who Ray Finkle really is. Lot's of comedic moments and an interesting plot equals good in my books 7/10

    Ace Ventura: Pet Detective is a comedy film starring Jim Carrey,who plays the title role. It was developed by the film's original writer, Jack Bernstein, and co-producer, Bob Israel. It co-stars Courteney Cox, Tone Lōc, Sean Young and former Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino. Ace Ventura is a low-rent private eye who specializes in recovering lost animals, so when Snowflake, the Miami Dolphins' aquatic mascot, is kidnapped, team representative Melissa Robinson puts Ace on the case. However, Snowflake isn't the only Miami Dolphin who has gone missing; several key members of the team also disappear, including quarterback Dan Marino, who is spirited away while filming a TV commercial. With the Super Bowl only two weeks away, will Ace be able to find Snowflake and the missing athletes in time to salvage the big game? Unlike famous bumbling sleuths such as Inspector Clouseau and Lt. Frank Drebin, there's no consistency to the "Ace" character, and the whole movie shifts in tone from social satire to sophomoric pranks and traditional cop show plotting.But nevertheless,this is a perfect platform for Jim Carrey to showcase his physical comedy skills.

    Coming from nowhere, a hand is grabbing his shoulder, and a voice says in a very ominous tone: "Mr. Ventura?" to which the character of the same name replies: "Yes  (brief pause) Satan?" The chances for such jokes to work only depend on the believability of its lead character even as a comical protagonist, but it's Jim Carrey who carries the film, and for some magical reason, he turns a very wacky script (in a simple-minded way) into a funny, and sometimes hilarious, comedy. Granted it's not the most elegant or sophisticated one, but I liked it, I liked it so much I could watch it again, and still laugh at the lousiest jokes. Now, that's still a tough review to give, because as much as I have the deepest respect for such distinguished critics as Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert, it would be a lie if I said that I didn't laugh at "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective". They're right that the film had a kind of immature appeal and uses a character that plays the same one-note nerdy twisted geek all along; still, it made me laugh. Maybe it's the most primary and raunchy level of humor, maybe I shouldn't even be entitled to judge another film, let alone a comedy, if I was capable to appreciate Tom Shadyak's film. But I guess I would be more to blame if I was pretending not to love it just to look smart. Hell, I don't even know why I'm feeling sorry to love the film, I really do, and too bad some people couldn't laugh at it. "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" is so straightforward in its approach to comedy that it's nearly impossible to find it unfunny. Even when the jokes don't work and actually, I can't think of one (well, I didn't like the performance of the kidnapped athlete but never mind), you have Jim Carrey who saves the day by playing the most obnoxious cinematic character ever. Two things I don't get by the way: how could he ever get a Razzie nomination for his performance and how could Roger Ebert hate the character for what was his most defining characteristic? It's precisely because he was obnoxious that Ace Ventura was funny, think about it, a man who loves animals so much that he hates human. Does it make sense? What's the matter, as long as it makes laugh? And the opening scene of the couldn't have set the tone any better, Ventura carries a sort of fragile bag with such carelessness, any clairvoyant mind would automatically wonder if there is some fragile stuff inside or if it's just an undercover. The whole opening credits consists on showing him mistreating the little case, just in case we forgot that. Tom Shadyak, who directed "Dumb and Dumber" the same year, directs the film as if he was exaggeratedly taking his viewers for dumb people. But seriously, I don't mind having my intelligence insulted when it's done for humorous purpose, and when it starts being funny, it becomes most intelligent than any traditional gag. Let me explain this better: just because it's Jim Carrey, the movie can get away with everything. Really? Like he would "Re-he-he-he- heaaaally?" (And I laughed at that line, too) So, Ace enters the houses, gives the case and take the kidnapped dog back, the chase scene that follows is so over the top, especially when Ventura finally starts the car and screaming "it's alive", Shadyak gives the final deathblow to any expectation of a "serious comedy" and to the last skeptical minds, you have Ventura's award from the little dog's mistress. What can I say about this part? Well, Mel Brooks said once that "The Producers" 'rose below vulgarity', "Ace Ventura" is probably the comedy that comes the closest to that definition. Indeed, "Ace Ventura" belongs to a special kind of comedies, dumb enough to be funny, without being annoying, and smart enough to  nah, it's not that smart, or maybe it's smart in the way it's funny when it shouldn't normally be. Bad acting? Over-the-top situations? Don't ask me why but in the very context of Ace Ventura, they all work. The plot? The Miami football team's mascot, a dolphin, has been stolen and Ace Ventura must find it, he meets the beautiful Courteney Cox and two of them make a strange pair. We know how it would end between them but then again, it's handled in an over-the-top comical way. It's outrageous, raunchy, but how about when Jim Carrey is looking for one of the ex-football team champions, and has to check if they have a ring in their fingers. At one point, he's looking at one athlete in the toilet with a strange eye, and this is not even the funniest gag. There is one scene where he realized that one person he's just kissed isn't a woman and his reaction is priceless and for very gutsy when you think of it. Some would say it's homophobic but it mocks more the homophobic attitude than homosexuality. And if people can't get that, no wonder they would find the rest of the film unfunny. Dolphins, football, a cruel and tough but beautiful police inspector played by Sean Young, the beautiful Courteney Cox, and Jim Carrey teasing people, being nerdy, obnoxious, calling them ugly, talking with his ass, you almost have the feeling, it's a one-note performance, but it takes some great acting skills to carry one film alone like Carrey does.

Tom Shadyak, who directed "Dumb and Dumber" the same year, directs the film as if he was exaggeratedly taking his viewers for dumb people. But seriously, I don't mind having my intelligence insulted when it's done for humorous purpose, and when it starts being funny, it becomes most intelligent than any traditional gag. Let me explain this better: just because it's Jim Carrey, the movie can get away with everything. Really? Like he would "Re-he-he-he- heaaaally?" (And I laughed at that line, too) So, Ace enters the houses, gives the case and take the kidnapped dog back, the chase scene that follows is so over the top, especially when Ventura finally starts the car and screaming "it's alive", Shadyak gives the final deathblow to any expectation of a "serious comedy" and to the last skeptical minds, you have Ventura's award from the little dog's mistress. What can I say about this part? Well, Mel Brooks said once that "The Producers" 'rose below vulgarity', "Ace Ventura" is probably the comedy that comes the closest to that definition. Indeed, "Ace Ventura" belongs to a special kind of comedies, dumb enough to be funny, without being annoying, and smart enough to  nah, it's not that smart, or maybe it's smart in the way it's funny when it shouldn't normally be. Bad acting? Over-the-top situations? Don't ask me why but in the very context of Ace Ventura, they all work. The plot? The Miami football team's mascot, a dolphin, has been stolen and Ace Ventura must find it, he meets the beautiful Courteney Cox and two of them make a strange pair. We know how it would end between them but then again, it's handled in an over-the-top comical way. It's outrageous, raunchy, but how about when Jim Carrey is looking for one of the ex-football team champions, and has to check if they have a ring in their fingers. At one point, he's looking at one athlete in the toilet with a strange eye, and this is not even the funniest gag. There is one scene where he realized that one person he's just kissed isn't a woman and his reaction is priceless and for very gutsy when you think of it. Some would say it's homophobic but it mocks more the homophobic attitude than homosexuality. And if people can't get that, no wonder they would find the rest of the film unfunny. Dolphins, football, a cruel and tough but beautiful police inspector played by Sean Young, the beautiful Courteney Cox, and Jim Carrey teasing people, being nerdy, obnoxious, calling them ugly, talking with his ass, you almost have the feeling, it's a one-note performance, but it takes some great acting skills to carry one film alone like Carrey does. With "The Mask", "Dumb and Dumber" and "Ace Ventura" (all of them in the Top 10 highest-grossing films), 1994 was the breakthrough year of Jim Carrey, that launched his career and put him in the Hall of Fame of the greatest comedic performers. And you have to give credit to Jim Carrey, especially because he played three different characters  and he's just too damn funny.

    This film is not very good. It's one of those films with Jim Carrey that aren't that funny. Jim Carrey is a weird type of actor.. You see him in Liar Liar and he makes you crack up on the floor laughing and then you see him in this film and others such as Yesman, and you come to question if he really is a funny character or maybe its the scripts that are sometimes badly written :/ anyway back to the film, I didn't like it too much as it wasn't too good. A 6/10 seems the perfect vote because it's not a complete and utter fiasco but it's not that good either. If I were you I wouldn't bother watching this film, unless you are a true Jim Carrey fan and you want to see all movies. x

    I first watched this when it was released on video and I have to say it's one of my favs! Jim Carrey is classic in this, his best movie by far. I have never seen anything like it and probably won't again. It's fresh, the pace is good and the acting by Carrey is very funny. It's light, entertaining and no too serious which means you can tune in and out without really missing much. Everyone who has seen this has loved it and I can't see why you wouldn't. Pet detective 2 is also good but not a touch on this original. If you want a laugh and haven't seen this go and buy it now.

    Undeniably juvenile, but funny and entertaining comedy stars Carreyin his breakthrough roleas a goofy, wildly eccentric pet detective hired to find the missing Miami Dolphins mascot. He's the right man for the job but his childish idiosyncrasies, uncanny bond with animals, and aberrant investigative techniques cause outsiders to question whether or not he can actually make good on his word. Aimed mostly at fans who really enjoy silly humor, others will probably find it lame and tiresome. There are some amusing cameos by real Dolphin football players (including an engaging Dan Marino) but this film belongs to Carrey and his constant outrageousness. Sure-fire entertainment for fans of this genre. **&frac12;

    Pet Detective Ace Ventura (Jim Carrey) is the man you call when crimes happen to animals. When Miami Dolphins' mascot dolphin Snowflake is stolen from its watertank, team official Melissa Robinson (Courteney Cox) must ask Ace Ventura to investigate. Police Lieutenant Lois Einhorn (Sean Young) hates the brash pet detective, but he always seems to be out-think everyone. Jim Carrey has made a virtue of going over the top. And he is extremely virtuous in this movie. He's at his rubbery best playing with animals and talking thru his butt. It's shocking at first. Then it gets cute. Then it gets a bit tired but the movie ends before it became annoying. For some, the movie probably didn't end soon enough. The antics get tiring. It just doesn't end. Although the final reveal is hilarious. The movie is just good enough to be fun.

    Disappointment. It seemed like they got a great cast of actors and the Miami Dolphins pro football team together to make a comedy, then realized that they needed to write a funny script and had writer's block. Jim Carrey is his usual silly goof and his humorist brilliance does show through but the story is rather lame, stupid and painful to watch. The story is also not child friendly as in the opening scene there is a oral sex joke and there is s sprinkling of adult humor throughout the movie. Cringe alert. Parents beware, this is a case of Hollywood being out of touch with the mainstream. Carrey's follow on movies "the Mask" and "Bruce Almighty" are much better but you can't use their success to judge this film. It is just not as good.

    Story/Plot - Ace Ventura (Jim Carrey) is a slightly crazy yet lovable character. He has a love for animals and detection. Ace Ventura is able to think like an animal and also think like a criminal. This giving him the edge over the real police. Starting off by rescuing a stolen dog from a very angry man by posing as a courier right through to then end by rescuing the beloved mascot of an American Football team, a dolphin. Ace is pure comedy and still manages to win the heart of Melissa Robinson (Courteney Cox). My verdict - If you want to spend over an hour laughing your head off and in suspense then I fully recommend you watch Ace Ventura Pet Detective. You will definitely not be disappointed with this film. Outstanding screen play by Jim Carrey who moulds into his character extremely well, he is accompanied by a fine performance by the lovely Courteney Cox, who I must say looks fabulous.

    Ace Ventura is a pet detective. The job is to investigate various missing or abused animals and return them to their rightful owners. His big case is when Miami Dolphins mascot Snowflake (an actual dolphin) get's stolen. Melissa (Courtney Cox) who works with the Dolphins is there to help Ace on the case, and along the way they fall in love. Ace eventually realizes that it is a bitter former player named Ray Finkle who has kidnapped Snowflake, and it's up to him to find Ray and retrieve the mammal before Superbowl Sunday. I liked this one a lot. There are quite a lot of funny moments, one's that stick out are; Ace making a fool of himself at a fancy party for rich people, Ace pretending to be insane at a mental institution, and Ace's various scenes at the police station. I can see why some people might find the character Ace annoying, I started too as it went along. But it is necessary for the character to be obnoxious/loud, and Jim Carrey plays over the top so well. The rest of the actors were good as well including Courtney Cox and Sean Young as "Lois" the police detective with a secret.. I enjoyed the mystery aspect of 'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective', having to first find Ray Finkle and then find out who Ray Finkle really is. Lot's of comedic moments and an interesting plot equals good in my books 7/10

    Ace Ventura: Pet Detective is a comedy film starring Jim Carrey,who plays the title role. It was developed by the film's original writer, Jack Bernstein, and co-producer, Bob Israel. It co-stars Courteney Cox, Tone Lōc, Sean Young and former Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino. Ace Ventura is a low-rent private eye who specializes in recovering lost animals, so when Snowflake, the Miami Dolphins' aquatic mascot, is kidnapped, team representative Melissa Robinson puts Ace on the case. However, Snowflake isn't the only Miami Dolphin who has gone missing; several key members of the team also disappear, including quarterback Dan Marino, who is spirited away while filming a TV commercial. With the Super Bowl only two weeks away, will Ace be able to find Snowflake and the missing athletes in time to salvage the big game? Unlike famous bumbling sleuths such as Inspector Clouseau and Lt. Frank Drebin, there's no consistency to the "Ace" character, and the whole movie shifts in tone from social satire to sophomoric pranks and traditional cop show plotting.But nevertheless,this is a perfect platform for Jim Carrey to showcase his physical comedy skills.

    Coming from nowhere, a hand is grabbing his shoulder, and a voice says in a very ominous tone: "Mr. Ventura?" to which the character of the same name replies: "Yes  (brief pause) Satan?" The chances for such jokes to work only depend on the believability of its lead character even as a comical protagonist, but it's Jim Carrey who carries the film, and for some magical reason, he turns a very wacky script (in a simple-minded way) into a funny, and sometimes hilarious, comedy. Granted it's not the most elegant or sophisticated one, but I liked it, I liked it so much I could watch it again, and still laugh at the lousiest jokes. Now, that's still a tough review to give, because as much as I have the deepest respect for such distinguished critics as Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert, it would be a lie if I said that I didn't laugh at "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective". They're right that the film had a kind of immature appeal and uses a character that plays the same one-note nerdy twisted geek all along; still, it made me laugh. Maybe it's the most primary and raunchy level of humor, maybe I shouldn't even be entitled to judge another film, let alone a comedy, if I was capable to appreciate Tom Shadyak's film. But I guess I would be more to blame if I was pretending not to love it just to look smart. Hell, I don't even know why I'm feeling sorry to love the film, I really do, and too bad some people couldn't laugh at it. "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" is so straightforward in its approach to comedy that it's nearly impossible to find it unfunny. Even when the jokes don't work and actually, I can't think of one (well, I didn't like the performance of the kidnapped athlete but never mind), you have Jim Carrey who saves the day by playing the most obnoxious cinematic character ever. Two things I don't get by the way: how could he ever get a Razzie nomination for his performance and how could Roger Ebert hate the character for what was his most defining characteristic? It's precisely because he was obnoxious that Ace Ventura was funny, think about it, a man who loves animals so much that he hates human. Does it make sense? What's the matter, as long as it makes laugh? And the opening scene of the couldn't have set the tone any better, Ventura carries a sort of fragile bag with such carelessness, any clairvoyant mind would automatically wonder if there is some fragile stuff inside or if it's just an undercover. The whole opening credits consists on showing him mistreating the little case, just in case we forgot that. Tom Shadyak, who directed "Dumb and Dumber" the same year, directs the film as if he was exaggeratedly taking his viewers for dumb people. But seriously, I don't mind having my intelligence insulted when it's done for humorous purpose, and when it starts being funny, it becomes most intelligent than any traditional gag.

They're right that the film had a kind of immature appeal and uses a character that plays the same one-note nerdy twisted geek all along; still, it made me laugh. Maybe it's the most primary and raunchy level of humor, maybe I shouldn't even be entitled to judge another film, let alone a comedy, if I was capable to appreciate Tom Shadyak's film. But I guess I would be more to blame if I was pretending not to love it just to look smart. Hell, I don't even know why I'm feeling sorry to love the film, I really do, and too bad some people couldn't laugh at it. "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" is so straightforward in its approach to comedy that it's nearly impossible to find it unfunny. Even when the jokes don't work and actually, I can't think of one (well, I didn't like the performance of the kidnapped athlete but never mind), you have Jim Carrey who saves the day by playing the most obnoxious cinematic character ever. Two things I don't get by the way: how could he ever get a Razzie nomination for his performance and how could Roger Ebert hate the character for what was his most defining characteristic? It's precisely because he was obnoxious that Ace Ventura was funny, think about it, a man who loves animals so much that he hates human. Does it make sense? What's the matter, as long as it makes laugh? And the opening scene of the couldn't have set the tone any better, Ventura carries a sort of fragile bag with such carelessness, any clairvoyant mind would automatically wonder if there is some fragile stuff inside or if it's just an undercover. The whole opening credits consists on showing him mistreating the little case, just in case we forgot that. Tom Shadyak, who directed "Dumb and Dumber" the same year, directs the film as if he was exaggeratedly taking his viewers for dumb people. But seriously, I don't mind having my intelligence insulted when it's done for humorous purpose, and when it starts being funny, it becomes most intelligent than any traditional gag. Let me explain this better: just because it's Jim Carrey, the movie can get away with everything. Really? Like he would "Re-he-he-he- heaaaally?" (And I laughed at that line, too) So, Ace enters the houses, gives the case and take the kidnapped dog back, the chase scene that follows is so over the top, especially when Ventura finally starts the car and screaming "it's alive", Shadyak gives the final deathblow to any expectation of a "serious comedy" and to the last skeptical minds, you have Ventura's award from the little dog's mistress. What can I say about this part? Well, Mel Brooks said once that "The Producers" 'rose below vulgarity', "Ace Ventura" is probably the comedy that comes the closest to that definition. Indeed, "Ace Ventura" belongs to a special kind of comedies, dumb enough to be funny, without being annoying, and smart enough to  nah, it's not that smart, or maybe it's smart in the way it's funny when it shouldn't normally be. Bad acting? Over-the-top situations? Don't ask me why but in the very context of Ace Ventura, they all work. The plot? The Miami football team's mascot, a dolphin, has been stolen and Ace Ventura must find it, he meets the beautiful Courteney Cox and two of them make a strange pair. We know how it would end between them but then again, it's handled in an over-the-top comical way. It's outrageous, raunchy, but how about when Jim Carrey is looking for one of the ex-football team champions, and has to check if they have a ring in their fingers. At one point, he's looking at one athlete in the toilet with a strange eye, and this is not even the funniest gag. There is one scene where he realized that one person he's just kissed isn't a woman and his reaction is priceless and for very gutsy when you think of it. Some would say it's homophobic but it mocks more the homophobic attitude than homosexuality. And if people can't get that, no wonder they would find the rest of the film unfunny. Dolphins, football, a cruel and tough but beautiful police inspector played by Sean Young, the beautiful Courteney Cox, and Jim Carrey teasing people, being nerdy, obnoxious, calling them ugly, talking with his ass, you almost have the feeling, it's a one-note performance, but it takes some great acting skills to carry one film alone like Carrey does. With "The Mask", "Dumb and Dumber" and "Ace Ventura" (all of them in the Top 10 highest-grossing films), 1994 was the breakthrough year of Jim Carrey, that launched his career and put him in the Hall of Fame of the greatest comedic performers. And you have to give credit to Jim Carrey, especially because he played three different characters  and he's just too damn funny.

    This film is not very good. It's one of those films with Jim Carrey that aren't that funny. Jim Carrey is a weird type of actor.. You see him in Liar Liar and he makes you crack up on the floor laughing and then you see him in this film and others such as Yesman, and you come to question if he really is a funny character or maybe its the scripts that are sometimes badly written :/ anyway back to the film, I didn't like it too much as it wasn't too good. A 6/10 seems the perfect vote because it's not a complete and utter fiasco but it's not that good either. If I were you I wouldn't bother watching this film, unless you are a true Jim Carrey fan and you want to see all movies. x

    I first watched this when it was released on video and I have to say it's one of my favs! Jim Carrey is classic in this, his best movie by far. I have never seen anything like it and probably won't again. It's fresh, the pace is good and the acting by Carrey is very funny. It's light, entertaining and no too serious which means you can tune in and out without really missing much. Everyone who has seen this has loved it and I can't see why you wouldn't. Pet detective 2 is also good but not a touch on this original. If you want a laugh and haven't seen this go and buy it now.

    Undeniably juvenile, but funny and entertaining comedy stars Carreyin his breakthrough roleas a goofy, wildly eccentric pet detective hired to find the missing Miami Dolphins mascot. He's the right man for the job but his childish idiosyncrasies, uncanny bond with animals, and aberrant investigative techniques cause outsiders to question whether or not he can actually make good on his word. Aimed mostly at fans who really enjoy silly humor, others will probably find it lame and tiresome. There are some amusing cameos by real Dolphin football players (including an engaging Dan Marino) but this film belongs to Carrey and his constant outrageousness. Sure-fire entertainment for fans of this genre. **&frac12;

    Pet Detective Ace Ventura (Jim Carrey) is the man you call when crimes happen to animals. When Miami Dolphins' mascot dolphin Snowflake is stolen from its watertank, team official Melissa Robinson (Courteney Cox) must ask Ace Ventura to investigate. Police Lieutenant Lois Einhorn (Sean Young) hates the brash pet detective, but he always seems to be out-think everyone. Jim Carrey has made a virtue of going over the top. And he is extremely virtuous in this movie. He's at his rubbery best playing with animals and talking thru his butt. It's shocking at first. Then it gets cute. Then it gets a bit tired but the movie ends before it became annoying. For some, the movie probably didn't end soon enough. The antics get tiring. It just doesn't end. Although the final reveal is hilarious. The movie is just good enough to be fun.

    Disappointment. It seemed like they got a great cast of actors and the Miami Dolphins pro football team together to make a comedy, then realized that they needed to write a funny script and had writer's block. Jim Carrey is his usual silly goof and his humorist brilliance does show through but the story is rather lame, stupid and painful to watch. The story is also not child friendly as in the opening scene there is a oral sex joke and there is s sprinkling of adult humor throughout the movie. Cringe alert. Parents beware, this is a case of Hollywood being out of touch with the mainstream. Carrey's follow on movies "the Mask" and "Bruce Almighty" are much better but you can't use their success to judge this film. It is just not as good.

    Story/Plot - Ace Ventura (Jim Carrey) is a slightly crazy yet lovable character. He has a love for animals and detection. Ace Ventura is able to think like an animal and also think like a criminal. This giving him the edge over the real police. Starting off by rescuing a stolen dog from a very angry man by posing as a courier right through to then end by rescuing the beloved mascot of an American Football team, a dolphin. Ace is pure comedy and still manages to win the heart of Melissa Robinson (Courteney Cox). My verdict - If you want to spend over an hour laughing your head off and in suspense then I fully recommend you watch Ace Ventura Pet Detective. You will definitely not be disappointed with this film. Outstanding screen play by Jim Carrey who moulds into his character extremely well, he is accompanied by a fine performance by the lovely Courteney Cox, who I must say looks fabulous.

    Ace Ventura is a pet detective. The job is to investigate various missing or abused animals and return them to their rightful owners. His big case is when Miami Dolphins mascot Snowflake (an actual dolphin) get's stolen. Melissa (Courtney Cox) who works with the Dolphins is there to help Ace on the case, and along the way they fall in love. Ace eventually realizes that it is a bitter former player named Ray Finkle who has kidnapped Snowflake, and it's up to him to find Ray and retrieve the mammal before Superbowl Sunday. I liked this one a lot. There are quite a lot of funny moments, one's that stick out are; Ace making a fool of himself at a fancy party for rich people, Ace pretending to be insane at a mental institution, and Ace's various scenes at the police station. I can see why some people might find the character Ace annoying, I started too as it went along. But it is necessary for the character to be obnoxious/loud, and Jim Carrey plays over the top so well. The rest of the actors were good as well including Courtney Cox and Sean Young as "Lois" the police detective with a secret.. I enjoyed the mystery aspect of 'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective', having to first find Ray Finkle and then find out who Ray Finkle really is. Lot's of comedic moments and an interesting plot equals good in my books 7/10

    Ace Ventura: Pet Detective is a comedy film starring Jim Carrey,who plays the title role. It was developed by the film's original writer, Jack Bernstein, and co-producer, Bob Israel. It co-stars Courteney Cox, Tone Lōc, Sean Young and former Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino. Ace Ventura is a low-rent private eye who specializes in recovering lost animals, so when Snowflake, the Miami Dolphins' aquatic mascot, is kidnapped, team representative Melissa Robinson puts Ace on the case. However, Snowflake isn't the only Miami Dolphin who has gone missing; several key members of the team also disappear, including quarterback Dan Marino, who is spirited away while filming a TV commercial. With the Super Bowl only two weeks away, will Ace be able to find Snowflake and the missing athletes in time to salvage the big game? Unlike famous bumbling sleuths such as Inspector Clouseau and Lt. Frank Drebin, there's no consistency to the "Ace" character, and the whole movie shifts in tone from social satire to sophomoric pranks and traditional cop show plotting.But nevertheless,this is a perfect platform for Jim Carrey to showcase his physical comedy skills.

    Coming from nowhere, a hand is grabbing his shoulder, and a voice says in a very ominous tone: "Mr. Ventura?" to which the character of the same name replies: "Yes  (brief pause) Satan?" The chances for such jokes to work only depend on the believability of its lead character even as a comical protagonist, but it's Jim Carrey who carries the film, and for some magical reason, he turns a very wacky script (in a simple-minded way) into a funny, and sometimes hilarious, comedy. Granted it's not the most elegant or sophisticated one, but I liked it, I liked it so much I could watch it again, and still laugh at the lousiest jokes. Now, that's still a tough review to give, because as much as I have the deepest respect for such distinguished critics as Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert, it would be a lie if I said that I didn't laugh at "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective". They're right that the film had a kind of immature appeal and uses a character that plays the same one-note nerdy twisted geek all along; still, it made me laugh.

With the Super Bowl only two weeks away, will Ace be able to find Snowflake and the missing athletes in time to salvage the big game? Unlike famous bumbling sleuths such as Inspector Clouseau and Lt. Frank Drebin, there's no consistency to the "Ace" character, and the whole movie shifts in tone from social satire to sophomoric pranks and traditional cop show plotting.But nevertheless,this is a perfect platform for Jim Carrey to showcase his physical comedy skills.

    Coming from nowhere, a hand is grabbing his shoulder, and a voice says in a very ominous tone: "Mr. Ventura?" to which the character of the same name replies: "Yes  (brief pause) Satan?" The chances for such jokes to work only depend on the believability of its lead character even as a comical protagonist, but it's Jim Carrey who carries the film, and for some magical reason, he turns a very wacky script (in a simple-minded way) into a funny, and sometimes hilarious, comedy. Granted it's not the most elegant or sophisticated one, but I liked it, I liked it so much I could watch it again, and still laugh at the lousiest jokes. Now, that's still a tough review to give, because as much as I have the deepest respect for such distinguished critics as Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert, it would be a lie if I said that I didn't laugh at "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective". They're right that the film had a kind of immature appeal and uses a character that plays the same one-note nerdy twisted geek all along; still, it made me laugh. Maybe it's the most primary and raunchy level of humor, maybe I shouldn't even be entitled to judge another film, let alone a comedy, if I was capable to appreciate Tom Shadyak's film. But I guess I would be more to blame if I was pretending not to love it just to look smart. Hell, I don't even know why I'm feeling sorry to love the film, I really do, and too bad some people couldn't laugh at it. "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" is so straightforward in its approach to comedy that it's nearly impossible to find it unfunny. Even when the jokes don't work and actually, I can't think of one (well, I didn't like the performance of the kidnapped athlete but never mind), you have Jim Carrey who saves the day by playing the most obnoxious cinematic character ever. Two things I don't get by the way: how could he ever get a Razzie nomination for his performance and how could Roger Ebert hate the character for what was his most defining characteristic? It's precisely because he was obnoxious that Ace Ventura was funny, think about it, a man who loves animals so much that he hates human. Does it make sense? What's the matter, as long as it makes laugh? And the opening scene of the couldn't have set the tone any better, Ventura carries a sort of fragile bag with such carelessness, any clairvoyant mind would automatically wonder if there is some fragile stuff inside or if it's just an undercover. The whole opening credits consists on showing him mistreating the little case, just in case we forgot that. Tom Shadyak, who directed "Dumb and Dumber" the same year, directs the film as if he was exaggeratedly taking his viewers for dumb people. But seriously, I don't mind having my intelligence insulted when it's done for humorous purpose, and when it starts being funny, it becomes most intelligent than any traditional gag. Let me explain this better: just because it's Jim Carrey, the movie can get away with everything. Really? Like he would "Re-he-he-he- heaaaally?" (And I laughed at that line, too) So, Ace enters the houses, gives the case and take the kidnapped dog back, the chase scene that follows is so over the top, especially when Ventura finally starts the car and screaming "it's alive", Shadyak gives the final deathblow to any expectation of a "serious comedy" and to the last skeptical minds, you have Ventura's award from the little dog's mistress. What can I say about this part? Well, Mel Brooks said once that "The Producers" 'rose below vulgarity', "Ace Ventura" is probably the comedy that comes the closest to that definition. Indeed, "Ace Ventura" belongs to a special kind of comedies, dumb enough to be funny, without being annoying, and smart enough to  nah, it's not that smart, or maybe it's smart in the way it's funny when it shouldn't normally be. Bad acting? Over-the-top situations? Don't ask me why but in the very context of Ace Ventura, they all work. The plot? The Miami football team's mascot, a dolphin, has been stolen and Ace Ventura must find it, he meets the beautiful Courteney Cox and two of them make a strange pair. We know how it would end between them but then again, it's handled in an over-the-top comical way. It's outrageous, raunchy, but how about when Jim Carrey is looking for one of the ex-football team champions, and has to check if they have a ring in their fingers. At one point, he's looking at one athlete in the toilet with a strange eye, and this is not even the funniest gag. There is one scene where he realized that one person he's just kissed isn't a woman and his reaction is priceless and for very gutsy when you think of it. Some would say it's homophobic but it mocks more the homophobic attitude than homosexuality. And if people can't get that, no wonder they would find the rest of the film unfunny. Dolphins, football, a cruel and tough but beautiful police inspector played by Sean Young, the beautiful Courteney Cox, and Jim Carrey teasing people, being nerdy, obnoxious, calling them ugly, talking with his ass, you almost have the feeling, it's a one-note performance, but it takes some great acting skills to carry one film alone like Carrey does. With "The Mask", "Dumb and Dumber" and "Ace Ventura" (all of them in the Top 10 highest-grossing films), 1994 was the breakthrough year of Jim Carrey, that launched his career and put him in the Hall of Fame of the greatest comedic performers. And you have to give credit to Jim Carrey, especially because he played three different characters  and he's just too damn funny.

    This film is not very good. It's one of those films with Jim Carrey that aren't that funny. Jim Carrey is a weird type of actor.. You see him in Liar Liar and he makes you crack up on the floor laughing and then you see him in this film and others such as Yesman, and you come to question if he really is a funny character or maybe its the scripts that are sometimes badly written :/ anyway back to the film, I didn't like it too much as it wasn't too good. A 6/10 seems the perfect vote because it's not a complete and utter fiasco but it's not that good either. If I were you I wouldn't bother watching this film, unless you are a true Jim Carrey fan and you want to see all movies. x

    I first watched this when it was released on video and I have to say it's one of my favs! Jim Carrey is classic in this, his best movie by far. I have never seen anything like it and probably won't again. It's fresh, the pace is good and the acting by Carrey is very funny. It's light, entertaining and no too serious which means you can tune in and out without really missing much. Everyone who has seen this has loved it and I can't see why you wouldn't. Pet detective 2 is also good but not a touch on this original. If you want a laugh and haven't seen this go and buy it now.

    Undeniably juvenile, but funny and entertaining comedy stars Carreyin his breakthrough roleas a goofy, wildly eccentric pet detective hired to find the missing Miami Dolphins mascot. He's the right man for the job but his childish idiosyncrasies, uncanny bond with animals, and aberrant investigative techniques cause outsiders to question whether or not he can actually make good on his word. Aimed mostly at fans who really enjoy silly humor, others will probably find it lame and tiresome. There are some amusing cameos by real Dolphin football players (including an engaging Dan Marino) but this film belongs to Carrey and his constant outrageousness. Sure-fire entertainment for fans of this genre. **&frac12;
