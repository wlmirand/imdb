    The plot is fine. There are fun elements and the story is complete, though there are not really any big surprises. For those of you who do not know, this is a film about a weak kid who gets bullied at school and he encounters a robot suit from outer space that he can fit into and become "strong". The acting is fine. Both the young and the adult actors delivered fine performances. The special effects look quite cheap. It is probably a problem originated from the budget. It gets more and more boring towards the end, and the climax is not at all rewarding. The ending is far too cheesy. The look of the robot does not really impress me. It is sort of creepy for me. I would go with better design. Still, it is a good family film for a Sunday afternoon if all you are looking forward to is some robot fun and nothing more. I am sure this film has done enough to impress the kids. 4/10 - Fine

    Joseph Mazzello. I like him very much. That is why I wanted to see this film, even though the plot wasn't especially promising. This isn't one of Joseph's best films. It is okay but quite flawed. No less true is that, without our idol Joseph, it would have been a lot worse. He takes the whole movie alone. The movie only works because of him. As usual, Joseph is wonderful on his part. The only strange and minor side of his acting here is that he spends a great deal of time inside a cybersuit. Nothing wrong with his acting, it's just that spending such a great amount of time inside of a cybersuit is a limitation that prevents him from doing other things he could do, even though he still goes far on this role despite the limitations implied. He's got some hilarious lines and he does some pretty funny faces as well (always so convincing and expressive). The things Spencer (Joseph's character) does in this movie with Cy (the cybersuit)... I bet this is how little Bobby from 'Radio Flyer' would have liked to make his brutal stepfather "The King" pay for everything he did to him. It's a fun film to watch, original and imaginative. Yes, it's silly, but worthy for Joseph Mazzello's fans precisely thanks to him.

    This bomb looks like it was filmed in 1987, not 1997. It combines clich&eacute;s from every 80s teen, sci-fi flick you can remember, and regurgitates them in the most annoying manner possible. What a step down for the kid actor from "Jurassic Park" - this really is absolute junk. I'm not surprised the director is responsible for producing "Enterprise" (worst of the "Trek" series), and season six of "24" - by far its weakest. To make matters worse, the script at one point actually has the main "characters" listening to scenes from "Lost in Space" - the wonderfully hokey TV series that looks like Shakespeare, compared to "Star Kid." Children deserve better than this. Yeah, they'll watch anything - so it's up to you parents to provide a little discretion. Rent "Flight of the Navigator," instead - a GOOD 80s kid's sci-fi movie.

    I got to admit I enjoyed STAR KID. The story works, the characters work, the monsters work. Everything basically works for this movie. I love the Cyborsuit, he is a clever character. The whole premise almost reminds me of FLIGHT OF THE NAVIGATOR a few years back. But not much. This is a fun movie that the whole family can get into, there plenty of action, humor and warmth so even Mom can like this movie. The guys will like all the cool alien monsters both good and bad. Now some of the dialog was weak at points and I think they spent to much time on Spencer before the Cyborsuit arrived. But other then that I think this is a fun flick that you can watch over and over again. 9 STARS.

    This movie is about a kid who discovers a cybersuit after seeing a meteor crash in the local junkyard. After getting to know the AI inside the suit itself, he discovers the two battling alien races, and encounters one of the Brood Warriors so seeks to destroy earth. Armed with alien technology, Earth's defense rests on the shoulders on a single kid, and with the help of some unexpected allies, he manages to claim victory over the brood warrior, and saves Earth from future invasion. I'm personally shocked to see it got such a low rating. Awesome replay value if you like to watch movies over and over again. 10/10.

    This is a kids' movie to watch if you are bored. It's entertaining in some parts, but normally to enjoy this, you'd probably have to be under ten. For kid actors, the acting isn't that bad - it's just the storyline. Very average.

    Although the film does have great special effects and a fast-pace, the film does tend to become a standard fair. The characters are boring, and the script is weak, but it is still fun and has great effects. (***)

    I remember seeing the preview to "Star Kid" when it came out in theaters and thinking, "Man, does that look dumb." Last night it came on one of the movie channels--at 10pm, strangely--so I figured I'd let it play in the background while I did some work. I ended up watching the whole thing, and guess what--I really enjoyed it. Sure, there are some inevitably silly scenes, but then, at 37, I'm way out of the target demographic. I don't want to find fault with the movie because "it is what it is." The actors are all decent, the effects are better than I had expected, and best of all, it has heart. I'm building a library of movies for our kids (when we finally have some), and said movies will need to be wholesome family entertainment that I won't mind watching, too. I will definitely include "Star Kid."

    12-year-old Spencer Griffith (Joseph Mazzelllo)is an intelligent introveterted kid, who's life couldn't get much worse. His beloved mom died a few years earlier, his dad ignores him,his sister is a jerk to him, and he's a "dweeb" at school. Spencer gets picked on and beat on at school by his school nemesis a couple years older than him, "Turbo", and he's too shy to talk to Michelle, the cute girl in school.His only escape is reading the comic book "Midnight Warrior" Salvation is on its way! When Spencer is at home alone, because his boy crazy sister goes out with her boyfriend (Danny Masterson from That 70's Show), a cybersuit lands in the junkyard, which he jumps into and names cy,short for "cybersuit" and teaches it human language, becomes it's friend, and gets revenge on Turbo, by scaring the crap out of him! Later he learns that broodwariors have come to destroy the earth, and it's up to the runty kid and Turbo, who becomes his friend to stop them. I loved seeing Joseph Mazzello be a superhero like figure, he was my favorite young actor, and he's usually in Hard hitting dramas that are often depressing, and didn't get much attention or scene steeling moments in the action films he was in.

    This is an ok movie. It shows on the Disney Channel a lot, and usually it is just on in the background, or I am watching it but not really paying attention. I have watched it from start to finish though, and it is ... well, mediocre. I guess if you like sci-fi type movies, you might give it an 8 or 9. Me? It deserves a 6.
