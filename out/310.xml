    My problems with it include the overall sappy tone, which marred Matt Damon's otherwise good performance as a rookie lawyer with a Southern twang. It was amusing to see him struggle, and Danny DeVito's character seemed to drive the picture. The plot was on the weak side of things, and it was tame for a John Grisham story. I was also expecting more out of Coppola post-Godfather. I'm glad that the good guys win and everybody feels better once the evil insurance company goes bankrupt. It was heartwarming, but I was expecting more intrigue and suspense. When it didn't come, it made Rudy's narration unnecessary and irritating. Danny Glover felt miscast as the judge, and Jon Voight wasn't allowed much time to shine. I was expecting an intense scene between him and Damon once the lawsuit intensified. The romance felt superfluous because the scenes with the Black family and the old lady show that Rudy cares about people. It was time better suited for conspiracy and chaos, especially since it all seems pointless as the wife gets spared by the DA. Rudy's buddies kept telling him to be careful, but I was left asking why because the bad guys only seemed to care about winning the case as opposed to escalating things with violence like any other Grisham story I've seen. I initially thought Bruiser (Mickey Rourke) would be the antagonist with something to hide, and frankly he was more intimidating and interesting than Great Benefit Insurance. However, it was still enjoyable. I would give it a 7 out of 10.

    This one gets three stars because the formula works to some extent every time. But clearly there is a story to tell behind this movie. FFC took this one on as a hired gun. His script is limp - one of the worst closing arguments in the history of courtroom drama. The script is credited to FFC with "narration" by a third party. The over-dubbing of dialog and the addition of a pointless narration, the half-told subplots and the rearrangement of events in the book all point to a desperate resuscitation attempt in post. I am amazed they kept Elmer Bernstein's music, which makes you feel like you are watching an episode of Mannix. And why is Danny Glover uncredited, when he has a major role? I love Coppola's movies, but his heart clearly was not in this one.

    Unless you have read John Grisham's novel, you probably will not enjoy the film adaption of The Rainmaker, which is as slow and boring as courtroom dramas come. Perhaps the only redeeming aspect is the talents of Danny DeVito, cast as Rudy's ever-scheming partner, Deck. The most frustrating aspect of the film is that the characters are all cast properly, but the actors did not reach their full potential due to sloppy editing and an incredibly slow-paced plot. Granted, this is a courtroom drama, not an action movie, but the plot is so fragmented that it's hard to stay focused on the Great Benefits Insurance case. Although true to the book, the Miss Birdie and forbidden love subplots bog down the film with slow, uneventful scenes that do little to challenge Rudy's beliefs and substantially strengthen him as a character. If you've read the book, then you may enjoy this adaption for what it's worth--namely, DeVito's acting and a few lawyer jokes to pocket for later. http://bitesizemoviereview.blogspot.com/

    Having recently graduated from law school at the University of Memphis and unable to find lucrative employment, an earnest, idealistic young lawyer (Damon) begins working for a ruthless ambulance chaser (Rourke), then finds himself going head-to-head with an unscrupulous insurance company and its smarmy, overpaid legal defense team (led by Voight) after they failed to pay a claim for a young man diagnosed with leukemia. At the same time, the lawyer finds some degree of solace by becoming the unofficial "protector" of a battered woman (Danes). Superbly cast, with pitch-perfect performances, sure-handed direction, and good, intelligent storytelling. A bit on the long side, but still a well-made and respectable adaptation of John Grisham's novel. ***

    Francis Ford Coppola is both scriptwriter and director of this film entitled,The Rainmaker. It was adapted from the John Grisham novel about broke, inexperienced Memphis law-school graduate Rudy Baylor.It stars Matt Damon as Rudy Baylor together with an ensemble cast namely: Danny DeVito, Danny Glover, Claire Danes, Jon Voight, Roy Scheider, Mickey Rourke, Virginia Madsen,Mary Kay Place and Teresa Wright in her final film. Rudy Baylor, ready to take any job he can find. Signing on with slimy Bruiser Stone, he learns ambulance-chasing tactics from Bruiser's leg man Deck Schifflet and meets battered teen Kelly Riker (Claire Danes), abused by her husband. Baylor has his own clients -- friendly Miss Birdie, who has a large estate to dispose of, and desperate Dot Black, whose son Donnie Ray has terminal leukemia. Medical intervention could have spared his life, but the Great Benefit Insurance Company denied coverage, preventing Donnie Ray from getting a life-saving bone marrow transplant. Rudy finds a place to live in the apartment behind Miss Birdie's house. Deck and Rudy split from Bruiser to start their small firm. When they take on the Blacks' case, they go up against the insurance company's high-priced law firm and are continually thwarted by slick lawyer Leo F. Drummond. Coppola has infused The Rainmaker with enough humor, character, honest emotion and storytelling style to make it a very entertaining movie.Aside from that,the story is characterized with intelligence and subtlety that makes it interesting from beginning to end.Aside from that,the cast performed very well.Special mention should be given to Jon Voight and Danny DeVito. While Matt Damon did certainly provide great acting as the young Rudy Baylor. This legal drama is definitely one of the best that Grisham has ever written and Coppola has ever filmed.

    I firmly believe in this statement since: how come an truly and realistic great film with an excellent cast, directed by one of the most respected film directors of all time, is barely mentioned by people, almost unknown to many film viewers and also (as for my country) never shown on TV? It was released in theaters here but for a short time. I've never heard of this film being on regular TV and not even in cable TV, and the closer I get of this film was seeing the DVD somewhere, and unfortunately I haven't bought it. And to found it on the internet was even the hardest task ever but it's certainly rewarding. I'm not much into conspiracy theories but I really think someone's hiding this film from viewers. Who could it be? Maybe Paramount itself, company that distributes this film isn't much interested in making it more available for exhibitions or selling. But the danger of "The Rainmaker" lies in a story about bringing risky and millionaire lawsuits against health insurance companies, and (here comes the conspiracy theory which I was referring), but maybe the real companies are paying Paramount to hide this film in the best possible way. The film remains criminally underrated despite having some favorable things about it. In "The Rainmaker", Matt Damon plays Rudy Baylor, an promising and idealistic young lawyer, graduated from Harvard, trying his way into the law business working in a revolting case against Great Benefit, an health insurance company that denied an bone marrow transplant of Donny Ray, a young man dying of leukemia, something that was covered in their policy. Baylor's test is not only in this trial, fighting against Leo F. Drummond (an impeccable and inspiring Jon Voight) and his team of lawyers defending Great Benefit but also in dealing with his boss (Mickey Rourke), involved in some illicit business; with his partner Deck (Danny DeVito) who'll be of great help in bringing testimonies for his case and showing how justice and law really works outside of what law schools teach; and a semi-romantic affair he has with Kelly (Claire Danes), victim of an abusive husband he mets. And believe me, the film never slows down its rhythm at any of these segments, they're all interesting. It's a story about a man fighting for what he believes in a troubled, dangerous, greedy and unethical world but he also needs to make some tricks in order to survive in this same world. His first client before Donny Ray's family is a guy involved in car accidents and who don't have a lawyer to represent them in legal assistance (but it's not something Rudy gets proud of). Rudy is also counts with luck to get things done, I mean, who could have thought that the original Judge selected for this case (and not much friendly with Rudy and his case) would collapse and die, being substituted by a more correct and friendly Judge (Danny Glover)? Like I said, all the segments were interestingly well made but the one that really captures all of our attention (and this is a must when it comes in films like these) is the whole trial. Here's an exciting, electrifying trial and obviously there's surprises (the appearance of a key witness, played by Virginia Madsen), twists and turns, some funny moments and the most interesting aspect of all, it shows how the legal system works, it digs deep into tiny little things that can make a huge difference between winning and losing a court battle. Despite this being directed by Francis Ford Coppola, in one of his attempts to pay for all the costs of the troubled and overbugeted "One From the Heart", which might sound like an film made for giving return in box-office less than being an intelligent and artistic film, "The Rainmaker" contains countless characteristics of his skillful direction, it's filmed and edited in a great style (one of those things that when you look back and watch the films made in the 1990's and then look at the ones made now, you feel the nostalgic feeling that, somehow, the films back then were better and this is a great example of that), followed by a nice soundtrack, and of course, the gigantic group of talented actors present here which also includes small appearances of Roy Scheider, Theresa Wright and Dean Stockwell, all in very good roles. Based on a John Grisham novel (he considers this his favorite film of all film adaptations of his work), this courtroom thriller is brilliantly memorable and it has one of the most original and realistic endings ever presented in films like these, it might look like an obvious clich&eacute; but then you have to wait to see more of what's about to come. Find this movie if you can and watch it right away. 10/10

    Very surprised this move ranked so low. It has a stellar cast, an interesting plot and some witty dialogue. Perhaps the subject matter is too "left of centre" for some, skewing votes lower? Matt Damon plays the young, inexperienced lawyer with a conscience very well. John Voight is equally adept as the big time corporate lawyer who's sold his soul to protect the interests of a multi-million dollar insurance company. The company is sued by a small, poor family whose son is dying of leukaemia and is denied insurance by the big bad company despite having a policy. Intertwined with that plot line is one where Damon becomes too involved with a battered wife and ends up rescuing her from her abusive husband. Movie is very well acted. The storyline flows but not too fast. It takes on the character of a slow southern drawl which is perfect since that is where it is set. 8/10.

    Rudy Baylor is a greenhorn lawyer in Memphis who lands a sensational case - a young man dying of leukaemia whose insurance company refuses to pay out. Can inexperienced Rudy take on the fat cat corporate sharks and dish out some justice ? This is a polished, well made, well acted courtroom drama from a bestselling novel by John Grisham, whose legal thrillers were very popular in the nineties (The Firm, The Pelican Brief, The Client). I'm afraid however I don't think much of the plot - greedy insurance company versus terminally ill kid coughing up blood is a bit too hackneyed for me, and when it throws in fisticuffs with the jury, company documents with mysterious missing bits, and last minute witnesses having affairs with the defendants, my Credibility Proximity Warning lights start to flash. It also has a lengthy subplot involving a battered wife which is touching but has precisely zero relevance. In my view, stories should be tight, focused and original, and I'm not convinced Grisham's are. That said the characters are rich and the drama has some good points to make about the legal exploitation of the US working class, as well as many funny scenes, like the one where DeVito walks down to the hospital and presses his card into the hands of patients in traction. Its strongest suit is the cast - Damon is suitably bewildered and well-intentioned, DeVito holds everything together as the shyster evidence man, Voight is toothy and evil as the corporate pit bull, an unbilled Glover is the judge, Madsen (Dune, Candyman) has an eye-catching part as a bitter and sullied ex-executive, the late great Scheider shows up at the end as the CEO, and Coppola alumni Rourke and Stockwell shine in off-the-wall parts as a mumbling one-step-away-from-prison legal embezzler and a bad-tempered emphysemic judge with a very short life expectancy respectively. The batty old bird is played by Teresa Wright, the young star of several forties classics (such as Hitchcock's Shadow Of A Doubt), aged seventy-seven and making her final film, and West in the small part of the Dad shows how it's possible to create a thought-provoking and fully-fledged character with literally no dialogue. They're all fun to watch strutting their stuff and riffing off each other. In the end though, this is a disappointing movie for me, purely because its scope falls well short of its director's talent. It's a good movie, but it's a safe movie - it looks familiar, it makes you smile and gasp at all the right points, and the heroes win. What makes Coppola's movies great is when he doesn't make them safe. Most people would say this is a better film than One From The Heart, but not me - while that movie may have its flaws too, it's completely original and unlike anything else; it's an artist putting himself on the line (and in that instance getting savaged for it) but injecting his soul into his art. The Rainmaker is a solid bet, an agreeable thriller, but unlike its director it's nothing special.

    It starts out well enough, with a finely orchestrated first hour during which we are introduced to some genuinely compelling characters, including an impressively subdued but very potent Mickey Rourke as Bruiser Stone, the flashy first boss of newly minted kid lawyer Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon), and an extremely vibrant Danny DeVito as a less than virtuous but endearing lawyer wanna-be, Deck Shifflet. There are tender and poignant performances by supporting players, such as Johnny Whitworth as the leukemia stricken Donny Ray Black. The role of Donny's mother is finely handled by Mary Kay Place, her naturally blithe spirit suppressed in a character of considerable depth and subtle inflection. Claire Danes as Kelly Riker, a stoic victim of domestic abuse, proves herself equal to any other working actress. Rudy's non-relationship with Kelly only magnifies the immensity of the good boy's complete total awesomeness. Eventually the increasingly manipulative story wears itself out, the mounting heap of standard court room drama clich&eacute;s just too expansive an obstacle for me to navigate. This film had pretty much drained all my accounts by the 90 minute mark, but there were still another 45 minutes of bilking, such as the appearance of a key witness whose insider information threatens to incriminate the evil large corporation. Virgina Madsen is convincing in the part, but her fine contribution is undermined by the film's insistently maudlin tactics. No sooner had she delivered her moving testimony - count to four - and the poor girl is exposed as the scornful rejected lover of the nasty company man. Her character is further impugned by her own admission that she traded sex for corporate privilege, but only because it was demanded of her. Even a perfectly green, wet behind the ears, newbie lawyer would have sense enough to thoroughly check out a star witness' background, and if not Rudy, than certainly the crafty Deck Shifflet. But Rudy's improbable incompetence was already established in his first appearance before a judge where he didn't have the single slightest clue of courtroom procedure, despite 3 or 4 years of law school experience. Oh right, it was a modest, second rate, non Ivy League school. Maybe the school advertised on the back of match books? If Danny Glover as the mercifully decent replacement judge can't win me back into the film's corner, then maybe a comically sweatered Roy Sheider can. He's a dependable source of fine drama, but his minor bit is too little too late to save this con job that doesn't even have sense enough to end when its over. It just keeps plodding on and on, tripping over at least two or three endings before it finally trickles out, collapsed under its own ponderous weight. I don't know who to despise more - me for having allowed myself to be roped into this tedious swindle, or the shameless driver of this fraudulent car wreck. Remind me again just who is its two-faced, fork-tongued shyster director?!

    Lawyer movies are only worth watching if they are well done, and The Rainmaker is one of those movies. Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon) is a young lawyer straight out of law school and desperate for work. While learning the legal ropes under a crooked lawyer, Bruiser Stone (Mickey Rourke), Rudy takes on the case of Donny Ray Black (Johnny Whitworth) a young boy stricken with leukemia and his medical claims denied by his insurance company. What follows is a typical case of the little guy vs. big corporate greed, but what makes the story watchable and not clich&eacute; is the wonderful cast and acting. The players include John Voight as the sleazy corporate lawyer, Dean Stockwell as the corrupt judge in the pocket of the corporate world, Danny DeVito as Matt Damon's legal assistant/would be lawyer that can't seem to pass the bar exam, and Danny Glover as the anti-corporate judge whose rulings help Matt Damon bring the case to trial. The movie does a good job of presenting the ebb and flow of the case, he audience's opinion of guilt or innocence sways with each new witness and legal maneuver, until the final bombshell is dropped and the case is easily decided. To sum it up, the story is a bit clich&eacute; yet well told, the characters are similarly clich&eacute; yet well acted, and the ending is typical of Hollywood yet rewarding. In all The Rainmaker is a textbook example of a formula movie where attention to detail, characters, and plot make it better than it really is.

Drummond (an impeccable and inspiring Jon Voight) and his team of lawyers defending Great Benefit but also in dealing with his boss (Mickey Rourke), involved in some illicit business; with his partner Deck (Danny DeVito) who'll be of great help in bringing testimonies for his case and showing how justice and law really works outside of what law schools teach; and a semi-romantic affair he has with Kelly (Claire Danes), victim of an abusive husband he mets. And believe me, the film never slows down its rhythm at any of these segments, they're all interesting. It's a story about a man fighting for what he believes in a troubled, dangerous, greedy and unethical world but he also needs to make some tricks in order to survive in this same world. His first client before Donny Ray's family is a guy involved in car accidents and who don't have a lawyer to represent them in legal assistance (but it's not something Rudy gets proud of). Rudy is also counts with luck to get things done, I mean, who could have thought that the original Judge selected for this case (and not much friendly with Rudy and his case) would collapse and die, being substituted by a more correct and friendly Judge (Danny Glover)? Like I said, all the segments were interestingly well made but the one that really captures all of our attention (and this is a must when it comes in films like these) is the whole trial. Here's an exciting, electrifying trial and obviously there's surprises (the appearance of a key witness, played by Virginia Madsen), twists and turns, some funny moments and the most interesting aspect of all, it shows how the legal system works, it digs deep into tiny little things that can make a huge difference between winning and losing a court battle. Despite this being directed by Francis Ford Coppola, in one of his attempts to pay for all the costs of the troubled and overbugeted "One From the Heart", which might sound like an film made for giving return in box-office less than being an intelligent and artistic film, "The Rainmaker" contains countless characteristics of his skillful direction, it's filmed and edited in a great style (one of those things that when you look back and watch the films made in the 1990's and then look at the ones made now, you feel the nostalgic feeling that, somehow, the films back then were better and this is a great example of that), followed by a nice soundtrack, and of course, the gigantic group of talented actors present here which also includes small appearances of Roy Scheider, Theresa Wright and Dean Stockwell, all in very good roles. Based on a John Grisham novel (he considers this his favorite film of all film adaptations of his work), this courtroom thriller is brilliantly memorable and it has one of the most original and realistic endings ever presented in films like these, it might look like an obvious clich&eacute; but then you have to wait to see more of what's about to come. Find this movie if you can and watch it right away. 10/10

    Very surprised this move ranked so low. It has a stellar cast, an interesting plot and some witty dialogue. Perhaps the subject matter is too "left of centre" for some, skewing votes lower? Matt Damon plays the young, inexperienced lawyer with a conscience very well. John Voight is equally adept as the big time corporate lawyer who's sold his soul to protect the interests of a multi-million dollar insurance company. The company is sued by a small, poor family whose son is dying of leukaemia and is denied insurance by the big bad company despite having a policy. Intertwined with that plot line is one where Damon becomes too involved with a battered wife and ends up rescuing her from her abusive husband. Movie is very well acted. The storyline flows but not too fast. It takes on the character of a slow southern drawl which is perfect since that is where it is set. 8/10.

    Rudy Baylor is a greenhorn lawyer in Memphis who lands a sensational case - a young man dying of leukaemia whose insurance company refuses to pay out. Can inexperienced Rudy take on the fat cat corporate sharks and dish out some justice ? This is a polished, well made, well acted courtroom drama from a bestselling novel by John Grisham, whose legal thrillers were very popular in the nineties (The Firm, The Pelican Brief, The Client). I'm afraid however I don't think much of the plot - greedy insurance company versus terminally ill kid coughing up blood is a bit too hackneyed for me, and when it throws in fisticuffs with the jury, company documents with mysterious missing bits, and last minute witnesses having affairs with the defendants, my Credibility Proximity Warning lights start to flash. It also has a lengthy subplot involving a battered wife which is touching but has precisely zero relevance. In my view, stories should be tight, focused and original, and I'm not convinced Grisham's are. That said the characters are rich and the drama has some good points to make about the legal exploitation of the US working class, as well as many funny scenes, like the one where DeVito walks down to the hospital and presses his card into the hands of patients in traction. Its strongest suit is the cast - Damon is suitably bewildered and well-intentioned, DeVito holds everything together as the shyster evidence man, Voight is toothy and evil as the corporate pit bull, an unbilled Glover is the judge, Madsen (Dune, Candyman) has an eye-catching part as a bitter and sullied ex-executive, the late great Scheider shows up at the end as the CEO, and Coppola alumni Rourke and Stockwell shine in off-the-wall parts as a mumbling one-step-away-from-prison legal embezzler and a bad-tempered emphysemic judge with a very short life expectancy respectively. The batty old bird is played by Teresa Wright, the young star of several forties classics (such as Hitchcock's Shadow Of A Doubt), aged seventy-seven and making her final film, and West in the small part of the Dad shows how it's possible to create a thought-provoking and fully-fledged character with literally no dialogue. They're all fun to watch strutting their stuff and riffing off each other. In the end though, this is a disappointing movie for me, purely because its scope falls well short of its director's talent. It's a good movie, but it's a safe movie - it looks familiar, it makes you smile and gasp at all the right points, and the heroes win. What makes Coppola's movies great is when he doesn't make them safe. Most people would say this is a better film than One From The Heart, but not me - while that movie may have its flaws too, it's completely original and unlike anything else; it's an artist putting himself on the line (and in that instance getting savaged for it) but injecting his soul into his art. The Rainmaker is a solid bet, an agreeable thriller, but unlike its director it's nothing special.

    It starts out well enough, with a finely orchestrated first hour during which we are introduced to some genuinely compelling characters, including an impressively subdued but very potent Mickey Rourke as Bruiser Stone, the flashy first boss of newly minted kid lawyer Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon), and an extremely vibrant Danny DeVito as a less than virtuous but endearing lawyer wanna-be, Deck Shifflet. There are tender and poignant performances by supporting players, such as Johnny Whitworth as the leukemia stricken Donny Ray Black. The role of Donny's mother is finely handled by Mary Kay Place, her naturally blithe spirit suppressed in a character of considerable depth and subtle inflection. Claire Danes as Kelly Riker, a stoic victim of domestic abuse, proves herself equal to any other working actress. Rudy's non-relationship with Kelly only magnifies the immensity of the good boy's complete total awesomeness. Eventually the increasingly manipulative story wears itself out, the mounting heap of standard court room drama clich&eacute;s just too expansive an obstacle for me to navigate. This film had pretty much drained all my accounts by the 90 minute mark, but there were still another 45 minutes of bilking, such as the appearance of a key witness whose insider information threatens to incriminate the evil large corporation. Virgina Madsen is convincing in the part, but her fine contribution is undermined by the film's insistently maudlin tactics. No sooner had she delivered her moving testimony - count to four - and the poor girl is exposed as the scornful rejected lover of the nasty company man. Her character is further impugned by her own admission that she traded sex for corporate privilege, but only because it was demanded of her. Even a perfectly green, wet behind the ears, newbie lawyer would have sense enough to thoroughly check out a star witness' background, and if not Rudy, than certainly the crafty Deck Shifflet. But Rudy's improbable incompetence was already established in his first appearance before a judge where he didn't have the single slightest clue of courtroom procedure, despite 3 or 4 years of law school experience. Oh right, it was a modest, second rate, non Ivy League school. Maybe the school advertised on the back of match books? If Danny Glover as the mercifully decent replacement judge can't win me back into the film's corner, then maybe a comically sweatered Roy Sheider can. He's a dependable source of fine drama, but his minor bit is too little too late to save this con job that doesn't even have sense enough to end when its over. It just keeps plodding on and on, tripping over at least two or three endings before it finally trickles out, collapsed under its own ponderous weight. I don't know who to despise more - me for having allowed myself to be roped into this tedious swindle, or the shameless driver of this fraudulent car wreck. Remind me again just who is its two-faced, fork-tongued shyster director?!

    Lawyer movies are only worth watching if they are well done, and The Rainmaker is one of those movies. Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon) is a young lawyer straight out of law school and desperate for work. While learning the legal ropes under a crooked lawyer, Bruiser Stone (Mickey Rourke), Rudy takes on the case of Donny Ray Black (Johnny Whitworth) a young boy stricken with leukemia and his medical claims denied by his insurance company. What follows is a typical case of the little guy vs. big corporate greed, but what makes the story watchable and not clich&eacute; is the wonderful cast and acting. The players include John Voight as the sleazy corporate lawyer, Dean Stockwell as the corrupt judge in the pocket of the corporate world, Danny DeVito as Matt Damon's legal assistant/would be lawyer that can't seem to pass the bar exam, and Danny Glover as the anti-corporate judge whose rulings help Matt Damon bring the case to trial. The movie does a good job of presenting the ebb and flow of the case, he audience's opinion of guilt or innocence sways with each new witness and legal maneuver, until the final bombshell is dropped and the case is easily decided. To sum it up, the story is a bit clich&eacute; yet well told, the characters are similarly clich&eacute; yet well acted, and the ending is typical of Hollywood yet rewarding. In all The Rainmaker is a textbook example of a formula movie where attention to detail, characters, and plot make it better than it really is.

    My problems with it include the overall sappy tone, which marred Matt Damon's otherwise good performance as a rookie lawyer with a Southern twang. It was amusing to see him struggle, and Danny DeVito's character seemed to drive the picture. The plot was on the weak side of things, and it was tame for a John Grisham story. I was also expecting more out of Coppola post-Godfather. I'm glad that the good guys win and everybody feels better once the evil insurance company goes bankrupt. It was heartwarming, but I was expecting more intrigue and suspense. When it didn't come, it made Rudy's narration unnecessary and irritating. Danny Glover felt miscast as the judge, and Jon Voight wasn't allowed much time to shine. I was expecting an intense scene between him and Damon once the lawsuit intensified. The romance felt superfluous because the scenes with the Black family and the old lady show that Rudy cares about people. It was time better suited for conspiracy and chaos, especially since it all seems pointless as the wife gets spared by the DA. Rudy's buddies kept telling him to be careful, but I was left asking why because the bad guys only seemed to care about winning the case as opposed to escalating things with violence like any other Grisham story I've seen. I initially thought Bruiser (Mickey Rourke) would be the antagonist with something to hide, and frankly he was more intimidating and interesting than Great Benefit Insurance. However, it was still enjoyable. I would give it a 7 out of 10.

    This one gets three stars because the formula works to some extent every time. But clearly there is a story to tell behind this movie. FFC took this one on as a hired gun. His script is limp - one of the worst closing arguments in the history of courtroom drama. The script is credited to FFC with "narration" by a third party. The over-dubbing of dialog and the addition of a pointless narration, the half-told subplots and the rearrangement of events in the book all point to a desperate resuscitation attempt in post. I am amazed they kept Elmer Bernstein's music, which makes you feel like you are watching an episode of Mannix. And why is Danny Glover uncredited, when he has a major role? I love Coppola's movies, but his heart clearly was not in this one.

    Unless you have read John Grisham's novel, you probably will not enjoy the film adaption of The Rainmaker, which is as slow and boring as courtroom dramas come. Perhaps the only redeeming aspect is the talents of Danny DeVito, cast as Rudy's ever-scheming partner, Deck. The most frustrating aspect of the film is that the characters are all cast properly, but the actors did not reach their full potential due to sloppy editing and an incredibly slow-paced plot. Granted, this is a courtroom drama, not an action movie, but the plot is so fragmented that it's hard to stay focused on the Great Benefits Insurance case. Although true to the book, the Miss Birdie and forbidden love subplots bog down the film with slow, uneventful scenes that do little to challenge Rudy's beliefs and substantially strengthen him as a character. If you've read the book, then you may enjoy this adaption for what it's worth--namely, DeVito's acting and a few lawyer jokes to pocket for later. http://bitesizemoviereview.blogspot.com/

    Having recently graduated from law school at the University of Memphis and unable to find lucrative employment, an earnest, idealistic young lawyer (Damon) begins working for a ruthless ambulance chaser (Rourke), then finds himself going head-to-head with an unscrupulous insurance company and its smarmy, overpaid legal defense team (led by Voight) after they failed to pay a claim for a young man diagnosed with leukemia. At the same time, the lawyer finds some degree of solace by becoming the unofficial "protector" of a battered woman (Danes). Superbly cast, with pitch-perfect performances, sure-handed direction, and good, intelligent storytelling. A bit on the long side, but still a well-made and respectable adaptation of John Grisham's novel. ***

    Francis Ford Coppola is both scriptwriter and director of this film entitled,The Rainmaker. It was adapted from the John Grisham novel about broke, inexperienced Memphis law-school graduate Rudy Baylor.It stars Matt Damon as Rudy Baylor together with an ensemble cast namely: Danny DeVito, Danny Glover, Claire Danes, Jon Voight, Roy Scheider, Mickey Rourke, Virginia Madsen,Mary Kay Place and Teresa Wright in her final film. Rudy Baylor, ready to take any job he can find. Signing on with slimy Bruiser Stone, he learns ambulance-chasing tactics from Bruiser's leg man Deck Schifflet and meets battered teen Kelly Riker (Claire Danes), abused by her husband. Baylor has his own clients -- friendly Miss Birdie, who has a large estate to dispose of, and desperate Dot Black, whose son Donnie Ray has terminal leukemia. Medical intervention could have spared his life, but the Great Benefit Insurance Company denied coverage, preventing Donnie Ray from getting a life-saving bone marrow transplant. Rudy finds a place to live in the apartment behind Miss Birdie's house. Deck and Rudy split from Bruiser to start their small firm. When they take on the Blacks' case, they go up against the insurance company's high-priced law firm and are continually thwarted by slick lawyer Leo F. Drummond. Coppola has infused The Rainmaker with enough humor, character, honest emotion and storytelling style to make it a very entertaining movie.Aside from that,the story is characterized with intelligence and subtlety that makes it interesting from beginning to end.Aside from that,the cast performed very well.Special mention should be given to Jon Voight and Danny DeVito. While Matt Damon did certainly provide great acting as the young Rudy Baylor. This legal drama is definitely one of the best that Grisham has ever written and Coppola has ever filmed.

    I firmly believe in this statement since: how come an truly and realistic great film with an excellent cast, directed by one of the most respected film directors of all time, is barely mentioned by people, almost unknown to many film viewers and also (as for my country) never shown on TV? It was released in theaters here but for a short time. I've never heard of this film being on regular TV and not even in cable TV, and the closer I get of this film was seeing the DVD somewhere, and unfortunately I haven't bought it. And to found it on the internet was even the hardest task ever but it's certainly rewarding. I'm not much into conspiracy theories but I really think someone's hiding this film from viewers. Who could it be? Maybe Paramount itself, company that distributes this film isn't much interested in making it more available for exhibitions or selling. But the danger of "The Rainmaker" lies in a story about bringing risky and millionaire lawsuits against health insurance companies, and (here comes the conspiracy theory which I was referring), but maybe the real companies are paying Paramount to hide this film in the best possible way. The film remains criminally underrated despite having some favorable things about it. In "The Rainmaker", Matt Damon plays Rudy Baylor, an promising and idealistic young lawyer, graduated from Harvard, trying his way into the law business working in a revolting case against Great Benefit, an health insurance company that denied an bone marrow transplant of Donny Ray, a young man dying of leukemia, something that was covered in their policy. Baylor's test is not only in this trial, fighting against Leo F. Drummond (an impeccable and inspiring Jon Voight) and his team of lawyers defending Great Benefit but also in dealing with his boss (Mickey Rourke), involved in some illicit business; with his partner Deck (Danny DeVito) who'll be of great help in bringing testimonies for his case and showing how justice and law really works outside of what law schools teach; and a semi-romantic affair he has with Kelly (Claire Danes), victim of an abusive husband he mets. And believe me, the film never slows down its rhythm at any of these segments, they're all interesting.

The players include John Voight as the sleazy corporate lawyer, Dean Stockwell as the corrupt judge in the pocket of the corporate world, Danny DeVito as Matt Damon's legal assistant/would be lawyer that can't seem to pass the bar exam, and Danny Glover as the anti-corporate judge whose rulings help Matt Damon bring the case to trial. The movie does a good job of presenting the ebb and flow of the case, he audience's opinion of guilt or innocence sways with each new witness and legal maneuver, until the final bombshell is dropped and the case is easily decided. To sum it up, the story is a bit clich&eacute; yet well told, the characters are similarly clich&eacute; yet well acted, and the ending is typical of Hollywood yet rewarding. In all The Rainmaker is a textbook example of a formula movie where attention to detail, characters, and plot make it better than it really is.

    My problems with it include the overall sappy tone, which marred Matt Damon's otherwise good performance as a rookie lawyer with a Southern twang. It was amusing to see him struggle, and Danny DeVito's character seemed to drive the picture. The plot was on the weak side of things, and it was tame for a John Grisham story. I was also expecting more out of Coppola post-Godfather. I'm glad that the good guys win and everybody feels better once the evil insurance company goes bankrupt. It was heartwarming, but I was expecting more intrigue and suspense. When it didn't come, it made Rudy's narration unnecessary and irritating. Danny Glover felt miscast as the judge, and Jon Voight wasn't allowed much time to shine. I was expecting an intense scene between him and Damon once the lawsuit intensified. The romance felt superfluous because the scenes with the Black family and the old lady show that Rudy cares about people. It was time better suited for conspiracy and chaos, especially since it all seems pointless as the wife gets spared by the DA. Rudy's buddies kept telling him to be careful, but I was left asking why because the bad guys only seemed to care about winning the case as opposed to escalating things with violence like any other Grisham story I've seen. I initially thought Bruiser (Mickey Rourke) would be the antagonist with something to hide, and frankly he was more intimidating and interesting than Great Benefit Insurance. However, it was still enjoyable. I would give it a 7 out of 10.

    This one gets three stars because the formula works to some extent every time. But clearly there is a story to tell behind this movie. FFC took this one on as a hired gun. His script is limp - one of the worst closing arguments in the history of courtroom drama. The script is credited to FFC with "narration" by a third party. The over-dubbing of dialog and the addition of a pointless narration, the half-told subplots and the rearrangement of events in the book all point to a desperate resuscitation attempt in post. I am amazed they kept Elmer Bernstein's music, which makes you feel like you are watching an episode of Mannix. And why is Danny Glover uncredited, when he has a major role? I love Coppola's movies, but his heart clearly was not in this one.

    Unless you have read John Grisham's novel, you probably will not enjoy the film adaption of The Rainmaker, which is as slow and boring as courtroom dramas come. Perhaps the only redeeming aspect is the talents of Danny DeVito, cast as Rudy's ever-scheming partner, Deck. The most frustrating aspect of the film is that the characters are all cast properly, but the actors did not reach their full potential due to sloppy editing and an incredibly slow-paced plot. Granted, this is a courtroom drama, not an action movie, but the plot is so fragmented that it's hard to stay focused on the Great Benefits Insurance case. Although true to the book, the Miss Birdie and forbidden love subplots bog down the film with slow, uneventful scenes that do little to challenge Rudy's beliefs and substantially strengthen him as a character. If you've read the book, then you may enjoy this adaption for what it's worth--namely, DeVito's acting and a few lawyer jokes to pocket for later. http://bitesizemoviereview.blogspot.com/

    Having recently graduated from law school at the University of Memphis and unable to find lucrative employment, an earnest, idealistic young lawyer (Damon) begins working for a ruthless ambulance chaser (Rourke), then finds himself going head-to-head with an unscrupulous insurance company and its smarmy, overpaid legal defense team (led by Voight) after they failed to pay a claim for a young man diagnosed with leukemia. At the same time, the lawyer finds some degree of solace by becoming the unofficial "protector" of a battered woman (Danes). Superbly cast, with pitch-perfect performances, sure-handed direction, and good, intelligent storytelling. A bit on the long side, but still a well-made and respectable adaptation of John Grisham's novel. ***

    Francis Ford Coppola is both scriptwriter and director of this film entitled,The Rainmaker. It was adapted from the John Grisham novel about broke, inexperienced Memphis law-school graduate Rudy Baylor.It stars Matt Damon as Rudy Baylor together with an ensemble cast namely: Danny DeVito, Danny Glover, Claire Danes, Jon Voight, Roy Scheider, Mickey Rourke, Virginia Madsen,Mary Kay Place and Teresa Wright in her final film. Rudy Baylor, ready to take any job he can find. Signing on with slimy Bruiser Stone, he learns ambulance-chasing tactics from Bruiser's leg man Deck Schifflet and meets battered teen Kelly Riker (Claire Danes), abused by her husband. Baylor has his own clients -- friendly Miss Birdie, who has a large estate to dispose of, and desperate Dot Black, whose son Donnie Ray has terminal leukemia. Medical intervention could have spared his life, but the Great Benefit Insurance Company denied coverage, preventing Donnie Ray from getting a life-saving bone marrow transplant. Rudy finds a place to live in the apartment behind Miss Birdie's house. Deck and Rudy split from Bruiser to start their small firm. When they take on the Blacks' case, they go up against the insurance company's high-priced law firm and are continually thwarted by slick lawyer Leo F. Drummond. Coppola has infused The Rainmaker with enough humor, character, honest emotion and storytelling style to make it a very entertaining movie.Aside from that,the story is characterized with intelligence and subtlety that makes it interesting from beginning to end.Aside from that,the cast performed very well.Special mention should be given to Jon Voight and Danny DeVito. While Matt Damon did certainly provide great acting as the young Rudy Baylor. This legal drama is definitely one of the best that Grisham has ever written and Coppola has ever filmed.

    I firmly believe in this statement since: how come an truly and realistic great film with an excellent cast, directed by one of the most respected film directors of all time, is barely mentioned by people, almost unknown to many film viewers and also (as for my country) never shown on TV? It was released in theaters here but for a short time. I've never heard of this film being on regular TV and not even in cable TV, and the closer I get of this film was seeing the DVD somewhere, and unfortunately I haven't bought it. And to found it on the internet was even the hardest task ever but it's certainly rewarding. I'm not much into conspiracy theories but I really think someone's hiding this film from viewers. Who could it be? Maybe Paramount itself, company that distributes this film isn't much interested in making it more available for exhibitions or selling. But the danger of "The Rainmaker" lies in a story about bringing risky and millionaire lawsuits against health insurance companies, and (here comes the conspiracy theory which I was referring), but maybe the real companies are paying Paramount to hide this film in the best possible way. The film remains criminally underrated despite having some favorable things about it. In "The Rainmaker", Matt Damon plays Rudy Baylor, an promising and idealistic young lawyer, graduated from Harvard, trying his way into the law business working in a revolting case against Great Benefit, an health insurance company that denied an bone marrow transplant of Donny Ray, a young man dying of leukemia, something that was covered in their policy. Baylor's test is not only in this trial, fighting against Leo F. Drummond (an impeccable and inspiring Jon Voight) and his team of lawyers defending Great Benefit but also in dealing with his boss (Mickey Rourke), involved in some illicit business; with his partner Deck (Danny DeVito) who'll be of great help in bringing testimonies for his case and showing how justice and law really works outside of what law schools teach; and a semi-romantic affair he has with Kelly (Claire Danes), victim of an abusive husband he mets. And believe me, the film never slows down its rhythm at any of these segments, they're all interesting. It's a story about a man fighting for what he believes in a troubled, dangerous, greedy and unethical world but he also needs to make some tricks in order to survive in this same world. His first client before Donny Ray's family is a guy involved in car accidents and who don't have a lawyer to represent them in legal assistance (but it's not something Rudy gets proud of). Rudy is also counts with luck to get things done, I mean, who could have thought that the original Judge selected for this case (and not much friendly with Rudy and his case) would collapse and die, being substituted by a more correct and friendly Judge (Danny Glover)? Like I said, all the segments were interestingly well made but the one that really captures all of our attention (and this is a must when it comes in films like these) is the whole trial. Here's an exciting, electrifying trial and obviously there's surprises (the appearance of a key witness, played by Virginia Madsen), twists and turns, some funny moments and the most interesting aspect of all, it shows how the legal system works, it digs deep into tiny little things that can make a huge difference between winning and losing a court battle. Despite this being directed by Francis Ford Coppola, in one of his attempts to pay for all the costs of the troubled and overbugeted "One From the Heart", which might sound like an film made for giving return in box-office less than being an intelligent and artistic film, "The Rainmaker" contains countless characteristics of his skillful direction, it's filmed and edited in a great style (one of those things that when you look back and watch the films made in the 1990's and then look at the ones made now, you feel the nostalgic feeling that, somehow, the films back then were better and this is a great example of that), followed by a nice soundtrack, and of course, the gigantic group of talented actors present here which also includes small appearances of Roy Scheider, Theresa Wright and Dean Stockwell, all in very good roles. Based on a John Grisham novel (he considers this his favorite film of all film adaptations of his work), this courtroom thriller is brilliantly memorable and it has one of the most original and realistic endings ever presented in films like these, it might look like an obvious clich&eacute; but then you have to wait to see more of what's about to come. Find this movie if you can and watch it right away. 10/10

    Very surprised this move ranked so low. It has a stellar cast, an interesting plot and some witty dialogue. Perhaps the subject matter is too "left of centre" for some, skewing votes lower? Matt Damon plays the young, inexperienced lawyer with a conscience very well. John Voight is equally adept as the big time corporate lawyer who's sold his soul to protect the interests of a multi-million dollar insurance company. The company is sued by a small, poor family whose son is dying of leukaemia and is denied insurance by the big bad company despite having a policy. Intertwined with that plot line is one where Damon becomes too involved with a battered wife and ends up rescuing her from her abusive husband. Movie is very well acted. The storyline flows but not too fast. It takes on the character of a slow southern drawl which is perfect since that is where it is set. 8/10.

    Rudy Baylor is a greenhorn lawyer in Memphis who lands a sensational case - a young man dying of leukaemia whose insurance company refuses to pay out. Can inexperienced Rudy take on the fat cat corporate sharks and dish out some justice ? This is a polished, well made, well acted courtroom drama from a bestselling novel by John Grisham, whose legal thrillers were very popular in the nineties (The Firm, The Pelican Brief, The Client). I'm afraid however I don't think much of the plot - greedy insurance company versus terminally ill kid coughing up blood is a bit too hackneyed for me, and when it throws in fisticuffs with the jury, company documents with mysterious missing bits, and last minute witnesses having affairs with the defendants, my Credibility Proximity Warning lights start to flash. It also has a lengthy subplot involving a battered wife which is touching but has precisely zero relevance. In my view, stories should be tight, focused and original, and I'm not convinced Grisham's are. That said the characters are rich and the drama has some good points to make about the legal exploitation of the US working class, as well as many funny scenes, like the one where DeVito walks down to the hospital and presses his card into the hands of patients in traction. Its strongest suit is the cast - Damon is suitably bewildered and well-intentioned, DeVito holds everything together as the shyster evidence man, Voight is toothy and evil as the corporate pit bull, an unbilled Glover is the judge, Madsen (Dune, Candyman) has an eye-catching part as a bitter and sullied ex-executive, the late great Scheider shows up at the end as the CEO, and Coppola alumni Rourke and Stockwell shine in off-the-wall parts as a mumbling one-step-away-from-prison legal embezzler and a bad-tempered emphysemic judge with a very short life expectancy respectively. The batty old bird is played by Teresa Wright, the young star of several forties classics (such as Hitchcock's Shadow Of A Doubt), aged seventy-seven and making her final film, and West in the small part of the Dad shows how it's possible to create a thought-provoking and fully-fledged character with literally no dialogue. They're all fun to watch strutting their stuff and riffing off each other. In the end though, this is a disappointing movie for me, purely because its scope falls well short of its director's talent. It's a good movie, but it's a safe movie - it looks familiar, it makes you smile and gasp at all the right points, and the heroes win. What makes Coppola's movies great is when he doesn't make them safe. Most people would say this is a better film than One From The Heart, but not me - while that movie may have its flaws too, it's completely original and unlike anything else; it's an artist putting himself on the line (and in that instance getting savaged for it) but injecting his soul into his art. The Rainmaker is a solid bet, an agreeable thriller, but unlike its director it's nothing special.

    It starts out well enough, with a finely orchestrated first hour during which we are introduced to some genuinely compelling characters, including an impressively subdued but very potent Mickey Rourke as Bruiser Stone, the flashy first boss of newly minted kid lawyer Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon), and an extremely vibrant Danny DeVito as a less than virtuous but endearing lawyer wanna-be, Deck Shifflet. There are tender and poignant performances by supporting players, such as Johnny Whitworth as the leukemia stricken Donny Ray Black. The role of Donny's mother is finely handled by Mary Kay Place, her naturally blithe spirit suppressed in a character of considerable depth and subtle inflection. Claire Danes as Kelly Riker, a stoic victim of domestic abuse, proves herself equal to any other working actress. Rudy's non-relationship with Kelly only magnifies the immensity of the good boy's complete total awesomeness. Eventually the increasingly manipulative story wears itself out, the mounting heap of standard court room drama clich&eacute;s just too expansive an obstacle for me to navigate. This film had pretty much drained all my accounts by the 90 minute mark, but there were still another 45 minutes of bilking, such as the appearance of a key witness whose insider information threatens to incriminate the evil large corporation. Virgina Madsen is convincing in the part, but her fine contribution is undermined by the film's insistently maudlin tactics. No sooner had she delivered her moving testimony - count to four - and the poor girl is exposed as the scornful rejected lover of the nasty company man. Her character is further impugned by her own admission that she traded sex for corporate privilege, but only because it was demanded of her. Even a perfectly green, wet behind the ears, newbie lawyer would have sense enough to thoroughly check out a star witness' background, and if not Rudy, than certainly the crafty Deck Shifflet. But Rudy's improbable incompetence was already established in his first appearance before a judge where he didn't have the single slightest clue of courtroom procedure, despite 3 or 4 years of law school experience. Oh right, it was a modest, second rate, non Ivy League school. Maybe the school advertised on the back of match books? If Danny Glover as the mercifully decent replacement judge can't win me back into the film's corner, then maybe a comically sweatered Roy Sheider can. He's a dependable source of fine drama, but his minor bit is too little too late to save this con job that doesn't even have sense enough to end when its over. It just keeps plodding on and on, tripping over at least two or three endings before it finally trickles out, collapsed under its own ponderous weight. I don't know who to despise more - me for having allowed myself to be roped into this tedious swindle, or the shameless driver of this fraudulent car wreck. Remind me again just who is its two-faced, fork-tongued shyster director?!

    Lawyer movies are only worth watching if they are well done, and The Rainmaker is one of those movies. Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon) is a young lawyer straight out of law school and desperate for work. While learning the legal ropes under a crooked lawyer, Bruiser Stone (Mickey Rourke), Rudy takes on the case of Donny Ray Black (Johnny Whitworth) a young boy stricken with leukemia and his medical claims denied by his insurance company. What follows is a typical case of the little guy vs. big corporate greed, but what makes the story watchable and not clich&eacute; is the wonderful cast and acting. The players include John Voight as the sleazy corporate lawyer, Dean Stockwell as the corrupt judge in the pocket of the corporate world, Danny DeVito as Matt Damon's legal assistant/would be lawyer that can't seem to pass the bar exam, and Danny Glover as the anti-corporate judge whose rulings help Matt Damon bring the case to trial.

Like I said, all the segments were interestingly well made but the one that really captures all of our attention (and this is a must when it comes in films like these) is the whole trial. Here's an exciting, electrifying trial and obviously there's surprises (the appearance of a key witness, played by Virginia Madsen), twists and turns, some funny moments and the most interesting aspect of all, it shows how the legal system works, it digs deep into tiny little things that can make a huge difference between winning and losing a court battle. Despite this being directed by Francis Ford Coppola, in one of his attempts to pay for all the costs of the troubled and overbugeted "One From the Heart", which might sound like an film made for giving return in box-office less than being an intelligent and artistic film, "The Rainmaker" contains countless characteristics of his skillful direction, it's filmed and edited in a great style (one of those things that when you look back and watch the films made in the 1990's and then look at the ones made now, you feel the nostalgic feeling that, somehow, the films back then were better and this is a great example of that), followed by a nice soundtrack, and of course, the gigantic group of talented actors present here which also includes small appearances of Roy Scheider, Theresa Wright and Dean Stockwell, all in very good roles. Based on a John Grisham novel (he considers this his favorite film of all film adaptations of his work), this courtroom thriller is brilliantly memorable and it has one of the most original and realistic endings ever presented in films like these, it might look like an obvious clich&eacute; but then you have to wait to see more of what's about to come. Find this movie if you can and watch it right away. 10/10

    Very surprised this move ranked so low. It has a stellar cast, an interesting plot and some witty dialogue. Perhaps the subject matter is too "left of centre" for some, skewing votes lower? Matt Damon plays the young, inexperienced lawyer with a conscience very well. John Voight is equally adept as the big time corporate lawyer who's sold his soul to protect the interests of a multi-million dollar insurance company. The company is sued by a small, poor family whose son is dying of leukaemia and is denied insurance by the big bad company despite having a policy. Intertwined with that plot line is one where Damon becomes too involved with a battered wife and ends up rescuing her from her abusive husband. Movie is very well acted. The storyline flows but not too fast. It takes on the character of a slow southern drawl which is perfect since that is where it is set. 8/10.

    Rudy Baylor is a greenhorn lawyer in Memphis who lands a sensational case - a young man dying of leukaemia whose insurance company refuses to pay out. Can inexperienced Rudy take on the fat cat corporate sharks and dish out some justice ? This is a polished, well made, well acted courtroom drama from a bestselling novel by John Grisham, whose legal thrillers were very popular in the nineties (The Firm, The Pelican Brief, The Client). I'm afraid however I don't think much of the plot - greedy insurance company versus terminally ill kid coughing up blood is a bit too hackneyed for me, and when it throws in fisticuffs with the jury, company documents with mysterious missing bits, and last minute witnesses having affairs with the defendants, my Credibility Proximity Warning lights start to flash. It also has a lengthy subplot involving a battered wife which is touching but has precisely zero relevance. In my view, stories should be tight, focused and original, and I'm not convinced Grisham's are. That said the characters are rich and the drama has some good points to make about the legal exploitation of the US working class, as well as many funny scenes, like the one where DeVito walks down to the hospital and presses his card into the hands of patients in traction. Its strongest suit is the cast - Damon is suitably bewildered and well-intentioned, DeVito holds everything together as the shyster evidence man, Voight is toothy and evil as the corporate pit bull, an unbilled Glover is the judge, Madsen (Dune, Candyman) has an eye-catching part as a bitter and sullied ex-executive, the late great Scheider shows up at the end as the CEO, and Coppola alumni Rourke and Stockwell shine in off-the-wall parts as a mumbling one-step-away-from-prison legal embezzler and a bad-tempered emphysemic judge with a very short life expectancy respectively. The batty old bird is played by Teresa Wright, the young star of several forties classics (such as Hitchcock's Shadow Of A Doubt), aged seventy-seven and making her final film, and West in the small part of the Dad shows how it's possible to create a thought-provoking and fully-fledged character with literally no dialogue. They're all fun to watch strutting their stuff and riffing off each other. In the end though, this is a disappointing movie for me, purely because its scope falls well short of its director's talent. It's a good movie, but it's a safe movie - it looks familiar, it makes you smile and gasp at all the right points, and the heroes win. What makes Coppola's movies great is when he doesn't make them safe. Most people would say this is a better film than One From The Heart, but not me - while that movie may have its flaws too, it's completely original and unlike anything else; it's an artist putting himself on the line (and in that instance getting savaged for it) but injecting his soul into his art. The Rainmaker is a solid bet, an agreeable thriller, but unlike its director it's nothing special.

    It starts out well enough, with a finely orchestrated first hour during which we are introduced to some genuinely compelling characters, including an impressively subdued but very potent Mickey Rourke as Bruiser Stone, the flashy first boss of newly minted kid lawyer Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon), and an extremely vibrant Danny DeVito as a less than virtuous but endearing lawyer wanna-be, Deck Shifflet. There are tender and poignant performances by supporting players, such as Johnny Whitworth as the leukemia stricken Donny Ray Black. The role of Donny's mother is finely handled by Mary Kay Place, her naturally blithe spirit suppressed in a character of considerable depth and subtle inflection. Claire Danes as Kelly Riker, a stoic victim of domestic abuse, proves herself equal to any other working actress. Rudy's non-relationship with Kelly only magnifies the immensity of the good boy's complete total awesomeness. Eventually the increasingly manipulative story wears itself out, the mounting heap of standard court room drama clich&eacute;s just too expansive an obstacle for me to navigate. This film had pretty much drained all my accounts by the 90 minute mark, but there were still another 45 minutes of bilking, such as the appearance of a key witness whose insider information threatens to incriminate the evil large corporation. Virgina Madsen is convincing in the part, but her fine contribution is undermined by the film's insistently maudlin tactics. No sooner had she delivered her moving testimony - count to four - and the poor girl is exposed as the scornful rejected lover of the nasty company man. Her character is further impugned by her own admission that she traded sex for corporate privilege, but only because it was demanded of her. Even a perfectly green, wet behind the ears, newbie lawyer would have sense enough to thoroughly check out a star witness' background, and if not Rudy, than certainly the crafty Deck Shifflet. But Rudy's improbable incompetence was already established in his first appearance before a judge where he didn't have the single slightest clue of courtroom procedure, despite 3 or 4 years of law school experience. Oh right, it was a modest, second rate, non Ivy League school. Maybe the school advertised on the back of match books? If Danny Glover as the mercifully decent replacement judge can't win me back into the film's corner, then maybe a comically sweatered Roy Sheider can. He's a dependable source of fine drama, but his minor bit is too little too late to save this con job that doesn't even have sense enough to end when its over. It just keeps plodding on and on, tripping over at least two or three endings before it finally trickles out, collapsed under its own ponderous weight. I don't know who to despise more - me for having allowed myself to be roped into this tedious swindle, or the shameless driver of this fraudulent car wreck. Remind me again just who is its two-faced, fork-tongued shyster director?!

    Lawyer movies are only worth watching if they are well done, and The Rainmaker is one of those movies. Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon) is a young lawyer straight out of law school and desperate for work. While learning the legal ropes under a crooked lawyer, Bruiser Stone (Mickey Rourke), Rudy takes on the case of Donny Ray Black (Johnny Whitworth) a young boy stricken with leukemia and his medical claims denied by his insurance company. What follows is a typical case of the little guy vs. big corporate greed, but what makes the story watchable and not clich&eacute; is the wonderful cast and acting. The players include John Voight as the sleazy corporate lawyer, Dean Stockwell as the corrupt judge in the pocket of the corporate world, Danny DeVito as Matt Damon's legal assistant/would be lawyer that can't seem to pass the bar exam, and Danny Glover as the anti-corporate judge whose rulings help Matt Damon bring the case to trial. The movie does a good job of presenting the ebb and flow of the case, he audience's opinion of guilt or innocence sways with each new witness and legal maneuver, until the final bombshell is dropped and the case is easily decided. To sum it up, the story is a bit clich&eacute; yet well told, the characters are similarly clich&eacute; yet well acted, and the ending is typical of Hollywood yet rewarding. In all The Rainmaker is a textbook example of a formula movie where attention to detail, characters, and plot make it better than it really is.

    My problems with it include the overall sappy tone, which marred Matt Damon's otherwise good performance as a rookie lawyer with a Southern twang. It was amusing to see him struggle, and Danny DeVito's character seemed to drive the picture. The plot was on the weak side of things, and it was tame for a John Grisham story. I was also expecting more out of Coppola post-Godfather. I'm glad that the good guys win and everybody feels better once the evil insurance company goes bankrupt. It was heartwarming, but I was expecting more intrigue and suspense. When it didn't come, it made Rudy's narration unnecessary and irritating. Danny Glover felt miscast as the judge, and Jon Voight wasn't allowed much time to shine. I was expecting an intense scene between him and Damon once the lawsuit intensified. The romance felt superfluous because the scenes with the Black family and the old lady show that Rudy cares about people. It was time better suited for conspiracy and chaos, especially since it all seems pointless as the wife gets spared by the DA. Rudy's buddies kept telling him to be careful, but I was left asking why because the bad guys only seemed to care about winning the case as opposed to escalating things with violence like any other Grisham story I've seen. I initially thought Bruiser (Mickey Rourke) would be the antagonist with something to hide, and frankly he was more intimidating and interesting than Great Benefit Insurance. However, it was still enjoyable. I would give it a 7 out of 10.

    This one gets three stars because the formula works to some extent every time. But clearly there is a story to tell behind this movie. FFC took this one on as a hired gun. His script is limp - one of the worst closing arguments in the history of courtroom drama. The script is credited to FFC with "narration" by a third party. The over-dubbing of dialog and the addition of a pointless narration, the half-told subplots and the rearrangement of events in the book all point to a desperate resuscitation attempt in post. I am amazed they kept Elmer Bernstein's music, which makes you feel like you are watching an episode of Mannix. And why is Danny Glover uncredited, when he has a major role? I love Coppola's movies, but his heart clearly was not in this one.

    Unless you have read John Grisham's novel, you probably will not enjoy the film adaption of The Rainmaker, which is as slow and boring as courtroom dramas come. Perhaps the only redeeming aspect is the talents of Danny DeVito, cast as Rudy's ever-scheming partner, Deck. The most frustrating aspect of the film is that the characters are all cast properly, but the actors did not reach their full potential due to sloppy editing and an incredibly slow-paced plot. Granted, this is a courtroom drama, not an action movie, but the plot is so fragmented that it's hard to stay focused on the Great Benefits Insurance case. Although true to the book, the Miss Birdie and forbidden love subplots bog down the film with slow, uneventful scenes that do little to challenge Rudy's beliefs and substantially strengthen him as a character. If you've read the book, then you may enjoy this adaption for what it's worth--namely, DeVito's acting and a few lawyer jokes to pocket for later. http://bitesizemoviereview.blogspot.com/

    Having recently graduated from law school at the University of Memphis and unable to find lucrative employment, an earnest, idealistic young lawyer (Damon) begins working for a ruthless ambulance chaser (Rourke), then finds himself going head-to-head with an unscrupulous insurance company and its smarmy, overpaid legal defense team (led by Voight) after they failed to pay a claim for a young man diagnosed with leukemia. At the same time, the lawyer finds some degree of solace by becoming the unofficial "protector" of a battered woman (Danes). Superbly cast, with pitch-perfect performances, sure-handed direction, and good, intelligent storytelling. A bit on the long side, but still a well-made and respectable adaptation of John Grisham's novel. ***

    Francis Ford Coppola is both scriptwriter and director of this film entitled,The Rainmaker. It was adapted from the John Grisham novel about broke, inexperienced Memphis law-school graduate Rudy Baylor.It stars Matt Damon as Rudy Baylor together with an ensemble cast namely: Danny DeVito, Danny Glover, Claire Danes, Jon Voight, Roy Scheider, Mickey Rourke, Virginia Madsen,Mary Kay Place and Teresa Wright in her final film. Rudy Baylor, ready to take any job he can find. Signing on with slimy Bruiser Stone, he learns ambulance-chasing tactics from Bruiser's leg man Deck Schifflet and meets battered teen Kelly Riker (Claire Danes), abused by her husband. Baylor has his own clients -- friendly Miss Birdie, who has a large estate to dispose of, and desperate Dot Black, whose son Donnie Ray has terminal leukemia. Medical intervention could have spared his life, but the Great Benefit Insurance Company denied coverage, preventing Donnie Ray from getting a life-saving bone marrow transplant. Rudy finds a place to live in the apartment behind Miss Birdie's house. Deck and Rudy split from Bruiser to start their small firm. When they take on the Blacks' case, they go up against the insurance company's high-priced law firm and are continually thwarted by slick lawyer Leo F. Drummond. Coppola has infused The Rainmaker with enough humor, character, honest emotion and storytelling style to make it a very entertaining movie.Aside from that,the story is characterized with intelligence and subtlety that makes it interesting from beginning to end.Aside from that,the cast performed very well.Special mention should be given to Jon Voight and Danny DeVito. While Matt Damon did certainly provide great acting as the young Rudy Baylor. This legal drama is definitely one of the best that Grisham has ever written and Coppola has ever filmed.

    I firmly believe in this statement since: how come an truly and realistic great film with an excellent cast, directed by one of the most respected film directors of all time, is barely mentioned by people, almost unknown to many film viewers and also (as for my country) never shown on TV? It was released in theaters here but for a short time. I've never heard of this film being on regular TV and not even in cable TV, and the closer I get of this film was seeing the DVD somewhere, and unfortunately I haven't bought it. And to found it on the internet was even the hardest task ever but it's certainly rewarding. I'm not much into conspiracy theories but I really think someone's hiding this film from viewers. Who could it be? Maybe Paramount itself, company that distributes this film isn't much interested in making it more available for exhibitions or selling. But the danger of "The Rainmaker" lies in a story about bringing risky and millionaire lawsuits against health insurance companies, and (here comes the conspiracy theory which I was referring), but maybe the real companies are paying Paramount to hide this film in the best possible way. The film remains criminally underrated despite having some favorable things about it. In "The Rainmaker", Matt Damon plays Rudy Baylor, an promising and idealistic young lawyer, graduated from Harvard, trying his way into the law business working in a revolting case against Great Benefit, an health insurance company that denied an bone marrow transplant of Donny Ray, a young man dying of leukemia, something that was covered in their policy. Baylor's test is not only in this trial, fighting against Leo F. Drummond (an impeccable and inspiring Jon Voight) and his team of lawyers defending Great Benefit but also in dealing with his boss (Mickey Rourke), involved in some illicit business; with his partner Deck (Danny DeVito) who'll be of great help in bringing testimonies for his case and showing how justice and law really works outside of what law schools teach; and a semi-romantic affair he has with Kelly (Claire Danes), victim of an abusive husband he mets. And believe me, the film never slows down its rhythm at any of these segments, they're all interesting. It's a story about a man fighting for what he believes in a troubled, dangerous, greedy and unethical world but he also needs to make some tricks in order to survive in this same world. His first client before Donny Ray's family is a guy involved in car accidents and who don't have a lawyer to represent them in legal assistance (but it's not something Rudy gets proud of). Rudy is also counts with luck to get things done, I mean, who could have thought that the original Judge selected for this case (and not much friendly with Rudy and his case) would collapse and die, being substituted by a more correct and friendly Judge (Danny Glover)? Like I said, all the segments were interestingly well made but the one that really captures all of our attention (and this is a must when it comes in films like these) is the whole trial. Here's an exciting, electrifying trial and obviously there's surprises (the appearance of a key witness, played by Virginia Madsen), twists and turns, some funny moments and the most interesting aspect of all, it shows how the legal system works, it digs deep into tiny little things that can make a huge difference between winning and losing a court battle.

    My problems with it include the overall sappy tone, which marred Matt Damon's otherwise good performance as a rookie lawyer with a Southern twang. It was amusing to see him struggle, and Danny DeVito's character seemed to drive the picture. The plot was on the weak side of things, and it was tame for a John Grisham story. I was also expecting more out of Coppola post-Godfather. I'm glad that the good guys win and everybody feels better once the evil insurance company goes bankrupt. It was heartwarming, but I was expecting more intrigue and suspense. When it didn't come, it made Rudy's narration unnecessary and irritating. Danny Glover felt miscast as the judge, and Jon Voight wasn't allowed much time to shine. I was expecting an intense scene between him and Damon once the lawsuit intensified. The romance felt superfluous because the scenes with the Black family and the old lady show that Rudy cares about people. It was time better suited for conspiracy and chaos, especially since it all seems pointless as the wife gets spared by the DA. Rudy's buddies kept telling him to be careful, but I was left asking why because the bad guys only seemed to care about winning the case as opposed to escalating things with violence like any other Grisham story I've seen. I initially thought Bruiser (Mickey Rourke) would be the antagonist with something to hide, and frankly he was more intimidating and interesting than Great Benefit Insurance. However, it was still enjoyable. I would give it a 7 out of 10.

    This one gets three stars because the formula works to some extent every time. But clearly there is a story to tell behind this movie. FFC took this one on as a hired gun. His script is limp - one of the worst closing arguments in the history of courtroom drama. The script is credited to FFC with "narration" by a third party. The over-dubbing of dialog and the addition of a pointless narration, the half-told subplots and the rearrangement of events in the book all point to a desperate resuscitation attempt in post. I am amazed they kept Elmer Bernstein's music, which makes you feel like you are watching an episode of Mannix. And why is Danny Glover uncredited, when he has a major role? I love Coppola's movies, but his heart clearly was not in this one.

    Unless you have read John Grisham's novel, you probably will not enjoy the film adaption of The Rainmaker, which is as slow and boring as courtroom dramas come. Perhaps the only redeeming aspect is the talents of Danny DeVito, cast as Rudy's ever-scheming partner, Deck. The most frustrating aspect of the film is that the characters are all cast properly, but the actors did not reach their full potential due to sloppy editing and an incredibly slow-paced plot. Granted, this is a courtroom drama, not an action movie, but the plot is so fragmented that it's hard to stay focused on the Great Benefits Insurance case. Although true to the book, the Miss Birdie and forbidden love subplots bog down the film with slow, uneventful scenes that do little to challenge Rudy's beliefs and substantially strengthen him as a character. If you've read the book, then you may enjoy this adaption for what it's worth--namely, DeVito's acting and a few lawyer jokes to pocket for later. http://bitesizemoviereview.blogspot.com/

    Having recently graduated from law school at the University of Memphis and unable to find lucrative employment, an earnest, idealistic young lawyer (Damon) begins working for a ruthless ambulance chaser (Rourke), then finds himself going head-to-head with an unscrupulous insurance company and its smarmy, overpaid legal defense team (led by Voight) after they failed to pay a claim for a young man diagnosed with leukemia. At the same time, the lawyer finds some degree of solace by becoming the unofficial "protector" of a battered woman (Danes). Superbly cast, with pitch-perfect performances, sure-handed direction, and good, intelligent storytelling. A bit on the long side, but still a well-made and respectable adaptation of John Grisham's novel. ***

    Francis Ford Coppola is both scriptwriter and director of this film entitled,The Rainmaker. It was adapted from the John Grisham novel about broke, inexperienced Memphis law-school graduate Rudy Baylor.It stars Matt Damon as Rudy Baylor together with an ensemble cast namely: Danny DeVito, Danny Glover, Claire Danes, Jon Voight, Roy Scheider, Mickey Rourke, Virginia Madsen,Mary Kay Place and Teresa Wright in her final film. Rudy Baylor, ready to take any job he can find. Signing on with slimy Bruiser Stone, he learns ambulance-chasing tactics from Bruiser's leg man Deck Schifflet and meets battered teen Kelly Riker (Claire Danes), abused by her husband. Baylor has his own clients -- friendly Miss Birdie, who has a large estate to dispose of, and desperate Dot Black, whose son Donnie Ray has terminal leukemia. Medical intervention could have spared his life, but the Great Benefit Insurance Company denied coverage, preventing Donnie Ray from getting a life-saving bone marrow transplant. Rudy finds a place to live in the apartment behind Miss Birdie's house. Deck and Rudy split from Bruiser to start their small firm. When they take on the Blacks' case, they go up against the insurance company's high-priced law firm and are continually thwarted by slick lawyer Leo F. Drummond. Coppola has infused The Rainmaker with enough humor, character, honest emotion and storytelling style to make it a very entertaining movie.Aside from that,the story is characterized with intelligence and subtlety that makes it interesting from beginning to end.Aside from that,the cast performed very well.Special mention should be given to Jon Voight and Danny DeVito. While Matt Damon did certainly provide great acting as the young Rudy Baylor. This legal drama is definitely one of the best that Grisham has ever written and Coppola has ever filmed.

    I firmly believe in this statement since: how come an truly and realistic great film with an excellent cast, directed by one of the most respected film directors of all time, is barely mentioned by people, almost unknown to many film viewers and also (as for my country) never shown on TV? It was released in theaters here but for a short time. I've never heard of this film being on regular TV and not even in cable TV, and the closer I get of this film was seeing the DVD somewhere, and unfortunately I haven't bought it. And to found it on the internet was even the hardest task ever but it's certainly rewarding. I'm not much into conspiracy theories but I really think someone's hiding this film from viewers. Who could it be? Maybe Paramount itself, company that distributes this film isn't much interested in making it more available for exhibitions or selling. But the danger of "The Rainmaker" lies in a story about bringing risky and millionaire lawsuits against health insurance companies, and (here comes the conspiracy theory which I was referring), but maybe the real companies are paying Paramount to hide this film in the best possible way. The film remains criminally underrated despite having some favorable things about it. In "The Rainmaker", Matt Damon plays Rudy Baylor, an promising and idealistic young lawyer, graduated from Harvard, trying his way into the law business working in a revolting case against Great Benefit, an health insurance company that denied an bone marrow transplant of Donny Ray, a young man dying of leukemia, something that was covered in their policy. Baylor's test is not only in this trial, fighting against Leo F. Drummond (an impeccable and inspiring Jon Voight) and his team of lawyers defending Great Benefit but also in dealing with his boss (Mickey Rourke), involved in some illicit business; with his partner Deck (Danny DeVito) who'll be of great help in bringing testimonies for his case and showing how justice and law really works outside of what law schools teach; and a semi-romantic affair he has with Kelly (Claire Danes), victim of an abusive husband he mets. And believe me, the film never slows down its rhythm at any of these segments, they're all interesting. It's a story about a man fighting for what he believes in a troubled, dangerous, greedy and unethical world but he also needs to make some tricks in order to survive in this same world. His first client before Donny Ray's family is a guy involved in car accidents and who don't have a lawyer to represent them in legal assistance (but it's not something Rudy gets proud of). Rudy is also counts with luck to get things done, I mean, who could have thought that the original Judge selected for this case (and not much friendly with Rudy and his case) would collapse and die, being substituted by a more correct and friendly Judge (Danny Glover)? Like I said, all the segments were interestingly well made but the one that really captures all of our attention (and this is a must when it comes in films like these) is the whole trial. Here's an exciting, electrifying trial and obviously there's surprises (the appearance of a key witness, played by Virginia Madsen), twists and turns, some funny moments and the most interesting aspect of all, it shows how the legal system works, it digs deep into tiny little things that can make a huge difference between winning and losing a court battle. Despite this being directed by Francis Ford Coppola, in one of his attempts to pay for all the costs of the troubled and overbugeted "One From the Heart", which might sound like an film made for giving return in box-office less than being an intelligent and artistic film, "The Rainmaker" contains countless characteristics of his skillful direction, it's filmed and edited in a great style (one of those things that when you look back and watch the films made in the 1990's and then look at the ones made now, you feel the nostalgic feeling that, somehow, the films back then were better and this is a great example of that), followed by a nice soundtrack, and of course, the gigantic group of talented actors present here which also includes small appearances of Roy Scheider, Theresa Wright and Dean Stockwell, all in very good roles. Based on a John Grisham novel (he considers this his favorite film of all film adaptations of his work), this courtroom thriller is brilliantly memorable and it has one of the most original and realistic endings ever presented in films like these, it might look like an obvious clich&eacute; but then you have to wait to see more of what's about to come. Find this movie if you can and watch it right away. 10/10

    Very surprised this move ranked so low. It has a stellar cast, an interesting plot and some witty dialogue. Perhaps the subject matter is too "left of centre" for some, skewing votes lower? Matt Damon plays the young, inexperienced lawyer with a conscience very well. John Voight is equally adept as the big time corporate lawyer who's sold his soul to protect the interests of a multi-million dollar insurance company. The company is sued by a small, poor family whose son is dying of leukaemia and is denied insurance by the big bad company despite having a policy. Intertwined with that plot line is one where Damon becomes too involved with a battered wife and ends up rescuing her from her abusive husband. Movie is very well acted. The storyline flows but not too fast. It takes on the character of a slow southern drawl which is perfect since that is where it is set. 8/10.

    Rudy Baylor is a greenhorn lawyer in Memphis who lands a sensational case - a young man dying of leukaemia whose insurance company refuses to pay out. Can inexperienced Rudy take on the fat cat corporate sharks and dish out some justice ? This is a polished, well made, well acted courtroom drama from a bestselling novel by John Grisham, whose legal thrillers were very popular in the nineties (The Firm, The Pelican Brief, The Client). I'm afraid however I don't think much of the plot - greedy insurance company versus terminally ill kid coughing up blood is a bit too hackneyed for me, and when it throws in fisticuffs with the jury, company documents with mysterious missing bits, and last minute witnesses having affairs with the defendants, my Credibility Proximity Warning lights start to flash. It also has a lengthy subplot involving a battered wife which is touching but has precisely zero relevance. In my view, stories should be tight, focused and original, and I'm not convinced Grisham's are. That said the characters are rich and the drama has some good points to make about the legal exploitation of the US working class, as well as many funny scenes, like the one where DeVito walks down to the hospital and presses his card into the hands of patients in traction. Its strongest suit is the cast - Damon is suitably bewildered and well-intentioned, DeVito holds everything together as the shyster evidence man, Voight is toothy and evil as the corporate pit bull, an unbilled Glover is the judge, Madsen (Dune, Candyman) has an eye-catching part as a bitter and sullied ex-executive, the late great Scheider shows up at the end as the CEO, and Coppola alumni Rourke and Stockwell shine in off-the-wall parts as a mumbling one-step-away-from-prison legal embezzler and a bad-tempered emphysemic judge with a very short life expectancy respectively. The batty old bird is played by Teresa Wright, the young star of several forties classics (such as Hitchcock's Shadow Of A Doubt), aged seventy-seven and making her final film, and West in the small part of the Dad shows how it's possible to create a thought-provoking and fully-fledged character with literally no dialogue. They're all fun to watch strutting their stuff and riffing off each other. In the end though, this is a disappointing movie for me, purely because its scope falls well short of its director's talent. It's a good movie, but it's a safe movie - it looks familiar, it makes you smile and gasp at all the right points, and the heroes win. What makes Coppola's movies great is when he doesn't make them safe. Most people would say this is a better film than One From The Heart, but not me - while that movie may have its flaws too, it's completely original and unlike anything else; it's an artist putting himself on the line (and in that instance getting savaged for it) but injecting his soul into his art. The Rainmaker is a solid bet, an agreeable thriller, but unlike its director it's nothing special.

    It starts out well enough, with a finely orchestrated first hour during which we are introduced to some genuinely compelling characters, including an impressively subdued but very potent Mickey Rourke as Bruiser Stone, the flashy first boss of newly minted kid lawyer Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon), and an extremely vibrant Danny DeVito as a less than virtuous but endearing lawyer wanna-be, Deck Shifflet. There are tender and poignant performances by supporting players, such as Johnny Whitworth as the leukemia stricken Donny Ray Black. The role of Donny's mother is finely handled by Mary Kay Place, her naturally blithe spirit suppressed in a character of considerable depth and subtle inflection. Claire Danes as Kelly Riker, a stoic victim of domestic abuse, proves herself equal to any other working actress. Rudy's non-relationship with Kelly only magnifies the immensity of the good boy's complete total awesomeness. Eventually the increasingly manipulative story wears itself out, the mounting heap of standard court room drama clich&eacute;s just too expansive an obstacle for me to navigate. This film had pretty much drained all my accounts by the 90 minute mark, but there were still another 45 minutes of bilking, such as the appearance of a key witness whose insider information threatens to incriminate the evil large corporation. Virgina Madsen is convincing in the part, but her fine contribution is undermined by the film's insistently maudlin tactics. No sooner had she delivered her moving testimony - count to four - and the poor girl is exposed as the scornful rejected lover of the nasty company man. Her character is further impugned by her own admission that she traded sex for corporate privilege, but only because it was demanded of her. Even a perfectly green, wet behind the ears, newbie lawyer would have sense enough to thoroughly check out a star witness' background, and if not Rudy, than certainly the crafty Deck Shifflet. But Rudy's improbable incompetence was already established in his first appearance before a judge where he didn't have the single slightest clue of courtroom procedure, despite 3 or 4 years of law school experience. Oh right, it was a modest, second rate, non Ivy League school. Maybe the school advertised on the back of match books? If Danny Glover as the mercifully decent replacement judge can't win me back into the film's corner, then maybe a comically sweatered Roy Sheider can. He's a dependable source of fine drama, but his minor bit is too little too late to save this con job that doesn't even have sense enough to end when its over. It just keeps plodding on and on, tripping over at least two or three endings before it finally trickles out, collapsed under its own ponderous weight. I don't know who to despise more - me for having allowed myself to be roped into this tedious swindle, or the shameless driver of this fraudulent car wreck. Remind me again just who is its two-faced, fork-tongued shyster director?!

    Lawyer movies are only worth watching if they are well done, and The Rainmaker is one of those movies. Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon) is a young lawyer straight out of law school and desperate for work. While learning the legal ropes under a crooked lawyer, Bruiser Stone (Mickey Rourke), Rudy takes on the case of Donny Ray Black (Johnny Whitworth) a young boy stricken with leukemia and his medical claims denied by his insurance company. What follows is a typical case of the little guy vs. big corporate greed, but what makes the story watchable and not clich&eacute; is the wonderful cast and acting. The players include John Voight as the sleazy corporate lawyer, Dean Stockwell as the corrupt judge in the pocket of the corporate world, Danny DeVito as Matt Damon's legal assistant/would be lawyer that can't seem to pass the bar exam, and Danny Glover as the anti-corporate judge whose rulings help Matt Damon bring the case to trial. The movie does a good job of presenting the ebb and flow of the case, he audience's opinion of guilt or innocence sways with each new witness and legal maneuver, until the final bombshell is dropped and the case is easily decided. To sum it up, the story is a bit clich&eacute; yet well told, the characters are similarly clich&eacute; yet well acted, and the ending is typical of Hollywood yet rewarding. In all The Rainmaker is a textbook example of a formula movie where attention to detail, characters, and plot make it better than it really is.

Based on a John Grisham novel (he considers this his favorite film of all film adaptations of his work), this courtroom thriller is brilliantly memorable and it has one of the most original and realistic endings ever presented in films like these, it might look like an obvious clich&eacute; but then you have to wait to see more of what's about to come. Find this movie if you can and watch it right away. 10/10

    Very surprised this move ranked so low. It has a stellar cast, an interesting plot and some witty dialogue. Perhaps the subject matter is too "left of centre" for some, skewing votes lower? Matt Damon plays the young, inexperienced lawyer with a conscience very well. John Voight is equally adept as the big time corporate lawyer who's sold his soul to protect the interests of a multi-million dollar insurance company. The company is sued by a small, poor family whose son is dying of leukaemia and is denied insurance by the big bad company despite having a policy. Intertwined with that plot line is one where Damon becomes too involved with a battered wife and ends up rescuing her from her abusive husband. Movie is very well acted. The storyline flows but not too fast. It takes on the character of a slow southern drawl which is perfect since that is where it is set. 8/10.

    Rudy Baylor is a greenhorn lawyer in Memphis who lands a sensational case - a young man dying of leukaemia whose insurance company refuses to pay out. Can inexperienced Rudy take on the fat cat corporate sharks and dish out some justice ? This is a polished, well made, well acted courtroom drama from a bestselling novel by John Grisham, whose legal thrillers were very popular in the nineties (The Firm, The Pelican Brief, The Client). I'm afraid however I don't think much of the plot - greedy insurance company versus terminally ill kid coughing up blood is a bit too hackneyed for me, and when it throws in fisticuffs with the jury, company documents with mysterious missing bits, and last minute witnesses having affairs with the defendants, my Credibility Proximity Warning lights start to flash. It also has a lengthy subplot involving a battered wife which is touching but has precisely zero relevance. In my view, stories should be tight, focused and original, and I'm not convinced Grisham's are. That said the characters are rich and the drama has some good points to make about the legal exploitation of the US working class, as well as many funny scenes, like the one where DeVito walks down to the hospital and presses his card into the hands of patients in traction. Its strongest suit is the cast - Damon is suitably bewildered and well-intentioned, DeVito holds everything together as the shyster evidence man, Voight is toothy and evil as the corporate pit bull, an unbilled Glover is the judge, Madsen (Dune, Candyman) has an eye-catching part as a bitter and sullied ex-executive, the late great Scheider shows up at the end as the CEO, and Coppola alumni Rourke and Stockwell shine in off-the-wall parts as a mumbling one-step-away-from-prison legal embezzler and a bad-tempered emphysemic judge with a very short life expectancy respectively. The batty old bird is played by Teresa Wright, the young star of several forties classics (such as Hitchcock's Shadow Of A Doubt), aged seventy-seven and making her final film, and West in the small part of the Dad shows how it's possible to create a thought-provoking and fully-fledged character with literally no dialogue. They're all fun to watch strutting their stuff and riffing off each other. In the end though, this is a disappointing movie for me, purely because its scope falls well short of its director's talent. It's a good movie, but it's a safe movie - it looks familiar, it makes you smile and gasp at all the right points, and the heroes win. What makes Coppola's movies great is when he doesn't make them safe. Most people would say this is a better film than One From The Heart, but not me - while that movie may have its flaws too, it's completely original and unlike anything else; it's an artist putting himself on the line (and in that instance getting savaged for it) but injecting his soul into his art. The Rainmaker is a solid bet, an agreeable thriller, but unlike its director it's nothing special.

    It starts out well enough, with a finely orchestrated first hour during which we are introduced to some genuinely compelling characters, including an impressively subdued but very potent Mickey Rourke as Bruiser Stone, the flashy first boss of newly minted kid lawyer Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon), and an extremely vibrant Danny DeVito as a less than virtuous but endearing lawyer wanna-be, Deck Shifflet. There are tender and poignant performances by supporting players, such as Johnny Whitworth as the leukemia stricken Donny Ray Black. The role of Donny's mother is finely handled by Mary Kay Place, her naturally blithe spirit suppressed in a character of considerable depth and subtle inflection. Claire Danes as Kelly Riker, a stoic victim of domestic abuse, proves herself equal to any other working actress. Rudy's non-relationship with Kelly only magnifies the immensity of the good boy's complete total awesomeness. Eventually the increasingly manipulative story wears itself out, the mounting heap of standard court room drama clich&eacute;s just too expansive an obstacle for me to navigate. This film had pretty much drained all my accounts by the 90 minute mark, but there were still another 45 minutes of bilking, such as the appearance of a key witness whose insider information threatens to incriminate the evil large corporation. Virgina Madsen is convincing in the part, but her fine contribution is undermined by the film's insistently maudlin tactics. No sooner had she delivered her moving testimony - count to four - and the poor girl is exposed as the scornful rejected lover of the nasty company man. Her character is further impugned by her own admission that she traded sex for corporate privilege, but only because it was demanded of her. Even a perfectly green, wet behind the ears, newbie lawyer would have sense enough to thoroughly check out a star witness' background, and if not Rudy, than certainly the crafty Deck Shifflet. But Rudy's improbable incompetence was already established in his first appearance before a judge where he didn't have the single slightest clue of courtroom procedure, despite 3 or 4 years of law school experience. Oh right, it was a modest, second rate, non Ivy League school. Maybe the school advertised on the back of match books? If Danny Glover as the mercifully decent replacement judge can't win me back into the film's corner, then maybe a comically sweatered Roy Sheider can. He's a dependable source of fine drama, but his minor bit is too little too late to save this con job that doesn't even have sense enough to end when its over. It just keeps plodding on and on, tripping over at least two or three endings before it finally trickles out, collapsed under its own ponderous weight. I don't know who to despise more - me for having allowed myself to be roped into this tedious swindle, or the shameless driver of this fraudulent car wreck. Remind me again just who is its two-faced, fork-tongued shyster director?!

    Lawyer movies are only worth watching if they are well done, and The Rainmaker is one of those movies. Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon) is a young lawyer straight out of law school and desperate for work. While learning the legal ropes under a crooked lawyer, Bruiser Stone (Mickey Rourke), Rudy takes on the case of Donny Ray Black (Johnny Whitworth) a young boy stricken with leukemia and his medical claims denied by his insurance company. What follows is a typical case of the little guy vs. big corporate greed, but what makes the story watchable and not clich&eacute; is the wonderful cast and acting. The players include John Voight as the sleazy corporate lawyer, Dean Stockwell as the corrupt judge in the pocket of the corporate world, Danny DeVito as Matt Damon's legal assistant/would be lawyer that can't seem to pass the bar exam, and Danny Glover as the anti-corporate judge whose rulings help Matt Damon bring the case to trial. The movie does a good job of presenting the ebb and flow of the case, he audience's opinion of guilt or innocence sways with each new witness and legal maneuver, until the final bombshell is dropped and the case is easily decided. To sum it up, the story is a bit clich&eacute; yet well told, the characters are similarly clich&eacute; yet well acted, and the ending is typical of Hollywood yet rewarding. In all The Rainmaker is a textbook example of a formula movie where attention to detail, characters, and plot make it better than it really is.

    My problems with it include the overall sappy tone, which marred Matt Damon's otherwise good performance as a rookie lawyer with a Southern twang. It was amusing to see him struggle, and Danny DeVito's character seemed to drive the picture. The plot was on the weak side of things, and it was tame for a John Grisham story. I was also expecting more out of Coppola post-Godfather. I'm glad that the good guys win and everybody feels better once the evil insurance company goes bankrupt. It was heartwarming, but I was expecting more intrigue and suspense. When it didn't come, it made Rudy's narration unnecessary and irritating. Danny Glover felt miscast as the judge, and Jon Voight wasn't allowed much time to shine. I was expecting an intense scene between him and Damon once the lawsuit intensified. The romance felt superfluous because the scenes with the Black family and the old lady show that Rudy cares about people. It was time better suited for conspiracy and chaos, especially since it all seems pointless as the wife gets spared by the DA. Rudy's buddies kept telling him to be careful, but I was left asking why because the bad guys only seemed to care about winning the case as opposed to escalating things with violence like any other Grisham story I've seen. I initially thought Bruiser (Mickey Rourke) would be the antagonist with something to hide, and frankly he was more intimidating and interesting than Great Benefit Insurance. However, it was still enjoyable. I would give it a 7 out of 10.

    This one gets three stars because the formula works to some extent every time. But clearly there is a story to tell behind this movie. FFC took this one on as a hired gun. His script is limp - one of the worst closing arguments in the history of courtroom drama. The script is credited to FFC with "narration" by a third party. The over-dubbing of dialog and the addition of a pointless narration, the half-told subplots and the rearrangement of events in the book all point to a desperate resuscitation attempt in post. I am amazed they kept Elmer Bernstein's music, which makes you feel like you are watching an episode of Mannix. And why is Danny Glover uncredited, when he has a major role? I love Coppola's movies, but his heart clearly was not in this one.

    Unless you have read John Grisham's novel, you probably will not enjoy the film adaption of The Rainmaker, which is as slow and boring as courtroom dramas come. Perhaps the only redeeming aspect is the talents of Danny DeVito, cast as Rudy's ever-scheming partner, Deck. The most frustrating aspect of the film is that the characters are all cast properly, but the actors did not reach their full potential due to sloppy editing and an incredibly slow-paced plot. Granted, this is a courtroom drama, not an action movie, but the plot is so fragmented that it's hard to stay focused on the Great Benefits Insurance case. Although true to the book, the Miss Birdie and forbidden love subplots bog down the film with slow, uneventful scenes that do little to challenge Rudy's beliefs and substantially strengthen him as a character. If you've read the book, then you may enjoy this adaption for what it's worth--namely, DeVito's acting and a few lawyer jokes to pocket for later. http://bitesizemoviereview.blogspot.com/

    Having recently graduated from law school at the University of Memphis and unable to find lucrative employment, an earnest, idealistic young lawyer (Damon) begins working for a ruthless ambulance chaser (Rourke), then finds himself going head-to-head with an unscrupulous insurance company and its smarmy, overpaid legal defense team (led by Voight) after they failed to pay a claim for a young man diagnosed with leukemia. At the same time, the lawyer finds some degree of solace by becoming the unofficial "protector" of a battered woman (Danes). Superbly cast, with pitch-perfect performances, sure-handed direction, and good, intelligent storytelling. A bit on the long side, but still a well-made and respectable adaptation of John Grisham's novel. ***

    Francis Ford Coppola is both scriptwriter and director of this film entitled,The Rainmaker. It was adapted from the John Grisham novel about broke, inexperienced Memphis law-school graduate Rudy Baylor.It stars Matt Damon as Rudy Baylor together with an ensemble cast namely: Danny DeVito, Danny Glover, Claire Danes, Jon Voight, Roy Scheider, Mickey Rourke, Virginia Madsen,Mary Kay Place and Teresa Wright in her final film. Rudy Baylor, ready to take any job he can find. Signing on with slimy Bruiser Stone, he learns ambulance-chasing tactics from Bruiser's leg man Deck Schifflet and meets battered teen Kelly Riker (Claire Danes), abused by her husband. Baylor has his own clients -- friendly Miss Birdie, who has a large estate to dispose of, and desperate Dot Black, whose son Donnie Ray has terminal leukemia. Medical intervention could have spared his life, but the Great Benefit Insurance Company denied coverage, preventing Donnie Ray from getting a life-saving bone marrow transplant. Rudy finds a place to live in the apartment behind Miss Birdie's house. Deck and Rudy split from Bruiser to start their small firm. When they take on the Blacks' case, they go up against the insurance company's high-priced law firm and are continually thwarted by slick lawyer Leo F. Drummond. Coppola has infused The Rainmaker with enough humor, character, honest emotion and storytelling style to make it a very entertaining movie.Aside from that,the story is characterized with intelligence and subtlety that makes it interesting from beginning to end.Aside from that,the cast performed very well.Special mention should be given to Jon Voight and Danny DeVito. While Matt Damon did certainly provide great acting as the young Rudy Baylor. This legal drama is definitely one of the best that Grisham has ever written and Coppola has ever filmed.

    I firmly believe in this statement since: how come an truly and realistic great film with an excellent cast, directed by one of the most respected film directors of all time, is barely mentioned by people, almost unknown to many film viewers and also (as for my country) never shown on TV? It was released in theaters here but for a short time. I've never heard of this film being on regular TV and not even in cable TV, and the closer I get of this film was seeing the DVD somewhere, and unfortunately I haven't bought it. And to found it on the internet was even the hardest task ever but it's certainly rewarding. I'm not much into conspiracy theories but I really think someone's hiding this film from viewers. Who could it be? Maybe Paramount itself, company that distributes this film isn't much interested in making it more available for exhibitions or selling. But the danger of "The Rainmaker" lies in a story about bringing risky and millionaire lawsuits against health insurance companies, and (here comes the conspiracy theory which I was referring), but maybe the real companies are paying Paramount to hide this film in the best possible way. The film remains criminally underrated despite having some favorable things about it. In "The Rainmaker", Matt Damon plays Rudy Baylor, an promising and idealistic young lawyer, graduated from Harvard, trying his way into the law business working in a revolting case against Great Benefit, an health insurance company that denied an bone marrow transplant of Donny Ray, a young man dying of leukemia, something that was covered in their policy. Baylor's test is not only in this trial, fighting against Leo F. Drummond (an impeccable and inspiring Jon Voight) and his team of lawyers defending Great Benefit but also in dealing with his boss (Mickey Rourke), involved in some illicit business; with his partner Deck (Danny DeVito) who'll be of great help in bringing testimonies for his case and showing how justice and law really works outside of what law schools teach; and a semi-romantic affair he has with Kelly (Claire Danes), victim of an abusive husband he mets. And believe me, the film never slows down its rhythm at any of these segments, they're all interesting. It's a story about a man fighting for what he believes in a troubled, dangerous, greedy and unethical world but he also needs to make some tricks in order to survive in this same world. His first client before Donny Ray's family is a guy involved in car accidents and who don't have a lawyer to represent them in legal assistance (but it's not something Rudy gets proud of). Rudy is also counts with luck to get things done, I mean, who could have thought that the original Judge selected for this case (and not much friendly with Rudy and his case) would collapse and die, being substituted by a more correct and friendly Judge (Danny Glover)? Like I said, all the segments were interestingly well made but the one that really captures all of our attention (and this is a must when it comes in films like these) is the whole trial. Here's an exciting, electrifying trial and obviously there's surprises (the appearance of a key witness, played by Virginia Madsen), twists and turns, some funny moments and the most interesting aspect of all, it shows how the legal system works, it digs deep into tiny little things that can make a huge difference between winning and losing a court battle. Despite this being directed by Francis Ford Coppola, in one of his attempts to pay for all the costs of the troubled and overbugeted "One From the Heart", which might sound like an film made for giving return in box-office less than being an intelligent and artistic film, "The Rainmaker" contains countless characteristics of his skillful direction, it's filmed and edited in a great style (one of those things that when you look back and watch the films made in the 1990's and then look at the ones made now, you feel the nostalgic feeling that, somehow, the films back then were better and this is a great example of that), followed by a nice soundtrack, and of course, the gigantic group of talented actors present here which also includes small appearances of Roy Scheider, Theresa Wright and Dean Stockwell, all in very good roles.

It was heartwarming, but I was expecting more intrigue and suspense. When it didn't come, it made Rudy's narration unnecessary and irritating. Danny Glover felt miscast as the judge, and Jon Voight wasn't allowed much time to shine. I was expecting an intense scene between him and Damon once the lawsuit intensified. The romance felt superfluous because the scenes with the Black family and the old lady show that Rudy cares about people. It was time better suited for conspiracy and chaos, especially since it all seems pointless as the wife gets spared by the DA. Rudy's buddies kept telling him to be careful, but I was left asking why because the bad guys only seemed to care about winning the case as opposed to escalating things with violence like any other Grisham story I've seen. I initially thought Bruiser (Mickey Rourke) would be the antagonist with something to hide, and frankly he was more intimidating and interesting than Great Benefit Insurance. However, it was still enjoyable. I would give it a 7 out of 10.

    This one gets three stars because the formula works to some extent every time. But clearly there is a story to tell behind this movie. FFC took this one on as a hired gun. His script is limp - one of the worst closing arguments in the history of courtroom drama. The script is credited to FFC with "narration" by a third party. The over-dubbing of dialog and the addition of a pointless narration, the half-told subplots and the rearrangement of events in the book all point to a desperate resuscitation attempt in post. I am amazed they kept Elmer Bernstein's music, which makes you feel like you are watching an episode of Mannix. And why is Danny Glover uncredited, when he has a major role? I love Coppola's movies, but his heart clearly was not in this one.

    Unless you have read John Grisham's novel, you probably will not enjoy the film adaption of The Rainmaker, which is as slow and boring as courtroom dramas come. Perhaps the only redeeming aspect is the talents of Danny DeVito, cast as Rudy's ever-scheming partner, Deck. The most frustrating aspect of the film is that the characters are all cast properly, but the actors did not reach their full potential due to sloppy editing and an incredibly slow-paced plot. Granted, this is a courtroom drama, not an action movie, but the plot is so fragmented that it's hard to stay focused on the Great Benefits Insurance case. Although true to the book, the Miss Birdie and forbidden love subplots bog down the film with slow, uneventful scenes that do little to challenge Rudy's beliefs and substantially strengthen him as a character. If you've read the book, then you may enjoy this adaption for what it's worth--namely, DeVito's acting and a few lawyer jokes to pocket for later. http://bitesizemoviereview.blogspot.com/

    Having recently graduated from law school at the University of Memphis and unable to find lucrative employment, an earnest, idealistic young lawyer (Damon) begins working for a ruthless ambulance chaser (Rourke), then finds himself going head-to-head with an unscrupulous insurance company and its smarmy, overpaid legal defense team (led by Voight) after they failed to pay a claim for a young man diagnosed with leukemia. At the same time, the lawyer finds some degree of solace by becoming the unofficial "protector" of a battered woman (Danes). Superbly cast, with pitch-perfect performances, sure-handed direction, and good, intelligent storytelling. A bit on the long side, but still a well-made and respectable adaptation of John Grisham's novel. ***

    Francis Ford Coppola is both scriptwriter and director of this film entitled,The Rainmaker. It was adapted from the John Grisham novel about broke, inexperienced Memphis law-school graduate Rudy Baylor.It stars Matt Damon as Rudy Baylor together with an ensemble cast namely: Danny DeVito, Danny Glover, Claire Danes, Jon Voight, Roy Scheider, Mickey Rourke, Virginia Madsen,Mary Kay Place and Teresa Wright in her final film. Rudy Baylor, ready to take any job he can find. Signing on with slimy Bruiser Stone, he learns ambulance-chasing tactics from Bruiser's leg man Deck Schifflet and meets battered teen Kelly Riker (Claire Danes), abused by her husband. Baylor has his own clients -- friendly Miss Birdie, who has a large estate to dispose of, and desperate Dot Black, whose son Donnie Ray has terminal leukemia. Medical intervention could have spared his life, but the Great Benefit Insurance Company denied coverage, preventing Donnie Ray from getting a life-saving bone marrow transplant. Rudy finds a place to live in the apartment behind Miss Birdie's house. Deck and Rudy split from Bruiser to start their small firm. When they take on the Blacks' case, they go up against the insurance company's high-priced law firm and are continually thwarted by slick lawyer Leo F. Drummond. Coppola has infused The Rainmaker with enough humor, character, honest emotion and storytelling style to make it a very entertaining movie.Aside from that,the story is characterized with intelligence and subtlety that makes it interesting from beginning to end.Aside from that,the cast performed very well.Special mention should be given to Jon Voight and Danny DeVito. While Matt Damon did certainly provide great acting as the young Rudy Baylor. This legal drama is definitely one of the best that Grisham has ever written and Coppola has ever filmed.

    I firmly believe in this statement since: how come an truly and realistic great film with an excellent cast, directed by one of the most respected film directors of all time, is barely mentioned by people, almost unknown to many film viewers and also (as for my country) never shown on TV? It was released in theaters here but for a short time. I've never heard of this film being on regular TV and not even in cable TV, and the closer I get of this film was seeing the DVD somewhere, and unfortunately I haven't bought it. And to found it on the internet was even the hardest task ever but it's certainly rewarding. I'm not much into conspiracy theories but I really think someone's hiding this film from viewers. Who could it be? Maybe Paramount itself, company that distributes this film isn't much interested in making it more available for exhibitions or selling. But the danger of "The Rainmaker" lies in a story about bringing risky and millionaire lawsuits against health insurance companies, and (here comes the conspiracy theory which I was referring), but maybe the real companies are paying Paramount to hide this film in the best possible way. The film remains criminally underrated despite having some favorable things about it. In "The Rainmaker", Matt Damon plays Rudy Baylor, an promising and idealistic young lawyer, graduated from Harvard, trying his way into the law business working in a revolting case against Great Benefit, an health insurance company that denied an bone marrow transplant of Donny Ray, a young man dying of leukemia, something that was covered in their policy. Baylor's test is not only in this trial, fighting against Leo F. Drummond (an impeccable and inspiring Jon Voight) and his team of lawyers defending Great Benefit but also in dealing with his boss (Mickey Rourke), involved in some illicit business; with his partner Deck (Danny DeVito) who'll be of great help in bringing testimonies for his case and showing how justice and law really works outside of what law schools teach; and a semi-romantic affair he has with Kelly (Claire Danes), victim of an abusive husband he mets. And believe me, the film never slows down its rhythm at any of these segments, they're all interesting. It's a story about a man fighting for what he believes in a troubled, dangerous, greedy and unethical world but he also needs to make some tricks in order to survive in this same world. His first client before Donny Ray's family is a guy involved in car accidents and who don't have a lawyer to represent them in legal assistance (but it's not something Rudy gets proud of). Rudy is also counts with luck to get things done, I mean, who could have thought that the original Judge selected for this case (and not much friendly with Rudy and his case) would collapse and die, being substituted by a more correct and friendly Judge (Danny Glover)? Like I said, all the segments were interestingly well made but the one that really captures all of our attention (and this is a must when it comes in films like these) is the whole trial. Here's an exciting, electrifying trial and obviously there's surprises (the appearance of a key witness, played by Virginia Madsen), twists and turns, some funny moments and the most interesting aspect of all, it shows how the legal system works, it digs deep into tiny little things that can make a huge difference between winning and losing a court battle. Despite this being directed by Francis Ford Coppola, in one of his attempts to pay for all the costs of the troubled and overbugeted "One From the Heart", which might sound like an film made for giving return in box-office less than being an intelligent and artistic film, "The Rainmaker" contains countless characteristics of his skillful direction, it's filmed and edited in a great style (one of those things that when you look back and watch the films made in the 1990's and then look at the ones made now, you feel the nostalgic feeling that, somehow, the films back then were better and this is a great example of that), followed by a nice soundtrack, and of course, the gigantic group of talented actors present here which also includes small appearances of Roy Scheider, Theresa Wright and Dean Stockwell, all in very good roles. Based on a John Grisham novel (he considers this his favorite film of all film adaptations of his work), this courtroom thriller is brilliantly memorable and it has one of the most original and realistic endings ever presented in films like these, it might look like an obvious clich&eacute; but then you have to wait to see more of what's about to come. Find this movie if you can and watch it right away. 10/10

    Very surprised this move ranked so low. It has a stellar cast, an interesting plot and some witty dialogue. Perhaps the subject matter is too "left of centre" for some, skewing votes lower? Matt Damon plays the young, inexperienced lawyer with a conscience very well. John Voight is equally adept as the big time corporate lawyer who's sold his soul to protect the interests of a multi-million dollar insurance company. The company is sued by a small, poor family whose son is dying of leukaemia and is denied insurance by the big bad company despite having a policy. Intertwined with that plot line is one where Damon becomes too involved with a battered wife and ends up rescuing her from her abusive husband. Movie is very well acted. The storyline flows but not too fast. It takes on the character of a slow southern drawl which is perfect since that is where it is set. 8/10.

    Rudy Baylor is a greenhorn lawyer in Memphis who lands a sensational case - a young man dying of leukaemia whose insurance company refuses to pay out. Can inexperienced Rudy take on the fat cat corporate sharks and dish out some justice ? This is a polished, well made, well acted courtroom drama from a bestselling novel by John Grisham, whose legal thrillers were very popular in the nineties (The Firm, The Pelican Brief, The Client). I'm afraid however I don't think much of the plot - greedy insurance company versus terminally ill kid coughing up blood is a bit too hackneyed for me, and when it throws in fisticuffs with the jury, company documents with mysterious missing bits, and last minute witnesses having affairs with the defendants, my Credibility Proximity Warning lights start to flash. It also has a lengthy subplot involving a battered wife which is touching but has precisely zero relevance. In my view, stories should be tight, focused and original, and I'm not convinced Grisham's are. That said the characters are rich and the drama has some good points to make about the legal exploitation of the US working class, as well as many funny scenes, like the one where DeVito walks down to the hospital and presses his card into the hands of patients in traction. Its strongest suit is the cast - Damon is suitably bewildered and well-intentioned, DeVito holds everything together as the shyster evidence man, Voight is toothy and evil as the corporate pit bull, an unbilled Glover is the judge, Madsen (Dune, Candyman) has an eye-catching part as a bitter and sullied ex-executive, the late great Scheider shows up at the end as the CEO, and Coppola alumni Rourke and Stockwell shine in off-the-wall parts as a mumbling one-step-away-from-prison legal embezzler and a bad-tempered emphysemic judge with a very short life expectancy respectively. The batty old bird is played by Teresa Wright, the young star of several forties classics (such as Hitchcock's Shadow Of A Doubt), aged seventy-seven and making her final film, and West in the small part of the Dad shows how it's possible to create a thought-provoking and fully-fledged character with literally no dialogue. They're all fun to watch strutting their stuff and riffing off each other. In the end though, this is a disappointing movie for me, purely because its scope falls well short of its director's talent. It's a good movie, but it's a safe movie - it looks familiar, it makes you smile and gasp at all the right points, and the heroes win. What makes Coppola's movies great is when he doesn't make them safe. Most people would say this is a better film than One From The Heart, but not me - while that movie may have its flaws too, it's completely original and unlike anything else; it's an artist putting himself on the line (and in that instance getting savaged for it) but injecting his soul into his art. The Rainmaker is a solid bet, an agreeable thriller, but unlike its director it's nothing special.

    It starts out well enough, with a finely orchestrated first hour during which we are introduced to some genuinely compelling characters, including an impressively subdued but very potent Mickey Rourke as Bruiser Stone, the flashy first boss of newly minted kid lawyer Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon), and an extremely vibrant Danny DeVito as a less than virtuous but endearing lawyer wanna-be, Deck Shifflet. There are tender and poignant performances by supporting players, such as Johnny Whitworth as the leukemia stricken Donny Ray Black. The role of Donny's mother is finely handled by Mary Kay Place, her naturally blithe spirit suppressed in a character of considerable depth and subtle inflection. Claire Danes as Kelly Riker, a stoic victim of domestic abuse, proves herself equal to any other working actress. Rudy's non-relationship with Kelly only magnifies the immensity of the good boy's complete total awesomeness. Eventually the increasingly manipulative story wears itself out, the mounting heap of standard court room drama clich&eacute;s just too expansive an obstacle for me to navigate. This film had pretty much drained all my accounts by the 90 minute mark, but there were still another 45 minutes of bilking, such as the appearance of a key witness whose insider information threatens to incriminate the evil large corporation. Virgina Madsen is convincing in the part, but her fine contribution is undermined by the film's insistently maudlin tactics. No sooner had she delivered her moving testimony - count to four - and the poor girl is exposed as the scornful rejected lover of the nasty company man. Her character is further impugned by her own admission that she traded sex for corporate privilege, but only because it was demanded of her. Even a perfectly green, wet behind the ears, newbie lawyer would have sense enough to thoroughly check out a star witness' background, and if not Rudy, than certainly the crafty Deck Shifflet. But Rudy's improbable incompetence was already established in his first appearance before a judge where he didn't have the single slightest clue of courtroom procedure, despite 3 or 4 years of law school experience. Oh right, it was a modest, second rate, non Ivy League school. Maybe the school advertised on the back of match books? If Danny Glover as the mercifully decent replacement judge can't win me back into the film's corner, then maybe a comically sweatered Roy Sheider can. He's a dependable source of fine drama, but his minor bit is too little too late to save this con job that doesn't even have sense enough to end when its over. It just keeps plodding on and on, tripping over at least two or three endings before it finally trickles out, collapsed under its own ponderous weight. I don't know who to despise more - me for having allowed myself to be roped into this tedious swindle, or the shameless driver of this fraudulent car wreck. Remind me again just who is its two-faced, fork-tongued shyster director?!

    Lawyer movies are only worth watching if they are well done, and The Rainmaker is one of those movies. Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon) is a young lawyer straight out of law school and desperate for work. While learning the legal ropes under a crooked lawyer, Bruiser Stone (Mickey Rourke), Rudy takes on the case of Donny Ray Black (Johnny Whitworth) a young boy stricken with leukemia and his medical claims denied by his insurance company. What follows is a typical case of the little guy vs. big corporate greed, but what makes the story watchable and not clich&eacute; is the wonderful cast and acting. The players include John Voight as the sleazy corporate lawyer, Dean Stockwell as the corrupt judge in the pocket of the corporate world, Danny DeVito as Matt Damon's legal assistant/would be lawyer that can't seem to pass the bar exam, and Danny Glover as the anti-corporate judge whose rulings help Matt Damon bring the case to trial. The movie does a good job of presenting the ebb and flow of the case, he audience's opinion of guilt or innocence sways with each new witness and legal maneuver, until the final bombshell is dropped and the case is easily decided. To sum it up, the story is a bit clich&eacute; yet well told, the characters are similarly clich&eacute; yet well acted, and the ending is typical of Hollywood yet rewarding. In all The Rainmaker is a textbook example of a formula movie where attention to detail, characters, and plot make it better than it really is.
