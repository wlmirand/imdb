    My mother gave me this movie on DVD as a present, since I love stoner comedies. This had potential, it had an all-star cast, a reputable director, and a catchy title. The first twelve minutes were promising, high school is almost over and the story seemed to be going in a positive direction. After those precious twelve minutes, this movie went completely downhill. There was no plot whatsoever, zero conflict, and undeveloped characters, things you do not want in a classic film. I was disappointed and I had never been so bored in my life watching a "comedy" that felt like an eternity to finish. There is only ONE funny scene worth watching and that's the part where the hippie talks about George Washington smoking weed. Other than that, I cannot believe this project got made in the first place. It doesn't even count as a real movie, but I digress! If you want to watch an overrated movie that is boring and has no redeeming qualities to it, then this is the movie for you. I'm glad I shared my opinion and by the way, I sold the DVD after watching this piece of garbage for the third time.

    Loved this movie when it came out, but with each successive viewing it seems smaller and less than its first impression. Undeniably, the Criterion package is beautiful (the booklet worth the price alone), but I'm surprised that they chose to put this film out at all. The nighttime cinematography is a serious thing of beauty, the performances are mostly good to brilliant, the music plumbs the depths of 70's trash rock with curatorial zeal. Still somehow, the finished product cruises about midway between the offhand brilliance of American Graffiti and the adolescent goofs of Porky's. Watching the deleted scenes, I think it may be that the movie just isn't long enough. What did they leave out? The girls, of course. With the bulk of screen time spent with the male characters - hazing and being hazed, the hardships of being a jock AND a freak, drink and drug rants. Why no room for the other, equally looped perspective which was actually filmed? Kaye's ongoing rants about sexism and politics followed by Shavonne's mockery were unnecessarily, ridiculously sacrificed (the actresses must have been livid when they saw they finished product). Why - for the sake of a tidy run time? It's a shame, and the final edit mimics Lucas's AG so precisely in neglecting the actresses (seldom on screen unless they're relating to a male character) that it almost seems programmatic (read: studio mandate - girls are boring). Maybe it wasn't outside interference, but I have some hope that Linklater will someday sit down and eek out a longer cut. And while he's at it replace that last throw away shot through the windshield. What the heck is that? Looks like Slater grabbed the camera, for chrissakes. By the way, the reviewer who said the depiction was Not Realistic At All - he graduated in 73 and clearly missed all that shortly followed. The mid-seventies were a hybridizing period. Every guy but the scuzziest badass had a slick nylon button up shirt, even people who hated disco. Hippie style was subverted/perverted by consumer culture, the natural look gone cartoon tawdry. The worst thing you could do in 1976 was try too hard (see if you can sell that to today's crop of attention seekers). Everyone looked ridiculous, but mellow ridiculous. No, the look and styling of this film is pretty spot-on, though everyone is too clean and the girl's makeup is way too flattering (mascara in the seventies was so globby it looked like spiders died on your eyes). Also, the main character's ride between the two social camps was one of the subtle touches that really made the movie work for me. Stoners were called freaks, and jocks who did drugs were frocks. There were plenty at my suburban nowhere school - one of them was a homecoming attendant and a well known (to the students) user. It made him popular with everyone, not unlike Randy Floyd. Sorry man - you checked out a little too early to authenticate this party buzz.

    Not sure where to begin with this movie. I first saw it at around 1am with my older brother around 2001 and as soon as the end credits rolled we watched it all over again. I've now seen Dazed and Confused over 30 times and it never fails to entertain me. Entertain is the wrong word. The best word that describes this movie (for me anyway) is 'feeling'. Its a feeling. I wasn't even born until the early 80s but there's something about this movie that just captures my childhood. Probably that summer feeling. Again that word pops up. The characters, soundtrack, setting. Its just perfect. Everything i never knew i wanted in a film all lining up to capture a feeling i never want to forget. Whether i experienced the same as the characters or not i just can't help but watch this movie over and over again. Whether it be in the background while i'm procrastinating or i if i just want to 'feel'. Again these words don't really begin to sum up my true feelings about this movie. I just can't explain it. Its a special film and no other film will probably ever make me feel this way ever again.

    Often referred to as a cult classic, Dazed and Confused lives up to its name in every way. After his excellent directorial debut, Richard Linklater, who was considered an important up-and-coming director hit every right note in his second feature, cementing his status as one of America's most exciting filmmakers. Even today, the film holds up really well and makes for a non-stop entertaining picture. The film takes place in the 1970's over the course of one day, the last day of school. Seniors have now officially finished and they are looking for new freshman to 'initiate' which they usually do by means of bullying. Its something that would not fly today but very easily could have been tradition in the past. Where the film strives in its realism is in what these kids do on this last day of school, they party. And a filmmaker like Linklater is perfect for this because of his gift to let characters just walk in and out of the frame and follow a collective group instead of just a few characters. He doesn't just make a few characters stand out, he gives the whole school character. The film stars some actors that are a lot more well known currently than when this film was released, such as Ben Affleck, Matthew McConaughey, so on and so forth. The entire cast turns in serviceable performances and it makes for one of the more entertaining ensembles to come out of the 90s. With a cast as large as this, it could be easy to make the film too clouded and unfocused, but this is one of Linklater's specialties. He captures an important human connection on film that resonates with us viewers and its part of the large voice he has in American independent cinema. Linklater appropriately uses music in this film. He chooses songs that we're all familiar with and plays them amongst parts where they're most appropriate; such as playing School's Out by Alice Cooper when school is actually out. Its obvious but fitting since these songs were huge during this time period and it accurately captures the feel of that era. Here we aren't exposed to over-the-top 70's clothing and disco-influenced culture, but we get familiarized with a setting where we could easily see our parents growing up in. The film thrives with realism. This may be Linklater's most mainstream-appealing independent feature as a director. Slacker could be pretty divisive, its lack of plot could throw off a lot of viewers. Dazed and Confused also doesn't have much of a plot but this film appeals to a large group of people because of how well Linklater captured a familiar experience onto film to which we can all relate to. It makes for one of the most enjoyable films to come from the 90's and stands out as one of the director's most accomplished features.

    I went to high school in the early 70s. D&C does capture some of the fun of that era before AIDS, 9-11, Homeland Security, locker searches or much of the junk we put up with in 2013. In the Northeast we never had Freshman hazing, so I found that stuff a bit hard to relate to. I read here that was common in Texas high schools. I would recommend D&C not as great filmmaking but simply a fun look back at high school in a unique time that only lasted a few years. For young people that want to get a feel for the 70s, watch this film. Also see Fast Times at Ridgemont High and the first two seasons of That 70s Show. Freaking awesome, dude!

    That's the thing about movies, man, no matter how many times I watch them they stay the exact same. Alright, alright, alright, it's the beginning of summer for me so that can only mean one thing. I watched Dazed and Confused. The year is 1976 and it is the first day of summer. Seniors abuse freshman and then go party. This is the story of one wild and crazy night from many different perspectives. This was a classic and it is timeless. There is everything in this movie from stoners to nerds to jocks to normal people. You get a sense of what high school was like back in the day. The main characters are Pink, the senior quarterback, and Mitch the upcoming freshman. There a lot of other lovable characters like the creepy Matthew McConaughey , the big bully Ben Affleck, and everything in-between. Pink is pressured from coaches to sign a waiver for next year's season and he doesn't know what he wants to do. This is a subtle problem that carries throughout the entire movie, which adds a spice to the movie. Mitch struggles with the annual beating from the seniors but soon comes to his own and finds out what high school is all about. The high school atmosphere in the 70s was incredible, I almost wish I was 18 back then. The stuff these kids got away with. The way they acted in school on the last day with the smoking weed outside and throwing papers everywhere. The group of guys is driving and take trash barrels and destroy mail boxes. Something like that would never happen today. The most disturbing scene was the hazing of the freshman girls. They poured ketchup and mustard on them and made them all gross. Hazing is a terrible thing but at least the movie made it funny. It is weird how they can abuse them one second and then a few hours later they are parrying with the girls they abused. The 70s was a weird decade. The 70s was a messed up decade but it did have killer music. Every scene had a perfect editing of music. Everything from Zeppelin to Ozzy to Kansas. The school bell rings and Alice Cooper's Schools Out blares and it was picture perfect. Music makes a movie, I say it all the time, music makes the movie, and the music made this movie. There was no original score, which is a little strange, but I knew every song they played and I love that kind of music so it made me very happy. My favorite character was the biggest stoner I have ever seen on the big screen. I forget his name but he has the long hair and the backwards cap and he is high in very scene. He speaks complete nonsense about the founding fathers and the cosmos and it is hilarious. It is between him and the Jewish guy from Saving Private Ryan. He plays a nerd who rambles on and on. Sometimes he makes sense and sometimes you just want him to shut up. His character has a lot of development and his group of friends is entertaining. So let's break this movie down. The plot is fantastic, the scenes themselves are well put together and there is really no boring part. There are a lot of characters so it can be a little difficult to follow but all are unique and mesh together perfectly. The acting wasn't remarkable but for the purpose of the movie it worked. The movie isn't really about the story or the deep emotions of the characters. It is strictly about the crazy antics of high school seniors. It is a night we all wish we could have. There are a few reality checks and unbelievable moments but overall a lot of fun. There isn't really much more that can be said about this movie other than it is a movie you need to see if you haven't. Overall, Dazed and Confused is timeless fun that can be enjoyed by anyone. It shows the ease of summer and in a way defined a decade. The music was great, the story was good enough, the acting was fine, it was funny, touching, and a lot of fun. I love this movie and I can see it anywhere, anytime. This is a great movie to see with friends, it is probably better with friends and is also a good background movie at party of something. I suggest you don't look into this movie too much but rather enjoy it for what it is, mindless fun. Dazed and Confused gets the WillyT Honorable Mention., so go watch it and enjoy and remember the days of drinking as a kid.

    There's really no story but it's not necessary for this flick; it's more of a hang-out movie. The movie brings you to the last day of school and summer is just around the corner. You get to see teens having fun, drinking beer and smoking pot. This is a time machine for everyone that was a teen in the 70's. The movie has a great soundtrack that I enjoyed to the fullest, especially when they end the movie with Slater sitting in the backseat of a Chevelle blowing out marijuana smoke while the Chevelle drives towards the horizon with Foghat's Slow Ride playing in the background. It's a really cool movie and I think every teen should watch it at least once in their lifetime. I give it a 10 because it's a great movie and I can relate so much to it.

    After watching Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise, Sunset I was moved and looked up his other movies and this title caught my attention. I got it and saw it recently. The plot is one which we all can connect with, which is the last day of school (probably not the part where all the drinking and smoking, getting wasted, laid happens). The craziness, rawness, carelessness of youth at that point of time is displayed on screen with much clarity. The dialogs are well written. The characters are all unique and have all performed well. We can connect to each of the character in the movie. Some are nerds, discussing deep, philosophical matters, theories, etc, who are decent and less violent as compared to the other groups. Some are violent, rash, rude and have all those character traits of a person, our parents warn us to stay away from. They make a joke of authority, care least about their own future and get involved in drugs, smoking, drinking etc. There's a line by a character in the movie which goes something on the lines of "if life's so short then we should enjoy it to the maximum while we are alive". Some kids take it too seriously and ruin their lives. I almost felt like talking to these kids and telling them its not the way of life, and that they are wasting their lives' best days. But then they would scoff at any such idea which stops them from enjoying. Some parts are very funny. Whenever Slater comes on screen, its hilarious. And there are parts where we can see how vulnerable some of the characters are to find someone to fall in love with. There is some great sound tracks running in the background which sets the mood for the 70's. Some great dialogs too. There is no conclusion shown but that bitter-sweet period is captured brilliantly. I rate it 7/10.

    All I knew about this film was that it was a pot smoking, 1970's-set film starring Matthew McConaughey. After finally seeing the nearly 20-year old film, I was virtually left Dazed and Confused on the only other "fact" I knew about it: this was supposed to be a comedy. This movie NEVER made me laugh. I will admit it did have me snickering a few times, namely a pregnant woman who was simultaneously smoking and being lectured on the healthy habits of calcium and another girl getting her tight jean's zipper up with pliers. Other than that, I found absolutely nothing funny about the lame story of horny and disorderly punks leaving their junior year of high school and entering summer, all in one night. Allow me to back track, I'm guessing some of this is about Juniors in High School, and some about Seniors. My suspicion was that this was SUPPOSED to be about seniors, as some of the graffiti and Junior High Abuse indicated, but the majority were being coached on their final year in High School and their football careers. So, I guess this was about all ages  Junior High to Freshmen to Juniors in High School to Seniors to Already Graduated Losers. Was that the intention of the writers? Not sure, but I am sure, I only saw this as a drama about a bunch of unruly, irresponsible adolescences who spend one night in May drinking, pot-smoking, complaining and destroying lives and property for the sole purpose ofnothing. So much so, there was a great quote two-thirds in and I love it when a character sums up the movie in the dialogue: "Fairly uneventful, huh?" Yep, that defines the movie. Heck, despite the clich&eacute;s, the movie was pumping for a "raging" or "epic" party, but was shut down by one kid's mistakes, so the "graduating" kids simply drive around for the rest of the film, destroying anything or anyone in their path. Okay, fine, they do make it to one minor field party, but that was about one-one-thousandths of the "Woodstock" I'm sure it was trying to imitate. Going back to my original take on this, prior to my first (and only) viewing of Dazed and Confused, I thought Matthew McConaughey was supposed to be in this. Well, he was. Kind of. You just have to wait until half the movie was over and even then, he's such an extremely minor backdrop, he barely matters. In fact, no one really matters here. The film just follows these uninteresting teens through the course of one night of debauchery. Booooooring. If this really happened to me, and I was their age in 1976 (I had just turned two at the time), I would say the same thing then: This is boring. And apparently, I'm not alone: these characters feel the same way. Maybe, that was the point. Maybe they just wanted to show us the average night of no-nothings with no futures. Fine. If that's the point, I'll just watch You-Tube. To fans of this movie, please send me a note to explain what I am missing. I think I pretty much summed it up by saying this was about nothing. At least when Seinfeld made a career of that, he made it funny.

    Dazed & Confused is my favourite film of all time. I have no idea how many times I've seen it, but every watch is as enjoyable as the last. I was born five months after the seventies finished, in the UK. So as far as the social realism of the movie goes, I cannot comment. However in a very broad sense there are two things which make me love this film so very much. Firstly, it's just so damn cool. The cars look amazing, the soundtrack is great, the clothes are effortlessly hip and the male and female leads (or as close is this film gets to leads) are the two people you would have loved to know at High School, regardless of the social circle you were in. It is incredibly quotable and although not obviously funny (it was poorly marketed as a comedy), these days different scenes crack me up every time I watch it. It is also NOT a stoner flick. Yes there's a fair bit of pot smoked in it, but only because there was a fair bit of pot smoked at that time. Not a single scene has pot smoking as its focus  it's just there, like the music, the clothes or the high school football stadium. Secondly and more importantly, it is a far more subtle and realistic examination of high school life than just about anything else I've seen (The Last Picture Show comes close in its depiction during the 1950s). Yes there are "jocks", "cheerleaders" and "geeks", but they are not so rigid in their definition. They are all interlinked by people who have friends in many camps. They all have their flaws but like the vast majority of teenagers, almost all of them are generally good kids (bar one whose redeeming scene was cut). Even though it's the last day of school, Linklater doesn't focus on the obvious graduating seniors. Rather on next year's seniors and next year's freshmen. This is not a huge day in their lives and nothing life changing is going to happen. The year's big party gets busted before it even starts and they spend most of the night just driving around or at the local pool hall. Perhaps the most astounding thing is the sheer number of characters that RL fits in to the film. There is not one conversation which I would label as clich&eacute;d or forced to inform you of character, yet I have counted 22 main roles and by the end of the film you feel you really know all of them. I could go on to write an essay about why this film is so fine, but let me just finally say this. There's no defined plot, there's no first, second and third act as such and there are certainly no great resolutions (because how many resolutions to life's problems do you really encounter when you're a teenager?). However there are cool conversations, fun times, obstructive parents and awesome Foosball!!

Even today, the film holds up really well and makes for a non-stop entertaining picture. The film takes place in the 1970's over the course of one day, the last day of school. Seniors have now officially finished and they are looking for new freshman to 'initiate' which they usually do by means of bullying. Its something that would not fly today but very easily could have been tradition in the past. Where the film strives in its realism is in what these kids do on this last day of school, they party. And a filmmaker like Linklater is perfect for this because of his gift to let characters just walk in and out of the frame and follow a collective group instead of just a few characters. He doesn't just make a few characters stand out, he gives the whole school character. The film stars some actors that are a lot more well known currently than when this film was released, such as Ben Affleck, Matthew McConaughey, so on and so forth. The entire cast turns in serviceable performances and it makes for one of the more entertaining ensembles to come out of the 90s. With a cast as large as this, it could be easy to make the film too clouded and unfocused, but this is one of Linklater's specialties. He captures an important human connection on film that resonates with us viewers and its part of the large voice he has in American independent cinema. Linklater appropriately uses music in this film. He chooses songs that we're all familiar with and plays them amongst parts where they're most appropriate; such as playing School's Out by Alice Cooper when school is actually out. Its obvious but fitting since these songs were huge during this time period and it accurately captures the feel of that era. Here we aren't exposed to over-the-top 70's clothing and disco-influenced culture, but we get familiarized with a setting where we could easily see our parents growing up in. The film thrives with realism. This may be Linklater's most mainstream-appealing independent feature as a director. Slacker could be pretty divisive, its lack of plot could throw off a lot of viewers. Dazed and Confused also doesn't have much of a plot but this film appeals to a large group of people because of how well Linklater captured a familiar experience onto film to which we can all relate to. It makes for one of the most enjoyable films to come from the 90's and stands out as one of the director's most accomplished features.

    I went to high school in the early 70s. D&C does capture some of the fun of that era before AIDS, 9-11, Homeland Security, locker searches or much of the junk we put up with in 2013. In the Northeast we never had Freshman hazing, so I found that stuff a bit hard to relate to. I read here that was common in Texas high schools. I would recommend D&C not as great filmmaking but simply a fun look back at high school in a unique time that only lasted a few years. For young people that want to get a feel for the 70s, watch this film. Also see Fast Times at Ridgemont High and the first two seasons of That 70s Show. Freaking awesome, dude!

    That's the thing about movies, man, no matter how many times I watch them they stay the exact same. Alright, alright, alright, it's the beginning of summer for me so that can only mean one thing. I watched Dazed and Confused. The year is 1976 and it is the first day of summer. Seniors abuse freshman and then go party. This is the story of one wild and crazy night from many different perspectives. This was a classic and it is timeless. There is everything in this movie from stoners to nerds to jocks to normal people. You get a sense of what high school was like back in the day. The main characters are Pink, the senior quarterback, and Mitch the upcoming freshman. There a lot of other lovable characters like the creepy Matthew McConaughey , the big bully Ben Affleck, and everything in-between. Pink is pressured from coaches to sign a waiver for next year's season and he doesn't know what he wants to do. This is a subtle problem that carries throughout the entire movie, which adds a spice to the movie. Mitch struggles with the annual beating from the seniors but soon comes to his own and finds out what high school is all about. The high school atmosphere in the 70s was incredible, I almost wish I was 18 back then. The stuff these kids got away with. The way they acted in school on the last day with the smoking weed outside and throwing papers everywhere. The group of guys is driving and take trash barrels and destroy mail boxes. Something like that would never happen today. The most disturbing scene was the hazing of the freshman girls. They poured ketchup and mustard on them and made them all gross. Hazing is a terrible thing but at least the movie made it funny. It is weird how they can abuse them one second and then a few hours later they are parrying with the girls they abused. The 70s was a weird decade. The 70s was a messed up decade but it did have killer music. Every scene had a perfect editing of music. Everything from Zeppelin to Ozzy to Kansas. The school bell rings and Alice Cooper's Schools Out blares and it was picture perfect. Music makes a movie, I say it all the time, music makes the movie, and the music made this movie. There was no original score, which is a little strange, but I knew every song they played and I love that kind of music so it made me very happy. My favorite character was the biggest stoner I have ever seen on the big screen. I forget his name but he has the long hair and the backwards cap and he is high in very scene. He speaks complete nonsense about the founding fathers and the cosmos and it is hilarious. It is between him and the Jewish guy from Saving Private Ryan. He plays a nerd who rambles on and on. Sometimes he makes sense and sometimes you just want him to shut up. His character has a lot of development and his group of friends is entertaining. So let's break this movie down. The plot is fantastic, the scenes themselves are well put together and there is really no boring part. There are a lot of characters so it can be a little difficult to follow but all are unique and mesh together perfectly. The acting wasn't remarkable but for the purpose of the movie it worked. The movie isn't really about the story or the deep emotions of the characters. It is strictly about the crazy antics of high school seniors. It is a night we all wish we could have. There are a few reality checks and unbelievable moments but overall a lot of fun. There isn't really much more that can be said about this movie other than it is a movie you need to see if you haven't. Overall, Dazed and Confused is timeless fun that can be enjoyed by anyone. It shows the ease of summer and in a way defined a decade. The music was great, the story was good enough, the acting was fine, it was funny, touching, and a lot of fun. I love this movie and I can see it anywhere, anytime. This is a great movie to see with friends, it is probably better with friends and is also a good background movie at party of something. I suggest you don't look into this movie too much but rather enjoy it for what it is, mindless fun. Dazed and Confused gets the WillyT Honorable Mention., so go watch it and enjoy and remember the days of drinking as a kid.

    There's really no story but it's not necessary for this flick; it's more of a hang-out movie. The movie brings you to the last day of school and summer is just around the corner. You get to see teens having fun, drinking beer and smoking pot. This is a time machine for everyone that was a teen in the 70's. The movie has a great soundtrack that I enjoyed to the fullest, especially when they end the movie with Slater sitting in the backseat of a Chevelle blowing out marijuana smoke while the Chevelle drives towards the horizon with Foghat's Slow Ride playing in the background. It's a really cool movie and I think every teen should watch it at least once in their lifetime. I give it a 10 because it's a great movie and I can relate so much to it.

    After watching Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise, Sunset I was moved and looked up his other movies and this title caught my attention. I got it and saw it recently. The plot is one which we all can connect with, which is the last day of school (probably not the part where all the drinking and smoking, getting wasted, laid happens). The craziness, rawness, carelessness of youth at that point of time is displayed on screen with much clarity. The dialogs are well written. The characters are all unique and have all performed well. We can connect to each of the character in the movie. Some are nerds, discussing deep, philosophical matters, theories, etc, who are decent and less violent as compared to the other groups. Some are violent, rash, rude and have all those character traits of a person, our parents warn us to stay away from. They make a joke of authority, care least about their own future and get involved in drugs, smoking, drinking etc. There's a line by a character in the movie which goes something on the lines of "if life's so short then we should enjoy it to the maximum while we are alive". Some kids take it too seriously and ruin their lives. I almost felt like talking to these kids and telling them its not the way of life, and that they are wasting their lives' best days. But then they would scoff at any such idea which stops them from enjoying. Some parts are very funny. Whenever Slater comes on screen, its hilarious. And there are parts where we can see how vulnerable some of the characters are to find someone to fall in love with. There is some great sound tracks running in the background which sets the mood for the 70's. Some great dialogs too. There is no conclusion shown but that bitter-sweet period is captured brilliantly. I rate it 7/10.

    All I knew about this film was that it was a pot smoking, 1970's-set film starring Matthew McConaughey. After finally seeing the nearly 20-year old film, I was virtually left Dazed and Confused on the only other "fact" I knew about it: this was supposed to be a comedy. This movie NEVER made me laugh. I will admit it did have me snickering a few times, namely a pregnant woman who was simultaneously smoking and being lectured on the healthy habits of calcium and another girl getting her tight jean's zipper up with pliers. Other than that, I found absolutely nothing funny about the lame story of horny and disorderly punks leaving their junior year of high school and entering summer, all in one night. Allow me to back track, I'm guessing some of this is about Juniors in High School, and some about Seniors. My suspicion was that this was SUPPOSED to be about seniors, as some of the graffiti and Junior High Abuse indicated, but the majority were being coached on their final year in High School and their football careers. So, I guess this was about all ages  Junior High to Freshmen to Juniors in High School to Seniors to Already Graduated Losers. Was that the intention of the writers? Not sure, but I am sure, I only saw this as a drama about a bunch of unruly, irresponsible adolescences who spend one night in May drinking, pot-smoking, complaining and destroying lives and property for the sole purpose ofnothing. So much so, there was a great quote two-thirds in and I love it when a character sums up the movie in the dialogue: "Fairly uneventful, huh?" Yep, that defines the movie. Heck, despite the clich&eacute;s, the movie was pumping for a "raging" or "epic" party, but was shut down by one kid's mistakes, so the "graduating" kids simply drive around for the rest of the film, destroying anything or anyone in their path. Okay, fine, they do make it to one minor field party, but that was about one-one-thousandths of the "Woodstock" I'm sure it was trying to imitate. Going back to my original take on this, prior to my first (and only) viewing of Dazed and Confused, I thought Matthew McConaughey was supposed to be in this. Well, he was. Kind of. You just have to wait until half the movie was over and even then, he's such an extremely minor backdrop, he barely matters. In fact, no one really matters here. The film just follows these uninteresting teens through the course of one night of debauchery. Booooooring. If this really happened to me, and I was their age in 1976 (I had just turned two at the time), I would say the same thing then: This is boring. And apparently, I'm not alone: these characters feel the same way. Maybe, that was the point. Maybe they just wanted to show us the average night of no-nothings with no futures. Fine. If that's the point, I'll just watch You-Tube. To fans of this movie, please send me a note to explain what I am missing. I think I pretty much summed it up by saying this was about nothing. At least when Seinfeld made a career of that, he made it funny.

    Dazed & Confused is my favourite film of all time. I have no idea how many times I've seen it, but every watch is as enjoyable as the last. I was born five months after the seventies finished, in the UK. So as far as the social realism of the movie goes, I cannot comment. However in a very broad sense there are two things which make me love this film so very much. Firstly, it's just so damn cool. The cars look amazing, the soundtrack is great, the clothes are effortlessly hip and the male and female leads (or as close is this film gets to leads) are the two people you would have loved to know at High School, regardless of the social circle you were in. It is incredibly quotable and although not obviously funny (it was poorly marketed as a comedy), these days different scenes crack me up every time I watch it. It is also NOT a stoner flick. Yes there's a fair bit of pot smoked in it, but only because there was a fair bit of pot smoked at that time. Not a single scene has pot smoking as its focus  it's just there, like the music, the clothes or the high school football stadium. Secondly and more importantly, it is a far more subtle and realistic examination of high school life than just about anything else I've seen (The Last Picture Show comes close in its depiction during the 1950s). Yes there are "jocks", "cheerleaders" and "geeks", but they are not so rigid in their definition. They are all interlinked by people who have friends in many camps. They all have their flaws but like the vast majority of teenagers, almost all of them are generally good kids (bar one whose redeeming scene was cut). Even though it's the last day of school, Linklater doesn't focus on the obvious graduating seniors. Rather on next year's seniors and next year's freshmen. This is not a huge day in their lives and nothing life changing is going to happen. The year's big party gets busted before it even starts and they spend most of the night just driving around or at the local pool hall. Perhaps the most astounding thing is the sheer number of characters that RL fits in to the film. There is not one conversation which I would label as clich&eacute;d or forced to inform you of character, yet I have counted 22 main roles and by the end of the film you feel you really know all of them. I could go on to write an essay about why this film is so fine, but let me just finally say this. There's no defined plot, there's no first, second and third act as such and there are certainly no great resolutions (because how many resolutions to life's problems do you really encounter when you're a teenager?). However there are cool conversations, fun times, obstructive parents and awesome Foosball!!

    My mother gave me this movie on DVD as a present, since I love stoner comedies. This had potential, it had an all-star cast, a reputable director, and a catchy title. The first twelve minutes were promising, high school is almost over and the story seemed to be going in a positive direction. After those precious twelve minutes, this movie went completely downhill. There was no plot whatsoever, zero conflict, and undeveloped characters, things you do not want in a classic film. I was disappointed and I had never been so bored in my life watching a "comedy" that felt like an eternity to finish. There is only ONE funny scene worth watching and that's the part where the hippie talks about George Washington smoking weed. Other than that, I cannot believe this project got made in the first place. It doesn't even count as a real movie, but I digress! If you want to watch an overrated movie that is boring and has no redeeming qualities to it, then this is the movie for you. I'm glad I shared my opinion and by the way, I sold the DVD after watching this piece of garbage for the third time.

    Loved this movie when it came out, but with each successive viewing it seems smaller and less than its first impression. Undeniably, the Criterion package is beautiful (the booklet worth the price alone), but I'm surprised that they chose to put this film out at all. The nighttime cinematography is a serious thing of beauty, the performances are mostly good to brilliant, the music plumbs the depths of 70's trash rock with curatorial zeal. Still somehow, the finished product cruises about midway between the offhand brilliance of American Graffiti and the adolescent goofs of Porky's. Watching the deleted scenes, I think it may be that the movie just isn't long enough. What did they leave out? The girls, of course. With the bulk of screen time spent with the male characters - hazing and being hazed, the hardships of being a jock AND a freak, drink and drug rants. Why no room for the other, equally looped perspective which was actually filmed? Kaye's ongoing rants about sexism and politics followed by Shavonne's mockery were unnecessarily, ridiculously sacrificed (the actresses must have been livid when they saw they finished product). Why - for the sake of a tidy run time? It's a shame, and the final edit mimics Lucas's AG so precisely in neglecting the actresses (seldom on screen unless they're relating to a male character) that it almost seems programmatic (read: studio mandate - girls are boring). Maybe it wasn't outside interference, but I have some hope that Linklater will someday sit down and eek out a longer cut. And while he's at it replace that last throw away shot through the windshield. What the heck is that? Looks like Slater grabbed the camera, for chrissakes. By the way, the reviewer who said the depiction was Not Realistic At All - he graduated in 73 and clearly missed all that shortly followed. The mid-seventies were a hybridizing period. Every guy but the scuzziest badass had a slick nylon button up shirt, even people who hated disco. Hippie style was subverted/perverted by consumer culture, the natural look gone cartoon tawdry. The worst thing you could do in 1976 was try too hard (see if you can sell that to today's crop of attention seekers). Everyone looked ridiculous, but mellow ridiculous. No, the look and styling of this film is pretty spot-on, though everyone is too clean and the girl's makeup is way too flattering (mascara in the seventies was so globby it looked like spiders died on your eyes). Also, the main character's ride between the two social camps was one of the subtle touches that really made the movie work for me. Stoners were called freaks, and jocks who did drugs were frocks. There were plenty at my suburban nowhere school - one of them was a homecoming attendant and a well known (to the students) user. It made him popular with everyone, not unlike Randy Floyd. Sorry man - you checked out a little too early to authenticate this party buzz.

    Not sure where to begin with this movie. I first saw it at around 1am with my older brother around 2001 and as soon as the end credits rolled we watched it all over again. I've now seen Dazed and Confused over 30 times and it never fails to entertain me. Entertain is the wrong word. The best word that describes this movie (for me anyway) is 'feeling'. Its a feeling. I wasn't even born until the early 80s but there's something about this movie that just captures my childhood. Probably that summer feeling. Again that word pops up. The characters, soundtrack, setting. Its just perfect. Everything i never knew i wanted in a film all lining up to capture a feeling i never want to forget. Whether i experienced the same as the characters or not i just can't help but watch this movie over and over again. Whether it be in the background while i'm procrastinating or i if i just want to 'feel'. Again these words don't really begin to sum up my true feelings about this movie. I just can't explain it. Its a special film and no other film will probably ever make me feel this way ever again.

The movie has a great soundtrack that I enjoyed to the fullest, especially when they end the movie with Slater sitting in the backseat of a Chevelle blowing out marijuana smoke while the Chevelle drives towards the horizon with Foghat's Slow Ride playing in the background. It's a really cool movie and I think every teen should watch it at least once in their lifetime. I give it a 10 because it's a great movie and I can relate so much to it.

    After watching Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise, Sunset I was moved and looked up his other movies and this title caught my attention. I got it and saw it recently. The plot is one which we all can connect with, which is the last day of school (probably not the part where all the drinking and smoking, getting wasted, laid happens). The craziness, rawness, carelessness of youth at that point of time is displayed on screen with much clarity. The dialogs are well written. The characters are all unique and have all performed well. We can connect to each of the character in the movie. Some are nerds, discussing deep, philosophical matters, theories, etc, who are decent and less violent as compared to the other groups. Some are violent, rash, rude and have all those character traits of a person, our parents warn us to stay away from. They make a joke of authority, care least about their own future and get involved in drugs, smoking, drinking etc. There's a line by a character in the movie which goes something on the lines of "if life's so short then we should enjoy it to the maximum while we are alive". Some kids take it too seriously and ruin their lives. I almost felt like talking to these kids and telling them its not the way of life, and that they are wasting their lives' best days. But then they would scoff at any such idea which stops them from enjoying. Some parts are very funny. Whenever Slater comes on screen, its hilarious. And there are parts where we can see how vulnerable some of the characters are to find someone to fall in love with. There is some great sound tracks running in the background which sets the mood for the 70's. Some great dialogs too. There is no conclusion shown but that bitter-sweet period is captured brilliantly. I rate it 7/10.

    All I knew about this film was that it was a pot smoking, 1970's-set film starring Matthew McConaughey. After finally seeing the nearly 20-year old film, I was virtually left Dazed and Confused on the only other "fact" I knew about it: this was supposed to be a comedy. This movie NEVER made me laugh. I will admit it did have me snickering a few times, namely a pregnant woman who was simultaneously smoking and being lectured on the healthy habits of calcium and another girl getting her tight jean's zipper up with pliers. Other than that, I found absolutely nothing funny about the lame story of horny and disorderly punks leaving their junior year of high school and entering summer, all in one night. Allow me to back track, I'm guessing some of this is about Juniors in High School, and some about Seniors. My suspicion was that this was SUPPOSED to be about seniors, as some of the graffiti and Junior High Abuse indicated, but the majority were being coached on their final year in High School and their football careers. So, I guess this was about all ages  Junior High to Freshmen to Juniors in High School to Seniors to Already Graduated Losers. Was that the intention of the writers? Not sure, but I am sure, I only saw this as a drama about a bunch of unruly, irresponsible adolescences who spend one night in May drinking, pot-smoking, complaining and destroying lives and property for the sole purpose ofnothing. So much so, there was a great quote two-thirds in and I love it when a character sums up the movie in the dialogue: "Fairly uneventful, huh?" Yep, that defines the movie. Heck, despite the clich&eacute;s, the movie was pumping for a "raging" or "epic" party, but was shut down by one kid's mistakes, so the "graduating" kids simply drive around for the rest of the film, destroying anything or anyone in their path. Okay, fine, they do make it to one minor field party, but that was about one-one-thousandths of the "Woodstock" I'm sure it was trying to imitate. Going back to my original take on this, prior to my first (and only) viewing of Dazed and Confused, I thought Matthew McConaughey was supposed to be in this. Well, he was. Kind of. You just have to wait until half the movie was over and even then, he's such an extremely minor backdrop, he barely matters. In fact, no one really matters here. The film just follows these uninteresting teens through the course of one night of debauchery. Booooooring. If this really happened to me, and I was their age in 1976 (I had just turned two at the time), I would say the same thing then: This is boring. And apparently, I'm not alone: these characters feel the same way. Maybe, that was the point. Maybe they just wanted to show us the average night of no-nothings with no futures. Fine. If that's the point, I'll just watch You-Tube. To fans of this movie, please send me a note to explain what I am missing. I think I pretty much summed it up by saying this was about nothing. At least when Seinfeld made a career of that, he made it funny.

    Dazed & Confused is my favourite film of all time. I have no idea how many times I've seen it, but every watch is as enjoyable as the last. I was born five months after the seventies finished, in the UK. So as far as the social realism of the movie goes, I cannot comment. However in a very broad sense there are two things which make me love this film so very much. Firstly, it's just so damn cool. The cars look amazing, the soundtrack is great, the clothes are effortlessly hip and the male and female leads (or as close is this film gets to leads) are the two people you would have loved to know at High School, regardless of the social circle you were in. It is incredibly quotable and although not obviously funny (it was poorly marketed as a comedy), these days different scenes crack me up every time I watch it. It is also NOT a stoner flick. Yes there's a fair bit of pot smoked in it, but only because there was a fair bit of pot smoked at that time. Not a single scene has pot smoking as its focus  it's just there, like the music, the clothes or the high school football stadium. Secondly and more importantly, it is a far more subtle and realistic examination of high school life than just about anything else I've seen (The Last Picture Show comes close in its depiction during the 1950s). Yes there are "jocks", "cheerleaders" and "geeks", but they are not so rigid in their definition. They are all interlinked by people who have friends in many camps. They all have their flaws but like the vast majority of teenagers, almost all of them are generally good kids (bar one whose redeeming scene was cut). Even though it's the last day of school, Linklater doesn't focus on the obvious graduating seniors. Rather on next year's seniors and next year's freshmen. This is not a huge day in their lives and nothing life changing is going to happen. The year's big party gets busted before it even starts and they spend most of the night just driving around or at the local pool hall. Perhaps the most astounding thing is the sheer number of characters that RL fits in to the film. There is not one conversation which I would label as clich&eacute;d or forced to inform you of character, yet I have counted 22 main roles and by the end of the film you feel you really know all of them. I could go on to write an essay about why this film is so fine, but let me just finally say this. There's no defined plot, there's no first, second and third act as such and there are certainly no great resolutions (because how many resolutions to life's problems do you really encounter when you're a teenager?). However there are cool conversations, fun times, obstructive parents and awesome Foosball!!

    My mother gave me this movie on DVD as a present, since I love stoner comedies. This had potential, it had an all-star cast, a reputable director, and a catchy title. The first twelve minutes were promising, high school is almost over and the story seemed to be going in a positive direction. After those precious twelve minutes, this movie went completely downhill. There was no plot whatsoever, zero conflict, and undeveloped characters, things you do not want in a classic film. I was disappointed and I had never been so bored in my life watching a "comedy" that felt like an eternity to finish. There is only ONE funny scene worth watching and that's the part where the hippie talks about George Washington smoking weed. Other than that, I cannot believe this project got made in the first place. It doesn't even count as a real movie, but I digress! If you want to watch an overrated movie that is boring and has no redeeming qualities to it, then this is the movie for you. I'm glad I shared my opinion and by the way, I sold the DVD after watching this piece of garbage for the third time.

    Loved this movie when it came out, but with each successive viewing it seems smaller and less than its first impression. Undeniably, the Criterion package is beautiful (the booklet worth the price alone), but I'm surprised that they chose to put this film out at all. The nighttime cinematography is a serious thing of beauty, the performances are mostly good to brilliant, the music plumbs the depths of 70's trash rock with curatorial zeal. Still somehow, the finished product cruises about midway between the offhand brilliance of American Graffiti and the adolescent goofs of Porky's. Watching the deleted scenes, I think it may be that the movie just isn't long enough. What did they leave out? The girls, of course. With the bulk of screen time spent with the male characters - hazing and being hazed, the hardships of being a jock AND a freak, drink and drug rants. Why no room for the other, equally looped perspective which was actually filmed? Kaye's ongoing rants about sexism and politics followed by Shavonne's mockery were unnecessarily, ridiculously sacrificed (the actresses must have been livid when they saw they finished product). Why - for the sake of a tidy run time? It's a shame, and the final edit mimics Lucas's AG so precisely in neglecting the actresses (seldom on screen unless they're relating to a male character) that it almost seems programmatic (read: studio mandate - girls are boring). Maybe it wasn't outside interference, but I have some hope that Linklater will someday sit down and eek out a longer cut. And while he's at it replace that last throw away shot through the windshield. What the heck is that? Looks like Slater grabbed the camera, for chrissakes. By the way, the reviewer who said the depiction was Not Realistic At All - he graduated in 73 and clearly missed all that shortly followed. The mid-seventies were a hybridizing period. Every guy but the scuzziest badass had a slick nylon button up shirt, even people who hated disco. Hippie style was subverted/perverted by consumer culture, the natural look gone cartoon tawdry. The worst thing you could do in 1976 was try too hard (see if you can sell that to today's crop of attention seekers). Everyone looked ridiculous, but mellow ridiculous. No, the look and styling of this film is pretty spot-on, though everyone is too clean and the girl's makeup is way too flattering (mascara in the seventies was so globby it looked like spiders died on your eyes). Also, the main character's ride between the two social camps was one of the subtle touches that really made the movie work for me. Stoners were called freaks, and jocks who did drugs were frocks. There were plenty at my suburban nowhere school - one of them was a homecoming attendant and a well known (to the students) user. It made him popular with everyone, not unlike Randy Floyd. Sorry man - you checked out a little too early to authenticate this party buzz.

    Not sure where to begin with this movie. I first saw it at around 1am with my older brother around 2001 and as soon as the end credits rolled we watched it all over again. I've now seen Dazed and Confused over 30 times and it never fails to entertain me. Entertain is the wrong word. The best word that describes this movie (for me anyway) is 'feeling'. Its a feeling. I wasn't even born until the early 80s but there's something about this movie that just captures my childhood. Probably that summer feeling. Again that word pops up. The characters, soundtrack, setting. Its just perfect. Everything i never knew i wanted in a film all lining up to capture a feeling i never want to forget. Whether i experienced the same as the characters or not i just can't help but watch this movie over and over again. Whether it be in the background while i'm procrastinating or i if i just want to 'feel'. Again these words don't really begin to sum up my true feelings about this movie. I just can't explain it. Its a special film and no other film will probably ever make me feel this way ever again.

    Often referred to as a cult classic, Dazed and Confused lives up to its name in every way. After his excellent directorial debut, Richard Linklater, who was considered an important up-and-coming director hit every right note in his second feature, cementing his status as one of America's most exciting filmmakers. Even today, the film holds up really well and makes for a non-stop entertaining picture. The film takes place in the 1970's over the course of one day, the last day of school. Seniors have now officially finished and they are looking for new freshman to 'initiate' which they usually do by means of bullying. Its something that would not fly today but very easily could have been tradition in the past. Where the film strives in its realism is in what these kids do on this last day of school, they party. And a filmmaker like Linklater is perfect for this because of his gift to let characters just walk in and out of the frame and follow a collective group instead of just a few characters. He doesn't just make a few characters stand out, he gives the whole school character. The film stars some actors that are a lot more well known currently than when this film was released, such as Ben Affleck, Matthew McConaughey, so on and so forth. The entire cast turns in serviceable performances and it makes for one of the more entertaining ensembles to come out of the 90s. With a cast as large as this, it could be easy to make the film too clouded and unfocused, but this is one of Linklater's specialties. He captures an important human connection on film that resonates with us viewers and its part of the large voice he has in American independent cinema. Linklater appropriately uses music in this film. He chooses songs that we're all familiar with and plays them amongst parts where they're most appropriate; such as playing School's Out by Alice Cooper when school is actually out. Its obvious but fitting since these songs were huge during this time period and it accurately captures the feel of that era. Here we aren't exposed to over-the-top 70's clothing and disco-influenced culture, but we get familiarized with a setting where we could easily see our parents growing up in. The film thrives with realism. This may be Linklater's most mainstream-appealing independent feature as a director. Slacker could be pretty divisive, its lack of plot could throw off a lot of viewers. Dazed and Confused also doesn't have much of a plot but this film appeals to a large group of people because of how well Linklater captured a familiar experience onto film to which we can all relate to. It makes for one of the most enjoyable films to come from the 90's and stands out as one of the director's most accomplished features.

    I went to high school in the early 70s. D&C does capture some of the fun of that era before AIDS, 9-11, Homeland Security, locker searches or much of the junk we put up with in 2013. In the Northeast we never had Freshman hazing, so I found that stuff a bit hard to relate to. I read here that was common in Texas high schools. I would recommend D&C not as great filmmaking but simply a fun look back at high school in a unique time that only lasted a few years. For young people that want to get a feel for the 70s, watch this film. Also see Fast Times at Ridgemont High and the first two seasons of That 70s Show. Freaking awesome, dude!

    That's the thing about movies, man, no matter how many times I watch them they stay the exact same. Alright, alright, alright, it's the beginning of summer for me so that can only mean one thing. I watched Dazed and Confused. The year is 1976 and it is the first day of summer. Seniors abuse freshman and then go party. This is the story of one wild and crazy night from many different perspectives. This was a classic and it is timeless. There is everything in this movie from stoners to nerds to jocks to normal people. You get a sense of what high school was like back in the day. The main characters are Pink, the senior quarterback, and Mitch the upcoming freshman. There a lot of other lovable characters like the creepy Matthew McConaughey , the big bully Ben Affleck, and everything in-between. Pink is pressured from coaches to sign a waiver for next year's season and he doesn't know what he wants to do. This is a subtle problem that carries throughout the entire movie, which adds a spice to the movie. Mitch struggles with the annual beating from the seniors but soon comes to his own and finds out what high school is all about. The high school atmosphere in the 70s was incredible, I almost wish I was 18 back then. The stuff these kids got away with. The way they acted in school on the last day with the smoking weed outside and throwing papers everywhere. The group of guys is driving and take trash barrels and destroy mail boxes. Something like that would never happen today. The most disturbing scene was the hazing of the freshman girls. They poured ketchup and mustard on them and made them all gross. Hazing is a terrible thing but at least the movie made it funny. It is weird how they can abuse them one second and then a few hours later they are parrying with the girls they abused. The 70s was a weird decade. The 70s was a messed up decade but it did have killer music. Every scene had a perfect editing of music. Everything from Zeppelin to Ozzy to Kansas. The school bell rings and Alice Cooper's Schools Out blares and it was picture perfect. Music makes a movie, I say it all the time, music makes the movie, and the music made this movie. There was no original score, which is a little strange, but I knew every song they played and I love that kind of music so it made me very happy. My favorite character was the biggest stoner I have ever seen on the big screen. I forget his name but he has the long hair and the backwards cap and he is high in very scene. He speaks complete nonsense about the founding fathers and the cosmos and it is hilarious. It is between him and the Jewish guy from Saving Private Ryan. He plays a nerd who rambles on and on. Sometimes he makes sense and sometimes you just want him to shut up. His character has a lot of development and his group of friends is entertaining. So let's break this movie down. The plot is fantastic, the scenes themselves are well put together and there is really no boring part. There are a lot of characters so it can be a little difficult to follow but all are unique and mesh together perfectly. The acting wasn't remarkable but for the purpose of the movie it worked. The movie isn't really about the story or the deep emotions of the characters. It is strictly about the crazy antics of high school seniors. It is a night we all wish we could have. There are a few reality checks and unbelievable moments but overall a lot of fun. There isn't really much more that can be said about this movie other than it is a movie you need to see if you haven't. Overall, Dazed and Confused is timeless fun that can be enjoyed by anyone. It shows the ease of summer and in a way defined a decade. The music was great, the story was good enough, the acting was fine, it was funny, touching, and a lot of fun. I love this movie and I can see it anywhere, anytime. This is a great movie to see with friends, it is probably better with friends and is also a good background movie at party of something. I suggest you don't look into this movie too much but rather enjoy it for what it is, mindless fun. Dazed and Confused gets the WillyT Honorable Mention., so go watch it and enjoy and remember the days of drinking as a kid.

There is not one conversation which I would label as clich&eacute;d or forced to inform you of character, yet I have counted 22 main roles and by the end of the film you feel you really know all of them. I could go on to write an essay about why this film is so fine, but let me just finally say this. There's no defined plot, there's no first, second and third act as such and there are certainly no great resolutions (because how many resolutions to life's problems do you really encounter when you're a teenager?). However there are cool conversations, fun times, obstructive parents and awesome Foosball!!

    My mother gave me this movie on DVD as a present, since I love stoner comedies. This had potential, it had an all-star cast, a reputable director, and a catchy title. The first twelve minutes were promising, high school is almost over and the story seemed to be going in a positive direction. After those precious twelve minutes, this movie went completely downhill. There was no plot whatsoever, zero conflict, and undeveloped characters, things you do not want in a classic film. I was disappointed and I had never been so bored in my life watching a "comedy" that felt like an eternity to finish. There is only ONE funny scene worth watching and that's the part where the hippie talks about George Washington smoking weed. Other than that, I cannot believe this project got made in the first place. It doesn't even count as a real movie, but I digress! If you want to watch an overrated movie that is boring and has no redeeming qualities to it, then this is the movie for you. I'm glad I shared my opinion and by the way, I sold the DVD after watching this piece of garbage for the third time.

    Loved this movie when it came out, but with each successive viewing it seems smaller and less than its first impression. Undeniably, the Criterion package is beautiful (the booklet worth the price alone), but I'm surprised that they chose to put this film out at all. The nighttime cinematography is a serious thing of beauty, the performances are mostly good to brilliant, the music plumbs the depths of 70's trash rock with curatorial zeal. Still somehow, the finished product cruises about midway between the offhand brilliance of American Graffiti and the adolescent goofs of Porky's. Watching the deleted scenes, I think it may be that the movie just isn't long enough. What did they leave out? The girls, of course. With the bulk of screen time spent with the male characters - hazing and being hazed, the hardships of being a jock AND a freak, drink and drug rants. Why no room for the other, equally looped perspective which was actually filmed? Kaye's ongoing rants about sexism and politics followed by Shavonne's mockery were unnecessarily, ridiculously sacrificed (the actresses must have been livid when they saw they finished product). Why - for the sake of a tidy run time? It's a shame, and the final edit mimics Lucas's AG so precisely in neglecting the actresses (seldom on screen unless they're relating to a male character) that it almost seems programmatic (read: studio mandate - girls are boring). Maybe it wasn't outside interference, but I have some hope that Linklater will someday sit down and eek out a longer cut. And while he's at it replace that last throw away shot through the windshield. What the heck is that? Looks like Slater grabbed the camera, for chrissakes. By the way, the reviewer who said the depiction was Not Realistic At All - he graduated in 73 and clearly missed all that shortly followed. The mid-seventies were a hybridizing period. Every guy but the scuzziest badass had a slick nylon button up shirt, even people who hated disco. Hippie style was subverted/perverted by consumer culture, the natural look gone cartoon tawdry. The worst thing you could do in 1976 was try too hard (see if you can sell that to today's crop of attention seekers). Everyone looked ridiculous, but mellow ridiculous. No, the look and styling of this film is pretty spot-on, though everyone is too clean and the girl's makeup is way too flattering (mascara in the seventies was so globby it looked like spiders died on your eyes). Also, the main character's ride between the two social camps was one of the subtle touches that really made the movie work for me. Stoners were called freaks, and jocks who did drugs were frocks. There were plenty at my suburban nowhere school - one of them was a homecoming attendant and a well known (to the students) user. It made him popular with everyone, not unlike Randy Floyd. Sorry man - you checked out a little too early to authenticate this party buzz.

    Not sure where to begin with this movie. I first saw it at around 1am with my older brother around 2001 and as soon as the end credits rolled we watched it all over again. I've now seen Dazed and Confused over 30 times and it never fails to entertain me. Entertain is the wrong word. The best word that describes this movie (for me anyway) is 'feeling'. Its a feeling. I wasn't even born until the early 80s but there's something about this movie that just captures my childhood. Probably that summer feeling. Again that word pops up. The characters, soundtrack, setting. Its just perfect. Everything i never knew i wanted in a film all lining up to capture a feeling i never want to forget. Whether i experienced the same as the characters or not i just can't help but watch this movie over and over again. Whether it be in the background while i'm procrastinating or i if i just want to 'feel'. Again these words don't really begin to sum up my true feelings about this movie. I just can't explain it. Its a special film and no other film will probably ever make me feel this way ever again.

    Often referred to as a cult classic, Dazed and Confused lives up to its name in every way. After his excellent directorial debut, Richard Linklater, who was considered an important up-and-coming director hit every right note in his second feature, cementing his status as one of America's most exciting filmmakers. Even today, the film holds up really well and makes for a non-stop entertaining picture. The film takes place in the 1970's over the course of one day, the last day of school. Seniors have now officially finished and they are looking for new freshman to 'initiate' which they usually do by means of bullying. Its something that would not fly today but very easily could have been tradition in the past. Where the film strives in its realism is in what these kids do on this last day of school, they party. And a filmmaker like Linklater is perfect for this because of his gift to let characters just walk in and out of the frame and follow a collective group instead of just a few characters. He doesn't just make a few characters stand out, he gives the whole school character. The film stars some actors that are a lot more well known currently than when this film was released, such as Ben Affleck, Matthew McConaughey, so on and so forth. The entire cast turns in serviceable performances and it makes for one of the more entertaining ensembles to come out of the 90s. With a cast as large as this, it could be easy to make the film too clouded and unfocused, but this is one of Linklater's specialties. He captures an important human connection on film that resonates with us viewers and its part of the large voice he has in American independent cinema. Linklater appropriately uses music in this film. He chooses songs that we're all familiar with and plays them amongst parts where they're most appropriate; such as playing School's Out by Alice Cooper when school is actually out. Its obvious but fitting since these songs were huge during this time period and it accurately captures the feel of that era. Here we aren't exposed to over-the-top 70's clothing and disco-influenced culture, but we get familiarized with a setting where we could easily see our parents growing up in. The film thrives with realism. This may be Linklater's most mainstream-appealing independent feature as a director. Slacker could be pretty divisive, its lack of plot could throw off a lot of viewers. Dazed and Confused also doesn't have much of a plot but this film appeals to a large group of people because of how well Linklater captured a familiar experience onto film to which we can all relate to. It makes for one of the most enjoyable films to come from the 90's and stands out as one of the director's most accomplished features.

    I went to high school in the early 70s. D&C does capture some of the fun of that era before AIDS, 9-11, Homeland Security, locker searches or much of the junk we put up with in 2013. In the Northeast we never had Freshman hazing, so I found that stuff a bit hard to relate to. I read here that was common in Texas high schools. I would recommend D&C not as great filmmaking but simply a fun look back at high school in a unique time that only lasted a few years. For young people that want to get a feel for the 70s, watch this film. Also see Fast Times at Ridgemont High and the first two seasons of That 70s Show. Freaking awesome, dude!

    That's the thing about movies, man, no matter how many times I watch them they stay the exact same. Alright, alright, alright, it's the beginning of summer for me so that can only mean one thing. I watched Dazed and Confused. The year is 1976 and it is the first day of summer. Seniors abuse freshman and then go party. This is the story of one wild and crazy night from many different perspectives. This was a classic and it is timeless. There is everything in this movie from stoners to nerds to jocks to normal people. You get a sense of what high school was like back in the day. The main characters are Pink, the senior quarterback, and Mitch the upcoming freshman. There a lot of other lovable characters like the creepy Matthew McConaughey , the big bully Ben Affleck, and everything in-between. Pink is pressured from coaches to sign a waiver for next year's season and he doesn't know what he wants to do. This is a subtle problem that carries throughout the entire movie, which adds a spice to the movie. Mitch struggles with the annual beating from the seniors but soon comes to his own and finds out what high school is all about. The high school atmosphere in the 70s was incredible, I almost wish I was 18 back then. The stuff these kids got away with. The way they acted in school on the last day with the smoking weed outside and throwing papers everywhere. The group of guys is driving and take trash barrels and destroy mail boxes. Something like that would never happen today. The most disturbing scene was the hazing of the freshman girls. They poured ketchup and mustard on them and made them all gross. Hazing is a terrible thing but at least the movie made it funny. It is weird how they can abuse them one second and then a few hours later they are parrying with the girls they abused. The 70s was a weird decade. The 70s was a messed up decade but it did have killer music. Every scene had a perfect editing of music. Everything from Zeppelin to Ozzy to Kansas. The school bell rings and Alice Cooper's Schools Out blares and it was picture perfect. Music makes a movie, I say it all the time, music makes the movie, and the music made this movie. There was no original score, which is a little strange, but I knew every song they played and I love that kind of music so it made me very happy. My favorite character was the biggest stoner I have ever seen on the big screen. I forget his name but he has the long hair and the backwards cap and he is high in very scene. He speaks complete nonsense about the founding fathers and the cosmos and it is hilarious. It is between him and the Jewish guy from Saving Private Ryan. He plays a nerd who rambles on and on. Sometimes he makes sense and sometimes you just want him to shut up. His character has a lot of development and his group of friends is entertaining. So let's break this movie down. The plot is fantastic, the scenes themselves are well put together and there is really no boring part. There are a lot of characters so it can be a little difficult to follow but all are unique and mesh together perfectly. The acting wasn't remarkable but for the purpose of the movie it worked. The movie isn't really about the story or the deep emotions of the characters. It is strictly about the crazy antics of high school seniors. It is a night we all wish we could have. There are a few reality checks and unbelievable moments but overall a lot of fun. There isn't really much more that can be said about this movie other than it is a movie you need to see if you haven't. Overall, Dazed and Confused is timeless fun that can be enjoyed by anyone. It shows the ease of summer and in a way defined a decade. The music was great, the story was good enough, the acting was fine, it was funny, touching, and a lot of fun. I love this movie and I can see it anywhere, anytime. This is a great movie to see with friends, it is probably better with friends and is also a good background movie at party of something. I suggest you don't look into this movie too much but rather enjoy it for what it is, mindless fun. Dazed and Confused gets the WillyT Honorable Mention., so go watch it and enjoy and remember the days of drinking as a kid.

    There's really no story but it's not necessary for this flick; it's more of a hang-out movie. The movie brings you to the last day of school and summer is just around the corner. You get to see teens having fun, drinking beer and smoking pot. This is a time machine for everyone that was a teen in the 70's. The movie has a great soundtrack that I enjoyed to the fullest, especially when they end the movie with Slater sitting in the backseat of a Chevelle blowing out marijuana smoke while the Chevelle drives towards the horizon with Foghat's Slow Ride playing in the background. It's a really cool movie and I think every teen should watch it at least once in their lifetime. I give it a 10 because it's a great movie and I can relate so much to it.

    After watching Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise, Sunset I was moved and looked up his other movies and this title caught my attention. I got it and saw it recently. The plot is one which we all can connect with, which is the last day of school (probably not the part where all the drinking and smoking, getting wasted, laid happens). The craziness, rawness, carelessness of youth at that point of time is displayed on screen with much clarity. The dialogs are well written. The characters are all unique and have all performed well. We can connect to each of the character in the movie. Some are nerds, discussing deep, philosophical matters, theories, etc, who are decent and less violent as compared to the other groups. Some are violent, rash, rude and have all those character traits of a person, our parents warn us to stay away from. They make a joke of authority, care least about their own future and get involved in drugs, smoking, drinking etc. There's a line by a character in the movie which goes something on the lines of "if life's so short then we should enjoy it to the maximum while we are alive". Some kids take it too seriously and ruin their lives. I almost felt like talking to these kids and telling them its not the way of life, and that they are wasting their lives' best days. But then they would scoff at any such idea which stops them from enjoying. Some parts are very funny. Whenever Slater comes on screen, its hilarious. And there are parts where we can see how vulnerable some of the characters are to find someone to fall in love with. There is some great sound tracks running in the background which sets the mood for the 70's. Some great dialogs too. There is no conclusion shown but that bitter-sweet period is captured brilliantly. I rate it 7/10.

    All I knew about this film was that it was a pot smoking, 1970's-set film starring Matthew McConaughey. After finally seeing the nearly 20-year old film, I was virtually left Dazed and Confused on the only other "fact" I knew about it: this was supposed to be a comedy. This movie NEVER made me laugh. I will admit it did have me snickering a few times, namely a pregnant woman who was simultaneously smoking and being lectured on the healthy habits of calcium and another girl getting her tight jean's zipper up with pliers. Other than that, I found absolutely nothing funny about the lame story of horny and disorderly punks leaving their junior year of high school and entering summer, all in one night. Allow me to back track, I'm guessing some of this is about Juniors in High School, and some about Seniors. My suspicion was that this was SUPPOSED to be about seniors, as some of the graffiti and Junior High Abuse indicated, but the majority were being coached on their final year in High School and their football careers. So, I guess this was about all ages  Junior High to Freshmen to Juniors in High School to Seniors to Already Graduated Losers. Was that the intention of the writers? Not sure, but I am sure, I only saw this as a drama about a bunch of unruly, irresponsible adolescences who spend one night in May drinking, pot-smoking, complaining and destroying lives and property for the sole purpose ofnothing. So much so, there was a great quote two-thirds in and I love it when a character sums up the movie in the dialogue: "Fairly uneventful, huh?" Yep, that defines the movie. Heck, despite the clich&eacute;s, the movie was pumping for a "raging" or "epic" party, but was shut down by one kid's mistakes, so the "graduating" kids simply drive around for the rest of the film, destroying anything or anyone in their path. Okay, fine, they do make it to one minor field party, but that was about one-one-thousandths of the "Woodstock" I'm sure it was trying to imitate. Going back to my original take on this, prior to my first (and only) viewing of Dazed and Confused, I thought Matthew McConaughey was supposed to be in this. Well, he was. Kind of. You just have to wait until half the movie was over and even then, he's such an extremely minor backdrop, he barely matters. In fact, no one really matters here. The film just follows these uninteresting teens through the course of one night of debauchery. Booooooring. If this really happened to me, and I was their age in 1976 (I had just turned two at the time), I would say the same thing then: This is boring. And apparently, I'm not alone: these characters feel the same way. Maybe, that was the point. Maybe they just wanted to show us the average night of no-nothings with no futures. Fine. If that's the point, I'll just watch You-Tube. To fans of this movie, please send me a note to explain what I am missing. I think I pretty much summed it up by saying this was about nothing. At least when Seinfeld made a career of that, he made it funny.

    Dazed & Confused is my favourite film of all time. I have no idea how many times I've seen it, but every watch is as enjoyable as the last. I was born five months after the seventies finished, in the UK. So as far as the social realism of the movie goes, I cannot comment. However in a very broad sense there are two things which make me love this film so very much. Firstly, it's just so damn cool. The cars look amazing, the soundtrack is great, the clothes are effortlessly hip and the male and female leads (or as close is this film gets to leads) are the two people you would have loved to know at High School, regardless of the social circle you were in. It is incredibly quotable and although not obviously funny (it was poorly marketed as a comedy), these days different scenes crack me up every time I watch it. It is also NOT a stoner flick. Yes there's a fair bit of pot smoked in it, but only because there was a fair bit of pot smoked at that time. Not a single scene has pot smoking as its focus  it's just there, like the music, the clothes or the high school football stadium. Secondly and more importantly, it is a far more subtle and realistic examination of high school life than just about anything else I've seen (The Last Picture Show comes close in its depiction during the 1950s). Yes there are "jocks", "cheerleaders" and "geeks", but they are not so rigid in their definition. They are all interlinked by people who have friends in many camps. They all have their flaws but like the vast majority of teenagers, almost all of them are generally good kids (bar one whose redeeming scene was cut). Even though it's the last day of school, Linklater doesn't focus on the obvious graduating seniors. Rather on next year's seniors and next year's freshmen. This is not a huge day in their lives and nothing life changing is going to happen. The year's big party gets busted before it even starts and they spend most of the night just driving around or at the local pool hall. Perhaps the most astounding thing is the sheer number of characters that RL fits in to the film. There is not one conversation which I would label as clich&eacute;d or forced to inform you of character, yet I have counted 22 main roles and by the end of the film you feel you really know all of them. I could go on to write an essay about why this film is so fine, but let me just finally say this. There's no defined plot, there's no first, second and third act as such and there are certainly no great resolutions (because how many resolutions to life's problems do you really encounter when you're a teenager?). However there are cool conversations, fun times, obstructive parents and awesome Foosball!!

Linklater appropriately uses music in this film. He chooses songs that we're all familiar with and plays them amongst parts where they're most appropriate; such as playing School's Out by Alice Cooper when school is actually out. Its obvious but fitting since these songs were huge during this time period and it accurately captures the feel of that era. Here we aren't exposed to over-the-top 70's clothing and disco-influenced culture, but we get familiarized with a setting where we could easily see our parents growing up in. The film thrives with realism. This may be Linklater's most mainstream-appealing independent feature as a director. Slacker could be pretty divisive, its lack of plot could throw off a lot of viewers. Dazed and Confused also doesn't have much of a plot but this film appeals to a large group of people because of how well Linklater captured a familiar experience onto film to which we can all relate to. It makes for one of the most enjoyable films to come from the 90's and stands out as one of the director's most accomplished features.

    I went to high school in the early 70s. D&C does capture some of the fun of that era before AIDS, 9-11, Homeland Security, locker searches or much of the junk we put up with in 2013. In the Northeast we never had Freshman hazing, so I found that stuff a bit hard to relate to. I read here that was common in Texas high schools. I would recommend D&C not as great filmmaking but simply a fun look back at high school in a unique time that only lasted a few years. For young people that want to get a feel for the 70s, watch this film. Also see Fast Times at Ridgemont High and the first two seasons of That 70s Show. Freaking awesome, dude!

    That's the thing about movies, man, no matter how many times I watch them they stay the exact same. Alright, alright, alright, it's the beginning of summer for me so that can only mean one thing. I watched Dazed and Confused. The year is 1976 and it is the first day of summer. Seniors abuse freshman and then go party. This is the story of one wild and crazy night from many different perspectives. This was a classic and it is timeless. There is everything in this movie from stoners to nerds to jocks to normal people. You get a sense of what high school was like back in the day. The main characters are Pink, the senior quarterback, and Mitch the upcoming freshman. There a lot of other lovable characters like the creepy Matthew McConaughey , the big bully Ben Affleck, and everything in-between. Pink is pressured from coaches to sign a waiver for next year's season and he doesn't know what he wants to do. This is a subtle problem that carries throughout the entire movie, which adds a spice to the movie. Mitch struggles with the annual beating from the seniors but soon comes to his own and finds out what high school is all about. The high school atmosphere in the 70s was incredible, I almost wish I was 18 back then. The stuff these kids got away with. The way they acted in school on the last day with the smoking weed outside and throwing papers everywhere. The group of guys is driving and take trash barrels and destroy mail boxes. Something like that would never happen today. The most disturbing scene was the hazing of the freshman girls. They poured ketchup and mustard on them and made them all gross. Hazing is a terrible thing but at least the movie made it funny. It is weird how they can abuse them one second and then a few hours later they are parrying with the girls they abused. The 70s was a weird decade. The 70s was a messed up decade but it did have killer music. Every scene had a perfect editing of music. Everything from Zeppelin to Ozzy to Kansas. The school bell rings and Alice Cooper's Schools Out blares and it was picture perfect. Music makes a movie, I say it all the time, music makes the movie, and the music made this movie. There was no original score, which is a little strange, but I knew every song they played and I love that kind of music so it made me very happy. My favorite character was the biggest stoner I have ever seen on the big screen. I forget his name but he has the long hair and the backwards cap and he is high in very scene. He speaks complete nonsense about the founding fathers and the cosmos and it is hilarious. It is between him and the Jewish guy from Saving Private Ryan. He plays a nerd who rambles on and on. Sometimes he makes sense and sometimes you just want him to shut up. His character has a lot of development and his group of friends is entertaining. So let's break this movie down. The plot is fantastic, the scenes themselves are well put together and there is really no boring part. There are a lot of characters so it can be a little difficult to follow but all are unique and mesh together perfectly. The acting wasn't remarkable but for the purpose of the movie it worked. The movie isn't really about the story or the deep emotions of the characters. It is strictly about the crazy antics of high school seniors. It is a night we all wish we could have. There are a few reality checks and unbelievable moments but overall a lot of fun. There isn't really much more that can be said about this movie other than it is a movie you need to see if you haven't. Overall, Dazed and Confused is timeless fun that can be enjoyed by anyone. It shows the ease of summer and in a way defined a decade. The music was great, the story was good enough, the acting was fine, it was funny, touching, and a lot of fun. I love this movie and I can see it anywhere, anytime. This is a great movie to see with friends, it is probably better with friends and is also a good background movie at party of something. I suggest you don't look into this movie too much but rather enjoy it for what it is, mindless fun. Dazed and Confused gets the WillyT Honorable Mention., so go watch it and enjoy and remember the days of drinking as a kid.

    There's really no story but it's not necessary for this flick; it's more of a hang-out movie. The movie brings you to the last day of school and summer is just around the corner. You get to see teens having fun, drinking beer and smoking pot. This is a time machine for everyone that was a teen in the 70's. The movie has a great soundtrack that I enjoyed to the fullest, especially when they end the movie with Slater sitting in the backseat of a Chevelle blowing out marijuana smoke while the Chevelle drives towards the horizon with Foghat's Slow Ride playing in the background. It's a really cool movie and I think every teen should watch it at least once in their lifetime. I give it a 10 because it's a great movie and I can relate so much to it.

    After watching Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise, Sunset I was moved and looked up his other movies and this title caught my attention. I got it and saw it recently. The plot is one which we all can connect with, which is the last day of school (probably not the part where all the drinking and smoking, getting wasted, laid happens). The craziness, rawness, carelessness of youth at that point of time is displayed on screen with much clarity. The dialogs are well written. The characters are all unique and have all performed well. We can connect to each of the character in the movie. Some are nerds, discussing deep, philosophical matters, theories, etc, who are decent and less violent as compared to the other groups. Some are violent, rash, rude and have all those character traits of a person, our parents warn us to stay away from. They make a joke of authority, care least about their own future and get involved in drugs, smoking, drinking etc. There's a line by a character in the movie which goes something on the lines of "if life's so short then we should enjoy it to the maximum while we are alive". Some kids take it too seriously and ruin their lives. I almost felt like talking to these kids and telling them its not the way of life, and that they are wasting their lives' best days. But then they would scoff at any such idea which stops them from enjoying. Some parts are very funny. Whenever Slater comes on screen, its hilarious. And there are parts where we can see how vulnerable some of the characters are to find someone to fall in love with. There is some great sound tracks running in the background which sets the mood for the 70's. Some great dialogs too. There is no conclusion shown but that bitter-sweet period is captured brilliantly. I rate it 7/10.

    All I knew about this film was that it was a pot smoking, 1970's-set film starring Matthew McConaughey. After finally seeing the nearly 20-year old film, I was virtually left Dazed and Confused on the only other "fact" I knew about it: this was supposed to be a comedy. This movie NEVER made me laugh. I will admit it did have me snickering a few times, namely a pregnant woman who was simultaneously smoking and being lectured on the healthy habits of calcium and another girl getting her tight jean's zipper up with pliers. Other than that, I found absolutely nothing funny about the lame story of horny and disorderly punks leaving their junior year of high school and entering summer, all in one night. Allow me to back track, I'm guessing some of this is about Juniors in High School, and some about Seniors. My suspicion was that this was SUPPOSED to be about seniors, as some of the graffiti and Junior High Abuse indicated, but the majority were being coached on their final year in High School and their football careers. So, I guess this was about all ages  Junior High to Freshmen to Juniors in High School to Seniors to Already Graduated Losers. Was that the intention of the writers? Not sure, but I am sure, I only saw this as a drama about a bunch of unruly, irresponsible adolescences who spend one night in May drinking, pot-smoking, complaining and destroying lives and property for the sole purpose ofnothing. So much so, there was a great quote two-thirds in and I love it when a character sums up the movie in the dialogue: "Fairly uneventful, huh?" Yep, that defines the movie. Heck, despite the clich&eacute;s, the movie was pumping for a "raging" or "epic" party, but was shut down by one kid's mistakes, so the "graduating" kids simply drive around for the rest of the film, destroying anything or anyone in their path. Okay, fine, they do make it to one minor field party, but that was about one-one-thousandths of the "Woodstock" I'm sure it was trying to imitate. Going back to my original take on this, prior to my first (and only) viewing of Dazed and Confused, I thought Matthew McConaughey was supposed to be in this. Well, he was. Kind of. You just have to wait until half the movie was over and even then, he's such an extremely minor backdrop, he barely matters. In fact, no one really matters here. The film just follows these uninteresting teens through the course of one night of debauchery. Booooooring. If this really happened to me, and I was their age in 1976 (I had just turned two at the time), I would say the same thing then: This is boring. And apparently, I'm not alone: these characters feel the same way. Maybe, that was the point. Maybe they just wanted to show us the average night of no-nothings with no futures. Fine. If that's the point, I'll just watch You-Tube. To fans of this movie, please send me a note to explain what I am missing. I think I pretty much summed it up by saying this was about nothing. At least when Seinfeld made a career of that, he made it funny.

    Dazed & Confused is my favourite film of all time. I have no idea how many times I've seen it, but every watch is as enjoyable as the last. I was born five months after the seventies finished, in the UK. So as far as the social realism of the movie goes, I cannot comment. However in a very broad sense there are two things which make me love this film so very much. Firstly, it's just so damn cool. The cars look amazing, the soundtrack is great, the clothes are effortlessly hip and the male and female leads (or as close is this film gets to leads) are the two people you would have loved to know at High School, regardless of the social circle you were in. It is incredibly quotable and although not obviously funny (it was poorly marketed as a comedy), these days different scenes crack me up every time I watch it. It is also NOT a stoner flick. Yes there's a fair bit of pot smoked in it, but only because there was a fair bit of pot smoked at that time. Not a single scene has pot smoking as its focus  it's just there, like the music, the clothes or the high school football stadium. Secondly and more importantly, it is a far more subtle and realistic examination of high school life than just about anything else I've seen (The Last Picture Show comes close in its depiction during the 1950s). Yes there are "jocks", "cheerleaders" and "geeks", but they are not so rigid in their definition. They are all interlinked by people who have friends in many camps. They all have their flaws but like the vast majority of teenagers, almost all of them are generally good kids (bar one whose redeeming scene was cut). Even though it's the last day of school, Linklater doesn't focus on the obvious graduating seniors. Rather on next year's seniors and next year's freshmen. This is not a huge day in their lives and nothing life changing is going to happen. The year's big party gets busted before it even starts and they spend most of the night just driving around or at the local pool hall. Perhaps the most astounding thing is the sheer number of characters that RL fits in to the film. There is not one conversation which I would label as clich&eacute;d or forced to inform you of character, yet I have counted 22 main roles and by the end of the film you feel you really know all of them. I could go on to write an essay about why this film is so fine, but let me just finally say this. There's no defined plot, there's no first, second and third act as such and there are certainly no great resolutions (because how many resolutions to life's problems do you really encounter when you're a teenager?). However there are cool conversations, fun times, obstructive parents and awesome Foosball!!

    My mother gave me this movie on DVD as a present, since I love stoner comedies. This had potential, it had an all-star cast, a reputable director, and a catchy title. The first twelve minutes were promising, high school is almost over and the story seemed to be going in a positive direction. After those precious twelve minutes, this movie went completely downhill. There was no plot whatsoever, zero conflict, and undeveloped characters, things you do not want in a classic film. I was disappointed and I had never been so bored in my life watching a "comedy" that felt like an eternity to finish. There is only ONE funny scene worth watching and that's the part where the hippie talks about George Washington smoking weed. Other than that, I cannot believe this project got made in the first place. It doesn't even count as a real movie, but I digress! If you want to watch an overrated movie that is boring and has no redeeming qualities to it, then this is the movie for you. I'm glad I shared my opinion and by the way, I sold the DVD after watching this piece of garbage for the third time.

    Loved this movie when it came out, but with each successive viewing it seems smaller and less than its first impression. Undeniably, the Criterion package is beautiful (the booklet worth the price alone), but I'm surprised that they chose to put this film out at all. The nighttime cinematography is a serious thing of beauty, the performances are mostly good to brilliant, the music plumbs the depths of 70's trash rock with curatorial zeal. Still somehow, the finished product cruises about midway between the offhand brilliance of American Graffiti and the adolescent goofs of Porky's. Watching the deleted scenes, I think it may be that the movie just isn't long enough. What did they leave out? The girls, of course. With the bulk of screen time spent with the male characters - hazing and being hazed, the hardships of being a jock AND a freak, drink and drug rants. Why no room for the other, equally looped perspective which was actually filmed? Kaye's ongoing rants about sexism and politics followed by Shavonne's mockery were unnecessarily, ridiculously sacrificed (the actresses must have been livid when they saw they finished product). Why - for the sake of a tidy run time? It's a shame, and the final edit mimics Lucas's AG so precisely in neglecting the actresses (seldom on screen unless they're relating to a male character) that it almost seems programmatic (read: studio mandate - girls are boring). Maybe it wasn't outside interference, but I have some hope that Linklater will someday sit down and eek out a longer cut. And while he's at it replace that last throw away shot through the windshield. What the heck is that? Looks like Slater grabbed the camera, for chrissakes. By the way, the reviewer who said the depiction was Not Realistic At All - he graduated in 73 and clearly missed all that shortly followed. The mid-seventies were a hybridizing period. Every guy but the scuzziest badass had a slick nylon button up shirt, even people who hated disco. Hippie style was subverted/perverted by consumer culture, the natural look gone cartoon tawdry. The worst thing you could do in 1976 was try too hard (see if you can sell that to today's crop of attention seekers). Everyone looked ridiculous, but mellow ridiculous. No, the look and styling of this film is pretty spot-on, though everyone is too clean and the girl's makeup is way too flattering (mascara in the seventies was so globby it looked like spiders died on your eyes). Also, the main character's ride between the two social camps was one of the subtle touches that really made the movie work for me. Stoners were called freaks, and jocks who did drugs were frocks. There were plenty at my suburban nowhere school - one of them was a homecoming attendant and a well known (to the students) user. It made him popular with everyone, not unlike Randy Floyd. Sorry man - you checked out a little too early to authenticate this party buzz.

    Not sure where to begin with this movie. I first saw it at around 1am with my older brother around 2001 and as soon as the end credits rolled we watched it all over again. I've now seen Dazed and Confused over 30 times and it never fails to entertain me. Entertain is the wrong word. The best word that describes this movie (for me anyway) is 'feeling'. Its a feeling. I wasn't even born until the early 80s but there's something about this movie that just captures my childhood. Probably that summer feeling. Again that word pops up. The characters, soundtrack, setting. Its just perfect. Everything i never knew i wanted in a film all lining up to capture a feeling i never want to forget. Whether i experienced the same as the characters or not i just can't help but watch this movie over and over again. Whether it be in the background while i'm procrastinating or i if i just want to 'feel'. Again these words don't really begin to sum up my true feelings about this movie. I just can't explain it. Its a special film and no other film will probably ever make me feel this way ever again.

    Often referred to as a cult classic, Dazed and Confused lives up to its name in every way. After his excellent directorial debut, Richard Linklater, who was considered an important up-and-coming director hit every right note in his second feature, cementing his status as one of America's most exciting filmmakers. Even today, the film holds up really well and makes for a non-stop entertaining picture. The film takes place in the 1970's over the course of one day, the last day of school. Seniors have now officially finished and they are looking for new freshman to 'initiate' which they usually do by means of bullying. Its something that would not fly today but very easily could have been tradition in the past. Where the film strives in its realism is in what these kids do on this last day of school, they party. And a filmmaker like Linklater is perfect for this because of his gift to let characters just walk in and out of the frame and follow a collective group instead of just a few characters. He doesn't just make a few characters stand out, he gives the whole school character. The film stars some actors that are a lot more well known currently than when this film was released, such as Ben Affleck, Matthew McConaughey, so on and so forth. The entire cast turns in serviceable performances and it makes for one of the more entertaining ensembles to come out of the 90s. With a cast as large as this, it could be easy to make the film too clouded and unfocused, but this is one of Linklater's specialties. He captures an important human connection on film that resonates with us viewers and its part of the large voice he has in American independent cinema. Linklater appropriately uses music in this film. He chooses songs that we're all familiar with and plays them amongst parts where they're most appropriate; such as playing School's Out by Alice Cooper when school is actually out.

The film thrives with realism. This may be Linklater's most mainstream-appealing independent feature as a director. Slacker could be pretty divisive, its lack of plot could throw off a lot of viewers. Dazed and Confused also doesn't have much of a plot but this film appeals to a large group of people because of how well Linklater captured a familiar experience onto film to which we can all relate to.

We can connect to each of the character in the movie. Some are nerds, discussing deep, philosophical matters, theories, etc, who are decent and less violent as compared to the other groups. Some are violent, rash, rude and have all those character traits of a person, our parents warn us to stay away from. They make a joke of authority, care least about their own future and get involved in drugs, smoking, drinking etc. There's a line by a character in the movie which goes something on the lines of "if life's so short then we should enjoy it to the maximum while we are alive". Some kids take it too seriously and ruin their lives. I almost felt like talking to these kids and telling them its not the way of life, and that they are wasting their lives' best days. But then they would scoff at any such idea which stops them from enjoying. Some parts are very funny. Whenever Slater comes on screen, its hilarious. And there are parts where we can see how vulnerable some of the characters are to find someone to fall in love with. There is some great sound tracks running in the background which sets the mood for the 70's. Some great dialogs too. There is no conclusion shown but that bitter-sweet period is captured brilliantly. I rate it 7/10.

    All I knew about this film was that it was a pot smoking, 1970's-set film starring Matthew McConaughey. After finally seeing the nearly 20-year old film, I was virtually left Dazed and Confused on the only other "fact" I knew about it: this was supposed to be a comedy. This movie NEVER made me laugh. I will admit it did have me snickering a few times, namely a pregnant woman who was simultaneously smoking and being lectured on the healthy habits of calcium and another girl getting her tight jean's zipper up with pliers. Other than that, I found absolutely nothing funny about the lame story of horny and disorderly punks leaving their junior year of high school and entering summer, all in one night. Allow me to back track, I'm guessing some of this is about Juniors in High School, and some about Seniors. My suspicion was that this was SUPPOSED to be about seniors, as some of the graffiti and Junior High Abuse indicated, but the majority were being coached on their final year in High School and their football careers. So, I guess this was about all ages  Junior High to Freshmen to Juniors in High School to Seniors to Already Graduated Losers. Was that the intention of the writers? Not sure, but I am sure, I only saw this as a drama about a bunch of unruly, irresponsible adolescences who spend one night in May drinking, pot-smoking, complaining and destroying lives and property for the sole purpose ofnothing. So much so, there was a great quote two-thirds in and I love it when a character sums up the movie in the dialogue: "Fairly uneventful, huh?" Yep, that defines the movie. Heck, despite the clich&eacute;s, the movie was pumping for a "raging" or "epic" party, but was shut down by one kid's mistakes, so the "graduating" kids simply drive around for the rest of the film, destroying anything or anyone in their path. Okay, fine, they do make it to one minor field party, but that was about one-one-thousandths of the "Woodstock" I'm sure it was trying to imitate. Going back to my original take on this, prior to my first (and only) viewing of Dazed and Confused, I thought Matthew McConaughey was supposed to be in this. Well, he was. Kind of. You just have to wait until half the movie was over and even then, he's such an extremely minor backdrop, he barely matters. In fact, no one really matters here. The film just follows these uninteresting teens through the course of one night of debauchery. Booooooring. If this really happened to me, and I was their age in 1976 (I had just turned two at the time), I would say the same thing then: This is boring. And apparently, I'm not alone: these characters feel the same way. Maybe, that was the point. Maybe they just wanted to show us the average night of no-nothings with no futures. Fine. If that's the point, I'll just watch You-Tube. To fans of this movie, please send me a note to explain what I am missing. I think I pretty much summed it up by saying this was about nothing. At least when Seinfeld made a career of that, he made it funny.

    Dazed & Confused is my favourite film of all time. I have no idea how many times I've seen it, but every watch is as enjoyable as the last. I was born five months after the seventies finished, in the UK. So as far as the social realism of the movie goes, I cannot comment. However in a very broad sense there are two things which make me love this film so very much. Firstly, it's just so damn cool. The cars look amazing, the soundtrack is great, the clothes are effortlessly hip and the male and female leads (or as close is this film gets to leads) are the two people you would have loved to know at High School, regardless of the social circle you were in. It is incredibly quotable and although not obviously funny (it was poorly marketed as a comedy), these days different scenes crack me up every time I watch it. It is also NOT a stoner flick. Yes there's a fair bit of pot smoked in it, but only because there was a fair bit of pot smoked at that time. Not a single scene has pot smoking as its focus  it's just there, like the music, the clothes or the high school football stadium. Secondly and more importantly, it is a far more subtle and realistic examination of high school life than just about anything else I've seen (The Last Picture Show comes close in its depiction during the 1950s). Yes there are "jocks", "cheerleaders" and "geeks", but they are not so rigid in their definition. They are all interlinked by people who have friends in many camps. They all have their flaws but like the vast majority of teenagers, almost all of them are generally good kids (bar one whose redeeming scene was cut). Even though it's the last day of school, Linklater doesn't focus on the obvious graduating seniors. Rather on next year's seniors and next year's freshmen. This is not a huge day in their lives and nothing life changing is going to happen. The year's big party gets busted before it even starts and they spend most of the night just driving around or at the local pool hall. Perhaps the most astounding thing is the sheer number of characters that RL fits in to the film. There is not one conversation which I would label as clich&eacute;d or forced to inform you of character, yet I have counted 22 main roles and by the end of the film you feel you really know all of them. I could go on to write an essay about why this film is so fine, but let me just finally say this. There's no defined plot, there's no first, second and third act as such and there are certainly no great resolutions (because how many resolutions to life's problems do you really encounter when you're a teenager?). However there are cool conversations, fun times, obstructive parents and awesome Foosball!!

    My mother gave me this movie on DVD as a present, since I love stoner comedies. This had potential, it had an all-star cast, a reputable director, and a catchy title. The first twelve minutes were promising, high school is almost over and the story seemed to be going in a positive direction. After those precious twelve minutes, this movie went completely downhill. There was no plot whatsoever, zero conflict, and undeveloped characters, things you do not want in a classic film. I was disappointed and I had never been so bored in my life watching a "comedy" that felt like an eternity to finish. There is only ONE funny scene worth watching and that's the part where the hippie talks about George Washington smoking weed. Other than that, I cannot believe this project got made in the first place. It doesn't even count as a real movie, but I digress! If you want to watch an overrated movie that is boring and has no redeeming qualities to it, then this is the movie for you. I'm glad I shared my opinion and by the way, I sold the DVD after watching this piece of garbage for the third time.

    Loved this movie when it came out, but with each successive viewing it seems smaller and less than its first impression. Undeniably, the Criterion package is beautiful (the booklet worth the price alone), but I'm surprised that they chose to put this film out at all. The nighttime cinematography is a serious thing of beauty, the performances are mostly good to brilliant, the music plumbs the depths of 70's trash rock with curatorial zeal. Still somehow, the finished product cruises about midway between the offhand brilliance of American Graffiti and the adolescent goofs of Porky's. Watching the deleted scenes, I think it may be that the movie just isn't long enough. What did they leave out? The girls, of course. With the bulk of screen time spent with the male characters - hazing and being hazed, the hardships of being a jock AND a freak, drink and drug rants. Why no room for the other, equally looped perspective which was actually filmed? Kaye's ongoing rants about sexism and politics followed by Shavonne's mockery were unnecessarily, ridiculously sacrificed (the actresses must have been livid when they saw they finished product). Why - for the sake of a tidy run time? It's a shame, and the final edit mimics Lucas's AG so precisely in neglecting the actresses (seldom on screen unless they're relating to a male character) that it almost seems programmatic (read: studio mandate - girls are boring). Maybe it wasn't outside interference, but I have some hope that Linklater will someday sit down and eek out a longer cut. And while he's at it replace that last throw away shot through the windshield. What the heck is that? Looks like Slater grabbed the camera, for chrissakes. By the way, the reviewer who said the depiction was Not Realistic At All - he graduated in 73 and clearly missed all that shortly followed. The mid-seventies were a hybridizing period. Every guy but the scuzziest badass had a slick nylon button up shirt, even people who hated disco. Hippie style was subverted/perverted by consumer culture, the natural look gone cartoon tawdry. The worst thing you could do in 1976 was try too hard (see if you can sell that to today's crop of attention seekers). Everyone looked ridiculous, but mellow ridiculous. No, the look and styling of this film is pretty spot-on, though everyone is too clean and the girl's makeup is way too flattering (mascara in the seventies was so globby it looked like spiders died on your eyes). Also, the main character's ride between the two social camps was one of the subtle touches that really made the movie work for me. Stoners were called freaks, and jocks who did drugs were frocks. There were plenty at my suburban nowhere school - one of them was a homecoming attendant and a well known (to the students) user. It made him popular with everyone, not unlike Randy Floyd. Sorry man - you checked out a little too early to authenticate this party buzz.

    Not sure where to begin with this movie. I first saw it at around 1am with my older brother around 2001 and as soon as the end credits rolled we watched it all over again. I've now seen Dazed and Confused over 30 times and it never fails to entertain me. Entertain is the wrong word. The best word that describes this movie (for me anyway) is 'feeling'. Its a feeling. I wasn't even born until the early 80s but there's something about this movie that just captures my childhood. Probably that summer feeling. Again that word pops up. The characters, soundtrack, setting. Its just perfect. Everything i never knew i wanted in a film all lining up to capture a feeling i never want to forget. Whether i experienced the same as the characters or not i just can't help but watch this movie over and over again. Whether it be in the background while i'm procrastinating or i if i just want to 'feel'. Again these words don't really begin to sum up my true feelings about this movie. I just can't explain it. Its a special film and no other film will probably ever make me feel this way ever again.

    Often referred to as a cult classic, Dazed and Confused lives up to its name in every way. After his excellent directorial debut, Richard Linklater, who was considered an important up-and-coming director hit every right note in his second feature, cementing his status as one of America's most exciting filmmakers. Even today, the film holds up really well and makes for a non-stop entertaining picture. The film takes place in the 1970's over the course of one day, the last day of school. Seniors have now officially finished and they are looking for new freshman to 'initiate' which they usually do by means of bullying. Its something that would not fly today but very easily could have been tradition in the past. Where the film strives in its realism is in what these kids do on this last day of school, they party. And a filmmaker like Linklater is perfect for this because of his gift to let characters just walk in and out of the frame and follow a collective group instead of just a few characters. He doesn't just make a few characters stand out, he gives the whole school character. The film stars some actors that are a lot more well known currently than when this film was released, such as Ben Affleck, Matthew McConaughey, so on and so forth. The entire cast turns in serviceable performances and it makes for one of the more entertaining ensembles to come out of the 90s. With a cast as large as this, it could be easy to make the film too clouded and unfocused, but this is one of Linklater's specialties. He captures an important human connection on film that resonates with us viewers and its part of the large voice he has in American independent cinema. Linklater appropriately uses music in this film. He chooses songs that we're all familiar with and plays them amongst parts where they're most appropriate; such as playing School's Out by Alice Cooper when school is actually out. Its obvious but fitting since these songs were huge during this time period and it accurately captures the feel of that era. Here we aren't exposed to over-the-top 70's clothing and disco-influenced culture, but we get familiarized with a setting where we could easily see our parents growing up in. The film thrives with realism. This may be Linklater's most mainstream-appealing independent feature as a director. Slacker could be pretty divisive, its lack of plot could throw off a lot of viewers. Dazed and Confused also doesn't have much of a plot but this film appeals to a large group of people because of how well Linklater captured a familiar experience onto film to which we can all relate to. It makes for one of the most enjoyable films to come from the 90's and stands out as one of the director's most accomplished features.

    I went to high school in the early 70s. D&C does capture some of the fun of that era before AIDS, 9-11, Homeland Security, locker searches or much of the junk we put up with in 2013. In the Northeast we never had Freshman hazing, so I found that stuff a bit hard to relate to. I read here that was common in Texas high schools. I would recommend D&C not as great filmmaking but simply a fun look back at high school in a unique time that only lasted a few years. For young people that want to get a feel for the 70s, watch this film. Also see Fast Times at Ridgemont High and the first two seasons of That 70s Show. Freaking awesome, dude!

    That's the thing about movies, man, no matter how many times I watch them they stay the exact same. Alright, alright, alright, it's the beginning of summer for me so that can only mean one thing. I watched Dazed and Confused. The year is 1976 and it is the first day of summer. Seniors abuse freshman and then go party. This is the story of one wild and crazy night from many different perspectives. This was a classic and it is timeless. There is everything in this movie from stoners to nerds to jocks to normal people. You get a sense of what high school was like back in the day. The main characters are Pink, the senior quarterback, and Mitch the upcoming freshman. There a lot of other lovable characters like the creepy Matthew McConaughey , the big bully Ben Affleck, and everything in-between. Pink is pressured from coaches to sign a waiver for next year's season and he doesn't know what he wants to do. This is a subtle problem that carries throughout the entire movie, which adds a spice to the movie. Mitch struggles with the annual beating from the seniors but soon comes to his own and finds out what high school is all about. The high school atmosphere in the 70s was incredible, I almost wish I was 18 back then. The stuff these kids got away with. The way they acted in school on the last day with the smoking weed outside and throwing papers everywhere. The group of guys is driving and take trash barrels and destroy mail boxes. Something like that would never happen today. The most disturbing scene was the hazing of the freshman girls. They poured ketchup and mustard on them and made them all gross. Hazing is a terrible thing but at least the movie made it funny. It is weird how they can abuse them one second and then a few hours later they are parrying with the girls they abused. The 70s was a weird decade. The 70s was a messed up decade but it did have killer music. Every scene had a perfect editing of music. Everything from Zeppelin to Ozzy to Kansas. The school bell rings and Alice Cooper's Schools Out blares and it was picture perfect. Music makes a movie, I say it all the time, music makes the movie, and the music made this movie. There was no original score, which is a little strange, but I knew every song they played and I love that kind of music so it made me very happy. My favorite character was the biggest stoner I have ever seen on the big screen. I forget his name but he has the long hair and the backwards cap and he is high in very scene. He speaks complete nonsense about the founding fathers and the cosmos and it is hilarious. It is between him and the Jewish guy from Saving Private Ryan. He plays a nerd who rambles on and on. Sometimes he makes sense and sometimes you just want him to shut up. His character has a lot of development and his group of friends is entertaining. So let's break this movie down. The plot is fantastic, the scenes themselves are well put together and there is really no boring part. There are a lot of characters so it can be a little difficult to follow but all are unique and mesh together perfectly. The acting wasn't remarkable but for the purpose of the movie it worked. The movie isn't really about the story or the deep emotions of the characters. It is strictly about the crazy antics of high school seniors. It is a night we all wish we could have. There are a few reality checks and unbelievable moments but overall a lot of fun. There isn't really much more that can be said about this movie other than it is a movie you need to see if you haven't. Overall, Dazed and Confused is timeless fun that can be enjoyed by anyone. It shows the ease of summer and in a way defined a decade. The music was great, the story was good enough, the acting was fine, it was funny, touching, and a lot of fun. I love this movie and I can see it anywhere, anytime. This is a great movie to see with friends, it is probably better with friends and is also a good background movie at party of something. I suggest you don't look into this movie too much but rather enjoy it for what it is, mindless fun. Dazed and Confused gets the WillyT Honorable Mention., so go watch it and enjoy and remember the days of drinking as a kid.

    There's really no story but it's not necessary for this flick; it's more of a hang-out movie. The movie brings you to the last day of school and summer is just around the corner. You get to see teens having fun, drinking beer and smoking pot. This is a time machine for everyone that was a teen in the 70's. The movie has a great soundtrack that I enjoyed to the fullest, especially when they end the movie with Slater sitting in the backseat of a Chevelle blowing out marijuana smoke while the Chevelle drives towards the horizon with Foghat's Slow Ride playing in the background. It's a really cool movie and I think every teen should watch it at least once in their lifetime. I give it a 10 because it's a great movie and I can relate so much to it.

    After watching Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise, Sunset I was moved and looked up his other movies and this title caught my attention. I got it and saw it recently. The plot is one which we all can connect with, which is the last day of school (probably not the part where all the drinking and smoking, getting wasted, laid happens). The craziness, rawness, carelessness of youth at that point of time is displayed on screen with much clarity. The dialogs are well written. The characters are all unique and have all performed well. We can connect to each of the character in the movie. Some are nerds, discussing deep, philosophical matters, theories, etc, who are decent and less violent as compared to the other groups. Some are violent, rash, rude and have all those character traits of a person, our parents warn us to stay away from. They make a joke of authority, care least about their own future and get involved in drugs, smoking, drinking etc. There's a line by a character in the movie which goes something on the lines of "if life's so short then we should enjoy it to the maximum while we are alive". Some kids take it too seriously and ruin their lives. I almost felt like talking to these kids and telling them its not the way of life, and that they are wasting their lives' best days.

I was disappointed and I had never been so bored in my life watching a "comedy" that felt like an eternity to finish. There is only ONE funny scene worth watching and that's the part where the hippie talks about George Washington smoking weed. Other than that, I cannot believe this project got made in the first place. It doesn't even count as a real movie, but I digress! If you want to watch an overrated movie that is boring and has no redeeming qualities to it, then this is the movie for you. I'm glad I shared my opinion and by the way, I sold the DVD after watching this piece of garbage for the third time.

    Loved this movie when it came out, but with each successive viewing it seems smaller and less than its first impression. Undeniably, the Criterion package is beautiful (the booklet worth the price alone), but I'm surprised that they chose to put this film out at all. The nighttime cinematography is a serious thing of beauty, the performances are mostly good to brilliant, the music plumbs the depths of 70's trash rock with curatorial zeal. Still somehow, the finished product cruises about midway between the offhand brilliance of American Graffiti and the adolescent goofs of Porky's. Watching the deleted scenes, I think it may be that the movie just isn't long enough. What did they leave out? The girls, of course. With the bulk of screen time spent with the male characters - hazing and being hazed, the hardships of being a jock AND a freak, drink and drug rants. Why no room for the other, equally looped perspective which was actually filmed? Kaye's ongoing rants about sexism and politics followed by Shavonne's mockery were unnecessarily, ridiculously sacrificed (the actresses must have been livid when they saw they finished product). Why - for the sake of a tidy run time? It's a shame, and the final edit mimics Lucas's AG so precisely in neglecting the actresses (seldom on screen unless they're relating to a male character) that it almost seems programmatic (read: studio mandate - girls are boring). Maybe it wasn't outside interference, but I have some hope that Linklater will someday sit down and eek out a longer cut. And while he's at it replace that last throw away shot through the windshield. What the heck is that? Looks like Slater grabbed the camera, for chrissakes. By the way, the reviewer who said the depiction was Not Realistic At All - he graduated in 73 and clearly missed all that shortly followed. The mid-seventies were a hybridizing period. Every guy but the scuzziest badass had a slick nylon button up shirt, even people who hated disco. Hippie style was subverted/perverted by consumer culture, the natural look gone cartoon tawdry. The worst thing you could do in 1976 was try too hard (see if you can sell that to today's crop of attention seekers). Everyone looked ridiculous, but mellow ridiculous. No, the look and styling of this film is pretty spot-on, though everyone is too clean and the girl's makeup is way too flattering (mascara in the seventies was so globby it looked like spiders died on your eyes). Also, the main character's ride between the two social camps was one of the subtle touches that really made the movie work for me. Stoners were called freaks, and jocks who did drugs were frocks. There were plenty at my suburban nowhere school - one of them was a homecoming attendant and a well known (to the students) user. It made him popular with everyone, not unlike Randy Floyd. Sorry man - you checked out a little too early to authenticate this party buzz.

    Not sure where to begin with this movie. I first saw it at around 1am with my older brother around 2001 and as soon as the end credits rolled we watched it all over again. I've now seen Dazed and Confused over 30 times and it never fails to entertain me. Entertain is the wrong word. The best word that describes this movie (for me anyway) is 'feeling'. Its a feeling. I wasn't even born until the early 80s but there's something about this movie that just captures my childhood. Probably that summer feeling. Again that word pops up. The characters, soundtrack, setting. Its just perfect. Everything i never knew i wanted in a film all lining up to capture a feeling i never want to forget. Whether i experienced the same as the characters or not i just can't help but watch this movie over and over again. Whether it be in the background while i'm procrastinating or i if i just want to 'feel'. Again these words don't really begin to sum up my true feelings about this movie. I just can't explain it. Its a special film and no other film will probably ever make me feel this way ever again.

    Often referred to as a cult classic, Dazed and Confused lives up to its name in every way. After his excellent directorial debut, Richard Linklater, who was considered an important up-and-coming director hit every right note in his second feature, cementing his status as one of America's most exciting filmmakers. Even today, the film holds up really well and makes for a non-stop entertaining picture. The film takes place in the 1970's over the course of one day, the last day of school. Seniors have now officially finished and they are looking for new freshman to 'initiate' which they usually do by means of bullying. Its something that would not fly today but very easily could have been tradition in the past. Where the film strives in its realism is in what these kids do on this last day of school, they party. And a filmmaker like Linklater is perfect for this because of his gift to let characters just walk in and out of the frame and follow a collective group instead of just a few characters. He doesn't just make a few characters stand out, he gives the whole school character. The film stars some actors that are a lot more well known currently than when this film was released, such as Ben Affleck, Matthew McConaughey, so on and so forth. The entire cast turns in serviceable performances and it makes for one of the more entertaining ensembles to come out of the 90s. With a cast as large as this, it could be easy to make the film too clouded and unfocused, but this is one of Linklater's specialties. He captures an important human connection on film that resonates with us viewers and its part of the large voice he has in American independent cinema. Linklater appropriately uses music in this film. He chooses songs that we're all familiar with and plays them amongst parts where they're most appropriate; such as playing School's Out by Alice Cooper when school is actually out. Its obvious but fitting since these songs were huge during this time period and it accurately captures the feel of that era. Here we aren't exposed to over-the-top 70's clothing and disco-influenced culture, but we get familiarized with a setting where we could easily see our parents growing up in. The film thrives with realism. This may be Linklater's most mainstream-appealing independent feature as a director. Slacker could be pretty divisive, its lack of plot could throw off a lot of viewers. Dazed and Confused also doesn't have much of a plot but this film appeals to a large group of people because of how well Linklater captured a familiar experience onto film to which we can all relate to. It makes for one of the most enjoyable films to come from the 90's and stands out as one of the director's most accomplished features.

    I went to high school in the early 70s. D&C does capture some of the fun of that era before AIDS, 9-11, Homeland Security, locker searches or much of the junk we put up with in 2013. In the Northeast we never had Freshman hazing, so I found that stuff a bit hard to relate to. I read here that was common in Texas high schools. I would recommend D&C not as great filmmaking but simply a fun look back at high school in a unique time that only lasted a few years. For young people that want to get a feel for the 70s, watch this film. Also see Fast Times at Ridgemont High and the first two seasons of That 70s Show. Freaking awesome, dude!

    That's the thing about movies, man, no matter how many times I watch them they stay the exact same. Alright, alright, alright, it's the beginning of summer for me so that can only mean one thing. I watched Dazed and Confused. The year is 1976 and it is the first day of summer. Seniors abuse freshman and then go party. This is the story of one wild and crazy night from many different perspectives. This was a classic and it is timeless. There is everything in this movie from stoners to nerds to jocks to normal people. You get a sense of what high school was like back in the day. The main characters are Pink, the senior quarterback, and Mitch the upcoming freshman. There a lot of other lovable characters like the creepy Matthew McConaughey , the big bully Ben Affleck, and everything in-between. Pink is pressured from coaches to sign a waiver for next year's season and he doesn't know what he wants to do. This is a subtle problem that carries throughout the entire movie, which adds a spice to the movie. Mitch struggles with the annual beating from the seniors but soon comes to his own and finds out what high school is all about. The high school atmosphere in the 70s was incredible, I almost wish I was 18 back then. The stuff these kids got away with. The way they acted in school on the last day with the smoking weed outside and throwing papers everywhere. The group of guys is driving and take trash barrels and destroy mail boxes. Something like that would never happen today. The most disturbing scene was the hazing of the freshman girls. They poured ketchup and mustard on them and made them all gross. Hazing is a terrible thing but at least the movie made it funny. It is weird how they can abuse them one second and then a few hours later they are parrying with the girls they abused. The 70s was a weird decade. The 70s was a messed up decade but it did have killer music. Every scene had a perfect editing of music. Everything from Zeppelin to Ozzy to Kansas. The school bell rings and Alice Cooper's Schools Out blares and it was picture perfect. Music makes a movie, I say it all the time, music makes the movie, and the music made this movie. There was no original score, which is a little strange, but I knew every song they played and I love that kind of music so it made me very happy. My favorite character was the biggest stoner I have ever seen on the big screen. I forget his name but he has the long hair and the backwards cap and he is high in very scene. He speaks complete nonsense about the founding fathers and the cosmos and it is hilarious. It is between him and the Jewish guy from Saving Private Ryan. He plays a nerd who rambles on and on. Sometimes he makes sense and sometimes you just want him to shut up. His character has a lot of development and his group of friends is entertaining. So let's break this movie down. The plot is fantastic, the scenes themselves are well put together and there is really no boring part. There are a lot of characters so it can be a little difficult to follow but all are unique and mesh together perfectly. The acting wasn't remarkable but for the purpose of the movie it worked. The movie isn't really about the story or the deep emotions of the characters. It is strictly about the crazy antics of high school seniors. It is a night we all wish we could have. There are a few reality checks and unbelievable moments but overall a lot of fun. There isn't really much more that can be said about this movie other than it is a movie you need to see if you haven't. Overall, Dazed and Confused is timeless fun that can be enjoyed by anyone. It shows the ease of summer and in a way defined a decade. The music was great, the story was good enough, the acting was fine, it was funny, touching, and a lot of fun. I love this movie and I can see it anywhere, anytime. This is a great movie to see with friends, it is probably better with friends and is also a good background movie at party of something. I suggest you don't look into this movie too much but rather enjoy it for what it is, mindless fun. Dazed and Confused gets the WillyT Honorable Mention., so go watch it and enjoy and remember the days of drinking as a kid.

    There's really no story but it's not necessary for this flick; it's more of a hang-out movie. The movie brings you to the last day of school and summer is just around the corner. You get to see teens having fun, drinking beer and smoking pot. This is a time machine for everyone that was a teen in the 70's. The movie has a great soundtrack that I enjoyed to the fullest, especially when they end the movie with Slater sitting in the backseat of a Chevelle blowing out marijuana smoke while the Chevelle drives towards the horizon with Foghat's Slow Ride playing in the background. It's a really cool movie and I think every teen should watch it at least once in their lifetime. I give it a 10 because it's a great movie and I can relate so much to it.

    After watching Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise, Sunset I was moved and looked up his other movies and this title caught my attention. I got it and saw it recently. The plot is one which we all can connect with, which is the last day of school (probably not the part where all the drinking and smoking, getting wasted, laid happens). The craziness, rawness, carelessness of youth at that point of time is displayed on screen with much clarity. The dialogs are well written. The characters are all unique and have all performed well. We can connect to each of the character in the movie. Some are nerds, discussing deep, philosophical matters, theories, etc, who are decent and less violent as compared to the other groups. Some are violent, rash, rude and have all those character traits of a person, our parents warn us to stay away from. They make a joke of authority, care least about their own future and get involved in drugs, smoking, drinking etc. There's a line by a character in the movie which goes something on the lines of "if life's so short then we should enjoy it to the maximum while we are alive". Some kids take it too seriously and ruin their lives. I almost felt like talking to these kids and telling them its not the way of life, and that they are wasting their lives' best days. But then they would scoff at any such idea which stops them from enjoying. Some parts are very funny. Whenever Slater comes on screen, its hilarious. And there are parts where we can see how vulnerable some of the characters are to find someone to fall in love with. There is some great sound tracks running in the background which sets the mood for the 70's. Some great dialogs too. There is no conclusion shown but that bitter-sweet period is captured brilliantly. I rate it 7/10.

    All I knew about this film was that it was a pot smoking, 1970's-set film starring Matthew McConaughey. After finally seeing the nearly 20-year old film, I was virtually left Dazed and Confused on the only other "fact" I knew about it: this was supposed to be a comedy. This movie NEVER made me laugh. I will admit it did have me snickering a few times, namely a pregnant woman who was simultaneously smoking and being lectured on the healthy habits of calcium and another girl getting her tight jean's zipper up with pliers. Other than that, I found absolutely nothing funny about the lame story of horny and disorderly punks leaving their junior year of high school and entering summer, all in one night. Allow me to back track, I'm guessing some of this is about Juniors in High School, and some about Seniors. My suspicion was that this was SUPPOSED to be about seniors, as some of the graffiti and Junior High Abuse indicated, but the majority were being coached on their final year in High School and their football careers. So, I guess this was about all ages  Junior High to Freshmen to Juniors in High School to Seniors to Already Graduated Losers. Was that the intention of the writers? Not sure, but I am sure, I only saw this as a drama about a bunch of unruly, irresponsible adolescences who spend one night in May drinking, pot-smoking, complaining and destroying lives and property for the sole purpose ofnothing. So much so, there was a great quote two-thirds in and I love it when a character sums up the movie in the dialogue: "Fairly uneventful, huh?" Yep, that defines the movie. Heck, despite the clich&eacute;s, the movie was pumping for a "raging" or "epic" party, but was shut down by one kid's mistakes, so the "graduating" kids simply drive around for the rest of the film, destroying anything or anyone in their path. Okay, fine, they do make it to one minor field party, but that was about one-one-thousandths of the "Woodstock" I'm sure it was trying to imitate. Going back to my original take on this, prior to my first (and only) viewing of Dazed and Confused, I thought Matthew McConaughey was supposed to be in this. Well, he was. Kind of. You just have to wait until half the movie was over and even then, he's such an extremely minor backdrop, he barely matters. In fact, no one really matters here. The film just follows these uninteresting teens through the course of one night of debauchery. Booooooring. If this really happened to me, and I was their age in 1976 (I had just turned two at the time), I would say the same thing then: This is boring. And apparently, I'm not alone: these characters feel the same way. Maybe, that was the point. Maybe they just wanted to show us the average night of no-nothings with no futures. Fine. If that's the point, I'll just watch You-Tube. To fans of this movie, please send me a note to explain what I am missing. I think I pretty much summed it up by saying this was about nothing. At least when Seinfeld made a career of that, he made it funny.

    Dazed & Confused is my favourite film of all time. I have no idea how many times I've seen it, but every watch is as enjoyable as the last. I was born five months after the seventies finished, in the UK. So as far as the social realism of the movie goes, I cannot comment. However in a very broad sense there are two things which make me love this film so very much. Firstly, it's just so damn cool. The cars look amazing, the soundtrack is great, the clothes are effortlessly hip and the male and female leads (or as close is this film gets to leads) are the two people you would have loved to know at High School, regardless of the social circle you were in. It is incredibly quotable and although not obviously funny (it was poorly marketed as a comedy), these days different scenes crack me up every time I watch it. It is also NOT a stoner flick. Yes there's a fair bit of pot smoked in it, but only because there was a fair bit of pot smoked at that time. Not a single scene has pot smoking as its focus  it's just there, like the music, the clothes or the high school football stadium. Secondly and more importantly, it is a far more subtle and realistic examination of high school life than just about anything else I've seen (The Last Picture Show comes close in its depiction during the 1950s). Yes there are "jocks", "cheerleaders" and "geeks", but they are not so rigid in their definition. They are all interlinked by people who have friends in many camps. They all have their flaws but like the vast majority of teenagers, almost all of them are generally good kids (bar one whose redeeming scene was cut). Even though it's the last day of school, Linklater doesn't focus on the obvious graduating seniors. Rather on next year's seniors and next year's freshmen. This is not a huge day in their lives and nothing life changing is going to happen. The year's big party gets busted before it even starts and they spend most of the night just driving around or at the local pool hall. Perhaps the most astounding thing is the sheer number of characters that RL fits in to the film. There is not one conversation which I would label as clich&eacute;d or forced to inform you of character, yet I have counted 22 main roles and by the end of the film you feel you really know all of them. I could go on to write an essay about why this film is so fine, but let me just finally say this. There's no defined plot, there's no first, second and third act as such and there are certainly no great resolutions (because how many resolutions to life's problems do you really encounter when you're a teenager?). However there are cool conversations, fun times, obstructive parents and awesome Foosball!!

    My mother gave me this movie on DVD as a present, since I love stoner comedies. This had potential, it had an all-star cast, a reputable director, and a catchy title. The first twelve minutes were promising, high school is almost over and the story seemed to be going in a positive direction. After those precious twelve minutes, this movie went completely downhill. There was no plot whatsoever, zero conflict, and undeveloped characters, things you do not want in a classic film.

    I went to high school in the early 70s. D&C does capture some of the fun of that era before AIDS, 9-11, Homeland Security, locker searches or much of the junk we put up with in 2013. In the Northeast we never had Freshman hazing, so I found that stuff a bit hard to relate to. I read here that was common in Texas high schools. I would recommend D&C not as great filmmaking but simply a fun look back at high school in a unique time that only lasted a few years. For young people that want to get a feel for the 70s, watch this film. Also see Fast Times at Ridgemont High and the first two seasons of That 70s Show. Freaking awesome, dude!

    That's the thing about movies, man, no matter how many times I watch them they stay the exact same. Alright, alright, alright, it's the beginning of summer for me so that can only mean one thing. I watched Dazed and Confused. The year is 1976 and it is the first day of summer. Seniors abuse freshman and then go party. This is the story of one wild and crazy night from many different perspectives. This was a classic and it is timeless. There is everything in this movie from stoners to nerds to jocks to normal people. You get a sense of what high school was like back in the day. The main characters are Pink, the senior quarterback, and Mitch the upcoming freshman. There a lot of other lovable characters like the creepy Matthew McConaughey , the big bully Ben Affleck, and everything in-between. Pink is pressured from coaches to sign a waiver for next year's season and he doesn't know what he wants to do. This is a subtle problem that carries throughout the entire movie, which adds a spice to the movie. Mitch struggles with the annual beating from the seniors but soon comes to his own and finds out what high school is all about. The high school atmosphere in the 70s was incredible, I almost wish I was 18 back then. The stuff these kids got away with. The way they acted in school on the last day with the smoking weed outside and throwing papers everywhere. The group of guys is driving and take trash barrels and destroy mail boxes. Something like that would never happen today. The most disturbing scene was the hazing of the freshman girls. They poured ketchup and mustard on them and made them all gross. Hazing is a terrible thing but at least the movie made it funny. It is weird how they can abuse them one second and then a few hours later they are parrying with the girls they abused. The 70s was a weird decade. The 70s was a messed up decade but it did have killer music. Every scene had a perfect editing of music. Everything from Zeppelin to Ozzy to Kansas. The school bell rings and Alice Cooper's Schools Out blares and it was picture perfect. Music makes a movie, I say it all the time, music makes the movie, and the music made this movie. There was no original score, which is a little strange, but I knew every song they played and I love that kind of music so it made me very happy. My favorite character was the biggest stoner I have ever seen on the big screen. I forget his name but he has the long hair and the backwards cap and he is high in very scene. He speaks complete nonsense about the founding fathers and the cosmos and it is hilarious. It is between him and the Jewish guy from Saving Private Ryan. He plays a nerd who rambles on and on. Sometimes he makes sense and sometimes you just want him to shut up. His character has a lot of development and his group of friends is entertaining. So let's break this movie down. The plot is fantastic, the scenes themselves are well put together and there is really no boring part. There are a lot of characters so it can be a little difficult to follow but all are unique and mesh together perfectly. The acting wasn't remarkable but for the purpose of the movie it worked. The movie isn't really about the story or the deep emotions of the characters. It is strictly about the crazy antics of high school seniors. It is a night we all wish we could have. There are a few reality checks and unbelievable moments but overall a lot of fun. There isn't really much more that can be said about this movie other than it is a movie you need to see if you haven't. Overall, Dazed and Confused is timeless fun that can be enjoyed by anyone. It shows the ease of summer and in a way defined a decade. The music was great, the story was good enough, the acting was fine, it was funny, touching, and a lot of fun. I love this movie and I can see it anywhere, anytime. This is a great movie to see with friends, it is probably better with friends and is also a good background movie at party of something. I suggest you don't look into this movie too much but rather enjoy it for what it is, mindless fun. Dazed and Confused gets the WillyT Honorable Mention., so go watch it and enjoy and remember the days of drinking as a kid.

    There's really no story but it's not necessary for this flick; it's more of a hang-out movie. The movie brings you to the last day of school and summer is just around the corner. You get to see teens having fun, drinking beer and smoking pot. This is a time machine for everyone that was a teen in the 70's. The movie has a great soundtrack that I enjoyed to the fullest, especially when they end the movie with Slater sitting in the backseat of a Chevelle blowing out marijuana smoke while the Chevelle drives towards the horizon with Foghat's Slow Ride playing in the background. It's a really cool movie and I think every teen should watch it at least once in their lifetime. I give it a 10 because it's a great movie and I can relate so much to it.

    After watching Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise, Sunset I was moved and looked up his other movies and this title caught my attention. I got it and saw it recently. The plot is one which we all can connect with, which is the last day of school (probably not the part where all the drinking and smoking, getting wasted, laid happens). The craziness, rawness, carelessness of youth at that point of time is displayed on screen with much clarity. The dialogs are well written. The characters are all unique and have all performed well. We can connect to each of the character in the movie. Some are nerds, discussing deep, philosophical matters, theories, etc, who are decent and less violent as compared to the other groups. Some are violent, rash, rude and have all those character traits of a person, our parents warn us to stay away from. They make a joke of authority, care least about their own future and get involved in drugs, smoking, drinking etc. There's a line by a character in the movie which goes something on the lines of "if life's so short then we should enjoy it to the maximum while we are alive". Some kids take it too seriously and ruin their lives. I almost felt like talking to these kids and telling them its not the way of life, and that they are wasting their lives' best days. But then they would scoff at any such idea which stops them from enjoying. Some parts are very funny. Whenever Slater comes on screen, its hilarious. And there are parts where we can see how vulnerable some of the characters are to find someone to fall in love with. There is some great sound tracks running in the background which sets the mood for the 70's. Some great dialogs too. There is no conclusion shown but that bitter-sweet period is captured brilliantly. I rate it 7/10.

    All I knew about this film was that it was a pot smoking, 1970's-set film starring Matthew McConaughey. After finally seeing the nearly 20-year old film, I was virtually left Dazed and Confused on the only other "fact" I knew about it: this was supposed to be a comedy. This movie NEVER made me laugh. I will admit it did have me snickering a few times, namely a pregnant woman who was simultaneously smoking and being lectured on the healthy habits of calcium and another girl getting her tight jean's zipper up with pliers. Other than that, I found absolutely nothing funny about the lame story of horny and disorderly punks leaving their junior year of high school and entering summer, all in one night. Allow me to back track, I'm guessing some of this is about Juniors in High School, and some about Seniors. My suspicion was that this was SUPPOSED to be about seniors, as some of the graffiti and Junior High Abuse indicated, but the majority were being coached on their final year in High School and their football careers. So, I guess this was about all ages  Junior High to Freshmen to Juniors in High School to Seniors to Already Graduated Losers. Was that the intention of the writers? Not sure, but I am sure, I only saw this as a drama about a bunch of unruly, irresponsible adolescences who spend one night in May drinking, pot-smoking, complaining and destroying lives and property for the sole purpose ofnothing. So much so, there was a great quote two-thirds in and I love it when a character sums up the movie in the dialogue: "Fairly uneventful, huh?" Yep, that defines the movie. Heck, despite the clich&eacute;s, the movie was pumping for a "raging" or "epic" party, but was shut down by one kid's mistakes, so the "graduating" kids simply drive around for the rest of the film, destroying anything or anyone in their path. Okay, fine, they do make it to one minor field party, but that was about one-one-thousandths of the "Woodstock" I'm sure it was trying to imitate. Going back to my original take on this, prior to my first (and only) viewing of Dazed and Confused, I thought Matthew McConaughey was supposed to be in this. Well, he was. Kind of. You just have to wait until half the movie was over and even then, he's such an extremely minor backdrop, he barely matters. In fact, no one really matters here. The film just follows these uninteresting teens through the course of one night of debauchery. Booooooring. If this really happened to me, and I was their age in 1976 (I had just turned two at the time), I would say the same thing then: This is boring. And apparently, I'm not alone: these characters feel the same way. Maybe, that was the point. Maybe they just wanted to show us the average night of no-nothings with no futures. Fine. If that's the point, I'll just watch You-Tube. To fans of this movie, please send me a note to explain what I am missing. I think I pretty much summed it up by saying this was about nothing. At least when Seinfeld made a career of that, he made it funny.

    Dazed & Confused is my favourite film of all time. I have no idea how many times I've seen it, but every watch is as enjoyable as the last. I was born five months after the seventies finished, in the UK. So as far as the social realism of the movie goes, I cannot comment. However in a very broad sense there are two things which make me love this film so very much. Firstly, it's just so damn cool. The cars look amazing, the soundtrack is great, the clothes are effortlessly hip and the male and female leads (or as close is this film gets to leads) are the two people you would have loved to know at High School, regardless of the social circle you were in. It is incredibly quotable and although not obviously funny (it was poorly marketed as a comedy), these days different scenes crack me up every time I watch it. It is also NOT a stoner flick. Yes there's a fair bit of pot smoked in it, but only because there was a fair bit of pot smoked at that time. Not a single scene has pot smoking as its focus  it's just there, like the music, the clothes or the high school football stadium. Secondly and more importantly, it is a far more subtle and realistic examination of high school life than just about anything else I've seen (The Last Picture Show comes close in its depiction during the 1950s). Yes there are "jocks", "cheerleaders" and "geeks", but they are not so rigid in their definition. They are all interlinked by people who have friends in many camps. They all have their flaws but like the vast majority of teenagers, almost all of them are generally good kids (bar one whose redeeming scene was cut). Even though it's the last day of school, Linklater doesn't focus on the obvious graduating seniors. Rather on next year's seniors and next year's freshmen. This is not a huge day in their lives and nothing life changing is going to happen. The year's big party gets busted before it even starts and they spend most of the night just driving around or at the local pool hall. Perhaps the most astounding thing is the sheer number of characters that RL fits in to the film. There is not one conversation which I would label as clich&eacute;d or forced to inform you of character, yet I have counted 22 main roles and by the end of the film you feel you really know all of them. I could go on to write an essay about why this film is so fine, but let me just finally say this. There's no defined plot, there's no first, second and third act as such and there are certainly no great resolutions (because how many resolutions to life's problems do you really encounter when you're a teenager?). However there are cool conversations, fun times, obstructive parents and awesome Foosball!!
