 <sinopse>
  An ingenue insinuates herself in to the company of an established but aging stage actress and her circle of theater friends.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Aspiring actress Eve Harrington maneuvers her way into the lives of Broadway star Margo Channing, playwright Lloyd Richards and director Bill Sampson. This classic story of ambition and betrayal has become part of American folklore. Bette Davis claims to have based her character on the persona of film actress Talullah Bankhead. Davis' line "Fasten your seatbelts, it's going to be a bumpy night" is legendary, but, in fact, all of the film's dialog sparkles with equal brilliance.

    Actors are only as good as the material they must memorize, and here, that material is a combination of silk, satin and only the finest of cotton. Certainly, female leads Bette Davis and Anne Baxter are the epitome of perfection, and dominate everybody around them. Their fellow actors have nothing to gripe about either, hence a total of five acting Oscar Nominations. Every detail in this movie is picture perfect, even if the obvious backdrop of New Haven in one sequence is clearly stock footage and the final sequence drawn out to be a tad long. Davis, in arguably her finest film, is obviously emulating Tallulah Bankhead (no matter whom the original story was based upon), and it is fascinating to watch her go from bitch to saint, as well as the titled Eve (Anne Baxter) go from saint to bitch. Davis's Margo Channing is an extremely complex character, perhaps not as drag-queenish as Tallulah could be, and you will find yourself sympathizing with her as she reaches that difficult age of 40, which she expands on realistically through several philosophical monologues in which she reals the truth about who she really is underneath all the glitz and glamor of Broadway. Underneath all of that sardonic humor is what even Eve describes her to be as a truly great woman. Starting off like a drenched urchin, Baxter makes you pity her, but soon you see where her ambition really lies and how she intends to utilize, throw out and possibly destroy the others around her. But along comes the wait-and-see lion type character played by George Sanders and you know her fall will be swift and destructive, and no matter what happens in her rising career, her true character will end up being exposed for the manipulative passive/aggressive cat she really is. Celeste Holm has the hardest job, making you like her Melanie Wilkes like character without being annoyed by her excessive sweetness. You can see initially why she's fooled by Baxter, and in watching her grow a few claws in the film's second half, you really root for her to aid in Eve's soulful destruction. Thelma Ritter turns a hamburger helper part into steak simply by just being Thelma Ritter. Marilyn Monroe adds sly sensuality to a typical sexpot who happens to have a bit of hidden smarts in that bubble head of hers. It is obvious that there is something very special in her, and it is nice to see her working with Davis, equally as exciting as it was to see her with Barbara Stanwyck a few years later in "Clash By Night". Speaking of Stanwyck, there's a very funny reference by cub reporter Barbara Bates in the final scene referring to her and Susan Hayward as actresses from Brooklyn, but "they're only movie stars", a reference which reflects the snobbery of Broadway towards movie people. Then men in this film besides the bitchy Sanders (who deservedly won his Oscar) are less showy but they go out of their way to do more than just be a masculine presence on the arms of these colorful females. This could have given the film a camp presence, and it certainly does have that, but there is also a thought-provoking intelligence to it that is mesmerizing. Directing his own script (just as he did the previous year with "A Letter to Three Wives" for which he also took home two Oscars), Joseph Mankiewicz instills much unique detail into every segment that the film is truly unforgettable. Delightfully bitchy dialog that has gone down into the screenplay hall of frame is surrounded by some lesser known unknown gems and even in those sequences (such as one where Davis and group all bite viciously into a stalk of celery as a response to Sanders and Baxter's presence at a table near theirs), and everything comes up roses for everybody. You'll cheer for Margo Channing as she learns a major lesson from Eve's scheming, responding in a way that truly makes her a much better person.

    If ever there was (is or will be) a film destined to have critics grovel over it, it's a film where a critic is the smartest man in the room and who gets the hot chicks. It's also appealing to all reporters/journalists in that sense. Another artistic technicality well played for an otherwise dull soap opera. It's apropos that the film itself is cynical and paranoid and promotes such a view of the world. It does manage to be an inside, self promotional, look at both Hollywood and theater and its vicious recursive circle of stardom. An early look at the transition from plays/theater to Hollywood and the desire even in the late 1940s to be a movie star. Not much else. It doesn't age well. It's more like a look at what life turned out to be during the 1950s. Like The Third Man (1949), it's composed of artistic/intellectual clever tricks (including ways around censorship) to hide a tedious story of self referential self importance. If anything, this post-war soap opera of seriousness where none is deserved is a reflection of one of the main failings of a film industry at the time that missed the full potential of a real life Betty Boop in Marilyn Monroe. Painfully uninventive like a typical critic.

    I've heard about this film for years, but only now, the same night I'm watching my first Bette Davis film and having a marathon, am I able to properly experience it. Again, it's such an iconic film and you can pretty much know how the whole thing will work out (but again, the opening scene does make it clear as well if one is paying attention). Davis' performance is considered among the best ever, and it's very deserved. But Anne Baxter is also pretty amazing, and she plays the two sides we see of Eve perfectly, revealing her character more and more as the film goes along until we see her for the monster she is. But it's still very much a theme that is present in our times now.

    All about Eve is a 1950. movie directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, starring Bette Davis, Anne Baxter and George Sanders. The first scene in the movie is at a award ceremony regarding the theater. The most prestigious award (the Sarah Siddons Award for Distinguished Achievement) goes to non other than Eve Harrington, the brightest star of the theater, the golden girl like critic Addison Dewitt calls her (one of the narrators). According to Addison, we (public) know all about Eve and before the story really begins, we see Eve Harrington collecting her award and the movie freezes just at that most glorious moment of her life, the highest point of her young career. And later, once we meet Eve, the director takes us back to that moment. Who is Eve Harrington?! She is a lovely, innocent, sensitive, honest, understanding, warm young girl who is in deep love with the theater and crazy about her acting hero Margo Channing, the born star of the theater, a temperament, sometimes harsh woman capable of fighting through life. Eve meets Margo, becomes her assistant and little by little invades her life in a sweet way. Suddenly everyone becomes fond of Eve and Margo who is going through a midlife crises starts feeling the threat of innocent, young Eve. Margo is insecure, jealous, oversensitive and starts driving her friends away by her behavior while Eve is slowly taking her place, in her circle of friends and in the theater. Margo is falling and Eve is rising... I don't want to spoil the film for you so I'm going to stop but I will warn you that there is a great turn in the movie which I absolutely loved. Bette Davis as Margo and Anne Baxter as Eve were both stunning, I loved them. The bought me with their acting and contributed greatly to the movie's overall effect. Other supporting actors were great also, especially George Sanders as the cynical critic Addison Dewitt. He is the only one who won the Oscar. The dramatic plot is great, the editing also. The dialog is precise and intelligent. I have only words of praise for this movie. I loved it. The twist and the turn, the victims and the victimizers. I really tried not to spoil this movie for you, Eve is really a incredible character, unique and Addison Dewitt puts it very got at the end: "there never was and never will be another one like you". See for yourself...

    Right off of the start one thing becomes apparent: my opinion of Sunset Blvd. is critical to how much I'd like this film. Fortunately, I love Sunset Blvd, so much in fact that I gave it one out of eleven "ten's". However, the similar topics forces a comparison, and seeing Sunset Blvd first leads to a natural bias, leaning towards that film. I truly enjoyed All About Eve, and if you see it first, you may think different than me, numerically. Like Mad Men, which gets an apparent creative boost from being about creative folk, All About Eve is a film about entertainment by entertainers. Which, as the trend goes for such occasions, makes it incredible. The story is rich, with many little things that can't be pinpointed. But on a larger scale, everything is enjoyable. The actor's performances are mesmerizing; Davis' aging, displaced star is wonderfully upsetting and relateable. Sanders' deWitt is slimy but charming, with such a confident voice. But it's all about Eve. As Chris Rock would say, "you're goddamned disgusting!" And she is, oh, so wretched. Even in her first scene, the false humility and gratefulness leaks through her facade, and the cracks grow from there. By the end though it comes full circle, with a bitterly poetic conclusion. Eve's speech, and the glances the camera takes at the crowd, speak volumes about her character and the film's themes. Another point of note is how sharp the dialogue is. Being about theatre, many references get tossed around, of which I caught about 2: Macbeth and Hamlet. But all of the conversations have weight and wordplay that would make Shakespeare himself smile. All About Eve, despite being over 60 years old, is remarkably fresh. To start, this is probably the only film I've seen all year in which death is not a plot point. Also, in a medium which can be seen as male- dominated (there are 6 films higher than this on the Top 250 principally starring women), seeing female drama is unique. This story of deceit, undermining, fame and fakes is well- directed, well- acted, and enjoyable. Love the film, hate Eve. 9.0/10

    I saw this film on DVD recently and was stunned at the quality of every aspect - the scripting, direction and characters were all of a compelling wonderful quality and I couldn't see a single reason not to give it a 10/10 rating. It is dramatic, sharp, funny and thought provoking in a way that puts most modern films to shame Bette Davis is awesome and every young actress should watch her performance as an absolute masterclass. I'm disappointed with myself that I had never before made the effort to watch it and strongly recommend it.

    When Margot Channing, a big Broadway star, meets her biggest admirer, who calls herself Eve Harrington, she takes her in her home to help her and work with her. When Eve becomes Margot's understudy in a show, and obtains the part, jealousies start pouring out. Soon, Eve Harrington won't be the same, shy and humble person as she was before. It's a legendary Hollywood film not only because it broke the record of most Academy Award nominations (14), but because of its extremely witty, well-written dialogue, and because of the performances of Bette Davis, George Sanders, Anne Baxter, Hugh Marlowe, that make the film a tour-de-force of acting. Director Joseph Mankiewicz takes the advantage to also squeeze in a solemn hymn to theater, and at the same time, criticizing the ever-so-manipulating media always surrounding it; then, a detailed look at the actors and actresses' life, their rise and fall; by the end of the film, it is obvious that success in entertainment is dominated by a never-ending cycle pattern that connects one actor after the other, a pattern these kind of people must be part of, when trying to succeed. Six statuettes won at the Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Supporting Actor (George Sanders).

    Winner, Best Picture, 1951. An aspiring actress Eve, deceives an established and respected actress Margo with her charade. Margo gets impressed by her hundred percent attendance for all her shows and takes her as a personal assistant but Eve slowly gains the favor of the men involved in making the play and all of Margo's associates which ultimately results in her dethroning as the actress of the year. And as she decides to set foot in the Hollywood after she has received accolades for her brilliant performance, a stranger prepares to take the same position she took at Margo- a personal secretary. So the movie concludes with the phrase 'what goes around comes around'. Bette Davis is probably comparable only to Katharine Hepburn and has shown it once again why she is still called the First Lady of Cinema.

    The film is a rarity in that it was praised at its release, and has never critically waned. That, however is not the rarity I refer to; the rarity is that the film is deserving of the praise. It won many awards at many festivals, and was nominated for fourteen Oscars- a record tied only by the abysmal Titanic, in 1997- a film that represents an almost polar extreme from this film, in that it was all glitz and special effects, and had a terrible screenplay- one that dates Titanic, made almost a half century later, far more than All About Eve. This film garnered six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director (for Mankiewicz), Best Screenplay (for Mankiewicz) and Best Supporting Actor (for Sanders). Yet, despite all that, and my admiration for Mankiewicz's great writing, All About Eve is not a flat-out great film. It's close, a near-great, but the fact is that, for all of its stellar writing, it simply is not a deep film. In a sense, it recapitulates the shallow values all its lead characters embrace, in varying degrees. That, along with its rather pedestrian cinematography by Milton Krasner, as well as bad rear projection, in a scene of Eve and Addison walking in New Haven (even if its minimal soundtrack, by Alfred Newman, is commendable), are just enough to keep the film out of the pantheon of all time greats. Despite that, All About Eve is a great way to spend a few hours, and a shining example of classic Hollywood at its best (nearly).

    I'm a Christian and I give this a '9' I had read comments about the quality of the writing in this film but I really had no idea to what extent this would elevate the experience. The fact is, it leaves me with no other choice than to give it a perfect 10. Unless you see this film, I don't think you'll have the necessary frame of reference with which to to base any expectations on. It's an incredibly engrossing, moving and often comedic experience, but time and time again what knocks you over is the absolute finesse with which this script was crafted. The fact that the acting and direction are flawless and surprisingly natural-seeming (most old movies usually seem stiff or people seem to "act" too much) only enhances it that much more. With this film, you can really imagine the *people* the actors are portraying. "All About Eve" shows some similarity to one of my other favourite 50s films "A Face in the Crowd". Both are studies of fame and celebrity. Eve shows how a person will corrupt themselves in order to attain it, whereas A Face's premise is that fame corrupts those who find themselves in the spotlight. Both have themes that are perhaps even more resonant in our celebrity-obsessed culture now than when they were made. Interestingly, Eve predates A Face by several years. And possibly most interesting of all is the honest and often raw way in which women are portrayed, the strength of their character and the power they wield. The male contingent is practically relegated to the back seat. One might be hard pressed to find a movie quite so "liberated" today. So what more can I say? If you love movies and you haven't yet seen it, you've suffered long enough; don't wait another day.

    I saw this film on DVD recently and was stunned at the quality of every aspect - the scripting, direction and characters were all of a compelling wonderful quality and I couldn't see a single reason not to give it a 10/10 rating. It is dramatic, sharp, funny and thought provoking in a way that puts most modern films to shame Bette Davis is awesome and every young actress should watch her performance as an absolute masterclass. I'm disappointed with myself that I had never before made the effort to watch it and strongly recommend it.

    When Margot Channing, a big Broadway star, meets her biggest admirer, who calls herself Eve Harrington, she takes her in her home to help her and work with her. When Eve becomes Margot's understudy in a show, and obtains the part, jealousies start pouring out. Soon, Eve Harrington won't be the same, shy and humble person as she was before. It's a legendary Hollywood film not only because it broke the record of most Academy Award nominations (14), but because of its extremely witty, well-written dialogue, and because of the performances of Bette Davis, George Sanders, Anne Baxter, Hugh Marlowe, that make the film a tour-de-force of acting. Director Joseph Mankiewicz takes the advantage to also squeeze in a solemn hymn to theater, and at the same time, criticizing the ever-so-manipulating media always surrounding it; then, a detailed look at the actors and actresses' life, their rise and fall; by the end of the film, it is obvious that success in entertainment is dominated by a never-ending cycle pattern that connects one actor after the other, a pattern these kind of people must be part of, when trying to succeed. Six statuettes won at the Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Supporting Actor (George Sanders).

    Winner, Best Picture, 1951. An aspiring actress Eve, deceives an established and respected actress Margo with her charade. Margo gets impressed by her hundred percent attendance for all her shows and takes her as a personal assistant but Eve slowly gains the favor of the men involved in making the play and all of Margo's associates which ultimately results in her dethroning as the actress of the year. And as she decides to set foot in the Hollywood after she has received accolades for her brilliant performance, a stranger prepares to take the same position she took at Margo- a personal secretary. So the movie concludes with the phrase 'what goes around comes around'. Bette Davis is probably comparable only to Katharine Hepburn and has shown it once again why she is still called the First Lady of Cinema.

    The film is a rarity in that it was praised at its release, and has never critically waned. That, however is not the rarity I refer to; the rarity is that the film is deserving of the praise. It won many awards at many festivals, and was nominated for fourteen Oscars- a record tied only by the abysmal Titanic, in 1997- a film that represents an almost polar extreme from this film, in that it was all glitz and special effects, and had a terrible screenplay- one that dates Titanic, made almost a half century later, far more than All About Eve. This film garnered six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director (for Mankiewicz), Best Screenplay (for Mankiewicz) and Best Supporting Actor (for Sanders). Yet, despite all that, and my admiration for Mankiewicz's great writing, All About Eve is not a flat-out great film. It's close, a near-great, but the fact is that, for all of its stellar writing, it simply is not a deep film. In a sense, it recapitulates the shallow values all its lead characters embrace, in varying degrees. That, along with its rather pedestrian cinematography by Milton Krasner, as well as bad rear projection, in a scene of Eve and Addison walking in New Haven (even if its minimal soundtrack, by Alfred Newman, is commendable), are just enough to keep the film out of the pantheon of all time greats. Despite that, All About Eve is a great way to spend a few hours, and a shining example of classic Hollywood at its best (nearly).

    I'm a Christian and I give this a '9' I had read comments about the quality of the writing in this film but I really had no idea to what extent this would elevate the experience. The fact is, it leaves me with no other choice than to give it a perfect 10. Unless you see this film, I don't think you'll have the necessary frame of reference with which to to base any expectations on. It's an incredibly engrossing, moving and often comedic experience, but time and time again what knocks you over is the absolute finesse with which this script was crafted. The fact that the acting and direction are flawless and surprisingly natural-seeming (most old movies usually seem stiff or people seem to "act" too much) only enhances it that much more. With this film, you can really imagine the *people* the actors are portraying. "All About Eve" shows some similarity to one of my other favourite 50s films "A Face in the Crowd". Both are studies of fame and celebrity. Eve shows how a person will corrupt themselves in order to attain it, whereas A Face's premise is that fame corrupts those who find themselves in the spotlight. Both have themes that are perhaps even more resonant in our celebrity-obsessed culture now than when they were made. Interestingly, Eve predates A Face by several years. And possibly most interesting of all is the honest and often raw way in which women are portrayed, the strength of their character and the power they wield. The male contingent is practically relegated to the back seat. One might be hard pressed to find a movie quite so "liberated" today. So what more can I say? If you love movies and you haven't yet seen it, you've suffered long enough; don't wait another day.

    Actors are only as good as the material they must memorize, and here, that material is a combination of silk, satin and only the finest of cotton. Certainly, female leads Bette Davis and Anne Baxter are the epitome of perfection, and dominate everybody around them. Their fellow actors have nothing to gripe about either, hence a total of five acting Oscar Nominations. Every detail in this movie is picture perfect, even if the obvious backdrop of New Haven in one sequence is clearly stock footage and the final sequence drawn out to be a tad long. Davis, in arguably her finest film, is obviously emulating Tallulah Bankhead (no matter whom the original story was based upon), and it is fascinating to watch her go from bitch to saint, as well as the titled Eve (Anne Baxter) go from saint to bitch. Davis's Margo Channing is an extremely complex character, perhaps not as drag-queenish as Tallulah could be, and you will find yourself sympathizing with her as she reaches that difficult age of 40, which she expands on realistically through several philosophical monologues in which she reals the truth about who she really is underneath all the glitz and glamor of Broadway. Underneath all of that sardonic humor is what even Eve describes her to be as a truly great woman. Starting off like a drenched urchin, Baxter makes you pity her, but soon you see where her ambition really lies and how she intends to utilize, throw out and possibly destroy the others around her. But along comes the wait-and-see lion type character played by George Sanders and you know her fall will be swift and destructive, and no matter what happens in her rising career, her true character will end up being exposed for the manipulative passive/aggressive cat she really is. Celeste Holm has the hardest job, making you like her Melanie Wilkes like character without being annoyed by her excessive sweetness. You can see initially why she's fooled by Baxter, and in watching her grow a few claws in the film's second half, you really root for her to aid in Eve's soulful destruction. Thelma Ritter turns a hamburger helper part into steak simply by just being Thelma Ritter. Marilyn Monroe adds sly sensuality to a typical sexpot who happens to have a bit of hidden smarts in that bubble head of hers. It is obvious that there is something very special in her, and it is nice to see her working with Davis, equally as exciting as it was to see her with Barbara Stanwyck a few years later in "Clash By Night". Speaking of Stanwyck, there's a very funny reference by cub reporter Barbara Bates in the final scene referring to her and Susan Hayward as actresses from Brooklyn, but "they're only movie stars", a reference which reflects the snobbery of Broadway towards movie people. Then men in this film besides the bitchy Sanders (who deservedly won his Oscar) are less showy but they go out of their way to do more than just be a masculine presence on the arms of these colorful females. This could have given the film a camp presence, and it certainly does have that, but there is also a thought-provoking intelligence to it that is mesmerizing. Directing his own script (just as he did the previous year with "A Letter to Three Wives" for which he also took home two Oscars), Joseph Mankiewicz instills much unique detail into every segment that the film is truly unforgettable. Delightfully bitchy dialog that has gone down into the screenplay hall of frame is surrounded by some lesser known unknown gems and even in those sequences (such as one where Davis and group all bite viciously into a stalk of celery as a response to Sanders and Baxter's presence at a table near theirs), and everything comes up roses for everybody. You'll cheer for Margo Channing as she learns a major lesson from Eve's scheming, responding in a way that truly makes her a much better person.

    If ever there was (is or will be) a film destined to have critics grovel over it, it's a film where a critic is the smartest man in the room and who gets the hot chicks. It's also appealing to all reporters/journalists in that sense. Another artistic technicality well played for an otherwise dull soap opera. It's apropos that the film itself is cynical and paranoid and promotes such a view of the world. It does manage to be an inside, self promotional, look at both Hollywood and theater and its vicious recursive circle of stardom. An early look at the transition from plays/theater to Hollywood and the desire even in the late 1940s to be a movie star. Not much else. It doesn't age well. It's more like a look at what life turned out to be during the 1950s. Like The Third Man (1949), it's composed of artistic/intellectual clever tricks (including ways around censorship) to hide a tedious story of self referential self importance. If anything, this post-war soap opera of seriousness where none is deserved is a reflection of one of the main failings of a film industry at the time that missed the full potential of a real life Betty Boop in Marilyn Monroe. Painfully uninventive like a typical critic.

    I've heard about this film for years, but only now, the same night I'm watching my first Bette Davis film and having a marathon, am I able to properly experience it. Again, it's such an iconic film and you can pretty much know how the whole thing will work out (but again, the opening scene does make it clear as well if one is paying attention). Davis' performance is considered among the best ever, and it's very deserved. But Anne Baxter is also pretty amazing, and she plays the two sides we see of Eve perfectly, revealing her character more and more as the film goes along until we see her for the monster she is. But it's still very much a theme that is present in our times now.

    All about Eve is a 1950. movie directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, starring Bette Davis, Anne Baxter and George Sanders. The first scene in the movie is at a award ceremony regarding the theater. The most prestigious award (the Sarah Siddons Award for Distinguished Achievement) goes to non other than Eve Harrington, the brightest star of the theater, the golden girl like critic Addison Dewitt calls her (one of the narrators). According to Addison, we (public) know all about Eve and before the story really begins, we see Eve Harrington collecting her award and the movie freezes just at that most glorious moment of her life, the highest point of her young career. And later, once we meet Eve, the director takes us back to that moment. Who is Eve Harrington?! She is a lovely, innocent, sensitive, honest, understanding, warm young girl who is in deep love with the theater and crazy about her acting hero Margo Channing, the born star of the theater, a temperament, sometimes harsh woman capable of fighting through life. Eve meets Margo, becomes her assistant and little by little invades her life in a sweet way. Suddenly everyone becomes fond of Eve and Margo who is going through a midlife crises starts feeling the threat of innocent, young Eve. Margo is insecure, jealous, oversensitive and starts driving her friends away by her behavior while Eve is slowly taking her place, in her circle of friends and in the theater. Margo is falling and Eve is rising... I don't want to spoil the film for you so I'm going to stop but I will warn you that there is a great turn in the movie which I absolutely loved. Bette Davis as Margo and Anne Baxter as Eve were both stunning, I loved them. The bought me with their acting and contributed greatly to the movie's overall effect. Other supporting actors were great also, especially George Sanders as the cynical critic Addison Dewitt. He is the only one who won the Oscar. The dramatic plot is great, the editing also. The dialog is precise and intelligent. I have only words of praise for this movie. I loved it. The twist and the turn, the victims and the victimizers. I really tried not to spoil this movie for you, Eve is really a incredible character, unique and Addison Dewitt puts it very got at the end: "there never was and never will be another one like you". See for yourself...

    Right off of the start one thing becomes apparent: my opinion of Sunset Blvd. is critical to how much I'd like this film. Fortunately, I love Sunset Blvd, so much in fact that I gave it one out of eleven "ten's". However, the similar topics forces a comparison, and seeing Sunset Blvd first leads to a natural bias, leaning towards that film. I truly enjoyed All About Eve, and if you see it first, you may think different than me, numerically. Like Mad Men, which gets an apparent creative boost from being about creative folk, All About Eve is a film about entertainment by entertainers. Which, as the trend goes for such occasions, makes it incredible. The story is rich, with many little things that can't be pinpointed. But on a larger scale, everything is enjoyable. The actor's performances are mesmerizing; Davis' aging, displaced star is wonderfully upsetting and relateable. Sanders' deWitt is slimy but charming, with such a confident voice. But it's all about Eve. As Chris Rock would say, "you're goddamned disgusting!" And she is, oh, so wretched. Even in her first scene, the false humility and gratefulness leaks through her facade, and the cracks grow from there. By the end though it comes full circle, with a bitterly poetic conclusion. Eve's speech, and the glances the camera takes at the crowd, speak volumes about her character and the film's themes. Another point of note is how sharp the dialogue is. Being about theatre, many references get tossed around, of which I caught about 2: Macbeth and Hamlet. But all of the conversations have weight and wordplay that would make Shakespeare himself smile. All About Eve, despite being over 60 years old, is remarkably fresh. To start, this is probably the only film I've seen all year in which death is not a plot point. Also, in a medium which can be seen as male- dominated (there are 6 films higher than this on the Top 250 principally starring women), seeing female drama is unique. This story of deceit, undermining, fame and fakes is well- directed, well- acted, and enjoyable. Love the film, hate Eve. 9.0/10

    All about Eve is a 1950. movie directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, starring Bette Davis, Anne Baxter and George Sanders. The first scene in the movie is at a award ceremony regarding the theater. The most prestigious award (the Sarah Siddons Award for Distinguished Achievement) goes to non other than Eve Harrington, the brightest star of the theater, the golden girl like critic Addison Dewitt calls her (one of the narrators). According to Addison, we (public) know all about Eve and before the story really begins, we see Eve Harrington collecting her award and the movie freezes just at that most glorious moment of her life, the highest point of her young career. And later, once we meet Eve, the director takes us back to that moment. Who is Eve Harrington?! She is a lovely, innocent, sensitive, honest, understanding, warm young girl who is in deep love with the theater and crazy about her acting hero Margo Channing, the born star of the theater, a temperament, sometimes harsh woman capable of fighting through life. Eve meets Margo, becomes her assistant and little by little invades her life in a sweet way. Suddenly everyone becomes fond of Eve and Margo who is going through a midlife crises starts feeling the threat of innocent, young Eve. Margo is insecure, jealous, oversensitive and starts driving her friends away by her behavior while Eve is slowly taking her place, in her circle of friends and in the theater. Margo is falling and Eve is rising... I don't want to spoil the film for you so I'm going to stop but I will warn you that there is a great turn in the movie which I absolutely loved. Bette Davis as Margo and Anne Baxter as Eve were both stunning, I loved them. The bought me with their acting and contributed greatly to the movie's overall effect. Other supporting actors were great also, especially George Sanders as the cynical critic Addison Dewitt. He is the only one who won the Oscar. The dramatic plot is great, the editing also. The dialog is precise and intelligent. I have only words of praise for this movie. I loved it. The twist and the turn, the victims and the victimizers. I really tried not to spoil this movie for you, Eve is really a incredible character, unique and Addison Dewitt puts it very got at the end: "there never was and never will be another one like you". See for yourself...

    Right off of the start one thing becomes apparent: my opinion of Sunset Blvd. is critical to how much I'd like this film. Fortunately, I love Sunset Blvd, so much in fact that I gave it one out of eleven "ten's". However, the similar topics forces a comparison, and seeing Sunset Blvd first leads to a natural bias, leaning towards that film. I truly enjoyed All About Eve, and if you see it first, you may think different than me, numerically. Like Mad Men, which gets an apparent creative boost from being about creative folk, All About Eve is a film about entertainment by entertainers. Which, as the trend goes for such occasions, makes it incredible. The story is rich, with many little things that can't be pinpointed. But on a larger scale, everything is enjoyable. The actor's performances are mesmerizing; Davis' aging, displaced star is wonderfully upsetting and relateable. Sanders' deWitt is slimy but charming, with such a confident voice. But it's all about Eve. As Chris Rock would say, "you're goddamned disgusting!" And she is, oh, so wretched. Even in her first scene, the false humility and gratefulness leaks through her facade, and the cracks grow from there. By the end though it comes full circle, with a bitterly poetic conclusion. Eve's speech, and the glances the camera takes at the crowd, speak volumes about her character and the film's themes. Another point of note is how sharp the dialogue is. Being about theatre, many references get tossed around, of which I caught about 2: Macbeth and Hamlet. But all of the conversations have weight and wordplay that would make Shakespeare himself smile. All About Eve, despite being over 60 years old, is remarkably fresh. To start, this is probably the only film I've seen all year in which death is not a plot point. Also, in a medium which can be seen as male- dominated (there are 6 films higher than this on the Top 250 principally starring women), seeing female drama is unique. This story of deceit, undermining, fame and fakes is well- directed, well- acted, and enjoyable. Love the film, hate Eve. 9.0/10

    I saw this film on DVD recently and was stunned at the quality of every aspect - the scripting, direction and characters were all of a compelling wonderful quality and I couldn't see a single reason not to give it a 10/10 rating. It is dramatic, sharp, funny and thought provoking in a way that puts most modern films to shame Bette Davis is awesome and every young actress should watch her performance as an absolute masterclass. I'm disappointed with myself that I had never before made the effort to watch it and strongly recommend it.

    When Margot Channing, a big Broadway star, meets her biggest admirer, who calls herself Eve Harrington, she takes her in her home to help her and work with her. When Eve becomes Margot's understudy in a show, and obtains the part, jealousies start pouring out. Soon, Eve Harrington won't be the same, shy and humble person as she was before. It's a legendary Hollywood film not only because it broke the record of most Academy Award nominations (14), but because of its extremely witty, well-written dialogue, and because of the performances of Bette Davis, George Sanders, Anne Baxter, Hugh Marlowe, that make the film a tour-de-force of acting. Director Joseph Mankiewicz takes the advantage to also squeeze in a solemn hymn to theater, and at the same time, criticizing the ever-so-manipulating media always surrounding it; then, a detailed look at the actors and actresses' life, their rise and fall; by the end of the film, it is obvious that success in entertainment is dominated by a never-ending cycle pattern that connects one actor after the other, a pattern these kind of people must be part of, when trying to succeed. Six statuettes won at the Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Supporting Actor (George Sanders).

    Winner, Best Picture, 1951. An aspiring actress Eve, deceives an established and respected actress Margo with her charade. Margo gets impressed by her hundred percent attendance for all her shows and takes her as a personal assistant but Eve slowly gains the favor of the men involved in making the play and all of Margo's associates which ultimately results in her dethroning as the actress of the year. And as she decides to set foot in the Hollywood after she has received accolades for her brilliant performance, a stranger prepares to take the same position she took at Margo- a personal secretary. So the movie concludes with the phrase 'what goes around comes around'. Bette Davis is probably comparable only to Katharine Hepburn and has shown it once again why she is still called the First Lady of Cinema.

    The film is a rarity in that it was praised at its release, and has never critically waned. That, however is not the rarity I refer to; the rarity is that the film is deserving of the praise. It won many awards at many festivals, and was nominated for fourteen Oscars- a record tied only by the abysmal Titanic, in 1997- a film that represents an almost polar extreme from this film, in that it was all glitz and special effects, and had a terrible screenplay- one that dates Titanic, made almost a half century later, far more than All About Eve. This film garnered six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director (for Mankiewicz), Best Screenplay (for Mankiewicz) and Best Supporting Actor (for Sanders). Yet, despite all that, and my admiration for Mankiewicz's great writing, All About Eve is not a flat-out great film. It's close, a near-great, but the fact is that, for all of its stellar writing, it simply is not a deep film. In a sense, it recapitulates the shallow values all its lead characters embrace, in varying degrees. That, along with its rather pedestrian cinematography by Milton Krasner, as well as bad rear projection, in a scene of Eve and Addison walking in New Haven (even if its minimal soundtrack, by Alfred Newman, is commendable), are just enough to keep the film out of the pantheon of all time greats. Despite that, All About Eve is a great way to spend a few hours, and a shining example of classic Hollywood at its best (nearly).

    I'm a Christian and I give this a '9' I had read comments about the quality of the writing in this film but I really had no idea to what extent this would elevate the experience. The fact is, it leaves me with no other choice than to give it a perfect 10. Unless you see this film, I don't think you'll have the necessary frame of reference with which to to base any expectations on. It's an incredibly engrossing, moving and often comedic experience, but time and time again what knocks you over is the absolute finesse with which this script was crafted. The fact that the acting and direction are flawless and surprisingly natural-seeming (most old movies usually seem stiff or people seem to "act" too much) only enhances it that much more. With this film, you can really imagine the *people* the actors are portraying. "All About Eve" shows some similarity to one of my other favourite 50s films "A Face in the Crowd". Both are studies of fame and celebrity. Eve shows how a person will corrupt themselves in order to attain it, whereas A Face's premise is that fame corrupts those who find themselves in the spotlight. Both have themes that are perhaps even more resonant in our celebrity-obsessed culture now than when they were made. Interestingly, Eve predates A Face by several years. And possibly most interesting of all is the honest and often raw way in which women are portrayed, the strength of their character and the power they wield. The male contingent is practically relegated to the back seat. One might be hard pressed to find a movie quite so "liberated" today. So what more can I say? If you love movies and you haven't yet seen it, you've suffered long enough; don't wait another day.

    Actors are only as good as the material they must memorize, and here, that material is a combination of silk, satin and only the finest of cotton. Certainly, female leads Bette Davis and Anne Baxter are the epitome of perfection, and dominate everybody around them. Their fellow actors have nothing to gripe about either, hence a total of five acting Oscar Nominations. Every detail in this movie is picture perfect, even if the obvious backdrop of New Haven in one sequence is clearly stock footage and the final sequence drawn out to be a tad long. Davis, in arguably her finest film, is obviously emulating Tallulah Bankhead (no matter whom the original story was based upon), and it is fascinating to watch her go from bitch to saint, as well as the titled Eve (Anne Baxter) go from saint to bitch. Davis's Margo Channing is an extremely complex character, perhaps not as drag-queenish as Tallulah could be, and you will find yourself sympathizing with her as she reaches that difficult age of 40, which she expands on realistically through several philosophical monologues in which she reals the truth about who she really is underneath all the glitz and glamor of Broadway. Underneath all of that sardonic humor is what even Eve describes her to be as a truly great woman. Starting off like a drenched urchin, Baxter makes you pity her, but soon you see where her ambition really lies and how she intends to utilize, throw out and possibly destroy the others around her. But along comes the wait-and-see lion type character played by George Sanders and you know her fall will be swift and destructive, and no matter what happens in her rising career, her true character will end up being exposed for the manipulative passive/aggressive cat she really is. Celeste Holm has the hardest job, making you like her Melanie Wilkes like character without being annoyed by her excessive sweetness. You can see initially why she's fooled by Baxter, and in watching her grow a few claws in the film's second half, you really root for her to aid in Eve's soulful destruction. Thelma Ritter turns a hamburger helper part into steak simply by just being Thelma Ritter. Marilyn Monroe adds sly sensuality to a typical sexpot who happens to have a bit of hidden smarts in that bubble head of hers. It is obvious that there is something very special in her, and it is nice to see her working with Davis, equally as exciting as it was to see her with Barbara Stanwyck a few years later in "Clash By Night". Speaking of Stanwyck, there's a very funny reference by cub reporter Barbara Bates in the final scene referring to her and Susan Hayward as actresses from Brooklyn, but "they're only movie stars", a reference which reflects the snobbery of Broadway towards movie people. Then men in this film besides the bitchy Sanders (who deservedly won his Oscar) are less showy but they go out of their way to do more than just be a masculine presence on the arms of these colorful females. This could have given the film a camp presence, and it certainly does have that, but there is also a thought-provoking intelligence to it that is mesmerizing. Directing his own script (just as he did the previous year with "A Letter to Three Wives" for which he also took home two Oscars), Joseph Mankiewicz instills much unique detail into every segment that the film is truly unforgettable. Delightfully bitchy dialog that has gone down into the screenplay hall of frame is surrounded by some lesser known unknown gems and even in those sequences (such as one where Davis and group all bite viciously into a stalk of celery as a response to Sanders and Baxter's presence at a table near theirs), and everything comes up roses for everybody. You'll cheer for Margo Channing as she learns a major lesson from Eve's scheming, responding in a way that truly makes her a much better person.

    If ever there was (is or will be) a film destined to have critics grovel over it, it's a film where a critic is the smartest man in the room and who gets the hot chicks. It's also appealing to all reporters/journalists in that sense. Another artistic technicality well played for an otherwise dull soap opera. It's apropos that the film itself is cynical and paranoid and promotes such a view of the world. It does manage to be an inside, self promotional, look at both Hollywood and theater and its vicious recursive circle of stardom. An early look at the transition from plays/theater to Hollywood and the desire even in the late 1940s to be a movie star. Not much else. It doesn't age well. It's more like a look at what life turned out to be during the 1950s. Like The Third Man (1949), it's composed of artistic/intellectual clever tricks (including ways around censorship) to hide a tedious story of self referential self importance. If anything, this post-war soap opera of seriousness where none is deserved is a reflection of one of the main failings of a film industry at the time that missed the full potential of a real life Betty Boop in Marilyn Monroe. Painfully uninventive like a typical critic.

    I've heard about this film for years, but only now, the same night I'm watching my first Bette Davis film and having a marathon, am I able to properly experience it. Again, it's such an iconic film and you can pretty much know how the whole thing will work out (but again, the opening scene does make it clear as well if one is paying attention). Davis' performance is considered among the best ever, and it's very deserved. But Anne Baxter is also pretty amazing, and she plays the two sides we see of Eve perfectly, revealing her character more and more as the film goes along until we see her for the monster she is. But it's still very much a theme that is present in our times now.

You can see initially why she's fooled by Baxter, and in watching her grow a few claws in the film's second half, you really root for her to aid in Eve's soulful destruction. Thelma Ritter turns a hamburger helper part into steak simply by just being Thelma Ritter. Marilyn Monroe adds sly sensuality to a typical sexpot who happens to have a bit of hidden smarts in that bubble head of hers. It is obvious that there is something very special in her, and it is nice to see her working with Davis, equally as exciting as it was to see her with Barbara Stanwyck a few years later in "Clash By Night". Speaking of Stanwyck, there's a very funny reference by cub reporter Barbara Bates in the final scene referring to her and Susan Hayward as actresses from Brooklyn, but "they're only movie stars", a reference which reflects the snobbery of Broadway towards movie people. Then men in this film besides the bitchy Sanders (who deservedly won his Oscar) are less showy but they go out of their way to do more than just be a masculine presence on the arms of these colorful females. This could have given the film a camp presence, and it certainly does have that, but there is also a thought-provoking intelligence to it that is mesmerizing. Directing his own script (just as he did the previous year with "A Letter to Three Wives" for which he also took home two Oscars), Joseph Mankiewicz instills much unique detail into every segment that the film is truly unforgettable. Delightfully bitchy dialog that has gone down into the screenplay hall of frame is surrounded by some lesser known unknown gems and even in those sequences (such as one where Davis and group all bite viciously into a stalk of celery as a response to Sanders and Baxter's presence at a table near theirs), and everything comes up roses for everybody. You'll cheer for Margo Channing as she learns a major lesson from Eve's scheming, responding in a way that truly makes her a much better person.

    If ever there was (is or will be) a film destined to have critics grovel over it, it's a film where a critic is the smartest man in the room and who gets the hot chicks. It's also appealing to all reporters/journalists in that sense. Another artistic technicality well played for an otherwise dull soap opera. It's apropos that the film itself is cynical and paranoid and promotes such a view of the world. It does manage to be an inside, self promotional, look at both Hollywood and theater and its vicious recursive circle of stardom. An early look at the transition from plays/theater to Hollywood and the desire even in the late 1940s to be a movie star. Not much else. It doesn't age well. It's more like a look at what life turned out to be during the 1950s. Like The Third Man (1949), it's composed of artistic/intellectual clever tricks (including ways around censorship) to hide a tedious story of self referential self importance. If anything, this post-war soap opera of seriousness where none is deserved is a reflection of one of the main failings of a film industry at the time that missed the full potential of a real life Betty Boop in Marilyn Monroe. Painfully uninventive like a typical critic.

    I've heard about this film for years, but only now, the same night I'm watching my first Bette Davis film and having a marathon, am I able to properly experience it. Again, it's such an iconic film and you can pretty much know how the whole thing will work out (but again, the opening scene does make it clear as well if one is paying attention). Davis' performance is considered among the best ever, and it's very deserved. But Anne Baxter is also pretty amazing, and she plays the two sides we see of Eve perfectly, revealing her character more and more as the film goes along until we see her for the monster she is. But it's still very much a theme that is present in our times now.

    All about Eve is a 1950. movie directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, starring Bette Davis, Anne Baxter and George Sanders. The first scene in the movie is at a award ceremony regarding the theater. The most prestigious award (the Sarah Siddons Award for Distinguished Achievement) goes to non other than Eve Harrington, the brightest star of the theater, the golden girl like critic Addison Dewitt calls her (one of the narrators). According to Addison, we (public) know all about Eve and before the story really begins, we see Eve Harrington collecting her award and the movie freezes just at that most glorious moment of her life, the highest point of her young career. And later, once we meet Eve, the director takes us back to that moment. Who is Eve Harrington?! She is a lovely, innocent, sensitive, honest, understanding, warm young girl who is in deep love with the theater and crazy about her acting hero Margo Channing, the born star of the theater, a temperament, sometimes harsh woman capable of fighting through life. Eve meets Margo, becomes her assistant and little by little invades her life in a sweet way. Suddenly everyone becomes fond of Eve and Margo who is going through a midlife crises starts feeling the threat of innocent, young Eve. Margo is insecure, jealous, oversensitive and starts driving her friends away by her behavior while Eve is slowly taking her place, in her circle of friends and in the theater. Margo is falling and Eve is rising... I don't want to spoil the film for you so I'm going to stop but I will warn you that there is a great turn in the movie which I absolutely loved. Bette Davis as Margo and Anne Baxter as Eve were both stunning, I loved them. The bought me with their acting and contributed greatly to the movie's overall effect. Other supporting actors were great also, especially George Sanders as the cynical critic Addison Dewitt. He is the only one who won the Oscar. The dramatic plot is great, the editing also. The dialog is precise and intelligent. I have only words of praise for this movie. I loved it. The twist and the turn, the victims and the victimizers. I really tried not to spoil this movie for you, Eve is really a incredible character, unique and Addison Dewitt puts it very got at the end: "there never was and never will be another one like you". See for yourself...

    Right off of the start one thing becomes apparent: my opinion of Sunset Blvd. is critical to how much I'd like this film. Fortunately, I love Sunset Blvd, so much in fact that I gave it one out of eleven "ten's". However, the similar topics forces a comparison, and seeing Sunset Blvd first leads to a natural bias, leaning towards that film. I truly enjoyed All About Eve, and if you see it first, you may think different than me, numerically. Like Mad Men, which gets an apparent creative boost from being about creative folk, All About Eve is a film about entertainment by entertainers. Which, as the trend goes for such occasions, makes it incredible. The story is rich, with many little things that can't be pinpointed. But on a larger scale, everything is enjoyable. The actor's performances are mesmerizing; Davis' aging, displaced star is wonderfully upsetting and relateable. Sanders' deWitt is slimy but charming, with such a confident voice. But it's all about Eve. As Chris Rock would say, "you're goddamned disgusting!" And she is, oh, so wretched. Even in her first scene, the false humility and gratefulness leaks through her facade, and the cracks grow from there. By the end though it comes full circle, with a bitterly poetic conclusion. Eve's speech, and the glances the camera takes at the crowd, speak volumes about her character and the film's themes. Another point of note is how sharp the dialogue is. Being about theatre, many references get tossed around, of which I caught about 2: Macbeth and Hamlet. But all of the conversations have weight and wordplay that would make Shakespeare himself smile. All About Eve, despite being over 60 years old, is remarkably fresh. To start, this is probably the only film I've seen all year in which death is not a plot point. Also, in a medium which can be seen as male- dominated (there are 6 films higher than this on the Top 250 principally starring women), seeing female drama is unique. This story of deceit, undermining, fame and fakes is well- directed, well- acted, and enjoyable. Love the film, hate Eve. 9.0/10

    I saw this film on DVD recently and was stunned at the quality of every aspect - the scripting, direction and characters were all of a compelling wonderful quality and I couldn't see a single reason not to give it a 10/10 rating. It is dramatic, sharp, funny and thought provoking in a way that puts most modern films to shame Bette Davis is awesome and every young actress should watch her performance as an absolute masterclass. I'm disappointed with myself that I had never before made the effort to watch it and strongly recommend it.

    When Margot Channing, a big Broadway star, meets her biggest admirer, who calls herself Eve Harrington, she takes her in her home to help her and work with her. When Eve becomes Margot's understudy in a show, and obtains the part, jealousies start pouring out. Soon, Eve Harrington won't be the same, shy and humble person as she was before. It's a legendary Hollywood film not only because it broke the record of most Academy Award nominations (14), but because of its extremely witty, well-written dialogue, and because of the performances of Bette Davis, George Sanders, Anne Baxter, Hugh Marlowe, that make the film a tour-de-force of acting. Director Joseph Mankiewicz takes the advantage to also squeeze in a solemn hymn to theater, and at the same time, criticizing the ever-so-manipulating media always surrounding it; then, a detailed look at the actors and actresses' life, their rise and fall; by the end of the film, it is obvious that success in entertainment is dominated by a never-ending cycle pattern that connects one actor after the other, a pattern these kind of people must be part of, when trying to succeed. Six statuettes won at the Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Supporting Actor (George Sanders).

    Winner, Best Picture, 1951. An aspiring actress Eve, deceives an established and respected actress Margo with her charade. Margo gets impressed by her hundred percent attendance for all her shows and takes her as a personal assistant but Eve slowly gains the favor of the men involved in making the play and all of Margo's associates which ultimately results in her dethroning as the actress of the year. And as she decides to set foot in the Hollywood after she has received accolades for her brilliant performance, a stranger prepares to take the same position she took at Margo- a personal secretary. So the movie concludes with the phrase 'what goes around comes around'. Bette Davis is probably comparable only to Katharine Hepburn and has shown it once again why she is still called the First Lady of Cinema.

    The film is a rarity in that it was praised at its release, and has never critically waned. That, however is not the rarity I refer to; the rarity is that the film is deserving of the praise. It won many awards at many festivals, and was nominated for fourteen Oscars- a record tied only by the abysmal Titanic, in 1997- a film that represents an almost polar extreme from this film, in that it was all glitz and special effects, and had a terrible screenplay- one that dates Titanic, made almost a half century later, far more than All About Eve. This film garnered six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director (for Mankiewicz), Best Screenplay (for Mankiewicz) and Best Supporting Actor (for Sanders). Yet, despite all that, and my admiration for Mankiewicz's great writing, All About Eve is not a flat-out great film. It's close, a near-great, but the fact is that, for all of its stellar writing, it simply is not a deep film. In a sense, it recapitulates the shallow values all its lead characters embrace, in varying degrees. That, along with its rather pedestrian cinematography by Milton Krasner, as well as bad rear projection, in a scene of Eve and Addison walking in New Haven (even if its minimal soundtrack, by Alfred Newman, is commendable), are just enough to keep the film out of the pantheon of all time greats. Despite that, All About Eve is a great way to spend a few hours, and a shining example of classic Hollywood at its best (nearly).

    I'm a Christian and I give this a '9' I had read comments about the quality of the writing in this film but I really had no idea to what extent this would elevate the experience. The fact is, it leaves me with no other choice than to give it a perfect 10. Unless you see this film, I don't think you'll have the necessary frame of reference with which to to base any expectations on. It's an incredibly engrossing, moving and often comedic experience, but time and time again what knocks you over is the absolute finesse with which this script was crafted. The fact that the acting and direction are flawless and surprisingly natural-seeming (most old movies usually seem stiff or people seem to "act" too much) only enhances it that much more. With this film, you can really imagine the *people* the actors are portraying. "All About Eve" shows some similarity to one of my other favourite 50s films "A Face in the Crowd". Both are studies of fame and celebrity. Eve shows how a person will corrupt themselves in order to attain it, whereas A Face's premise is that fame corrupts those who find themselves in the spotlight. Both have themes that are perhaps even more resonant in our celebrity-obsessed culture now than when they were made. Interestingly, Eve predates A Face by several years. And possibly most interesting of all is the honest and often raw way in which women are portrayed, the strength of their character and the power they wield. The male contingent is practically relegated to the back seat. One might be hard pressed to find a movie quite so "liberated" today. So what more can I say? If you love movies and you haven't yet seen it, you've suffered long enough; don't wait another day.

    Actors are only as good as the material they must memorize, and here, that material is a combination of silk, satin and only the finest of cotton. Certainly, female leads Bette Davis and Anne Baxter are the epitome of perfection, and dominate everybody around them. Their fellow actors have nothing to gripe about either, hence a total of five acting Oscar Nominations. Every detail in this movie is picture perfect, even if the obvious backdrop of New Haven in one sequence is clearly stock footage and the final sequence drawn out to be a tad long. Davis, in arguably her finest film, is obviously emulating Tallulah Bankhead (no matter whom the original story was based upon), and it is fascinating to watch her go from bitch to saint, as well as the titled Eve (Anne Baxter) go from saint to bitch. Davis's Margo Channing is an extremely complex character, perhaps not as drag-queenish as Tallulah could be, and you will find yourself sympathizing with her as she reaches that difficult age of 40, which she expands on realistically through several philosophical monologues in which she reals the truth about who she really is underneath all the glitz and glamor of Broadway. Underneath all of that sardonic humor is what even Eve describes her to be as a truly great woman. Starting off like a drenched urchin, Baxter makes you pity her, but soon you see where her ambition really lies and how she intends to utilize, throw out and possibly destroy the others around her. But along comes the wait-and-see lion type character played by George Sanders and you know her fall will be swift and destructive, and no matter what happens in her rising career, her true character will end up being exposed for the manipulative passive/aggressive cat she really is. Celeste Holm has the hardest job, making you like her Melanie Wilkes like character without being annoyed by her excessive sweetness. You can see initially why she's fooled by Baxter, and in watching her grow a few claws in the film's second half, you really root for her to aid in Eve's soulful destruction. Thelma Ritter turns a hamburger helper part into steak simply by just being Thelma Ritter. Marilyn Monroe adds sly sensuality to a typical sexpot who happens to have a bit of hidden smarts in that bubble head of hers. It is obvious that there is something very special in her, and it is nice to see her working with Davis, equally as exciting as it was to see her with Barbara Stanwyck a few years later in "Clash By Night". Speaking of Stanwyck, there's a very funny reference by cub reporter Barbara Bates in the final scene referring to her and Susan Hayward as actresses from Brooklyn, but "they're only movie stars", a reference which reflects the snobbery of Broadway towards movie people.

You'll cheer for Margo Channing as she learns a major lesson from Eve's scheming, responding in a way that truly makes her a much better person.

It won many awards at many festivals, and was nominated for fourteen Oscars- a record tied only by the abysmal Titanic, in 1997- a film that represents an almost polar extreme from this film, in that it was all glitz and special effects, and had a terrible screenplay- one that dates Titanic, made almost a half century later, far more than All About Eve. This film garnered six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director (for Mankiewicz), Best Screenplay (for Mankiewicz) and Best Supporting Actor (for Sanders). Yet, despite all that, and my admiration for Mankiewicz's great writing, All About Eve is not a flat-out great film. It's close, a near-great, but the fact is that, for all of its stellar writing, it simply is not a deep film. In a sense, it recapitulates the shallow values all its lead characters embrace, in varying degrees. That, along with its rather pedestrian cinematography by Milton Krasner, as well as bad rear projection, in a scene of Eve and Addison walking in New Haven (even if its minimal soundtrack, by Alfred Newman, is commendable), are just enough to keep the film out of the pantheon of all time greats. Despite that, All About Eve is a great way to spend a few hours, and a shining example of classic Hollywood at its best (nearly).

    I'm a Christian and I give this a '9' I had read comments about the quality of the writing in this film but I really had no idea to what extent this would elevate the experience. The fact is, it leaves me with no other choice than to give it a perfect 10. Unless you see this film, I don't think you'll have the necessary frame of reference with which to to base any expectations on. It's an incredibly engrossing, moving and often comedic experience, but time and time again what knocks you over is the absolute finesse with which this script was crafted. The fact that the acting and direction are flawless and surprisingly natural-seeming (most old movies usually seem stiff or people seem to "act" too much) only enhances it that much more. With this film, you can really imagine the *people* the actors are portraying. "All About Eve" shows some similarity to one of my other favourite 50s films "A Face in the Crowd". Both are studies of fame and celebrity. Eve shows how a person will corrupt themselves in order to attain it, whereas A Face's premise is that fame corrupts those who find themselves in the spotlight. Both have themes that are perhaps even more resonant in our celebrity-obsessed culture now than when they were made. Interestingly, Eve predates A Face by several years. And possibly most interesting of all is the honest and often raw way in which women are portrayed, the strength of their character and the power they wield. The male contingent is practically relegated to the back seat. One might be hard pressed to find a movie quite so "liberated" today. So what more can I say? If you love movies and you haven't yet seen it, you've suffered long enough; don't wait another day.

    Actors are only as good as the material they must memorize, and here, that material is a combination of silk, satin and only the finest of cotton. Certainly, female leads Bette Davis and Anne Baxter are the epitome of perfection, and dominate everybody around them. Their fellow actors have nothing to gripe about either, hence a total of five acting Oscar Nominations. Every detail in this movie is picture perfect, even if the obvious backdrop of New Haven in one sequence is clearly stock footage and the final sequence drawn out to be a tad long. Davis, in arguably her finest film, is obviously emulating Tallulah Bankhead (no matter whom the original story was based upon), and it is fascinating to watch her go from bitch to saint, as well as the titled Eve (Anne Baxter) go from saint to bitch. Davis's Margo Channing is an extremely complex character, perhaps not as drag-queenish as Tallulah could be, and you will find yourself sympathizing with her as she reaches that difficult age of 40, which she expands on realistically through several philosophical monologues in which she reals the truth about who she really is underneath all the glitz and glamor of Broadway. Underneath all of that sardonic humor is what even Eve describes her to be as a truly great woman. Starting off like a drenched urchin, Baxter makes you pity her, but soon you see where her ambition really lies and how she intends to utilize, throw out and possibly destroy the others around her. But along comes the wait-and-see lion type character played by George Sanders and you know her fall will be swift and destructive, and no matter what happens in her rising career, her true character will end up being exposed for the manipulative passive/aggressive cat she really is. Celeste Holm has the hardest job, making you like her Melanie Wilkes like character without being annoyed by her excessive sweetness. You can see initially why she's fooled by Baxter, and in watching her grow a few claws in the film's second half, you really root for her to aid in Eve's soulful destruction. Thelma Ritter turns a hamburger helper part into steak simply by just being Thelma Ritter. Marilyn Monroe adds sly sensuality to a typical sexpot who happens to have a bit of hidden smarts in that bubble head of hers. It is obvious that there is something very special in her, and it is nice to see her working with Davis, equally as exciting as it was to see her with Barbara Stanwyck a few years later in "Clash By Night". Speaking of Stanwyck, there's a very funny reference by cub reporter Barbara Bates in the final scene referring to her and Susan Hayward as actresses from Brooklyn, but "they're only movie stars", a reference which reflects the snobbery of Broadway towards movie people. Then men in this film besides the bitchy Sanders (who deservedly won his Oscar) are less showy but they go out of their way to do more than just be a masculine presence on the arms of these colorful females. This could have given the film a camp presence, and it certainly does have that, but there is also a thought-provoking intelligence to it that is mesmerizing. Directing his own script (just as he did the previous year with "A Letter to Three Wives" for which he also took home two Oscars), Joseph Mankiewicz instills much unique detail into every segment that the film is truly unforgettable. Delightfully bitchy dialog that has gone down into the screenplay hall of frame is surrounded by some lesser known unknown gems and even in those sequences (such as one where Davis and group all bite viciously into a stalk of celery as a response to Sanders and Baxter's presence at a table near theirs), and everything comes up roses for everybody. You'll cheer for Margo Channing as she learns a major lesson from Eve's scheming, responding in a way that truly makes her a much better person.

    If ever there was (is or will be) a film destined to have critics grovel over it, it's a film where a critic is the smartest man in the room and who gets the hot chicks. It's also appealing to all reporters/journalists in that sense. Another artistic technicality well played for an otherwise dull soap opera. It's apropos that the film itself is cynical and paranoid and promotes such a view of the world. It does manage to be an inside, self promotional, look at both Hollywood and theater and its vicious recursive circle of stardom. An early look at the transition from plays/theater to Hollywood and the desire even in the late 1940s to be a movie star. Not much else. It doesn't age well. It's more like a look at what life turned out to be during the 1950s. Like The Third Man (1949), it's composed of artistic/intellectual clever tricks (including ways around censorship) to hide a tedious story of self referential self importance. If anything, this post-war soap opera of seriousness where none is deserved is a reflection of one of the main failings of a film industry at the time that missed the full potential of a real life Betty Boop in Marilyn Monroe. Painfully uninventive like a typical critic.

    I've heard about this film for years, but only now, the same night I'm watching my first Bette Davis film and having a marathon, am I able to properly experience it. Again, it's such an iconic film and you can pretty much know how the whole thing will work out (but again, the opening scene does make it clear as well if one is paying attention). Davis' performance is considered among the best ever, and it's very deserved. But Anne Baxter is also pretty amazing, and she plays the two sides we see of Eve perfectly, revealing her character more and more as the film goes along until we see her for the monster she is. But it's still very much a theme that is present in our times now.

    All about Eve is a 1950. movie directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, starring Bette Davis, Anne Baxter and George Sanders. The first scene in the movie is at a award ceremony regarding the theater. The most prestigious award (the Sarah Siddons Award for Distinguished Achievement) goes to non other than Eve Harrington, the brightest star of the theater, the golden girl like critic Addison Dewitt calls her (one of the narrators). According to Addison, we (public) know all about Eve and before the story really begins, we see Eve Harrington collecting her award and the movie freezes just at that most glorious moment of her life, the highest point of her young career. And later, once we meet Eve, the director takes us back to that moment. Who is Eve Harrington?! She is a lovely, innocent, sensitive, honest, understanding, warm young girl who is in deep love with the theater and crazy about her acting hero Margo Channing, the born star of the theater, a temperament, sometimes harsh woman capable of fighting through life. Eve meets Margo, becomes her assistant and little by little invades her life in a sweet way. Suddenly everyone becomes fond of Eve and Margo who is going through a midlife crises starts feeling the threat of innocent, young Eve. Margo is insecure, jealous, oversensitive and starts driving her friends away by her behavior while Eve is slowly taking her place, in her circle of friends and in the theater. Margo is falling and Eve is rising... I don't want to spoil the film for you so I'm going to stop but I will warn you that there is a great turn in the movie which I absolutely loved. Bette Davis as Margo and Anne Baxter as Eve were both stunning, I loved them. The bought me with their acting and contributed greatly to the movie's overall effect. Other supporting actors were great also, especially George Sanders as the cynical critic Addison Dewitt. He is the only one who won the Oscar. The dramatic plot is great, the editing also. The dialog is precise and intelligent. I have only words of praise for this movie. I loved it. The twist and the turn, the victims and the victimizers. I really tried not to spoil this movie for you, Eve is really a incredible character, unique and Addison Dewitt puts it very got at the end: "there never was and never will be another one like you". See for yourself...

    Right off of the start one thing becomes apparent: my opinion of Sunset Blvd. is critical to how much I'd like this film. Fortunately, I love Sunset Blvd, so much in fact that I gave it one out of eleven "ten's". However, the similar topics forces a comparison, and seeing Sunset Blvd first leads to a natural bias, leaning towards that film. I truly enjoyed All About Eve, and if you see it first, you may think different than me, numerically. Like Mad Men, which gets an apparent creative boost from being about creative folk, All About Eve is a film about entertainment by entertainers. Which, as the trend goes for such occasions, makes it incredible. The story is rich, with many little things that can't be pinpointed. But on a larger scale, everything is enjoyable. The actor's performances are mesmerizing; Davis' aging, displaced star is wonderfully upsetting and relateable. Sanders' deWitt is slimy but charming, with such a confident voice. But it's all about Eve. As Chris Rock would say, "you're goddamned disgusting!" And she is, oh, so wretched. Even in her first scene, the false humility and gratefulness leaks through her facade, and the cracks grow from there. By the end though it comes full circle, with a bitterly poetic conclusion. Eve's speech, and the glances the camera takes at the crowd, speak volumes about her character and the film's themes. Another point of note is how sharp the dialogue is. Being about theatre, many references get tossed around, of which I caught about 2: Macbeth and Hamlet. But all of the conversations have weight and wordplay that would make Shakespeare himself smile. All About Eve, despite being over 60 years old, is remarkably fresh. To start, this is probably the only film I've seen all year in which death is not a plot point. Also, in a medium which can be seen as male- dominated (there are 6 films higher than this on the Top 250 principally starring women), seeing female drama is unique. This story of deceit, undermining, fame and fakes is well- directed, well- acted, and enjoyable. Love the film, hate Eve. 9.0/10

    I saw this film on DVD recently and was stunned at the quality of every aspect - the scripting, direction and characters were all of a compelling wonderful quality and I couldn't see a single reason not to give it a 10/10 rating. It is dramatic, sharp, funny and thought provoking in a way that puts most modern films to shame Bette Davis is awesome and every young actress should watch her performance as an absolute masterclass. I'm disappointed with myself that I had never before made the effort to watch it and strongly recommend it.

    When Margot Channing, a big Broadway star, meets her biggest admirer, who calls herself Eve Harrington, she takes her in her home to help her and work with her. When Eve becomes Margot's understudy in a show, and obtains the part, jealousies start pouring out. Soon, Eve Harrington won't be the same, shy and humble person as she was before. It's a legendary Hollywood film not only because it broke the record of most Academy Award nominations (14), but because of its extremely witty, well-written dialogue, and because of the performances of Bette Davis, George Sanders, Anne Baxter, Hugh Marlowe, that make the film a tour-de-force of acting. Director Joseph Mankiewicz takes the advantage to also squeeze in a solemn hymn to theater, and at the same time, criticizing the ever-so-manipulating media always surrounding it; then, a detailed look at the actors and actresses' life, their rise and fall; by the end of the film, it is obvious that success in entertainment is dominated by a never-ending cycle pattern that connects one actor after the other, a pattern these kind of people must be part of, when trying to succeed. Six statuettes won at the Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Supporting Actor (George Sanders).

    Winner, Best Picture, 1951. An aspiring actress Eve, deceives an established and respected actress Margo with her charade. Margo gets impressed by her hundred percent attendance for all her shows and takes her as a personal assistant but Eve slowly gains the favor of the men involved in making the play and all of Margo's associates which ultimately results in her dethroning as the actress of the year. And as she decides to set foot in the Hollywood after she has received accolades for her brilliant performance, a stranger prepares to take the same position she took at Margo- a personal secretary. So the movie concludes with the phrase 'what goes around comes around'. Bette Davis is probably comparable only to Katharine Hepburn and has shown it once again why she is still called the First Lady of Cinema.

Eve's speech, and the glances the camera takes at the crowd, speak volumes about her character and the film's themes. Another point of note is how sharp the dialogue is. Being about theatre, many references get tossed around, of which I caught about 2: Macbeth and Hamlet. But all of the conversations have weight and wordplay that would make Shakespeare himself smile. All About Eve, despite being over 60 years old, is remarkably fresh. To start, this is probably the only film I've seen all year in which death is not a plot point. Also, in a medium which can be seen as male- dominated (there are 6 films higher than this on the Top 250 principally starring women), seeing female drama is unique. This story of deceit, undermining, fame and fakes is well- directed, well- acted, and enjoyable. Love the film, hate Eve. 9.0/10

    I saw this film on DVD recently and was stunned at the quality of every aspect - the scripting, direction and characters were all of a compelling wonderful quality and I couldn't see a single reason not to give it a 10/10 rating. It is dramatic, sharp, funny and thought provoking in a way that puts most modern films to shame Bette Davis is awesome and every young actress should watch her performance as an absolute masterclass. I'm disappointed with myself that I had never before made the effort to watch it and strongly recommend it.

    When Margot Channing, a big Broadway star, meets her biggest admirer, who calls herself Eve Harrington, she takes her in her home to help her and work with her. When Eve becomes Margot's understudy in a show, and obtains the part, jealousies start pouring out. Soon, Eve Harrington won't be the same, shy and humble person as she was before. It's a legendary Hollywood film not only because it broke the record of most Academy Award nominations (14), but because of its extremely witty, well-written dialogue, and because of the performances of Bette Davis, George Sanders, Anne Baxter, Hugh Marlowe, that make the film a tour-de-force of acting. Director Joseph Mankiewicz takes the advantage to also squeeze in a solemn hymn to theater, and at the same time, criticizing the ever-so-manipulating media always surrounding it; then, a detailed look at the actors and actresses' life, their rise and fall; by the end of the film, it is obvious that success in entertainment is dominated by a never-ending cycle pattern that connects one actor after the other, a pattern these kind of people must be part of, when trying to succeed. Six statuettes won at the Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Supporting Actor (George Sanders).

    Winner, Best Picture, 1951. An aspiring actress Eve, deceives an established and respected actress Margo with her charade. Margo gets impressed by her hundred percent attendance for all her shows and takes her as a personal assistant but Eve slowly gains the favor of the men involved in making the play and all of Margo's associates which ultimately results in her dethroning as the actress of the year. And as she decides to set foot in the Hollywood after she has received accolades for her brilliant performance, a stranger prepares to take the same position she took at Margo- a personal secretary. So the movie concludes with the phrase 'what goes around comes around'. Bette Davis is probably comparable only to Katharine Hepburn and has shown it once again why she is still called the First Lady of Cinema.

    The film is a rarity in that it was praised at its release, and has never critically waned. That, however is not the rarity I refer to; the rarity is that the film is deserving of the praise. It won many awards at many festivals, and was nominated for fourteen Oscars- a record tied only by the abysmal Titanic, in 1997- a film that represents an almost polar extreme from this film, in that it was all glitz and special effects, and had a terrible screenplay- one that dates Titanic, made almost a half century later, far more than All About Eve. This film garnered six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director (for Mankiewicz), Best Screenplay (for Mankiewicz) and Best Supporting Actor (for Sanders). Yet, despite all that, and my admiration for Mankiewicz's great writing, All About Eve is not a flat-out great film. It's close, a near-great, but the fact is that, for all of its stellar writing, it simply is not a deep film. In a sense, it recapitulates the shallow values all its lead characters embrace, in varying degrees. That, along with its rather pedestrian cinematography by Milton Krasner, as well as bad rear projection, in a scene of Eve and Addison walking in New Haven (even if its minimal soundtrack, by Alfred Newman, is commendable), are just enough to keep the film out of the pantheon of all time greats. Despite that, All About Eve is a great way to spend a few hours, and a shining example of classic Hollywood at its best (nearly).

    I'm a Christian and I give this a '9' I had read comments about the quality of the writing in this film but I really had no idea to what extent this would elevate the experience. The fact is, it leaves me with no other choice than to give it a perfect 10. Unless you see this film, I don't think you'll have the necessary frame of reference with which to to base any expectations on. It's an incredibly engrossing, moving and often comedic experience, but time and time again what knocks you over is the absolute finesse with which this script was crafted. The fact that the acting and direction are flawless and surprisingly natural-seeming (most old movies usually seem stiff or people seem to "act" too much) only enhances it that much more. With this film, you can really imagine the *people* the actors are portraying. "All About Eve" shows some similarity to one of my other favourite 50s films "A Face in the Crowd". Both are studies of fame and celebrity. Eve shows how a person will corrupt themselves in order to attain it, whereas A Face's premise is that fame corrupts those who find themselves in the spotlight. Both have themes that are perhaps even more resonant in our celebrity-obsessed culture now than when they were made. Interestingly, Eve predates A Face by several years. And possibly most interesting of all is the honest and often raw way in which women are portrayed, the strength of their character and the power they wield. The male contingent is practically relegated to the back seat. One might be hard pressed to find a movie quite so "liberated" today. So what more can I say? If you love movies and you haven't yet seen it, you've suffered long enough; don't wait another day.

    Actors are only as good as the material they must memorize, and here, that material is a combination of silk, satin and only the finest of cotton. Certainly, female leads Bette Davis and Anne Baxter are the epitome of perfection, and dominate everybody around them. Their fellow actors have nothing to gripe about either, hence a total of five acting Oscar Nominations. Every detail in this movie is picture perfect, even if the obvious backdrop of New Haven in one sequence is clearly stock footage and the final sequence drawn out to be a tad long. Davis, in arguably her finest film, is obviously emulating Tallulah Bankhead (no matter whom the original story was based upon), and it is fascinating to watch her go from bitch to saint, as well as the titled Eve (Anne Baxter) go from saint to bitch. Davis's Margo Channing is an extremely complex character, perhaps not as drag-queenish as Tallulah could be, and you will find yourself sympathizing with her as she reaches that difficult age of 40, which she expands on realistically through several philosophical monologues in which she reals the truth about who she really is underneath all the glitz and glamor of Broadway. Underneath all of that sardonic humor is what even Eve describes her to be as a truly great woman. Starting off like a drenched urchin, Baxter makes you pity her, but soon you see where her ambition really lies and how she intends to utilize, throw out and possibly destroy the others around her. But along comes the wait-and-see lion type character played by George Sanders and you know her fall will be swift and destructive, and no matter what happens in her rising career, her true character will end up being exposed for the manipulative passive/aggressive cat she really is. Celeste Holm has the hardest job, making you like her Melanie Wilkes like character without being annoyed by her excessive sweetness. You can see initially why she's fooled by Baxter, and in watching her grow a few claws in the film's second half, you really root for her to aid in Eve's soulful destruction. Thelma Ritter turns a hamburger helper part into steak simply by just being Thelma Ritter. Marilyn Monroe adds sly sensuality to a typical sexpot who happens to have a bit of hidden smarts in that bubble head of hers. It is obvious that there is something very special in her, and it is nice to see her working with Davis, equally as exciting as it was to see her with Barbara Stanwyck a few years later in "Clash By Night". Speaking of Stanwyck, there's a very funny reference by cub reporter Barbara Bates in the final scene referring to her and Susan Hayward as actresses from Brooklyn, but "they're only movie stars", a reference which reflects the snobbery of Broadway towards movie people. Then men in this film besides the bitchy Sanders (who deservedly won his Oscar) are less showy but they go out of their way to do more than just be a masculine presence on the arms of these colorful females. This could have given the film a camp presence, and it certainly does have that, but there is also a thought-provoking intelligence to it that is mesmerizing. Directing his own script (just as he did the previous year with "A Letter to Three Wives" for which he also took home two Oscars), Joseph Mankiewicz instills much unique detail into every segment that the film is truly unforgettable. Delightfully bitchy dialog that has gone down into the screenplay hall of frame is surrounded by some lesser known unknown gems and even in those sequences (such as one where Davis and group all bite viciously into a stalk of celery as a response to Sanders and Baxter's presence at a table near theirs), and everything comes up roses for everybody. You'll cheer for Margo Channing as she learns a major lesson from Eve's scheming, responding in a way that truly makes her a much better person.

    If ever there was (is or will be) a film destined to have critics grovel over it, it's a film where a critic is the smartest man in the room and who gets the hot chicks. It's also appealing to all reporters/journalists in that sense. Another artistic technicality well played for an otherwise dull soap opera. It's apropos that the film itself is cynical and paranoid and promotes such a view of the world. It does manage to be an inside, self promotional, look at both Hollywood and theater and its vicious recursive circle of stardom. An early look at the transition from plays/theater to Hollywood and the desire even in the late 1940s to be a movie star. Not much else. It doesn't age well. It's more like a look at what life turned out to be during the 1950s. Like The Third Man (1949), it's composed of artistic/intellectual clever tricks (including ways around censorship) to hide a tedious story of self referential self importance. If anything, this post-war soap opera of seriousness where none is deserved is a reflection of one of the main failings of a film industry at the time that missed the full potential of a real life Betty Boop in Marilyn Monroe. Painfully uninventive like a typical critic.

    I've heard about this film for years, but only now, the same night I'm watching my first Bette Davis film and having a marathon, am I able to properly experience it. Again, it's such an iconic film and you can pretty much know how the whole thing will work out (but again, the opening scene does make it clear as well if one is paying attention). Davis' performance is considered among the best ever, and it's very deserved. But Anne Baxter is also pretty amazing, and she plays the two sides we see of Eve perfectly, revealing her character more and more as the film goes along until we see her for the monster she is. But it's still very much a theme that is present in our times now.

    All about Eve is a 1950. movie directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, starring Bette Davis, Anne Baxter and George Sanders. The first scene in the movie is at a award ceremony regarding the theater. The most prestigious award (the Sarah Siddons Award for Distinguished Achievement) goes to non other than Eve Harrington, the brightest star of the theater, the golden girl like critic Addison Dewitt calls her (one of the narrators). According to Addison, we (public) know all about Eve and before the story really begins, we see Eve Harrington collecting her award and the movie freezes just at that most glorious moment of her life, the highest point of her young career. And later, once we meet Eve, the director takes us back to that moment. Who is Eve Harrington?! She is a lovely, innocent, sensitive, honest, understanding, warm young girl who is in deep love with the theater and crazy about her acting hero Margo Channing, the born star of the theater, a temperament, sometimes harsh woman capable of fighting through life. Eve meets Margo, becomes her assistant and little by little invades her life in a sweet way. Suddenly everyone becomes fond of Eve and Margo who is going through a midlife crises starts feeling the threat of innocent, young Eve. Margo is insecure, jealous, oversensitive and starts driving her friends away by her behavior while Eve is slowly taking her place, in her circle of friends and in the theater. Margo is falling and Eve is rising... I don't want to spoil the film for you so I'm going to stop but I will warn you that there is a great turn in the movie which I absolutely loved. Bette Davis as Margo and Anne Baxter as Eve were both stunning, I loved them. The bought me with their acting and contributed greatly to the movie's overall effect. Other supporting actors were great also, especially George Sanders as the cynical critic Addison Dewitt. He is the only one who won the Oscar. The dramatic plot is great, the editing also. The dialog is precise and intelligent. I have only words of praise for this movie. I loved it. The twist and the turn, the victims and the victimizers. I really tried not to spoil this movie for you, Eve is really a incredible character, unique and Addison Dewitt puts it very got at the end: "there never was and never will be another one like you". See for yourself...

    Right off of the start one thing becomes apparent: my opinion of Sunset Blvd. is critical to how much I'd like this film. Fortunately, I love Sunset Blvd, so much in fact that I gave it one out of eleven "ten's". However, the similar topics forces a comparison, and seeing Sunset Blvd first leads to a natural bias, leaning towards that film. I truly enjoyed All About Eve, and if you see it first, you may think different than me, numerically. Like Mad Men, which gets an apparent creative boost from being about creative folk, All About Eve is a film about entertainment by entertainers. Which, as the trend goes for such occasions, makes it incredible. The story is rich, with many little things that can't be pinpointed. But on a larger scale, everything is enjoyable. The actor's performances are mesmerizing; Davis' aging, displaced star is wonderfully upsetting and relateable. Sanders' deWitt is slimy but charming, with such a confident voice. But it's all about Eve. As Chris Rock would say, "you're goddamned disgusting!" And she is, oh, so wretched. Even in her first scene, the false humility and gratefulness leaks through her facade, and the cracks grow from there. By the end though it comes full circle, with a bitterly poetic conclusion. Eve's speech, and the glances the camera takes at the crowd, speak volumes about her character and the film's themes. Another point of note is how sharp the dialogue is. Being about theatre, many references get tossed around, of which I caught about 2: Macbeth and Hamlet. But all of the conversations have weight and wordplay that would make Shakespeare himself smile. All About Eve, despite being over 60 years old, is remarkably fresh. To start, this is probably the only film I've seen all year in which death is not a plot point. Also, in a medium which can be seen as male- dominated (there are 6 films higher than this on the Top 250 principally starring women), seeing female drama is unique. This story of deceit, undermining, fame and fakes is well- directed, well- acted, and enjoyable. Love the film, hate Eve. 9.0/10
