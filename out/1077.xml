    Some lazy and uninformed Critics and Reviewers can't help themselves and immediately lash out at this Movie's similarity to others Directed by Tarantino, Rodriguez, Stone, and Lynch. Truth of the Matter is that when Films are so near in release dates it is unfair and somewhat inaccurate to claim thievery. It is more likely and a bit Metaphysical that these Creative Folks were all tapping into that Akashic Record thing or what may be called the Hundred Monkey Theory. Whatever. This is a very good, Fun-Frolic Road Movie with White Trash Anti-Heroes and a Kick-Ass Soundtrack. More quirky characters than have a right to exist in any one Movie and some Witty Banter that makes it all quite a Rolicking Ride. It is over the top, around the bend, down the rabbit hole and off into outer space. Nutzoid and Naughty, Dirty and Delightful, with a Cast that cries out Cult Movie. It is proudly self-conscious, Violent, and Funny enough for it to become part of the Zeitgeist that was working in its Day and can not be ignored. This one will do nothing but gain Reputation and Admiration acquiring more Fans every Year. It was an easy thing to miss and dismiss this in the Mid-Nineties but if nothing else, the Success of Renee Zellweger will have the curious seeking this one out as a Career Starter and while she is a standout here, this Movie has more to offer and does so with layers of interest far beyond anything as shallow as Star Power. It gets its energy from a Chemical Compound and a Cultural Milieu that is forever Fascinating.

    Texas convenience store robber Gil Bellows (as Watford "Watty" Watts) and his blonde sexpot Renee Zellweger (as Starlene "Star" Cheatham) get into trouble when a hold-up gets unexpected bloody. As a rule, Mr. Bellows commits his robberies with an unloaded gun. "Never rob a store with a loaded gun," he advises, "never." We're supposed to ignore the fact that he breaks the rule immediately; the young clerk in the opening minutes would have relieved tension by pulling the trigger after hearing it wasn't loaded, if not sooner. Next to break the rule is crazy strung-out accomplice Rory Cochrane (as Billy Mack Black)... The bloody mess results in Bellows and Ms. Zellweger leaving their romantic trailer park for Mexico, in a baby blue 1972 Plymouth. Before booking, Bellows sticks a fork and a knife in Mr. Cochrane, thinking he's done with the dude. Turns out, he's not. Along the violent road trip we meet director C.M. Talkington in a tattoo shop. Suburban hippie Peter Fonda and passionate wife Ann Wedgeworth also appear. They disappear, alas, but leave behind a trippy bottle of Sandoz... In one of the funniest of a few good laughs, the comedy's co-stars turn on the TV as a favor to a bound and gagged reverend; horrifically, they leave it tuned to a home shopping channel. Bellows and Zellweger are and attractive couple, but do not even approach older outlaws "Bonnie and Clyde" (1967) or contemporary "Natural Born Killers" Mickey and Mallory (1994). Bellows is a scruffy Sal Mineo. Zellweger is a Southern Kelly Bundy, acting with her legs first. It is refreshing to see the actors shake more than the cameras. Consisting of appropriate oldies and original music by Tom Verlaine, the soundtrack, is a main strength. ***** Love and a .45 (9/10/94) C.M.

    I found this one on Netflix streaming movies, when I was searching for Renee Zellweger movies. I like her as an actress, ever since "The Whole Wide World", plus she grew up and went to school right close to us, in Katy, Texas just off the western edge of metropolitan Houston. I found this in a 1997 Texas Monthly feature: " All reliable evidence suggests that she (Zellweger) did not dream of being on the silver screen from day one. Growing up in Katy, she was more jock than drama queen, running track and cross-country and playing basketball. When she left Katy to attend the University of Texas at Austin, she wanted to be a writer. As an English major, she says, "I went all over the place, from Puritanism to British lit to the Victorians, to Hawthorne to Faulkner to name it." When she began to act at age twenty, it was to pay the bills; doing commercials for beer companies and fast-food restaurants may have been an unglamorous grind, especially with all the trips to Dallas to audition for parts she didn't get, but it was preferable to work-study or the lucrative but equally unglamorous time she spent as a waitress in the Austin topless bar Sugar's. " She certainly has had an interesting path to stardom. Here she is the half-wit girlfriend of an ex-con, Gil Bellows as Watty Watts. Zellweger's character is Starlene Cheatham . One of Watty's ex-con friends is Rory Cochrane as Billy Mack Black , just about as weird a character as you will find. They are petty thieves in east Texas (areas between Dallas and Tyler, they mention) and when one robbery goes especially bad, and the clerk is shot and killed, everyone goes on the run. Eventually heading for Mexico, leaving a trail of dead bodies. Peter Fonda has a small but interesting role as Starlene's dad, Vergil Cheatham, who early in his life had his vocal chords ripped out, and now uses a type of vibrator held to his throat to speak, of sorts. This is not a good movie by any usual stretch of the imagination. Almost every scene has one crook or the other pointing a gun at someone's head, and everyone spouting foul language. It seems it is supposed to be a dark comedy of sorts, I enjoyed seeing Zellweger in her early 20s and just getting started in her career, but I could not recommend this to anyone for any other reason.

    Renee Zellweger, as far removed from her Bridget Jones persona as it is possible to get, plays Starlene, the girlfriend of small-time robber Watty Watts (Gil Bellows). Watts never takes a loaded gun into a robbery, but his druggy partner Billy Mack isn't quite so careful and ends up shooting dead his girlfriend when she recognises him during a hold-up. Forced to go on the run after wounding an increasingly flaky Billy Mack, Watty and Starlene encounter a host of quirky characters during their flight. It's sort of ironic, the way other reviewers accuse C. M. Talkington, the writer and director of this admittedly over-derivative lovers-on-the-run sub-genre, of ripping off Tarantino, given that the self-aggrandising Mr. T. has hardly had one original idea in his whole career. Tarantino's gift is injecting his own distinctive style into other people's scenarios and passing off the result as an homage. It's quite incredible to think this has been working for him for twenty years now with hardly any dent to his reputation Anyway, Love and a .45 is clearly inspired by the kind of thing Tarantino does, but it at least has its own unique style and an identity separate from QT's oeuvre. Despite all the violence, the film has a likability about it that is unexpected and possesses a manic energy that enables the audience to overlook some character inconsistencies. It's a cartoon-ish kind of world, inhabited by larger-than-life characters who thoughtlessly use violence as a handy device to get them what they need, and as such it's a world that couldn't survive for long outside the confines of a Hollywood movie, but while we're in it we are at least taken on an enjoyable ride and supplied with a vicarious thrill while remaining safely in front of our screens.

    Back in the early 90's there seemed to be a plethora of films about young outlaw couples on the run from the law. They were a combination between the road movie and the crime-thriller. Wild At Heart, True Romance, Natural Born Killers and even Thelma and Louise are examples of this phenomenon. Who really knows why they were so popular, but whatever the reason, Love and a .45 is yet another one from this cycle. I think it would be only fair to say that it's a minor entry, and it doesn't compare too favourably with those other movies mentioned above. Also in common with these other flicks, this one has a pretty strong emphasis on humour too. And perhaps this is one of the main flaws because, generally speaking, most of the supposed laughs aren't that funny. Its dependent on its characters who are supposed to be quirky and left-field enough to raise a smile. But the two gangsters and the psychotic 'friend' are mainly pretty annoying; while Peter Fonda's hippy dad may talk through a voice box but that accounts for one initial smile and gets old fast - he's essentially a one joke character. The story is a fairly generic bit of crime fiction. Its certainly serviceable although not especially memorable on its own terms. In the movie's favour is the fact that it does have a fast pace and it never truly outstays it welcome. That said, it isn't really too much of a shock that director C. M. Talkington didn't go on to forge a film career, as his direction of everything isn't too good. There is some potential here for a much more entertaining story but the writing, the performances and the direction aren't strong enough to make it so. Overall, this isn't a bad film particularly but its no more than a fairly mediocre entry in a well-worn sub-genre.

    LOVE AND A .45 is a hip electric road trip road movie from hell that takes place on the black top back country roads and highways of the great state of Texas and all the way to Mexico. With brilliant acting as well as casting, this shotgun blast of a movie was released in 1994 by genius Texas director C.M. Talkington, whose amazing writing, characters, plot and style make this film pop with crisp imagery and storytelling. Vibrant cameos by Peter Fonda and Anne Wedgeworth, and simply perfect classic Texas outlaw roles Watty and Starlene, played by Gill Bellows and Renee Zellweger deliver. Every single performance adds the heart of truth to this entirely original classic violent modern Texas gangster film. The comfort in their parts and swagger in which the entire cast carry themselves in the movie is truly famous. Not to mention, an amazing soundtrack that adds a thump to your stomach and a rockabilly jingle of guitar by the likes of the Reverend Horton Heat, who also plays music behind strippers in the movie. Electric chair Huntsville prison stories, cops blasted in the face by psychopathic tweaked out ex cons, robberies gone awry, gruesome bloody scalp tattoos, shots of meth from high powered air needles, soul mate outlaw lovers on the run to freedom and life, burnt up hippies, and bumbling idiot thugs, this movies got it all. The best movie I've ever seen. RIP Dinosaur Bob!!! -Jeff Callaway, Texas Outlaw Poet

    I took the time to register just so you can see an awesome flick. This film is right up there with Pulp Fiction, Snatch, Lock Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels, even Fight Club. I am not gonna do a critique here, but it has it all - its funny at times, and deadly serious at others. It has a great flow, and the soundtrack is perfect. I'd never heard of the Reverend Horton Heat or Mazzy Star, but they rock this flick. Frankly I am very surprised that we haven't heard from the Director in any other films. I just checked, and this and something called Killers Head are about it. Anyways, watch it and it might become one of your favorites too!

    Hollywood over does the PWT genre. Almost turned it off several times but for some reason I sat through every tortuous minute. If the people it depicts really exist then same folk will like this movie. Otherwise it is stupid and pointless. So was "Pulp Fiction". Also, since I have to commit 10 lines in order to be heard, I'll say the nickel plated Government model was cool but the scene where he gave away the blued Colt didn't fit. "Love and 45" must have been edited by committee, or it ran out of money, or it was just a drill for junior actors, actress's, and writers developing their skills for future movies. Looks like Barbarella's brother played himself almost.

    In the 90s, movies about quirky criminals and their misadventures were especially popular. "Love and a .45" aims for "Raising Arizona" and falls somewhat short of "Spun". A charismatic and Eastern philosophy following convenience store robber and his aspiring movie-star girlfriend have to go on the run after a run-in from the cops caused by their friend Billy Mack making the mistake of loading a gun and getting high before a robbery. A self-consciously wacky Texas road trip movie ensues with creepy loan sharks, insane druggies, and aged hippies speckled throughout, with more than enough references to "Bonnie and Clyde". Gil Bellows as Watty certainly keeps the movie rolling with his pleasantness and charm. He's the really interesting character here; Starlene (Renee Zellweger) really slows the movie down with her incessant rambling about being on television. Rory Cochrane is all over the spectrum, and in the right mindset he can be really funny or incredibly obnoxious. Jack Nance and Peter Fonda make appearances for all you cult cinema lovers out there, and... well... that's about it, really, as far as what this movie offers that's different from anything else. Well, it does have a splendid Southern-themed soundtrack. I think, overall, that the movie was a decent ride but that the director should have removed himself a bit away from an obvious liking to his characters. The movie is very aware of how quirky the characters are, and thus spends more energy staging them than letting them drive the storyline. In a romp of this nature, cutting things that drag is somewhat necessary. --PolarisDiB

    After seeing this movie again today and thinking back at the time when i first watch it on VHS back in 95 ,do i realize it is part guilty of me wanted to try out dope for the first time!!(gladly kicked that habit). This is a classic road movie with the right Tarrantino feel . Its about two sweethearts on the run from the law & some creepy speed freaks after the two companions Watty Watts(Gill Bellows)and Billy Mack Black(Rory Cochrane) attending in a robbery gone bad. Good entertainment and good Texacan dialogs . It clearly an underestimated movie that should get much more credit that it has received . This is also one of Ren&eacute;e Zellweger first major movie role.

This is a very good, Fun-Frolic Road Movie with White Trash Anti-Heroes and a Kick-Ass Soundtrack. More quirky characters than have a right to exist in any one Movie and some Witty Banter that makes it all quite a Rolicking Ride.

This one will do nothing but gain Reputation and Admiration acquiring more Fans every Year. It was an easy thing to miss and dismiss this in the Mid-Nineties but if nothing else, the Success of Renee Zellweger will have the curious seeking this one out as a Career Starter and while she is a standout here, this Movie has more to offer and does so with layers of interest far beyond anything as shallow as Star Power. It gets its energy from a Chemical Compound and a Cultural Milieu that is forever Fascinating.

    I took the time to register just so you can see an awesome flick. This film is right up there with Pulp Fiction, Snatch, Lock Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels, even Fight Club. I am not gonna do a critique here, but it has it all - its funny at times, and deadly serious at others. It has a great flow, and the soundtrack is perfect. I'd never heard of the Reverend Horton Heat or Mazzy Star, but they rock this flick. Frankly I am very surprised that we haven't heard from the Director in any other films. I just checked, and this and something called Killers Head are about it. Anyways, watch it and it might become one of your favorites too!

    Hollywood over does the PWT genre. Almost turned it off several times but for some reason I sat through every tortuous minute. If the people it depicts really exist then same folk will like this movie. Otherwise it is stupid and pointless. So was "Pulp Fiction". Also, since I have to commit 10 lines in order to be heard, I'll say the nickel plated Government model was cool but the scene where he gave away the blued Colt didn't fit. "Love and 45" must have been edited by committee, or it ran out of money, or it was just a drill for junior actors, actress's, and writers developing their skills for future movies. Looks like Barbarella's brother played himself almost.

    In the 90s, movies about quirky criminals and their misadventures were especially popular. "Love and a .45" aims for "Raising Arizona" and falls somewhat short of "Spun". A charismatic and Eastern philosophy following convenience store robber and his aspiring movie-star girlfriend have to go on the run after a run-in from the cops caused by their friend Billy Mack making the mistake of loading a gun and getting high before a robbery. A self-consciously wacky Texas road trip movie ensues with creepy loan sharks, insane druggies, and aged hippies speckled throughout, with more than enough references to "Bonnie and Clyde". Gil Bellows as Watty certainly keeps the movie rolling with his pleasantness and charm. He's the really interesting character here; Starlene (Renee Zellweger) really slows the movie down with her incessant rambling about being on television. Rory Cochrane is all over the spectrum, and in the right mindset he can be really funny or incredibly obnoxious. Jack Nance and Peter Fonda make appearances for all you cult cinema lovers out there, and... well... that's about it, really, as far as what this movie offers that's different from anything else. Well, it does have a splendid Southern-themed soundtrack. I think, overall, that the movie was a decent ride but that the director should have removed himself a bit away from an obvious liking to his characters. The movie is very aware of how quirky the characters are, and thus spends more energy staging them than letting them drive the storyline. In a romp of this nature, cutting things that drag is somewhat necessary. --PolarisDiB

    After seeing this movie again today and thinking back at the time when i first watch it on VHS back in 95 ,do i realize it is part guilty of me wanted to try out dope for the first time!!(gladly kicked that habit). This is a classic road movie with the right Tarrantino feel . Its about two sweethearts on the run from the law & some creepy speed freaks after the two companions Watty Watts(Gill Bellows)and Billy Mack Black(Rory Cochrane) attending in a robbery gone bad. Good entertainment and good Texacan dialogs . It clearly an underestimated movie that should get much more credit that it has received . This is also one of Ren&eacute;e Zellweger first major movie role.

    Some lazy and uninformed Critics and Reviewers can't help themselves and immediately lash out at this Movie's similarity to others Directed by Tarantino, Rodriguez, Stone, and Lynch. Truth of the Matter is that when Films are so near in release dates it is unfair and somewhat inaccurate to claim thievery. It is more likely and a bit Metaphysical that these Creative Folks were all tapping into that Akashic Record thing or what may be called the Hundred Monkey Theory. Whatever. This is a very good, Fun-Frolic Road Movie with White Trash Anti-Heroes and a Kick-Ass Soundtrack. More quirky characters than have a right to exist in any one Movie and some Witty Banter that makes it all quite a Rolicking Ride. It is over the top, around the bend, down the rabbit hole and off into outer space. Nutzoid and Naughty, Dirty and Delightful, with a Cast that cries out Cult Movie. It is proudly self-conscious, Violent, and Funny enough for it to become part of the Zeitgeist that was working in its Day and can not be ignored. This one will do nothing but gain Reputation and Admiration acquiring more Fans every Year. It was an easy thing to miss and dismiss this in the Mid-Nineties but if nothing else, the Success of Renee Zellweger will have the curious seeking this one out as a Career Starter and while she is a standout here, this Movie has more to offer and does so with layers of interest far beyond anything as shallow as Star Power. It gets its energy from a Chemical Compound and a Cultural Milieu that is forever Fascinating.

    Texas convenience store robber Gil Bellows (as Watford "Watty" Watts) and his blonde sexpot Renee Zellweger (as Starlene "Star" Cheatham) get into trouble when a hold-up gets unexpected bloody. As a rule, Mr. Bellows commits his robberies with an unloaded gun. "Never rob a store with a loaded gun," he advises, "never." We're supposed to ignore the fact that he breaks the rule immediately; the young clerk in the opening minutes would have relieved tension by pulling the trigger after hearing it wasn't loaded, if not sooner. Next to break the rule is crazy strung-out accomplice Rory Cochrane (as Billy Mack Black)... The bloody mess results in Bellows and Ms. Zellweger leaving their romantic trailer park for Mexico, in a baby blue 1972 Plymouth. Before booking, Bellows sticks a fork and a knife in Mr. Cochrane, thinking he's done with the dude. Turns out, he's not. Along the violent road trip we meet director C.M. Talkington in a tattoo shop. Suburban hippie Peter Fonda and passionate wife Ann Wedgeworth also appear. They disappear, alas, but leave behind a trippy bottle of Sandoz... In one of the funniest of a few good laughs, the comedy's co-stars turn on the TV as a favor to a bound and gagged reverend; horrifically, they leave it tuned to a home shopping channel. Bellows and Zellweger are and attractive couple, but do not even approach older outlaws "Bonnie and Clyde" (1967) or contemporary "Natural Born Killers" Mickey and Mallory (1994). Bellows is a scruffy Sal Mineo. Zellweger is a Southern Kelly Bundy, acting with her legs first. It is refreshing to see the actors shake more than the cameras. Consisting of appropriate oldies and original music by Tom Verlaine, the soundtrack, is a main strength. ***** Love and a .45 (9/10/94) C.M.

    I found this one on Netflix streaming movies, when I was searching for Renee Zellweger movies. I like her as an actress, ever since "The Whole Wide World", plus she grew up and went to school right close to us, in Katy, Texas just off the western edge of metropolitan Houston. I found this in a 1997 Texas Monthly feature: " All reliable evidence suggests that she (Zellweger) did not dream of being on the silver screen from day one. Growing up in Katy, she was more jock than drama queen, running track and cross-country and playing basketball. When she left Katy to attend the University of Texas at Austin, she wanted to be a writer. As an English major, she says, "I went all over the place, from Puritanism to British lit to the Victorians, to Hawthorne to Faulkner to name it." When she began to act at age twenty, it was to pay the bills; doing commercials for beer companies and fast-food restaurants may have been an unglamorous grind, especially with all the trips to Dallas to audition for parts she didn't get, but it was preferable to work-study or the lucrative but equally unglamorous time she spent as a waitress in the Austin topless bar Sugar's. " She certainly has had an interesting path to stardom. Here she is the half-wit girlfriend of an ex-con, Gil Bellows as Watty Watts. Zellweger's character is Starlene Cheatham . One of Watty's ex-con friends is Rory Cochrane as Billy Mack Black , just about as weird a character as you will find. They are petty thieves in east Texas (areas between Dallas and Tyler, they mention) and when one robbery goes especially bad, and the clerk is shot and killed, everyone goes on the run. Eventually heading for Mexico, leaving a trail of dead bodies. Peter Fonda has a small but interesting role as Starlene's dad, Vergil Cheatham, who early in his life had his vocal chords ripped out, and now uses a type of vibrator held to his throat to speak, of sorts. This is not a good movie by any usual stretch of the imagination. Almost every scene has one crook or the other pointing a gun at someone's head, and everyone spouting foul language. It seems it is supposed to be a dark comedy of sorts, I enjoyed seeing Zellweger in her early 20s and just getting started in her career, but I could not recommend this to anyone for any other reason.

    Renee Zellweger, as far removed from her Bridget Jones persona as it is possible to get, plays Starlene, the girlfriend of small-time robber Watty Watts (Gil Bellows). Watts never takes a loaded gun into a robbery, but his druggy partner Billy Mack isn't quite so careful and ends up shooting dead his girlfriend when she recognises him during a hold-up. Forced to go on the run after wounding an increasingly flaky Billy Mack, Watty and Starlene encounter a host of quirky characters during their flight. It's sort of ironic, the way other reviewers accuse C. M. Talkington, the writer and director of this admittedly over-derivative lovers-on-the-run sub-genre, of ripping off Tarantino, given that the self-aggrandising Mr. T. has hardly had one original idea in his whole career. Tarantino's gift is injecting his own distinctive style into other people's scenarios and passing off the result as an homage. It's quite incredible to think this has been working for him for twenty years now with hardly any dent to his reputation Anyway, Love and a .45 is clearly inspired by the kind of thing Tarantino does, but it at least has its own unique style and an identity separate from QT's oeuvre. Despite all the violence, the film has a likability about it that is unexpected and possesses a manic energy that enables the audience to overlook some character inconsistencies. It's a cartoon-ish kind of world, inhabited by larger-than-life characters who thoughtlessly use violence as a handy device to get them what they need, and as such it's a world that couldn't survive for long outside the confines of a Hollywood movie, but while we're in it we are at least taken on an enjoyable ride and supplied with a vicarious thrill while remaining safely in front of our screens.

    Back in the early 90's there seemed to be a plethora of films about young outlaw couples on the run from the law. They were a combination between the road movie and the crime-thriller. Wild At Heart, True Romance, Natural Born Killers and even Thelma and Louise are examples of this phenomenon. Who really knows why they were so popular, but whatever the reason, Love and a .45 is yet another one from this cycle. I think it would be only fair to say that it's a minor entry, and it doesn't compare too favourably with those other movies mentioned above. Also in common with these other flicks, this one has a pretty strong emphasis on humour too. And perhaps this is one of the main flaws because, generally speaking, most of the supposed laughs aren't that funny. Its dependent on its characters who are supposed to be quirky and left-field enough to raise a smile. But the two gangsters and the psychotic 'friend' are mainly pretty annoying; while Peter Fonda's hippy dad may talk through a voice box but that accounts for one initial smile and gets old fast - he's essentially a one joke character. The story is a fairly generic bit of crime fiction. Its certainly serviceable although not especially memorable on its own terms. In the movie's favour is the fact that it does have a fast pace and it never truly outstays it welcome. That said, it isn't really too much of a shock that director C. M. Talkington didn't go on to forge a film career, as his direction of everything isn't too good. There is some potential here for a much more entertaining story but the writing, the performances and the direction aren't strong enough to make it so. Overall, this isn't a bad film particularly but its no more than a fairly mediocre entry in a well-worn sub-genre.

    LOVE AND A .45 is a hip electric road trip road movie from hell that takes place on the black top back country roads and highways of the great state of Texas and all the way to Mexico. With brilliant acting as well as casting, this shotgun blast of a movie was released in 1994 by genius Texas director C.M. Talkington, whose amazing writing, characters, plot and style make this film pop with crisp imagery and storytelling. Vibrant cameos by Peter Fonda and Anne Wedgeworth, and simply perfect classic Texas outlaw roles Watty and Starlene, played by Gill Bellows and Renee Zellweger deliver. Every single performance adds the heart of truth to this entirely original classic violent modern Texas gangster film. The comfort in their parts and swagger in which the entire cast carry themselves in the movie is truly famous. Not to mention, an amazing soundtrack that adds a thump to your stomach and a rockabilly jingle of guitar by the likes of the Reverend Horton Heat, who also plays music behind strippers in the movie. Electric chair Huntsville prison stories, cops blasted in the face by psychopathic tweaked out ex cons, robberies gone awry, gruesome bloody scalp tattoos, shots of meth from high powered air needles, soul mate outlaw lovers on the run to freedom and life, burnt up hippies, and bumbling idiot thugs, this movies got it all. The best movie I've ever seen. RIP Dinosaur Bob!!! -Jeff Callaway, Texas Outlaw Poet

    Hollywood over does the PWT genre. Almost turned it off several times but for some reason I sat through every tortuous minute. If the people it depicts really exist then same folk will like this movie. Otherwise it is stupid and pointless. So was "Pulp Fiction". Also, since I have to commit 10 lines in order to be heard, I'll say the nickel plated Government model was cool but the scene where he gave away the blued Colt didn't fit. "Love and 45" must have been edited by committee, or it ran out of money, or it was just a drill for junior actors, actress's, and writers developing their skills for future movies. Looks like Barbarella's brother played himself almost.

It was an easy thing to miss and dismiss this in the Mid-Nineties but if nothing else, the Success of Renee Zellweger will have the curious seeking this one out as a Career Starter and while she is a standout here, this Movie has more to offer and does so with layers of interest far beyond anything as shallow as Star Power. It gets its energy from a Chemical Compound and a Cultural Milieu that is forever Fascinating.

But the two gangsters and the psychotic 'friend' are mainly pretty annoying; while Peter Fonda's hippy dad may talk through a voice box but that accounts for one initial smile and gets old fast - he's essentially a one joke character. The story is a fairly generic bit of crime fiction. Its certainly serviceable although not especially memorable on its own terms. In the movie's favour is the fact that it does have a fast pace and it never truly outstays it welcome. That said, it isn't really too much of a shock that director C. M. Talkington didn't go on to forge a film career, as his direction of everything isn't too good. There is some potential here for a much more entertaining story but the writing, the performances and the direction aren't strong enough to make it so. Overall, this isn't a bad film particularly but its no more than a fairly mediocre entry in a well-worn sub-genre.

    LOVE AND A .45 is a hip electric road trip road movie from hell that takes place on the black top back country roads and highways of the great state of Texas and all the way to Mexico. With brilliant acting as well as casting, this shotgun blast of a movie was released in 1994 by genius Texas director C.M. Talkington, whose amazing writing, characters, plot and style make this film pop with crisp imagery and storytelling. Vibrant cameos by Peter Fonda and Anne Wedgeworth, and simply perfect classic Texas outlaw roles Watty and Starlene, played by Gill Bellows and Renee Zellweger deliver. Every single performance adds the heart of truth to this entirely original classic violent modern Texas gangster film. The comfort in their parts and swagger in which the entire cast carry themselves in the movie is truly famous. Not to mention, an amazing soundtrack that adds a thump to your stomach and a rockabilly jingle of guitar by the likes of the Reverend Horton Heat, who also plays music behind strippers in the movie. Electric chair Huntsville prison stories, cops blasted in the face by psychopathic tweaked out ex cons, robberies gone awry, gruesome bloody scalp tattoos, shots of meth from high powered air needles, soul mate outlaw lovers on the run to freedom and life, burnt up hippies, and bumbling idiot thugs, this movies got it all. The best movie I've ever seen. RIP Dinosaur Bob!!! -Jeff Callaway, Texas Outlaw Poet

    I took the time to register just so you can see an awesome flick. This film is right up there with Pulp Fiction, Snatch, Lock Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels, even Fight Club. I am not gonna do a critique here, but it has it all - its funny at times, and deadly serious at others. It has a great flow, and the soundtrack is perfect. I'd never heard of the Reverend Horton Heat or Mazzy Star, but they rock this flick. Frankly I am very surprised that we haven't heard from the Director in any other films. I just checked, and this and something called Killers Head are about it. Anyways, watch it and it might become one of your favorites too!

    Hollywood over does the PWT genre. Almost turned it off several times but for some reason I sat through every tortuous minute. If the people it depicts really exist then same folk will like this movie. Otherwise it is stupid and pointless. So was "Pulp Fiction". Also, since I have to commit 10 lines in order to be heard, I'll say the nickel plated Government model was cool but the scene where he gave away the blued Colt didn't fit. "Love and 45" must have been edited by committee, or it ran out of money, or it was just a drill for junior actors, actress's, and writers developing their skills for future movies. Looks like Barbarella's brother played himself almost.

    In the 90s, movies about quirky criminals and their misadventures were especially popular. "Love and a .45" aims for "Raising Arizona" and falls somewhat short of "Spun". A charismatic and Eastern philosophy following convenience store robber and his aspiring movie-star girlfriend have to go on the run after a run-in from the cops caused by their friend Billy Mack making the mistake of loading a gun and getting high before a robbery. A self-consciously wacky Texas road trip movie ensues with creepy loan sharks, insane druggies, and aged hippies speckled throughout, with more than enough references to "Bonnie and Clyde". Gil Bellows as Watty certainly keeps the movie rolling with his pleasantness and charm. He's the really interesting character here; Starlene (Renee Zellweger) really slows the movie down with her incessant rambling about being on television. Rory Cochrane is all over the spectrum, and in the right mindset he can be really funny or incredibly obnoxious. Jack Nance and Peter Fonda make appearances for all you cult cinema lovers out there, and... well... that's about it, really, as far as what this movie offers that's different from anything else. Well, it does have a splendid Southern-themed soundtrack. I think, overall, that the movie was a decent ride but that the director should have removed himself a bit away from an obvious liking to his characters. The movie is very aware of how quirky the characters are, and thus spends more energy staging them than letting them drive the storyline. In a romp of this nature, cutting things that drag is somewhat necessary. --PolarisDiB

    After seeing this movie again today and thinking back at the time when i first watch it on VHS back in 95 ,do i realize it is part guilty of me wanted to try out dope for the first time!!(gladly kicked that habit). This is a classic road movie with the right Tarrantino feel . Its about two sweethearts on the run from the law & some creepy speed freaks after the two companions Watty Watts(Gill Bellows)and Billy Mack Black(Rory Cochrane) attending in a robbery gone bad. Good entertainment and good Texacan dialogs . It clearly an underestimated movie that should get much more credit that it has received . This is also one of Ren&eacute;e Zellweger first major movie role.
