 <sinopse>
  Thrown out by his girlfriend from her apartment, Axel lives for a while with Norbert, a gay man he met some days before.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Axel, a handsome young guy is always on the hunt for women although he already has a girlfriend, Doro. One day he is caught in the act with another woman by Doro and she quits the relationship and throws him out of her apartment. Seeking for a new home, Axel is introduced to Walter, a homosexual, who finds Axel quite attractive. Walter takes Axel to a gay party where they meet Norbert, who has a big apartment and is more than willing to let Axel stay for a while because he thinks he can seduce him. Meanwhile, Doro finds out that she is pregnant from Axel and now she tries to get him back, not knowing that he lives among homosexuals now. This gives room for a lot of funny incidents between the gay world and the straight world. But will Doro get Axel back or will he stay with Norbert instead?

    There is only one reason to watch this film: sexy Til Schweiger. He has beauty and magnetism, besides being an extraordinary young actor with subtlety, understated power, and depth. Unfortunately, these qualities are all but lost in this heavy-handed comedy. It is beautifully shot but, considering its comedic intent, rather darkly so. The story and its underlying principles leave much to be desired. Handsome Axel (Schweiger) works in a 30's-style supper club, presumably to remind us of the wacky social farces of that period. Any illusions on that score end, however, when he gallantly accompanies an inviting woman into the bathroom for a quickie. His girlfriend Doro, in the next stall, informs him that they're through. Axel is a very pretty boy but, looking for a place to stay, he is rebuffed with varying degrees of vehemence by former girlfriends all too familiar with his womanizing. Alas, Axel's unfortunate coitus interruptus is the inauspicious high point of the movie, with the opening credits barely over. Axel is adopted by a group of 'thoughtful' gay men in his hour of need. Norbert, a middle-aged nebbish, gives him a place to stay in hopes that there is a 'maybe'. What ensues is a series of awkward and tasteless gags, mostly involving Axel's discomfort being around gays. Stereotypes abound, and no one comes off particularly well. The straight men are dorky, unattractive, and strangely mortified by the use of common euphemisms for breasts. The gay men are selfish, unattractive, and impossibly flamboyant (in case we miss the point). Doro is shrill, intolerant, and controlling. Axel is shallow, thoughtless, and virtually monosyllabic, but adorable . When Axel speaks of 'us normal men' we know where the film stands politically. The gay men appear in female attire much of the time, but speak in caricatured bass voices (in case we miss the point). Axel is deeply offended when cruised by a gay man in a gay disco; especially surprising as he asked the man for a light and directions to the bathroom, while hot, sweaty, and very sexy in a tight muscle shirt. 'Nuff said. The plot thickens  and so does the humor  when Doro finds that she is pregnant and decides to get Axel back. She finds him in her own bed with unsightly Norbert, disturbingly naked, in the middle of a very inept seduction. Despite this awkward reunion, Axel and Doro get married. Axel unceremoniously drops Norbert because his wife is 'allergic to gays' . The downward spiral continues unabated. Norbert, a strict vegetarian, hooks up with a repellent and humorless butcher, about whom the best one can say is that he has shaved every inch of his gross body. Axel cheats on Doro yet again, with a woman whose animal stimulants put him a coma. We finally hit rock bottom when Doro is bitch-slapped during one last bout of hysteria, and goes into labor. This is funny? Til Schweiger is scrumptious eye-candy, and looks stunning throughout the film in tight t-shirts, muscle shirts, open shirts, no shirt. Thank heavens for small mercies. But, in one unfortunate aesthetic choice after another, the odious older men appear in greater states of undress more often than the exquisite young man who makes this peculiar move worth watching. The ending has a nice feeling and suggests some reconciliation between Norbert and Axel. It's way too little, too late.

    Hello America! I really liked the comments and especially the one of Marie Hunter (FlaminRieRie) from Akron, Ohio. For me as a German it is very interesting to learn about the international reactions on this movie since it is really one of the best German movies of all time. Main Plot: It shows a straight man in the gay world. By coincidence he is learning about gay people, who "surprisingly" have the same problems and the same life as straight men (love, relationships, friendships etc...) No stereotypes such as promiscuous sex or so, but insights in typical gay behaviors, different gay groups and life in general. But it is also a funny story about the guy getting back to his girlfiend who thinks that he turned gay... Hillarios! For me, as a straight guy, it was a fantastic movie. I really hope that the subtitles are o.k., since a lot of translations of Hollywood movies or TV-series are badly made (e.g. FRIENDS: brilliant in English, but terrible German translation) Enjoy!

    Very funny and original, even if you don't speak German. A lot of the story and bits transcend language. I'm surprised that it has not yet been remade in the USA. The film is entitled "Maybe, Maybe Not" in English. This film also introduced me to two of the best actors in the industry-Katja Riemann and Til Schweiger. Katya Riemann also gives a stellar performance in the WWII Drama Rosenstrausse. A must-see! I can't wait to see her in the upcoming werewolf horror film "Blood & Chocolate"! Til is starting to appear in Engish speaking films like King Arthur and Deuce Bigalow 2. When will we see Katja in an English speaking role?!? Keep up the good work! Andrea G, Anchorage,Alaska

    This film is about a man's life turning upside down after spending the night in a gay man's house. This film is so funny! The acting is great, the two lead characters, Axel and Norbert are outstanding. Axel is a man who cannot say no to temptation. Norbert, is a secret admirer of Axel. He is cute and hilarious. Axel's wife, Doro, accidentally discovers her husband befriending Norbert. One coincidence after another, she becomes convinced of her husband's homosexuality. The plot is also very good. Though I can only catch German isolated phrases here and there, I still find the film entertaining. I laughed out loud many times. The sets are also decorated nicely, each of the apartments are set up so that they really feel like a home sweet home. Apart from being entertaining, it also promotes tolerance and diversity.

    Der Bewegte Mann (The "Moved" or "Compelled" man in German) is a fun, original, fast paced German gay comedy that was a rare hit with mainstream American audiences. The film follows the drama of straight hunky beefcake Axel (Til Schweiger) when he is befriended by a well meaning gay in Cologne, who offers him a place to stay when he is kicked out of his girlfriend's apartment. The film's pace is good and never boring complemented by the perfect soundtrack which is a mix of house and cute German Schlager tunes. The dialog is clever and quite easy to understand with a little German proficiency. A witty and savvy foreign comedy must-see.

    Because of Germany's past, one might end up believing that the German population never sees any incentive to be humorous. "Der Bewegte Mann" (called "Maybe...Maybe Not" in English) disproves that. Axel Feldheim (Til Schweiger) is thrown out by his girlfriend Doro (Katja Riemann) after she finds him cheating on her. He moves in with his gay friend Norbert Pommer (Joachim Krol). When Doro tries to talk to Axel and finds out accidentally that Norbert is gay...well you can probably figure that it leads to sort of a wacky predicament. Anyway, the point is that the Germans CAN be funny. In fact, I believe that this was the first internationally successful German comedy. And you can't go wrong with gay comedy. It's the kind of humor where you think: "Oh no...oh yes." Cool.

    I thought it was fine. Not exactly deep stuff, but entertaining. Everything must be taken in context, if possible, and this was based on a popular comic strip by Ralf Koenig -- I'm guessing he's gay, based on other stuff I've seen of his, so whether his work perpetuates stereotypes or is the honest humor of a member of the gay community is not so easy to say. Not for me, anyway. I found Germany in the mid-1990s to be more tolerant of homosexuals than my hometown in Amerika, but a lot has changed in the intervening years. Anyway, political incorrectness aside, I think of this as a light comedy about relationships, like another Soenke Wortmann films I've seen [Stadtgespraech]. For students of the German language, it was a wonderful opportunity to catch some slang and modern, conversational German that we don't see in deep, intellectual films based on historical or literary sources.

    I saw this film in Germany when it came out as I was living there at the time. It was one of the funniest films I ever saw. Some years later I got a subtitled copy back in England and was shocked at how unfunny it was when translated. Which goes to show that humour often only works in the language it was created in. That said, it is still a very unstylised view of culture clashes and a study of how far people are prepared to go when they aren't getting any sex. No one gets what they want by the end: the gay man doesn't get his straight friend; the straight man doesn't get his free-love lifestyle; the straight woman doesn't get her angry singledom. I guess the moral is that you can take the human out of their sexuality, but you can't take the sexuality out of the human. Trite, but it reflects the title of the film, referring to a proverbial fish out of water.

    I saw this movie a few months ago with my German class, and we were rolling on the floors. At first American audiences might be a little "on edge" when they hear about what the guy does, where he stays, and that he has no idea about the people he is staying with in the beginning. But after getting into it, you see that what he goes through is just so funny, and you can't believe that he didn't see it coming. Plus, the Bull Power is all the more reason to go see, or rent, the movie. I mean I can't believe that they didn't come up with this type of stuff in the U.S. I know a lot of people who would go out and buy it right now if they had the chance. My friends and I now have a fun time talking/joking with our teacher about the movie, and we randomly bring Red Bull energy drinks to class, just to make him laugh. It's a great movie, and everyone should see it. I loved it.

    Stupid little German sex comedy about hunky Til Schweiger living with gay Joachim Krol after girlfriend Katja Riemann catches him having sex with another girl. Then she discovers she's pregnant and wants him back. But Krol wants him too... On the plus side--the acting is good and Schweiger (who is very handsome with a great body) has frequent nude scenes. That's about it for positives. On the negative side--the movie is silly; reinforces the myth of gay men trying to seduce straight guys; also has us believe that all gay guys LOVE drag; ALSO tells us that gay guys are sex maniacs; demonizes the female characters and has no real ending. Also none of the comedy was even remotely funny. The only reason this seems to have been made is to show Schweiger out of his clothes as much as possible (but no frontal). Nothing wrong with that and he IS a good actor...but that's not enough to carry the movie. If you can sit through silly dialogue and the dumb plot to see Schweiger nude you won't be disappointed--otherwise you can skip it. However a previous poster did say the subtitles were badly done--that might be the problem. If I understood German I might like this better. However, as it stands, I can only give it a 3.
