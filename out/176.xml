    For every dozen sequels that aren't as good as their originals, there comes a badass flick like Aliens that not only is as good as alien, but better in every category. The Story of Aliens is that Ripley, still haunted and traumatized after the events of the first film, is asked by her employers: The Weyland- Yutani Corporation to take a squad of colonial marines to destroy a possible Xenomorph infestation there. The performances by everyone in the cast are compelling and memorable, especially from Sigourney Weaver as Ripley who puts on one of, if not the, best performances I have ever seen on film. The sound design is also equally commendable; nothing is quite as memorable to me as the sound of a marine's pulse rifle firing, or the screeching of Xenomorphs. Speaking of Xenomorphs, I love the angle that director James Cameron took with them. We get to see more of the inner workings of their hive, how they think how they fight together, their thought process, how intelligent they can be, and just how dangerous they truly are. The story is kind of familiar (Believe me, the idea of being trapped behind enemy lines isn't exactly new here) but I think that it works to the films advantage. It takes some of those familiar themes and adds a whole new layer to them and makes them fit into the alien universe. Like the previous film it takes the familiar Good vs Evil and adds a whole new dimension to it. A connection of Vietnam can also be made to this film (If you are reading this, please don't start a flame war) I mean think about it: We have over cocky, over confident, marines going into unknown territory to fight an enemy they don't quite understand, and are defeated by the enemy that uses unconventional tactics in battle. James Cameron even said that some of the designs (Weapons, ships, etc.) Were taken from the Vietnam War. The films also takes the uncanny high levels of tension from Alien and cranks it up to a thousand. The dialogue is some of the best in cinematic history, and the characters are great as well. Another thing that must be mentioned, I also really liked the relationship between Newt and Ripley. It is portrayed realistically and adds a whole new dimension to the character of Ellen Ripley. Don't worry, Newt isn't annoying or stupid for a kid. In fact, she is actually really smart and reacts with brains instead of brawn. Hell, she even helps save Ripley at some points. Aliens is a masterpiece. Great writing, special effects, amazing gripping story, good set design, great mood and tone, action, and horror all contribute to this being one of the best film of all time. F**k those that don't like this movie, whether or not Aliens is better than Alien can actually be debated till you're black and blue in the face. But what can't be debated is that Aliens is a not only a masterpiece of science-fiction, but also a masterpiece of cinema.

    When Ridley Scott's "Alien" came out in 1979, people were thrilled and scared out of their minds by it. One of those people was Writer/Director James Cameron. He was so enamored with the world of "Alien" he decided to write a sequel to it. Then, after his first major film, "The terminator," came out Fox immediately took his script and picked him as the director. What we have here is not only one of his best movies, but one of the greatest sequels of all time. The story begins 57 years after the first film, where Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is finally rescued in her pod. the planet where the alien colony was first discovered by her and her crew, is now mining planet LV-426, which has lost contact with Earth. She is brought on as a "consultant" to a battalion of Marines and a higher-up in the company to go investigate and establish contact once again. Once they get there though, our friends with the taste for human brains (multiplied by the hundreds this time around instead of one) destroy half of the group forcing the survivors to barricade themselves to fend off the vicious monsters. One of James Cameron's claims to fame is his ability to make his characters believable. This proof comes in the form of Ripley. Sigourney Weaver plays her brilliantly, as a driven, determined, and slightly pushy bad-ass, but with a tender side to it. its a challenge for her to fit in with others in this movie. Everything she once knew is gone, and she is still having night terrors and is physically scarred by her experiences with the alien on the Nostromo. Weaver was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress, which was/still is unheard of considering what genre this movie is in. Ripley also bonds with the only survivor of the colonists, a little girl nicknamed "Newt." Again, the bond that blossoms between the two is very believable. And the supporting cast is top notch. Each marine has a memorable personality, and eventually warm up to Ripley and begin to understand the gravity of their situation in this hell-hole. Even Bishop the Android (Lance Henriksen) is given a great personality, and on that Ripley has to learn to trust after her experiences with the evil Ash in the first film. What makes this film far different from "Alien" is instead of it being a straight up horror/suspense film, the action in this movie is turned up infinitely more, and for good use. Cameron is the master of action and he uses his skills here to a great degree. The action itself plays against a larger environment, expertly designed by Peter Lamont, with he help of artists Ron Cobb and Syd mead, two of the greatest graphic designers ever. Then there is the Alien Queen. WOW!! Created by the late great Stan Winston, the Alien Queen is one of the most menacing creatures in movie history. She is so believable in terms of movement and motivation, she leaps off the screen at us in the audience. the James Horner's music compliments everything. It is sparse, but when it comes on it's like a hammer that gets our attention and helps the story progress. "Bishop's Countdown" is now one of the most famous tracks and trailer cues ever written, and for good reason. The horror aspects, when they happen in the film, are absolutely superb. They are so graphic and well-timed that you feel like either screaming, or getting sick. But this is necessary blood and gore, as well as making you truly care about the characters and how it successfully creates a sense of unease over who will die and who will survive. This film is a classic film in the two big ones people go to see, horror and action. The directing is great, the acting is great, the action is beyond awesome. Check it out if you want to be truly given a big dose of adrenaline.

    In some ways this is a better movie than Alien. There are characters besides Ripley you become invested in in Aliens. But, you can't beat the suspense of Alien. Alien did a great job with the unexpected betrayal of the crew android, and Aliens did a great job using the new crew android as an ally. I don't know why, but in my mind I group the little girl, Newt, from Aliens in with the Ewoks from Return of the Jedi. I found Newt unnecessary -- yes, it did bring a new dimension to Ripley, but I don't think that we needed that new dimension. Kyle Reese from Terminator has a supporting role as a near-love interest. He didn't make it all the way through the movie, but he was very good here. The fight with the Queen was drawn out, but it understandably couldn't end very quickly. Whether or not you liked Alien, I recommend Aliens. But, I definitely don't recommend the following movies. I may watch the Alien cubed because Tywin Lannister is in it, but watch at your own risk -- I've never heard good things.

    There are very few sequels in cinema that have managed to surpass the originals in the reach of their appeal and overcome the expectations of the loyal, faithful fans of the original films. James Cameron's Aliens, somehow, exactly manages to do that by taking the original story of Ridley Scott's Alien and expanding upon it in ways most sequels are afraid to. Aliens is, without a doubt, one of the best sequels ever made and just like Alien, is one of the best offerings of its or any other genre. It is set in the same universe of Alien but is way more bigger & action-packed than the original and succeeds not only as a great sci-fi horror but also re-defines the action genre. Aliens is set 57 years after the events of the first film. It begins with Ripley being rescued & revived from hyper-sleep after drifting in space for more than 50 years. After hearing her account of what happened to her former crew on Nostromo, the panel board turns down her story, revokes her space-flight license & makes her aware of the colonization of the planet LV-426, where the alien spaceship was found in the first film. Things set in motion when the contact with the colony on planet LV-426 is lost and Ripley is requested to join a group of space marines to investigate which she, after initially refusing, finally accepts in order to face & overcome her fears. While Alien gave equal importance to each of its characters, Aliens places more emphasis on Ripley and is basically her journey from undergoing severe traumatic nightmares caused due to the events of the first film to facing her fears head on in this sequel. James Cameron is an extremely talented writer-director not because he knows what great action is all about but because he's always able to back it up with a highly compelling story which is further elevated by jaw-dropping visuals. Coming from the success of The Terminator, Cameron could have easily made a loose sequel of Alien by repeating the concept of the first film but chose to do it differently by expanding the universe of the previous film and giving an insight into the evolution of the creatures as well as Ripley. While Alien was a slow building masterpiece of atmospheric tension, Aliens travels the same road to some extent but then takes a slightly different turn by replacing the survival horror of its predecessor with a highly intense, bombastic & violent war between two species, unlike anything that existed before it. There is less suspense in this film than Alien, but Cameron makes up for it by turning Aliens into an action-thriller filled with intense moments of relentless terror, highly potent combat sequences and finally culminates the story with a bone-chilling climax. The part of Ellen Ripley is brilliantly written by Cameron. He penned down Sigourney Weaver's character with extreme care & provided much more depth to Ripley. Also, her relationship with Newt in this film gave Weaver new emotional dimensions to explore. With such a layered canvas crafted by Cameron to build upon, Weaver was able to capitalize and ended up giving a truly remarkable performance, thus becoming the first real female action figure in cinema. Supporting her are other excellent performances too, especially by Carrie Henn as Newt, a traumatized young girl who is the only former survivor on the colonized planet and with whom Ripley forms a motherly bond. Lance Henriksen provides his very own dimensions to the character of Bishop, the android. The space marines have their bad-ass attitude in tact and each one of them is given a distinct trait. And the team of Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton & others did a commendable job in portraying them on-screen. Solid performances all around. As for this film's technical achievements, Aliens' art direction & set designs may not have surpassed the artistic levels set in the previous film but it certainly comes close. However, the one category where this film sets a new benchmark of its time is in its state-of-the-art visual & sound effects. Visual effects are absolutely groundbreaking and that's one part which has since become a trademark in James Cameron's films. Sound always plays a big role in combat & horror films and is impressive here as well, be it the sound of guns blazing, aliens shrieking or explosions. Cinematography successfully creates a more evolved atmosphere of what existed in the original film. Editing is cleverly done & it successfully manages to keep the viewers gripped to their seats for 2.5 hours which goes pretty unnoticed. And finally, the score perfectly balances the tone of the film and stays in sync with the film's content. It's loud, terrifying, suspenseful & also touching wherever & whenever it's supposed to be. Splendid work by composer James Horner. Even though many fans will be divided over which is a better film between Ridley Scott's Alien & James Cameron's Aliens, there is no denying that both films are masterpieces & immortal for their contribution to horror, action & science-fiction genres. And looking back, Aliens is indeed a perfect follow-up to Alien, not just because it explores the elements of the original beautifully, but also because it places greater emphasis on staying true to the original by following it up with an equally mesmerizing story rather than something made just for financial gains, like most sequels of today. Highly entertaining, immensely satisfying & a spectacular roller-coaster ride of non-stop action, Aliens refuses to age even after three decades and continues to rank amongst the most intense & fulfilling pieces of action films, ever. And a final note to whoever is reading this: Although Aliens is strong enough to be a standalone film, it still would be a wiser move to visit the original by Ridley Scott before moving on to this one. And just like Alien, James Cameron's Aliens is strongly recommended as well.

    James Cameron took over directing duties from Ridley Scott, and like the original, directs this with remarkable intensity and suspense, as Ripley is rescued from her hyper sleep, and later persuaded to return to the same alien planet where all that horror she left behind comes back multiplied, after a colony stumbles upon the same derelict ship, and comes into contact with the merciless alien creatures... A model on how to produce a sequel; continue the original, building on the plot without repeating it, while at the same time respecting the past, and putting your own stamp on things. Just like the first, this is extremely effective in story, character development, and excitement, building to an action-packed and satisfying climax. One of the finest sequels ever made!

    There is no doubt that James Cameron is a master film maker with such classic films as Terminator 1 & 2 and True Lies under his belt (which are all personal favourites of mine). He also created Aliens which is a near perfect follow up to the popular 1979 film Alien. The film begins with a salvage crew discovering a ship which Ripley (Weaver) has been drifting in for 57 years as a result of being in some sort of hyper sleep. She still has her beloved cat Jonesey from the first film who presumably must have been in a hyper sleep as well. We quickly learn that in the 57 years that Ripley has been asleep (I think only Sleeping Beauty has slept for longer than that)that there have been colonies of families that have been studying the planet where Ripley's crew discovered the Alien life forms in the first film. When contact becomes lost with the colony, a group of marines are sent in to investigate what's been going on - this is initially done as a precaution as they suspect that contact has been lost due to a faulty transmitter. Upon hearing this, Ripley isn't convinced that a faulty transmitter is to blame and she suspects that there is a possibility that the Aliens may have re-surfaced. This leads to Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) and Lt Gorman (William Hope) asking Ripley to join them as a 'consultant' as she is more knowledgeable about the Aliens and they believe that if they are out there, that she will be the best person to assist the Marines in eradicating the Aliens for good. I think there are 2 main reasons why this works better than Alien. Firstly, the pacing; Aliens gets going a lot more quickly than Alien and never dragged or became dull - this was part of the problem with Alien - the action scenes were good in Alien, but the first 45 minutes were a complete bore. Second was the action scenes - James Cameron is just so much better at creating action sequences which ultimately made Aliens a much more exciting film. One thing that was great about Alien was the direction and the way the tension was created, but James Cameron even with the faster pacing and better action sequences still managed to create arguably greater tension and even crisper direction (but what did you expect from the mastermind behind the excellent original Terminator and the masterpiece of Terminator 2 that followed). The only minor gripe that I had was the character of Hudson (portrayed by Bill Paxton). Whilst Paxton's acting was great, his character was really annoying with his constant whining and repeatedly saying 'Man' at the end of every sentence. Other than that, I will happily sing this film's praises! Whilst Aliens is undoubtedly a better film than Alien, I would recommend watching Alien before Aliens as you will have a better understanding of the themes contained in Aliens.

    This movie made such an impact on me when I saw it as a teen in 1987. That's because of the powerful story, strong characters that you care about and lots of fast paced action. And of course a truckload of one-liners (mostly from Hudson/Bill Paxton), which I still remember to this day. You can say this movie changed my life. Leave it to James Cameron to make a sequel to a classic sci-fi horror film and turn it into a action movie, that's just as good (even better I think). It ages well, even though some technology is outdated now. One of the greatest science fiction action movies ever. PS: And i'll never watch Alien 3 again. What it did to the surviving characters was unforgiving.

    People often argue the merits and their personal preference for Alien or Aliens, but not even a 57 year debate wouldn't settle that argument. I'm just glad we have two such great (and different) films to enjoy. For my two cents, although I love Alien, it's Aliens that I've comfortably watched more times. It's like a great roller coaster, once you catch a glimpse of it you need to hop on board, strap in, and enjoy the ride. Cameron was never (nor should he) going to outdo Ridley in terms of mood and atmosphere. So Cameron played to his strengths and changed gears (breaking a transaxle in the process, sorry!). What we're left with is a film that sits happily in (and adds to) the universe that Ridley and Co. so beautifully created and ranks as once of greatest action/sci-fi films ever, and certainly my favourite. So go (re)watch it!

    Ridley Scott's "Alien" was a classic sci-fi horror film. He used claustrophobic sets and atmosphere to create a creepy, modern monster film. James Cameron's "Aliens," however, is a great sci-fi action film. Both films benefit from having competent directors at the helm. Both directors take a different approach to the material, which lends each film a unique feel. We never feel like we just watched the same movie twice, nor that we saw an inferior spin-off of the first--common complaints about sequels. "Aliens" is a self-contained story. (I actually saw "Aliens" before I saw "Alien"... back in the third grade. My parents were cool like that.) The action picks up 57 years after the events in the first film. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has been in hibernation since her first ordeal with the alien. Her story of the alien is met with derision, and her bosses demote her for blowing up her ship, the Nostromo. Ripley is horrified to learn colonists have been living on the planet where her crew encountered the alien for 20 years. However, when contact breaks off with the colonists, Ripley is sent in with the Marines as a consultant to confront the aliens. The Marines find the colony devoid of life, except for one little girl, Newt, who has managed to survive by hiding in the vents. Lesser films use children as a cheap device to force the audience to care about the outcome of the story. Here, the relationship between Ripley and Newt is pivotal to showing Ripley's maternal side, which is essential to the development of the character. Cameron takes his time setting up the story and building suspense. Almost an hour passes before the first encounter with the aliens. The set-up can be perfunctory at times, with dialogue between the Marines seemingly copy-and-pasted from "Full Metal Jacket." From the midway point, however, the action doesn't let up. We sat through the slow ride to the top of the roller coaster, and it is all thrills until the end. This film is now 27 years old and was so popular that if you're reading this, you probably have already seen it. I will instead write about one of the themes of the Alien franchise that I find interesting in understanding the films. Much has been written about how the franchise is actually about rape. However, I will write about the series's feminist undertones. My Western Civ teacher at the University of Kansas, John Younger, lectured about how the feminist movement can be traced through the series. "Alien" was released in '70s, a time when the feminist movement was in its most militant phase. Ripley, a butch female, single-handedly destroys the alien (which has a penis-shaped head and penis-like extremities protruding from its body). This was after it had already killed all her male companions, proving that "women need men the way fish need bicycles." "Aliens" came out in '80s, when feminists began to embrace their femininity. We see this in the motherly role Ripley adopts toward Newt. Ripley goes alone with a pulse rifle taped to a grenade launcher to rescue Newt from the alien queen. "Alien 3" came out in '90s, when the feminist movement became more inclusive, and progressive men could actually be considered feminists. In the third installment, the men of the penal colony work together with Ripley to destroy the alien. As for the subsequent movies, it's better to just mentally erase them. The films also celebrate Native American art. Alien creator H.R. Giger was a great admirer of pre-Columbian art, and based the alien design partly on the stone reliefs of the Chav&iacute;n culture, a pre-Inca Andean society. One creature in Chav&iacute;n art is notably depicted with a mouth within its mouth. Considering these things adds layers of appreciation for the viewers. Ultimately, "Aliens" works because the filmmakers set out to make a good movie, rather than crank out a sequel simply to cash in on the success of its predecessor.

    'Aliens' came out in 1986, so the quality of it won't be as good as a movie coming out today. I'm not giving this movie any special treatment for that. I'm reviewing and rating it just like I would rate and review a movie that would come out now. Anyway, there are two types of people in the world: people who think 'Alien' is better than 'Aliens', and people who think 'Aliens' is better than 'Alien'. I don't think either of them is better than another. I watched the 1990 special addition of the movie, so it's two and a half hours long. 'Aliens' had a very slow first hour of the movie. It worked for only about twenty minutes. The movie then started dragging on for the other forty minutes. In the first twenty minutes, it was alright because the slowness hadn't gotten boring yet, it was just used to introduce new characters and go over the situation at hand. This part of the first hour was enjoyable. As it went on, though, we had already known all of the characters and there was just nothing going on. There was quite a bit of CGI used near the end of the first hour, which I think they could gone without using, because it was two-dimensional CGI. There were also green screens used, which also brought it down. That was part of the reason the forty minute boring part was bad. The other part of the reason is that it was simply unexciting. The acting in this movie had a few problems, too. A few of the actors didn't seem to give it their all. Luckily, the main actors and actresses (Sigourney Weaver, Carrie Henn, and Michael Biehn) did well. I believed those three actors and actresses were their characters. The supposed cast weren't all very good, though. In several scenes of this movie, the characters would have to be quiet to get through places, and there was no music in these parts. This made suspense build up to set up for action sequences. They executed this well in the film. It made trauma for the audience and even some intensity. That worked in the movie. They also didn't just have mindless acting in the movie. Every sequence had a reason for it's happening, which just made it more enjoyable. That brings up the quality of the acting sequences. The acting sequences were great. They had alright music for the situations and had very thrilling humans vs. aliens battle scenes. There were used of guns which brought more explosions that just made it more thrilling. Also, the humans didn't just win every time. There was an equal balance of aliens winning, too. This made the movie more thrilling and intense. It wouldn't have been good if the humans won every time. The technology used in that time period wasn't too far- fetched, either. Overall, this movie was really good. That's what my 8/10 rating means. I very much recommend 'Alien' and 'Aliens' to anyone who is thinking about watching it. I own the movie on Blu-Ray.

    For every dozen sequels that aren't as good as their originals, there comes a badass flick like Aliens that not only is as good as alien, but better in every category. The Story of Aliens is that Ripley, still haunted and traumatized after the events of the first film, is asked by her employers: The Weyland- Yutani Corporation to take a squad of colonial marines to destroy a possible Xenomorph infestation there. The performances by everyone in the cast are compelling and memorable, especially from Sigourney Weaver as Ripley who puts on one of, if not the, best performances I have ever seen on film. The sound design is also equally commendable; nothing is quite as memorable to me as the sound of a marine's pulse rifle firing, or the screeching of Xenomorphs. Speaking of Xenomorphs, I love the angle that director James Cameron took with them. We get to see more of the inner workings of their hive, how they think how they fight together, their thought process, how intelligent they can be, and just how dangerous they truly are. The story is kind of familiar (Believe me, the idea of being trapped behind enemy lines isn't exactly new here) but I think that it works to the films advantage. It takes some of those familiar themes and adds a whole new layer to them and makes them fit into the alien universe. Like the previous film it takes the familiar Good vs Evil and adds a whole new dimension to it. A connection of Vietnam can also be made to this film (If you are reading this, please don't start a flame war) I mean think about it: We have over cocky, over confident, marines going into unknown territory to fight an enemy they don't quite understand, and are defeated by the enemy that uses unconventional tactics in battle. James Cameron even said that some of the designs (Weapons, ships, etc.) Were taken from the Vietnam War. The films also takes the uncanny high levels of tension from Alien and cranks it up to a thousand. The dialogue is some of the best in cinematic history, and the characters are great as well. Another thing that must be mentioned, I also really liked the relationship between Newt and Ripley. It is portrayed realistically and adds a whole new dimension to the character of Ellen Ripley. Don't worry, Newt isn't annoying or stupid for a kid. In fact, she is actually really smart and reacts with brains instead of brawn. Hell, she even helps save Ripley at some points. Aliens is a masterpiece. Great writing, special effects, amazing gripping story, good set design, great mood and tone, action, and horror all contribute to this being one of the best film of all time. F**k those that don't like this movie, whether or not Aliens is better than Alien can actually be debated till you're black and blue in the face. But what can't be debated is that Aliens is a not only a masterpiece of science-fiction, but also a masterpiece of cinema.

    When Ridley Scott's "Alien" came out in 1979, people were thrilled and scared out of their minds by it. One of those people was Writer/Director James Cameron. He was so enamored with the world of "Alien" he decided to write a sequel to it. Then, after his first major film, "The terminator," came out Fox immediately took his script and picked him as the director. What we have here is not only one of his best movies, but one of the greatest sequels of all time. The story begins 57 years after the first film, where Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is finally rescued in her pod. the planet where the alien colony was first discovered by her and her crew, is now mining planet LV-426, which has lost contact with Earth. She is brought on as a "consultant" to a battalion of Marines and a higher-up in the company to go investigate and establish contact once again. Once they get there though, our friends with the taste for human brains (multiplied by the hundreds this time around instead of one) destroy half of the group forcing the survivors to barricade themselves to fend off the vicious monsters. One of James Cameron's claims to fame is his ability to make his characters believable. This proof comes in the form of Ripley. Sigourney Weaver plays her brilliantly, as a driven, determined, and slightly pushy bad-ass, but with a tender side to it. its a challenge for her to fit in with others in this movie. Everything she once knew is gone, and she is still having night terrors and is physically scarred by her experiences with the alien on the Nostromo. Weaver was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress, which was/still is unheard of considering what genre this movie is in. Ripley also bonds with the only survivor of the colonists, a little girl nicknamed "Newt." Again, the bond that blossoms between the two is very believable. And the supporting cast is top notch. Each marine has a memorable personality, and eventually warm up to Ripley and begin to understand the gravity of their situation in this hell-hole. Even Bishop the Android (Lance Henriksen) is given a great personality, and on that Ripley has to learn to trust after her experiences with the evil Ash in the first film. What makes this film far different from "Alien" is instead of it being a straight up horror/suspense film, the action in this movie is turned up infinitely more, and for good use. Cameron is the master of action and he uses his skills here to a great degree. The action itself plays against a larger environment, expertly designed by Peter Lamont, with he help of artists Ron Cobb and Syd mead, two of the greatest graphic designers ever. Then there is the Alien Queen. WOW!! Created by the late great Stan Winston, the Alien Queen is one of the most menacing creatures in movie history. She is so believable in terms of movement and motivation, she leaps off the screen at us in the audience. the James Horner's music compliments everything. It is sparse, but when it comes on it's like a hammer that gets our attention and helps the story progress. "Bishop's Countdown" is now one of the most famous tracks and trailer cues ever written, and for good reason. The horror aspects, when they happen in the film, are absolutely superb. They are so graphic and well-timed that you feel like either screaming, or getting sick. But this is necessary blood and gore, as well as making you truly care about the characters and how it successfully creates a sense of unease over who will die and who will survive. This film is a classic film in the two big ones people go to see, horror and action. The directing is great, the acting is great, the action is beyond awesome. Check it out if you want to be truly given a big dose of adrenaline.

    In some ways this is a better movie than Alien. There are characters besides Ripley you become invested in in Aliens. But, you can't beat the suspense of Alien. Alien did a great job with the unexpected betrayal of the crew android, and Aliens did a great job using the new crew android as an ally. I don't know why, but in my mind I group the little girl, Newt, from Aliens in with the Ewoks from Return of the Jedi. I found Newt unnecessary -- yes, it did bring a new dimension to Ripley, but I don't think that we needed that new dimension. Kyle Reese from Terminator has a supporting role as a near-love interest. He didn't make it all the way through the movie, but he was very good here. The fight with the Queen was drawn out, but it understandably couldn't end very quickly. Whether or not you liked Alien, I recommend Aliens. But, I definitely don't recommend the following movies. I may watch the Alien cubed because Tywin Lannister is in it, but watch at your own risk -- I've never heard good things.

    There are very few sequels in cinema that have managed to surpass the originals in the reach of their appeal and overcome the expectations of the loyal, faithful fans of the original films. James Cameron's Aliens, somehow, exactly manages to do that by taking the original story of Ridley Scott's Alien and expanding upon it in ways most sequels are afraid to. Aliens is, without a doubt, one of the best sequels ever made and just like Alien, is one of the best offerings of its or any other genre. It is set in the same universe of Alien but is way more bigger & action-packed than the original and succeeds not only as a great sci-fi horror but also re-defines the action genre. Aliens is set 57 years after the events of the first film. It begins with Ripley being rescued & revived from hyper-sleep after drifting in space for more than 50 years. After hearing her account of what happened to her former crew on Nostromo, the panel board turns down her story, revokes her space-flight license & makes her aware of the colonization of the planet LV-426, where the alien spaceship was found in the first film. Things set in motion when the contact with the colony on planet LV-426 is lost and Ripley is requested to join a group of space marines to investigate which she, after initially refusing, finally accepts in order to face & overcome her fears. While Alien gave equal importance to each of its characters, Aliens places more emphasis on Ripley and is basically her journey from undergoing severe traumatic nightmares caused due to the events of the first film to facing her fears head on in this sequel. James Cameron is an extremely talented writer-director not because he knows what great action is all about but because he's always able to back it up with a highly compelling story which is further elevated by jaw-dropping visuals. Coming from the success of The Terminator, Cameron could have easily made a loose sequel of Alien by repeating the concept of the first film but chose to do it differently by expanding the universe of the previous film and giving an insight into the evolution of the creatures as well as Ripley. While Alien was a slow building masterpiece of atmospheric tension, Aliens travels the same road to some extent but then takes a slightly different turn by replacing the survival horror of its predecessor with a highly intense, bombastic & violent war between two species, unlike anything that existed before it. There is less suspense in this film than Alien, but Cameron makes up for it by turning Aliens into an action-thriller filled with intense moments of relentless terror, highly potent combat sequences and finally culminates the story with a bone-chilling climax. The part of Ellen Ripley is brilliantly written by Cameron. He penned down Sigourney Weaver's character with extreme care & provided much more depth to Ripley. Also, her relationship with Newt in this film gave Weaver new emotional dimensions to explore. With such a layered canvas crafted by Cameron to build upon, Weaver was able to capitalize and ended up giving a truly remarkable performance, thus becoming the first real female action figure in cinema. Supporting her are other excellent performances too, especially by Carrie Henn as Newt, a traumatized young girl who is the only former survivor on the colonized planet and with whom Ripley forms a motherly bond. Lance Henriksen provides his very own dimensions to the character of Bishop, the android. The space marines have their bad-ass attitude in tact and each one of them is given a distinct trait. And the team of Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton & others did a commendable job in portraying them on-screen. Solid performances all around. As for this film's technical achievements, Aliens' art direction & set designs may not have surpassed the artistic levels set in the previous film but it certainly comes close. However, the one category where this film sets a new benchmark of its time is in its state-of-the-art visual & sound effects. Visual effects are absolutely groundbreaking and that's one part which has since become a trademark in James Cameron's films. Sound always plays a big role in combat & horror films and is impressive here as well, be it the sound of guns blazing, aliens shrieking or explosions. Cinematography successfully creates a more evolved atmosphere of what existed in the original film. Editing is cleverly done & it successfully manages to keep the viewers gripped to their seats for 2.5 hours which goes pretty unnoticed. And finally, the score perfectly balances the tone of the film and stays in sync with the film's content. It's loud, terrifying, suspenseful & also touching wherever & whenever it's supposed to be. Splendid work by composer James Horner. Even though many fans will be divided over which is a better film between Ridley Scott's Alien & James Cameron's Aliens, there is no denying that both films are masterpieces & immortal for their contribution to horror, action & science-fiction genres. And looking back, Aliens is indeed a perfect follow-up to Alien, not just because it explores the elements of the original beautifully, but also because it places greater emphasis on staying true to the original by following it up with an equally mesmerizing story rather than something made just for financial gains, like most sequels of today. Highly entertaining, immensely satisfying & a spectacular roller-coaster ride of non-stop action, Aliens refuses to age even after three decades and continues to rank amongst the most intense & fulfilling pieces of action films, ever. And a final note to whoever is reading this: Although Aliens is strong enough to be a standalone film, it still would be a wiser move to visit the original by Ridley Scott before moving on to this one. And just like Alien, James Cameron's Aliens is strongly recommended as well.

    James Cameron took over directing duties from Ridley Scott, and like the original, directs this with remarkable intensity and suspense, as Ripley is rescued from her hyper sleep, and later persuaded to return to the same alien planet where all that horror she left behind comes back multiplied, after a colony stumbles upon the same derelict ship, and comes into contact with the merciless alien creatures... A model on how to produce a sequel; continue the original, building on the plot without repeating it, while at the same time respecting the past, and putting your own stamp on things. Just like the first, this is extremely effective in story, character development, and excitement, building to an action-packed and satisfying climax. One of the finest sequels ever made!

    There is no doubt that James Cameron is a master film maker with such classic films as Terminator 1 & 2 and True Lies under his belt (which are all personal favourites of mine). He also created Aliens which is a near perfect follow up to the popular 1979 film Alien. The film begins with a salvage crew discovering a ship which Ripley (Weaver) has been drifting in for 57 years as a result of being in some sort of hyper sleep. She still has her beloved cat Jonesey from the first film who presumably must have been in a hyper sleep as well. We quickly learn that in the 57 years that Ripley has been asleep (I think only Sleeping Beauty has slept for longer than that)that there have been colonies of families that have been studying the planet where Ripley's crew discovered the Alien life forms in the first film. When contact becomes lost with the colony, a group of marines are sent in to investigate what's been going on - this is initially done as a precaution as they suspect that contact has been lost due to a faulty transmitter. Upon hearing this, Ripley isn't convinced that a faulty transmitter is to blame and she suspects that there is a possibility that the Aliens may have re-surfaced. This leads to Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) and Lt Gorman (William Hope) asking Ripley to join them as a 'consultant' as she is more knowledgeable about the Aliens and they believe that if they are out there, that she will be the best person to assist the Marines in eradicating the Aliens for good. I think there are 2 main reasons why this works better than Alien. Firstly, the pacing; Aliens gets going a lot more quickly than Alien and never dragged or became dull - this was part of the problem with Alien - the action scenes were good in Alien, but the first 45 minutes were a complete bore. Second was the action scenes - James Cameron is just so much better at creating action sequences which ultimately made Aliens a much more exciting film. One thing that was great about Alien was the direction and the way the tension was created, but James Cameron even with the faster pacing and better action sequences still managed to create arguably greater tension and even crisper direction (but what did you expect from the mastermind behind the excellent original Terminator and the masterpiece of Terminator 2 that followed). The only minor gripe that I had was the character of Hudson (portrayed by Bill Paxton). Whilst Paxton's acting was great, his character was really annoying with his constant whining and repeatedly saying 'Man' at the end of every sentence. Other than that, I will happily sing this film's praises! Whilst Aliens is undoubtedly a better film than Alien, I would recommend watching Alien before Aliens as you will have a better understanding of the themes contained in Aliens.

    This movie made such an impact on me when I saw it as a teen in 1987. That's because of the powerful story, strong characters that you care about and lots of fast paced action. And of course a truckload of one-liners (mostly from Hudson/Bill Paxton), which I still remember to this day. You can say this movie changed my life. Leave it to James Cameron to make a sequel to a classic sci-fi horror film and turn it into a action movie, that's just as good (even better I think). It ages well, even though some technology is outdated now. One of the greatest science fiction action movies ever. PS: And i'll never watch Alien 3 again. What it did to the surviving characters was unforgiving.

    People often argue the merits and their personal preference for Alien or Aliens, but not even a 57 year debate wouldn't settle that argument. I'm just glad we have two such great (and different) films to enjoy. For my two cents, although I love Alien, it's Aliens that I've comfortably watched more times. It's like a great roller coaster, once you catch a glimpse of it you need to hop on board, strap in, and enjoy the ride. Cameron was never (nor should he) going to outdo Ridley in terms of mood and atmosphere. So Cameron played to his strengths and changed gears (breaking a transaxle in the process, sorry!). What we're left with is a film that sits happily in (and adds to) the universe that Ridley and Co. so beautifully created and ranks as once of greatest action/sci-fi films ever, and certainly my favourite. So go (re)watch it!

    Ridley Scott's "Alien" was a classic sci-fi horror film. He used claustrophobic sets and atmosphere to create a creepy, modern monster film. James Cameron's "Aliens," however, is a great sci-fi action film. Both films benefit from having competent directors at the helm. Both directors take a different approach to the material, which lends each film a unique feel. We never feel like we just watched the same movie twice, nor that we saw an inferior spin-off of the first--common complaints about sequels. "Aliens" is a self-contained story. (I actually saw "Aliens" before I saw "Alien"... back in the third grade. My parents were cool like that.) The action picks up 57 years after the events in the first film. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has been in hibernation since her first ordeal with the alien. Her story of the alien is met with derision, and her bosses demote her for blowing up her ship, the Nostromo. Ripley is horrified to learn colonists have been living on the planet where her crew encountered the alien for 20 years. However, when contact breaks off with the colonists, Ripley is sent in with the Marines as a consultant to confront the aliens. The Marines find the colony devoid of life, except for one little girl, Newt, who has managed to survive by hiding in the vents. Lesser films use children as a cheap device to force the audience to care about the outcome of the story. Here, the relationship between Ripley and Newt is pivotal to showing Ripley's maternal side, which is essential to the development of the character. Cameron takes his time setting up the story and building suspense. Almost an hour passes before the first encounter with the aliens. The set-up can be perfunctory at times, with dialogue between the Marines seemingly copy-and-pasted from "Full Metal Jacket." From the midway point, however, the action doesn't let up. We sat through the slow ride to the top of the roller coaster, and it is all thrills until the end. This film is now 27 years old and was so popular that if you're reading this, you probably have already seen it. I will instead write about one of the themes of the Alien franchise that I find interesting in understanding the films. Much has been written about how the franchise is actually about rape. However, I will write about the series's feminist undertones. My Western Civ teacher at the University of Kansas, John Younger, lectured about how the feminist movement can be traced through the series. "Alien" was released in '70s, a time when the feminist movement was in its most militant phase. Ripley, a butch female, single-handedly destroys the alien (which has a penis-shaped head and penis-like extremities protruding from its body). This was after it had already killed all her male companions, proving that "women need men the way fish need bicycles." "Aliens" came out in '80s, when feminists began to embrace their femininity. We see this in the motherly role Ripley adopts toward Newt. Ripley goes alone with a pulse rifle taped to a grenade launcher to rescue Newt from the alien queen. "Alien 3" came out in '90s, when the feminist movement became more inclusive, and progressive men could actually be considered feminists. In the third installment, the men of the penal colony work together with Ripley to destroy the alien. As for the subsequent movies, it's better to just mentally erase them. The films also celebrate Native American art. Alien creator H.R. Giger was a great admirer of pre-Columbian art, and based the alien design partly on the stone reliefs of the Chav&iacute;n culture, a pre-Inca Andean society. One creature in Chav&iacute;n art is notably depicted with a mouth within its mouth. Considering these things adds layers of appreciation for the viewers. Ultimately, "Aliens" works because the filmmakers set out to make a good movie, rather than crank out a sequel simply to cash in on the success of its predecessor.

    'Aliens' came out in 1986, so the quality of it won't be as good as a movie coming out today. I'm not giving this movie any special treatment for that. I'm reviewing and rating it just like I would rate and review a movie that would come out now. Anyway, there are two types of people in the world: people who think 'Alien' is better than 'Aliens', and people who think 'Aliens' is better than 'Alien'. I don't think either of them is better than another. I watched the 1990 special addition of the movie, so it's two and a half hours long. 'Aliens' had a very slow first hour of the movie. It worked for only about twenty minutes. The movie then started dragging on for the other forty minutes. In the first twenty minutes, it was alright because the slowness hadn't gotten boring yet, it was just used to introduce new characters and go over the situation at hand. This part of the first hour was enjoyable. As it went on, though, we had already known all of the characters and there was just nothing going on. There was quite a bit of CGI used near the end of the first hour, which I think they could gone without using, because it was two-dimensional CGI. There were also green screens used, which also brought it down. That was part of the reason the forty minute boring part was bad. The other part of the reason is that it was simply unexciting. The acting in this movie had a few problems, too. A few of the actors didn't seem to give it their all. Luckily, the main actors and actresses (Sigourney Weaver, Carrie Henn, and Michael Biehn) did well. I believed those three actors and actresses were their characters. The supposed cast weren't all very good, though. In several scenes of this movie, the characters would have to be quiet to get through places, and there was no music in these parts. This made suspense build up to set up for action sequences. They executed this well in the film. It made trauma for the audience and even some intensity. That worked in the movie. They also didn't just have mindless acting in the movie. Every sequence had a reason for it's happening, which just made it more enjoyable. That brings up the quality of the acting sequences. The acting sequences were great. They had alright music for the situations and had very thrilling humans vs. aliens battle scenes. There were used of guns which brought more explosions that just made it more thrilling. Also, the humans didn't just win every time. There was an equal balance of aliens winning, too. This made the movie more thrilling and intense. It wouldn't have been good if the humans won every time. The technology used in that time period wasn't too far- fetched, either. Overall, this movie was really good. That's what my 8/10 rating means. I very much recommend 'Alien' and 'Aliens' to anyone who is thinking about watching it. I own the movie on Blu-Ray.

    For every dozen sequels that aren't as good as their originals, there comes a badass flick like Aliens that not only is as good as alien, but better in every category. The Story of Aliens is that Ripley, still haunted and traumatized after the events of the first film, is asked by her employers: The Weyland- Yutani Corporation to take a squad of colonial marines to destroy a possible Xenomorph infestation there. The performances by everyone in the cast are compelling and memorable, especially from Sigourney Weaver as Ripley who puts on one of, if not the, best performances I have ever seen on film. The sound design is also equally commendable; nothing is quite as memorable to me as the sound of a marine's pulse rifle firing, or the screeching of Xenomorphs. Speaking of Xenomorphs, I love the angle that director James Cameron took with them. We get to see more of the inner workings of their hive, how they think how they fight together, their thought process, how intelligent they can be, and just how dangerous they truly are. The story is kind of familiar (Believe me, the idea of being trapped behind enemy lines isn't exactly new here) but I think that it works to the films advantage. It takes some of those familiar themes and adds a whole new layer to them and makes them fit into the alien universe. Like the previous film it takes the familiar Good vs Evil and adds a whole new dimension to it. A connection of Vietnam can also be made to this film (If you are reading this, please don't start a flame war) I mean think about it: We have over cocky, over confident, marines going into unknown territory to fight an enemy they don't quite understand, and are defeated by the enemy that uses unconventional tactics in battle. James Cameron even said that some of the designs (Weapons, ships, etc.) Were taken from the Vietnam War. The films also takes the uncanny high levels of tension from Alien and cranks it up to a thousand. The dialogue is some of the best in cinematic history, and the characters are great as well. Another thing that must be mentioned, I also really liked the relationship between Newt and Ripley. It is portrayed realistically and adds a whole new dimension to the character of Ellen Ripley. Don't worry, Newt isn't annoying or stupid for a kid. In fact, she is actually really smart and reacts with brains instead of brawn. Hell, she even helps save Ripley at some points. Aliens is a masterpiece. Great writing, special effects, amazing gripping story, good set design, great mood and tone, action, and horror all contribute to this being one of the best film of all time. F**k those that don't like this movie, whether or not Aliens is better than Alien can actually be debated till you're black and blue in the face. But what can't be debated is that Aliens is a not only a masterpiece of science-fiction, but also a masterpiece of cinema.

He was so enamored with the world of "Alien" he decided to write a sequel to it. Then, after his first major film, "The terminator," came out Fox immediately took his script and picked him as the director. What we have here is not only one of his best movies, but one of the greatest sequels of all time. The story begins 57 years after the first film, where Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is finally rescued in her pod. the planet where the alien colony was first discovered by her and her crew, is now mining planet LV-426, which has lost contact with Earth. She is brought on as a "consultant" to a battalion of Marines and a higher-up in the company to go investigate and establish contact once again. Once they get there though, our friends with the taste for human brains (multiplied by the hundreds this time around instead of one) destroy half of the group forcing the survivors to barricade themselves to fend off the vicious monsters. One of James Cameron's claims to fame is his ability to make his characters believable. This proof comes in the form of Ripley. Sigourney Weaver plays her brilliantly, as a driven, determined, and slightly pushy bad-ass, but with a tender side to it. its a challenge for her to fit in with others in this movie. Everything she once knew is gone, and she is still having night terrors and is physically scarred by her experiences with the alien on the Nostromo. Weaver was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress, which was/still is unheard of considering what genre this movie is in. Ripley also bonds with the only survivor of the colonists, a little girl nicknamed "Newt." Again, the bond that blossoms between the two is very believable. And the supporting cast is top notch.

Then there is the Alien Queen. WOW!! Created by the late great Stan Winston, the Alien Queen is one of the most menacing creatures in movie history. She is so believable in terms of movement and motivation, she leaps off the screen at us in the audience. the James Horner's music compliments everything. It is sparse, but when it comes on it's like a hammer that gets our attention and helps the story progress. "Bishop's Countdown" is now one of the most famous tracks and trailer cues ever written, and for good reason. The horror aspects, when they happen in the film, are absolutely superb. They are so graphic and well-timed that you feel like either screaming, or getting sick. But this is necessary blood and gore, as well as making you truly care about the characters and how it successfully creates a sense of unease over who will die and who will survive. This film is a classic film in the two big ones people go to see, horror and action. The directing is great, the acting is great, the action is beyond awesome. Check it out if you want to be truly given a big dose of adrenaline.

    In some ways this is a better movie than Alien. There are characters besides Ripley you become invested in in Aliens. But, you can't beat the suspense of Alien. Alien did a great job with the unexpected betrayal of the crew android, and Aliens did a great job using the new crew android as an ally. I don't know why, but in my mind I group the little girl, Newt, from Aliens in with the Ewoks from Return of the Jedi. I found Newt unnecessary -- yes, it did bring a new dimension to Ripley, but I don't think that we needed that new dimension. Kyle Reese from Terminator has a supporting role as a near-love interest. He didn't make it all the way through the movie, but he was very good here. The fight with the Queen was drawn out, but it understandably couldn't end very quickly. Whether or not you liked Alien, I recommend Aliens. But, I definitely don't recommend the following movies. I may watch the Alien cubed because Tywin Lannister is in it, but watch at your own risk -- I've never heard good things.

    There are very few sequels in cinema that have managed to surpass the originals in the reach of their appeal and overcome the expectations of the loyal, faithful fans of the original films. James Cameron's Aliens, somehow, exactly manages to do that by taking the original story of Ridley Scott's Alien and expanding upon it in ways most sequels are afraid to. Aliens is, without a doubt, one of the best sequels ever made and just like Alien, is one of the best offerings of its or any other genre. It is set in the same universe of Alien but is way more bigger & action-packed than the original and succeeds not only as a great sci-fi horror but also re-defines the action genre. Aliens is set 57 years after the events of the first film. It begins with Ripley being rescued & revived from hyper-sleep after drifting in space for more than 50 years. After hearing her account of what happened to her former crew on Nostromo, the panel board turns down her story, revokes her space-flight license & makes her aware of the colonization of the planet LV-426, where the alien spaceship was found in the first film. Things set in motion when the contact with the colony on planet LV-426 is lost and Ripley is requested to join a group of space marines to investigate which she, after initially refusing, finally accepts in order to face & overcome her fears. While Alien gave equal importance to each of its characters, Aliens places more emphasis on Ripley and is basically her journey from undergoing severe traumatic nightmares caused due to the events of the first film to facing her fears head on in this sequel. James Cameron is an extremely talented writer-director not because he knows what great action is all about but because he's always able to back it up with a highly compelling story which is further elevated by jaw-dropping visuals. Coming from the success of The Terminator, Cameron could have easily made a loose sequel of Alien by repeating the concept of the first film but chose to do it differently by expanding the universe of the previous film and giving an insight into the evolution of the creatures as well as Ripley. While Alien was a slow building masterpiece of atmospheric tension, Aliens travels the same road to some extent but then takes a slightly different turn by replacing the survival horror of its predecessor with a highly intense, bombastic & violent war between two species, unlike anything that existed before it. There is less suspense in this film than Alien, but Cameron makes up for it by turning Aliens into an action-thriller filled with intense moments of relentless terror, highly potent combat sequences and finally culminates the story with a bone-chilling climax. The part of Ellen Ripley is brilliantly written by Cameron. He penned down Sigourney Weaver's character with extreme care & provided much more depth to Ripley. Also, her relationship with Newt in this film gave Weaver new emotional dimensions to explore. With such a layered canvas crafted by Cameron to build upon, Weaver was able to capitalize and ended up giving a truly remarkable performance, thus becoming the first real female action figure in cinema. Supporting her are other excellent performances too, especially by Carrie Henn as Newt, a traumatized young girl who is the only former survivor on the colonized planet and with whom Ripley forms a motherly bond. Lance Henriksen provides his very own dimensions to the character of Bishop, the android. The space marines have their bad-ass attitude in tact and each one of them is given a distinct trait. And the team of Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton & others did a commendable job in portraying them on-screen. Solid performances all around. As for this film's technical achievements, Aliens' art direction & set designs may not have surpassed the artistic levels set in the previous film but it certainly comes close. However, the one category where this film sets a new benchmark of its time is in its state-of-the-art visual & sound effects. Visual effects are absolutely groundbreaking and that's one part which has since become a trademark in James Cameron's films. Sound always plays a big role in combat & horror films and is impressive here as well, be it the sound of guns blazing, aliens shrieking or explosions. Cinematography successfully creates a more evolved atmosphere of what existed in the original film. Editing is cleverly done & it successfully manages to keep the viewers gripped to their seats for 2.5 hours which goes pretty unnoticed. And finally, the score perfectly balances the tone of the film and stays in sync with the film's content. It's loud, terrifying, suspenseful & also touching wherever & whenever it's supposed to be. Splendid work by composer James Horner. Even though many fans will be divided over which is a better film between Ridley Scott's Alien & James Cameron's Aliens, there is no denying that both films are masterpieces & immortal for their contribution to horror, action & science-fiction genres. And looking back, Aliens is indeed a perfect follow-up to Alien, not just because it explores the elements of the original beautifully, but also because it places greater emphasis on staying true to the original by following it up with an equally mesmerizing story rather than something made just for financial gains, like most sequels of today. Highly entertaining, immensely satisfying & a spectacular roller-coaster ride of non-stop action, Aliens refuses to age even after three decades and continues to rank amongst the most intense & fulfilling pieces of action films, ever. And a final note to whoever is reading this: Although Aliens is strong enough to be a standalone film, it still would be a wiser move to visit the original by Ridley Scott before moving on to this one. And just like Alien, James Cameron's Aliens is strongly recommended as well.

    James Cameron took over directing duties from Ridley Scott, and like the original, directs this with remarkable intensity and suspense, as Ripley is rescued from her hyper sleep, and later persuaded to return to the same alien planet where all that horror she left behind comes back multiplied, after a colony stumbles upon the same derelict ship, and comes into contact with the merciless alien creatures... A model on how to produce a sequel; continue the original, building on the plot without repeating it, while at the same time respecting the past, and putting your own stamp on things. Just like the first, this is extremely effective in story, character development, and excitement, building to an action-packed and satisfying climax. One of the finest sequels ever made!

    There is no doubt that James Cameron is a master film maker with such classic films as Terminator 1 & 2 and True Lies under his belt (which are all personal favourites of mine). He also created Aliens which is a near perfect follow up to the popular 1979 film Alien. The film begins with a salvage crew discovering a ship which Ripley (Weaver) has been drifting in for 57 years as a result of being in some sort of hyper sleep. She still has her beloved cat Jonesey from the first film who presumably must have been in a hyper sleep as well. We quickly learn that in the 57 years that Ripley has been asleep (I think only Sleeping Beauty has slept for longer than that)that there have been colonies of families that have been studying the planet where Ripley's crew discovered the Alien life forms in the first film. When contact becomes lost with the colony, a group of marines are sent in to investigate what's been going on - this is initially done as a precaution as they suspect that contact has been lost due to a faulty transmitter. Upon hearing this, Ripley isn't convinced that a faulty transmitter is to blame and she suspects that there is a possibility that the Aliens may have re-surfaced. This leads to Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) and Lt Gorman (William Hope) asking Ripley to join them as a 'consultant' as she is more knowledgeable about the Aliens and they believe that if they are out there, that she will be the best person to assist the Marines in eradicating the Aliens for good. I think there are 2 main reasons why this works better than Alien. Firstly, the pacing; Aliens gets going a lot more quickly than Alien and never dragged or became dull - this was part of the problem with Alien - the action scenes were good in Alien, but the first 45 minutes were a complete bore. Second was the action scenes - James Cameron is just so much better at creating action sequences which ultimately made Aliens a much more exciting film. One thing that was great about Alien was the direction and the way the tension was created, but James Cameron even with the faster pacing and better action sequences still managed to create arguably greater tension and even crisper direction (but what did you expect from the mastermind behind the excellent original Terminator and the masterpiece of Terminator 2 that followed). The only minor gripe that I had was the character of Hudson (portrayed by Bill Paxton). Whilst Paxton's acting was great, his character was really annoying with his constant whining and repeatedly saying 'Man' at the end of every sentence. Other than that, I will happily sing this film's praises! Whilst Aliens is undoubtedly a better film than Alien, I would recommend watching Alien before Aliens as you will have a better understanding of the themes contained in Aliens.

    This movie made such an impact on me when I saw it as a teen in 1987. That's because of the powerful story, strong characters that you care about and lots of fast paced action. And of course a truckload of one-liners (mostly from Hudson/Bill Paxton), which I still remember to this day. You can say this movie changed my life. Leave it to James Cameron to make a sequel to a classic sci-fi horror film and turn it into a action movie, that's just as good (even better I think). It ages well, even though some technology is outdated now. One of the greatest science fiction action movies ever. PS: And i'll never watch Alien 3 again. What it did to the surviving characters was unforgiving.

    People often argue the merits and their personal preference for Alien or Aliens, but not even a 57 year debate wouldn't settle that argument. I'm just glad we have two such great (and different) films to enjoy. For my two cents, although I love Alien, it's Aliens that I've comfortably watched more times. It's like a great roller coaster, once you catch a glimpse of it you need to hop on board, strap in, and enjoy the ride. Cameron was never (nor should he) going to outdo Ridley in terms of mood and atmosphere. So Cameron played to his strengths and changed gears (breaking a transaxle in the process, sorry!). What we're left with is a film that sits happily in (and adds to) the universe that Ridley and Co. so beautifully created and ranks as once of greatest action/sci-fi films ever, and certainly my favourite. So go (re)watch it!

    Ridley Scott's "Alien" was a classic sci-fi horror film. He used claustrophobic sets and atmosphere to create a creepy, modern monster film. James Cameron's "Aliens," however, is a great sci-fi action film. Both films benefit from having competent directors at the helm. Both directors take a different approach to the material, which lends each film a unique feel. We never feel like we just watched the same movie twice, nor that we saw an inferior spin-off of the first--common complaints about sequels. "Aliens" is a self-contained story. (I actually saw "Aliens" before I saw "Alien"... back in the third grade. My parents were cool like that.) The action picks up 57 years after the events in the first film. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has been in hibernation since her first ordeal with the alien. Her story of the alien is met with derision, and her bosses demote her for blowing up her ship, the Nostromo. Ripley is horrified to learn colonists have been living on the planet where her crew encountered the alien for 20 years. However, when contact breaks off with the colonists, Ripley is sent in with the Marines as a consultant to confront the aliens. The Marines find the colony devoid of life, except for one little girl, Newt, who has managed to survive by hiding in the vents. Lesser films use children as a cheap device to force the audience to care about the outcome of the story. Here, the relationship between Ripley and Newt is pivotal to showing Ripley's maternal side, which is essential to the development of the character. Cameron takes his time setting up the story and building suspense. Almost an hour passes before the first encounter with the aliens. The set-up can be perfunctory at times, with dialogue between the Marines seemingly copy-and-pasted from "Full Metal Jacket." From the midway point, however, the action doesn't let up. We sat through the slow ride to the top of the roller coaster, and it is all thrills until the end. This film is now 27 years old and was so popular that if you're reading this, you probably have already seen it. I will instead write about one of the themes of the Alien franchise that I find interesting in understanding the films. Much has been written about how the franchise is actually about rape. However, I will write about the series's feminist undertones. My Western Civ teacher at the University of Kansas, John Younger, lectured about how the feminist movement can be traced through the series. "Alien" was released in '70s, a time when the feminist movement was in its most militant phase. Ripley, a butch female, single-handedly destroys the alien (which has a penis-shaped head and penis-like extremities protruding from its body). This was after it had already killed all her male companions, proving that "women need men the way fish need bicycles." "Aliens" came out in '80s, when feminists began to embrace their femininity. We see this in the motherly role Ripley adopts toward Newt. Ripley goes alone with a pulse rifle taped to a grenade launcher to rescue Newt from the alien queen. "Alien 3" came out in '90s, when the feminist movement became more inclusive, and progressive men could actually be considered feminists. In the third installment, the men of the penal colony work together with Ripley to destroy the alien. As for the subsequent movies, it's better to just mentally erase them. The films also celebrate Native American art. Alien creator H.R. Giger was a great admirer of pre-Columbian art, and based the alien design partly on the stone reliefs of the Chav&iacute;n culture, a pre-Inca Andean society. One creature in Chav&iacute;n art is notably depicted with a mouth within its mouth. Considering these things adds layers of appreciation for the viewers. Ultimately, "Aliens" works because the filmmakers set out to make a good movie, rather than crank out a sequel simply to cash in on the success of its predecessor.

    'Aliens' came out in 1986, so the quality of it won't be as good as a movie coming out today. I'm not giving this movie any special treatment for that. I'm reviewing and rating it just like I would rate and review a movie that would come out now. Anyway, there are two types of people in the world: people who think 'Alien' is better than 'Aliens', and people who think 'Aliens' is better than 'Alien'. I don't think either of them is better than another. I watched the 1990 special addition of the movie, so it's two and a half hours long. 'Aliens' had a very slow first hour of the movie. It worked for only about twenty minutes. The movie then started dragging on for the other forty minutes. In the first twenty minutes, it was alright because the slowness hadn't gotten boring yet, it was just used to introduce new characters and go over the situation at hand. This part of the first hour was enjoyable. As it went on, though, we had already known all of the characters and there was just nothing going on. There was quite a bit of CGI used near the end of the first hour, which I think they could gone without using, because it was two-dimensional CGI. There were also green screens used, which also brought it down. That was part of the reason the forty minute boring part was bad. The other part of the reason is that it was simply unexciting. The acting in this movie had a few problems, too. A few of the actors didn't seem to give it their all. Luckily, the main actors and actresses (Sigourney Weaver, Carrie Henn, and Michael Biehn) did well. I believed those three actors and actresses were their characters. The supposed cast weren't all very good, though. In several scenes of this movie, the characters would have to be quiet to get through places, and there was no music in these parts. This made suspense build up to set up for action sequences. They executed this well in the film. It made trauma for the audience and even some intensity. That worked in the movie. They also didn't just have mindless acting in the movie. Every sequence had a reason for it's happening, which just made it more enjoyable. That brings up the quality of the acting sequences. The acting sequences were great. They had alright music for the situations and had very thrilling humans vs. aliens battle scenes. There were used of guns which brought more explosions that just made it more thrilling. Also, the humans didn't just win every time. There was an equal balance of aliens winning, too. This made the movie more thrilling and intense. It wouldn't have been good if the humans won every time. The technology used in that time period wasn't too far- fetched, either. Overall, this movie was really good. That's what my 8/10 rating means. I very much recommend 'Alien' and 'Aliens' to anyone who is thinking about watching it. I own the movie on Blu-Ray.

    For every dozen sequels that aren't as good as their originals, there comes a badass flick like Aliens that not only is as good as alien, but better in every category. The Story of Aliens is that Ripley, still haunted and traumatized after the events of the first film, is asked by her employers: The Weyland- Yutani Corporation to take a squad of colonial marines to destroy a possible Xenomorph infestation there. The performances by everyone in the cast are compelling and memorable, especially from Sigourney Weaver as Ripley who puts on one of, if not the, best performances I have ever seen on film. The sound design is also equally commendable; nothing is quite as memorable to me as the sound of a marine's pulse rifle firing, or the screeching of Xenomorphs. Speaking of Xenomorphs, I love the angle that director James Cameron took with them. We get to see more of the inner workings of their hive, how they think how they fight together, their thought process, how intelligent they can be, and just how dangerous they truly are. The story is kind of familiar (Believe me, the idea of being trapped behind enemy lines isn't exactly new here) but I think that it works to the films advantage. It takes some of those familiar themes and adds a whole new layer to them and makes them fit into the alien universe. Like the previous film it takes the familiar Good vs Evil and adds a whole new dimension to it. A connection of Vietnam can also be made to this film (If you are reading this, please don't start a flame war) I mean think about it: We have over cocky, over confident, marines going into unknown territory to fight an enemy they don't quite understand, and are defeated by the enemy that uses unconventional tactics in battle. James Cameron even said that some of the designs (Weapons, ships, etc.) Were taken from the Vietnam War. The films also takes the uncanny high levels of tension from Alien and cranks it up to a thousand. The dialogue is some of the best in cinematic history, and the characters are great as well. Another thing that must be mentioned, I also really liked the relationship between Newt and Ripley. It is portrayed realistically and adds a whole new dimension to the character of Ellen Ripley. Don't worry, Newt isn't annoying or stupid for a kid. In fact, she is actually really smart and reacts with brains instead of brawn. Hell, she even helps save Ripley at some points. Aliens is a masterpiece. Great writing, special effects, amazing gripping story, good set design, great mood and tone, action, and horror all contribute to this being one of the best film of all time. F**k those that don't like this movie, whether or not Aliens is better than Alien can actually be debated till you're black and blue in the face. But what can't be debated is that Aliens is a not only a masterpiece of science-fiction, but also a masterpiece of cinema.

    When Ridley Scott's "Alien" came out in 1979, people were thrilled and scared out of their minds by it. One of those people was Writer/Director James Cameron. He was so enamored with the world of "Alien" he decided to write a sequel to it. Then, after his first major film, "The terminator," came out Fox immediately took his script and picked him as the director. What we have here is not only one of his best movies, but one of the greatest sequels of all time. The story begins 57 years after the first film, where Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is finally rescued in her pod. the planet where the alien colony was first discovered by her and her crew, is now mining planet LV-426, which has lost contact with Earth. She is brought on as a "consultant" to a battalion of Marines and a higher-up in the company to go investigate and establish contact once again. Once they get there though, our friends with the taste for human brains (multiplied by the hundreds this time around instead of one) destroy half of the group forcing the survivors to barricade themselves to fend off the vicious monsters. One of James Cameron's claims to fame is his ability to make his characters believable. This proof comes in the form of Ripley. Sigourney Weaver plays her brilliantly, as a driven, determined, and slightly pushy bad-ass, but with a tender side to it. its a challenge for her to fit in with others in this movie. Everything she once knew is gone, and she is still having night terrors and is physically scarred by her experiences with the alien on the Nostromo. Weaver was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress, which was/still is unheard of considering what genre this movie is in. Ripley also bonds with the only survivor of the colonists, a little girl nicknamed "Newt." Again, the bond that blossoms between the two is very believable. And the supporting cast is top notch. Each marine has a memorable personality, and eventually warm up to Ripley and begin to understand the gravity of their situation in this hell-hole. Even Bishop the Android (Lance Henriksen) is given a great personality, and on that Ripley has to learn to trust after her experiences with the evil Ash in the first film. What makes this film far different from "Alien" is instead of it being a straight up horror/suspense film, the action in this movie is turned up infinitely more, and for good use. Cameron is the master of action and he uses his skills here to a great degree. The action itself plays against a larger environment, expertly designed by Peter Lamont, with he help of artists Ron Cobb and Syd mead, two of the greatest graphic designers ever. Then there is the Alien Queen. WOW!! Created by the late great Stan Winston, the Alien Queen is one of the most menacing creatures in movie history. She is so believable in terms of movement and motivation, she leaps off the screen at us in the audience. the James Horner's music compliments everything. It is sparse, but when it comes on it's like a hammer that gets our attention and helps the story progress. "Bishop's Countdown" is now one of the most famous tracks and trailer cues ever written, and for good reason. The horror aspects, when they happen in the film, are absolutely superb. They are so graphic and well-timed that you feel like either screaming, or getting sick. But this is necessary blood and gore, as well as making you truly care about the characters and how it successfully creates a sense of unease over who will die and who will survive. This film is a classic film in the two big ones people go to see, horror and action. The directing is great, the acting is great, the action is beyond awesome. Check it out if you want to be truly given a big dose of adrenaline.

    In some ways this is a better movie than Alien. There are characters besides Ripley you become invested in in Aliens. But, you can't beat the suspense of Alien. Alien did a great job with the unexpected betrayal of the crew android, and Aliens did a great job using the new crew android as an ally. I don't know why, but in my mind I group the little girl, Newt, from Aliens in with the Ewoks from Return of the Jedi. I found Newt unnecessary -- yes, it did bring a new dimension to Ripley, but I don't think that we needed that new dimension. Kyle Reese from Terminator has a supporting role as a near-love interest. He didn't make it all the way through the movie, but he was very good here. The fight with the Queen was drawn out, but it understandably couldn't end very quickly. Whether or not you liked Alien, I recommend Aliens. But, I definitely don't recommend the following movies. I may watch the Alien cubed because Tywin Lannister is in it, but watch at your own risk -- I've never heard good things.

And looking back, Aliens is indeed a perfect follow-up to Alien, not just because it explores the elements of the original beautifully, but also because it places greater emphasis on staying true to the original by following it up with an equally mesmerizing story rather than something made just for financial gains, like most sequels of today. Highly entertaining, immensely satisfying & a spectacular roller-coaster ride of non-stop action, Aliens refuses to age even after three decades and continues to rank amongst the most intense & fulfilling pieces of action films, ever. And a final note to whoever is reading this: Although Aliens is strong enough to be a standalone film, it still would be a wiser move to visit the original by Ridley Scott before moving on to this one. And just like Alien, James Cameron's Aliens is strongly recommended as well.

    James Cameron took over directing duties from Ridley Scott, and like the original, directs this with remarkable intensity and suspense, as Ripley is rescued from her hyper sleep, and later persuaded to return to the same alien planet where all that horror she left behind comes back multiplied, after a colony stumbles upon the same derelict ship, and comes into contact with the merciless alien creatures... A model on how to produce a sequel; continue the original, building on the plot without repeating it, while at the same time respecting the past, and putting your own stamp on things. Just like the first, this is extremely effective in story, character development, and excitement, building to an action-packed and satisfying climax. One of the finest sequels ever made!

    There is no doubt that James Cameron is a master film maker with such classic films as Terminator 1 & 2 and True Lies under his belt (which are all personal favourites of mine). He also created Aliens which is a near perfect follow up to the popular 1979 film Alien. The film begins with a salvage crew discovering a ship which Ripley (Weaver) has been drifting in for 57 years as a result of being in some sort of hyper sleep. She still has her beloved cat Jonesey from the first film who presumably must have been in a hyper sleep as well. We quickly learn that in the 57 years that Ripley has been asleep (I think only Sleeping Beauty has slept for longer than that)that there have been colonies of families that have been studying the planet where Ripley's crew discovered the Alien life forms in the first film. When contact becomes lost with the colony, a group of marines are sent in to investigate what's been going on - this is initially done as a precaution as they suspect that contact has been lost due to a faulty transmitter. Upon hearing this, Ripley isn't convinced that a faulty transmitter is to blame and she suspects that there is a possibility that the Aliens may have re-surfaced. This leads to Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) and Lt Gorman (William Hope) asking Ripley to join them as a 'consultant' as she is more knowledgeable about the Aliens and they believe that if they are out there, that she will be the best person to assist the Marines in eradicating the Aliens for good. I think there are 2 main reasons why this works better than Alien. Firstly, the pacing; Aliens gets going a lot more quickly than Alien and never dragged or became dull - this was part of the problem with Alien - the action scenes were good in Alien, but the first 45 minutes were a complete bore. Second was the action scenes - James Cameron is just so much better at creating action sequences which ultimately made Aliens a much more exciting film. One thing that was great about Alien was the direction and the way the tension was created, but James Cameron even with the faster pacing and better action sequences still managed to create arguably greater tension and even crisper direction (but what did you expect from the mastermind behind the excellent original Terminator and the masterpiece of Terminator 2 that followed). The only minor gripe that I had was the character of Hudson (portrayed by Bill Paxton). Whilst Paxton's acting was great, his character was really annoying with his constant whining and repeatedly saying 'Man' at the end of every sentence. Other than that, I will happily sing this film's praises! Whilst Aliens is undoubtedly a better film than Alien, I would recommend watching Alien before Aliens as you will have a better understanding of the themes contained in Aliens.

    This movie made such an impact on me when I saw it as a teen in 1987. That's because of the powerful story, strong characters that you care about and lots of fast paced action. And of course a truckload of one-liners (mostly from Hudson/Bill Paxton), which I still remember to this day. You can say this movie changed my life. Leave it to James Cameron to make a sequel to a classic sci-fi horror film and turn it into a action movie, that's just as good (even better I think). It ages well, even though some technology is outdated now. One of the greatest science fiction action movies ever. PS: And i'll never watch Alien 3 again. What it did to the surviving characters was unforgiving.

    People often argue the merits and their personal preference for Alien or Aliens, but not even a 57 year debate wouldn't settle that argument. I'm just glad we have two such great (and different) films to enjoy. For my two cents, although I love Alien, it's Aliens that I've comfortably watched more times. It's like a great roller coaster, once you catch a glimpse of it you need to hop on board, strap in, and enjoy the ride. Cameron was never (nor should he) going to outdo Ridley in terms of mood and atmosphere. So Cameron played to his strengths and changed gears (breaking a transaxle in the process, sorry!). What we're left with is a film that sits happily in (and adds to) the universe that Ridley and Co. so beautifully created and ranks as once of greatest action/sci-fi films ever, and certainly my favourite. So go (re)watch it!

    Ridley Scott's "Alien" was a classic sci-fi horror film. He used claustrophobic sets and atmosphere to create a creepy, modern monster film. James Cameron's "Aliens," however, is a great sci-fi action film. Both films benefit from having competent directors at the helm. Both directors take a different approach to the material, which lends each film a unique feel. We never feel like we just watched the same movie twice, nor that we saw an inferior spin-off of the first--common complaints about sequels. "Aliens" is a self-contained story. (I actually saw "Aliens" before I saw "Alien"... back in the third grade. My parents were cool like that.) The action picks up 57 years after the events in the first film. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has been in hibernation since her first ordeal with the alien. Her story of the alien is met with derision, and her bosses demote her for blowing up her ship, the Nostromo. Ripley is horrified to learn colonists have been living on the planet where her crew encountered the alien for 20 years. However, when contact breaks off with the colonists, Ripley is sent in with the Marines as a consultant to confront the aliens. The Marines find the colony devoid of life, except for one little girl, Newt, who has managed to survive by hiding in the vents. Lesser films use children as a cheap device to force the audience to care about the outcome of the story. Here, the relationship between Ripley and Newt is pivotal to showing Ripley's maternal side, which is essential to the development of the character. Cameron takes his time setting up the story and building suspense. Almost an hour passes before the first encounter with the aliens. The set-up can be perfunctory at times, with dialogue between the Marines seemingly copy-and-pasted from "Full Metal Jacket." From the midway point, however, the action doesn't let up. We sat through the slow ride to the top of the roller coaster, and it is all thrills until the end. This film is now 27 years old and was so popular that if you're reading this, you probably have already seen it. I will instead write about one of the themes of the Alien franchise that I find interesting in understanding the films. Much has been written about how the franchise is actually about rape. However, I will write about the series's feminist undertones. My Western Civ teacher at the University of Kansas, John Younger, lectured about how the feminist movement can be traced through the series. "Alien" was released in '70s, a time when the feminist movement was in its most militant phase. Ripley, a butch female, single-handedly destroys the alien (which has a penis-shaped head and penis-like extremities protruding from its body). This was after it had already killed all her male companions, proving that "women need men the way fish need bicycles." "Aliens" came out in '80s, when feminists began to embrace their femininity. We see this in the motherly role Ripley adopts toward Newt. Ripley goes alone with a pulse rifle taped to a grenade launcher to rescue Newt from the alien queen. "Alien 3" came out in '90s, when the feminist movement became more inclusive, and progressive men could actually be considered feminists. In the third installment, the men of the penal colony work together with Ripley to destroy the alien. As for the subsequent movies, it's better to just mentally erase them. The films also celebrate Native American art. Alien creator H.R. Giger was a great admirer of pre-Columbian art, and based the alien design partly on the stone reliefs of the Chav&iacute;n culture, a pre-Inca Andean society. One creature in Chav&iacute;n art is notably depicted with a mouth within its mouth. Considering these things adds layers of appreciation for the viewers. Ultimately, "Aliens" works because the filmmakers set out to make a good movie, rather than crank out a sequel simply to cash in on the success of its predecessor.

    'Aliens' came out in 1986, so the quality of it won't be as good as a movie coming out today. I'm not giving this movie any special treatment for that. I'm reviewing and rating it just like I would rate and review a movie that would come out now. Anyway, there are two types of people in the world: people who think 'Alien' is better than 'Aliens', and people who think 'Aliens' is better than 'Alien'. I don't think either of them is better than another. I watched the 1990 special addition of the movie, so it's two and a half hours long. 'Aliens' had a very slow first hour of the movie. It worked for only about twenty minutes. The movie then started dragging on for the other forty minutes. In the first twenty minutes, it was alright because the slowness hadn't gotten boring yet, it was just used to introduce new characters and go over the situation at hand. This part of the first hour was enjoyable. As it went on, though, we had already known all of the characters and there was just nothing going on. There was quite a bit of CGI used near the end of the first hour, which I think they could gone without using, because it was two-dimensional CGI. There were also green screens used, which also brought it down. That was part of the reason the forty minute boring part was bad. The other part of the reason is that it was simply unexciting. The acting in this movie had a few problems, too. A few of the actors didn't seem to give it their all. Luckily, the main actors and actresses (Sigourney Weaver, Carrie Henn, and Michael Biehn) did well. I believed those three actors and actresses were their characters. The supposed cast weren't all very good, though. In several scenes of this movie, the characters would have to be quiet to get through places, and there was no music in these parts. This made suspense build up to set up for action sequences. They executed this well in the film. It made trauma for the audience and even some intensity. That worked in the movie. They also didn't just have mindless acting in the movie. Every sequence had a reason for it's happening, which just made it more enjoyable. That brings up the quality of the acting sequences. The acting sequences were great. They had alright music for the situations and had very thrilling humans vs. aliens battle scenes. There were used of guns which brought more explosions that just made it more thrilling. Also, the humans didn't just win every time. There was an equal balance of aliens winning, too. This made the movie more thrilling and intense. It wouldn't have been good if the humans won every time. The technology used in that time period wasn't too far- fetched, either. Overall, this movie was really good. That's what my 8/10 rating means. I very much recommend 'Alien' and 'Aliens' to anyone who is thinking about watching it. I own the movie on Blu-Ray.

    For every dozen sequels that aren't as good as their originals, there comes a badass flick like Aliens that not only is as good as alien, but better in every category. The Story of Aliens is that Ripley, still haunted and traumatized after the events of the first film, is asked by her employers: The Weyland- Yutani Corporation to take a squad of colonial marines to destroy a possible Xenomorph infestation there. The performances by everyone in the cast are compelling and memorable, especially from Sigourney Weaver as Ripley who puts on one of, if not the, best performances I have ever seen on film. The sound design is also equally commendable; nothing is quite as memorable to me as the sound of a marine's pulse rifle firing, or the screeching of Xenomorphs. Speaking of Xenomorphs, I love the angle that director James Cameron took with them. We get to see more of the inner workings of their hive, how they think how they fight together, their thought process, how intelligent they can be, and just how dangerous they truly are. The story is kind of familiar (Believe me, the idea of being trapped behind enemy lines isn't exactly new here) but I think that it works to the films advantage. It takes some of those familiar themes and adds a whole new layer to them and makes them fit into the alien universe. Like the previous film it takes the familiar Good vs Evil and adds a whole new dimension to it. A connection of Vietnam can also be made to this film (If you are reading this, please don't start a flame war) I mean think about it: We have over cocky, over confident, marines going into unknown territory to fight an enemy they don't quite understand, and are defeated by the enemy that uses unconventional tactics in battle. James Cameron even said that some of the designs (Weapons, ships, etc.) Were taken from the Vietnam War. The films also takes the uncanny high levels of tension from Alien and cranks it up to a thousand. The dialogue is some of the best in cinematic history, and the characters are great as well. Another thing that must be mentioned, I also really liked the relationship between Newt and Ripley. It is portrayed realistically and adds a whole new dimension to the character of Ellen Ripley. Don't worry, Newt isn't annoying or stupid for a kid. In fact, she is actually really smart and reacts with brains instead of brawn. Hell, she even helps save Ripley at some points. Aliens is a masterpiece. Great writing, special effects, amazing gripping story, good set design, great mood and tone, action, and horror all contribute to this being one of the best film of all time. F**k those that don't like this movie, whether or not Aliens is better than Alien can actually be debated till you're black and blue in the face. But what can't be debated is that Aliens is a not only a masterpiece of science-fiction, but also a masterpiece of cinema.

    When Ridley Scott's "Alien" came out in 1979, people were thrilled and scared out of their minds by it. One of those people was Writer/Director James Cameron. He was so enamored with the world of "Alien" he decided to write a sequel to it. Then, after his first major film, "The terminator," came out Fox immediately took his script and picked him as the director. What we have here is not only one of his best movies, but one of the greatest sequels of all time. The story begins 57 years after the first film, where Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is finally rescued in her pod. the planet where the alien colony was first discovered by her and her crew, is now mining planet LV-426, which has lost contact with Earth. She is brought on as a "consultant" to a battalion of Marines and a higher-up in the company to go investigate and establish contact once again. Once they get there though, our friends with the taste for human brains (multiplied by the hundreds this time around instead of one) destroy half of the group forcing the survivors to barricade themselves to fend off the vicious monsters. One of James Cameron's claims to fame is his ability to make his characters believable. This proof comes in the form of Ripley. Sigourney Weaver plays her brilliantly, as a driven, determined, and slightly pushy bad-ass, but with a tender side to it. its a challenge for her to fit in with others in this movie. Everything she once knew is gone, and she is still having night terrors and is physically scarred by her experiences with the alien on the Nostromo. Weaver was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress, which was/still is unheard of considering what genre this movie is in. Ripley also bonds with the only survivor of the colonists, a little girl nicknamed "Newt." Again, the bond that blossoms between the two is very believable. And the supporting cast is top notch. Each marine has a memorable personality, and eventually warm up to Ripley and begin to understand the gravity of their situation in this hell-hole. Even Bishop the Android (Lance Henriksen) is given a great personality, and on that Ripley has to learn to trust after her experiences with the evil Ash in the first film. What makes this film far different from "Alien" is instead of it being a straight up horror/suspense film, the action in this movie is turned up infinitely more, and for good use. Cameron is the master of action and he uses his skills here to a great degree. The action itself plays against a larger environment, expertly designed by Peter Lamont, with he help of artists Ron Cobb and Syd mead, two of the greatest graphic designers ever. Then there is the Alien Queen. WOW!! Created by the late great Stan Winston, the Alien Queen is one of the most menacing creatures in movie history. She is so believable in terms of movement and motivation, she leaps off the screen at us in the audience. the James Horner's music compliments everything. It is sparse, but when it comes on it's like a hammer that gets our attention and helps the story progress. "Bishop's Countdown" is now one of the most famous tracks and trailer cues ever written, and for good reason. The horror aspects, when they happen in the film, are absolutely superb. They are so graphic and well-timed that you feel like either screaming, or getting sick. But this is necessary blood and gore, as well as making you truly care about the characters and how it successfully creates a sense of unease over who will die and who will survive. This film is a classic film in the two big ones people go to see, horror and action. The directing is great, the acting is great, the action is beyond awesome. Check it out if you want to be truly given a big dose of adrenaline.

    In some ways this is a better movie than Alien. There are characters besides Ripley you become invested in in Aliens. But, you can't beat the suspense of Alien. Alien did a great job with the unexpected betrayal of the crew android, and Aliens did a great job using the new crew android as an ally. I don't know why, but in my mind I group the little girl, Newt, from Aliens in with the Ewoks from Return of the Jedi. I found Newt unnecessary -- yes, it did bring a new dimension to Ripley, but I don't think that we needed that new dimension. Kyle Reese from Terminator has a supporting role as a near-love interest. He didn't make it all the way through the movie, but he was very good here. The fight with the Queen was drawn out, but it understandably couldn't end very quickly. Whether or not you liked Alien, I recommend Aliens. But, I definitely don't recommend the following movies. I may watch the Alien cubed because Tywin Lannister is in it, but watch at your own risk -- I've never heard good things.

    There are very few sequels in cinema that have managed to surpass the originals in the reach of their appeal and overcome the expectations of the loyal, faithful fans of the original films. James Cameron's Aliens, somehow, exactly manages to do that by taking the original story of Ridley Scott's Alien and expanding upon it in ways most sequels are afraid to. Aliens is, without a doubt, one of the best sequels ever made and just like Alien, is one of the best offerings of its or any other genre. It is set in the same universe of Alien but is way more bigger & action-packed than the original and succeeds not only as a great sci-fi horror but also re-defines the action genre. Aliens is set 57 years after the events of the first film. It begins with Ripley being rescued & revived from hyper-sleep after drifting in space for more than 50 years. After hearing her account of what happened to her former crew on Nostromo, the panel board turns down her story, revokes her space-flight license & makes her aware of the colonization of the planet LV-426, where the alien spaceship was found in the first film. Things set in motion when the contact with the colony on planet LV-426 is lost and Ripley is requested to join a group of space marines to investigate which she, after initially refusing, finally accepts in order to face & overcome her fears. While Alien gave equal importance to each of its characters, Aliens places more emphasis on Ripley and is basically her journey from undergoing severe traumatic nightmares caused due to the events of the first film to facing her fears head on in this sequel. James Cameron is an extremely talented writer-director not because he knows what great action is all about but because he's always able to back it up with a highly compelling story which is further elevated by jaw-dropping visuals. Coming from the success of The Terminator, Cameron could have easily made a loose sequel of Alien by repeating the concept of the first film but chose to do it differently by expanding the universe of the previous film and giving an insight into the evolution of the creatures as well as Ripley. While Alien was a slow building masterpiece of atmospheric tension, Aliens travels the same road to some extent but then takes a slightly different turn by replacing the survival horror of its predecessor with a highly intense, bombastic & violent war between two species, unlike anything that existed before it. There is less suspense in this film than Alien, but Cameron makes up for it by turning Aliens into an action-thriller filled with intense moments of relentless terror, highly potent combat sequences and finally culminates the story with a bone-chilling climax. The part of Ellen Ripley is brilliantly written by Cameron. He penned down Sigourney Weaver's character with extreme care & provided much more depth to Ripley. Also, her relationship with Newt in this film gave Weaver new emotional dimensions to explore. With such a layered canvas crafted by Cameron to build upon, Weaver was able to capitalize and ended up giving a truly remarkable performance, thus becoming the first real female action figure in cinema. Supporting her are other excellent performances too, especially by Carrie Henn as Newt, a traumatized young girl who is the only former survivor on the colonized planet and with whom Ripley forms a motherly bond. Lance Henriksen provides his very own dimensions to the character of Bishop, the android. The space marines have their bad-ass attitude in tact and each one of them is given a distinct trait. And the team of Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton & others did a commendable job in portraying them on-screen. Solid performances all around. As for this film's technical achievements, Aliens' art direction & set designs may not have surpassed the artistic levels set in the previous film but it certainly comes close. However, the one category where this film sets a new benchmark of its time is in its state-of-the-art visual & sound effects. Visual effects are absolutely groundbreaking and that's one part which has since become a trademark in James Cameron's films. Sound always plays a big role in combat & horror films and is impressive here as well, be it the sound of guns blazing, aliens shrieking or explosions. Cinematography successfully creates a more evolved atmosphere of what existed in the original film. Editing is cleverly done & it successfully manages to keep the viewers gripped to their seats for 2.5 hours which goes pretty unnoticed. And finally, the score perfectly balances the tone of the film and stays in sync with the film's content. It's loud, terrifying, suspenseful & also touching wherever & whenever it's supposed to be. Splendid work by composer James Horner. Even though many fans will be divided over which is a better film between Ridley Scott's Alien & James Cameron's Aliens, there is no denying that both films are masterpieces & immortal for their contribution to horror, action & science-fiction genres. And looking back, Aliens is indeed a perfect follow-up to Alien, not just because it explores the elements of the original beautifully, but also because it places greater emphasis on staying true to the original by following it up with an equally mesmerizing story rather than something made just for financial gains, like most sequels of today. Highly entertaining, immensely satisfying & a spectacular roller-coaster ride of non-stop action, Aliens refuses to age even after three decades and continues to rank amongst the most intense & fulfilling pieces of action films, ever. And a final note to whoever is reading this: Although Aliens is strong enough to be a standalone film, it still would be a wiser move to visit the original by Ridley Scott before moving on to this one. And just like Alien, James Cameron's Aliens is strongly recommended as well.

    There is no doubt that James Cameron is a master film maker with such classic films as Terminator 1 & 2 and True Lies under his belt (which are all personal favourites of mine). He also created Aliens which is a near perfect follow up to the popular 1979 film Alien. The film begins with a salvage crew discovering a ship which Ripley (Weaver) has been drifting in for 57 years as a result of being in some sort of hyper sleep. She still has her beloved cat Jonesey from the first film who presumably must have been in a hyper sleep as well. We quickly learn that in the 57 years that Ripley has been asleep (I think only Sleeping Beauty has slept for longer than that)that there have been colonies of families that have been studying the planet where Ripley's crew discovered the Alien life forms in the first film. When contact becomes lost with the colony, a group of marines are sent in to investigate what's been going on - this is initially done as a precaution as they suspect that contact has been lost due to a faulty transmitter. Upon hearing this, Ripley isn't convinced that a faulty transmitter is to blame and she suspects that there is a possibility that the Aliens may have re-surfaced. This leads to Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) and Lt Gorman (William Hope) asking Ripley to join them as a 'consultant' as she is more knowledgeable about the Aliens and they believe that if they are out there, that she will be the best person to assist the Marines in eradicating the Aliens for good. I think there are 2 main reasons why this works better than Alien. Firstly, the pacing; Aliens gets going a lot more quickly than Alien and never dragged or became dull - this was part of the problem with Alien - the action scenes were good in Alien, but the first 45 minutes were a complete bore. Second was the action scenes - James Cameron is just so much better at creating action sequences which ultimately made Aliens a much more exciting film. One thing that was great about Alien was the direction and the way the tension was created, but James Cameron even with the faster pacing and better action sequences still managed to create arguably greater tension and even crisper direction (but what did you expect from the mastermind behind the excellent original Terminator and the masterpiece of Terminator 2 that followed). The only minor gripe that I had was the character of Hudson (portrayed by Bill Paxton). Whilst Paxton's acting was great, his character was really annoying with his constant whining and repeatedly saying 'Man' at the end of every sentence. Other than that, I will happily sing this film's praises! Whilst Aliens is undoubtedly a better film than Alien, I would recommend watching Alien before Aliens as you will have a better understanding of the themes contained in Aliens.

    People often argue the merits and their personal preference for Alien or Aliens, but not even a 57 year debate wouldn't settle that argument. I'm just glad we have two such great (and different) films to enjoy. For my two cents, although I love Alien, it's Aliens that I've comfortably watched more times. It's like a great roller coaster, once you catch a glimpse of it you need to hop on board, strap in, and enjoy the ride. Cameron was never (nor should he) going to outdo Ridley in terms of mood and atmosphere. So Cameron played to his strengths and changed gears (breaking a transaxle in the process, sorry!). What we're left with is a film that sits happily in (and adds to) the universe that Ridley and Co. so beautifully created and ranks as once of greatest action/sci-fi films ever, and certainly my favourite. So go (re)watch it!

    Ridley Scott's "Alien" was a classic sci-fi horror film. He used claustrophobic sets and atmosphere to create a creepy, modern monster film. James Cameron's "Aliens," however, is a great sci-fi action film. Both films benefit from having competent directors at the helm. Both directors take a different approach to the material, which lends each film a unique feel. We never feel like we just watched the same movie twice, nor that we saw an inferior spin-off of the first--common complaints about sequels. "Aliens" is a self-contained story. (I actually saw "Aliens" before I saw "Alien"... back in the third grade. My parents were cool like that.) The action picks up 57 years after the events in the first film. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has been in hibernation since her first ordeal with the alien. Her story of the alien is met with derision, and her bosses demote her for blowing up her ship, the Nostromo. Ripley is horrified to learn colonists have been living on the planet where her crew encountered the alien for 20 years. However, when contact breaks off with the colonists, Ripley is sent in with the Marines as a consultant to confront the aliens. The Marines find the colony devoid of life, except for one little girl, Newt, who has managed to survive by hiding in the vents. Lesser films use children as a cheap device to force the audience to care about the outcome of the story. Here, the relationship between Ripley and Newt is pivotal to showing Ripley's maternal side, which is essential to the development of the character. Cameron takes his time setting up the story and building suspense. Almost an hour passes before the first encounter with the aliens. The set-up can be perfunctory at times, with dialogue between the Marines seemingly copy-and-pasted from "Full Metal Jacket." From the midway point, however, the action doesn't let up. We sat through the slow ride to the top of the roller coaster, and it is all thrills until the end. This film is now 27 years old and was so popular that if you're reading this, you probably have already seen it. I will instead write about one of the themes of the Alien franchise that I find interesting in understanding the films. Much has been written about how the franchise is actually about rape. However, I will write about the series's feminist undertones. My Western Civ teacher at the University of Kansas, John Younger, lectured about how the feminist movement can be traced through the series. "Alien" was released in '70s, a time when the feminist movement was in its most militant phase. Ripley, a butch female, single-handedly destroys the alien (which has a penis-shaped head and penis-like extremities protruding from its body). This was after it had already killed all her male companions, proving that "women need men the way fish need bicycles." "Aliens" came out in '80s, when feminists began to embrace their femininity. We see this in the motherly role Ripley adopts toward Newt. Ripley goes alone with a pulse rifle taped to a grenade launcher to rescue Newt from the alien queen. "Alien 3" came out in '90s, when the feminist movement became more inclusive, and progressive men could actually be considered feminists. In the third installment, the men of the penal colony work together with Ripley to destroy the alien. As for the subsequent movies, it's better to just mentally erase them. The films also celebrate Native American art. Alien creator H.R. Giger was a great admirer of pre-Columbian art, and based the alien design partly on the stone reliefs of the Chav&iacute;n culture, a pre-Inca Andean society. One creature in Chav&iacute;n art is notably depicted with a mouth within its mouth. Considering these things adds layers of appreciation for the viewers. Ultimately, "Aliens" works because the filmmakers set out to make a good movie, rather than crank out a sequel simply to cash in on the success of its predecessor.

    'Aliens' came out in 1986, so the quality of it won't be as good as a movie coming out today. I'm not giving this movie any special treatment for that. I'm reviewing and rating it just like I would rate and review a movie that would come out now. Anyway, there are two types of people in the world: people who think 'Alien' is better than 'Aliens', and people who think 'Aliens' is better than 'Alien'. I don't think either of them is better than another. I watched the 1990 special addition of the movie, so it's two and a half hours long. 'Aliens' had a very slow first hour of the movie. It worked for only about twenty minutes. The movie then started dragging on for the other forty minutes. In the first twenty minutes, it was alright because the slowness hadn't gotten boring yet, it was just used to introduce new characters and go over the situation at hand. This part of the first hour was enjoyable. As it went on, though, we had already known all of the characters and there was just nothing going on. There was quite a bit of CGI used near the end of the first hour, which I think they could gone without using, because it was two-dimensional CGI. There were also green screens used, which also brought it down. That was part of the reason the forty minute boring part was bad. The other part of the reason is that it was simply unexciting. The acting in this movie had a few problems, too. A few of the actors didn't seem to give it their all. Luckily, the main actors and actresses (Sigourney Weaver, Carrie Henn, and Michael Biehn) did well. I believed those three actors and actresses were their characters. The supposed cast weren't all very good, though. In several scenes of this movie, the characters would have to be quiet to get through places, and there was no music in these parts. This made suspense build up to set up for action sequences. They executed this well in the film. It made trauma for the audience and even some intensity. That worked in the movie. They also didn't just have mindless acting in the movie. Every sequence had a reason for it's happening, which just made it more enjoyable. That brings up the quality of the acting sequences. The acting sequences were great. They had alright music for the situations and had very thrilling humans vs. aliens battle scenes. There were used of guns which brought more explosions that just made it more thrilling. Also, the humans didn't just win every time. There was an equal balance of aliens winning, too. This made the movie more thrilling and intense. It wouldn't have been good if the humans won every time. The technology used in that time period wasn't too far- fetched, either. Overall, this movie was really good. That's what my 8/10 rating means. I very much recommend 'Alien' and 'Aliens' to anyone who is thinking about watching it. I own the movie on Blu-Ray.

    For every dozen sequels that aren't as good as their originals, there comes a badass flick like Aliens that not only is as good as alien, but better in every category. The Story of Aliens is that Ripley, still haunted and traumatized after the events of the first film, is asked by her employers: The Weyland- Yutani Corporation to take a squad of colonial marines to destroy a possible Xenomorph infestation there. The performances by everyone in the cast are compelling and memorable, especially from Sigourney Weaver as Ripley who puts on one of, if not the, best performances I have ever seen on film. The sound design is also equally commendable; nothing is quite as memorable to me as the sound of a marine's pulse rifle firing, or the screeching of Xenomorphs. Speaking of Xenomorphs, I love the angle that director James Cameron took with them. We get to see more of the inner workings of their hive, how they think how they fight together, their thought process, how intelligent they can be, and just how dangerous they truly are. The story is kind of familiar (Believe me, the idea of being trapped behind enemy lines isn't exactly new here) but I think that it works to the films advantage. It takes some of those familiar themes and adds a whole new layer to them and makes them fit into the alien universe. Like the previous film it takes the familiar Good vs Evil and adds a whole new dimension to it. A connection of Vietnam can also be made to this film (If you are reading this, please don't start a flame war) I mean think about it: We have over cocky, over confident, marines going into unknown territory to fight an enemy they don't quite understand, and are defeated by the enemy that uses unconventional tactics in battle. James Cameron even said that some of the designs (Weapons, ships, etc.) Were taken from the Vietnam War. The films also takes the uncanny high levels of tension from Alien and cranks it up to a thousand. The dialogue is some of the best in cinematic history, and the characters are great as well. Another thing that must be mentioned, I also really liked the relationship between Newt and Ripley. It is portrayed realistically and adds a whole new dimension to the character of Ellen Ripley. Don't worry, Newt isn't annoying or stupid for a kid. In fact, she is actually really smart and reacts with brains instead of brawn. Hell, she even helps save Ripley at some points. Aliens is a masterpiece. Great writing, special effects, amazing gripping story, good set design, great mood and tone, action, and horror all contribute to this being one of the best film of all time. F**k those that don't like this movie, whether or not Aliens is better than Alien can actually be debated till you're black and blue in the face. But what can't be debated is that Aliens is a not only a masterpiece of science-fiction, but also a masterpiece of cinema.

    When Ridley Scott's "Alien" came out in 1979, people were thrilled and scared out of their minds by it. One of those people was Writer/Director James Cameron. He was so enamored with the world of "Alien" he decided to write a sequel to it. Then, after his first major film, "The terminator," came out Fox immediately took his script and picked him as the director. What we have here is not only one of his best movies, but one of the greatest sequels of all time. The story begins 57 years after the first film, where Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is finally rescued in her pod. the planet where the alien colony was first discovered by her and her crew, is now mining planet LV-426, which has lost contact with Earth. She is brought on as a "consultant" to a battalion of Marines and a higher-up in the company to go investigate and establish contact once again. Once they get there though, our friends with the taste for human brains (multiplied by the hundreds this time around instead of one) destroy half of the group forcing the survivors to barricade themselves to fend off the vicious monsters. One of James Cameron's claims to fame is his ability to make his characters believable. This proof comes in the form of Ripley. Sigourney Weaver plays her brilliantly, as a driven, determined, and slightly pushy bad-ass, but with a tender side to it. its a challenge for her to fit in with others in this movie. Everything she once knew is gone, and she is still having night terrors and is physically scarred by her experiences with the alien on the Nostromo. Weaver was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress, which was/still is unheard of considering what genre this movie is in. Ripley also bonds with the only survivor of the colonists, a little girl nicknamed "Newt." Again, the bond that blossoms between the two is very believable. And the supporting cast is top notch. Each marine has a memorable personality, and eventually warm up to Ripley and begin to understand the gravity of their situation in this hell-hole. Even Bishop the Android (Lance Henriksen) is given a great personality, and on that Ripley has to learn to trust after her experiences with the evil Ash in the first film. What makes this film far different from "Alien" is instead of it being a straight up horror/suspense film, the action in this movie is turned up infinitely more, and for good use. Cameron is the master of action and he uses his skills here to a great degree. The action itself plays against a larger environment, expertly designed by Peter Lamont, with he help of artists Ron Cobb and Syd mead, two of the greatest graphic designers ever. Then there is the Alien Queen. WOW!! Created by the late great Stan Winston, the Alien Queen is one of the most menacing creatures in movie history. She is so believable in terms of movement and motivation, she leaps off the screen at us in the audience. the James Horner's music compliments everything. It is sparse, but when it comes on it's like a hammer that gets our attention and helps the story progress. "Bishop's Countdown" is now one of the most famous tracks and trailer cues ever written, and for good reason. The horror aspects, when they happen in the film, are absolutely superb. They are so graphic and well-timed that you feel like either screaming, or getting sick. But this is necessary blood and gore, as well as making you truly care about the characters and how it successfully creates a sense of unease over who will die and who will survive. This film is a classic film in the two big ones people go to see, horror and action. The directing is great, the acting is great, the action is beyond awesome. Check it out if you want to be truly given a big dose of adrenaline.

    In some ways this is a better movie than Alien. There are characters besides Ripley you become invested in in Aliens. But, you can't beat the suspense of Alien. Alien did a great job with the unexpected betrayal of the crew android, and Aliens did a great job using the new crew android as an ally. I don't know why, but in my mind I group the little girl, Newt, from Aliens in with the Ewoks from Return of the Jedi. I found Newt unnecessary -- yes, it did bring a new dimension to Ripley, but I don't think that we needed that new dimension. Kyle Reese from Terminator has a supporting role as a near-love interest. He didn't make it all the way through the movie, but he was very good here. The fight with the Queen was drawn out, but it understandably couldn't end very quickly. Whether or not you liked Alien, I recommend Aliens. But, I definitely don't recommend the following movies. I may watch the Alien cubed because Tywin Lannister is in it, but watch at your own risk -- I've never heard good things.

    There are very few sequels in cinema that have managed to surpass the originals in the reach of their appeal and overcome the expectations of the loyal, faithful fans of the original films. James Cameron's Aliens, somehow, exactly manages to do that by taking the original story of Ridley Scott's Alien and expanding upon it in ways most sequels are afraid to. Aliens is, without a doubt, one of the best sequels ever made and just like Alien, is one of the best offerings of its or any other genre. It is set in the same universe of Alien but is way more bigger & action-packed than the original and succeeds not only as a great sci-fi horror but also re-defines the action genre. Aliens is set 57 years after the events of the first film. It begins with Ripley being rescued & revived from hyper-sleep after drifting in space for more than 50 years. After hearing her account of what happened to her former crew on Nostromo, the panel board turns down her story, revokes her space-flight license & makes her aware of the colonization of the planet LV-426, where the alien spaceship was found in the first film. Things set in motion when the contact with the colony on planet LV-426 is lost and Ripley is requested to join a group of space marines to investigate which she, after initially refusing, finally accepts in order to face & overcome her fears. While Alien gave equal importance to each of its characters, Aliens places more emphasis on Ripley and is basically her journey from undergoing severe traumatic nightmares caused due to the events of the first film to facing her fears head on in this sequel. James Cameron is an extremely talented writer-director not because he knows what great action is all about but because he's always able to back it up with a highly compelling story which is further elevated by jaw-dropping visuals. Coming from the success of The Terminator, Cameron could have easily made a loose sequel of Alien by repeating the concept of the first film but chose to do it differently by expanding the universe of the previous film and giving an insight into the evolution of the creatures as well as Ripley. While Alien was a slow building masterpiece of atmospheric tension, Aliens travels the same road to some extent but then takes a slightly different turn by replacing the survival horror of its predecessor with a highly intense, bombastic & violent war between two species, unlike anything that existed before it. There is less suspense in this film than Alien, but Cameron makes up for it by turning Aliens into an action-thriller filled with intense moments of relentless terror, highly potent combat sequences and finally culminates the story with a bone-chilling climax. The part of Ellen Ripley is brilliantly written by Cameron. He penned down Sigourney Weaver's character with extreme care & provided much more depth to Ripley. Also, her relationship with Newt in this film gave Weaver new emotional dimensions to explore. With such a layered canvas crafted by Cameron to build upon, Weaver was able to capitalize and ended up giving a truly remarkable performance, thus becoming the first real female action figure in cinema. Supporting her are other excellent performances too, especially by Carrie Henn as Newt, a traumatized young girl who is the only former survivor on the colonized planet and with whom Ripley forms a motherly bond. Lance Henriksen provides his very own dimensions to the character of Bishop, the android. The space marines have their bad-ass attitude in tact and each one of them is given a distinct trait. And the team of Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton & others did a commendable job in portraying them on-screen. Solid performances all around. As for this film's technical achievements, Aliens' art direction & set designs may not have surpassed the artistic levels set in the previous film but it certainly comes close. However, the one category where this film sets a new benchmark of its time is in its state-of-the-art visual & sound effects. Visual effects are absolutely groundbreaking and that's one part which has since become a trademark in James Cameron's films. Sound always plays a big role in combat & horror films and is impressive here as well, be it the sound of guns blazing, aliens shrieking or explosions. Cinematography successfully creates a more evolved atmosphere of what existed in the original film. Editing is cleverly done & it successfully manages to keep the viewers gripped to their seats for 2.5 hours which goes pretty unnoticed. And finally, the score perfectly balances the tone of the film and stays in sync with the film's content. It's loud, terrifying, suspenseful & also touching wherever & whenever it's supposed to be. Splendid work by composer James Horner. Even though many fans will be divided over which is a better film between Ridley Scott's Alien & James Cameron's Aliens, there is no denying that both films are masterpieces & immortal for their contribution to horror, action & science-fiction genres. And looking back, Aliens is indeed a perfect follow-up to Alien, not just because it explores the elements of the original beautifully, but also because it places greater emphasis on staying true to the original by following it up with an equally mesmerizing story rather than something made just for financial gains, like most sequels of today. Highly entertaining, immensely satisfying & a spectacular roller-coaster ride of non-stop action, Aliens refuses to age even after three decades and continues to rank amongst the most intense & fulfilling pieces of action films, ever. And a final note to whoever is reading this: Although Aliens is strong enough to be a standalone film, it still would be a wiser move to visit the original by Ridley Scott before moving on to this one. And just like Alien, James Cameron's Aliens is strongly recommended as well.

    James Cameron took over directing duties from Ridley Scott, and like the original, directs this with remarkable intensity and suspense, as Ripley is rescued from her hyper sleep, and later persuaded to return to the same alien planet where all that horror she left behind comes back multiplied, after a colony stumbles upon the same derelict ship, and comes into contact with the merciless alien creatures... A model on how to produce a sequel; continue the original, building on the plot without repeating it, while at the same time respecting the past, and putting your own stamp on things. Just like the first, this is extremely effective in story, character development, and excitement, building to an action-packed and satisfying climax. One of the finest sequels ever made!

    There is no doubt that James Cameron is a master film maker with such classic films as Terminator 1 & 2 and True Lies under his belt (which are all personal favourites of mine). He also created Aliens which is a near perfect follow up to the popular 1979 film Alien. The film begins with a salvage crew discovering a ship which Ripley (Weaver) has been drifting in for 57 years as a result of being in some sort of hyper sleep. She still has her beloved cat Jonesey from the first film who presumably must have been in a hyper sleep as well. We quickly learn that in the 57 years that Ripley has been asleep (I think only Sleeping Beauty has slept for longer than that)that there have been colonies of families that have been studying the planet where Ripley's crew discovered the Alien life forms in the first film. When contact becomes lost with the colony, a group of marines are sent in to investigate what's been going on - this is initially done as a precaution as they suspect that contact has been lost due to a faulty transmitter. Upon hearing this, Ripley isn't convinced that a faulty transmitter is to blame and she suspects that there is a possibility that the Aliens may have re-surfaced. This leads to Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) and Lt Gorman (William Hope) asking Ripley to join them as a 'consultant' as she is more knowledgeable about the Aliens and they believe that if they are out there, that she will be the best person to assist the Marines in eradicating the Aliens for good. I think there are 2 main reasons why this works better than Alien. Firstly, the pacing; Aliens gets going a lot more quickly than Alien and never dragged or became dull - this was part of the problem with Alien - the action scenes were good in Alien, but the first 45 minutes were a complete bore. Second was the action scenes - James Cameron is just so much better at creating action sequences which ultimately made Aliens a much more exciting film. One thing that was great about Alien was the direction and the way the tension was created, but James Cameron even with the faster pacing and better action sequences still managed to create arguably greater tension and even crisper direction (but what did you expect from the mastermind behind the excellent original Terminator and the masterpiece of Terminator 2 that followed). The only minor gripe that I had was the character of Hudson (portrayed by Bill Paxton). Whilst Paxton's acting was great, his character was really annoying with his constant whining and repeatedly saying 'Man' at the end of every sentence. Other than that, I will happily sing this film's praises! Whilst Aliens is undoubtedly a better film than Alien, I would recommend watching Alien before Aliens as you will have a better understanding of the themes contained in Aliens.

    This movie made such an impact on me when I saw it as a teen in 1987. That's because of the powerful story, strong characters that you care about and lots of fast paced action. And of course a truckload of one-liners (mostly from Hudson/Bill Paxton), which I still remember to this day. You can say this movie changed my life. Leave it to James Cameron to make a sequel to a classic sci-fi horror film and turn it into a action movie, that's just as good (even better I think). It ages well, even though some technology is outdated now. One of the greatest science fiction action movies ever. PS: And i'll never watch Alien 3 again. What it did to the surviving characters was unforgiving.

"Alien 3" came out in '90s, when the feminist movement became more inclusive, and progressive men could actually be considered feminists. In the third installment, the men of the penal colony work together with Ripley to destroy the alien. As for the subsequent movies, it's better to just mentally erase them.

Ultimately, "Aliens" works because the filmmakers set out to make a good movie, rather than crank out a sequel simply to cash in on the success of its predecessor.

    'Aliens' came out in 1986, so the quality of it won't be as good as a movie coming out today. I'm not giving this movie any special treatment for that. I'm reviewing and rating it just like I would rate and review a movie that would come out now. Anyway, there are two types of people in the world: people who think 'Alien' is better than 'Aliens', and people who think 'Aliens' is better than 'Alien'. I don't think either of them is better than another. I watched the 1990 special addition of the movie, so it's two and a half hours long. 'Aliens' had a very slow first hour of the movie. It worked for only about twenty minutes. The movie then started dragging on for the other forty minutes. In the first twenty minutes, it was alright because the slowness hadn't gotten boring yet, it was just used to introduce new characters and go over the situation at hand. This part of the first hour was enjoyable. As it went on, though, we had already known all of the characters and there was just nothing going on. There was quite a bit of CGI used near the end of the first hour, which I think they could gone without using, because it was two-dimensional CGI. There were also green screens used, which also brought it down. That was part of the reason the forty minute boring part was bad. The other part of the reason is that it was simply unexciting. The acting in this movie had a few problems, too. A few of the actors didn't seem to give it their all. Luckily, the main actors and actresses (Sigourney Weaver, Carrie Henn, and Michael Biehn) did well. I believed those three actors and actresses were their characters. The supposed cast weren't all very good, though. In several scenes of this movie, the characters would have to be quiet to get through places, and there was no music in these parts. This made suspense build up to set up for action sequences. They executed this well in the film. It made trauma for the audience and even some intensity. That worked in the movie. They also didn't just have mindless acting in the movie. Every sequence had a reason for it's happening, which just made it more enjoyable. That brings up the quality of the acting sequences. The acting sequences were great. They had alright music for the situations and had very thrilling humans vs. aliens battle scenes. There were used of guns which brought more explosions that just made it more thrilling. Also, the humans didn't just win every time. There was an equal balance of aliens winning, too. This made the movie more thrilling and intense. It wouldn't have been good if the humans won every time. The technology used in that time period wasn't too far- fetched, either. Overall, this movie was really good. That's what my 8/10 rating means. I very much recommend 'Alien' and 'Aliens' to anyone who is thinking about watching it. I own the movie on Blu-Ray.

    For every dozen sequels that aren't as good as their originals, there comes a badass flick like Aliens that not only is as good as alien, but better in every category. The Story of Aliens is that Ripley, still haunted and traumatized after the events of the first film, is asked by her employers: The Weyland- Yutani Corporation to take a squad of colonial marines to destroy a possible Xenomorph infestation there. The performances by everyone in the cast are compelling and memorable, especially from Sigourney Weaver as Ripley who puts on one of, if not the, best performances I have ever seen on film. The sound design is also equally commendable; nothing is quite as memorable to me as the sound of a marine's pulse rifle firing, or the screeching of Xenomorphs. Speaking of Xenomorphs, I love the angle that director James Cameron took with them. We get to see more of the inner workings of their hive, how they think how they fight together, their thought process, how intelligent they can be, and just how dangerous they truly are. The story is kind of familiar (Believe me, the idea of being trapped behind enemy lines isn't exactly new here) but I think that it works to the films advantage. It takes some of those familiar themes and adds a whole new layer to them and makes them fit into the alien universe. Like the previous film it takes the familiar Good vs Evil and adds a whole new dimension to it. A connection of Vietnam can also be made to this film (If you are reading this, please don't start a flame war) I mean think about it: We have over cocky, over confident, marines going into unknown territory to fight an enemy they don't quite understand, and are defeated by the enemy that uses unconventional tactics in battle. James Cameron even said that some of the designs (Weapons, ships, etc.) Were taken from the Vietnam War. The films also takes the uncanny high levels of tension from Alien and cranks it up to a thousand. The dialogue is some of the best in cinematic history, and the characters are great as well. Another thing that must be mentioned, I also really liked the relationship between Newt and Ripley. It is portrayed realistically and adds a whole new dimension to the character of Ellen Ripley. Don't worry, Newt isn't annoying or stupid for a kid. In fact, she is actually really smart and reacts with brains instead of brawn. Hell, she even helps save Ripley at some points. Aliens is a masterpiece. Great writing, special effects, amazing gripping story, good set design, great mood and tone, action, and horror all contribute to this being one of the best film of all time. F**k those that don't like this movie, whether or not Aliens is better than Alien can actually be debated till you're black and blue in the face. But what can't be debated is that Aliens is a not only a masterpiece of science-fiction, but also a masterpiece of cinema.

    When Ridley Scott's "Alien" came out in 1979, people were thrilled and scared out of their minds by it. One of those people was Writer/Director James Cameron. He was so enamored with the world of "Alien" he decided to write a sequel to it. Then, after his first major film, "The terminator," came out Fox immediately took his script and picked him as the director. What we have here is not only one of his best movies, but one of the greatest sequels of all time. The story begins 57 years after the first film, where Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is finally rescued in her pod. the planet where the alien colony was first discovered by her and her crew, is now mining planet LV-426, which has lost contact with Earth. She is brought on as a "consultant" to a battalion of Marines and a higher-up in the company to go investigate and establish contact once again. Once they get there though, our friends with the taste for human brains (multiplied by the hundreds this time around instead of one) destroy half of the group forcing the survivors to barricade themselves to fend off the vicious monsters. One of James Cameron's claims to fame is his ability to make his characters believable. This proof comes in the form of Ripley. Sigourney Weaver plays her brilliantly, as a driven, determined, and slightly pushy bad-ass, but with a tender side to it. its a challenge for her to fit in with others in this movie. Everything she once knew is gone, and she is still having night terrors and is physically scarred by her experiences with the alien on the Nostromo. Weaver was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress, which was/still is unheard of considering what genre this movie is in. Ripley also bonds with the only survivor of the colonists, a little girl nicknamed "Newt." Again, the bond that blossoms between the two is very believable. And the supporting cast is top notch. Each marine has a memorable personality, and eventually warm up to Ripley and begin to understand the gravity of their situation in this hell-hole. Even Bishop the Android (Lance Henriksen) is given a great personality, and on that Ripley has to learn to trust after her experiences with the evil Ash in the first film. What makes this film far different from "Alien" is instead of it being a straight up horror/suspense film, the action in this movie is turned up infinitely more, and for good use. Cameron is the master of action and he uses his skills here to a great degree. The action itself plays against a larger environment, expertly designed by Peter Lamont, with he help of artists Ron Cobb and Syd mead, two of the greatest graphic designers ever. Then there is the Alien Queen. WOW!! Created by the late great Stan Winston, the Alien Queen is one of the most menacing creatures in movie history. She is so believable in terms of movement and motivation, she leaps off the screen at us in the audience. the James Horner's music compliments everything. It is sparse, but when it comes on it's like a hammer that gets our attention and helps the story progress. "Bishop's Countdown" is now one of the most famous tracks and trailer cues ever written, and for good reason. The horror aspects, when they happen in the film, are absolutely superb. They are so graphic and well-timed that you feel like either screaming, or getting sick. But this is necessary blood and gore, as well as making you truly care about the characters and how it successfully creates a sense of unease over who will die and who will survive. This film is a classic film in the two big ones people go to see, horror and action. The directing is great, the acting is great, the action is beyond awesome. Check it out if you want to be truly given a big dose of adrenaline.

    In some ways this is a better movie than Alien. There are characters besides Ripley you become invested in in Aliens. But, you can't beat the suspense of Alien. Alien did a great job with the unexpected betrayal of the crew android, and Aliens did a great job using the new crew android as an ally. I don't know why, but in my mind I group the little girl, Newt, from Aliens in with the Ewoks from Return of the Jedi. I found Newt unnecessary -- yes, it did bring a new dimension to Ripley, but I don't think that we needed that new dimension. Kyle Reese from Terminator has a supporting role as a near-love interest. He didn't make it all the way through the movie, but he was very good here. The fight with the Queen was drawn out, but it understandably couldn't end very quickly. Whether or not you liked Alien, I recommend Aliens. But, I definitely don't recommend the following movies. I may watch the Alien cubed because Tywin Lannister is in it, but watch at your own risk -- I've never heard good things.

    There are very few sequels in cinema that have managed to surpass the originals in the reach of their appeal and overcome the expectations of the loyal, faithful fans of the original films. James Cameron's Aliens, somehow, exactly manages to do that by taking the original story of Ridley Scott's Alien and expanding upon it in ways most sequels are afraid to. Aliens is, without a doubt, one of the best sequels ever made and just like Alien, is one of the best offerings of its or any other genre. It is set in the same universe of Alien but is way more bigger & action-packed than the original and succeeds not only as a great sci-fi horror but also re-defines the action genre. Aliens is set 57 years after the events of the first film. It begins with Ripley being rescued & revived from hyper-sleep after drifting in space for more than 50 years. After hearing her account of what happened to her former crew on Nostromo, the panel board turns down her story, revokes her space-flight license & makes her aware of the colonization of the planet LV-426, where the alien spaceship was found in the first film. Things set in motion when the contact with the colony on planet LV-426 is lost and Ripley is requested to join a group of space marines to investigate which she, after initially refusing, finally accepts in order to face & overcome her fears. While Alien gave equal importance to each of its characters, Aliens places more emphasis on Ripley and is basically her journey from undergoing severe traumatic nightmares caused due to the events of the first film to facing her fears head on in this sequel. James Cameron is an extremely talented writer-director not because he knows what great action is all about but because he's always able to back it up with a highly compelling story which is further elevated by jaw-dropping visuals. Coming from the success of The Terminator, Cameron could have easily made a loose sequel of Alien by repeating the concept of the first film but chose to do it differently by expanding the universe of the previous film and giving an insight into the evolution of the creatures as well as Ripley. While Alien was a slow building masterpiece of atmospheric tension, Aliens travels the same road to some extent but then takes a slightly different turn by replacing the survival horror of its predecessor with a highly intense, bombastic & violent war between two species, unlike anything that existed before it. There is less suspense in this film than Alien, but Cameron makes up for it by turning Aliens into an action-thriller filled with intense moments of relentless terror, highly potent combat sequences and finally culminates the story with a bone-chilling climax. The part of Ellen Ripley is brilliantly written by Cameron. He penned down Sigourney Weaver's character with extreme care & provided much more depth to Ripley. Also, her relationship with Newt in this film gave Weaver new emotional dimensions to explore. With such a layered canvas crafted by Cameron to build upon, Weaver was able to capitalize and ended up giving a truly remarkable performance, thus becoming the first real female action figure in cinema. Supporting her are other excellent performances too, especially by Carrie Henn as Newt, a traumatized young girl who is the only former survivor on the colonized planet and with whom Ripley forms a motherly bond. Lance Henriksen provides his very own dimensions to the character of Bishop, the android. The space marines have their bad-ass attitude in tact and each one of them is given a distinct trait. And the team of Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton & others did a commendable job in portraying them on-screen. Solid performances all around. As for this film's technical achievements, Aliens' art direction & set designs may not have surpassed the artistic levels set in the previous film but it certainly comes close. However, the one category where this film sets a new benchmark of its time is in its state-of-the-art visual & sound effects. Visual effects are absolutely groundbreaking and that's one part which has since become a trademark in James Cameron's films. Sound always plays a big role in combat & horror films and is impressive here as well, be it the sound of guns blazing, aliens shrieking or explosions. Cinematography successfully creates a more evolved atmosphere of what existed in the original film. Editing is cleverly done & it successfully manages to keep the viewers gripped to their seats for 2.5 hours which goes pretty unnoticed. And finally, the score perfectly balances the tone of the film and stays in sync with the film's content. It's loud, terrifying, suspenseful & also touching wherever & whenever it's supposed to be. Splendid work by composer James Horner. Even though many fans will be divided over which is a better film between Ridley Scott's Alien & James Cameron's Aliens, there is no denying that both films are masterpieces & immortal for their contribution to horror, action & science-fiction genres. And looking back, Aliens is indeed a perfect follow-up to Alien, not just because it explores the elements of the original beautifully, but also because it places greater emphasis on staying true to the original by following it up with an equally mesmerizing story rather than something made just for financial gains, like most sequels of today. Highly entertaining, immensely satisfying & a spectacular roller-coaster ride of non-stop action, Aliens refuses to age even after three decades and continues to rank amongst the most intense & fulfilling pieces of action films, ever. And a final note to whoever is reading this: Although Aliens is strong enough to be a standalone film, it still would be a wiser move to visit the original by Ridley Scott before moving on to this one. And just like Alien, James Cameron's Aliens is strongly recommended as well.

    James Cameron took over directing duties from Ridley Scott, and like the original, directs this with remarkable intensity and suspense, as Ripley is rescued from her hyper sleep, and later persuaded to return to the same alien planet where all that horror she left behind comes back multiplied, after a colony stumbles upon the same derelict ship, and comes into contact with the merciless alien creatures... A model on how to produce a sequel; continue the original, building on the plot without repeating it, while at the same time respecting the past, and putting your own stamp on things. Just like the first, this is extremely effective in story, character development, and excitement, building to an action-packed and satisfying climax. One of the finest sequels ever made!

    There is no doubt that James Cameron is a master film maker with such classic films as Terminator 1 & 2 and True Lies under his belt (which are all personal favourites of mine). He also created Aliens which is a near perfect follow up to the popular 1979 film Alien. The film begins with a salvage crew discovering a ship which Ripley (Weaver) has been drifting in for 57 years as a result of being in some sort of hyper sleep. She still has her beloved cat Jonesey from the first film who presumably must have been in a hyper sleep as well. We quickly learn that in the 57 years that Ripley has been asleep (I think only Sleeping Beauty has slept for longer than that)that there have been colonies of families that have been studying the planet where Ripley's crew discovered the Alien life forms in the first film. When contact becomes lost with the colony, a group of marines are sent in to investigate what's been going on - this is initially done as a precaution as they suspect that contact has been lost due to a faulty transmitter. Upon hearing this, Ripley isn't convinced that a faulty transmitter is to blame and she suspects that there is a possibility that the Aliens may have re-surfaced. This leads to Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) and Lt Gorman (William Hope) asking Ripley to join them as a 'consultant' as she is more knowledgeable about the Aliens and they believe that if they are out there, that she will be the best person to assist the Marines in eradicating the Aliens for good. I think there are 2 main reasons why this works better than Alien. Firstly, the pacing; Aliens gets going a lot more quickly than Alien and never dragged or became dull - this was part of the problem with Alien - the action scenes were good in Alien, but the first 45 minutes were a complete bore. Second was the action scenes - James Cameron is just so much better at creating action sequences which ultimately made Aliens a much more exciting film. One thing that was great about Alien was the direction and the way the tension was created, but James Cameron even with the faster pacing and better action sequences still managed to create arguably greater tension and even crisper direction (but what did you expect from the mastermind behind the excellent original Terminator and the masterpiece of Terminator 2 that followed). The only minor gripe that I had was the character of Hudson (portrayed by Bill Paxton). Whilst Paxton's acting was great, his character was really annoying with his constant whining and repeatedly saying 'Man' at the end of every sentence. Other than that, I will happily sing this film's praises! Whilst Aliens is undoubtedly a better film than Alien, I would recommend watching Alien before Aliens as you will have a better understanding of the themes contained in Aliens.

    This movie made such an impact on me when I saw it as a teen in 1987. That's because of the powerful story, strong characters that you care about and lots of fast paced action. And of course a truckload of one-liners (mostly from Hudson/Bill Paxton), which I still remember to this day. You can say this movie changed my life. Leave it to James Cameron to make a sequel to a classic sci-fi horror film and turn it into a action movie, that's just as good (even better I think). It ages well, even though some technology is outdated now. One of the greatest science fiction action movies ever. PS: And i'll never watch Alien 3 again. What it did to the surviving characters was unforgiving.

    People often argue the merits and their personal preference for Alien or Aliens, but not even a 57 year debate wouldn't settle that argument. I'm just glad we have two such great (and different) films to enjoy. For my two cents, although I love Alien, it's Aliens that I've comfortably watched more times. It's like a great roller coaster, once you catch a glimpse of it you need to hop on board, strap in, and enjoy the ride. Cameron was never (nor should he) going to outdo Ridley in terms of mood and atmosphere. So Cameron played to his strengths and changed gears (breaking a transaxle in the process, sorry!). What we're left with is a film that sits happily in (and adds to) the universe that Ridley and Co. so beautifully created and ranks as once of greatest action/sci-fi films ever, and certainly my favourite. So go (re)watch it!

    Ridley Scott's "Alien" was a classic sci-fi horror film. He used claustrophobic sets and atmosphere to create a creepy, modern monster film. James Cameron's "Aliens," however, is a great sci-fi action film. Both films benefit from having competent directors at the helm. Both directors take a different approach to the material, which lends each film a unique feel. We never feel like we just watched the same movie twice, nor that we saw an inferior spin-off of the first--common complaints about sequels. "Aliens" is a self-contained story. (I actually saw "Aliens" before I saw "Alien"... back in the third grade. My parents were cool like that.) The action picks up 57 years after the events in the first film. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has been in hibernation since her first ordeal with the alien. Her story of the alien is met with derision, and her bosses demote her for blowing up her ship, the Nostromo. Ripley is horrified to learn colonists have been living on the planet where her crew encountered the alien for 20 years. However, when contact breaks off with the colonists, Ripley is sent in with the Marines as a consultant to confront the aliens. The Marines find the colony devoid of life, except for one little girl, Newt, who has managed to survive by hiding in the vents. Lesser films use children as a cheap device to force the audience to care about the outcome of the story. Here, the relationship between Ripley and Newt is pivotal to showing Ripley's maternal side, which is essential to the development of the character. Cameron takes his time setting up the story and building suspense. Almost an hour passes before the first encounter with the aliens. The set-up can be perfunctory at times, with dialogue between the Marines seemingly copy-and-pasted from "Full Metal Jacket." From the midway point, however, the action doesn't let up. We sat through the slow ride to the top of the roller coaster, and it is all thrills until the end. This film is now 27 years old and was so popular that if you're reading this, you probably have already seen it. I will instead write about one of the themes of the Alien franchise that I find interesting in understanding the films. Much has been written about how the franchise is actually about rape. However, I will write about the series's feminist undertones. My Western Civ teacher at the University of Kansas, John Younger, lectured about how the feminist movement can be traced through the series. "Alien" was released in '70s, a time when the feminist movement was in its most militant phase. Ripley, a butch female, single-handedly destroys the alien (which has a penis-shaped head and penis-like extremities protruding from its body). This was after it had already killed all her male companions, proving that "women need men the way fish need bicycles." "Aliens" came out in '80s, when feminists began to embrace their femininity. We see this in the motherly role Ripley adopts toward Newt. Ripley goes alone with a pulse rifle taped to a grenade launcher to rescue Newt from the alien queen. "Alien 3" came out in '90s, when the feminist movement became more inclusive, and progressive men could actually be considered feminists. In the third installment, the men of the penal colony work together with Ripley to destroy the alien. As for the subsequent movies, it's better to just mentally erase them. The films also celebrate Native American art. Alien creator H.R. Giger was a great admirer of pre-Columbian art, and based the alien design partly on the stone reliefs of the Chav&iacute;n culture, a pre-Inca Andean society. One creature in Chav&iacute;n art is notably depicted with a mouth within its mouth. Considering these things adds layers of appreciation for the viewers. Ultimately, "Aliens" works because the filmmakers set out to make a good movie, rather than crank out a sequel simply to cash in on the success of its predecessor.

    'Aliens' came out in 1986, so the quality of it won't be as good as a movie coming out today. I'm not giving this movie any special treatment for that. I'm reviewing and rating it just like I would rate and review a movie that would come out now. Anyway, there are two types of people in the world: people who think 'Alien' is better than 'Aliens', and people who think 'Aliens' is better than 'Alien'. I don't think either of them is better than another. I watched the 1990 special addition of the movie, so it's two and a half hours long. 'Aliens' had a very slow first hour of the movie. It worked for only about twenty minutes. The movie then started dragging on for the other forty minutes. In the first twenty minutes, it was alright because the slowness hadn't gotten boring yet, it was just used to introduce new characters and go over the situation at hand. This part of the first hour was enjoyable. As it went on, though, we had already known all of the characters and there was just nothing going on. There was quite a bit of CGI used near the end of the first hour, which I think they could gone without using, because it was two-dimensional CGI. There were also green screens used, which also brought it down. That was part of the reason the forty minute boring part was bad. The other part of the reason is that it was simply unexciting. The acting in this movie had a few problems, too. A few of the actors didn't seem to give it their all. Luckily, the main actors and actresses (Sigourney Weaver, Carrie Henn, and Michael Biehn) did well. I believed those three actors and actresses were their characters. The supposed cast weren't all very good, though. In several scenes of this movie, the characters would have to be quiet to get through places, and there was no music in these parts. This made suspense build up to set up for action sequences. They executed this well in the film. It made trauma for the audience and even some intensity. That worked in the movie. They also didn't just have mindless acting in the movie. Every sequence had a reason for it's happening, which just made it more enjoyable. That brings up the quality of the acting sequences. The acting sequences were great. They had alright music for the situations and had very thrilling humans vs. aliens battle scenes. There were used of guns which brought more explosions that just made it more thrilling. Also, the humans didn't just win every time. There was an equal balance of aliens winning, too. This made the movie more thrilling and intense. It wouldn't have been good if the humans won every time. The technology used in that time period wasn't too far- fetched, either. Overall, this movie was really good. That's what my 8/10 rating means. I very much recommend 'Alien' and 'Aliens' to anyone who is thinking about watching it. I own the movie on Blu-Ray.

    For every dozen sequels that aren't as good as their originals, there comes a badass flick like Aliens that not only is as good as alien, but better in every category. The Story of Aliens is that Ripley, still haunted and traumatized after the events of the first film, is asked by her employers: The Weyland- Yutani Corporation to take a squad of colonial marines to destroy a possible Xenomorph infestation there. The performances by everyone in the cast are compelling and memorable, especially from Sigourney Weaver as Ripley who puts on one of, if not the, best performances I have ever seen on film. The sound design is also equally commendable; nothing is quite as memorable to me as the sound of a marine's pulse rifle firing, or the screeching of Xenomorphs. Speaking of Xenomorphs, I love the angle that director James Cameron took with them. We get to see more of the inner workings of their hive, how they think how they fight together, their thought process, how intelligent they can be, and just how dangerous they truly are. The story is kind of familiar (Believe me, the idea of being trapped behind enemy lines isn't exactly new here) but I think that it works to the films advantage. It takes some of those familiar themes and adds a whole new layer to them and makes them fit into the alien universe. Like the previous film it takes the familiar Good vs Evil and adds a whole new dimension to it. A connection of Vietnam can also be made to this film (If you are reading this, please don't start a flame war) I mean think about it: We have over cocky, over confident, marines going into unknown territory to fight an enemy they don't quite understand, and are defeated by the enemy that uses unconventional tactics in battle. James Cameron even said that some of the designs (Weapons, ships, etc.) Were taken from the Vietnam War. The films also takes the uncanny high levels of tension from Alien and cranks it up to a thousand. The dialogue is some of the best in cinematic history, and the characters are great as well. Another thing that must be mentioned, I also really liked the relationship between Newt and Ripley. It is portrayed realistically and adds a whole new dimension to the character of Ellen Ripley. Don't worry, Newt isn't annoying or stupid for a kid. In fact, she is actually really smart and reacts with brains instead of brawn. Hell, she even helps save Ripley at some points. Aliens is a masterpiece. Great writing, special effects, amazing gripping story, good set design, great mood and tone, action, and horror all contribute to this being one of the best film of all time. F**k those that don't like this movie, whether or not Aliens is better than Alien can actually be debated till you're black and blue in the face. But what can't be debated is that Aliens is a not only a masterpiece of science-fiction, but also a masterpiece of cinema.

    When Ridley Scott's "Alien" came out in 1979, people were thrilled and scared out of their minds by it. One of those people was Writer/Director James Cameron. He was so enamored with the world of "Alien" he decided to write a sequel to it. Then, after his first major film, "The terminator," came out Fox immediately took his script and picked him as the director. What we have here is not only one of his best movies, but one of the greatest sequels of all time. The story begins 57 years after the first film, where Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is finally rescued in her pod. the planet where the alien colony was first discovered by her and her crew, is now mining planet LV-426, which has lost contact with Earth. She is brought on as a "consultant" to a battalion of Marines and a higher-up in the company to go investigate and establish contact once again. Once they get there though, our friends with the taste for human brains (multiplied by the hundreds this time around instead of one) destroy half of the group forcing the survivors to barricade themselves to fend off the vicious monsters. One of James Cameron's claims to fame is his ability to make his characters believable. This proof comes in the form of Ripley. Sigourney Weaver plays her brilliantly, as a driven, determined, and slightly pushy bad-ass, but with a tender side to it. its a challenge for her to fit in with others in this movie. Everything she once knew is gone, and she is still having night terrors and is physically scarred by her experiences with the alien on the Nostromo. Weaver was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress, which was/still is unheard of considering what genre this movie is in. Ripley also bonds with the only survivor of the colonists, a little girl nicknamed "Newt." Again, the bond that blossoms between the two is very believable. And the supporting cast is top notch. Each marine has a memorable personality, and eventually warm up to Ripley and begin to understand the gravity of their situation in this hell-hole. Even Bishop the Android (Lance Henriksen) is given a great personality, and on that Ripley has to learn to trust after her experiences with the evil Ash in the first film. What makes this film far different from "Alien" is instead of it being a straight up horror/suspense film, the action in this movie is turned up infinitely more, and for good use. Cameron is the master of action and he uses his skills here to a great degree. The action itself plays against a larger environment, expertly designed by Peter Lamont, with he help of artists Ron Cobb and Syd mead, two of the greatest graphic designers ever. Then there is the Alien Queen. WOW!! Created by the late great Stan Winston, the Alien Queen is one of the most menacing creatures in movie history. She is so believable in terms of movement and motivation, she leaps off the screen at us in the audience. the James Horner's music compliments everything. It is sparse, but when it comes on it's like a hammer that gets our attention and helps the story progress. "Bishop's Countdown" is now one of the most famous tracks and trailer cues ever written, and for good reason. The horror aspects, when they happen in the film, are absolutely superb. They are so graphic and well-timed that you feel like either screaming, or getting sick. But this is necessary blood and gore, as well as making you truly care about the characters and how it successfully creates a sense of unease over who will die and who will survive. This film is a classic film in the two big ones people go to see, horror and action. The directing is great, the acting is great, the action is beyond awesome. Check it out if you want to be truly given a big dose of adrenaline.

    In some ways this is a better movie than Alien. There are characters besides Ripley you become invested in in Aliens. But, you can't beat the suspense of Alien. Alien did a great job with the unexpected betrayal of the crew android, and Aliens did a great job using the new crew android as an ally. I don't know why, but in my mind I group the little girl, Newt, from Aliens in with the Ewoks from Return of the Jedi. I found Newt unnecessary -- yes, it did bring a new dimension to Ripley, but I don't think that we needed that new dimension. Kyle Reese from Terminator has a supporting role as a near-love interest. He didn't make it all the way through the movie, but he was very good here. The fight with the Queen was drawn out, but it understandably couldn't end very quickly. Whether or not you liked Alien, I recommend Aliens. But, I definitely don't recommend the following movies. I may watch the Alien cubed because Tywin Lannister is in it, but watch at your own risk -- I've never heard good things.

    There are very few sequels in cinema that have managed to surpass the originals in the reach of their appeal and overcome the expectations of the loyal, faithful fans of the original films. James Cameron's Aliens, somehow, exactly manages to do that by taking the original story of Ridley Scott's Alien and expanding upon it in ways most sequels are afraid to. Aliens is, without a doubt, one of the best sequels ever made and just like Alien, is one of the best offerings of its or any other genre. It is set in the same universe of Alien but is way more bigger & action-packed than the original and succeeds not only as a great sci-fi horror but also re-defines the action genre. Aliens is set 57 years after the events of the first film. It begins with Ripley being rescued & revived from hyper-sleep after drifting in space for more than 50 years. After hearing her account of what happened to her former crew on Nostromo, the panel board turns down her story, revokes her space-flight license & makes her aware of the colonization of the planet LV-426, where the alien spaceship was found in the first film. Things set in motion when the contact with the colony on planet LV-426 is lost and Ripley is requested to join a group of space marines to investigate which she, after initially refusing, finally accepts in order to face & overcome her fears. While Alien gave equal importance to each of its characters, Aliens places more emphasis on Ripley and is basically her journey from undergoing severe traumatic nightmares caused due to the events of the first film to facing her fears head on in this sequel. James Cameron is an extremely talented writer-director not because he knows what great action is all about but because he's always able to back it up with a highly compelling story which is further elevated by jaw-dropping visuals. Coming from the success of The Terminator, Cameron could have easily made a loose sequel of Alien by repeating the concept of the first film but chose to do it differently by expanding the universe of the previous film and giving an insight into the evolution of the creatures as well as Ripley. While Alien was a slow building masterpiece of atmospheric tension, Aliens travels the same road to some extent but then takes a slightly different turn by replacing the survival horror of its predecessor with a highly intense, bombastic & violent war between two species, unlike anything that existed before it. There is less suspense in this film than Alien, but Cameron makes up for it by turning Aliens into an action-thriller filled with intense moments of relentless terror, highly potent combat sequences and finally culminates the story with a bone-chilling climax. The part of Ellen Ripley is brilliantly written by Cameron. He penned down Sigourney Weaver's character with extreme care & provided much more depth to Ripley. Also, her relationship with Newt in this film gave Weaver new emotional dimensions to explore. With such a layered canvas crafted by Cameron to build upon, Weaver was able to capitalize and ended up giving a truly remarkable performance, thus becoming the first real female action figure in cinema. Supporting her are other excellent performances too, especially by Carrie Henn as Newt, a traumatized young girl who is the only former survivor on the colonized planet and with whom Ripley forms a motherly bond. Lance Henriksen provides his very own dimensions to the character of Bishop, the android. The space marines have their bad-ass attitude in tact and each one of them is given a distinct trait. And the team of Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton & others did a commendable job in portraying them on-screen. Solid performances all around. As for this film's technical achievements, Aliens' art direction & set designs may not have surpassed the artistic levels set in the previous film but it certainly comes close. However, the one category where this film sets a new benchmark of its time is in its state-of-the-art visual & sound effects. Visual effects are absolutely groundbreaking and that's one part which has since become a trademark in James Cameron's films. Sound always plays a big role in combat & horror films and is impressive here as well, be it the sound of guns blazing, aliens shrieking or explosions. Cinematography successfully creates a more evolved atmosphere of what existed in the original film. Editing is cleverly done & it successfully manages to keep the viewers gripped to their seats for 2.5 hours which goes pretty unnoticed. And finally, the score perfectly balances the tone of the film and stays in sync with the film's content. It's loud, terrifying, suspenseful & also touching wherever & whenever it's supposed to be. Splendid work by composer James Horner. Even though many fans will be divided over which is a better film between Ridley Scott's Alien & James Cameron's Aliens, there is no denying that both films are masterpieces & immortal for their contribution to horror, action & science-fiction genres. And looking back, Aliens is indeed a perfect follow-up to Alien, not just because it explores the elements of the original beautifully, but also because it places greater emphasis on staying true to the original by following it up with an equally mesmerizing story rather than something made just for financial gains, like most sequels of today. Highly entertaining, immensely satisfying & a spectacular roller-coaster ride of non-stop action, Aliens refuses to age even after three decades and continues to rank amongst the most intense & fulfilling pieces of action films, ever. And a final note to whoever is reading this: Although Aliens is strong enough to be a standalone film, it still would be a wiser move to visit the original by Ridley Scott before moving on to this one. And just like Alien, James Cameron's Aliens is strongly recommended as well.

    James Cameron took over directing duties from Ridley Scott, and like the original, directs this with remarkable intensity and suspense, as Ripley is rescued from her hyper sleep, and later persuaded to return to the same alien planet where all that horror she left behind comes back multiplied, after a colony stumbles upon the same derelict ship, and comes into contact with the merciless alien creatures... A model on how to produce a sequel; continue the original, building on the plot without repeating it, while at the same time respecting the past, and putting your own stamp on things. Just like the first, this is extremely effective in story, character development, and excitement, building to an action-packed and satisfying climax. One of the finest sequels ever made!

    There is no doubt that James Cameron is a master film maker with such classic films as Terminator 1 & 2 and True Lies under his belt (which are all personal favourites of mine). He also created Aliens which is a near perfect follow up to the popular 1979 film Alien. The film begins with a salvage crew discovering a ship which Ripley (Weaver) has been drifting in for 57 years as a result of being in some sort of hyper sleep. She still has her beloved cat Jonesey from the first film who presumably must have been in a hyper sleep as well. We quickly learn that in the 57 years that Ripley has been asleep (I think only Sleeping Beauty has slept for longer than that)that there have been colonies of families that have been studying the planet where Ripley's crew discovered the Alien life forms in the first film. When contact becomes lost with the colony, a group of marines are sent in to investigate what's been going on - this is initially done as a precaution as they suspect that contact has been lost due to a faulty transmitter. Upon hearing this, Ripley isn't convinced that a faulty transmitter is to blame and she suspects that there is a possibility that the Aliens may have re-surfaced. This leads to Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) and Lt Gorman (William Hope) asking Ripley to join them as a 'consultant' as she is more knowledgeable about the Aliens and they believe that if they are out there, that she will be the best person to assist the Marines in eradicating the Aliens for good. I think there are 2 main reasons why this works better than Alien. Firstly, the pacing; Aliens gets going a lot more quickly than Alien and never dragged or became dull - this was part of the problem with Alien - the action scenes were good in Alien, but the first 45 minutes were a complete bore. Second was the action scenes - James Cameron is just so much better at creating action sequences which ultimately made Aliens a much more exciting film. One thing that was great about Alien was the direction and the way the tension was created, but James Cameron even with the faster pacing and better action sequences still managed to create arguably greater tension and even crisper direction (but what did you expect from the mastermind behind the excellent original Terminator and the masterpiece of Terminator 2 that followed). The only minor gripe that I had was the character of Hudson (portrayed by Bill Paxton). Whilst Paxton's acting was great, his character was really annoying with his constant whining and repeatedly saying 'Man' at the end of every sentence. Other than that, I will happily sing this film's praises! Whilst Aliens is undoubtedly a better film than Alien, I would recommend watching Alien before Aliens as you will have a better understanding of the themes contained in Aliens.

    This movie made such an impact on me when I saw it as a teen in 1987. That's because of the powerful story, strong characters that you care about and lots of fast paced action. And of course a truckload of one-liners (mostly from Hudson/Bill Paxton), which I still remember to this day. You can say this movie changed my life. Leave it to James Cameron to make a sequel to a classic sci-fi horror film and turn it into a action movie, that's just as good (even better I think). It ages well, even though some technology is outdated now. One of the greatest science fiction action movies ever. PS: And i'll never watch Alien 3 again. What it did to the surviving characters was unforgiving.

    People often argue the merits and their personal preference for Alien or Aliens, but not even a 57 year debate wouldn't settle that argument. I'm just glad we have two such great (and different) films to enjoy. For my two cents, although I love Alien, it's Aliens that I've comfortably watched more times. It's like a great roller coaster, once you catch a glimpse of it you need to hop on board, strap in, and enjoy the ride. Cameron was never (nor should he) going to outdo Ridley in terms of mood and atmosphere. So Cameron played to his strengths and changed gears (breaking a transaxle in the process, sorry!). What we're left with is a film that sits happily in (and adds to) the universe that Ridley and Co. so beautifully created and ranks as once of greatest action/sci-fi films ever, and certainly my favourite. So go (re)watch it!

    Ridley Scott's "Alien" was a classic sci-fi horror film. He used claustrophobic sets and atmosphere to create a creepy, modern monster film. James Cameron's "Aliens," however, is a great sci-fi action film. Both films benefit from having competent directors at the helm. Both directors take a different approach to the material, which lends each film a unique feel. We never feel like we just watched the same movie twice, nor that we saw an inferior spin-off of the first--common complaints about sequels. "Aliens" is a self-contained story. (I actually saw "Aliens" before I saw "Alien"... back in the third grade. My parents were cool like that.) The action picks up 57 years after the events in the first film. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has been in hibernation since her first ordeal with the alien. Her story of the alien is met with derision, and her bosses demote her for blowing up her ship, the Nostromo. Ripley is horrified to learn colonists have been living on the planet where her crew encountered the alien for 20 years. However, when contact breaks off with the colonists, Ripley is sent in with the Marines as a consultant to confront the aliens. The Marines find the colony devoid of life, except for one little girl, Newt, who has managed to survive by hiding in the vents. Lesser films use children as a cheap device to force the audience to care about the outcome of the story. Here, the relationship between Ripley and Newt is pivotal to showing Ripley's maternal side, which is essential to the development of the character. Cameron takes his time setting up the story and building suspense. Almost an hour passes before the first encounter with the aliens. The set-up can be perfunctory at times, with dialogue between the Marines seemingly copy-and-pasted from "Full Metal Jacket." From the midway point, however, the action doesn't let up. We sat through the slow ride to the top of the roller coaster, and it is all thrills until the end. This film is now 27 years old and was so popular that if you're reading this, you probably have already seen it. I will instead write about one of the themes of the Alien franchise that I find interesting in understanding the films. Much has been written about how the franchise is actually about rape. However, I will write about the series's feminist undertones. My Western Civ teacher at the University of Kansas, John Younger, lectured about how the feminist movement can be traced through the series. "Alien" was released in '70s, a time when the feminist movement was in its most militant phase. Ripley, a butch female, single-handedly destroys the alien (which has a penis-shaped head and penis-like extremities protruding from its body). This was after it had already killed all her male companions, proving that "women need men the way fish need bicycles." "Aliens" came out in '80s, when feminists began to embrace their femininity. We see this in the motherly role Ripley adopts toward Newt. Ripley goes alone with a pulse rifle taped to a grenade launcher to rescue Newt from the alien queen. "Alien 3" came out in '90s, when the feminist movement became more inclusive, and progressive men could actually be considered feminists. In the third installment, the men of the penal colony work together with Ripley to destroy the alien. As for the subsequent movies, it's better to just mentally erase them. The films also celebrate Native American art. Alien creator H.R. Giger was a great admirer of pre-Columbian art, and based the alien design partly on the stone reliefs of the Chav&iacute;n culture, a pre-Inca Andean society. One creature in Chav&iacute;n art is notably depicted with a mouth within its mouth. Considering these things adds layers of appreciation for the viewers. Ultimately, "Aliens" works because the filmmakers set out to make a good movie, rather than crank out a sequel simply to cash in on the success of its predecessor.

    'Aliens' came out in 1986, so the quality of it won't be as good as a movie coming out today. I'm not giving this movie any special treatment for that. I'm reviewing and rating it just like I would rate and review a movie that would come out now. Anyway, there are two types of people in the world: people who think 'Alien' is better than 'Aliens', and people who think 'Aliens' is better than 'Alien'. I don't think either of them is better than another. I watched the 1990 special addition of the movie, so it's two and a half hours long. 'Aliens' had a very slow first hour of the movie. It worked for only about twenty minutes. The movie then started dragging on for the other forty minutes. In the first twenty minutes, it was alright because the slowness hadn't gotten boring yet, it was just used to introduce new characters and go over the situation at hand. This part of the first hour was enjoyable. As it went on, though, we had already known all of the characters and there was just nothing going on. There was quite a bit of CGI used near the end of the first hour, which I think they could gone without using, because it was two-dimensional CGI. There were also green screens used, which also brought it down. That was part of the reason the forty minute boring part was bad. The other part of the reason is that it was simply unexciting. The acting in this movie had a few problems, too. A few of the actors didn't seem to give it their all. Luckily, the main actors and actresses (Sigourney Weaver, Carrie Henn, and Michael Biehn) did well. I believed those three actors and actresses were their characters. The supposed cast weren't all very good, though. In several scenes of this movie, the characters would have to be quiet to get through places, and there was no music in these parts. This made suspense build up to set up for action sequences. They executed this well in the film. It made trauma for the audience and even some intensity. That worked in the movie. They also didn't just have mindless acting in the movie. Every sequence had a reason for it's happening, which just made it more enjoyable. That brings up the quality of the acting sequences. The acting sequences were great. They had alright music for the situations and had very thrilling humans vs. aliens battle scenes. There were used of guns which brought more explosions that just made it more thrilling. Also, the humans didn't just win every time. There was an equal balance of aliens winning, too. This made the movie more thrilling and intense. It wouldn't have been good if the humans won every time. The technology used in that time period wasn't too far- fetched, either. Overall, this movie was really good. That's what my 8/10 rating means. I very much recommend 'Alien' and 'Aliens' to anyone who is thinking about watching it. I own the movie on Blu-Ray.

    For every dozen sequels that aren't as good as their originals, there comes a badass flick like Aliens that not only is as good as alien, but better in every category. The Story of Aliens is that Ripley, still haunted and traumatized after the events of the first film, is asked by her employers: The Weyland- Yutani Corporation to take a squad of colonial marines to destroy a possible Xenomorph infestation there. The performances by everyone in the cast are compelling and memorable, especially from Sigourney Weaver as Ripley who puts on one of, if not the, best performances I have ever seen on film. The sound design is also equally commendable; nothing is quite as memorable to me as the sound of a marine's pulse rifle firing, or the screeching of Xenomorphs. Speaking of Xenomorphs, I love the angle that director James Cameron took with them. We get to see more of the inner workings of their hive, how they think how they fight together, their thought process, how intelligent they can be, and just how dangerous they truly are. The story is kind of familiar (Believe me, the idea of being trapped behind enemy lines isn't exactly new here) but I think that it works to the films advantage. It takes some of those familiar themes and adds a whole new layer to them and makes them fit into the alien universe. Like the previous film it takes the familiar Good vs Evil and adds a whole new dimension to it. A connection of Vietnam can also be made to this film (If you are reading this, please don't start a flame war) I mean think about it: We have over cocky, over confident, marines going into unknown territory to fight an enemy they don't quite understand, and are defeated by the enemy that uses unconventional tactics in battle. James Cameron even said that some of the designs (Weapons, ships, etc.) Were taken from the Vietnam War. The films also takes the uncanny high levels of tension from Alien and cranks it up to a thousand. The dialogue is some of the best in cinematic history, and the characters are great as well. Another thing that must be mentioned, I also really liked the relationship between Newt and Ripley. It is portrayed realistically and adds a whole new dimension to the character of Ellen Ripley. Don't worry, Newt isn't annoying or stupid for a kid. In fact, she is actually really smart and reacts with brains instead of brawn. Hell, she even helps save Ripley at some points. Aliens is a masterpiece. Great writing, special effects, amazing gripping story, good set design, great mood and tone, action, and horror all contribute to this being one of the best film of all time. F**k those that don't like this movie, whether or not Aliens is better than Alien can actually be debated till you're black and blue in the face. But what can't be debated is that Aliens is a not only a masterpiece of science-fiction, but also a masterpiece of cinema.

It is sparse, but when it comes on it's like a hammer that gets our attention and helps the story progress. "Bishop's Countdown" is now one of the most famous tracks and trailer cues ever written, and for good reason. The horror aspects, when they happen in the film, are absolutely superb. They are so graphic and well-timed that you feel like either screaming, or getting sick. But this is necessary blood and gore, as well as making you truly care about the characters and how it successfully creates a sense of unease over who will die and who will survive. This film is a classic film in the two big ones people go to see, horror and action. The directing is great, the acting is great, the action is beyond awesome. Check it out if you want to be truly given a big dose of adrenaline.

    In some ways this is a better movie than Alien. There are characters besides Ripley you become invested in in Aliens. But, you can't beat the suspense of Alien. Alien did a great job with the unexpected betrayal of the crew android, and Aliens did a great job using the new crew android as an ally. I don't know why, but in my mind I group the little girl, Newt, from Aliens in with the Ewoks from Return of the Jedi. I found Newt unnecessary -- yes, it did bring a new dimension to Ripley, but I don't think that we needed that new dimension. Kyle Reese from Terminator has a supporting role as a near-love interest. He didn't make it all the way through the movie, but he was very good here. The fight with the Queen was drawn out, but it understandably couldn't end very quickly. Whether or not you liked Alien, I recommend Aliens. But, I definitely don't recommend the following movies. I may watch the Alien cubed because Tywin Lannister is in it, but watch at your own risk -- I've never heard good things.

    There are very few sequels in cinema that have managed to surpass the originals in the reach of their appeal and overcome the expectations of the loyal, faithful fans of the original films. James Cameron's Aliens, somehow, exactly manages to do that by taking the original story of Ridley Scott's Alien and expanding upon it in ways most sequels are afraid to. Aliens is, without a doubt, one of the best sequels ever made and just like Alien, is one of the best offerings of its or any other genre. It is set in the same universe of Alien but is way more bigger & action-packed than the original and succeeds not only as a great sci-fi horror but also re-defines the action genre. Aliens is set 57 years after the events of the first film. It begins with Ripley being rescued & revived from hyper-sleep after drifting in space for more than 50 years. After hearing her account of what happened to her former crew on Nostromo, the panel board turns down her story, revokes her space-flight license & makes her aware of the colonization of the planet LV-426, where the alien spaceship was found in the first film. Things set in motion when the contact with the colony on planet LV-426 is lost and Ripley is requested to join a group of space marines to investigate which she, after initially refusing, finally accepts in order to face & overcome her fears. While Alien gave equal importance to each of its characters, Aliens places more emphasis on Ripley and is basically her journey from undergoing severe traumatic nightmares caused due to the events of the first film to facing her fears head on in this sequel. James Cameron is an extremely talented writer-director not because he knows what great action is all about but because he's always able to back it up with a highly compelling story which is further elevated by jaw-dropping visuals. Coming from the success of The Terminator, Cameron could have easily made a loose sequel of Alien by repeating the concept of the first film but chose to do it differently by expanding the universe of the previous film and giving an insight into the evolution of the creatures as well as Ripley. While Alien was a slow building masterpiece of atmospheric tension, Aliens travels the same road to some extent but then takes a slightly different turn by replacing the survival horror of its predecessor with a highly intense, bombastic & violent war between two species, unlike anything that existed before it. There is less suspense in this film than Alien, but Cameron makes up for it by turning Aliens into an action-thriller filled with intense moments of relentless terror, highly potent combat sequences and finally culminates the story with a bone-chilling climax. The part of Ellen Ripley is brilliantly written by Cameron. He penned down Sigourney Weaver's character with extreme care & provided much more depth to Ripley. Also, her relationship with Newt in this film gave Weaver new emotional dimensions to explore. With such a layered canvas crafted by Cameron to build upon, Weaver was able to capitalize and ended up giving a truly remarkable performance, thus becoming the first real female action figure in cinema. Supporting her are other excellent performances too, especially by Carrie Henn as Newt, a traumatized young girl who is the only former survivor on the colonized planet and with whom Ripley forms a motherly bond. Lance Henriksen provides his very own dimensions to the character of Bishop, the android. The space marines have their bad-ass attitude in tact and each one of them is given a distinct trait. And the team of Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton & others did a commendable job in portraying them on-screen. Solid performances all around. As for this film's technical achievements, Aliens' art direction & set designs may not have surpassed the artistic levels set in the previous film but it certainly comes close. However, the one category where this film sets a new benchmark of its time is in its state-of-the-art visual & sound effects. Visual effects are absolutely groundbreaking and that's one part which has since become a trademark in James Cameron's films. Sound always plays a big role in combat & horror films and is impressive here as well, be it the sound of guns blazing, aliens shrieking or explosions. Cinematography successfully creates a more evolved atmosphere of what existed in the original film. Editing is cleverly done & it successfully manages to keep the viewers gripped to their seats for 2.5 hours which goes pretty unnoticed. And finally, the score perfectly balances the tone of the film and stays in sync with the film's content. It's loud, terrifying, suspenseful & also touching wherever & whenever it's supposed to be. Splendid work by composer James Horner. Even though many fans will be divided over which is a better film between Ridley Scott's Alien & James Cameron's Aliens, there is no denying that both films are masterpieces & immortal for their contribution to horror, action & science-fiction genres. And looking back, Aliens is indeed a perfect follow-up to Alien, not just because it explores the elements of the original beautifully, but also because it places greater emphasis on staying true to the original by following it up with an equally mesmerizing story rather than something made just for financial gains, like most sequels of today. Highly entertaining, immensely satisfying & a spectacular roller-coaster ride of non-stop action, Aliens refuses to age even after three decades and continues to rank amongst the most intense & fulfilling pieces of action films, ever. And a final note to whoever is reading this: Although Aliens is strong enough to be a standalone film, it still would be a wiser move to visit the original by Ridley Scott before moving on to this one. And just like Alien, James Cameron's Aliens is strongly recommended as well.

    James Cameron took over directing duties from Ridley Scott, and like the original, directs this with remarkable intensity and suspense, as Ripley is rescued from her hyper sleep, and later persuaded to return to the same alien planet where all that horror she left behind comes back multiplied, after a colony stumbles upon the same derelict ship, and comes into contact with the merciless alien creatures... A model on how to produce a sequel; continue the original, building on the plot without repeating it, while at the same time respecting the past, and putting your own stamp on things. Just like the first, this is extremely effective in story, character development, and excitement, building to an action-packed and satisfying climax. One of the finest sequels ever made!

    There is no doubt that James Cameron is a master film maker with such classic films as Terminator 1 & 2 and True Lies under his belt (which are all personal favourites of mine). He also created Aliens which is a near perfect follow up to the popular 1979 film Alien. The film begins with a salvage crew discovering a ship which Ripley (Weaver) has been drifting in for 57 years as a result of being in some sort of hyper sleep. She still has her beloved cat Jonesey from the first film who presumably must have been in a hyper sleep as well. We quickly learn that in the 57 years that Ripley has been asleep (I think only Sleeping Beauty has slept for longer than that)that there have been colonies of families that have been studying the planet where Ripley's crew discovered the Alien life forms in the first film. When contact becomes lost with the colony, a group of marines are sent in to investigate what's been going on - this is initially done as a precaution as they suspect that contact has been lost due to a faulty transmitter. Upon hearing this, Ripley isn't convinced that a faulty transmitter is to blame and she suspects that there is a possibility that the Aliens may have re-surfaced. This leads to Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) and Lt Gorman (William Hope) asking Ripley to join them as a 'consultant' as she is more knowledgeable about the Aliens and they believe that if they are out there, that she will be the best person to assist the Marines in eradicating the Aliens for good. I think there are 2 main reasons why this works better than Alien. Firstly, the pacing; Aliens gets going a lot more quickly than Alien and never dragged or became dull - this was part of the problem with Alien - the action scenes were good in Alien, but the first 45 minutes were a complete bore. Second was the action scenes - James Cameron is just so much better at creating action sequences which ultimately made Aliens a much more exciting film. One thing that was great about Alien was the direction and the way the tension was created, but James Cameron even with the faster pacing and better action sequences still managed to create arguably greater tension and even crisper direction (but what did you expect from the mastermind behind the excellent original Terminator and the masterpiece of Terminator 2 that followed). The only minor gripe that I had was the character of Hudson (portrayed by Bill Paxton). Whilst Paxton's acting was great, his character was really annoying with his constant whining and repeatedly saying 'Man' at the end of every sentence. Other than that, I will happily sing this film's praises! Whilst Aliens is undoubtedly a better film than Alien, I would recommend watching Alien before Aliens as you will have a better understanding of the themes contained in Aliens.

    This movie made such an impact on me when I saw it as a teen in 1987. That's because of the powerful story, strong characters that you care about and lots of fast paced action. And of course a truckload of one-liners (mostly from Hudson/Bill Paxton), which I still remember to this day. You can say this movie changed my life. Leave it to James Cameron to make a sequel to a classic sci-fi horror film and turn it into a action movie, that's just as good (even better I think). It ages well, even though some technology is outdated now. One of the greatest science fiction action movies ever. PS: And i'll never watch Alien 3 again. What it did to the surviving characters was unforgiving.

    People often argue the merits and their personal preference for Alien or Aliens, but not even a 57 year debate wouldn't settle that argument. I'm just glad we have two such great (and different) films to enjoy. For my two cents, although I love Alien, it's Aliens that I've comfortably watched more times. It's like a great roller coaster, once you catch a glimpse of it you need to hop on board, strap in, and enjoy the ride. Cameron was never (nor should he) going to outdo Ridley in terms of mood and atmosphere. So Cameron played to his strengths and changed gears (breaking a transaxle in the process, sorry!). What we're left with is a film that sits happily in (and adds to) the universe that Ridley and Co. so beautifully created and ranks as once of greatest action/sci-fi films ever, and certainly my favourite. So go (re)watch it!

    Ridley Scott's "Alien" was a classic sci-fi horror film. He used claustrophobic sets and atmosphere to create a creepy, modern monster film. James Cameron's "Aliens," however, is a great sci-fi action film. Both films benefit from having competent directors at the helm. Both directors take a different approach to the material, which lends each film a unique feel. We never feel like we just watched the same movie twice, nor that we saw an inferior spin-off of the first--common complaints about sequels. "Aliens" is a self-contained story. (I actually saw "Aliens" before I saw "Alien"... back in the third grade. My parents were cool like that.) The action picks up 57 years after the events in the first film. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has been in hibernation since her first ordeal with the alien. Her story of the alien is met with derision, and her bosses demote her for blowing up her ship, the Nostromo. Ripley is horrified to learn colonists have been living on the planet where her crew encountered the alien for 20 years. However, when contact breaks off with the colonists, Ripley is sent in with the Marines as a consultant to confront the aliens. The Marines find the colony devoid of life, except for one little girl, Newt, who has managed to survive by hiding in the vents. Lesser films use children as a cheap device to force the audience to care about the outcome of the story. Here, the relationship between Ripley and Newt is pivotal to showing Ripley's maternal side, which is essential to the development of the character. Cameron takes his time setting up the story and building suspense. Almost an hour passes before the first encounter with the aliens. The set-up can be perfunctory at times, with dialogue between the Marines seemingly copy-and-pasted from "Full Metal Jacket." From the midway point, however, the action doesn't let up. We sat through the slow ride to the top of the roller coaster, and it is all thrills until the end. This film is now 27 years old and was so popular that if you're reading this, you probably have already seen it. I will instead write about one of the themes of the Alien franchise that I find interesting in understanding the films. Much has been written about how the franchise is actually about rape. However, I will write about the series's feminist undertones. My Western Civ teacher at the University of Kansas, John Younger, lectured about how the feminist movement can be traced through the series. "Alien" was released in '70s, a time when the feminist movement was in its most militant phase. Ripley, a butch female, single-handedly destroys the alien (which has a penis-shaped head and penis-like extremities protruding from its body). This was after it had already killed all her male companions, proving that "women need men the way fish need bicycles." "Aliens" came out in '80s, when feminists began to embrace their femininity. We see this in the motherly role Ripley adopts toward Newt. Ripley goes alone with a pulse rifle taped to a grenade launcher to rescue Newt from the alien queen. "Alien 3" came out in '90s, when the feminist movement became more inclusive, and progressive men could actually be considered feminists. In the third installment, the men of the penal colony work together with Ripley to destroy the alien. As for the subsequent movies, it's better to just mentally erase them. The films also celebrate Native American art. Alien creator H.R. Giger was a great admirer of pre-Columbian art, and based the alien design partly on the stone reliefs of the Chav&iacute;n culture, a pre-Inca Andean society. One creature in Chav&iacute;n art is notably depicted with a mouth within its mouth. Considering these things adds layers of appreciation for the viewers. Ultimately, "Aliens" works because the filmmakers set out to make a good movie, rather than crank out a sequel simply to cash in on the success of its predecessor.

    'Aliens' came out in 1986, so the quality of it won't be as good as a movie coming out today. I'm not giving this movie any special treatment for that. I'm reviewing and rating it just like I would rate and review a movie that would come out now. Anyway, there are two types of people in the world: people who think 'Alien' is better than 'Aliens', and people who think 'Aliens' is better than 'Alien'. I don't think either of them is better than another. I watched the 1990 special addition of the movie, so it's two and a half hours long. 'Aliens' had a very slow first hour of the movie. It worked for only about twenty minutes. The movie then started dragging on for the other forty minutes. In the first twenty minutes, it was alright because the slowness hadn't gotten boring yet, it was just used to introduce new characters and go over the situation at hand. This part of the first hour was enjoyable. As it went on, though, we had already known all of the characters and there was just nothing going on. There was quite a bit of CGI used near the end of the first hour, which I think they could gone without using, because it was two-dimensional CGI. There were also green screens used, which also brought it down. That was part of the reason the forty minute boring part was bad. The other part of the reason is that it was simply unexciting. The acting in this movie had a few problems, too. A few of the actors didn't seem to give it their all. Luckily, the main actors and actresses (Sigourney Weaver, Carrie Henn, and Michael Biehn) did well. I believed those three actors and actresses were their characters. The supposed cast weren't all very good, though. In several scenes of this movie, the characters would have to be quiet to get through places, and there was no music in these parts. This made suspense build up to set up for action sequences. They executed this well in the film. It made trauma for the audience and even some intensity. That worked in the movie. They also didn't just have mindless acting in the movie. Every sequence had a reason for it's happening, which just made it more enjoyable. That brings up the quality of the acting sequences. The acting sequences were great. They had alright music for the situations and had very thrilling humans vs. aliens battle scenes. There were used of guns which brought more explosions that just made it more thrilling. Also, the humans didn't just win every time. There was an equal balance of aliens winning, too. This made the movie more thrilling and intense. It wouldn't have been good if the humans won every time. The technology used in that time period wasn't too far- fetched, either. Overall, this movie was really good. That's what my 8/10 rating means. I very much recommend 'Alien' and 'Aliens' to anyone who is thinking about watching it. I own the movie on Blu-Ray.

    For every dozen sequels that aren't as good as their originals, there comes a badass flick like Aliens that not only is as good as alien, but better in every category. The Story of Aliens is that Ripley, still haunted and traumatized after the events of the first film, is asked by her employers: The Weyland- Yutani Corporation to take a squad of colonial marines to destroy a possible Xenomorph infestation there. The performances by everyone in the cast are compelling and memorable, especially from Sigourney Weaver as Ripley who puts on one of, if not the, best performances I have ever seen on film. The sound design is also equally commendable; nothing is quite as memorable to me as the sound of a marine's pulse rifle firing, or the screeching of Xenomorphs. Speaking of Xenomorphs, I love the angle that director James Cameron took with them. We get to see more of the inner workings of their hive, how they think how they fight together, their thought process, how intelligent they can be, and just how dangerous they truly are. The story is kind of familiar (Believe me, the idea of being trapped behind enemy lines isn't exactly new here) but I think that it works to the films advantage. It takes some of those familiar themes and adds a whole new layer to them and makes them fit into the alien universe. Like the previous film it takes the familiar Good vs Evil and adds a whole new dimension to it. A connection of Vietnam can also be made to this film (If you are reading this, please don't start a flame war) I mean think about it: We have over cocky, over confident, marines going into unknown territory to fight an enemy they don't quite understand, and are defeated by the enemy that uses unconventional tactics in battle. James Cameron even said that some of the designs (Weapons, ships, etc.) Were taken from the Vietnam War. The films also takes the uncanny high levels of tension from Alien and cranks it up to a thousand. The dialogue is some of the best in cinematic history, and the characters are great as well. Another thing that must be mentioned, I also really liked the relationship between Newt and Ripley. It is portrayed realistically and adds a whole new dimension to the character of Ellen Ripley. Don't worry, Newt isn't annoying or stupid for a kid. In fact, she is actually really smart and reacts with brains instead of brawn. Hell, she even helps save Ripley at some points. Aliens is a masterpiece. Great writing, special effects, amazing gripping story, good set design, great mood and tone, action, and horror all contribute to this being one of the best film of all time. F**k those that don't like this movie, whether or not Aliens is better than Alien can actually be debated till you're black and blue in the face. But what can't be debated is that Aliens is a not only a masterpiece of science-fiction, but also a masterpiece of cinema.

    When Ridley Scott's "Alien" came out in 1979, people were thrilled and scared out of their minds by it. One of those people was Writer/Director James Cameron. He was so enamored with the world of "Alien" he decided to write a sequel to it. Then, after his first major film, "The terminator," came out Fox immediately took his script and picked him as the director. What we have here is not only one of his best movies, but one of the greatest sequels of all time. The story begins 57 years after the first film, where Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is finally rescued in her pod. the planet where the alien colony was first discovered by her and her crew, is now mining planet LV-426, which has lost contact with Earth. She is brought on as a "consultant" to a battalion of Marines and a higher-up in the company to go investigate and establish contact once again. Once they get there though, our friends with the taste for human brains (multiplied by the hundreds this time around instead of one) destroy half of the group forcing the survivors to barricade themselves to fend off the vicious monsters. One of James Cameron's claims to fame is his ability to make his characters believable. This proof comes in the form of Ripley. Sigourney Weaver plays her brilliantly, as a driven, determined, and slightly pushy bad-ass, but with a tender side to it. its a challenge for her to fit in with others in this movie. Everything she once knew is gone, and she is still having night terrors and is physically scarred by her experiences with the alien on the Nostromo. Weaver was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress, which was/still is unheard of considering what genre this movie is in. Ripley also bonds with the only survivor of the colonists, a little girl nicknamed "Newt." Again, the bond that blossoms between the two is very believable. And the supporting cast is top notch. Each marine has a memorable personality, and eventually warm up to Ripley and begin to understand the gravity of their situation in this hell-hole. Even Bishop the Android (Lance Henriksen) is given a great personality, and on that Ripley has to learn to trust after her experiences with the evil Ash in the first film. What makes this film far different from "Alien" is instead of it being a straight up horror/suspense film, the action in this movie is turned up infinitely more, and for good use. Cameron is the master of action and he uses his skills here to a great degree. The action itself plays against a larger environment, expertly designed by Peter Lamont, with he help of artists Ron Cobb and Syd mead, two of the greatest graphic designers ever. Then there is the Alien Queen. WOW!! Created by the late great Stan Winston, the Alien Queen is one of the most menacing creatures in movie history. She is so believable in terms of movement and motivation, she leaps off the screen at us in the audience. the James Horner's music compliments everything. It is sparse, but when it comes on it's like a hammer that gets our attention and helps the story progress. "Bishop's Countdown" is now one of the most famous tracks and trailer cues ever written, and for good reason. The horror aspects, when they happen in the film, are absolutely superb. They are so graphic and well-timed that you feel like either screaming, or getting sick. But this is necessary blood and gore, as well as making you truly care about the characters and how it successfully creates a sense of unease over who will die and who will survive. This film is a classic film in the two big ones people go to see, horror and action. The directing is great, the acting is great, the action is beyond awesome. Check it out if you want to be truly given a big dose of adrenaline.

    In some ways this is a better movie than Alien. There are characters besides Ripley you become invested in in Aliens. But, you can't beat the suspense of Alien. Alien did a great job with the unexpected betrayal of the crew android, and Aliens did a great job using the new crew android as an ally. I don't know why, but in my mind I group the little girl, Newt, from Aliens in with the Ewoks from Return of the Jedi. I found Newt unnecessary -- yes, it did bring a new dimension to Ripley, but I don't think that we needed that new dimension. Kyle Reese from Terminator has a supporting role as a near-love interest. He didn't make it all the way through the movie, but he was very good here. The fight with the Queen was drawn out, but it understandably couldn't end very quickly. Whether or not you liked Alien, I recommend Aliens. But, I definitely don't recommend the following movies. I may watch the Alien cubed because Tywin Lannister is in it, but watch at your own risk -- I've never heard good things.

And looking back, Aliens is indeed a perfect follow-up to Alien, not just because it explores the elements of the original beautifully, but also because it places greater emphasis on staying true to the original by following it up with an equally mesmerizing story rather than something made just for financial gains, like most sequels of today. Highly entertaining, immensely satisfying & a spectacular roller-coaster ride of non-stop action, Aliens refuses to age even after three decades and continues to rank amongst the most intense & fulfilling pieces of action films, ever. And a final note to whoever is reading this: Although Aliens is strong enough to be a standalone film, it still would be a wiser move to visit the original by Ridley Scott before moving on to this one. And just like Alien, James Cameron's Aliens is strongly recommended as well.

    James Cameron took over directing duties from Ridley Scott, and like the original, directs this with remarkable intensity and suspense, as Ripley is rescued from her hyper sleep, and later persuaded to return to the same alien planet where all that horror she left behind comes back multiplied, after a colony stumbles upon the same derelict ship, and comes into contact with the merciless alien creatures... A model on how to produce a sequel; continue the original, building on the plot without repeating it, while at the same time respecting the past, and putting your own stamp on things. Just like the first, this is extremely effective in story, character development, and excitement, building to an action-packed and satisfying climax. One of the finest sequels ever made!

    There is no doubt that James Cameron is a master film maker with such classic films as Terminator 1 & 2 and True Lies under his belt (which are all personal favourites of mine). He also created Aliens which is a near perfect follow up to the popular 1979 film Alien. The film begins with a salvage crew discovering a ship which Ripley (Weaver) has been drifting in for 57 years as a result of being in some sort of hyper sleep. She still has her beloved cat Jonesey from the first film who presumably must have been in a hyper sleep as well. We quickly learn that in the 57 years that Ripley has been asleep (I think only Sleeping Beauty has slept for longer than that)that there have been colonies of families that have been studying the planet where Ripley's crew discovered the Alien life forms in the first film. When contact becomes lost with the colony, a group of marines are sent in to investigate what's been going on - this is initially done as a precaution as they suspect that contact has been lost due to a faulty transmitter. Upon hearing this, Ripley isn't convinced that a faulty transmitter is to blame and she suspects that there is a possibility that the Aliens may have re-surfaced. This leads to Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) and Lt Gorman (William Hope) asking Ripley to join them as a 'consultant' as she is more knowledgeable about the Aliens and they believe that if they are out there, that she will be the best person to assist the Marines in eradicating the Aliens for good. I think there are 2 main reasons why this works better than Alien. Firstly, the pacing; Aliens gets going a lot more quickly than Alien and never dragged or became dull - this was part of the problem with Alien - the action scenes were good in Alien, but the first 45 minutes were a complete bore. Second was the action scenes - James Cameron is just so much better at creating action sequences which ultimately made Aliens a much more exciting film. One thing that was great about Alien was the direction and the way the tension was created, but James Cameron even with the faster pacing and better action sequences still managed to create arguably greater tension and even crisper direction (but what did you expect from the mastermind behind the excellent original Terminator and the masterpiece of Terminator 2 that followed). The only minor gripe that I had was the character of Hudson (portrayed by Bill Paxton). Whilst Paxton's acting was great, his character was really annoying with his constant whining and repeatedly saying 'Man' at the end of every sentence. Other than that, I will happily sing this film's praises! Whilst Aliens is undoubtedly a better film than Alien, I would recommend watching Alien before Aliens as you will have a better understanding of the themes contained in Aliens.

    This movie made such an impact on me when I saw it as a teen in 1987. That's because of the powerful story, strong characters that you care about and lots of fast paced action. And of course a truckload of one-liners (mostly from Hudson/Bill Paxton), which I still remember to this day. You can say this movie changed my life. Leave it to James Cameron to make a sequel to a classic sci-fi horror film and turn it into a action movie, that's just as good (even better I think). It ages well, even though some technology is outdated now. One of the greatest science fiction action movies ever. PS: And i'll never watch Alien 3 again. What it did to the surviving characters was unforgiving.

    People often argue the merits and their personal preference for Alien or Aliens, but not even a 57 year debate wouldn't settle that argument. I'm just glad we have two such great (and different) films to enjoy. For my two cents, although I love Alien, it's Aliens that I've comfortably watched more times. It's like a great roller coaster, once you catch a glimpse of it you need to hop on board, strap in, and enjoy the ride. Cameron was never (nor should he) going to outdo Ridley in terms of mood and atmosphere. So Cameron played to his strengths and changed gears (breaking a transaxle in the process, sorry!). What we're left with is a film that sits happily in (and adds to) the universe that Ridley and Co. so beautifully created and ranks as once of greatest action/sci-fi films ever, and certainly my favourite. So go (re)watch it!

    Ridley Scott's "Alien" was a classic sci-fi horror film. He used claustrophobic sets and atmosphere to create a creepy, modern monster film. James Cameron's "Aliens," however, is a great sci-fi action film. Both films benefit from having competent directors at the helm. Both directors take a different approach to the material, which lends each film a unique feel. We never feel like we just watched the same movie twice, nor that we saw an inferior spin-off of the first--common complaints about sequels. "Aliens" is a self-contained story. (I actually saw "Aliens" before I saw "Alien"... back in the third grade. My parents were cool like that.) The action picks up 57 years after the events in the first film. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has been in hibernation since her first ordeal with the alien. Her story of the alien is met with derision, and her bosses demote her for blowing up her ship, the Nostromo. Ripley is horrified to learn colonists have been living on the planet where her crew encountered the alien for 20 years. However, when contact breaks off with the colonists, Ripley is sent in with the Marines as a consultant to confront the aliens. The Marines find the colony devoid of life, except for one little girl, Newt, who has managed to survive by hiding in the vents. Lesser films use children as a cheap device to force the audience to care about the outcome of the story. Here, the relationship between Ripley and Newt is pivotal to showing Ripley's maternal side, which is essential to the development of the character. Cameron takes his time setting up the story and building suspense. Almost an hour passes before the first encounter with the aliens. The set-up can be perfunctory at times, with dialogue between the Marines seemingly copy-and-pasted from "Full Metal Jacket." From the midway point, however, the action doesn't let up. We sat through the slow ride to the top of the roller coaster, and it is all thrills until the end. This film is now 27 years old and was so popular that if you're reading this, you probably have already seen it. I will instead write about one of the themes of the Alien franchise that I find interesting in understanding the films. Much has been written about how the franchise is actually about rape. However, I will write about the series's feminist undertones. My Western Civ teacher at the University of Kansas, John Younger, lectured about how the feminist movement can be traced through the series. "Alien" was released in '70s, a time when the feminist movement was in its most militant phase. Ripley, a butch female, single-handedly destroys the alien (which has a penis-shaped head and penis-like extremities protruding from its body). This was after it had already killed all her male companions, proving that "women need men the way fish need bicycles." "Aliens" came out in '80s, when feminists began to embrace their femininity. We see this in the motherly role Ripley adopts toward Newt. Ripley goes alone with a pulse rifle taped to a grenade launcher to rescue Newt from the alien queen. "Alien 3" came out in '90s, when the feminist movement became more inclusive, and progressive men could actually be considered feminists. In the third installment, the men of the penal colony work together with Ripley to destroy the alien. As for the subsequent movies, it's better to just mentally erase them. The films also celebrate Native American art. Alien creator H.R. Giger was a great admirer of pre-Columbian art, and based the alien design partly on the stone reliefs of the Chav&iacute;n culture, a pre-Inca Andean society. One creature in Chav&iacute;n art is notably depicted with a mouth within its mouth. Considering these things adds layers of appreciation for the viewers. Ultimately, "Aliens" works because the filmmakers set out to make a good movie, rather than crank out a sequel simply to cash in on the success of its predecessor.

    'Aliens' came out in 1986, so the quality of it won't be as good as a movie coming out today. I'm not giving this movie any special treatment for that. I'm reviewing and rating it just like I would rate and review a movie that would come out now. Anyway, there are two types of people in the world: people who think 'Alien' is better than 'Aliens', and people who think 'Aliens' is better than 'Alien'. I don't think either of them is better than another. I watched the 1990 special addition of the movie, so it's two and a half hours long. 'Aliens' had a very slow first hour of the movie. It worked for only about twenty minutes. The movie then started dragging on for the other forty minutes. In the first twenty minutes, it was alright because the slowness hadn't gotten boring yet, it was just used to introduce new characters and go over the situation at hand. This part of the first hour was enjoyable. As it went on, though, we had already known all of the characters and there was just nothing going on. There was quite a bit of CGI used near the end of the first hour, which I think they could gone without using, because it was two-dimensional CGI. There were also green screens used, which also brought it down. That was part of the reason the forty minute boring part was bad. The other part of the reason is that it was simply unexciting. The acting in this movie had a few problems, too. A few of the actors didn't seem to give it their all. Luckily, the main actors and actresses (Sigourney Weaver, Carrie Henn, and Michael Biehn) did well. I believed those three actors and actresses were their characters. The supposed cast weren't all very good, though. In several scenes of this movie, the characters would have to be quiet to get through places, and there was no music in these parts. This made suspense build up to set up for action sequences. They executed this well in the film. It made trauma for the audience and even some intensity. That worked in the movie. They also didn't just have mindless acting in the movie. Every sequence had a reason for it's happening, which just made it more enjoyable. That brings up the quality of the acting sequences. The acting sequences were great. They had alright music for the situations and had very thrilling humans vs. aliens battle scenes. There were used of guns which brought more explosions that just made it more thrilling. Also, the humans didn't just win every time. There was an equal balance of aliens winning, too. This made the movie more thrilling and intense. It wouldn't have been good if the humans won every time. The technology used in that time period wasn't too far- fetched, either. Overall, this movie was really good. That's what my 8/10 rating means. I very much recommend 'Alien' and 'Aliens' to anyone who is thinking about watching it. I own the movie on Blu-Ray.
