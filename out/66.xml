    Over the year there's been no shortage of romantic comedies. Occasionally one comes along that stands out, as this one did, as evidenced by its tremendous box office appeal. I had never noticed Sandra Bullock until the film she made just before this one -- "Speed". Not my type of film, really. Then she followed up with this film, and she suddenly was pretty high on my list of favorite actresses. This film is utterly charming, without being sweet. Bullock brings an innocence and sense of being lost to the screen without one feeling sorry for her. Then, through a series of misunderstandings, people begin believing she is the fianc&eacute;e of a man in a coma...a man she has long had a secret crush on. Will they get married? It seems like the film is heading in that direction until she falls in real love with the brother of the man in the coma. One of the most special things about this film in the sense of family, even though the family is a bit odd. Bullock is tremendous here, and this may be her best film. Peter Gallagher has a key role here as the man in the coma, yet his role is not a strong one. Bill Pullman, not a favorite of mine, actually has a very good role here, and does exceptionally well with it. Micole Mercurio as the mother of the two men is very good, as is Peter Boyle -- another actor who was never high on my list. Glynis Johns is a hoot, though again, she's not one of my favorites. And perhaps the best supporting role in the film goes to Jack Warden -- a godfather and friend of the family, who becomes Bullock's friend, as well. If you like romantic comedies, you'll probably love this film. Highly recommended, with little to criticize.

    You should never judge a movie by it's title. This is exactly the case with While Your Were Sleeping. Despite the rather awful title, While Your Were Sleeping is a surprisingly charming movie. Lucy has no family. Few friends. And virtually nothing to look forward to in life except that cute guy (named Peter) who always comes down to the train station, where Lucy works, and buys a ticket for the train, every day. Then one day, Lucy sees Peter mugged and beaten and thrown onto the train tracks. Lucy ends up saving his life, but through a massive miscommunication, Peter's family thinks that Lucy is Peter's fianc&eacute;e. But instead of explaining things to Peter's family, she begins to enjoy having a family. But things only get more complex as time passes. While You Were Sleeping is incredibly cheesy, that much is undeniable. But under the hammy premise (that only gets worse as the film goes on), While You Were Sleeping is lots of fun. While You Were Sleeping plays out like a long I Love Lucy episode. The filmmakers must have realized this too, as the main character is named Lucy, and there's a brief reference to Ricky Ricardo. Amusing twists (some more predictable than others) are inserted to keep filmgoers on their toes. The result is often hilarious. The best bits of the film are when the whole family is together talking. They're often rambling about random topics until the end of the conversation that may leave you thinking, "What brought that up?" To make it more amusing, each family member is having a completely different conversation with another. I have trouble describing these parts, it's something you'd have to see for yourself. While You Were Sleeping is very well acted. While there's nothing award-deserving here, the acting feels natural. The characters are memorable, and often funny. Sandra Bullock plays perfectly as a desperate young girl, and Bill Pullman is convincing as a secondary love interest. The score (composed by Randy Edelman), while sometimes fun (especially during moments of chaos), the score sounds incredibly dated. The music isn't bad, but the dated themes are a little less pleasant than the rest of the score. While You Were Sleeping manages to overcome it's cheesy premise and clich&eacute;s. A committed cast and humorous situations makes While You Were Sleeping a fun, if predictable film.

    Sandra Bullock - someone that only a Hollywood producer would envision as a lonely spinster who can't get a man - is a Chicago el train ticket booth attendant with a secret crush on commuter Peter Gallagher. When he suffers a coma after falling onto the tracks, she goes to with him to the hospital, and through a wacky misunderstanding, his family believes that she is his fianc&eacute; that he never told them about. While he is in the coma, she gets to know them, and eventually falls for his brother, played by Bill Pullman. Like Sleepless in Seattle, this is another romantic comedy where the writers and directors confused plucky and adorable with stalkerish and insane. The plot sounds like a bunny-boiler sex thriller (even the title, While You Were Sleeping, is creepy) and yet, this is a fluffy chick flick. My girlfriend, who likes this movie has admitted that the fundamental wrongness that permeates the picture is the reason for her enjoyment of this mid-90's favorite, but I was less enamored. I would have actually preferred to have seen "While You Were Sleeping With Michael Douglas" (thanks, Kim Morgan) than this movie, which is uncomfortable in a not-fun way.

    Sandra Bullock, Bill Pullman and Peter Gallagher star in this 1995 romantic comedy. A woman unwittingly pretends to be engaged to a man who ends up in a coma. Lucy (Bullock) is a train token collector who longs for romance. One day, she saves a man, Peter (Gallagher) who ends up in a coma. At the hospital, a nurse mistakenly hears Lucy say she was going to marry him. Soon, Lucy meets Peter's family and brother, Jack. She and Jack start falling for each other and Lucy tries to tell the family the truth, but can't. When Peter wakes up, he can't remember anything and meets Lucy learning she's his fianc&eacute;e. Lucy tries to go through with the wedding, but reveals the truth to the family and soon ends up with Jack. The late greats, Peter Boyle and Jack Warden co-star in this as Ox and Saul. This is a good film and I think it's one of Sandra's best. She and Bill have great chemistry and I recommend this.

    Thanks Daffy for this (nearly) quote from one of your best cartoon ("You were duckier"), because it resumes well this movie: how after rescuing a man, Sandra is drowned under a flood of misunderstandings and little lyings that lead her to marry him, and all that while he is sleeping in coma! I thought that this movie would be a disaster because the cover looks cheap and on the contrary, it's as good as a Christmas gift: it has everything i like: Winter holidays, Chicago (more and more present in my movies and really a great town behind NYC and well ahead of LA), cats, a funny brunette, the in-law relationships and the pain from loneliness. The writers found a very original and funny idea and manage to sustain the drama and the comedy without stop. Unfortunately, they don't write anything else after. Maybe they fall also in coma and get married ?

    This is the first review i've ever done on this site but after reading some of the comments I would like to add mine too. There was nothing worth watching on the box this evening so I dug out my copy of WYWS and settled down on the sofa. Although I know this film pretty well having watched it a few times it never fails to give me a wonderful warm glow. Although Peter is a handsome guy the chemistry between Lucy and Jack is, without doubt, very real and the two characters play their roles brilliantly. There are so many quirky one liners in this film and the family scenes are well scripted and well acted. How I wish I could be "adopted" by a family like that even if it were only for the holiday season. If you're an old romantic like me (and hey i'm not that old lol) give this a try. I've given it a 10 because there isn't anything to dislike.

    I remember a few years ago,my dad telling me that he was going to trade in ,what looked to be a romantic comedy the was in a very mucky big-box Ex-Rental case.Partly due to how nasty the case looked,I said to him the that was fine. Jumping a few years forward... And,I am searching on Amazon for fun looking romantic comedies,that are being sold cheaply on DVD.When I got to the end of one of the many pages,I suddenly spotted this film among them all.I felt,that,since I had missed seeing it on my first chance to,plus the fact that it had two very good lead actors,and a pretty good director,the it was worth giving the film a shot. The plot: A long-time working subway worker called Lucy,has a crush on a very pleasant-looking commuter (Peter),though she is sadly unable to get the confidence to go and chat to him.One day,whilst he is waiting for his train to arrive,he gets mugged on the platform by a gang,who push him on to the rail line.Luckaly for Peter,Lucy is working there and she is able to bravely get him off the railway track alive.When Peter is taken to hospital,it is revealed to Lucy that Peter is now in a coma.When his family arrive,they are all understandable,very upset,but are all really hopeful that he will come out of the coma.With Lucy having been extremely sad since taking Peter to the hospital.The family ask that,due to how sad she has been,if she is engaged to him!!.With wanting to give the family something that can hopeful make them smile for a little bit,she decides to say that she is engaged to him.Thought as she gets to know the family more,Lucy stars developing feelings for Peters very sweet brother,Jack.Sadly for Lucy,questions are about to be asked,when Peter wakes up from his coma... View on the film: The main thing that I feel made the film a lot more enjoyable than I was thinking it would be,were the great performances from Sandra Bullock,and,the very under-rated Bill Pullman.Each of the actors make their friendship/relationship feel very charming and they have some very natural chemistry in all the scenes that they are in.When looking at the supporting cast,it has to be said that the people the play Peter and Jacks family,give the film a huge warming hearts,that even warms up the very chilly Chicargo,that director Joe Turteltaub has,smartly chosen for the look of the film.Writers Daniel G.Sullivan and Fredrick Lebow wisely decide to not make the story into a grim TV-Movie-of-the-week,but instead,to give it a very Innocent feel.The only downside with the screenplay,is that the ending is just a little bit too rushed,which makes the last 15 minutes of the film feel like it is trying to fit into Cindellas slipper. Final view on the film: A very engaging romantic comedy,with a well-written screenplay and charming performances from the whole cast.

    I have often wondered why Bill Pullman didn't become a bigger star than he is. He's played the romantic interest in a few films, starring opposite two of the romcom queens  Meg Ryan and Sandra Bullock. He was even great in Independence Day. And he is great in this film too, with enough charm and likability for viewers to understand why it is Lucy falls in love with his character. Sandra Bullock does well in her role, too. It's not an outstanding performance, but as an actress and person she is so likable that really all that matters is that she's cute and easy to watch on screen. Recommended for anyone who enjoys romantic comedies.

    Absolutely loved this movie. Have always been a fan of Sandra Bullock and went out and bought this film with relatively low expectations. I was watching it thinking, "this is the best fun i've had watching a movie in a long long time". All throughout I could not wipe the giant grin on my face, I found it very very funny at points and as I say again, one of the best feel good films i've seen in a long long time. Very well acted by all that were involved, especially Sandra Bullock and Bill Pullman. At the ending of the film i almost shed a tear with happiness. I would recommend this film to anyone who is feeling down in the dumps as it is a perfect pick me up and can be watched over and over and over again.

    I have often wondered why Bill Pullman didn't become a bigger star than he is. He's played the romantic interest in a few films, starring opposite two of the romcom queens  Meg Ryan and Sandra Bullock. He was even great in Independence Day. And he is great in this film too, with enough charm and likability for viewers to understand why it is Lucy falls in love with his character. Sandra Bullock does well in her role, too. It's not an outstanding performance, but as an actress and person she is so likable that really all that matters is that she's cute and easy to watch on screen. Recommended for anyone who enjoys romantic comedies.

    Absolutely loved this movie. Have always been a fan of Sandra Bullock and went out and bought this film with relatively low expectations. I was watching it thinking, "this is the best fun i've had watching a movie in a long long time". All throughout I could not wipe the giant grin on my face, I found it very very funny at points and as I say again, one of the best feel good films i've seen in a long long time. Very well acted by all that were involved, especially Sandra Bullock and Bill Pullman. At the ending of the film i almost shed a tear with happiness. I would recommend this film to anyone who is feeling down in the dumps as it is a perfect pick me up and can be watched over and over and over again.

    Over the year there's been no shortage of romantic comedies. Occasionally one comes along that stands out, as this one did, as evidenced by its tremendous box office appeal. I had never noticed Sandra Bullock until the film she made just before this one -- "Speed". Not my type of film, really. Then she followed up with this film, and she suddenly was pretty high on my list of favorite actresses. This film is utterly charming, without being sweet. Bullock brings an innocence and sense of being lost to the screen without one feeling sorry for her. Then, through a series of misunderstandings, people begin believing she is the fianc&eacute;e of a man in a coma...a man she has long had a secret crush on. Will they get married? It seems like the film is heading in that direction until she falls in real love with the brother of the man in the coma. One of the most special things about this film in the sense of family, even though the family is a bit odd. Bullock is tremendous here, and this may be her best film. Peter Gallagher has a key role here as the man in the coma, yet his role is not a strong one. Bill Pullman, not a favorite of mine, actually has a very good role here, and does exceptionally well with it. Micole Mercurio as the mother of the two men is very good, as is Peter Boyle -- another actor who was never high on my list. Glynis Johns is a hoot, though again, she's not one of my favorites. And perhaps the best supporting role in the film goes to Jack Warden -- a godfather and friend of the family, who becomes Bullock's friend, as well. If you like romantic comedies, you'll probably love this film. Highly recommended, with little to criticize.

    You should never judge a movie by it's title. This is exactly the case with While Your Were Sleeping. Despite the rather awful title, While Your Were Sleeping is a surprisingly charming movie. Lucy has no family. Few friends. And virtually nothing to look forward to in life except that cute guy (named Peter) who always comes down to the train station, where Lucy works, and buys a ticket for the train, every day. Then one day, Lucy sees Peter mugged and beaten and thrown onto the train tracks. Lucy ends up saving his life, but through a massive miscommunication, Peter's family thinks that Lucy is Peter's fianc&eacute;e. But instead of explaining things to Peter's family, she begins to enjoy having a family. But things only get more complex as time passes. While You Were Sleeping is incredibly cheesy, that much is undeniable. But under the hammy premise (that only gets worse as the film goes on), While You Were Sleeping is lots of fun. While You Were Sleeping plays out like a long I Love Lucy episode. The filmmakers must have realized this too, as the main character is named Lucy, and there's a brief reference to Ricky Ricardo. Amusing twists (some more predictable than others) are inserted to keep filmgoers on their toes. The result is often hilarious. The best bits of the film are when the whole family is together talking. They're often rambling about random topics until the end of the conversation that may leave you thinking, "What brought that up?" To make it more amusing, each family member is having a completely different conversation with another. I have trouble describing these parts, it's something you'd have to see for yourself. While You Were Sleeping is very well acted. While there's nothing award-deserving here, the acting feels natural. The characters are memorable, and often funny. Sandra Bullock plays perfectly as a desperate young girl, and Bill Pullman is convincing as a secondary love interest. The score (composed by Randy Edelman), while sometimes fun (especially during moments of chaos), the score sounds incredibly dated. The music isn't bad, but the dated themes are a little less pleasant than the rest of the score. While You Were Sleeping manages to overcome it's cheesy premise and clich&eacute;s. A committed cast and humorous situations makes While You Were Sleeping a fun, if predictable film.

    Sandra Bullock - someone that only a Hollywood producer would envision as a lonely spinster who can't get a man - is a Chicago el train ticket booth attendant with a secret crush on commuter Peter Gallagher. When he suffers a coma after falling onto the tracks, she goes to with him to the hospital, and through a wacky misunderstanding, his family believes that she is his fianc&eacute; that he never told them about. While he is in the coma, she gets to know them, and eventually falls for his brother, played by Bill Pullman. Like Sleepless in Seattle, this is another romantic comedy where the writers and directors confused plucky and adorable with stalkerish and insane. The plot sounds like a bunny-boiler sex thriller (even the title, While You Were Sleeping, is creepy) and yet, this is a fluffy chick flick. My girlfriend, who likes this movie has admitted that the fundamental wrongness that permeates the picture is the reason for her enjoyment of this mid-90's favorite, but I was less enamored. I would have actually preferred to have seen "While You Were Sleeping With Michael Douglas" (thanks, Kim Morgan) than this movie, which is uncomfortable in a not-fun way.

    Sandra Bullock, Bill Pullman and Peter Gallagher star in this 1995 romantic comedy. A woman unwittingly pretends to be engaged to a man who ends up in a coma. Lucy (Bullock) is a train token collector who longs for romance. One day, she saves a man, Peter (Gallagher) who ends up in a coma. At the hospital, a nurse mistakenly hears Lucy say she was going to marry him. Soon, Lucy meets Peter's family and brother, Jack. She and Jack start falling for each other and Lucy tries to tell the family the truth, but can't. When Peter wakes up, he can't remember anything and meets Lucy learning she's his fianc&eacute;e. Lucy tries to go through with the wedding, but reveals the truth to the family and soon ends up with Jack. The late greats, Peter Boyle and Jack Warden co-star in this as Ox and Saul. This is a good film and I think it's one of Sandra's best. She and Bill have great chemistry and I recommend this.

    Thanks Daffy for this (nearly) quote from one of your best cartoon ("You were duckier"), because it resumes well this movie: how after rescuing a man, Sandra is drowned under a flood of misunderstandings and little lyings that lead her to marry him, and all that while he is sleeping in coma! I thought that this movie would be a disaster because the cover looks cheap and on the contrary, it's as good as a Christmas gift: it has everything i like: Winter holidays, Chicago (more and more present in my movies and really a great town behind NYC and well ahead of LA), cats, a funny brunette, the in-law relationships and the pain from loneliness. The writers found a very original and funny idea and manage to sustain the drama and the comedy without stop. Unfortunately, they don't write anything else after. Maybe they fall also in coma and get married ?

    This is the first review i've ever done on this site but after reading some of the comments I would like to add mine too. There was nothing worth watching on the box this evening so I dug out my copy of WYWS and settled down on the sofa. Although I know this film pretty well having watched it a few times it never fails to give me a wonderful warm glow. Although Peter is a handsome guy the chemistry between Lucy and Jack is, without doubt, very real and the two characters play their roles brilliantly. There are so many quirky one liners in this film and the family scenes are well scripted and well acted. How I wish I could be "adopted" by a family like that even if it were only for the holiday season. If you're an old romantic like me (and hey i'm not that old lol) give this a try. I've given it a 10 because there isn't anything to dislike.

    I remember a few years ago,my dad telling me that he was going to trade in ,what looked to be a romantic comedy the was in a very mucky big-box Ex-Rental case.Partly due to how nasty the case looked,I said to him the that was fine. Jumping a few years forward... And,I am searching on Amazon for fun looking romantic comedies,that are being sold cheaply on DVD.When I got to the end of one of the many pages,I suddenly spotted this film among them all.I felt,that,since I had missed seeing it on my first chance to,plus the fact that it had two very good lead actors,and a pretty good director,the it was worth giving the film a shot. The plot: A long-time working subway worker called Lucy,has a crush on a very pleasant-looking commuter (Peter),though she is sadly unable to get the confidence to go and chat to him.One day,whilst he is waiting for his train to arrive,he gets mugged on the platform by a gang,who push him on to the rail line.Luckaly for Peter,Lucy is working there and she is able to bravely get him off the railway track alive.When Peter is taken to hospital,it is revealed to Lucy that Peter is now in a coma.When his family arrive,they are all understandable,very upset,but are all really hopeful that he will come out of the coma.With Lucy having been extremely sad since taking Peter to the hospital.The family ask that,due to how sad she has been,if she is engaged to him!!.With wanting to give the family something that can hopeful make them smile for a little bit,she decides to say that she is engaged to him.Thought as she gets to know the family more,Lucy stars developing feelings for Peters very sweet brother,Jack.Sadly for Lucy,questions are about to be asked,when Peter wakes up from his coma... View on the film: The main thing that I feel made the film a lot more enjoyable than I was thinking it would be,were the great performances from Sandra Bullock,and,the very under-rated Bill Pullman.Each of the actors make their friendship/relationship feel very charming and they have some very natural chemistry in all the scenes that they are in.When looking at the supporting cast,it has to be said that the people the play Peter and Jacks family,give the film a huge warming hearts,that even warms up the very chilly Chicargo,that director Joe Turteltaub has,smartly chosen for the look of the film.Writers Daniel G.Sullivan and Fredrick Lebow wisely decide to not make the story into a grim TV-Movie-of-the-week,but instead,to give it a very Innocent feel.The only downside with the screenplay,is that the ending is just a little bit too rushed,which makes the last 15 minutes of the film feel like it is trying to fit into Cindellas slipper. Final view on the film: A very engaging romantic comedy,with a well-written screenplay and charming performances from the whole cast.

    I have often wondered why Bill Pullman didn't become a bigger star than he is. He's played the romantic interest in a few films, starring opposite two of the romcom queens  Meg Ryan and Sandra Bullock. He was even great in Independence Day. And he is great in this film too, with enough charm and likability for viewers to understand why it is Lucy falls in love with his character. Sandra Bullock does well in her role, too. It's not an outstanding performance, but as an actress and person she is so likable that really all that matters is that she's cute and easy to watch on screen. Recommended for anyone who enjoys romantic comedies.

    Absolutely loved this movie. Have always been a fan of Sandra Bullock and went out and bought this film with relatively low expectations. I was watching it thinking, "this is the best fun i've had watching a movie in a long long time". All throughout I could not wipe the giant grin on my face, I found it very very funny at points and as I say again, one of the best feel good films i've seen in a long long time. Very well acted by all that were involved, especially Sandra Bullock and Bill Pullman. At the ending of the film i almost shed a tear with happiness. I would recommend this film to anyone who is feeling down in the dumps as it is a perfect pick me up and can be watched over and over and over again.

    Over the year there's been no shortage of romantic comedies. Occasionally one comes along that stands out, as this one did, as evidenced by its tremendous box office appeal. I had never noticed Sandra Bullock until the film she made just before this one -- "Speed". Not my type of film, really. Then she followed up with this film, and she suddenly was pretty high on my list of favorite actresses. This film is utterly charming, without being sweet. Bullock brings an innocence and sense of being lost to the screen without one feeling sorry for her. Then, through a series of misunderstandings, people begin believing she is the fianc&eacute;e of a man in a coma...a man she has long had a secret crush on. Will they get married? It seems like the film is heading in that direction until she falls in real love with the brother of the man in the coma. One of the most special things about this film in the sense of family, even though the family is a bit odd. Bullock is tremendous here, and this may be her best film. Peter Gallagher has a key role here as the man in the coma, yet his role is not a strong one. Bill Pullman, not a favorite of mine, actually has a very good role here, and does exceptionally well with it. Micole Mercurio as the mother of the two men is very good, as is Peter Boyle -- another actor who was never high on my list. Glynis Johns is a hoot, though again, she's not one of my favorites. And perhaps the best supporting role in the film goes to Jack Warden -- a godfather and friend of the family, who becomes Bullock's friend, as well. If you like romantic comedies, you'll probably love this film. Highly recommended, with little to criticize.

    You should never judge a movie by it's title. This is exactly the case with While Your Were Sleeping. Despite the rather awful title, While Your Were Sleeping is a surprisingly charming movie. Lucy has no family. Few friends. And virtually nothing to look forward to in life except that cute guy (named Peter) who always comes down to the train station, where Lucy works, and buys a ticket for the train, every day. Then one day, Lucy sees Peter mugged and beaten and thrown onto the train tracks. Lucy ends up saving his life, but through a massive miscommunication, Peter's family thinks that Lucy is Peter's fianc&eacute;e. But instead of explaining things to Peter's family, she begins to enjoy having a family. But things only get more complex as time passes. While You Were Sleeping is incredibly cheesy, that much is undeniable. But under the hammy premise (that only gets worse as the film goes on), While You Were Sleeping is lots of fun. While You Were Sleeping plays out like a long I Love Lucy episode. The filmmakers must have realized this too, as the main character is named Lucy, and there's a brief reference to Ricky Ricardo. Amusing twists (some more predictable than others) are inserted to keep filmgoers on their toes. The result is often hilarious. The best bits of the film are when the whole family is together talking. They're often rambling about random topics until the end of the conversation that may leave you thinking, "What brought that up?" To make it more amusing, each family member is having a completely different conversation with another. I have trouble describing these parts, it's something you'd have to see for yourself. While You Were Sleeping is very well acted. While there's nothing award-deserving here, the acting feels natural. The characters are memorable, and often funny. Sandra Bullock plays perfectly as a desperate young girl, and Bill Pullman is convincing as a secondary love interest. The score (composed by Randy Edelman), while sometimes fun (especially during moments of chaos), the score sounds incredibly dated. The music isn't bad, but the dated themes are a little less pleasant than the rest of the score. While You Were Sleeping manages to overcome it's cheesy premise and clich&eacute;s. A committed cast and humorous situations makes While You Were Sleeping a fun, if predictable film.

    Sandra Bullock - someone that only a Hollywood producer would envision as a lonely spinster who can't get a man - is a Chicago el train ticket booth attendant with a secret crush on commuter Peter Gallagher. When he suffers a coma after falling onto the tracks, she goes to with him to the hospital, and through a wacky misunderstanding, his family believes that she is his fianc&eacute; that he never told them about. While he is in the coma, she gets to know them, and eventually falls for his brother, played by Bill Pullman. Like Sleepless in Seattle, this is another romantic comedy where the writers and directors confused plucky and adorable with stalkerish and insane. The plot sounds like a bunny-boiler sex thriller (even the title, While You Were Sleeping, is creepy) and yet, this is a fluffy chick flick. My girlfriend, who likes this movie has admitted that the fundamental wrongness that permeates the picture is the reason for her enjoyment of this mid-90's favorite, but I was less enamored. I would have actually preferred to have seen "While You Were Sleeping With Michael Douglas" (thanks, Kim Morgan) than this movie, which is uncomfortable in a not-fun way.

    Sandra Bullock, Bill Pullman and Peter Gallagher star in this 1995 romantic comedy. A woman unwittingly pretends to be engaged to a man who ends up in a coma. Lucy (Bullock) is a train token collector who longs for romance. One day, she saves a man, Peter (Gallagher) who ends up in a coma. At the hospital, a nurse mistakenly hears Lucy say she was going to marry him. Soon, Lucy meets Peter's family and brother, Jack. She and Jack start falling for each other and Lucy tries to tell the family the truth, but can't. When Peter wakes up, he can't remember anything and meets Lucy learning she's his fianc&eacute;e. Lucy tries to go through with the wedding, but reveals the truth to the family and soon ends up with Jack. The late greats, Peter Boyle and Jack Warden co-star in this as Ox and Saul. This is a good film and I think it's one of Sandra's best. She and Bill have great chemistry and I recommend this.

    Thanks Daffy for this (nearly) quote from one of your best cartoon ("You were duckier"), because it resumes well this movie: how after rescuing a man, Sandra is drowned under a flood of misunderstandings and little lyings that lead her to marry him, and all that while he is sleeping in coma! I thought that this movie would be a disaster because the cover looks cheap and on the contrary, it's as good as a Christmas gift: it has everything i like: Winter holidays, Chicago (more and more present in my movies and really a great town behind NYC and well ahead of LA), cats, a funny brunette, the in-law relationships and the pain from loneliness. The writers found a very original and funny idea and manage to sustain the drama and the comedy without stop. Unfortunately, they don't write anything else after. Maybe they fall also in coma and get married ?

    This is the first review i've ever done on this site but after reading some of the comments I would like to add mine too. There was nothing worth watching on the box this evening so I dug out my copy of WYWS and settled down on the sofa. Although I know this film pretty well having watched it a few times it never fails to give me a wonderful warm glow. Although Peter is a handsome guy the chemistry between Lucy and Jack is, without doubt, very real and the two characters play their roles brilliantly. There are so many quirky one liners in this film and the family scenes are well scripted and well acted. How I wish I could be "adopted" by a family like that even if it were only for the holiday season. If you're an old romantic like me (and hey i'm not that old lol) give this a try. I've given it a 10 because there isn't anything to dislike.

    I remember a few years ago,my dad telling me that he was going to trade in ,what looked to be a romantic comedy the was in a very mucky big-box Ex-Rental case.Partly due to how nasty the case looked,I said to him the that was fine. Jumping a few years forward... And,I am searching on Amazon for fun looking romantic comedies,that are being sold cheaply on DVD.When I got to the end of one of the many pages,I suddenly spotted this film among them all.I felt,that,since I had missed seeing it on my first chance to,plus the fact that it had two very good lead actors,and a pretty good director,the it was worth giving the film a shot. The plot: A long-time working subway worker called Lucy,has a crush on a very pleasant-looking commuter (Peter),though she is sadly unable to get the confidence to go and chat to him.One day,whilst he is waiting for his train to arrive,he gets mugged on the platform by a gang,who push him on to the rail line.Luckaly for Peter,Lucy is working there and she is able to bravely get him off the railway track alive.When Peter is taken to hospital,it is revealed to Lucy that Peter is now in a coma.When his family arrive,they are all understandable,very upset,but are all really hopeful that he will come out of the coma.With Lucy having been extremely sad since taking Peter to the hospital.The family ask that,due to how sad she has been,if she is engaged to him!!.With wanting to give the family something that can hopeful make them smile for a little bit,she decides to say that she is engaged to him.Thought as she gets to know the family more,Lucy stars developing feelings for Peters very sweet brother,Jack.Sadly for Lucy,questions are about to be asked,when Peter wakes up from his coma... View on the film: The main thing that I feel made the film a lot more enjoyable than I was thinking it would be,were the great performances from Sandra Bullock,and,the very under-rated Bill Pullman.Each of the actors make their friendship/relationship feel very charming and they have some very natural chemistry in all the scenes that they are in.When looking at the supporting cast,it has to be said that the people the play Peter and Jacks family,give the film a huge warming hearts,that even warms up the very chilly Chicargo,that director Joe Turteltaub has,smartly chosen for the look of the film.Writers Daniel G.Sullivan and Fredrick Lebow wisely decide to not make the story into a grim TV-Movie-of-the-week,but instead,to give it a very Innocent feel.The only downside with the screenplay,is that the ending is just a little bit too rushed,which makes the last 15 minutes of the film feel like it is trying to fit into Cindellas slipper. Final view on the film: A very engaging romantic comedy,with a well-written screenplay and charming performances from the whole cast.

He's played the romantic interest in a few films, starring opposite two of the romcom queens  Meg Ryan and Sandra Bullock. He was even great in Independence Day. And he is great in this film too, with enough charm and likability for viewers to understand why it is Lucy falls in love with his character. Sandra Bullock does well in her role, too. It's not an outstanding performance, but as an actress and person she is so likable that really all that matters is that she's cute and easy to watch on screen. Recommended for anyone who enjoys romantic comedies.

    Absolutely loved this movie. Have always been a fan of Sandra Bullock and went out and bought this film with relatively low expectations. I was watching it thinking, "this is the best fun i've had watching a movie in a long long time". All throughout I could not wipe the giant grin on my face, I found it very very funny at points and as I say again, one of the best feel good films i've seen in a long long time. Very well acted by all that were involved, especially Sandra Bullock and Bill Pullman. At the ending of the film i almost shed a tear with happiness. I would recommend this film to anyone who is feeling down in the dumps as it is a perfect pick me up and can be watched over and over and over again.

    Over the year there's been no shortage of romantic comedies. Occasionally one comes along that stands out, as this one did, as evidenced by its tremendous box office appeal. I had never noticed Sandra Bullock until the film she made just before this one -- "Speed". Not my type of film, really. Then she followed up with this film, and she suddenly was pretty high on my list of favorite actresses. This film is utterly charming, without being sweet. Bullock brings an innocence and sense of being lost to the screen without one feeling sorry for her. Then, through a series of misunderstandings, people begin believing she is the fianc&eacute;e of a man in a coma...a man she has long had a secret crush on. Will they get married? It seems like the film is heading in that direction until she falls in real love with the brother of the man in the coma. One of the most special things about this film in the sense of family, even though the family is a bit odd. Bullock is tremendous here, and this may be her best film. Peter Gallagher has a key role here as the man in the coma, yet his role is not a strong one. Bill Pullman, not a favorite of mine, actually has a very good role here, and does exceptionally well with it. Micole Mercurio as the mother of the two men is very good, as is Peter Boyle -- another actor who was never high on my list. Glynis Johns is a hoot, though again, she's not one of my favorites. And perhaps the best supporting role in the film goes to Jack Warden -- a godfather and friend of the family, who becomes Bullock's friend, as well. If you like romantic comedies, you'll probably love this film. Highly recommended, with little to criticize.

    You should never judge a movie by it's title. This is exactly the case with While Your Were Sleeping. Despite the rather awful title, While Your Were Sleeping is a surprisingly charming movie. Lucy has no family. Few friends. And virtually nothing to look forward to in life except that cute guy (named Peter) who always comes down to the train station, where Lucy works, and buys a ticket for the train, every day. Then one day, Lucy sees Peter mugged and beaten and thrown onto the train tracks. Lucy ends up saving his life, but through a massive miscommunication, Peter's family thinks that Lucy is Peter's fianc&eacute;e. But instead of explaining things to Peter's family, she begins to enjoy having a family. But things only get more complex as time passes. While You Were Sleeping is incredibly cheesy, that much is undeniable. But under the hammy premise (that only gets worse as the film goes on), While You Were Sleeping is lots of fun. While You Were Sleeping plays out like a long I Love Lucy episode. The filmmakers must have realized this too, as the main character is named Lucy, and there's a brief reference to Ricky Ricardo. Amusing twists (some more predictable than others) are inserted to keep filmgoers on their toes. The result is often hilarious. The best bits of the film are when the whole family is together talking. They're often rambling about random topics until the end of the conversation that may leave you thinking, "What brought that up?" To make it more amusing, each family member is having a completely different conversation with another. I have trouble describing these parts, it's something you'd have to see for yourself. While You Were Sleeping is very well acted. While there's nothing award-deserving here, the acting feels natural. The characters are memorable, and often funny. Sandra Bullock plays perfectly as a desperate young girl, and Bill Pullman is convincing as a secondary love interest. The score (composed by Randy Edelman), while sometimes fun (especially during moments of chaos), the score sounds incredibly dated. The music isn't bad, but the dated themes are a little less pleasant than the rest of the score. While You Were Sleeping manages to overcome it's cheesy premise and clich&eacute;s. A committed cast and humorous situations makes While You Were Sleeping a fun, if predictable film.

    Sandra Bullock - someone that only a Hollywood producer would envision as a lonely spinster who can't get a man - is a Chicago el train ticket booth attendant with a secret crush on commuter Peter Gallagher. When he suffers a coma after falling onto the tracks, she goes to with him to the hospital, and through a wacky misunderstanding, his family believes that she is his fianc&eacute; that he never told them about. While he is in the coma, she gets to know them, and eventually falls for his brother, played by Bill Pullman. Like Sleepless in Seattle, this is another romantic comedy where the writers and directors confused plucky and adorable with stalkerish and insane. The plot sounds like a bunny-boiler sex thriller (even the title, While You Were Sleeping, is creepy) and yet, this is a fluffy chick flick. My girlfriend, who likes this movie has admitted that the fundamental wrongness that permeates the picture is the reason for her enjoyment of this mid-90's favorite, but I was less enamored. I would have actually preferred to have seen "While You Were Sleeping With Michael Douglas" (thanks, Kim Morgan) than this movie, which is uncomfortable in a not-fun way.

    Sandra Bullock, Bill Pullman and Peter Gallagher star in this 1995 romantic comedy. A woman unwittingly pretends to be engaged to a man who ends up in a coma. Lucy (Bullock) is a train token collector who longs for romance. One day, she saves a man, Peter (Gallagher) who ends up in a coma. At the hospital, a nurse mistakenly hears Lucy say she was going to marry him. Soon, Lucy meets Peter's family and brother, Jack. She and Jack start falling for each other and Lucy tries to tell the family the truth, but can't. When Peter wakes up, he can't remember anything and meets Lucy learning she's his fianc&eacute;e. Lucy tries to go through with the wedding, but reveals the truth to the family and soon ends up with Jack. The late greats, Peter Boyle and Jack Warden co-star in this as Ox and Saul. This is a good film and I think it's one of Sandra's best. She and Bill have great chemistry and I recommend this.

    Thanks Daffy for this (nearly) quote from one of your best cartoon ("You were duckier"), because it resumes well this movie: how after rescuing a man, Sandra is drowned under a flood of misunderstandings and little lyings that lead her to marry him, and all that while he is sleeping in coma! I thought that this movie would be a disaster because the cover looks cheap and on the contrary, it's as good as a Christmas gift: it has everything i like: Winter holidays, Chicago (more and more present in my movies and really a great town behind NYC and well ahead of LA), cats, a funny brunette, the in-law relationships and the pain from loneliness. The writers found a very original and funny idea and manage to sustain the drama and the comedy without stop. Unfortunately, they don't write anything else after. Maybe they fall also in coma and get married ?

    This is the first review i've ever done on this site but after reading some of the comments I would like to add mine too. There was nothing worth watching on the box this evening so I dug out my copy of WYWS and settled down on the sofa. Although I know this film pretty well having watched it a few times it never fails to give me a wonderful warm glow. Although Peter is a handsome guy the chemistry between Lucy and Jack is, without doubt, very real and the two characters play their roles brilliantly. There are so many quirky one liners in this film and the family scenes are well scripted and well acted. How I wish I could be "adopted" by a family like that even if it were only for the holiday season. If you're an old romantic like me (and hey i'm not that old lol) give this a try. I've given it a 10 because there isn't anything to dislike.

    I remember a few years ago,my dad telling me that he was going to trade in ,what looked to be a romantic comedy the was in a very mucky big-box Ex-Rental case.Partly due to how nasty the case looked,I said to him the that was fine. Jumping a few years forward... And,I am searching on Amazon for fun looking romantic comedies,that are being sold cheaply on DVD.When I got to the end of one of the many pages,I suddenly spotted this film among them all.I felt,that,since I had missed seeing it on my first chance to,plus the fact that it had two very good lead actors,and a pretty good director,the it was worth giving the film a shot. The plot: A long-time working subway worker called Lucy,has a crush on a very pleasant-looking commuter (Peter),though she is sadly unable to get the confidence to go and chat to him.One day,whilst he is waiting for his train to arrive,he gets mugged on the platform by a gang,who push him on to the rail line.Luckaly for Peter,Lucy is working there and she is able to bravely get him off the railway track alive.When Peter is taken to hospital,it is revealed to Lucy that Peter is now in a coma.When his family arrive,they are all understandable,very upset,but are all really hopeful that he will come out of the coma.With Lucy having been extremely sad since taking Peter to the hospital.The family ask that,due to how sad she has been,if she is engaged to him!!.With wanting to give the family something that can hopeful make them smile for a little bit,she decides to say that she is engaged to him.Thought as she gets to know the family more,Lucy stars developing feelings for Peters very sweet brother,Jack.Sadly for Lucy,questions are about to be asked,when Peter wakes up from his coma... View on the film: The main thing that I feel made the film a lot more enjoyable than I was thinking it would be,were the great performances from Sandra Bullock,and,the very under-rated Bill Pullman.Each of the actors make their friendship/relationship feel very charming and they have some very natural chemistry in all the scenes that they are in.When looking at the supporting cast,it has to be said that the people the play Peter and Jacks family,give the film a huge warming hearts,that even warms up the very chilly Chicargo,that director Joe Turteltaub has,smartly chosen for the look of the film.Writers Daniel G.Sullivan and Fredrick Lebow wisely decide to not make the story into a grim TV-Movie-of-the-week,but instead,to give it a very Innocent feel.The only downside with the screenplay,is that the ending is just a little bit too rushed,which makes the last 15 minutes of the film feel like it is trying to fit into Cindellas slipper. Final view on the film: A very engaging romantic comedy,with a well-written screenplay and charming performances from the whole cast.

And he is great in this film too, with enough charm and likability for viewers to understand why it is Lucy falls in love with his character. Sandra Bullock does well in her role, too. It's not an outstanding performance, but as an actress and person she is so likable that really all that matters is that she's cute and easy to watch on screen. Recommended for anyone who enjoys romantic comedies.

    Absolutely loved this movie. Have always been a fan of Sandra Bullock and went out and bought this film with relatively low expectations. I was watching it thinking, "this is the best fun i've had watching a movie in a long long time". All throughout I could not wipe the giant grin on my face, I found it very very funny at points and as I say again, one of the best feel good films i've seen in a long long time. Very well acted by all that were involved, especially Sandra Bullock and Bill Pullman. At the ending of the film i almost shed a tear with happiness. I would recommend this film to anyone who is feeling down in the dumps as it is a perfect pick me up and can be watched over and over and over again.

    Over the year there's been no shortage of romantic comedies. Occasionally one comes along that stands out, as this one did, as evidenced by its tremendous box office appeal. I had never noticed Sandra Bullock until the film she made just before this one -- "Speed". Not my type of film, really. Then she followed up with this film, and she suddenly was pretty high on my list of favorite actresses. This film is utterly charming, without being sweet. Bullock brings an innocence and sense of being lost to the screen without one feeling sorry for her. Then, through a series of misunderstandings, people begin believing she is the fianc&eacute;e of a man in a coma...a man she has long had a secret crush on. Will they get married? It seems like the film is heading in that direction until she falls in real love with the brother of the man in the coma. One of the most special things about this film in the sense of family, even though the family is a bit odd. Bullock is tremendous here, and this may be her best film. Peter Gallagher has a key role here as the man in the coma, yet his role is not a strong one. Bill Pullman, not a favorite of mine, actually has a very good role here, and does exceptionally well with it. Micole Mercurio as the mother of the two men is very good, as is Peter Boyle -- another actor who was never high on my list. Glynis Johns is a hoot, though again, she's not one of my favorites. And perhaps the best supporting role in the film goes to Jack Warden -- a godfather and friend of the family, who becomes Bullock's friend, as well. If you like romantic comedies, you'll probably love this film. Highly recommended, with little to criticize.

    You should never judge a movie by it's title. This is exactly the case with While Your Were Sleeping. Despite the rather awful title, While Your Were Sleeping is a surprisingly charming movie. Lucy has no family. Few friends. And virtually nothing to look forward to in life except that cute guy (named Peter) who always comes down to the train station, where Lucy works, and buys a ticket for the train, every day. Then one day, Lucy sees Peter mugged and beaten and thrown onto the train tracks. Lucy ends up saving his life, but through a massive miscommunication, Peter's family thinks that Lucy is Peter's fianc&eacute;e. But instead of explaining things to Peter's family, she begins to enjoy having a family. But things only get more complex as time passes. While You Were Sleeping is incredibly cheesy, that much is undeniable. But under the hammy premise (that only gets worse as the film goes on), While You Were Sleeping is lots of fun. While You Were Sleeping plays out like a long I Love Lucy episode. The filmmakers must have realized this too, as the main character is named Lucy, and there's a brief reference to Ricky Ricardo. Amusing twists (some more predictable than others) are inserted to keep filmgoers on their toes. The result is often hilarious. The best bits of the film are when the whole family is together talking. They're often rambling about random topics until the end of the conversation that may leave you thinking, "What brought that up?" To make it more amusing, each family member is having a completely different conversation with another. I have trouble describing these parts, it's something you'd have to see for yourself. While You Were Sleeping is very well acted. While there's nothing award-deserving here, the acting feels natural. The characters are memorable, and often funny. Sandra Bullock plays perfectly as a desperate young girl, and Bill Pullman is convincing as a secondary love interest. The score (composed by Randy Edelman), while sometimes fun (especially during moments of chaos), the score sounds incredibly dated. The music isn't bad, but the dated themes are a little less pleasant than the rest of the score. While You Were Sleeping manages to overcome it's cheesy premise and clich&eacute;s. A committed cast and humorous situations makes While You Were Sleeping a fun, if predictable film.

    Sandra Bullock - someone that only a Hollywood producer would envision as a lonely spinster who can't get a man - is a Chicago el train ticket booth attendant with a secret crush on commuter Peter Gallagher. When he suffers a coma after falling onto the tracks, she goes to with him to the hospital, and through a wacky misunderstanding, his family believes that she is his fianc&eacute; that he never told them about. While he is in the coma, she gets to know them, and eventually falls for his brother, played by Bill Pullman. Like Sleepless in Seattle, this is another romantic comedy where the writers and directors confused plucky and adorable with stalkerish and insane. The plot sounds like a bunny-boiler sex thriller (even the title, While You Were Sleeping, is creepy) and yet, this is a fluffy chick flick. My girlfriend, who likes this movie has admitted that the fundamental wrongness that permeates the picture is the reason for her enjoyment of this mid-90's favorite, but I was less enamored. I would have actually preferred to have seen "While You Were Sleeping With Michael Douglas" (thanks, Kim Morgan) than this movie, which is uncomfortable in a not-fun way.

    Sandra Bullock, Bill Pullman and Peter Gallagher star in this 1995 romantic comedy. A woman unwittingly pretends to be engaged to a man who ends up in a coma. Lucy (Bullock) is a train token collector who longs for romance. One day, she saves a man, Peter (Gallagher) who ends up in a coma. At the hospital, a nurse mistakenly hears Lucy say she was going to marry him. Soon, Lucy meets Peter's family and brother, Jack. She and Jack start falling for each other and Lucy tries to tell the family the truth, but can't. When Peter wakes up, he can't remember anything and meets Lucy learning she's his fianc&eacute;e. Lucy tries to go through with the wedding, but reveals the truth to the family and soon ends up with Jack. The late greats, Peter Boyle and Jack Warden co-star in this as Ox and Saul. This is a good film and I think it's one of Sandra's best. She and Bill have great chemistry and I recommend this.

    Thanks Daffy for this (nearly) quote from one of your best cartoon ("You were duckier"), because it resumes well this movie: how after rescuing a man, Sandra is drowned under a flood of misunderstandings and little lyings that lead her to marry him, and all that while he is sleeping in coma! I thought that this movie would be a disaster because the cover looks cheap and on the contrary, it's as good as a Christmas gift: it has everything i like: Winter holidays, Chicago (more and more present in my movies and really a great town behind NYC and well ahead of LA), cats, a funny brunette, the in-law relationships and the pain from loneliness. The writers found a very original and funny idea and manage to sustain the drama and the comedy without stop. Unfortunately, they don't write anything else after. Maybe they fall also in coma and get married ?

    This is the first review i've ever done on this site but after reading some of the comments I would like to add mine too. There was nothing worth watching on the box this evening so I dug out my copy of WYWS and settled down on the sofa. Although I know this film pretty well having watched it a few times it never fails to give me a wonderful warm glow. Although Peter is a handsome guy the chemistry between Lucy and Jack is, without doubt, very real and the two characters play their roles brilliantly. There are so many quirky one liners in this film and the family scenes are well scripted and well acted. How I wish I could be "adopted" by a family like that even if it were only for the holiday season. If you're an old romantic like me (and hey i'm not that old lol) give this a try. I've given it a 10 because there isn't anything to dislike.

    I remember a few years ago,my dad telling me that he was going to trade in ,what looked to be a romantic comedy the was in a very mucky big-box Ex-Rental case.Partly due to how nasty the case looked,I said to him the that was fine. Jumping a few years forward... And,I am searching on Amazon for fun looking romantic comedies,that are being sold cheaply on DVD.When I got to the end of one of the many pages,I suddenly spotted this film among them all.I felt,that,since I had missed seeing it on my first chance to,plus the fact that it had two very good lead actors,and a pretty good director,the it was worth giving the film a shot. The plot: A long-time working subway worker called Lucy,has a crush on a very pleasant-looking commuter (Peter),though she is sadly unable to get the confidence to go and chat to him.One day,whilst he is waiting for his train to arrive,he gets mugged on the platform by a gang,who push him on to the rail line.Luckaly for Peter,Lucy is working there and she is able to bravely get him off the railway track alive.When Peter is taken to hospital,it is revealed to Lucy that Peter is now in a coma.When his family arrive,they are all understandable,very upset,but are all really hopeful that he will come out of the coma.With Lucy having been extremely sad since taking Peter to the hospital.The family ask that,due to how sad she has been,if she is engaged to him!!.With wanting to give the family something that can hopeful make them smile for a little bit,she decides to say that she is engaged to him.Thought as she gets to know the family more,Lucy stars developing feelings for Peters very sweet brother,Jack.Sadly for Lucy,questions are about to be asked,when Peter wakes up from his coma... View on the film: The main thing that I feel made the film a lot more enjoyable than I was thinking it would be,were the great performances from Sandra Bullock,and,the very under-rated Bill Pullman.Each of the actors make their friendship/relationship feel very charming and they have some very natural chemistry in all the scenes that they are in.When looking at the supporting cast,it has to be said that the people the play Peter and Jacks family,give the film a huge warming hearts,that even warms up the very chilly Chicargo,that director Joe Turteltaub has,smartly chosen for the look of the film.Writers Daniel G.Sullivan and Fredrick Lebow wisely decide to not make the story into a grim TV-Movie-of-the-week,but instead,to give it a very Innocent feel.The only downside with the screenplay,is that the ending is just a little bit too rushed,which makes the last 15 minutes of the film feel like it is trying to fit into Cindellas slipper. Final view on the film: A very engaging romantic comedy,with a well-written screenplay and charming performances from the whole cast.

    I have often wondered why Bill Pullman didn't become a bigger star than he is. He's played the romantic interest in a few films, starring opposite two of the romcom queens  Meg Ryan and Sandra Bullock. He was even great in Independence Day. And he is great in this film too, with enough charm and likability for viewers to understand why it is Lucy falls in love with his character. Sandra Bullock does well in her role, too. It's not an outstanding performance, but as an actress and person she is so likable that really all that matters is that she's cute and easy to watch on screen. Recommended for anyone who enjoys romantic comedies.

    Absolutely loved this movie. Have always been a fan of Sandra Bullock and went out and bought this film with relatively low expectations. I was watching it thinking, "this is the best fun i've had watching a movie in a long long time". All throughout I could not wipe the giant grin on my face, I found it very very funny at points and as I say again, one of the best feel good films i've seen in a long long time. Very well acted by all that were involved, especially Sandra Bullock and Bill Pullman. At the ending of the film i almost shed a tear with happiness. I would recommend this film to anyone who is feeling down in the dumps as it is a perfect pick me up and can be watched over and over and over again.
