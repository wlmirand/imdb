 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Henry Hackett is the editor of a New York City tabloid. He is a workaholic who loves his job, but the long hours and low pay are leading to discontent. Also, publisher Bernie White faces financial straits, and has hatchetman Alicia Clark, Henry's nemesis, impose unpopular cutbacks. Henry's wife Martha, a hugely pregnant former reporter of his, is fed up because he has so little time for his family. He is therefore considering an offer from Paul Bladden to edit a paper like the New York Times, which would mean more money, shorter hours, more respectability...but might also be a bit boring for his tastes. But a hot story soon confronts Henry with tough decisions.

    The Paper is one of those movies I revisit every once in awhile, after having seen it multiple of times when I was younger. And with visit, I fall in love with it all over again. What's funny, with this 8/7/13 latest viewing, is that they knew their kind, back in 1994, was on their way out. Talk about foreshadowing! Now, the newspaper business isn't extinct yet, but probably will be soon. I know I haven't subscribed to a newspaper in probably 15-16 years, but I did love reading them  despite the black fingers and stacks of old papers to be taken out as downfalls. I digress. My point is, if anyone watches this today, for the first time, they may find it completely outdated. Case in point: (chain) smoking in buildings, beepers and least of all: the newspaper business trying to be the first to nab a story when it only publishes once a day and at night. This is sad. This movie is literally action and suspense-packed from minute one. I enjoy the progression of these characters, their deadlines, stress, movements, dialogue and depth. I believe this movie is incredibly made well, fun, funny and is worth every minute of screen time. So, if you're a first time viewer, just think: 1994 and move on and along with these fantastic characters. I also fancy 24-hour movies, or films that take place in one day'ish. This one begins in the morning, and follows reporter/editor Henry (a fantastic performance from Michael Keaton) for one complete day and his plight to tell the truth vs. what's easy to publish that might ruin two boy's lives. They're accused of murder and this particular newspaper's front page (alone) might convict them. He needs to fight deadlines, problems, his own superiors and the pending birth of his first child. You feel every bit of his stress and love it at the same time. Every single actor in this movie gave their 100% and had incredible depth and believability. But, namely, I loved Keaton's Henry, Glenn Close's Alicia, Robert Duvall's Bernie and Randy Quaid's Michael. Notably, and as a TV's The Incredible Hulk fan growing up, it's awesome to see the name "Jack McGee" show up in the credits. (He's a minor character, but that namein association with a movie about an all-but tabloidis gold for a fan of the Hulk series like me.) I don't award too many films with 5/5 stars (or in IMDb's case, 10/10,) but besides the fact I grew up wanting to be a journalist (and studied it in college many moons ago,) I fall more and more in love with this film as the day progresses with each viewing. I love the story, the fast pace, the cinematography, the comedic lines and above all else, the characters. I absolutely love this film. On a side note, it's sad to say, in 1994, and in 2013racial tensions and crimes almost match. This makes this movie relevant, even today, but not for good reasons.

    "The Paper"'s strong suit is its second act, when it's actually being a newspaper movie. Sure, the whole movies set in the offices of a second- rate New York City paper, but most of what goes on in those offices is human drama ... and actually kinda soap opera-ey, at that. Keaton's torn between a better job elsewhere and doing what he's hard-wired to do. It's like "His Girl Friday", but there's no tension or interplay between his character and whomever would substitute Cary Grant, here. And although Keaton is the shining star, there are some good performances from the ensemble cast: Glenn Close, Robert Duvall, Marisa Tomei, and even Randy Quaid). And I did like the uses of wry humor to add levity to the darker scenes. Still not a fan of the blood in the kitchen scene; felt contrived and didn't really go anywhere (did Keaton learn anything from it? Will things change?). Decent movie; at its best when it focuses on the wrongfully-convicted teens story. 6/10

    Beginning with Five Star Final in the early thirties the Talkies have been punctuated with movies about the fourth estate, Bogie did one as did Jack Webb and here is yet another with a not-quite A-list cast but none the worse for that. Essentially it's 24 hours on Grub Street with the likes of Marisa Tomei, Glenn Close, Randy Quaid, Michael Keaton and Jason Robards combining to turn out a Bulldog edition of stylish entertainment. The several plot strands come together when necessary and are otherwise kept apart with the whole offering a satisfying glimpse of life in tabloid land. With luck it should stand up to another viewing via DVD.

    This movie came out right ahead of the surge of DVDs and the phasing out of VHS. It also was a couple of years before I retired, and we weren't watching many movies then. So we missed this one. Finally, today we saw it, very enjoyable with some of our favorite actors. Michael Keaton is Henry Hackett, news editor for a fictitious 2nd-tier newspaper in New York. He is somewhat of a workaholic, to the dismay of his pregnant wife who seldom sees him arrive on time for anything. Now she fears she will be virtually alone to raise their child. Marisa Tomei is his wife, Martha Hackett, in this role right near the same time she won an Oscar for her role in "My Cousin Vinney." She was in her 20s, while Keaton was already in his early 40s. But they make a good match in this newspaper movie. There are several themes, one being Henry's opportunity to leave for a better-paying job with a larger New York paper. Also his feud with the managing editor, the "bean counter" worried about cost, Glenn Close as Alicia Clark. But the core newspaper story involves two men being gunned down in their car, and two young black students being seen near the car. They didn't do it, but were arrested and Henry wants to get to the bottom of the real story, while Alicia wants to get the paper out on deadline. After all the union drivers are waiting, and it costs $12,000 for every half hour they delay! Always reliable Robert Duvall is Bernie White the publisher, fighting his own battles, prostate cancer and an estranged daughter. All in all a good movie.

    Ron Howard is a legendary filmmaker, no two options on that! His body of work is truly admirable, as he has made dozens of memorable films. 'The Paper' is another feather in his well-decorated cap, a film that exposes the behind-the-scenes of a newsroom. It beautifully depicts 24 hours in a newspaper editor's professional and personal life. Howard makes the most believable characters in a subject like this. Each character has a interesting story to tell, which is the U.S.P of this rush-hour flick. As mentioned, It offers Super Entertainment in those 110 minutes. Howard's direction, as always, deserves brownie points. David & Stephen Koepp's screenplay is super, with memorable dialog. John Seale's Cinematography is perfect. Daniel P. Hanley & Mike Hill's editing is flawless. In the acting department, Glenn Close is fantastic. She plays her character flawlessly. Michael Keaton is lovable. One of my all-time favorite actors! Robert Duvall, like always, is restrained and cool. Marisa Tomei is excellent. Randy Quaid is funny, and gets it right. Jason Robards in a cameo, is fine. On the whole, 'The Paper' is a memorable film. An Ideal Sunday Afernoon Watch! Thumbs Up!

    There are not too many solid Newspaper stories which ever make it to the silver Screen. Occasionally one does comes along and if it's message is important with respect towards the audience, it deserves attention. Such a movie is, " The Paper ". The star of the movie is Michael Keaton who plays Henry Hackett a city editor who's boss is Bernie White played by noted actor Robert Duvall. Jason Robards is the Publisher, Graham Keighley. Their newspaper is about to print a story about a local derailment, when a small item arrest in Williamsburg NY, inspires Hackett to risk his position and a promotion with 'The Sentinal'' a prestigious uptown Newspaper. There are a number of hurtles to following up on the Williamsburg murder of three prominent bankers who lost several million dollars of the Mafia's money, primary of which is Alicia Clark (Glenn Close) an envious supervisor who is more interested in saving money than the reputations of two black youths. She explains that without more information on the dead men, additional corroboration or a quote by the tight-lipped police, she is running the subway derailment story. Confident he is right, Hackett pulls out all the stops to beat a four hour deadline, attend his wife's (Marisa Tomei) social life, protect his top reporter (Randy Quaid) from a gun-toting parking official (Jason Alexander) and file the story by press time. The movie possess all the exciting impetus of a modern front page story including the daily problems confronting the staff and the personal lives of all concern. The film is powerful in it's direction and will in time be seen as a Journalistic Classic. Easilly recommended for all. ****

    I loved this movie...a real 90s sleeper. It's hard to determine why some films don't get the attention they deserve. The Paper is delightfully acted by an A-list ensemble in their prime. It's hilariously funny, with great timing and pace, and some poignant overtones on commitment, loyalty, family, friendship, work and the workplace, and big city journalism. Feel-good and sardonic at the same time, I did NOT find it completely predictable. The screenplay is terrific, with thoughtful, intelligent, brisk dialog. Not a dull moment; completely entertaining. A film for "grown-ups". More kudos to Ron Howard. Renting it just to watch the superb Glen Close's character, especially in the "stop the presses" scene, is worth the time/money alone. A charming Marisa Tomei perfectly cast. Robert Duvall, Jason Alexander, Jason Robards, and of course Michael Keaton...what's not to like? One of those films that can be watched many times by men and women alike. Highly recommended.

    'The Paper' is solid entertainment. The film shows the high tension jobs of reporters working in a big city tabloid paper. The plot is rather implausible, but the film has a cracking pace and good performances all round. Michael Keaton is dynamite as the workaholic editor of the paper who's immersed in his job and neglecting his pregnant wife Marisa Tomei. Robert Duvall, Glenn Close and Jason Robards all do well in supporting roles. The ending is full of loop-holes but somehow manages to work. Worth watching for it's energy and fine acting. Overall 7/10

    I've been to a newsroom only twice in my life. First, it's to collect some lucky draw winnings, and I had a sneak peek into the hustle and bustle of a newsroom from behind a glass panel. The next one was more up close and personal, because a journalist friend brought me right up to his desk (and an incredibly piled up one at that), and I had first hand view of how news got made. Or at least it seemed that the next day's articles were done up because there were few people left in the office, and there was a group huddled at one corner. Ron Howard's The Paper was one of those films that I didn't catch at the cinemas (at that time, the teenage me only recognized Michael Keaton of his 1989 Batman and 1992 Batman Returns fame), and missed a number of scheduled telecast and re-runs on television. So it's no surprise that I snapped up the DVD the minute I saw it in the discount bins at the store. And I wonder just why the heck it took me so long to get down to watching this, with no regrets (save for the technical aspect of the presentation). Keaton plays a Henry Hackett, a sub-editor for a small time tabloid in New York. Being a go-getting workaholic, he often puts his family life aside, which of course puts his very pregnant wife Martha (Marisa Tomei) under a lot of stress especially with her pregnancies woes, and not being able to get out there and do stuff. For their financial stability, one of the many subplots here involves her getting Henry a job interview at a larger paper, The Sentinel, and threatens him not to sabotage his own opportunities for advancement, which we learnt that he does so quite frequently in order to stay where he is. And it's not rocket science why too, as the bunch of folks he's working with is really madcap, and I think I too can thrive in such as a stressful, chaotic, but totally livewire environment. Each character presents a separate subplot which intertwines with Henry's life, and in one scene which I was totally mesmerized with, was when everyone dropped by Henry's office, and it went just off the hook. Wonderful stuff there, especially when you have Glenn Close as a rival sub-editor who happens to be the office bicycle (erm, that means everyone had had a ride), Robert Duvall as an ailing editor stricken with cancer and trying to reconcile with his estranged daughter, and Randy Quaid in a totally hilarious role as the bummer in the office. All these while the team had to debate with the front page story for the next day, centered on reporting what's accurate and doing what's right  the social responsibility in being a paper, with pressure on them because they had missed the previous day's scoop. Everyone's preoccupied with their own personal agenda, set against an office where the air-conditioner isn't working and driving temperatures and tempers up. It's work and family over a period of 24 hours, and I felt that this film had a story that ranks itself up there with other films that deal with their narratives over the same time period. You'd have come to expect a certain assured standard from director Ron Howard, and this film demonstrates nothing less. Everything naturally comes together perfectly toward the end like the birth of a new dawn, with relationships bruised but not battered, and what I also enjoyed here was John Seale's superb cinematography which had this extremely fluid motion when bringing us in and around a newsroom for that office tour each time we run around like crazy with Henry. The paper would be one of my personal favourites, and my only regret (besides the technical aspects of the DVD) was why it had taken me this long to uncover this gem of an enjoyable film.

    Directed by Ron Howard (A Beautiful Mind, The Da Vinci Code) and with an all-star cast, it was impossible for me not to give this comedy drama film a go, and I am so glad I did. Basically, it is 24 hours in the life of an ailing tabloid, with Henry Hackett (Michael Keaton) the editor of the New York Sun, he is a workaholic who loves his job, but at the same time he is struggling to keep up with life with his pregnant wife Martha (Marisa Tomei). Also in the building are publisher/editor-in-chief Bernie White (Robert Duvall) facing financial problems and putting work first instead of family, and Henry's nemesis, managing editor Alicia Clark (Glenn Close) who is planning cutbacks, telling him to consider leaving the New York Sun to be managing editor for the New York Sentinel. The big story on this day is the murder of two white businessman in a race-related killing, and two black brothers passing by are the suspects wrongly jailed. It is when Henry wants a source, he stole the name of, to tell him the truth about the brothers' guilt that the film really gets gripping. He needs a good picture of the brothers, he needs the quote from the source himself, and most important, he needs to change the article that they will release, so he needs to stop the presses! Alicia is not prepared to stop them, and says they will run the innocence story the next day, and she and Henry have an aggressive fight to get to the stop button, but even after Henry has stopped it, she fires him and they restart. Thankfully though she realises her mistake, but a gun shot in the local bar stops her finishing the phone call, and at the same time, Henry's wife is going to hemorrhage, needing anaesthetic for the baby, but don't worry, all problems are solved in the end. Also starring Randy Quaid as Michael McDougal, Jason Robards as Graham Keighley, Jason Alexander as Marion Sandusky, Spalding Gray as Paul Bladden, Catherine O'Hara as Susan, Lynne Thigpen as Janet and Clint Howard (Ron's brother) as Ray Blaisch. I will admit it didn't grip me for the first 20 or so minutes, but after this, it is a engaging and absorbing film all the way. With wisecracking dialogue, well cast actors, especially Keaton and Close, and fantastic manipulative moments, it grips you so much, you are desperate your prediction of events will be right. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for Randy Newman's "Make Up Your Mind". Very good!

There are a number of hurtles to following up on the Williamsburg murder of three prominent bankers who lost several million dollars of the Mafia's money, primary of which is Alicia Clark (Glenn Close) an envious supervisor who is more interested in saving money than the reputations of two black youths. She explains that without more information on the dead men, additional corroboration or a quote by the tight-lipped police, she is running the subway derailment story. Confident he is right, Hackett pulls out all the stops to beat a four hour deadline, attend his wife's (Marisa Tomei) social life, protect his top reporter (Randy Quaid) from a gun-toting parking official (Jason Alexander) and file the story by press time. The movie possess all the exciting impetus of a modern front page story including the daily problems confronting the staff and the personal lives of all concern. The film is powerful in it's direction and will in time be seen as a Journalistic Classic. Easilly recommended for all. ****

    I loved this movie...a real 90s sleeper. It's hard to determine why some films don't get the attention they deserve. The Paper is delightfully acted by an A-list ensemble in their prime. It's hilariously funny, with great timing and pace, and some poignant overtones on commitment, loyalty, family, friendship, work and the workplace, and big city journalism. Feel-good and sardonic at the same time, I did NOT find it completely predictable. The screenplay is terrific, with thoughtful, intelligent, brisk dialog. Not a dull moment; completely entertaining. A film for "grown-ups". More kudos to Ron Howard. Renting it just to watch the superb Glen Close's character, especially in the "stop the presses" scene, is worth the time/money alone. A charming Marisa Tomei perfectly cast. Robert Duvall, Jason Alexander, Jason Robards, and of course Michael Keaton...what's not to like? One of those films that can be watched many times by men and women alike. Highly recommended.

    'The Paper' is solid entertainment. The film shows the high tension jobs of reporters working in a big city tabloid paper. The plot is rather implausible, but the film has a cracking pace and good performances all round. Michael Keaton is dynamite as the workaholic editor of the paper who's immersed in his job and neglecting his pregnant wife Marisa Tomei. Robert Duvall, Glenn Close and Jason Robards all do well in supporting roles. The ending is full of loop-holes but somehow manages to work. Worth watching for it's energy and fine acting. Overall 7/10

    I've been to a newsroom only twice in my life. First, it's to collect some lucky draw winnings, and I had a sneak peek into the hustle and bustle of a newsroom from behind a glass panel. The next one was more up close and personal, because a journalist friend brought me right up to his desk (and an incredibly piled up one at that), and I had first hand view of how news got made. Or at least it seemed that the next day's articles were done up because there were few people left in the office, and there was a group huddled at one corner. Ron Howard's The Paper was one of those films that I didn't catch at the cinemas (at that time, the teenage me only recognized Michael Keaton of his 1989 Batman and 1992 Batman Returns fame), and missed a number of scheduled telecast and re-runs on television. So it's no surprise that I snapped up the DVD the minute I saw it in the discount bins at the store. And I wonder just why the heck it took me so long to get down to watching this, with no regrets (save for the technical aspect of the presentation). Keaton plays a Henry Hackett, a sub-editor for a small time tabloid in New York. Being a go-getting workaholic, he often puts his family life aside, which of course puts his very pregnant wife Martha (Marisa Tomei) under a lot of stress especially with her pregnancies woes, and not being able to get out there and do stuff. For their financial stability, one of the many subplots here involves her getting Henry a job interview at a larger paper, The Sentinel, and threatens him not to sabotage his own opportunities for advancement, which we learnt that he does so quite frequently in order to stay where he is. And it's not rocket science why too, as the bunch of folks he's working with is really madcap, and I think I too can thrive in such as a stressful, chaotic, but totally livewire environment. Each character presents a separate subplot which intertwines with Henry's life, and in one scene which I was totally mesmerized with, was when everyone dropped by Henry's office, and it went just off the hook. Wonderful stuff there, especially when you have Glenn Close as a rival sub-editor who happens to be the office bicycle (erm, that means everyone had had a ride), Robert Duvall as an ailing editor stricken with cancer and trying to reconcile with his estranged daughter, and Randy Quaid in a totally hilarious role as the bummer in the office. All these while the team had to debate with the front page story for the next day, centered on reporting what's accurate and doing what's right  the social responsibility in being a paper, with pressure on them because they had missed the previous day's scoop. Everyone's preoccupied with their own personal agenda, set against an office where the air-conditioner isn't working and driving temperatures and tempers up. It's work and family over a period of 24 hours, and I felt that this film had a story that ranks itself up there with other films that deal with their narratives over the same time period. You'd have come to expect a certain assured standard from director Ron Howard, and this film demonstrates nothing less. Everything naturally comes together perfectly toward the end like the birth of a new dawn, with relationships bruised but not battered, and what I also enjoyed here was John Seale's superb cinematography which had this extremely fluid motion when bringing us in and around a newsroom for that office tour each time we run around like crazy with Henry. The paper would be one of my personal favourites, and my only regret (besides the technical aspects of the DVD) was why it had taken me this long to uncover this gem of an enjoyable film.

    Directed by Ron Howard (A Beautiful Mind, The Da Vinci Code) and with an all-star cast, it was impossible for me not to give this comedy drama film a go, and I am so glad I did. Basically, it is 24 hours in the life of an ailing tabloid, with Henry Hackett (Michael Keaton) the editor of the New York Sun, he is a workaholic who loves his job, but at the same time he is struggling to keep up with life with his pregnant wife Martha (Marisa Tomei). Also in the building are publisher/editor-in-chief Bernie White (Robert Duvall) facing financial problems and putting work first instead of family, and Henry's nemesis, managing editor Alicia Clark (Glenn Close) who is planning cutbacks, telling him to consider leaving the New York Sun to be managing editor for the New York Sentinel. The big story on this day is the murder of two white businessman in a race-related killing, and two black brothers passing by are the suspects wrongly jailed. It is when Henry wants a source, he stole the name of, to tell him the truth about the brothers' guilt that the film really gets gripping. He needs a good picture of the brothers, he needs the quote from the source himself, and most important, he needs to change the article that they will release, so he needs to stop the presses! Alicia is not prepared to stop them, and says they will run the innocence story the next day, and she and Henry have an aggressive fight to get to the stop button, but even after Henry has stopped it, she fires him and they restart. Thankfully though she realises her mistake, but a gun shot in the local bar stops her finishing the phone call, and at the same time, Henry's wife is going to hemorrhage, needing anaesthetic for the baby, but don't worry, all problems are solved in the end. Also starring Randy Quaid as Michael McDougal, Jason Robards as Graham Keighley, Jason Alexander as Marion Sandusky, Spalding Gray as Paul Bladden, Catherine O'Hara as Susan, Lynne Thigpen as Janet and Clint Howard (Ron's brother) as Ray Blaisch. I will admit it didn't grip me for the first 20 or so minutes, but after this, it is a engaging and absorbing film all the way. With wisecracking dialogue, well cast actors, especially Keaton and Close, and fantastic manipulative moments, it grips you so much, you are desperate your prediction of events will be right. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for Randy Newman's "Make Up Your Mind". Very good!

    The Paper is one of those movies I revisit every once in awhile, after having seen it multiple of times when I was younger. And with visit, I fall in love with it all over again. What's funny, with this 8/7/13 latest viewing, is that they knew their kind, back in 1994, was on their way out. Talk about foreshadowing! Now, the newspaper business isn't extinct yet, but probably will be soon. I know I haven't subscribed to a newspaper in probably 15-16 years, but I did love reading them  despite the black fingers and stacks of old papers to be taken out as downfalls. I digress. My point is, if anyone watches this today, for the first time, they may find it completely outdated. Case in point: (chain) smoking in buildings, beepers and least of all: the newspaper business trying to be the first to nab a story when it only publishes once a day and at night. This is sad. This movie is literally action and suspense-packed from minute one. I enjoy the progression of these characters, their deadlines, stress, movements, dialogue and depth. I believe this movie is incredibly made well, fun, funny and is worth every minute of screen time. So, if you're a first time viewer, just think: 1994 and move on and along with these fantastic characters. I also fancy 24-hour movies, or films that take place in one day'ish. This one begins in the morning, and follows reporter/editor Henry (a fantastic performance from Michael Keaton) for one complete day and his plight to tell the truth vs. what's easy to publish that might ruin two boy's lives. They're accused of murder and this particular newspaper's front page (alone) might convict them. He needs to fight deadlines, problems, his own superiors and the pending birth of his first child. You feel every bit of his stress and love it at the same time. Every single actor in this movie gave their 100% and had incredible depth and believability. But, namely, I loved Keaton's Henry, Glenn Close's Alicia, Robert Duvall's Bernie and Randy Quaid's Michael. Notably, and as a TV's The Incredible Hulk fan growing up, it's awesome to see the name "Jack McGee" show up in the credits. (He's a minor character, but that namein association with a movie about an all-but tabloidis gold for a fan of the Hulk series like me.) I don't award too many films with 5/5 stars (or in IMDb's case, 10/10,) but besides the fact I grew up wanting to be a journalist (and studied it in college many moons ago,) I fall more and more in love with this film as the day progresses with each viewing. I love the story, the fast pace, the cinematography, the comedic lines and above all else, the characters. I absolutely love this film. On a side note, it's sad to say, in 1994, and in 2013racial tensions and crimes almost match. This makes this movie relevant, even today, but not for good reasons.

    "The Paper"'s strong suit is its second act, when it's actually being a newspaper movie. Sure, the whole movies set in the offices of a second- rate New York City paper, but most of what goes on in those offices is human drama ... and actually kinda soap opera-ey, at that. Keaton's torn between a better job elsewhere and doing what he's hard-wired to do. It's like "His Girl Friday", but there's no tension or interplay between his character and whomever would substitute Cary Grant, here. And although Keaton is the shining star, there are some good performances from the ensemble cast: Glenn Close, Robert Duvall, Marisa Tomei, and even Randy Quaid). And I did like the uses of wry humor to add levity to the darker scenes. Still not a fan of the blood in the kitchen scene; felt contrived and didn't really go anywhere (did Keaton learn anything from it? Will things change?). Decent movie; at its best when it focuses on the wrongfully-convicted teens story. 6/10

    Beginning with Five Star Final in the early thirties the Talkies have been punctuated with movies about the fourth estate, Bogie did one as did Jack Webb and here is yet another with a not-quite A-list cast but none the worse for that. Essentially it's 24 hours on Grub Street with the likes of Marisa Tomei, Glenn Close, Randy Quaid, Michael Keaton and Jason Robards combining to turn out a Bulldog edition of stylish entertainment. The several plot strands come together when necessary and are otherwise kept apart with the whole offering a satisfying glimpse of life in tabloid land. With luck it should stand up to another viewing via DVD.

    This movie came out right ahead of the surge of DVDs and the phasing out of VHS. It also was a couple of years before I retired, and we weren't watching many movies then. So we missed this one. Finally, today we saw it, very enjoyable with some of our favorite actors. Michael Keaton is Henry Hackett, news editor for a fictitious 2nd-tier newspaper in New York. He is somewhat of a workaholic, to the dismay of his pregnant wife who seldom sees him arrive on time for anything. Now she fears she will be virtually alone to raise their child. Marisa Tomei is his wife, Martha Hackett, in this role right near the same time she won an Oscar for her role in "My Cousin Vinney." She was in her 20s, while Keaton was already in his early 40s. But they make a good match in this newspaper movie. There are several themes, one being Henry's opportunity to leave for a better-paying job with a larger New York paper. Also his feud with the managing editor, the "bean counter" worried about cost, Glenn Close as Alicia Clark. But the core newspaper story involves two men being gunned down in their car, and two young black students being seen near the car. They didn't do it, but were arrested and Henry wants to get to the bottom of the real story, while Alicia wants to get the paper out on deadline. After all the union drivers are waiting, and it costs $12,000 for every half hour they delay! Always reliable Robert Duvall is Bernie White the publisher, fighting his own battles, prostate cancer and an estranged daughter. All in all a good movie.

    Ron Howard is a legendary filmmaker, no two options on that! His body of work is truly admirable, as he has made dozens of memorable films. 'The Paper' is another feather in his well-decorated cap, a film that exposes the behind-the-scenes of a newsroom. It beautifully depicts 24 hours in a newspaper editor's professional and personal life. Howard makes the most believable characters in a subject like this. Each character has a interesting story to tell, which is the U.S.P of this rush-hour flick. As mentioned, It offers Super Entertainment in those 110 minutes. Howard's direction, as always, deserves brownie points. David & Stephen Koepp's screenplay is super, with memorable dialog. John Seale's Cinematography is perfect. Daniel P. Hanley & Mike Hill's editing is flawless. In the acting department, Glenn Close is fantastic. She plays her character flawlessly. Michael Keaton is lovable. One of my all-time favorite actors! Robert Duvall, like always, is restrained and cool. Marisa Tomei is excellent. Randy Quaid is funny, and gets it right. Jason Robards in a cameo, is fine. On the whole, 'The Paper' is a memorable film. An Ideal Sunday Afernoon Watch! Thumbs Up!

    There are not too many solid Newspaper stories which ever make it to the silver Screen. Occasionally one does comes along and if it's message is important with respect towards the audience, it deserves attention. Such a movie is, " The Paper ". The star of the movie is Michael Keaton who plays Henry Hackett a city editor who's boss is Bernie White played by noted actor Robert Duvall. Jason Robards is the Publisher, Graham Keighley. Their newspaper is about to print a story about a local derailment, when a small item arrest in Williamsburg NY, inspires Hackett to risk his position and a promotion with 'The Sentinal'' a prestigious uptown Newspaper. There are a number of hurtles to following up on the Williamsburg murder of three prominent bankers who lost several million dollars of the Mafia's money, primary of which is Alicia Clark (Glenn Close) an envious supervisor who is more interested in saving money than the reputations of two black youths. She explains that without more information on the dead men, additional corroboration or a quote by the tight-lipped police, she is running the subway derailment story. Confident he is right, Hackett pulls out all the stops to beat a four hour deadline, attend his wife's (Marisa Tomei) social life, protect his top reporter (Randy Quaid) from a gun-toting parking official (Jason Alexander) and file the story by press time. The movie possess all the exciting impetus of a modern front page story including the daily problems confronting the staff and the personal lives of all concern. The film is powerful in it's direction and will in time be seen as a Journalistic Classic. Easilly recommended for all. ****

I don't award too many films with 5/5 stars (or in IMDb's case, 10/10,) but besides the fact I grew up wanting to be a journalist (and studied it in college many moons ago,) I fall more and more in love with this film as the day progresses with each viewing. I love the story, the fast pace, the cinematography, the comedic lines and above all else, the characters. I absolutely love this film. On a side note, it's sad to say, in 1994, and in 2013racial tensions and crimes almost match. This makes this movie relevant, even today, but not for good reasons.

    "The Paper"'s strong suit is its second act, when it's actually being a newspaper movie. Sure, the whole movies set in the offices of a second- rate New York City paper, but most of what goes on in those offices is human drama ... and actually kinda soap opera-ey, at that. Keaton's torn between a better job elsewhere and doing what he's hard-wired to do. It's like "His Girl Friday", but there's no tension or interplay between his character and whomever would substitute Cary Grant, here. And although Keaton is the shining star, there are some good performances from the ensemble cast: Glenn Close, Robert Duvall, Marisa Tomei, and even Randy Quaid). And I did like the uses of wry humor to add levity to the darker scenes. Still not a fan of the blood in the kitchen scene; felt contrived and didn't really go anywhere (did Keaton learn anything from it? Will things change?). Decent movie; at its best when it focuses on the wrongfully-convicted teens story. 6/10

    Beginning with Five Star Final in the early thirties the Talkies have been punctuated with movies about the fourth estate, Bogie did one as did Jack Webb and here is yet another with a not-quite A-list cast but none the worse for that. Essentially it's 24 hours on Grub Street with the likes of Marisa Tomei, Glenn Close, Randy Quaid, Michael Keaton and Jason Robards combining to turn out a Bulldog edition of stylish entertainment. The several plot strands come together when necessary and are otherwise kept apart with the whole offering a satisfying glimpse of life in tabloid land. With luck it should stand up to another viewing via DVD.

    This movie came out right ahead of the surge of DVDs and the phasing out of VHS. It also was a couple of years before I retired, and we weren't watching many movies then. So we missed this one. Finally, today we saw it, very enjoyable with some of our favorite actors. Michael Keaton is Henry Hackett, news editor for a fictitious 2nd-tier newspaper in New York. He is somewhat of a workaholic, to the dismay of his pregnant wife who seldom sees him arrive on time for anything. Now she fears she will be virtually alone to raise their child. Marisa Tomei is his wife, Martha Hackett, in this role right near the same time she won an Oscar for her role in "My Cousin Vinney." She was in her 20s, while Keaton was already in his early 40s. But they make a good match in this newspaper movie. There are several themes, one being Henry's opportunity to leave for a better-paying job with a larger New York paper. Also his feud with the managing editor, the "bean counter" worried about cost, Glenn Close as Alicia Clark. But the core newspaper story involves two men being gunned down in their car, and two young black students being seen near the car. They didn't do it, but were arrested and Henry wants to get to the bottom of the real story, while Alicia wants to get the paper out on deadline. After all the union drivers are waiting, and it costs $12,000 for every half hour they delay! Always reliable Robert Duvall is Bernie White the publisher, fighting his own battles, prostate cancer and an estranged daughter. All in all a good movie.

    Ron Howard is a legendary filmmaker, no two options on that! His body of work is truly admirable, as he has made dozens of memorable films. 'The Paper' is another feather in his well-decorated cap, a film that exposes the behind-the-scenes of a newsroom. It beautifully depicts 24 hours in a newspaper editor's professional and personal life. Howard makes the most believable characters in a subject like this. Each character has a interesting story to tell, which is the U.S.P of this rush-hour flick. As mentioned, It offers Super Entertainment in those 110 minutes. Howard's direction, as always, deserves brownie points. David & Stephen Koepp's screenplay is super, with memorable dialog. John Seale's Cinematography is perfect. Daniel P. Hanley & Mike Hill's editing is flawless. In the acting department, Glenn Close is fantastic. She plays her character flawlessly. Michael Keaton is lovable. One of my all-time favorite actors! Robert Duvall, like always, is restrained and cool. Marisa Tomei is excellent. Randy Quaid is funny, and gets it right. Jason Robards in a cameo, is fine. On the whole, 'The Paper' is a memorable film. An Ideal Sunday Afernoon Watch! Thumbs Up!

    There are not too many solid Newspaper stories which ever make it to the silver Screen. Occasionally one does comes along and if it's message is important with respect towards the audience, it deserves attention. Such a movie is, " The Paper ". The star of the movie is Michael Keaton who plays Henry Hackett a city editor who's boss is Bernie White played by noted actor Robert Duvall. Jason Robards is the Publisher, Graham Keighley. Their newspaper is about to print a story about a local derailment, when a small item arrest in Williamsburg NY, inspires Hackett to risk his position and a promotion with 'The Sentinal'' a prestigious uptown Newspaper. There are a number of hurtles to following up on the Williamsburg murder of three prominent bankers who lost several million dollars of the Mafia's money, primary of which is Alicia Clark (Glenn Close) an envious supervisor who is more interested in saving money than the reputations of two black youths. She explains that without more information on the dead men, additional corroboration or a quote by the tight-lipped police, she is running the subway derailment story. Confident he is right, Hackett pulls out all the stops to beat a four hour deadline, attend his wife's (Marisa Tomei) social life, protect his top reporter (Randy Quaid) from a gun-toting parking official (Jason Alexander) and file the story by press time. The movie possess all the exciting impetus of a modern front page story including the daily problems confronting the staff and the personal lives of all concern. The film is powerful in it's direction and will in time be seen as a Journalistic Classic. Easilly recommended for all. ****

    I loved this movie...a real 90s sleeper. It's hard to determine why some films don't get the attention they deserve. The Paper is delightfully acted by an A-list ensemble in their prime. It's hilariously funny, with great timing and pace, and some poignant overtones on commitment, loyalty, family, friendship, work and the workplace, and big city journalism. Feel-good and sardonic at the same time, I did NOT find it completely predictable. The screenplay is terrific, with thoughtful, intelligent, brisk dialog. Not a dull moment; completely entertaining. A film for "grown-ups". More kudos to Ron Howard. Renting it just to watch the superb Glen Close's character, especially in the "stop the presses" scene, is worth the time/money alone. A charming Marisa Tomei perfectly cast. Robert Duvall, Jason Alexander, Jason Robards, and of course Michael Keaton...what's not to like? One of those films that can be watched many times by men and women alike. Highly recommended.

    'The Paper' is solid entertainment. The film shows the high tension jobs of reporters working in a big city tabloid paper. The plot is rather implausible, but the film has a cracking pace and good performances all round. Michael Keaton is dynamite as the workaholic editor of the paper who's immersed in his job and neglecting his pregnant wife Marisa Tomei. Robert Duvall, Glenn Close and Jason Robards all do well in supporting roles. The ending is full of loop-holes but somehow manages to work. Worth watching for it's energy and fine acting. Overall 7/10

    I've been to a newsroom only twice in my life. First, it's to collect some lucky draw winnings, and I had a sneak peek into the hustle and bustle of a newsroom from behind a glass panel. The next one was more up close and personal, because a journalist friend brought me right up to his desk (and an incredibly piled up one at that), and I had first hand view of how news got made. Or at least it seemed that the next day's articles were done up because there were few people left in the office, and there was a group huddled at one corner. Ron Howard's The Paper was one of those films that I didn't catch at the cinemas (at that time, the teenage me only recognized Michael Keaton of his 1989 Batman and 1992 Batman Returns fame), and missed a number of scheduled telecast and re-runs on television. So it's no surprise that I snapped up the DVD the minute I saw it in the discount bins at the store. And I wonder just why the heck it took me so long to get down to watching this, with no regrets (save for the technical aspect of the presentation). Keaton plays a Henry Hackett, a sub-editor for a small time tabloid in New York. Being a go-getting workaholic, he often puts his family life aside, which of course puts his very pregnant wife Martha (Marisa Tomei) under a lot of stress especially with her pregnancies woes, and not being able to get out there and do stuff. For their financial stability, one of the many subplots here involves her getting Henry a job interview at a larger paper, The Sentinel, and threatens him not to sabotage his own opportunities for advancement, which we learnt that he does so quite frequently in order to stay where he is. And it's not rocket science why too, as the bunch of folks he's working with is really madcap, and I think I too can thrive in such as a stressful, chaotic, but totally livewire environment. Each character presents a separate subplot which intertwines with Henry's life, and in one scene which I was totally mesmerized with, was when everyone dropped by Henry's office, and it went just off the hook. Wonderful stuff there, especially when you have Glenn Close as a rival sub-editor who happens to be the office bicycle (erm, that means everyone had had a ride), Robert Duvall as an ailing editor stricken with cancer and trying to reconcile with his estranged daughter, and Randy Quaid in a totally hilarious role as the bummer in the office. All these while the team had to debate with the front page story for the next day, centered on reporting what's accurate and doing what's right  the social responsibility in being a paper, with pressure on them because they had missed the previous day's scoop. Everyone's preoccupied with their own personal agenda, set against an office where the air-conditioner isn't working and driving temperatures and tempers up. It's work and family over a period of 24 hours, and I felt that this film had a story that ranks itself up there with other films that deal with their narratives over the same time period. You'd have come to expect a certain assured standard from director Ron Howard, and this film demonstrates nothing less. Everything naturally comes together perfectly toward the end like the birth of a new dawn, with relationships bruised but not battered, and what I also enjoyed here was John Seale's superb cinematography which had this extremely fluid motion when bringing us in and around a newsroom for that office tour each time we run around like crazy with Henry. The paper would be one of my personal favourites, and my only regret (besides the technical aspects of the DVD) was why it had taken me this long to uncover this gem of an enjoyable film.

    Directed by Ron Howard (A Beautiful Mind, The Da Vinci Code) and with an all-star cast, it was impossible for me not to give this comedy drama film a go, and I am so glad I did. Basically, it is 24 hours in the life of an ailing tabloid, with Henry Hackett (Michael Keaton) the editor of the New York Sun, he is a workaholic who loves his job, but at the same time he is struggling to keep up with life with his pregnant wife Martha (Marisa Tomei). Also in the building are publisher/editor-in-chief Bernie White (Robert Duvall) facing financial problems and putting work first instead of family, and Henry's nemesis, managing editor Alicia Clark (Glenn Close) who is planning cutbacks, telling him to consider leaving the New York Sun to be managing editor for the New York Sentinel. The big story on this day is the murder of two white businessman in a race-related killing, and two black brothers passing by are the suspects wrongly jailed. It is when Henry wants a source, he stole the name of, to tell him the truth about the brothers' guilt that the film really gets gripping. He needs a good picture of the brothers, he needs the quote from the source himself, and most important, he needs to change the article that they will release, so he needs to stop the presses! Alicia is not prepared to stop them, and says they will run the innocence story the next day, and she and Henry have an aggressive fight to get to the stop button, but even after Henry has stopped it, she fires him and they restart. Thankfully though she realises her mistake, but a gun shot in the local bar stops her finishing the phone call, and at the same time, Henry's wife is going to hemorrhage, needing anaesthetic for the baby, but don't worry, all problems are solved in the end. Also starring Randy Quaid as Michael McDougal, Jason Robards as Graham Keighley, Jason Alexander as Marion Sandusky, Spalding Gray as Paul Bladden, Catherine O'Hara as Susan, Lynne Thigpen as Janet and Clint Howard (Ron's brother) as Ray Blaisch. I will admit it didn't grip me for the first 20 or so minutes, but after this, it is a engaging and absorbing film all the way. With wisecracking dialogue, well cast actors, especially Keaton and Close, and fantastic manipulative moments, it grips you so much, you are desperate your prediction of events will be right. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for Randy Newman's "Make Up Your Mind". Very good!

    The Paper is one of those movies I revisit every once in awhile, after having seen it multiple of times when I was younger. And with visit, I fall in love with it all over again. What's funny, with this 8/7/13 latest viewing, is that they knew their kind, back in 1994, was on their way out. Talk about foreshadowing! Now, the newspaper business isn't extinct yet, but probably will be soon. I know I haven't subscribed to a newspaper in probably 15-16 years, but I did love reading them  despite the black fingers and stacks of old papers to be taken out as downfalls. I digress. My point is, if anyone watches this today, for the first time, they may find it completely outdated. Case in point: (chain) smoking in buildings, beepers and least of all: the newspaper business trying to be the first to nab a story when it only publishes once a day and at night. This is sad. This movie is literally action and suspense-packed from minute one. I enjoy the progression of these characters, their deadlines, stress, movements, dialogue and depth. I believe this movie is incredibly made well, fun, funny and is worth every minute of screen time. So, if you're a first time viewer, just think: 1994 and move on and along with these fantastic characters. I also fancy 24-hour movies, or films that take place in one day'ish. This one begins in the morning, and follows reporter/editor Henry (a fantastic performance from Michael Keaton) for one complete day and his plight to tell the truth vs. what's easy to publish that might ruin two boy's lives. They're accused of murder and this particular newspaper's front page (alone) might convict them. He needs to fight deadlines, problems, his own superiors and the pending birth of his first child. You feel every bit of his stress and love it at the same time. Every single actor in this movie gave their 100% and had incredible depth and believability. But, namely, I loved Keaton's Henry, Glenn Close's Alicia, Robert Duvall's Bernie and Randy Quaid's Michael. Notably, and as a TV's The Incredible Hulk fan growing up, it's awesome to see the name "Jack McGee" show up in the credits. (He's a minor character, but that namein association with a movie about an all-but tabloidis gold for a fan of the Hulk series like me.) I don't award too many films with 5/5 stars (or in IMDb's case, 10/10,) but besides the fact I grew up wanting to be a journalist (and studied it in college many moons ago,) I fall more and more in love with this film as the day progresses with each viewing. I love the story, the fast pace, the cinematography, the comedic lines and above all else, the characters. I absolutely love this film. On a side note, it's sad to say, in 1994, and in 2013racial tensions and crimes almost match. This makes this movie relevant, even today, but not for good reasons.

Being a go-getting workaholic, he often puts his family life aside, which of course puts his very pregnant wife Martha (Marisa Tomei) under a lot of stress especially with her pregnancies woes, and not being able to get out there and do stuff. For their financial stability, one of the many subplots here involves her getting Henry a job interview at a larger paper, The Sentinel, and threatens him not to sabotage his own opportunities for advancement, which we learnt that he does so quite frequently in order to stay where he is. And it's not rocket science why too, as the bunch of folks he's working with is really madcap, and I think I too can thrive in such as a stressful, chaotic, but totally livewire environment. Each character presents a separate subplot which intertwines with Henry's life, and in one scene which I was totally mesmerized with, was when everyone dropped by Henry's office, and it went just off the hook. Wonderful stuff there, especially when you have Glenn Close as a rival sub-editor who happens to be the office bicycle (erm, that means everyone had had a ride), Robert Duvall as an ailing editor stricken with cancer and trying to reconcile with his estranged daughter, and Randy Quaid in a totally hilarious role as the bummer in the office. All these while the team had to debate with the front page story for the next day, centered on reporting what's accurate and doing what's right  the social responsibility in being a paper, with pressure on them because they had missed the previous day's scoop. Everyone's preoccupied with their own personal agenda, set against an office where the air-conditioner isn't working and driving temperatures and tempers up. It's work and family over a period of 24 hours, and I felt that this film had a story that ranks itself up there with other films that deal with their narratives over the same time period. You'd have come to expect a certain assured standard from director Ron Howard, and this film demonstrates nothing less. Everything naturally comes together perfectly toward the end like the birth of a new dawn, with relationships bruised but not battered, and what I also enjoyed here was John Seale's superb cinematography which had this extremely fluid motion when bringing us in and around a newsroom for that office tour each time we run around like crazy with Henry. The paper would be one of my personal favourites, and my only regret (besides the technical aspects of the DVD) was why it had taken me this long to uncover this gem of an enjoyable film.

    Directed by Ron Howard (A Beautiful Mind, The Da Vinci Code) and with an all-star cast, it was impossible for me not to give this comedy drama film a go, and I am so glad I did. Basically, it is 24 hours in the life of an ailing tabloid, with Henry Hackett (Michael Keaton) the editor of the New York Sun, he is a workaholic who loves his job, but at the same time he is struggling to keep up with life with his pregnant wife Martha (Marisa Tomei). Also in the building are publisher/editor-in-chief Bernie White (Robert Duvall) facing financial problems and putting work first instead of family, and Henry's nemesis, managing editor Alicia Clark (Glenn Close) who is planning cutbacks, telling him to consider leaving the New York Sun to be managing editor for the New York Sentinel. The big story on this day is the murder of two white businessman in a race-related killing, and two black brothers passing by are the suspects wrongly jailed. It is when Henry wants a source, he stole the name of, to tell him the truth about the brothers' guilt that the film really gets gripping. He needs a good picture of the brothers, he needs the quote from the source himself, and most important, he needs to change the article that they will release, so he needs to stop the presses! Alicia is not prepared to stop them, and says they will run the innocence story the next day, and she and Henry have an aggressive fight to get to the stop button, but even after Henry has stopped it, she fires him and they restart. Thankfully though she realises her mistake, but a gun shot in the local bar stops her finishing the phone call, and at the same time, Henry's wife is going to hemorrhage, needing anaesthetic for the baby, but don't worry, all problems are solved in the end. Also starring Randy Quaid as Michael McDougal, Jason Robards as Graham Keighley, Jason Alexander as Marion Sandusky, Spalding Gray as Paul Bladden, Catherine O'Hara as Susan, Lynne Thigpen as Janet and Clint Howard (Ron's brother) as Ray Blaisch. I will admit it didn't grip me for the first 20 or so minutes, but after this, it is a engaging and absorbing film all the way. With wisecracking dialogue, well cast actors, especially Keaton and Close, and fantastic manipulative moments, it grips you so much, you are desperate your prediction of events will be right. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for Randy Newman's "Make Up Your Mind". Very good!

    The Paper is one of those movies I revisit every once in awhile, after having seen it multiple of times when I was younger. And with visit, I fall in love with it all over again. What's funny, with this 8/7/13 latest viewing, is that they knew their kind, back in 1994, was on their way out. Talk about foreshadowing! Now, the newspaper business isn't extinct yet, but probably will be soon. I know I haven't subscribed to a newspaper in probably 15-16 years, but I did love reading them  despite the black fingers and stacks of old papers to be taken out as downfalls. I digress. My point is, if anyone watches this today, for the first time, they may find it completely outdated. Case in point: (chain) smoking in buildings, beepers and least of all: the newspaper business trying to be the first to nab a story when it only publishes once a day and at night. This is sad. This movie is literally action and suspense-packed from minute one. I enjoy the progression of these characters, their deadlines, stress, movements, dialogue and depth. I believe this movie is incredibly made well, fun, funny and is worth every minute of screen time. So, if you're a first time viewer, just think: 1994 and move on and along with these fantastic characters. I also fancy 24-hour movies, or films that take place in one day'ish. This one begins in the morning, and follows reporter/editor Henry (a fantastic performance from Michael Keaton) for one complete day and his plight to tell the truth vs. what's easy to publish that might ruin two boy's lives. They're accused of murder and this particular newspaper's front page (alone) might convict them. He needs to fight deadlines, problems, his own superiors and the pending birth of his first child. You feel every bit of his stress and love it at the same time. Every single actor in this movie gave their 100% and had incredible depth and believability. But, namely, I loved Keaton's Henry, Glenn Close's Alicia, Robert Duvall's Bernie and Randy Quaid's Michael. Notably, and as a TV's The Incredible Hulk fan growing up, it's awesome to see the name "Jack McGee" show up in the credits. (He's a minor character, but that namein association with a movie about an all-but tabloidis gold for a fan of the Hulk series like me.) I don't award too many films with 5/5 stars (or in IMDb's case, 10/10,) but besides the fact I grew up wanting to be a journalist (and studied it in college many moons ago,) I fall more and more in love with this film as the day progresses with each viewing. I love the story, the fast pace, the cinematography, the comedic lines and above all else, the characters. I absolutely love this film. On a side note, it's sad to say, in 1994, and in 2013racial tensions and crimes almost match. This makes this movie relevant, even today, but not for good reasons.

    "The Paper"'s strong suit is its second act, when it's actually being a newspaper movie. Sure, the whole movies set in the offices of a second- rate New York City paper, but most of what goes on in those offices is human drama ... and actually kinda soap opera-ey, at that. Keaton's torn between a better job elsewhere and doing what he's hard-wired to do. It's like "His Girl Friday", but there's no tension or interplay between his character and whomever would substitute Cary Grant, here. And although Keaton is the shining star, there are some good performances from the ensemble cast: Glenn Close, Robert Duvall, Marisa Tomei, and even Randy Quaid). And I did like the uses of wry humor to add levity to the darker scenes. Still not a fan of the blood in the kitchen scene; felt contrived and didn't really go anywhere (did Keaton learn anything from it? Will things change?). Decent movie; at its best when it focuses on the wrongfully-convicted teens story. 6/10

    Beginning with Five Star Final in the early thirties the Talkies have been punctuated with movies about the fourth estate, Bogie did one as did Jack Webb and here is yet another with a not-quite A-list cast but none the worse for that. Essentially it's 24 hours on Grub Street with the likes of Marisa Tomei, Glenn Close, Randy Quaid, Michael Keaton and Jason Robards combining to turn out a Bulldog edition of stylish entertainment. The several plot strands come together when necessary and are otherwise kept apart with the whole offering a satisfying glimpse of life in tabloid land. With luck it should stand up to another viewing via DVD.

    This movie came out right ahead of the surge of DVDs and the phasing out of VHS. It also was a couple of years before I retired, and we weren't watching many movies then. So we missed this one. Finally, today we saw it, very enjoyable with some of our favorite actors. Michael Keaton is Henry Hackett, news editor for a fictitious 2nd-tier newspaper in New York. He is somewhat of a workaholic, to the dismay of his pregnant wife who seldom sees him arrive on time for anything. Now she fears she will be virtually alone to raise their child. Marisa Tomei is his wife, Martha Hackett, in this role right near the same time she won an Oscar for her role in "My Cousin Vinney." She was in her 20s, while Keaton was already in his early 40s. But they make a good match in this newspaper movie. There are several themes, one being Henry's opportunity to leave for a better-paying job with a larger New York paper. Also his feud with the managing editor, the "bean counter" worried about cost, Glenn Close as Alicia Clark. But the core newspaper story involves two men being gunned down in their car, and two young black students being seen near the car. They didn't do it, but were arrested and Henry wants to get to the bottom of the real story, while Alicia wants to get the paper out on deadline. After all the union drivers are waiting, and it costs $12,000 for every half hour they delay! Always reliable Robert Duvall is Bernie White the publisher, fighting his own battles, prostate cancer and an estranged daughter. All in all a good movie.

    Ron Howard is a legendary filmmaker, no two options on that! His body of work is truly admirable, as he has made dozens of memorable films. 'The Paper' is another feather in his well-decorated cap, a film that exposes the behind-the-scenes of a newsroom. It beautifully depicts 24 hours in a newspaper editor's professional and personal life. Howard makes the most believable characters in a subject like this. Each character has a interesting story to tell, which is the U.S.P of this rush-hour flick. As mentioned, It offers Super Entertainment in those 110 minutes. Howard's direction, as always, deserves brownie points. David & Stephen Koepp's screenplay is super, with memorable dialog. John Seale's Cinematography is perfect. Daniel P. Hanley & Mike Hill's editing is flawless. In the acting department, Glenn Close is fantastic. She plays her character flawlessly. Michael Keaton is lovable. One of my all-time favorite actors! Robert Duvall, like always, is restrained and cool. Marisa Tomei is excellent. Randy Quaid is funny, and gets it right. Jason Robards in a cameo, is fine. On the whole, 'The Paper' is a memorable film. An Ideal Sunday Afernoon Watch! Thumbs Up!

    There are not too many solid Newspaper stories which ever make it to the silver Screen. Occasionally one does comes along and if it's message is important with respect towards the audience, it deserves attention. Such a movie is, " The Paper ". The star of the movie is Michael Keaton who plays Henry Hackett a city editor who's boss is Bernie White played by noted actor Robert Duvall. Jason Robards is the Publisher, Graham Keighley. Their newspaper is about to print a story about a local derailment, when a small item arrest in Williamsburg NY, inspires Hackett to risk his position and a promotion with 'The Sentinal'' a prestigious uptown Newspaper. There are a number of hurtles to following up on the Williamsburg murder of three prominent bankers who lost several million dollars of the Mafia's money, primary of which is Alicia Clark (Glenn Close) an envious supervisor who is more interested in saving money than the reputations of two black youths. She explains that without more information on the dead men, additional corroboration or a quote by the tight-lipped police, she is running the subway derailment story. Confident he is right, Hackett pulls out all the stops to beat a four hour deadline, attend his wife's (Marisa Tomei) social life, protect his top reporter (Randy Quaid) from a gun-toting parking official (Jason Alexander) and file the story by press time. The movie possess all the exciting impetus of a modern front page story including the daily problems confronting the staff and the personal lives of all concern. The film is powerful in it's direction and will in time be seen as a Journalistic Classic. Easilly recommended for all. ****

    I loved this movie...a real 90s sleeper. It's hard to determine why some films don't get the attention they deserve. The Paper is delightfully acted by an A-list ensemble in their prime. It's hilariously funny, with great timing and pace, and some poignant overtones on commitment, loyalty, family, friendship, work and the workplace, and big city journalism. Feel-good and sardonic at the same time, I did NOT find it completely predictable. The screenplay is terrific, with thoughtful, intelligent, brisk dialog. Not a dull moment; completely entertaining. A film for "grown-ups". More kudos to Ron Howard. Renting it just to watch the superb Glen Close's character, especially in the "stop the presses" scene, is worth the time/money alone. A charming Marisa Tomei perfectly cast. Robert Duvall, Jason Alexander, Jason Robards, and of course Michael Keaton...what's not to like? One of those films that can be watched many times by men and women alike. Highly recommended.

    'The Paper' is solid entertainment. The film shows the high tension jobs of reporters working in a big city tabloid paper. The plot is rather implausible, but the film has a cracking pace and good performances all round. Michael Keaton is dynamite as the workaholic editor of the paper who's immersed in his job and neglecting his pregnant wife Marisa Tomei. Robert Duvall, Glenn Close and Jason Robards all do well in supporting roles. The ending is full of loop-holes but somehow manages to work. Worth watching for it's energy and fine acting. Overall 7/10

    I've been to a newsroom only twice in my life. First, it's to collect some lucky draw winnings, and I had a sneak peek into the hustle and bustle of a newsroom from behind a glass panel. The next one was more up close and personal, because a journalist friend brought me right up to his desk (and an incredibly piled up one at that), and I had first hand view of how news got made. Or at least it seemed that the next day's articles were done up because there were few people left in the office, and there was a group huddled at one corner. Ron Howard's The Paper was one of those films that I didn't catch at the cinemas (at that time, the teenage me only recognized Michael Keaton of his 1989 Batman and 1992 Batman Returns fame), and missed a number of scheduled telecast and re-runs on television. So it's no surprise that I snapped up the DVD the minute I saw it in the discount bins at the store. And I wonder just why the heck it took me so long to get down to watching this, with no regrets (save for the technical aspect of the presentation). Keaton plays a Henry Hackett, a sub-editor for a small time tabloid in New York. Being a go-getting workaholic, he often puts his family life aside, which of course puts his very pregnant wife Martha (Marisa Tomei) under a lot of stress especially with her pregnancies woes, and not being able to get out there and do stuff. For their financial stability, one of the many subplots here involves her getting Henry a job interview at a larger paper, The Sentinel, and threatens him not to sabotage his own opportunities for advancement, which we learnt that he does so quite frequently in order to stay where he is. And it's not rocket science why too, as the bunch of folks he's working with is really madcap, and I think I too can thrive in such as a stressful, chaotic, but totally livewire environment. Each character presents a separate subplot which intertwines with Henry's life, and in one scene which I was totally mesmerized with, was when everyone dropped by Henry's office, and it went just off the hook.
