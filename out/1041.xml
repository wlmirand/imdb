    Mickey Gordon is a basketball referee who travels to France to bury his father. Ellen Andrews is living in Paris, and works for the airline he flies with. They meet and fall in love, but their relationship goes through many difficult patches. Their love life is told in flashback by their friends at a restaurant waiting for them to arrive.... Written and directed by Crystal, you'd be forgiven if you'd think it was a vanity project, but he did that two years earlier, this is sort of a reheated version of 'when Harry Met sally' and whilst it never hits the heights of that movie, it's still a classy movie. it's so easy going and laid back, you forgive Crystal for the gags that showcase him, or the incidental music that just goes for your heartstrings at the correct points, or the fact that it gets a little bit too smug for it's own good when we are at the table with the support. it's because crystal knows how to grab the audience and keep them hooked until the end. I know it's no the best movie out there, but it's charming and the cast are brilliant in a 'we've known each other forever' kind of way. Funny stuff, Crystal is a brilliant writer

    For starters, who casts Billy Crystal as a leading man in a romantic love story? Who can believe that any woman would be attracted to him enough to move from Paris to be with him? Another annoying thing is the story being told by a bunch of other barely believable characters. Except for occasional brilliant comedic one-liners, there is nothing redeeming about this film at all. All attempts at creating plot twists fall flat because there are no plot twists, only uninteresting turns that do not really make the movie any more interesting. Verdict? Stay away from this G*d awful movie. These are the 90 or so minutes you will never get back.

    This is possibly the worst date movie since "I Spit on Your Grave". But I loved it. As only the charmingly cynical Billy Crystal can give us, this is the story of what happens AFTER "happily ever after". It exposes all the warts & blemishes & dirty socks that plague an average dysfunctional couple but does it in a funny way that never feels upsetting, disturbing or depressing. Still, don't see it with anyone you're remotely romantic with because it will certainly dispel the charm. On the other hand, if you are already in a dysfunctional relationship, maybe on the verge of a divorce or breakup, then definitely SEE THIS MOVIE. It can be cathartic, better than any $200/hr marriage therapist. After all, what do you have to lose, you miserable schlep? Told in an interesting, non-linear, "Citizen Kane" way (i.e. told in flashback through the subjective interpretations of different characters), it carries a mounting sense of mystery and suspense that keeps you guessing until the very end. That's what separates it from the standard dysfunctional rom-com (romance on the Orient Express?). Agatha Christie would be proud. Where this movie falls slightly short, and the reason why I'm docking it a few stars, is the chemistry between Billy Crystal and Debra Winger. Though both fine actors, I never found them convincing as a couple, not the way we saw with Billy Crystal & Meg Ryan a few years earlier in "When Harry Met Sally". But sheesh, nothing will ever touch that movie, it was so perfect. "Forget Paris" is a great movie to watch and remind yourself that love isn't always Valentine's Day & rose-covered mattresses. But love can still be an interesting ride. It's hard to think of many other films that achieve this. But maybe I'd compare it to "War of the Roses", "Singles" and the classic Kim Novak/Dean Martin flick "Kiss Me, Stupid".

    Forget Paris (Billy Crystal, 1995) is a rather chilly examination of how tricky it can be to forge a happy marriage, with a few cartoonish episodes chucked in alongside. Billy Crystal does his usual schtick as he romances Debra Winger, though the structure is pure Woody Allen - the whole film told by a group of friends at a party - and the foreign funeral set-up half-inched somewhat obviously from Billy Wilder's underrated Avanti!. The result is somewhat unsatisfactory. It's certainly no Moonstruck or Broadway Danny Rose, but it's not even When Harry Met Sally - and the Paris-set sections were disappointingly brief considering I'd just returned from my travels and was secretly hankering for a glossily-photographed sight-seeing tour. There are comic compensations, though. Playing a basketball referee, Crystal's meltdown on the court is the obvious highlight - along with his senile father-in-law's fondness for regurgitating ad slogans. "You asked for it... you got it. Toyota. You asked for it... you got it. Toyota. You asked for it... you got it. Toyota."

    "Forget Paris" is a feel-good romantic comedy about the on again off again relationship between Mickey (Billy Crystal, who also directed, produced and was one of the writers), an NBA referee, and Ellen (Debra Winger), a customer relations trouble shooter for an airline. Friends of sports writer Andy (Joe Mantegna) are gathering at a restaurant to be introduced to Liz (Cynthia Stevenson) before their wedding. Liz comments that how she and Andy met must be the oddest ever (a fax had one digit off in the fax number and went to Andy by mistake). Andy says no, how Mickey met Ellen is the weirdest. They met because she helped him bury his father. That starts the friends telling the story of Mickey and Ellen. Some critics consider this way of telling the story and the plot stale and schmaltzy; but it is so well done that I could care less. The film genre is romantic comedy; this film's strength is the comedy part of that term. I could give examples but comedy is best when the punchline (or its visual equivalent) is unexpected. Let me just say that one of my favorite bits starts with the focus on an organist going through the motions of preparing to play serious music. Billy Crystal is known to be a serious basketball fan and in part the film is like a documentary about refereeing NBA games, with a huge number of basketball stars playing themselves. I was bemused at the end of the credits when the standard disclaimer came up saying that all the characters and names in the film were fictitious. Not hardly in this film. I should mention that Cynthia Stevenson's hysterically tearful performance as Liz listening to Mickey's and Ellen's highs and lows was great. I also loved the sound track. Ella Fitzgerald singing "April in Paris" is so great; also, Billy Holiday doing the opening "Our Love Is Here To Stay." David Sanborn's saxophone version of the "Star Spangled Banner" is also particularly great. My one quibble is that I found Debra Winger's voice very sexy in 1982's "Officer and a Gentleman" and she didn't sound the same in 1995's "Forget Paris." I probably don't sound the same as I did 13 years ago either.

    This movie was always on the top of my waiting list because I just really like romantic American movies that happen in my country. But right now, I receive it more personally than ever! For me too, an unforgettable story has been born on the banks of the Seine (more the VII district for me). So it's really moving (and fun) to share Crystal/Winger romance blooming. It's a sort of "What If". For sure, after the fireworks of the meeting, comes the harsh reality that can threaten it! From that moment, the movie turns feeble because the Crystal character is too egomaniac. For me, the best definition for "Love" is when you can forget yourself, and for that instance, Crystal is very deficient and it appears like a totally different person he was in Paris: he doesn't want to quit his job, he doesn't speak to her father At the same time, Winger shows a lot of compassion and faces great pain for her femininity! It's just too big to be true But, the story is told with a nice gimmick (the memories from their close friends), it has really funny quotes.

    Is there a specific reason why Crystal has not directed more often? I'm feeling like starting a petition and sending a copy of this to anyone who would potentially sign it. He, Mantegna, Kavner(the three reasons I gave it the much-deserved chance), Winger and Stevenson are fantastic. Their performances and the timing, spot-on. This is incredibly funny, in the clever, dry, not trying too hard kind of way. The humor does have a few gross moments, however, apart from that, it's all hilarious, if you're into the sarcastic, at times cynical, type of material. Hardly any gags or jokes fall flat, throughout it. It's well-acted, and the characters are good. In addition, it's highly involving, and you find yourself caring, not just laughing, during this. Part of the emotion comes from the honesty of this, that it isn't your usual romantic comedy of "boy who looks like a male model meets female lead who appears to have stepped right off the train from Glamourville", and so on and so forth. This has ups *and* downs, and goes beyond the superficial level of the Hollywood pap that we all know, without forgetting what genre of film it is. The story is imaginative and holds surprises. The writing is top-notch. Do note that this is not for kids, the rating the MPAA gave it makes sense. There is language and themes herein. I recommend this to any fan of anyone who was part of creating it, Billy in particular. 7/10

    This movie can't quite make up its mind as to what it wants to be, romantic comedy, light drama, slapstick, story of a modern marriage. Couple 'meet cute' in Paris. Debra Winger (Ellen) and Billy Crystal (Mickey) seem like a natural fit. One liner blitzfest, some funny. They get married after a few bumps and a few unrealistic plot contrivances. Then the story of the marriage as viewed through the eyes of Mickey's friends. The films gets seriously dramatic then with infertility problems, career problems, elderly father moving in. Some parts are brilliant - the elderly father particularly, and Mickey throwing his weight around with the twice-as-tall basketball players. Some parts are flat - the sperm rush to the hospital, the marriage counselling. The supporting cast add some value but the movie is all Billy doing his Harry redux from "When Harry Met Sally." It fell a little too flat for me. 6 out of 10.

    "Forget Paris" is on some ways reminiscent of the work of Woody Allen. Billy Crystal is, like Allen, a diminutive New Yorker who started as a stand-up comic before moving into acting, and his character in this film, Mickey Gordon, has something in common with Woody's self-deprecating creations. The story of Mickey and his wife, Ellen, is told in a series of flashbacks by a group of acquaintances over a meal in a restaurant; Allen had used a similar technique in his "Broadway Danny Rose" and was to do so again in "Melinda and Melinda", although in that film the stories told were invented ones. Mickey meets Ellen when he flies to France to bury his father, who has expressed the wish to be buried with his old Army comrades who were killed during the war. On arrival in Paris, however, Mickey finds that his father's coffin has been lost. Ellen is the airline official responsible for helping him find it. That sounds like the opening for a zany, screwball-type comedy or a macabre black comedy, but "Forget Paris" is neither. It is rather a romantic comedy with a difference. Most rom-coms are about courtship, and end with the marriage or engagement of the couple concerned. This one is as much about what comes after marriage as with what leads up to it; the marriage of Mickey and Ellen comes less than halfway through. After the missing coffin is found, Mickey and Ellen have a whirlwind romance in Paris, leading to their marriage and to her leaving her job in Paris to return with him to America. Paris in American films is typically the city of love and romance; one of these, "An American in Paris", is referred to a number of times. Mickey even sings one of the songs from that film, "Our Love is Here to Stay". The title, "Forget Paris", a phrase used a number of times in the course of their marriage, therefore becomes shorthand for "We've got to put the courtship phase of our relationship behind us and move on to dealing with the problems of married life together". And Mickey and Ellen have plenty of problems. They are unable to have children, and their relationship is put under stress by their contrasting lifestyles. Ellen, cultured and sophisticated, would prefer to live in Paris, but reluctantly agrees to return to America. Mickey is a basketball referee, which means that he spends much of the time travelling around America, leaving Ellen at home. She tries to persuade him to quit his job so that they can spend more time together, and this leads to quarrels between them. Further strain is caused by the arrival of Ellen's irritating elderly father Arthur. Eventually they separate, and Ellen returns to Paris. The title therefore takes on added significance; can Ellen forget Paris, or will she end up forgetting Mickey? Some reviewers have taken exception to the happy ending, such as James Berardinelli, who accused it of lacking "emotional honesty". Of course, it would have been quite possible to turn the story of Mickey and Ellen into a serious study of a failing marriage, but "Forget Paris" was never intended to be a film of that sort. In my view, a happy ending is the only one possible; an unhappy ending to a romantic comedy would be about as appropriate as a series of strident dissonances at the end of a Mozart symphony. And "Forget Paris" is clearly designed to be comic, not tragic. The two leading actors are very different in their styles of acting. As I stated, Billy Crystal started as a stand-up comedian, and specialises in comedies. (I would find it difficult to imagine him in a serious film). He was, of course, the star of "When Harry Met Sally", one of the best romantic comedies of the eighties. Debra Winger, on the other hand, is not an actress I would normally have associated with comedy. In early films such as "Cannery Row" or "An Officer and a Gentleman" she played attractive, vivacious characters, but she later became a rather intense actress, at her best in serious dramas like "Betrayed", "Shadowlands", "Black Widow" or "A Dangerous Woman". I never cared for that lugubrious romantic tragedy "Terms of Endearment", but the fact that Winger won a "Best Actress" Oscar suggests that a lot of other people liked it. The point of casting two such dissimilar actors may have been to emphasise the contrast in character between Mickey and Ellen, a contrast that would have been lessened if Ellen had been played by an experienced romantic comedy actress such as Meg Ryan, Crystal's co-star in "When Harry Met Sally". Winger's performance here suggests that she is not perhaps the world's most naturally gifted comedienne, but she still makes an endearing, if rather earnest, heroine. The difficulties in the Gordons' marriage may stem from the fact that Ellen is a fundamentally more serious person than Mickey, except perhaps where basketball is concerned. (Even the name Mickey, with its associations with Mickey Mouse and "taking the mickey", suggests someone less serious than a Michael or even a Mike). Crystal is very funny in this film, and most of the best lines go to him, although there are also some good contributions from the assembled diners. ("Marriages don't work when one partner is happy and the other is miserable. Marriage is about both people being equally miserable"- that one could be straight out of Woody Allen). There are also some great set pieces, such as the scene in the fertility clinic and the one where Ellen gets a pigeon stuck to her head. Overall, this is an amusing and likable romantic comedy. 7/10

    Billy Crystal was his normal funny self, evoking a number of laughs in here BUT, lest you think this is a comedy, it's more of a drama....much more. I say that because much of this shows a courtship and a marriage. The courtship is romantic and cute, of course, but the marriage are not. Things don't work out between Crystal's "Mickey Gordon-" and Debra Winger's "Ellen" and many of the scenes with them arguing are not fun to watch. It fact, some are downright uncomfortable. I'm not a fan of Winger's low and raspy voice, nor seeing marriages crumble. Thus, my favorite parts of this film were all in the beginning, especially when "Mickey" was an NBA referee. A few basketball stars got a chance to act, too, showing they should stick with sports. Crystal is a big sports fan so I'm sure enjoyed that segment of the movie. Also commendable are the nice shots of Paris. I never get tired of looking at that city, no matter what film.

This is incredibly funny, in the clever, dry, not trying too hard kind of way. The humor does have a few gross moments, however, apart from that, it's all hilarious, if you're into the sarcastic, at times cynical, type of material. Hardly any gags or jokes fall flat, throughout it. It's well-acted, and the characters are good. In addition, it's highly involving, and you find yourself caring, not just laughing, during this. Part of the emotion comes from the honesty of this, that it isn't your usual romantic comedy of "boy who looks like a male model meets female lead who appears to have stepped right off the train from Glamourville", and so on and so forth. This has ups *and* downs, and goes beyond the superficial level of the Hollywood pap that we all know, without forgetting what genre of film it is. The story is imaginative and holds surprises. The writing is top-notch. Do note that this is not for kids, the rating the MPAA gave it makes sense. There is language and themes herein. I recommend this to any fan of anyone who was part of creating it, Billy in particular. 7/10

    This movie can't quite make up its mind as to what it wants to be, romantic comedy, light drama, slapstick, story of a modern marriage. Couple 'meet cute' in Paris. Debra Winger (Ellen) and Billy Crystal (Mickey) seem like a natural fit. One liner blitzfest, some funny. They get married after a few bumps and a few unrealistic plot contrivances. Then the story of the marriage as viewed through the eyes of Mickey's friends. The films gets seriously dramatic then with infertility problems, career problems, elderly father moving in. Some parts are brilliant - the elderly father particularly, and Mickey throwing his weight around with the twice-as-tall basketball players. Some parts are flat - the sperm rush to the hospital, the marriage counselling. The supporting cast add some value but the movie is all Billy doing his Harry redux from "When Harry Met Sally." It fell a little too flat for me. 6 out of 10.

    "Forget Paris" is on some ways reminiscent of the work of Woody Allen. Billy Crystal is, like Allen, a diminutive New Yorker who started as a stand-up comic before moving into acting, and his character in this film, Mickey Gordon, has something in common with Woody's self-deprecating creations. The story of Mickey and his wife, Ellen, is told in a series of flashbacks by a group of acquaintances over a meal in a restaurant; Allen had used a similar technique in his "Broadway Danny Rose" and was to do so again in "Melinda and Melinda", although in that film the stories told were invented ones. Mickey meets Ellen when he flies to France to bury his father, who has expressed the wish to be buried with his old Army comrades who were killed during the war. On arrival in Paris, however, Mickey finds that his father's coffin has been lost. Ellen is the airline official responsible for helping him find it. That sounds like the opening for a zany, screwball-type comedy or a macabre black comedy, but "Forget Paris" is neither. It is rather a romantic comedy with a difference. Most rom-coms are about courtship, and end with the marriage or engagement of the couple concerned. This one is as much about what comes after marriage as with what leads up to it; the marriage of Mickey and Ellen comes less than halfway through. After the missing coffin is found, Mickey and Ellen have a whirlwind romance in Paris, leading to their marriage and to her leaving her job in Paris to return with him to America. Paris in American films is typically the city of love and romance; one of these, "An American in Paris", is referred to a number of times. Mickey even sings one of the songs from that film, "Our Love is Here to Stay". The title, "Forget Paris", a phrase used a number of times in the course of their marriage, therefore becomes shorthand for "We've got to put the courtship phase of our relationship behind us and move on to dealing with the problems of married life together". And Mickey and Ellen have plenty of problems. They are unable to have children, and their relationship is put under stress by their contrasting lifestyles. Ellen, cultured and sophisticated, would prefer to live in Paris, but reluctantly agrees to return to America. Mickey is a basketball referee, which means that he spends much of the time travelling around America, leaving Ellen at home. She tries to persuade him to quit his job so that they can spend more time together, and this leads to quarrels between them. Further strain is caused by the arrival of Ellen's irritating elderly father Arthur. Eventually they separate, and Ellen returns to Paris. The title therefore takes on added significance; can Ellen forget Paris, or will she end up forgetting Mickey? Some reviewers have taken exception to the happy ending, such as James Berardinelli, who accused it of lacking "emotional honesty". Of course, it would have been quite possible to turn the story of Mickey and Ellen into a serious study of a failing marriage, but "Forget Paris" was never intended to be a film of that sort. In my view, a happy ending is the only one possible; an unhappy ending to a romantic comedy would be about as appropriate as a series of strident dissonances at the end of a Mozart symphony. And "Forget Paris" is clearly designed to be comic, not tragic. The two leading actors are very different in their styles of acting. As I stated, Billy Crystal started as a stand-up comedian, and specialises in comedies. (I would find it difficult to imagine him in a serious film). He was, of course, the star of "When Harry Met Sally", one of the best romantic comedies of the eighties. Debra Winger, on the other hand, is not an actress I would normally have associated with comedy. In early films such as "Cannery Row" or "An Officer and a Gentleman" she played attractive, vivacious characters, but she later became a rather intense actress, at her best in serious dramas like "Betrayed", "Shadowlands", "Black Widow" or "A Dangerous Woman". I never cared for that lugubrious romantic tragedy "Terms of Endearment", but the fact that Winger won a "Best Actress" Oscar suggests that a lot of other people liked it. The point of casting two such dissimilar actors may have been to emphasise the contrast in character between Mickey and Ellen, a contrast that would have been lessened if Ellen had been played by an experienced romantic comedy actress such as Meg Ryan, Crystal's co-star in "When Harry Met Sally". Winger's performance here suggests that she is not perhaps the world's most naturally gifted comedienne, but she still makes an endearing, if rather earnest, heroine. The difficulties in the Gordons' marriage may stem from the fact that Ellen is a fundamentally more serious person than Mickey, except perhaps where basketball is concerned. (Even the name Mickey, with its associations with Mickey Mouse and "taking the mickey", suggests someone less serious than a Michael or even a Mike). Crystal is very funny in this film, and most of the best lines go to him, although there are also some good contributions from the assembled diners. ("Marriages don't work when one partner is happy and the other is miserable. Marriage is about both people being equally miserable"- that one could be straight out of Woody Allen). There are also some great set pieces, such as the scene in the fertility clinic and the one where Ellen gets a pigeon stuck to her head. Overall, this is an amusing and likable romantic comedy. 7/10

    Billy Crystal was his normal funny self, evoking a number of laughs in here BUT, lest you think this is a comedy, it's more of a drama....much more. I say that because much of this shows a courtship and a marriage. The courtship is romantic and cute, of course, but the marriage are not. Things don't work out between Crystal's "Mickey Gordon-" and Debra Winger's "Ellen" and many of the scenes with them arguing are not fun to watch. It fact, some are downright uncomfortable. I'm not a fan of Winger's low and raspy voice, nor seeing marriages crumble. Thus, my favorite parts of this film were all in the beginning, especially when "Mickey" was an NBA referee. A few basketball stars got a chance to act, too, showing they should stick with sports. Crystal is a big sports fan so I'm sure enjoyed that segment of the movie. Also commendable are the nice shots of Paris. I never get tired of looking at that city, no matter what film.

    Mickey Gordon is a basketball referee who travels to France to bury his father. Ellen Andrews is living in Paris, and works for the airline he flies with. They meet and fall in love, but their relationship goes through many difficult patches. Their love life is told in flashback by their friends at a restaurant waiting for them to arrive.... Written and directed by Crystal, you'd be forgiven if you'd think it was a vanity project, but he did that two years earlier, this is sort of a reheated version of 'when Harry Met sally' and whilst it never hits the heights of that movie, it's still a classy movie. it's so easy going and laid back, you forgive Crystal for the gags that showcase him, or the incidental music that just goes for your heartstrings at the correct points, or the fact that it gets a little bit too smug for it's own good when we are at the table with the support. it's because crystal knows how to grab the audience and keep them hooked until the end. I know it's no the best movie out there, but it's charming and the cast are brilliant in a 'we've known each other forever' kind of way. Funny stuff, Crystal is a brilliant writer

    For starters, who casts Billy Crystal as a leading man in a romantic love story? Who can believe that any woman would be attracted to him enough to move from Paris to be with him? Another annoying thing is the story being told by a bunch of other barely believable characters. Except for occasional brilliant comedic one-liners, there is nothing redeeming about this film at all. All attempts at creating plot twists fall flat because there are no plot twists, only uninteresting turns that do not really make the movie any more interesting. Verdict? Stay away from this G*d awful movie. These are the 90 or so minutes you will never get back.

    This is possibly the worst date movie since "I Spit on Your Grave". But I loved it. As only the charmingly cynical Billy Crystal can give us, this is the story of what happens AFTER "happily ever after". It exposes all the warts & blemishes & dirty socks that plague an average dysfunctional couple but does it in a funny way that never feels upsetting, disturbing or depressing. Still, don't see it with anyone you're remotely romantic with because it will certainly dispel the charm. On the other hand, if you are already in a dysfunctional relationship, maybe on the verge of a divorce or breakup, then definitely SEE THIS MOVIE. It can be cathartic, better than any $200/hr marriage therapist. After all, what do you have to lose, you miserable schlep? Told in an interesting, non-linear, "Citizen Kane" way (i.e. told in flashback through the subjective interpretations of different characters), it carries a mounting sense of mystery and suspense that keeps you guessing until the very end. That's what separates it from the standard dysfunctional rom-com (romance on the Orient Express?). Agatha Christie would be proud. Where this movie falls slightly short, and the reason why I'm docking it a few stars, is the chemistry between Billy Crystal and Debra Winger. Though both fine actors, I never found them convincing as a couple, not the way we saw with Billy Crystal & Meg Ryan a few years earlier in "When Harry Met Sally". But sheesh, nothing will ever touch that movie, it was so perfect. "Forget Paris" is a great movie to watch and remind yourself that love isn't always Valentine's Day & rose-covered mattresses. But love can still be an interesting ride. It's hard to think of many other films that achieve this. But maybe I'd compare it to "War of the Roses", "Singles" and the classic Kim Novak/Dean Martin flick "Kiss Me, Stupid".

    Forget Paris (Billy Crystal, 1995) is a rather chilly examination of how tricky it can be to forge a happy marriage, with a few cartoonish episodes chucked in alongside. Billy Crystal does his usual schtick as he romances Debra Winger, though the structure is pure Woody Allen - the whole film told by a group of friends at a party - and the foreign funeral set-up half-inched somewhat obviously from Billy Wilder's underrated Avanti!. The result is somewhat unsatisfactory. It's certainly no Moonstruck or Broadway Danny Rose, but it's not even When Harry Met Sally - and the Paris-set sections were disappointingly brief considering I'd just returned from my travels and was secretly hankering for a glossily-photographed sight-seeing tour. There are comic compensations, though. Playing a basketball referee, Crystal's meltdown on the court is the obvious highlight - along with his senile father-in-law's fondness for regurgitating ad slogans. "You asked for it... you got it. Toyota. You asked for it... you got it. Toyota. You asked for it... you got it. Toyota."

    "Forget Paris" is a feel-good romantic comedy about the on again off again relationship between Mickey (Billy Crystal, who also directed, produced and was one of the writers), an NBA referee, and Ellen (Debra Winger), a customer relations trouble shooter for an airline. Friends of sports writer Andy (Joe Mantegna) are gathering at a restaurant to be introduced to Liz (Cynthia Stevenson) before their wedding. Liz comments that how she and Andy met must be the oddest ever (a fax had one digit off in the fax number and went to Andy by mistake). Andy says no, how Mickey met Ellen is the weirdest. They met because she helped him bury his father. That starts the friends telling the story of Mickey and Ellen. Some critics consider this way of telling the story and the plot stale and schmaltzy; but it is so well done that I could care less. The film genre is romantic comedy; this film's strength is the comedy part of that term. I could give examples but comedy is best when the punchline (or its visual equivalent) is unexpected. Let me just say that one of my favorite bits starts with the focus on an organist going through the motions of preparing to play serious music. Billy Crystal is known to be a serious basketball fan and in part the film is like a documentary about refereeing NBA games, with a huge number of basketball stars playing themselves. I was bemused at the end of the credits when the standard disclaimer came up saying that all the characters and names in the film were fictitious. Not hardly in this film. I should mention that Cynthia Stevenson's hysterically tearful performance as Liz listening to Mickey's and Ellen's highs and lows was great. I also loved the sound track. Ella Fitzgerald singing "April in Paris" is so great; also, Billy Holiday doing the opening "Our Love Is Here To Stay." David Sanborn's saxophone version of the "Star Spangled Banner" is also particularly great. My one quibble is that I found Debra Winger's voice very sexy in 1982's "Officer and a Gentleman" and she didn't sound the same in 1995's "Forget Paris." I probably don't sound the same as I did 13 years ago either.

    This movie was always on the top of my waiting list because I just really like romantic American movies that happen in my country. But right now, I receive it more personally than ever! For me too, an unforgettable story has been born on the banks of the Seine (more the VII district for me). So it's really moving (and fun) to share Crystal/Winger romance blooming. It's a sort of "What If". For sure, after the fireworks of the meeting, comes the harsh reality that can threaten it! From that moment, the movie turns feeble because the Crystal character is too egomaniac. For me, the best definition for "Love" is when you can forget yourself, and for that instance, Crystal is very deficient and it appears like a totally different person he was in Paris: he doesn't want to quit his job, he doesn't speak to her father At the same time, Winger shows a lot of compassion and faces great pain for her femininity! It's just too big to be true But, the story is told with a nice gimmick (the memories from their close friends), it has really funny quotes.

It can be cathartic, better than any $200/hr marriage therapist. After all, what do you have to lose, you miserable schlep? Told in an interesting, non-linear, "Citizen Kane" way (i.e. told in flashback through the subjective interpretations of different characters), it carries a mounting sense of mystery and suspense that keeps you guessing until the very end. That's what separates it from the standard dysfunctional rom-com (romance on the Orient Express?). Agatha Christie would be proud. Where this movie falls slightly short, and the reason why I'm docking it a few stars, is the chemistry between Billy Crystal and Debra Winger. Though both fine actors, I never found them convincing as a couple, not the way we saw with Billy Crystal & Meg Ryan a few years earlier in "When Harry Met Sally". But sheesh, nothing will ever touch that movie, it was so perfect. "Forget Paris" is a great movie to watch and remind yourself that love isn't always Valentine's Day & rose-covered mattresses. But love can still be an interesting ride. It's hard to think of many other films that achieve this. But maybe I'd compare it to "War of the Roses", "Singles" and the classic Kim Novak/Dean Martin flick "Kiss Me, Stupid".

    Forget Paris (Billy Crystal, 1995) is a rather chilly examination of how tricky it can be to forge a happy marriage, with a few cartoonish episodes chucked in alongside. Billy Crystal does his usual schtick as he romances Debra Winger, though the structure is pure Woody Allen - the whole film told by a group of friends at a party - and the foreign funeral set-up half-inched somewhat obviously from Billy Wilder's underrated Avanti!. The result is somewhat unsatisfactory. It's certainly no Moonstruck or Broadway Danny Rose, but it's not even When Harry Met Sally - and the Paris-set sections were disappointingly brief considering I'd just returned from my travels and was secretly hankering for a glossily-photographed sight-seeing tour. There are comic compensations, though. Playing a basketball referee, Crystal's meltdown on the court is the obvious highlight - along with his senile father-in-law's fondness for regurgitating ad slogans. "You asked for it... you got it. Toyota. You asked for it... you got it. Toyota. You asked for it... you got it. Toyota."

    "Forget Paris" is a feel-good romantic comedy about the on again off again relationship between Mickey (Billy Crystal, who also directed, produced and was one of the writers), an NBA referee, and Ellen (Debra Winger), a customer relations trouble shooter for an airline. Friends of sports writer Andy (Joe Mantegna) are gathering at a restaurant to be introduced to Liz (Cynthia Stevenson) before their wedding. Liz comments that how she and Andy met must be the oddest ever (a fax had one digit off in the fax number and went to Andy by mistake). Andy says no, how Mickey met Ellen is the weirdest. They met because she helped him bury his father. That starts the friends telling the story of Mickey and Ellen. Some critics consider this way of telling the story and the plot stale and schmaltzy; but it is so well done that I could care less. The film genre is romantic comedy; this film's strength is the comedy part of that term. I could give examples but comedy is best when the punchline (or its visual equivalent) is unexpected. Let me just say that one of my favorite bits starts with the focus on an organist going through the motions of preparing to play serious music. Billy Crystal is known to be a serious basketball fan and in part the film is like a documentary about refereeing NBA games, with a huge number of basketball stars playing themselves. I was bemused at the end of the credits when the standard disclaimer came up saying that all the characters and names in the film were fictitious. Not hardly in this film. I should mention that Cynthia Stevenson's hysterically tearful performance as Liz listening to Mickey's and Ellen's highs and lows was great. I also loved the sound track. Ella Fitzgerald singing "April in Paris" is so great; also, Billy Holiday doing the opening "Our Love Is Here To Stay." David Sanborn's saxophone version of the "Star Spangled Banner" is also particularly great. My one quibble is that I found Debra Winger's voice very sexy in 1982's "Officer and a Gentleman" and she didn't sound the same in 1995's "Forget Paris." I probably don't sound the same as I did 13 years ago either.

    This movie was always on the top of my waiting list because I just really like romantic American movies that happen in my country. But right now, I receive it more personally than ever! For me too, an unforgettable story has been born on the banks of the Seine (more the VII district for me). So it's really moving (and fun) to share Crystal/Winger romance blooming. It's a sort of "What If". For sure, after the fireworks of the meeting, comes the harsh reality that can threaten it! From that moment, the movie turns feeble because the Crystal character is too egomaniac. For me, the best definition for "Love" is when you can forget yourself, and for that instance, Crystal is very deficient and it appears like a totally different person he was in Paris: he doesn't want to quit his job, he doesn't speak to her father At the same time, Winger shows a lot of compassion and faces great pain for her femininity! It's just too big to be true But, the story is told with a nice gimmick (the memories from their close friends), it has really funny quotes.

    Is there a specific reason why Crystal has not directed more often? I'm feeling like starting a petition and sending a copy of this to anyone who would potentially sign it. He, Mantegna, Kavner(the three reasons I gave it the much-deserved chance), Winger and Stevenson are fantastic. Their performances and the timing, spot-on. This is incredibly funny, in the clever, dry, not trying too hard kind of way. The humor does have a few gross moments, however, apart from that, it's all hilarious, if you're into the sarcastic, at times cynical, type of material. Hardly any gags or jokes fall flat, throughout it. It's well-acted, and the characters are good. In addition, it's highly involving, and you find yourself caring, not just laughing, during this. Part of the emotion comes from the honesty of this, that it isn't your usual romantic comedy of "boy who looks like a male model meets female lead who appears to have stepped right off the train from Glamourville", and so on and so forth. This has ups *and* downs, and goes beyond the superficial level of the Hollywood pap that we all know, without forgetting what genre of film it is. The story is imaginative and holds surprises. The writing is top-notch. Do note that this is not for kids, the rating the MPAA gave it makes sense. There is language and themes herein. I recommend this to any fan of anyone who was part of creating it, Billy in particular. 7/10

    This movie can't quite make up its mind as to what it wants to be, romantic comedy, light drama, slapstick, story of a modern marriage. Couple 'meet cute' in Paris. Debra Winger (Ellen) and Billy Crystal (Mickey) seem like a natural fit. One liner blitzfest, some funny. They get married after a few bumps and a few unrealistic plot contrivances. Then the story of the marriage as viewed through the eyes of Mickey's friends. The films gets seriously dramatic then with infertility problems, career problems, elderly father moving in. Some parts are brilliant - the elderly father particularly, and Mickey throwing his weight around with the twice-as-tall basketball players. Some parts are flat - the sperm rush to the hospital, the marriage counselling. The supporting cast add some value but the movie is all Billy doing his Harry redux from "When Harry Met Sally." It fell a little too flat for me. 6 out of 10.

    "Forget Paris" is on some ways reminiscent of the work of Woody Allen. Billy Crystal is, like Allen, a diminutive New Yorker who started as a stand-up comic before moving into acting, and his character in this film, Mickey Gordon, has something in common with Woody's self-deprecating creations. The story of Mickey and his wife, Ellen, is told in a series of flashbacks by a group of acquaintances over a meal in a restaurant; Allen had used a similar technique in his "Broadway Danny Rose" and was to do so again in "Melinda and Melinda", although in that film the stories told were invented ones. Mickey meets Ellen when he flies to France to bury his father, who has expressed the wish to be buried with his old Army comrades who were killed during the war. On arrival in Paris, however, Mickey finds that his father's coffin has been lost. Ellen is the airline official responsible for helping him find it. That sounds like the opening for a zany, screwball-type comedy or a macabre black comedy, but "Forget Paris" is neither. It is rather a romantic comedy with a difference. Most rom-coms are about courtship, and end with the marriage or engagement of the couple concerned. This one is as much about what comes after marriage as with what leads up to it; the marriage of Mickey and Ellen comes less than halfway through. After the missing coffin is found, Mickey and Ellen have a whirlwind romance in Paris, leading to their marriage and to her leaving her job in Paris to return with him to America. Paris in American films is typically the city of love and romance; one of these, "An American in Paris", is referred to a number of times. Mickey even sings one of the songs from that film, "Our Love is Here to Stay". The title, "Forget Paris", a phrase used a number of times in the course of their marriage, therefore becomes shorthand for "We've got to put the courtship phase of our relationship behind us and move on to dealing with the problems of married life together". And Mickey and Ellen have plenty of problems. They are unable to have children, and their relationship is put under stress by their contrasting lifestyles. Ellen, cultured and sophisticated, would prefer to live in Paris, but reluctantly agrees to return to America. Mickey is a basketball referee, which means that he spends much of the time travelling around America, leaving Ellen at home. She tries to persuade him to quit his job so that they can spend more time together, and this leads to quarrels between them. Further strain is caused by the arrival of Ellen's irritating elderly father Arthur. Eventually they separate, and Ellen returns to Paris. The title therefore takes on added significance; can Ellen forget Paris, or will she end up forgetting Mickey? Some reviewers have taken exception to the happy ending, such as James Berardinelli, who accused it of lacking "emotional honesty". Of course, it would have been quite possible to turn the story of Mickey and Ellen into a serious study of a failing marriage, but "Forget Paris" was never intended to be a film of that sort. In my view, a happy ending is the only one possible; an unhappy ending to a romantic comedy would be about as appropriate as a series of strident dissonances at the end of a Mozart symphony. And "Forget Paris" is clearly designed to be comic, not tragic. The two leading actors are very different in their styles of acting. As I stated, Billy Crystal started as a stand-up comedian, and specialises in comedies. (I would find it difficult to imagine him in a serious film). He was, of course, the star of "When Harry Met Sally", one of the best romantic comedies of the eighties. Debra Winger, on the other hand, is not an actress I would normally have associated with comedy. In early films such as "Cannery Row" or "An Officer and a Gentleman" she played attractive, vivacious characters, but she later became a rather intense actress, at her best in serious dramas like "Betrayed", "Shadowlands", "Black Widow" or "A Dangerous Woman". I never cared for that lugubrious romantic tragedy "Terms of Endearment", but the fact that Winger won a "Best Actress" Oscar suggests that a lot of other people liked it. The point of casting two such dissimilar actors may have been to emphasise the contrast in character between Mickey and Ellen, a contrast that would have been lessened if Ellen had been played by an experienced romantic comedy actress such as Meg Ryan, Crystal's co-star in "When Harry Met Sally". Winger's performance here suggests that she is not perhaps the world's most naturally gifted comedienne, but she still makes an endearing, if rather earnest, heroine. The difficulties in the Gordons' marriage may stem from the fact that Ellen is a fundamentally more serious person than Mickey, except perhaps where basketball is concerned. (Even the name Mickey, with its associations with Mickey Mouse and "taking the mickey", suggests someone less serious than a Michael or even a Mike). Crystal is very funny in this film, and most of the best lines go to him, although there are also some good contributions from the assembled diners. ("Marriages don't work when one partner is happy and the other is miserable. Marriage is about both people being equally miserable"- that one could be straight out of Woody Allen). There are also some great set pieces, such as the scene in the fertility clinic and the one where Ellen gets a pigeon stuck to her head. Overall, this is an amusing and likable romantic comedy. 7/10

    Billy Crystal was his normal funny self, evoking a number of laughs in here BUT, lest you think this is a comedy, it's more of a drama....much more. I say that because much of this shows a courtship and a marriage. The courtship is romantic and cute, of course, but the marriage are not. Things don't work out between Crystal's "Mickey Gordon-" and Debra Winger's "Ellen" and many of the scenes with them arguing are not fun to watch. It fact, some are downright uncomfortable. I'm not a fan of Winger's low and raspy voice, nor seeing marriages crumble. Thus, my favorite parts of this film were all in the beginning, especially when "Mickey" was an NBA referee. A few basketball stars got a chance to act, too, showing they should stick with sports. Crystal is a big sports fan so I'm sure enjoyed that segment of the movie. Also commendable are the nice shots of Paris. I never get tired of looking at that city, no matter what film.

    Mickey Gordon is a basketball referee who travels to France to bury his father. Ellen Andrews is living in Paris, and works for the airline he flies with. They meet and fall in love, but their relationship goes through many difficult patches. Their love life is told in flashback by their friends at a restaurant waiting for them to arrive.... Written and directed by Crystal, you'd be forgiven if you'd think it was a vanity project, but he did that two years earlier, this is sort of a reheated version of 'when Harry Met sally' and whilst it never hits the heights of that movie, it's still a classy movie. it's so easy going and laid back, you forgive Crystal for the gags that showcase him, or the incidental music that just goes for your heartstrings at the correct points, or the fact that it gets a little bit too smug for it's own good when we are at the table with the support. it's because crystal knows how to grab the audience and keep them hooked until the end. I know it's no the best movie out there, but it's charming and the cast are brilliant in a 'we've known each other forever' kind of way. Funny stuff, Crystal is a brilliant writer

    For starters, who casts Billy Crystal as a leading man in a romantic love story? Who can believe that any woman would be attracted to him enough to move from Paris to be with him? Another annoying thing is the story being told by a bunch of other barely believable characters. Except for occasional brilliant comedic one-liners, there is nothing redeeming about this film at all. All attempts at creating plot twists fall flat because there are no plot twists, only uninteresting turns that do not really make the movie any more interesting. Verdict? Stay away from this G*d awful movie. These are the 90 or so minutes you will never get back.

    This is possibly the worst date movie since "I Spit on Your Grave". But I loved it. As only the charmingly cynical Billy Crystal can give us, this is the story of what happens AFTER "happily ever after". It exposes all the warts & blemishes & dirty socks that plague an average dysfunctional couple but does it in a funny way that never feels upsetting, disturbing or depressing. Still, don't see it with anyone you're remotely romantic with because it will certainly dispel the charm. On the other hand, if you are already in a dysfunctional relationship, maybe on the verge of a divorce or breakup, then definitely SEE THIS MOVIE. It can be cathartic, better than any $200/hr marriage therapist. After all, what do you have to lose, you miserable schlep?

The title therefore takes on added significance; can Ellen forget Paris, or will she end up forgetting Mickey? Some reviewers have taken exception to the happy ending, such as James Berardinelli, who accused it of lacking "emotional honesty". Of course, it would have been quite possible to turn the story of Mickey and Ellen into a serious study of a failing marriage, but "Forget Paris" was never intended to be a film of that sort. In my view, a happy ending is the only one possible; an unhappy ending to a romantic comedy would be about as appropriate as a series of strident dissonances at the end of a Mozart symphony. And "Forget Paris" is clearly designed to be comic, not tragic. The two leading actors are very different in their styles of acting. As I stated, Billy Crystal started as a stand-up comedian, and specialises in comedies. (I would find it difficult to imagine him in a serious film). He was, of course, the star of "When Harry Met Sally", one of the best romantic comedies of the eighties. Debra Winger, on the other hand, is not an actress I would normally have associated with comedy. In early films such as "Cannery Row" or "An Officer and a Gentleman" she played attractive, vivacious characters, but she later became a rather intense actress, at her best in serious dramas like "Betrayed", "Shadowlands", "Black Widow" or "A Dangerous Woman". I never cared for that lugubrious romantic tragedy "Terms of Endearment", but the fact that Winger won a "Best Actress" Oscar suggests that a lot of other people liked it. The point of casting two such dissimilar actors may have been to emphasise the contrast in character between Mickey and Ellen, a contrast that would have been lessened if Ellen had been played by an experienced romantic comedy actress such as Meg Ryan, Crystal's co-star in "When Harry Met Sally". Winger's performance here suggests that she is not perhaps the world's most naturally gifted comedienne, but she still makes an endearing, if rather earnest, heroine. The difficulties in the Gordons' marriage may stem from the fact that Ellen is a fundamentally more serious person than Mickey, except perhaps where basketball is concerned. (Even the name Mickey, with its associations with Mickey Mouse and "taking the mickey", suggests someone less serious than a Michael or even a Mike). Crystal is very funny in this film, and most of the best lines go to him, although there are also some good contributions from the assembled diners. ("Marriages don't work when one partner is happy and the other is miserable. Marriage is about both people being equally miserable"- that one could be straight out of Woody Allen). There are also some great set pieces, such as the scene in the fertility clinic and the one where Ellen gets a pigeon stuck to her head. Overall, this is an amusing and likable romantic comedy. 7/10

    Billy Crystal was his normal funny self, evoking a number of laughs in here BUT, lest you think this is a comedy, it's more of a drama....much more. I say that because much of this shows a courtship and a marriage. The courtship is romantic and cute, of course, but the marriage are not. Things don't work out between Crystal's "Mickey Gordon-" and Debra Winger's "Ellen" and many of the scenes with them arguing are not fun to watch. It fact, some are downright uncomfortable. I'm not a fan of Winger's low and raspy voice, nor seeing marriages crumble. Thus, my favorite parts of this film were all in the beginning, especially when "Mickey" was an NBA referee. A few basketball stars got a chance to act, too, showing they should stick with sports. Crystal is a big sports fan so I'm sure enjoyed that segment of the movie. Also commendable are the nice shots of Paris. I never get tired of looking at that city, no matter what film.

    Mickey Gordon is a basketball referee who travels to France to bury his father. Ellen Andrews is living in Paris, and works for the airline he flies with. They meet and fall in love, but their relationship goes through many difficult patches. Their love life is told in flashback by their friends at a restaurant waiting for them to arrive.... Written and directed by Crystal, you'd be forgiven if you'd think it was a vanity project, but he did that two years earlier, this is sort of a reheated version of 'when Harry Met sally' and whilst it never hits the heights of that movie, it's still a classy movie. it's so easy going and laid back, you forgive Crystal for the gags that showcase him, or the incidental music that just goes for your heartstrings at the correct points, or the fact that it gets a little bit too smug for it's own good when we are at the table with the support. it's because crystal knows how to grab the audience and keep them hooked until the end. I know it's no the best movie out there, but it's charming and the cast are brilliant in a 'we've known each other forever' kind of way. Funny stuff, Crystal is a brilliant writer

    For starters, who casts Billy Crystal as a leading man in a romantic love story? Who can believe that any woman would be attracted to him enough to move from Paris to be with him? Another annoying thing is the story being told by a bunch of other barely believable characters. Except for occasional brilliant comedic one-liners, there is nothing redeeming about this film at all. All attempts at creating plot twists fall flat because there are no plot twists, only uninteresting turns that do not really make the movie any more interesting. Verdict? Stay away from this G*d awful movie. These are the 90 or so minutes you will never get back.

    This is possibly the worst date movie since "I Spit on Your Grave". But I loved it. As only the charmingly cynical Billy Crystal can give us, this is the story of what happens AFTER "happily ever after". It exposes all the warts & blemishes & dirty socks that plague an average dysfunctional couple but does it in a funny way that never feels upsetting, disturbing or depressing. Still, don't see it with anyone you're remotely romantic with because it will certainly dispel the charm. On the other hand, if you are already in a dysfunctional relationship, maybe on the verge of a divorce or breakup, then definitely SEE THIS MOVIE. It can be cathartic, better than any $200/hr marriage therapist. After all, what do you have to lose, you miserable schlep? Told in an interesting, non-linear, "Citizen Kane" way (i.e. told in flashback through the subjective interpretations of different characters), it carries a mounting sense of mystery and suspense that keeps you guessing until the very end. That's what separates it from the standard dysfunctional rom-com (romance on the Orient Express?). Agatha Christie would be proud. Where this movie falls slightly short, and the reason why I'm docking it a few stars, is the chemistry between Billy Crystal and Debra Winger. Though both fine actors, I never found them convincing as a couple, not the way we saw with Billy Crystal & Meg Ryan a few years earlier in "When Harry Met Sally". But sheesh, nothing will ever touch that movie, it was so perfect. "Forget Paris" is a great movie to watch and remind yourself that love isn't always Valentine's Day & rose-covered mattresses. But love can still be an interesting ride. It's hard to think of many other films that achieve this. But maybe I'd compare it to "War of the Roses", "Singles" and the classic Kim Novak/Dean Martin flick "Kiss Me, Stupid".

    Forget Paris (Billy Crystal, 1995) is a rather chilly examination of how tricky it can be to forge a happy marriage, with a few cartoonish episodes chucked in alongside. Billy Crystal does his usual schtick as he romances Debra Winger, though the structure is pure Woody Allen - the whole film told by a group of friends at a party - and the foreign funeral set-up half-inched somewhat obviously from Billy Wilder's underrated Avanti!. The result is somewhat unsatisfactory. It's certainly no Moonstruck or Broadway Danny Rose, but it's not even When Harry Met Sally - and the Paris-set sections were disappointingly brief considering I'd just returned from my travels and was secretly hankering for a glossily-photographed sight-seeing tour. There are comic compensations, though. Playing a basketball referee, Crystal's meltdown on the court is the obvious highlight - along with his senile father-in-law's fondness for regurgitating ad slogans. "You asked for it... you got it. Toyota. You asked for it... you got it. Toyota. You asked for it... you got it. Toyota."

    "Forget Paris" is a feel-good romantic comedy about the on again off again relationship between Mickey (Billy Crystal, who also directed, produced and was one of the writers), an NBA referee, and Ellen (Debra Winger), a customer relations trouble shooter for an airline. Friends of sports writer Andy (Joe Mantegna) are gathering at a restaurant to be introduced to Liz (Cynthia Stevenson) before their wedding. Liz comments that how she and Andy met must be the oddest ever (a fax had one digit off in the fax number and went to Andy by mistake). Andy says no, how Mickey met Ellen is the weirdest. They met because she helped him bury his father. That starts the friends telling the story of Mickey and Ellen. Some critics consider this way of telling the story and the plot stale and schmaltzy; but it is so well done that I could care less. The film genre is romantic comedy; this film's strength is the comedy part of that term. I could give examples but comedy is best when the punchline (or its visual equivalent) is unexpected. Let me just say that one of my favorite bits starts with the focus on an organist going through the motions of preparing to play serious music. Billy Crystal is known to be a serious basketball fan and in part the film is like a documentary about refereeing NBA games, with a huge number of basketball stars playing themselves. I was bemused at the end of the credits when the standard disclaimer came up saying that all the characters and names in the film were fictitious. Not hardly in this film. I should mention that Cynthia Stevenson's hysterically tearful performance as Liz listening to Mickey's and Ellen's highs and lows was great. I also loved the sound track. Ella Fitzgerald singing "April in Paris" is so great; also, Billy Holiday doing the opening "Our Love Is Here To Stay." David Sanborn's saxophone version of the "Star Spangled Banner" is also particularly great. My one quibble is that I found Debra Winger's voice very sexy in 1982's "Officer and a Gentleman" and she didn't sound the same in 1995's "Forget Paris." I probably don't sound the same as I did 13 years ago either.

    This movie was always on the top of my waiting list because I just really like romantic American movies that happen in my country. But right now, I receive it more personally than ever! For me too, an unforgettable story has been born on the banks of the Seine (more the VII district for me). So it's really moving (and fun) to share Crystal/Winger romance blooming. It's a sort of "What If". For sure, after the fireworks of the meeting, comes the harsh reality that can threaten it! From that moment, the movie turns feeble because the Crystal character is too egomaniac. For me, the best definition for "Love" is when you can forget yourself, and for that instance, Crystal is very deficient and it appears like a totally different person he was in Paris: he doesn't want to quit his job, he doesn't speak to her father At the same time, Winger shows a lot of compassion and faces great pain for her femininity! It's just too big to be true But, the story is told with a nice gimmick (the memories from their close friends), it has really funny quotes.

    Is there a specific reason why Crystal has not directed more often? I'm feeling like starting a petition and sending a copy of this to anyone who would potentially sign it. He, Mantegna, Kavner(the three reasons I gave it the much-deserved chance), Winger and Stevenson are fantastic. Their performances and the timing, spot-on. This is incredibly funny, in the clever, dry, not trying too hard kind of way. The humor does have a few gross moments, however, apart from that, it's all hilarious, if you're into the sarcastic, at times cynical, type of material. Hardly any gags or jokes fall flat, throughout it. It's well-acted, and the characters are good. In addition, it's highly involving, and you find yourself caring, not just laughing, during this. Part of the emotion comes from the honesty of this, that it isn't your usual romantic comedy of "boy who looks like a male model meets female lead who appears to have stepped right off the train from Glamourville", and so on and so forth. This has ups *and* downs, and goes beyond the superficial level of the Hollywood pap that we all know, without forgetting what genre of film it is. The story is imaginative and holds surprises. The writing is top-notch. Do note that this is not for kids, the rating the MPAA gave it makes sense. There is language and themes herein. I recommend this to any fan of anyone who was part of creating it, Billy in particular. 7/10

    This movie can't quite make up its mind as to what it wants to be, romantic comedy, light drama, slapstick, story of a modern marriage. Couple 'meet cute' in Paris. Debra Winger (Ellen) and Billy Crystal (Mickey) seem like a natural fit. One liner blitzfest, some funny. They get married after a few bumps and a few unrealistic plot contrivances. Then the story of the marriage as viewed through the eyes of Mickey's friends. The films gets seriously dramatic then with infertility problems, career problems, elderly father moving in. Some parts are brilliant - the elderly father particularly, and Mickey throwing his weight around with the twice-as-tall basketball players. Some parts are flat - the sperm rush to the hospital, the marriage counselling. The supporting cast add some value but the movie is all Billy doing his Harry redux from "When Harry Met Sally." It fell a little too flat for me. 6 out of 10.

    "Forget Paris" is on some ways reminiscent of the work of Woody Allen. Billy Crystal is, like Allen, a diminutive New Yorker who started as a stand-up comic before moving into acting, and his character in this film, Mickey Gordon, has something in common with Woody's self-deprecating creations. The story of Mickey and his wife, Ellen, is told in a series of flashbacks by a group of acquaintances over a meal in a restaurant; Allen had used a similar technique in his "Broadway Danny Rose" and was to do so again in "Melinda and Melinda", although in that film the stories told were invented ones. Mickey meets Ellen when he flies to France to bury his father, who has expressed the wish to be buried with his old Army comrades who were killed during the war. On arrival in Paris, however, Mickey finds that his father's coffin has been lost. Ellen is the airline official responsible for helping him find it. That sounds like the opening for a zany, screwball-type comedy or a macabre black comedy, but "Forget Paris" is neither. It is rather a romantic comedy with a difference. Most rom-coms are about courtship, and end with the marriage or engagement of the couple concerned. This one is as much about what comes after marriage as with what leads up to it; the marriage of Mickey and Ellen comes less than halfway through. After the missing coffin is found, Mickey and Ellen have a whirlwind romance in Paris, leading to their marriage and to her leaving her job in Paris to return with him to America. Paris in American films is typically the city of love and romance; one of these, "An American in Paris", is referred to a number of times. Mickey even sings one of the songs from that film, "Our Love is Here to Stay". The title, "Forget Paris", a phrase used a number of times in the course of their marriage, therefore becomes shorthand for "We've got to put the courtship phase of our relationship behind us and move on to dealing with the problems of married life together". And Mickey and Ellen have plenty of problems. They are unable to have children, and their relationship is put under stress by their contrasting lifestyles. Ellen, cultured and sophisticated, would prefer to live in Paris, but reluctantly agrees to return to America. Mickey is a basketball referee, which means that he spends much of the time travelling around America, leaving Ellen at home. She tries to persuade him to quit his job so that they can spend more time together, and this leads to quarrels between them. Further strain is caused by the arrival of Ellen's irritating elderly father Arthur. Eventually they separate, and Ellen returns to Paris. The title therefore takes on added significance; can Ellen forget Paris, or will she end up forgetting Mickey? Some reviewers have taken exception to the happy ending, such as James Berardinelli, who accused it of lacking "emotional honesty". Of course, it would have been quite possible to turn the story of Mickey and Ellen into a serious study of a failing marriage, but "Forget Paris" was never intended to be a film of that sort. In my view, a happy ending is the only one possible; an unhappy ending to a romantic comedy would be about as appropriate as a series of strident dissonances at the end of a Mozart symphony.
