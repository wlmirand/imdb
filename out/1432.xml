    I stumbled upon the book The Mighty as a child. I later found out there was a movie done. I am now 24. As I watched this I obviously reflected on it differently as it has been between 10-15 years since I first saw it. The acting is excellent because you have all imaginable emotions being done. Happiness, sadness, confusion, frustration, anger, rage, desperation, despair, etc. I have friends but no one that I hang out with. No one that I really know inside and out to the point where I could protect them from themselves without feeling nervous about which boundaries I was comfortable with crossing. I could not watch this straight though. I had to watch it in two shots because I could not help from crying. It touches me on that personal of a level. I hope others stumble on this movie and find it similarly if not equally enjoyable. Cheers, Jeremy

    It was a mere accident that I saw this movie. I was just flipping through the channels and just happen to stop at Star Movies. It was the scene where Kevin is introduced as a tutor to Max. I don't know what was it, but I bought the DVD of this movie next day. Kieran is has done an excellent job as a handicap boy. I sincerely feel that he is the one who is actually the sole of the movie. Sharon stone is perfect as a mother. Frankly I was not so impressed by Elden Henson as Max in the first half of the movie. But during the later part of the movie I realized that the movie was actually not focusing on him in the first half. He actually takes all the credit away in the last scene where he runs after the Ambulance and reaches that "medical center" about which Kevin lied. A lot of credit goes to the music of the film, which is the essence of the movie. I usually don't watch drama, but after American Beauty, this is the best I have seen.

    Well, The Mighty was one I first was exposed to one Sunday Afternoon as I had the TV on for background noise. I don't remember how much of it I caught, or my first impression of it, but a year later I moved and started seeing this VHS on the shelf of the library where I now live. I eventually was curious enough to look at the case and figured out it was that movie I'd seen on TV. I rented it... again.. and again.. I just watched it for probably the 5th or 6th time last night. Really, I think this movie touches me more strongly every-time I see it. I was as amazed and bowled over by the sheer emotions and inspiration of it all, just as if it had been my first time watching it. I think a lot of it is due to the young man (also in the Mighty Ducks movies) that plays Max Cane, the large, allegedly slow-witted young man. I think it's his performance, his emotions and his character development that make this such a touching movie. But the other actors are great too. I think Kierran did a great job, despite not having Dwarfism like his character is supposed to have. I think they should have found another condition that cripples and limits lifespan, and said THAT was what Freak had.. because (from what I understand) Moqurio's is a form of Dwarfism, and Kierran doesn't come across that way, despite being thin and not a "big" boy, and their efforts to make him hunchback... Other than that very forgivable "flaw" this movie is definitely FAR superior to Simon Birch, both in story, acting, inspiration, and heart. Definitely check this movie out if you like movies that make you believe in the power of friendship, and it's ability to change your life.

    In the mid 1990s, a streak of coming-of-age flicks were released, each trying to emulate the tone and style of Rob Reiner's "Stand by me" (1986). And so "Stand by Me" led to the TV series "The Wonder Years" (1988), which led to Woody Allen's "Radio Days", "Brighton Beach Memoirs", "Radio Flyer" (1992), "Man in the Moon" (1991), "Jack the Bear" (1993), "This Boys Life" (1993), "King of the Hill", "Now and Then" (1995), "Unsung Heroes" (1995), "The Mighty" (1998), "Simon Birch" (1998) etc etc. These films all employed a rich and romantic visual style which recalled the paintings of Norman Rockwell. They featured older and wiser narrators who reminisced about their childhood days, revolved around small groups of young boys, largely took place in the 60s and early 70s, and oozed a sense of nostalgia. Significantly, all these films also yearned for escape. These kids (or rather their future adult selves) are all searching for a romanticised version of Americana. A forgotten, or perhaps nonexistent, age of white picket fences, carefree wandering, pop sodas and family dinners. Behind all this comfortable nostalgia, though, is a sense of menace. Abuse, suicide, murder, the lingering effects of the Vietnam war and drunken fathers, all linger in the background. Covertly, these films are also implicitly about how early circumstances influence a person's later identity. They're all told from the point of view of an adult, looking back at his past life. This trend started in the 80, by artists who were born post WW2 and became young men in the mid 60s. By the late 90s the "unseen enemy" of these films stopped being about war, poverty, absent fathers, abuse and alcoholism, and started to be about disease and genetic disorders. The idealised Norman Rockwell version of Americana was still there, but now Generation X seemed to obsess over diseases and genetics. For Generation X, misery seemed to be all about ailments and genetic predisposition, like the kids with Morquio's syndrome in "The Mighty" and "Simon Birch" or AIDS in "The Cure". "Stand by Me"- 8/10, "The Mighty"- 7.9/10, "Simon Birch"- 7/10, "The Cure"- 5/10, "Radio Flyer"- 4/10, "Jack the Bear"- 7.5/10, "This boys life"- 8/10, "Now and then"- 3/10, "Man in the moon"- 7.5/10 I think these films are interesting if you treat them as a single batch. Stuff like "Radio Flyer" and "Now and Then" have that whole kitschy Spielberg vibe. They're pretty worthless. The Tom Hanks cheesefest "Radio Flyer" and the Rosie O Donnell travesty "Now and Then" are pretty terrible. "The Mighty's" somewhere in the middle.

    In this instance, the mightiest actors are billed below the supporting "stars": Elden Henson (as Maxwell "Max" Kane) plays a learning disabled young man, who has twice failed the seventh grade; and, Kieran Culkin (as Kevin "Freak" Dillon) plays a chronically crippled boy genius. Mr. Culkin is assigned the unenviable job of tutoring Mr. Henson in reading. A child of unending imagination and unnerving confidence, Culkin begins by teaching Henson about "King Arthur and His Knights". It turns out to be the perfect choice. You should figure out, very quickly, where this film is headed. A couple of the supporting performances are overdone, the spaghetti looks fake, and the border between fantasy and reality seems broken by an almost impossible to believe event. STILL, the film scores highest where it counts: most importantly, Henson and Culkin are outstanding; their relationship, and performances, ring jarringly true. They slay dragons, save maidens, and walk high above the world. Director Peter Chelsom guides the two young actors well, and John de Borman photographs the locations beautifully. Significant supporting players include Sharon Stone, Gena Rowlands, and Harry Dean Stanton. For the record, children like those characterized in Rodman Philbrick's novel "Freak the Mighty" do exist. An excellent film for everyone who is a child. ******** The Mighty (1998) Peter Chelsom ~ Elden Henson, Kieran Culkin, Sharon Stone

    I discovered this movie while on a flight home from Germany. I was so impressed I came home and told everyone I knew to find it and watch it. It is not an easy movie to find but it is so worth the search. We've used it in our youth groups several times over the years. People borrow my DVD all the time to see it again. This movie bombed at the box office, but most critics have said that it failed because it was so poorly advertised. I have to agree. Excellent cast, very good acting, and an great storyline. It is a crying shame this movie was done in by a pitiful advertising campaign. Don't let this one slip you by. Make the effort to find it and watch it. You will not be disappointed. In fact, don't be surprised if you too find yourself adding this one to your library.

    I love this film. It is so great. I think it's much different than most other movies, especially like how it breaks the movie into multiple different titled chapters. I have read the book and it is just brilliant. It's so sad how Freak died at the end and Max was running barefoot into the research center and then just got down and started crying after he found out it was a laundry place. It is a brilliant movie. I did not cry, but there were probably a lot of people who did. I love this movie. I don't know what my favorite part was. I liked the fireworks part when Max picked up Freak and put him on top of his shoulders because Freak had trouble seeing the fireworks. I also liked when Blade and his gang attacked Freak and Max took the manhole cover and used it as a shield. I especially loved when Freak was playing with his chop suey. You really have to see this movie because it is brilliant, great, touching, and you would just love it.

    Less importantly, I can't figure out why Sharon Stone is the number one credit when the story isn't really about her character. Other than that, this movie has good intentions and a great story. However, there were a few scenes that just felt overly tense, such as when--possible spoilers--Kevin begins choking on his food and loses consciousness, as well as the scene where Loretta is strangled (but not killed), which is otherwise understandable. This seemingly is supposed to be a family-friendly film, but with these scenes the filmmakers make it look more like a thriller. If the filmmakers had not done this, I believe this film could very easily have been given a PG rating. -6 stars for the tension.

    We rented THE MIGHTY after doing a JAMES GANDOLFINI search. Big T is in this picture, as is Sharon Stone. Both play excellent supporting roles, but the focus is not on them, but on two kids and the drama of how an overgrown hulk and a smart squirt on crutches team us to overcome the bad guys and be pals for lifetime is exceptional and real. If you like true life stories about real kids --- not Hollywood style smart mouths, it's hard to imagine a better recent film. One of the kids is played by Mccauley Calkin's kid brother and it just brings to mind how "Mack's" real life never-married parents brought 7 kids into the world, apparently raised with no values and bled dry. Mack Calkin had no talent to speak of when he was "luckily" tossed into the "Home Alone" series. With that and Columbia's charmless "My Girl" Mack (or his unmarried child-breeding parents) grabbed up $17 million and Mack was burned out at age 14. Then he gets involved with Michael Jackson; but before that happened the parents are hawking the younger kids trading off Mack's star power. Gag me, please. A $17 million income by age 14 might be nice, but is no guarantee of a full life. Of all the rotten parents in Hollywood, one might be hard pressed to name worse than those of Drew Barrymore, Maccauly Calkin or Winona Ryder. Drew bottomed-out by age 12 and raised herself up on her own mettle; Winona had LSD guru Timothy Leary as a godparent and is still clueless about her shoplifting downfall, then there's the Calkin kids. God help them.

    Every single cast member gives a riveting and moving performance in The Mighty, a beautiful film about the power and strength of friendship and imagination and especially faith. Max is a giant stuck in 7th grade because of his low IQ. He forges a very close friendship with newcomer Kevin, a tiny scientific genius with a severe back deformity. Max protects Kevin from bullies, and Kevin teaches Max about the Knights of the Round Table. With Kevin on Max's shoulders, they go around on adventures and doing good deeds like their heroes, the Knights. My only problem with this film is that I think Sharon Stone gets way too much credit. Don't get me wrong, she does an amazing job. It's just that I don't think her role is that big compared to the rest. Other than that, it's AMAZING!!!!! In the words of another enthusiastic commenter: "Rent it, buy it, SEE IT!!!"

If you like true life stories about real kids --- not Hollywood style smart mouths, it's hard to imagine a better recent film. One of the kids is played by Mccauley Calkin's kid brother and it just brings to mind how "Mack's" real life never-married parents brought 7 kids into the world, apparently raised with no values and bled dry. Mack Calkin had no talent to speak of when he was "luckily" tossed into the "Home Alone" series. With that and Columbia's charmless "My Girl" Mack (or his unmarried child-breeding parents) grabbed up $17 million and Mack was burned out at age 14. Then he gets involved with Michael Jackson; but before that happened the parents are hawking the younger kids trading off Mack's star power. Gag me, please. A $17 million income by age 14 might be nice, but is no guarantee of a full life. Of all the rotten parents in Hollywood, one might be hard pressed to name worse than those of Drew Barrymore, Maccauly Calkin or Winona Ryder. Drew bottomed-out by age 12 and raised herself up on her own mettle; Winona had LSD guru Timothy Leary as a godparent and is still clueless about her shoplifting downfall, then there's the Calkin kids. God help them.

    Every single cast member gives a riveting and moving performance in The Mighty, a beautiful film about the power and strength of friendship and imagination and especially faith. Max is a giant stuck in 7th grade because of his low IQ. He forges a very close friendship with newcomer Kevin, a tiny scientific genius with a severe back deformity. Max protects Kevin from bullies, and Kevin teaches Max about the Knights of the Round Table. With Kevin on Max's shoulders, they go around on adventures and doing good deeds like their heroes, the Knights. My only problem with this film is that I think Sharon Stone gets way too much credit. Don't get me wrong, she does an amazing job. It's just that I don't think her role is that big compared to the rest. Other than that, it's AMAZING!!!!! In the words of another enthusiastic commenter: "Rent it, buy it, SEE IT!!!"

    I stumbled upon the book The Mighty as a child. I later found out there was a movie done. I am now 24. As I watched this I obviously reflected on it differently as it has been between 10-15 years since I first saw it. The acting is excellent because you have all imaginable emotions being done. Happiness, sadness, confusion, frustration, anger, rage, desperation, despair, etc. I have friends but no one that I hang out with. No one that I really know inside and out to the point where I could protect them from themselves without feeling nervous about which boundaries I was comfortable with crossing. I could not watch this straight though. I had to watch it in two shots because I could not help from crying. It touches me on that personal of a level. I hope others stumble on this movie and find it similarly if not equally enjoyable. Cheers, Jeremy

    It was a mere accident that I saw this movie. I was just flipping through the channels and just happen to stop at Star Movies. It was the scene where Kevin is introduced as a tutor to Max. I don't know what was it, but I bought the DVD of this movie next day. Kieran is has done an excellent job as a handicap boy. I sincerely feel that he is the one who is actually the sole of the movie. Sharon stone is perfect as a mother. Frankly I was not so impressed by Elden Henson as Max in the first half of the movie. But during the later part of the movie I realized that the movie was actually not focusing on him in the first half. He actually takes all the credit away in the last scene where he runs after the Ambulance and reaches that "medical center" about which Kevin lied. A lot of credit goes to the music of the film, which is the essence of the movie. I usually don't watch drama, but after American Beauty, this is the best I have seen.

    Well, The Mighty was one I first was exposed to one Sunday Afternoon as I had the TV on for background noise. I don't remember how much of it I caught, or my first impression of it, but a year later I moved and started seeing this VHS on the shelf of the library where I now live. I eventually was curious enough to look at the case and figured out it was that movie I'd seen on TV. I rented it... again.. and again.. I just watched it for probably the 5th or 6th time last night. Really, I think this movie touches me more strongly every-time I see it. I was as amazed and bowled over by the sheer emotions and inspiration of it all, just as if it had been my first time watching it. I think a lot of it is due to the young man (also in the Mighty Ducks movies) that plays Max Cane, the large, allegedly slow-witted young man. I think it's his performance, his emotions and his character development that make this such a touching movie. But the other actors are great too. I think Kierran did a great job, despite not having Dwarfism like his character is supposed to have. I think they should have found another condition that cripples and limits lifespan, and said THAT was what Freak had.. because (from what I understand) Moqurio's is a form of Dwarfism, and Kierran doesn't come across that way, despite being thin and not a "big" boy, and their efforts to make him hunchback... Other than that very forgivable "flaw" this movie is definitely FAR superior to Simon Birch, both in story, acting, inspiration, and heart. Definitely check this movie out if you like movies that make you believe in the power of friendship, and it's ability to change your life.

    In the mid 1990s, a streak of coming-of-age flicks were released, each trying to emulate the tone and style of Rob Reiner's "Stand by me" (1986). And so "Stand by Me" led to the TV series "The Wonder Years" (1988), which led to Woody Allen's "Radio Days", "Brighton Beach Memoirs", "Radio Flyer" (1992), "Man in the Moon" (1991), "Jack the Bear" (1993), "This Boys Life" (1993), "King of the Hill", "Now and Then" (1995), "Unsung Heroes" (1995), "The Mighty" (1998), "Simon Birch" (1998) etc etc. These films all employed a rich and romantic visual style which recalled the paintings of Norman Rockwell. They featured older and wiser narrators who reminisced about their childhood days, revolved around small groups of young boys, largely took place in the 60s and early 70s, and oozed a sense of nostalgia. Significantly, all these films also yearned for escape. These kids (or rather their future adult selves) are all searching for a romanticised version of Americana. A forgotten, or perhaps nonexistent, age of white picket fences, carefree wandering, pop sodas and family dinners. Behind all this comfortable nostalgia, though, is a sense of menace. Abuse, suicide, murder, the lingering effects of the Vietnam war and drunken fathers, all linger in the background. Covertly, these films are also implicitly about how early circumstances influence a person's later identity. They're all told from the point of view of an adult, looking back at his past life. This trend started in the 80, by artists who were born post WW2 and became young men in the mid 60s. By the late 90s the "unseen enemy" of these films stopped being about war, poverty, absent fathers, abuse and alcoholism, and started to be about disease and genetic disorders. The idealised Norman Rockwell version of Americana was still there, but now Generation X seemed to obsess over diseases and genetics. For Generation X, misery seemed to be all about ailments and genetic predisposition, like the kids with Morquio's syndrome in "The Mighty" and "Simon Birch" or AIDS in "The Cure". "Stand by Me"- 8/10, "The Mighty"- 7.9/10, "Simon Birch"- 7/10, "The Cure"- 5/10, "Radio Flyer"- 4/10, "Jack the Bear"- 7.5/10, "This boys life"- 8/10, "Now and then"- 3/10, "Man in the moon"- 7.5/10 I think these films are interesting if you treat them as a single batch. Stuff like "Radio Flyer" and "Now and Then" have that whole kitschy Spielberg vibe. They're pretty worthless. The Tom Hanks cheesefest "Radio Flyer" and the Rosie O Donnell travesty "Now and Then" are pretty terrible. "The Mighty's" somewhere in the middle.

    In this instance, the mightiest actors are billed below the supporting "stars": Elden Henson (as Maxwell "Max" Kane) plays a learning disabled young man, who has twice failed the seventh grade; and, Kieran Culkin (as Kevin "Freak" Dillon) plays a chronically crippled boy genius. Mr. Culkin is assigned the unenviable job of tutoring Mr. Henson in reading. A child of unending imagination and unnerving confidence, Culkin begins by teaching Henson about "King Arthur and His Knights". It turns out to be the perfect choice. You should figure out, very quickly, where this film is headed. A couple of the supporting performances are overdone, the spaghetti looks fake, and the border between fantasy and reality seems broken by an almost impossible to believe event. STILL, the film scores highest where it counts: most importantly, Henson and Culkin are outstanding; their relationship, and performances, ring jarringly true. They slay dragons, save maidens, and walk high above the world. Director Peter Chelsom guides the two young actors well, and John de Borman photographs the locations beautifully. Significant supporting players include Sharon Stone, Gena Rowlands, and Harry Dean Stanton. For the record, children like those characterized in Rodman Philbrick's novel "Freak the Mighty" do exist. An excellent film for everyone who is a child. ******** The Mighty (1998) Peter Chelsom ~ Elden Henson, Kieran Culkin, Sharon Stone

    I discovered this movie while on a flight home from Germany. I was so impressed I came home and told everyone I knew to find it and watch it. It is not an easy movie to find but it is so worth the search. We've used it in our youth groups several times over the years. People borrow my DVD all the time to see it again. This movie bombed at the box office, but most critics have said that it failed because it was so poorly advertised. I have to agree. Excellent cast, very good acting, and an great storyline. It is a crying shame this movie was done in by a pitiful advertising campaign. Don't let this one slip you by. Make the effort to find it and watch it. You will not be disappointed. In fact, don't be surprised if you too find yourself adding this one to your library.

    I love this film. It is so great. I think it's much different than most other movies, especially like how it breaks the movie into multiple different titled chapters. I have read the book and it is just brilliant. It's so sad how Freak died at the end and Max was running barefoot into the research center and then just got down and started crying after he found out it was a laundry place. It is a brilliant movie. I did not cry, but there were probably a lot of people who did. I love this movie. I don't know what my favorite part was. I liked the fireworks part when Max picked up Freak and put him on top of his shoulders because Freak had trouble seeing the fireworks. I also liked when Blade and his gang attacked Freak and Max took the manhole cover and used it as a shield. I especially loved when Freak was playing with his chop suey. You really have to see this movie because it is brilliant, great, touching, and you would just love it.

    Less importantly, I can't figure out why Sharon Stone is the number one credit when the story isn't really about her character. Other than that, this movie has good intentions and a great story. However, there were a few scenes that just felt overly tense, such as when--possible spoilers--Kevin begins choking on his food and loses consciousness, as well as the scene where Loretta is strangled (but not killed), which is otherwise understandable. This seemingly is supposed to be a family-friendly film, but with these scenes the filmmakers make it look more like a thriller. If the filmmakers had not done this, I believe this film could very easily have been given a PG rating. -6 stars for the tension.

    We rented THE MIGHTY after doing a JAMES GANDOLFINI search. Big T is in this picture, as is Sharon Stone. Both play excellent supporting roles, but the focus is not on them, but on two kids and the drama of how an overgrown hulk and a smart squirt on crutches team us to overcome the bad guys and be pals for lifetime is exceptional and real. If you like true life stories about real kids --- not Hollywood style smart mouths, it's hard to imagine a better recent film. One of the kids is played by Mccauley Calkin's kid brother and it just brings to mind how "Mack's" real life never-married parents brought 7 kids into the world, apparently raised with no values and bled dry. Mack Calkin had no talent to speak of when he was "luckily" tossed into the "Home Alone" series. With that and Columbia's charmless "My Girl" Mack (or his unmarried child-breeding parents) grabbed up $17 million and Mack was burned out at age 14. Then he gets involved with Michael Jackson; but before that happened the parents are hawking the younger kids trading off Mack's star power. Gag me, please. A $17 million income by age 14 might be nice, but is no guarantee of a full life. Of all the rotten parents in Hollywood, one might be hard pressed to name worse than those of Drew Barrymore, Maccauly Calkin or Winona Ryder. Drew bottomed-out by age 12 and raised herself up on her own mettle; Winona had LSD guru Timothy Leary as a godparent and is still clueless about her shoplifting downfall, then there's the Calkin kids. God help them.

    Every single cast member gives a riveting and moving performance in The Mighty, a beautiful film about the power and strength of friendship and imagination and especially faith. Max is a giant stuck in 7th grade because of his low IQ. He forges a very close friendship with newcomer Kevin, a tiny scientific genius with a severe back deformity. Max protects Kevin from bullies, and Kevin teaches Max about the Knights of the Round Table. With Kevin on Max's shoulders, they go around on adventures and doing good deeds like their heroes, the Knights. My only problem with this film is that I think Sharon Stone gets way too much credit. Don't get me wrong, she does an amazing job. It's just that I don't think her role is that big compared to the rest. Other than that, it's AMAZING!!!!! In the words of another enthusiastic commenter: "Rent it, buy it, SEE IT!!!"

    I stumbled upon the book The Mighty as a child. I later found out there was a movie done. I am now 24. As I watched this I obviously reflected on it differently as it has been between 10-15 years since I first saw it. The acting is excellent because you have all imaginable emotions being done. Happiness, sadness, confusion, frustration, anger, rage, desperation, despair, etc. I have friends but no one that I hang out with. No one that I really know inside and out to the point where I could protect them from themselves without feeling nervous about which boundaries I was comfortable with crossing. I could not watch this straight though. I had to watch it in two shots because I could not help from crying. It touches me on that personal of a level. I hope others stumble on this movie and find it similarly if not equally enjoyable. Cheers, Jeremy

    It was a mere accident that I saw this movie. I was just flipping through the channels and just happen to stop at Star Movies. It was the scene where Kevin is introduced as a tutor to Max. I don't know what was it, but I bought the DVD of this movie next day. Kieran is has done an excellent job as a handicap boy. I sincerely feel that he is the one who is actually the sole of the movie. Sharon stone is perfect as a mother. Frankly I was not so impressed by Elden Henson as Max in the first half of the movie. But during the later part of the movie I realized that the movie was actually not focusing on him in the first half. He actually takes all the credit away in the last scene where he runs after the Ambulance and reaches that "medical center" about which Kevin lied. A lot of credit goes to the music of the film, which is the essence of the movie. I usually don't watch drama, but after American Beauty, this is the best I have seen.

    Well, The Mighty was one I first was exposed to one Sunday Afternoon as I had the TV on for background noise. I don't remember how much of it I caught, or my first impression of it, but a year later I moved and started seeing this VHS on the shelf of the library where I now live. I eventually was curious enough to look at the case and figured out it was that movie I'd seen on TV. I rented it... again.. and again.. I just watched it for probably the 5th or 6th time last night. Really, I think this movie touches me more strongly every-time I see it. I was as amazed and bowled over by the sheer emotions and inspiration of it all, just as if it had been my first time watching it. I think a lot of it is due to the young man (also in the Mighty Ducks movies) that plays Max Cane, the large, allegedly slow-witted young man. I think it's his performance, his emotions and his character development that make this such a touching movie. But the other actors are great too. I think Kierran did a great job, despite not having Dwarfism like his character is supposed to have. I think they should have found another condition that cripples and limits lifespan, and said THAT was what Freak had.. because (from what I understand) Moqurio's is a form of Dwarfism, and Kierran doesn't come across that way, despite being thin and not a "big" boy, and their efforts to make him hunchback... Other than that very forgivable "flaw" this movie is definitely FAR superior to Simon Birch, both in story, acting, inspiration, and heart. Definitely check this movie out if you like movies that make you believe in the power of friendship, and it's ability to change your life.

    In the mid 1990s, a streak of coming-of-age flicks were released, each trying to emulate the tone and style of Rob Reiner's "Stand by me" (1986). And so "Stand by Me" led to the TV series "The Wonder Years" (1988), which led to Woody Allen's "Radio Days", "Brighton Beach Memoirs", "Radio Flyer" (1992), "Man in the Moon" (1991), "Jack the Bear" (1993), "This Boys Life" (1993), "King of the Hill", "Now and Then" (1995), "Unsung Heroes" (1995), "The Mighty" (1998), "Simon Birch" (1998) etc etc. These films all employed a rich and romantic visual style which recalled the paintings of Norman Rockwell. They featured older and wiser narrators who reminisced about their childhood days, revolved around small groups of young boys, largely took place in the 60s and early 70s, and oozed a sense of nostalgia. Significantly, all these films also yearned for escape. These kids (or rather their future adult selves) are all searching for a romanticised version of Americana. A forgotten, or perhaps nonexistent, age of white picket fences, carefree wandering, pop sodas and family dinners. Behind all this comfortable nostalgia, though, is a sense of menace. Abuse, suicide, murder, the lingering effects of the Vietnam war and drunken fathers, all linger in the background. Covertly, these films are also implicitly about how early circumstances influence a person's later identity. They're all told from the point of view of an adult, looking back at his past life. This trend started in the 80, by artists who were born post WW2 and became young men in the mid 60s. By the late 90s the "unseen enemy" of these films stopped being about war, poverty, absent fathers, abuse and alcoholism, and started to be about disease and genetic disorders. The idealised Norman Rockwell version of Americana was still there, but now Generation X seemed to obsess over diseases and genetics. For Generation X, misery seemed to be all about ailments and genetic predisposition, like the kids with Morquio's syndrome in "The Mighty" and "Simon Birch" or AIDS in "The Cure". "Stand by Me"- 8/10, "The Mighty"- 7.9/10, "Simon Birch"- 7/10, "The Cure"- 5/10, "Radio Flyer"- 4/10, "Jack the Bear"- 7.5/10, "This boys life"- 8/10, "Now and then"- 3/10, "Man in the moon"- 7.5/10 I think these films are interesting if you treat them as a single batch. Stuff like "Radio Flyer" and "Now and Then" have that whole kitschy Spielberg vibe. They're pretty worthless. The Tom Hanks cheesefest "Radio Flyer" and the Rosie O Donnell travesty "Now and Then" are pretty terrible. "The Mighty's" somewhere in the middle.

    In this instance, the mightiest actors are billed below the supporting "stars": Elden Henson (as Maxwell "Max" Kane) plays a learning disabled young man, who has twice failed the seventh grade; and, Kieran Culkin (as Kevin "Freak" Dillon) plays a chronically crippled boy genius. Mr. Culkin is assigned the unenviable job of tutoring Mr. Henson in reading. A child of unending imagination and unnerving confidence, Culkin begins by teaching Henson about "King Arthur and His Knights". It turns out to be the perfect choice. You should figure out, very quickly, where this film is headed. A couple of the supporting performances are overdone, the spaghetti looks fake, and the border between fantasy and reality seems broken by an almost impossible to believe event. STILL, the film scores highest where it counts: most importantly, Henson and Culkin are outstanding; their relationship, and performances, ring jarringly true. They slay dragons, save maidens, and walk high above the world. Director Peter Chelsom guides the two young actors well, and John de Borman photographs the locations beautifully. Significant supporting players include Sharon Stone, Gena Rowlands, and Harry Dean Stanton. For the record, children like those characterized in Rodman Philbrick's novel "Freak the Mighty" do exist. An excellent film for everyone who is a child. ******** The Mighty (1998) Peter Chelsom ~ Elden Henson, Kieran Culkin, Sharon Stone

    I discovered this movie while on a flight home from Germany. I was so impressed I came home and told everyone I knew to find it and watch it. It is not an easy movie to find but it is so worth the search. We've used it in our youth groups several times over the years. People borrow my DVD all the time to see it again. This movie bombed at the box office, but most critics have said that it failed because it was so poorly advertised. I have to agree. Excellent cast, very good acting, and an great storyline. It is a crying shame this movie was done in by a pitiful advertising campaign. Don't let this one slip you by. Make the effort to find it and watch it. You will not be disappointed. In fact, don't be surprised if you too find yourself adding this one to your library.

    I love this film. It is so great. I think it's much different than most other movies, especially like how it breaks the movie into multiple different titled chapters. I have read the book and it is just brilliant. It's so sad how Freak died at the end and Max was running barefoot into the research center and then just got down and started crying after he found out it was a laundry place. It is a brilliant movie. I did not cry, but there were probably a lot of people who did. I love this movie. I don't know what my favorite part was. I liked the fireworks part when Max picked up Freak and put him on top of his shoulders because Freak had trouble seeing the fireworks. I also liked when Blade and his gang attacked Freak and Max took the manhole cover and used it as a shield. I especially loved when Freak was playing with his chop suey. You really have to see this movie because it is brilliant, great, touching, and you would just love it.

    Less importantly, I can't figure out why Sharon Stone is the number one credit when the story isn't really about her character. Other than that, this movie has good intentions and a great story. However, there were a few scenes that just felt overly tense, such as when--possible spoilers--Kevin begins choking on his food and loses consciousness, as well as the scene where Loretta is strangled (but not killed), which is otherwise understandable. This seemingly is supposed to be a family-friendly film, but with these scenes the filmmakers make it look more like a thriller. If the filmmakers had not done this, I believe this film could very easily have been given a PG rating. -6 stars for the tension.

    We rented THE MIGHTY after doing a JAMES GANDOLFINI search. Big T is in this picture, as is Sharon Stone. Both play excellent supporting roles, but the focus is not on them, but on two kids and the drama of how an overgrown hulk and a smart squirt on crutches team us to overcome the bad guys and be pals for lifetime is exceptional and real. If you like true life stories about real kids --- not Hollywood style smart mouths, it's hard to imagine a better recent film. One of the kids is played by Mccauley Calkin's kid brother and it just brings to mind how "Mack's" real life never-married parents brought 7 kids into the world, apparently raised with no values and bled dry. Mack Calkin had no talent to speak of when he was "luckily" tossed into the "Home Alone" series. With that and Columbia's charmless "My Girl" Mack (or his unmarried child-breeding parents) grabbed up $17 million and Mack was burned out at age 14. Then he gets involved with Michael Jackson; but before that happened the parents are hawking the younger kids trading off Mack's star power. Gag me, please. A $17 million income by age 14 might be nice, but is no guarantee of a full life. Of all the rotten parents in Hollywood, one might be hard pressed to name worse than those of Drew Barrymore, Maccauly Calkin or Winona Ryder. Drew bottomed-out by age 12 and raised herself up on her own mettle; Winona had LSD guru Timothy Leary as a godparent and is still clueless about her shoplifting downfall, then there's the Calkin kids. God help them.

    Every single cast member gives a riveting and moving performance in The Mighty, a beautiful film about the power and strength of friendship and imagination and especially faith. Max is a giant stuck in 7th grade because of his low IQ. He forges a very close friendship with newcomer Kevin, a tiny scientific genius with a severe back deformity. Max protects Kevin from bullies, and Kevin teaches Max about the Knights of the Round Table. With Kevin on Max's shoulders, they go around on adventures and doing good deeds like their heroes, the Knights. My only problem with this film is that I think Sharon Stone gets way too much credit. Don't get me wrong, she does an amazing job. It's just that I don't think her role is that big compared to the rest. Other than that, it's AMAZING!!!!! In the words of another enthusiastic commenter: "Rent it, buy it, SEE IT!!!"

    I stumbled upon the book The Mighty as a child. I later found out there was a movie done. I am now 24. As I watched this I obviously reflected on it differently as it has been between 10-15 years since I first saw it. The acting is excellent because you have all imaginable emotions being done. Happiness, sadness, confusion, frustration, anger, rage, desperation, despair, etc. I have friends but no one that I hang out with. No one that I really know inside and out to the point where I could protect them from themselves without feeling nervous about which boundaries I was comfortable with crossing. I could not watch this straight though. I had to watch it in two shots because I could not help from crying. It touches me on that personal of a level. I hope others stumble on this movie and find it similarly if not equally enjoyable. Cheers, Jeremy

    It was a mere accident that I saw this movie. I was just flipping through the channels and just happen to stop at Star Movies. It was the scene where Kevin is introduced as a tutor to Max. I don't know what was it, but I bought the DVD of this movie next day. Kieran is has done an excellent job as a handicap boy. I sincerely feel that he is the one who is actually the sole of the movie. Sharon stone is perfect as a mother. Frankly I was not so impressed by Elden Henson as Max in the first half of the movie. But during the later part of the movie I realized that the movie was actually not focusing on him in the first half. He actually takes all the credit away in the last scene where he runs after the Ambulance and reaches that "medical center" about which Kevin lied. A lot of credit goes to the music of the film, which is the essence of the movie. I usually don't watch drama, but after American Beauty, this is the best I have seen.

    Well, The Mighty was one I first was exposed to one Sunday Afternoon as I had the TV on for background noise. I don't remember how much of it I caught, or my first impression of it, but a year later I moved and started seeing this VHS on the shelf of the library where I now live. I eventually was curious enough to look at the case and figured out it was that movie I'd seen on TV. I rented it... again.. and again.. I just watched it for probably the 5th or 6th time last night. Really, I think this movie touches me more strongly every-time I see it. I was as amazed and bowled over by the sheer emotions and inspiration of it all, just as if it had been my first time watching it. I think a lot of it is due to the young man (also in the Mighty Ducks movies) that plays Max Cane, the large, allegedly slow-witted young man. I think it's his performance, his emotions and his character development that make this such a touching movie. But the other actors are great too. I think Kierran did a great job, despite not having Dwarfism like his character is supposed to have. I think they should have found another condition that cripples and limits lifespan, and said THAT was what Freak had.. because (from what I understand) Moqurio's is a form of Dwarfism, and Kierran doesn't come across that way, despite being thin and not a "big" boy, and their efforts to make him hunchback... Other than that very forgivable "flaw" this movie is definitely FAR superior to Simon Birch, both in story, acting, inspiration, and heart. Definitely check this movie out if you like movies that make you believe in the power of friendship, and it's ability to change your life.

    In the mid 1990s, a streak of coming-of-age flicks were released, each trying to emulate the tone and style of Rob Reiner's "Stand by me" (1986). And so "Stand by Me" led to the TV series "The Wonder Years" (1988), which led to Woody Allen's "Radio Days", "Brighton Beach Memoirs", "Radio Flyer" (1992), "Man in the Moon" (1991), "Jack the Bear" (1993), "This Boys Life" (1993), "King of the Hill", "Now and Then" (1995), "Unsung Heroes" (1995), "The Mighty" (1998), "Simon Birch" (1998) etc etc. These films all employed a rich and romantic visual style which recalled the paintings of Norman Rockwell. They featured older and wiser narrators who reminisced about their childhood days, revolved around small groups of young boys, largely took place in the 60s and early 70s, and oozed a sense of nostalgia. Significantly, all these films also yearned for escape. These kids (or rather their future adult selves) are all searching for a romanticised version of Americana. A forgotten, or perhaps nonexistent, age of white picket fences, carefree wandering, pop sodas and family dinners. Behind all this comfortable nostalgia, though, is a sense of menace. Abuse, suicide, murder, the lingering effects of the Vietnam war and drunken fathers, all linger in the background. Covertly, these films are also implicitly about how early circumstances influence a person's later identity. They're all told from the point of view of an adult, looking back at his past life. This trend started in the 80, by artists who were born post WW2 and became young men in the mid 60s. By the late 90s the "unseen enemy" of these films stopped being about war, poverty, absent fathers, abuse and alcoholism, and started to be about disease and genetic disorders. The idealised Norman Rockwell version of Americana was still there, but now Generation X seemed to obsess over diseases and genetics. For Generation X, misery seemed to be all about ailments and genetic predisposition, like the kids with Morquio's syndrome in "The Mighty" and "Simon Birch" or AIDS in "The Cure". "Stand by Me"- 8/10, "The Mighty"- 7.9/10, "Simon Birch"- 7/10, "The Cure"- 5/10, "Radio Flyer"- 4/10, "Jack the Bear"- 7.5/10, "This boys life"- 8/10, "Now and then"- 3/10, "Man in the moon"- 7.5/10 I think these films are interesting if you treat them as a single batch. Stuff like "Radio Flyer" and "Now and Then" have that whole kitschy Spielberg vibe. They're pretty worthless. The Tom Hanks cheesefest "Radio Flyer" and the Rosie O Donnell travesty "Now and Then" are pretty terrible. "The Mighty's" somewhere in the middle.

    In this instance, the mightiest actors are billed below the supporting "stars": Elden Henson (as Maxwell "Max" Kane) plays a learning disabled young man, who has twice failed the seventh grade; and, Kieran Culkin (as Kevin "Freak" Dillon) plays a chronically crippled boy genius. Mr. Culkin is assigned the unenviable job of tutoring Mr. Henson in reading. A child of unending imagination and unnerving confidence, Culkin begins by teaching Henson about "King Arthur and His Knights". It turns out to be the perfect choice. You should figure out, very quickly, where this film is headed. A couple of the supporting performances are overdone, the spaghetti looks fake, and the border between fantasy and reality seems broken by an almost impossible to believe event. STILL, the film scores highest where it counts: most importantly, Henson and Culkin are outstanding; their relationship, and performances, ring jarringly true. They slay dragons, save maidens, and walk high above the world. Director Peter Chelsom guides the two young actors well, and John de Borman photographs the locations beautifully. Significant supporting players include Sharon Stone, Gena Rowlands, and Harry Dean Stanton. For the record, children like those characterized in Rodman Philbrick's novel "Freak the Mighty" do exist. An excellent film for everyone who is a child. ******** The Mighty (1998) Peter Chelsom ~ Elden Henson, Kieran Culkin, Sharon Stone

    I discovered this movie while on a flight home from Germany. I was so impressed I came home and told everyone I knew to find it and watch it. It is not an easy movie to find but it is so worth the search. We've used it in our youth groups several times over the years. People borrow my DVD all the time to see it again. This movie bombed at the box office, but most critics have said that it failed because it was so poorly advertised. I have to agree. Excellent cast, very good acting, and an great storyline. It is a crying shame this movie was done in by a pitiful advertising campaign. Don't let this one slip you by. Make the effort to find it and watch it. You will not be disappointed. In fact, don't be surprised if you too find yourself adding this one to your library.

    I love this film. It is so great. I think it's much different than most other movies, especially like how it breaks the movie into multiple different titled chapters. I have read the book and it is just brilliant. It's so sad how Freak died at the end and Max was running barefoot into the research center and then just got down and started crying after he found out it was a laundry place. It is a brilliant movie. I did not cry, but there were probably a lot of people who did. I love this movie. I don't know what my favorite part was. I liked the fireworks part when Max picked up Freak and put him on top of his shoulders because Freak had trouble seeing the fireworks. I also liked when Blade and his gang attacked Freak and Max took the manhole cover and used it as a shield. I especially loved when Freak was playing with his chop suey. You really have to see this movie because it is brilliant, great, touching, and you would just love it.

    Less importantly, I can't figure out why Sharon Stone is the number one credit when the story isn't really about her character. Other than that, this movie has good intentions and a great story. However, there were a few scenes that just felt overly tense, such as when--possible spoilers--Kevin begins choking on his food and loses consciousness, as well as the scene where Loretta is strangled (but not killed), which is otherwise understandable. This seemingly is supposed to be a family-friendly film, but with these scenes the filmmakers make it look more like a thriller. If the filmmakers had not done this, I believe this film could very easily have been given a PG rating. -6 stars for the tension.

    We rented THE MIGHTY after doing a JAMES GANDOLFINI search. Big T is in this picture, as is Sharon Stone. Both play excellent supporting roles, but the focus is not on them, but on two kids and the drama of how an overgrown hulk and a smart squirt on crutches team us to overcome the bad guys and be pals for lifetime is exceptional and real. If you like true life stories about real kids --- not Hollywood style smart mouths, it's hard to imagine a better recent film. One of the kids is played by Mccauley Calkin's kid brother and it just brings to mind how "Mack's" real life never-married parents brought 7 kids into the world, apparently raised with no values and bled dry. Mack Calkin had no talent to speak of when he was "luckily" tossed into the "Home Alone" series. With that and Columbia's charmless "My Girl" Mack (or his unmarried child-breeding parents) grabbed up $17 million and Mack was burned out at age 14. Then he gets involved with Michael Jackson; but before that happened the parents are hawking the younger kids trading off Mack's star power. Gag me, please. A $17 million income by age 14 might be nice, but is no guarantee of a full life. Of all the rotten parents in Hollywood, one might be hard pressed to name worse than those of Drew Barrymore, Maccauly Calkin or Winona Ryder. Drew bottomed-out by age 12 and raised herself up on her own mettle; Winona had LSD guru Timothy Leary as a godparent and is still clueless about her shoplifting downfall, then there's the Calkin kids. God help them.

    Every single cast member gives a riveting and moving performance in The Mighty, a beautiful film about the power and strength of friendship and imagination and especially faith. Max is a giant stuck in 7th grade because of his low IQ. He forges a very close friendship with newcomer Kevin, a tiny scientific genius with a severe back deformity. Max protects Kevin from bullies, and Kevin teaches Max about the Knights of the Round Table. With Kevin on Max's shoulders, they go around on adventures and doing good deeds like their heroes, the Knights. My only problem with this film is that I think Sharon Stone gets way too much credit. Don't get me wrong, she does an amazing job. It's just that I don't think her role is that big compared to the rest. Other than that, it's AMAZING!!!!! In the words of another enthusiastic commenter: "Rent it, buy it, SEE IT!!!"

    I stumbled upon the book The Mighty as a child. I later found out there was a movie done. I am now 24. As I watched this I obviously reflected on it differently as it has been between 10-15 years since I first saw it. The acting is excellent because you have all imaginable emotions being done. Happiness, sadness, confusion, frustration, anger, rage, desperation, despair, etc. I have friends but no one that I hang out with. No one that I really know inside and out to the point where I could protect them from themselves without feeling nervous about which boundaries I was comfortable with crossing. I could not watch this straight though. I had to watch it in two shots because I could not help from crying. It touches me on that personal of a level. I hope others stumble on this movie and find it similarly if not equally enjoyable. Cheers, Jeremy

    It was a mere accident that I saw this movie. I was just flipping through the channels and just happen to stop at Star Movies. It was the scene where Kevin is introduced as a tutor to Max. I don't know what was it, but I bought the DVD of this movie next day. Kieran is has done an excellent job as a handicap boy. I sincerely feel that he is the one who is actually the sole of the movie. Sharon stone is perfect as a mother. Frankly I was not so impressed by Elden Henson as Max in the first half of the movie. But during the later part of the movie I realized that the movie was actually not focusing on him in the first half. He actually takes all the credit away in the last scene where he runs after the Ambulance and reaches that "medical center" about which Kevin lied. A lot of credit goes to the music of the film, which is the essence of the movie. I usually don't watch drama, but after American Beauty, this is the best I have seen.

    Well, The Mighty was one I first was exposed to one Sunday Afternoon as I had the TV on for background noise. I don't remember how much of it I caught, or my first impression of it, but a year later I moved and started seeing this VHS on the shelf of the library where I now live. I eventually was curious enough to look at the case and figured out it was that movie I'd seen on TV. I rented it... again.. and again.. I just watched it for probably the 5th or 6th time last night. Really, I think this movie touches me more strongly every-time I see it. I was as amazed and bowled over by the sheer emotions and inspiration of it all, just as if it had been my first time watching it. I think a lot of it is due to the young man (also in the Mighty Ducks movies) that plays Max Cane, the large, allegedly slow-witted young man. I think it's his performance, his emotions and his character development that make this such a touching movie. But the other actors are great too. I think Kierran did a great job, despite not having Dwarfism like his character is supposed to have. I think they should have found another condition that cripples and limits lifespan, and said THAT was what Freak had.. because (from what I understand) Moqurio's is a form of Dwarfism, and Kierran doesn't come across that way, despite being thin and not a "big" boy, and their efforts to make him hunchback... Other than that very forgivable "flaw" this movie is definitely FAR superior to Simon Birch, both in story, acting, inspiration, and heart. Definitely check this movie out if you like movies that make you believe in the power of friendship, and it's ability to change your life.

    In the mid 1990s, a streak of coming-of-age flicks were released, each trying to emulate the tone and style of Rob Reiner's "Stand by me" (1986). And so "Stand by Me" led to the TV series "The Wonder Years" (1988), which led to Woody Allen's "Radio Days", "Brighton Beach Memoirs", "Radio Flyer" (1992), "Man in the Moon" (1991), "Jack the Bear" (1993), "This Boys Life" (1993), "King of the Hill", "Now and Then" (1995), "Unsung Heroes" (1995), "The Mighty" (1998), "Simon Birch" (1998) etc etc. These films all employed a rich and romantic visual style which recalled the paintings of Norman Rockwell. They featured older and wiser narrators who reminisced about their childhood days, revolved around small groups of young boys, largely took place in the 60s and early 70s, and oozed a sense of nostalgia. Significantly, all these films also yearned for escape. These kids (or rather their future adult selves) are all searching for a romanticised version of Americana. A forgotten, or perhaps nonexistent, age of white picket fences, carefree wandering, pop sodas and family dinners. Behind all this comfortable nostalgia, though, is a sense of menace. Abuse, suicide, murder, the lingering effects of the Vietnam war and drunken fathers, all linger in the background. Covertly, these films are also implicitly about how early circumstances influence a person's later identity. They're all told from the point of view of an adult, looking back at his past life. This trend started in the 80, by artists who were born post WW2 and became young men in the mid 60s. By the late 90s the "unseen enemy" of these films stopped being about war, poverty, absent fathers, abuse and alcoholism, and started to be about disease and genetic disorders. The idealised Norman Rockwell version of Americana was still there, but now Generation X seemed to obsess over diseases and genetics. For Generation X, misery seemed to be all about ailments and genetic predisposition, like the kids with Morquio's syndrome in "The Mighty" and "Simon Birch" or AIDS in "The Cure". "Stand by Me"- 8/10, "The Mighty"- 7.9/10, "Simon Birch"- 7/10, "The Cure"- 5/10, "Radio Flyer"- 4/10, "Jack the Bear"- 7.5/10, "This boys life"- 8/10, "Now and then"- 3/10, "Man in the moon"- 7.5/10 I think these films are interesting if you treat them as a single batch. Stuff like "Radio Flyer" and "Now and Then" have that whole kitschy Spielberg vibe. They're pretty worthless. The Tom Hanks cheesefest "Radio Flyer" and the Rosie O Donnell travesty "Now and Then" are pretty terrible. "The Mighty's" somewhere in the middle.

    In this instance, the mightiest actors are billed below the supporting "stars": Elden Henson (as Maxwell "Max" Kane) plays a learning disabled young man, who has twice failed the seventh grade; and, Kieran Culkin (as Kevin "Freak" Dillon) plays a chronically crippled boy genius. Mr. Culkin is assigned the unenviable job of tutoring Mr. Henson in reading. A child of unending imagination and unnerving confidence, Culkin begins by teaching Henson about "King Arthur and His Knights". It turns out to be the perfect choice. You should figure out, very quickly, where this film is headed. A couple of the supporting performances are overdone, the spaghetti looks fake, and the border between fantasy and reality seems broken by an almost impossible to believe event. STILL, the film scores highest where it counts: most importantly, Henson and Culkin are outstanding; their relationship, and performances, ring jarringly true. They slay dragons, save maidens, and walk high above the world. Director Peter Chelsom guides the two young actors well, and John de Borman photographs the locations beautifully. Significant supporting players include Sharon Stone, Gena Rowlands, and Harry Dean Stanton. For the record, children like those characterized in Rodman Philbrick's novel "Freak the Mighty" do exist. An excellent film for everyone who is a child. ******** The Mighty (1998) Peter Chelsom ~ Elden Henson, Kieran Culkin, Sharon Stone

    I discovered this movie while on a flight home from Germany. I was so impressed I came home and told everyone I knew to find it and watch it. It is not an easy movie to find but it is so worth the search. We've used it in our youth groups several times over the years. People borrow my DVD all the time to see it again. This movie bombed at the box office, but most critics have said that it failed because it was so poorly advertised. I have to agree. Excellent cast, very good acting, and an great storyline. It is a crying shame this movie was done in by a pitiful advertising campaign. Don't let this one slip you by. Make the effort to find it and watch it. You will not be disappointed. In fact, don't be surprised if you too find yourself adding this one to your library.

    I love this film. It is so great. I think it's much different than most other movies, especially like how it breaks the movie into multiple different titled chapters. I have read the book and it is just brilliant. It's so sad how Freak died at the end and Max was running barefoot into the research center and then just got down and started crying after he found out it was a laundry place. It is a brilliant movie. I did not cry, but there were probably a lot of people who did. I love this movie. I don't know what my favorite part was. I liked the fireworks part when Max picked up Freak and put him on top of his shoulders because Freak had trouble seeing the fireworks. I also liked when Blade and his gang attacked Freak and Max took the manhole cover and used it as a shield. I especially loved when Freak was playing with his chop suey. You really have to see this movie because it is brilliant, great, touching, and you would just love it.

    Less importantly, I can't figure out why Sharon Stone is the number one credit when the story isn't really about her character. Other than that, this movie has good intentions and a great story. However, there were a few scenes that just felt overly tense, such as when--possible spoilers--Kevin begins choking on his food and loses consciousness, as well as the scene where Loretta is strangled (but not killed), which is otherwise understandable. This seemingly is supposed to be a family-friendly film, but with these scenes the filmmakers make it look more like a thriller. If the filmmakers had not done this, I believe this film could very easily have been given a PG rating. -6 stars for the tension.

    We rented THE MIGHTY after doing a JAMES GANDOLFINI search. Big T is in this picture, as is Sharon Stone. Both play excellent supporting roles, but the focus is not on them, but on two kids and the drama of how an overgrown hulk and a smart squirt on crutches team us to overcome the bad guys and be pals for lifetime is exceptional and real. If you like true life stories about real kids --- not Hollywood style smart mouths, it's hard to imagine a better recent film. One of the kids is played by Mccauley Calkin's kid brother and it just brings to mind how "Mack's" real life never-married parents brought 7 kids into the world, apparently raised with no values and bled dry. Mack Calkin had no talent to speak of when he was "luckily" tossed into the "Home Alone" series. With that and Columbia's charmless "My Girl" Mack (or his unmarried child-breeding parents) grabbed up $17 million and Mack was burned out at age 14. Then he gets involved with Michael Jackson; but before that happened the parents are hawking the younger kids trading off Mack's star power. Gag me, please. A $17 million income by age 14 might be nice, but is no guarantee of a full life. Of all the rotten parents in Hollywood, one might be hard pressed to name worse than those of Drew Barrymore, Maccauly Calkin or Winona Ryder. Drew bottomed-out by age 12 and raised herself up on her own mettle; Winona had LSD guru Timothy Leary as a godparent and is still clueless about her shoplifting downfall, then there's the Calkin kids. God help them.

    There have been very few films that have made me cry. This one made me weep.

    Every single cast member gives a riveting and moving performance in The Mighty, a beautiful film about the power and strength of friendship and imagination and especially faith. Max is a giant stuck in 7th grade because of his low IQ. He forges a very close friendship with newcomer Kevin, a tiny scientific genius with a severe back deformity. Max protects Kevin from bullies, and Kevin teaches Max about the Knights of the Round Table. With Kevin on Max's shoulders, they go around on adventures and doing good deeds like their heroes, the Knights. My only problem with this film is that I think Sharon Stone gets way too much credit. Don't get me wrong, she does an amazing job. It's just that I don't think her role is that big compared to the rest. Other than that, it's AMAZING!!!!! In the words of another enthusiastic commenter: "Rent it, buy it, SEE IT!!!"
