 <sinopse>
  The dimwitted teen duo of Beavis and Butt-Head travel across America in search of their stolen television set.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Our intrepid adolescent heroes wake up to find their beloved television stolen, and embark on an epic journey across America to recover it, and, who knows, maybe even score. On the way they encounter a murderous smuggler of a deadly virus and his treacherous wife, an FBI agent with a predilection for cavity searches, a couple of rather familiar looking ex-Motley Crue roadies, Mr. Van Dreesen singing "Lesbian Seagull", a little old lady and of course Mr. Anderson and his trailer. Can the Great Cornholio save the day? Uh-huh. Huh-huh.

    Scoring with chicks obsesses Beavis and Butthead in director Mike Judge's first feature-length animated opus "Beavis & Butthead Do America," a rude but occasionally clever, cartoon farce that ridicules those two trendy, booger picking, adolescent slackers. Although I've seen my share of their television shenanigans, I haven't kept abreast of their obnoxious antics the way some of my friends have, so I tagged along with two Beavis and Butthead connoisseurs. My B & B fans felt "Beavis & Butthead Do America" was the equivalent of a greatest hits album of their clowning around on the tube. Aside from a surprise or two, Beavis and Butthead are just as nauseating on the big screen as they are on the small one. They did feel that "Do America" was a great way to introduce these reptilian life-forms to silver screen spectators. "Beavis & Butthead Do America" opens with two amusing sequences. The first spoofs "King Kong" with giant-sized versions of our lame-brained protagonists stomping helter-skelter though a miniature city while tanks and helicopters blast away at them. The sketchy animation looks pretty good on the big screen, too. In the second sequence, Isaac Hayes provides the lyrics to the hilarious title sequence that sends up the old ABC-TV undercover, law & order series "Starsky and Hutch," with our characters dresses up as the two heroic cops. Neither sequence has much to do with the other or the story in general, but the sequences are fun, and the film lurches off to a colorful start with them. The screenplay by "Beavis & Butthead" creator Mike Judge follows our protagonists across the United States. Thieves have stolen Beavis & Butthead's television set, and the kids set out to find them. Instead, they meet a thug called Muddy (voice of Bruce Willis) who promises them a small fortune if they will kill his wife. Of course, when our sex-starved idiots agree to "do" his wife, they make the mistake of thinking that Muddy means for them to engage in sexual relations with her. Ironically, the two thieves who pinched Beavis & Butthead's TV were supposed to carry out the hit for Muddy. Once this mistaken-identity plot gets underway, Federal Agents with the Department of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms appear like storm troopers for justice. They pursue Beavis and Butthead on a cross-country chase because they believe that the guys are terrorists with a horrible biological bomb. In an inspired bit of voice casting, "Untouchables" star Robert Stack provides the voice for their fascist nemesis. He resolves to capture the guys, and he forces anybody whose had contact with them to submit to deep cavity searches. Stack's voice is perfect because he plays the part with such deadpan sobriety. Other cute bits include Butthead's visit to the White House where he hits on Chelsea Clinton. Chelsea dumps him unceremoniously out the window in an act of defenestration. Later, the boys visit with President Clinton. He makes them honorary ATF agents. Another funny scene has Beavis and Butthead dismissing the geyser "Old Faithful" because they call it boring, only to be dazzled by urinals in a nearby toilet that flush when a light sensor is activated. Probably the only surprise in the entire comic film is their trek through the desert where they meet two scumbag bikers who turn out to be none other than their fathers. Undeniably, just as Beavis and Butthead is an acquired taste, so is this very crude comedy. The boys have changed little since their tube days. Beavis picks his nose constantly and repeatedly sings his bunghole song. The boys resemble the Trix rabbit in the cereal commercial because they never get what they want. The only characters from the TV series that drop in for appearances are Mr. Anderson, their hippie teacher, and their school principal. You won't see Mr. Buzzcut, Daria, or Stewart. If you enjoyed Beavis & Butthead on MTV, "Beavis & Butthead Do America" should make you chuckle often throughout its brisk 81-minute running time. If numbers are anything to go by, the $50 million plus that "Beavis & Butthead Do America" has grossed (pun intended!) at the box office thus far should guarantee a sequel.

    Animated MTV characters Beavis and Butt-Head made their feature film debut with this very funny movie that actually does a good job of sustaining itself for 81 minutes, with a pretty good story and plenty of the kind of humour that us B & B fans love so much. It's gleefully lowbrow stuff, and that's just the way we like it. Our favourite antisocial horn dog teenagers wake to discover that the most important item in their lives, their TV set, has been stolen, and their search leads them to a shady character named Muddy (voiced by Bruce Willis). Muddy offers them $10,000 to do his wife Dallas (voice of Demi Moore), and B & B readily accept after misinterpreting the word "do". They become embroiled in an elaborate plot to steal a powerful biological weapon, all while following the quintessential B & B agenda: trying to score! B & B's assorted adventures include making life miserable for cranky old neighbor Tom Anderson, causing havoc at places such as the Hoover Dam, the appearance of the legendary Cornholio (who, of course, just needs TP for his bunghole), encountering two very familiar looking former Motley Crue roadies, hallucinating in the desert, and having some eventful plane and bus rides. (It's just so priceless that B & B, upon seeing that they'll be on a bus full of nuns, can't see past the fact that their fellow passengers are chicks.) The colourful cast of characters also includes Agent Flemming (in an inspired bit of casting, Robert Stack voices this part), an ATF agent obsessed with cavity searches. Cloris Leachman plays the aged "slut" on the plane & bus, and Eric Bogosian, Richard Linklater, and David Letterman (billing himself as Earl Hofert) round out the various pop culture figures supplying voices. And everything is set to a kick ass soundtrack that begins with a "Shaft" style number co-written by Isaac Hayes and B & B creator Mike Judge. Other artists heard include the Red Hot Chili Peppers, White Zombie (Rob Zombie also supplies the artwork for the hallucination sequence), AC/DC, Rancid, LL Cool J, Ozzy Osbourne, and Butthole Surfers. If you're a fan of the TV series, you're sure to enjoy "Beavis & Butt-Head Do America". It's extremely agreeable from start to finish, and doesn't overstay its welcome. It delivers more laughs than a lot of live-action comedies. Eight out of 10.

    I got this fantastic film for My Birthday (Exactly 2 Months Ago!) and I have seen it about three times now! This film starts off with MTV's favorite dumb duo who set out on an adventure to America to find their lost TV! (They hope to "Score" along the way!) The film has a lot of very funny double entendr&eacute;s, as well as a lot of vulgar sexual references! This movie had me laughing a lot of the way! It may not have the political satire that the classic film: "South Park: Bigger, Longer And Uncut!" has, but the jokes in the film are still extremely laughable! The film ends with A Fictional Bill Clinton (It is a shame that The Real Bill Clinton himself didn't do the voice!) congratulating Beavis And Butthead for stopping America's Most Wanted Criminals! Before the end credits appear, Beavis And Butthead walk home with their found TV explaining the important moral of the story. The film reached my expectations and it was not a disappointment for me! I very highly recommend this movie if you enjoy animated action comedies! Whatever you do, don't show it to your youngest children! XD Overall Rating: 9/10!

    I saw this movie just the other week and I've gotta say it's one of the best animated comedies ever made. The movie starts out with Beavis (Mike Judge) shaking Butt-Head (Mike Judge) to wake him up from a dream where he was trying to "score," to tell him that their TV has been stolen (completely oblivious to the broken window, crowbar, and footprints leading out the door). Finally, Butt-Head says, "Beavis! I think I've figured something out." Then after a few seconds, he says, "This sucks. It sucks more than anything that's ever sucked before." On a search for a new TV, the brain-dead duo meet Muddy Grimes (Bruce Willis) at a motel, who sends them to do his wife Dallas (Demi Moore) for $10,000. They meet up with her, and she plants a virus in Beavis' pants. The ATF go on a countrywide manhunt for Beavis and Butt-Head, who go across the country hoping to score. Like many of Mike Judge's works (like Office Space), there's a lot of quotable lines (Heh-heh, fire; He said "extend"), and some hilarious scenes (the humping vultures, the acid trip, both "great Cornholio" parts), and many other amazing qualities. 10/10 (Did this movie just score?)

    It's an all-out laugh-fest as Beavis and Butt-Head embark on a quest to get their TV back and, who knows, maybe even score! Uhuh huh huh. From start to finish, this movie is hilarious with all the classic antics the two idiots pull off while new elements are brought into the film. It still has some of the original characters like Mr. Vandreson and the mumbling principal while bringing in all new characters to get some chuckles out of. With wonderful jokes and stars like Bruce Willis, Demi Moore, and Robert Stack, Beavis and Butt-head Do America will make you laugh so hard you'll need two extra pairs of underwear! Go see this movie and hail the great Cornholio. Hehhehhehheh.

    Beavis and Butthead was one of the many points in my childhood where I knew, I was unlike anybody else. I was entertained beyond belief by these two dimwits who knew nothing in the world outside of their couch and their television. Seeing this movie young, most likely around ten, I honestly didn't like it. I found it to be "boring" and I hated how Beavis and Butthead left the town of Highland and ventured out into the big world. I watched it a year later and went on to like it. This is my third viewing. Now I can fully appreciate it. I understood all the jokes, but at the same time I wished the film took place in the town of Highland, I realize that the creators and the director, respectively, had to create a plot that was very large and made to fit an eighty-five minute run time. Not the usual five to ten minute run time the MTV program was used to. At the time, this movie was the near conclusion to the MTV program that ran for five years. There was rumored to be a sequel for years, and remained in development, but never happened. Fine by me. We got something better. It took fifteen years, but in 2011 it's said that the show will return to MTV with brand new episodes poking fun at music videos and viral videos. I'm skeptical, yet my excitement is through the roof. Beavis and Butthead Do America is about the two adolescents that go in search of their missing television set. Wandering into a motel, they become mistaken by a drunk named Muddy (Willis) as the men he hired to kill his wife. Saying he hired them to "do his wife," the boys believe they are being payed to have sex with Muddy's wife. The boys don't object, but then become labeled the most dangerous men in America by the FBI who are in search of a mysterious chip they call "the unit." The humor isn't as racy as people would expect. It maintains a PG-13 rating, and uses it neutrally. That comes off as one of its flaws, sadly. Like the South Park movie that boasted an R rating with very foul language and sex references, clearly showed what could be on the big screen differs greatly from Comedy Central. With Beavis and Butthead Do America, it does the same thing it would've done if it were a TV movie. Even The Simpson's Movie went a little further than its FOX limits. Still, it's worth it for the pleasure of seeing one of the greatest animated duos on the big screen doing what they do best, nothing. The best thing about the teens is they get in trouble, without even trying to get in trouble. They are a victim of bad timing, but somehow avoid every possible consequence. The FBI agent orders roadblocks, they are in the middle of the desert. They order the Dream America bus to stop, they get on a Nun's bus. My favorite scene is when their "peace'd out" teacher tries to tell them from the bottom of his heart that having no Television actually opens a window of opportunity. He claims people need to realize that we don't need TV to entertain us. After that very near and dear moment, all they pick up is "entert(ain us)." Beavis and Butthead Do America has gotten better with repeated viewings, but is seems it never was "boring." I think being young and dumb, the film didn't sit right with me for the reasons I stated above. After the third time, it was pretty cool. Starring: Mike Judge, Demi Moore, and Bruce Willis. Directed by: Mike Judge.

    I don't think Beavis and Butt Head Do America is quite as good as the wonderful TV show, but as far as a film based on a TV show goes, it is a worthy one and one of the better ones I've seen. It is a little too short and there are one or two scenes in the middle that could have done with a tighter pace. The animation is not quite as good as it is in the show, but it is still good and tries hard to stick to its style. The score is infectious and there is also a killer soundtrack. The characters are fun and likable and the story is funny, clever and well structured. The voices are also great, not just from the leads but also the celebrity voices. But the humour is what drives it, crude, vulgar and yes quite risqu&eacute; it is quite hilarious and sharp. All in all, a worthy film even if the TV show is better. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    I became a Beavis and Butt-head fanatic since it came on MTV, when this movie came out to theaters in 1996, I was thrilled and this movie made me laugh throughout the entire film!!! I was laughing like crazy. The films stars as a voice cast: Mike Judge (Beavis and Butt-head, Tom Anderson, Mr. Van Driessen, Principal McVicker), Bruce Willis (Muddy Grimes), Demi Moore (Dallas Grimes), Robert Stack (ATF Agent Flemming), etc. While awaking from a crazy dream, Beavis and Butt-head soon realize that their TV was stolen from a bunch of thieves, and they were mad, so its them on a journey across America to find their TV, not only that, someone is hold captive of a deadly device that belongs to the FBI, it can be found in Beavis's shorts. While searching for the TV, they stop a motel where Muddy Grimes (voice of Bruce Willis) wants them to get Dallas (voice of Demi Moore) back in relationship, elsewhere, they stop at Tom Anderson's trailer and they screwed up his TV, once they stop at Las Vegas, they found Dallas caught in a terrorist control. Chaos ensues when they mess around with the control panel of the Hoover Dam. While many places to go, they got lost in a desert with two Motley Crue roadies, after that, they nearly die from dehydration until Muddy came up to pick them up to get them to Washington DC. Once they get there, the agents are on the run of the unit. After that's taking care of, Tom Anderson, Muddy and Dallas Grimes were arrested and Beavis and Butt-head saved everybody from total chaos, finally, they found their TV lying on the motel sidewalk. This is classic Mike Judge at it's best, next to King of the Hill, and the movie Office Space. One of the funniest scenes in the movie is the Cornholio scene. I can laugh at that all night long. For a movie based cartoon film, it's 1,000,000 times better than that Spongebob Squarepants garbage. This movie is awesome, you'll laugh like there's no tomorrow. Beavis and Butt-head Do America gets 10 stars.

    This is one of the crappiest movies I've ever seen(although not completed). This "movie" is so crappy and so not-funny it was a pain to watch the hour I endured. I mean, come on... This is just completely boring, and immature, but not immature in a good way. I love cartoons like South Park, The Critic and The Simpsons, but this... the horror of this movie is unspeakable! Fart jokes can to a certain extent be funny, like in South Park and Family Guy, this piece of sh*t doesn't even seem to try. They can just sit there, fart and laugh that extremely annoying laugh, I should commit myself for therapy trying to cope with the terrors of this horrible, horrible "film"! Personally I think 1/10 stars is more than this "movie" deserves.

    After watching a couple of 'Beavis & Butthead' episodes on TV and a bunch on the Net, I instantly became a fan, and this just happened a couple of months ago.Now I really wanted to see the movie and I was unable to get the DVD and thought I would never get it.I eventually found a way.There was a site that I went to and I actually managed to watch the whole movie.What you need to know about Beavis and Butthead is that they're the most stupid duo in the history of animation.Think of Fry from 'Futurama' and Homer from 'The Simpsons' and you get Beavis and Butthead.The next thing you need to know about them is that they're addicted to television.When they find out that their set has been stolen, they go on a cross country adventure that involves a deadly poison, nuns, a man who seems to do a cavity search on any suspect or witness, and a really hot lady who's ex looks an awful like Kurt Russell from 'Death Proof'.All of this just to find their TV.Now what would you do? I'm sure you would do something simple like going to Best Buy and buy a new set instead of being hunted down by the FBI.So now you know that Beavis and Butthead are total idiots, yet their movie turns out almost brilliant.How is this possible? Beavis and Butthead's incredible stupidity makes it nearly impossible for you to take your eyes off of them.They're just that entertaining. As Butthead would say if saw this movie: "Uh-huh-huh.This movie's cool.Uh-huh-huh." Beavis would probably say: "I am the great Cornholio! I need TP for my bunghole!"

    I saw this movie just the other week and I've gotta say it's one of the best animated comedies ever made. The movie starts out with Beavis (Mike Judge) shaking Butt-Head (Mike Judge) to wake him up from a dream where he was trying to "score," to tell him that their TV has been stolen (completely oblivious to the broken window, crowbar, and footprints leading out the door). Finally, Butt-Head says, "Beavis! I think I've figured something out." Then after a few seconds, he says, "This sucks. It sucks more than anything that's ever sucked before." On a search for a new TV, the brain-dead duo meet Muddy Grimes (Bruce Willis) at a motel, who sends them to do his wife Dallas (Demi Moore) for $10,000. They meet up with her, and she plants a virus in Beavis' pants. The ATF go on a countrywide manhunt for Beavis and Butt-Head, who go across the country hoping to score. Like many of Mike Judge's works (like Office Space), there's a lot of quotable lines (Heh-heh, fire; He said "extend"), and some hilarious scenes (the humping vultures, the acid trip, both "great Cornholio" parts), and many other amazing qualities. 10/10 (Did this movie just score?)

    It's an all-out laugh-fest as Beavis and Butt-Head embark on a quest to get their TV back and, who knows, maybe even score! Uhuh huh huh. From start to finish, this movie is hilarious with all the classic antics the two idiots pull off while new elements are brought into the film. It still has some of the original characters like Mr. Vandreson and the mumbling principal while bringing in all new characters to get some chuckles out of. With wonderful jokes and stars like Bruce Willis, Demi Moore, and Robert Stack, Beavis and Butt-head Do America will make you laugh so hard you'll need two extra pairs of underwear! Go see this movie and hail the great Cornholio. Hehhehhehheh.

    Beavis and Butthead was one of the many points in my childhood where I knew, I was unlike anybody else. I was entertained beyond belief by these two dimwits who knew nothing in the world outside of their couch and their television. Seeing this movie young, most likely around ten, I honestly didn't like it. I found it to be "boring" and I hated how Beavis and Butthead left the town of Highland and ventured out into the big world. I watched it a year later and went on to like it. This is my third viewing. Now I can fully appreciate it. I understood all the jokes, but at the same time I wished the film took place in the town of Highland, I realize that the creators and the director, respectively, had to create a plot that was very large and made to fit an eighty-five minute run time. Not the usual five to ten minute run time the MTV program was used to. At the time, this movie was the near conclusion to the MTV program that ran for five years. There was rumored to be a sequel for years, and remained in development, but never happened. Fine by me. We got something better. It took fifteen years, but in 2011 it's said that the show will return to MTV with brand new episodes poking fun at music videos and viral videos. I'm skeptical, yet my excitement is through the roof. Beavis and Butthead Do America is about the two adolescents that go in search of their missing television set. Wandering into a motel, they become mistaken by a drunk named Muddy (Willis) as the men he hired to kill his wife. Saying he hired them to "do his wife," the boys believe they are being payed to have sex with Muddy's wife. The boys don't object, but then become labeled the most dangerous men in America by the FBI who are in search of a mysterious chip they call "the unit." The humor isn't as racy as people would expect. It maintains a PG-13 rating, and uses it neutrally. That comes off as one of its flaws, sadly. Like the South Park movie that boasted an R rating with very foul language and sex references, clearly showed what could be on the big screen differs greatly from Comedy Central. With Beavis and Butthead Do America, it does the same thing it would've done if it were a TV movie. Even The Simpson's Movie went a little further than its FOX limits. Still, it's worth it for the pleasure of seeing one of the greatest animated duos on the big screen doing what they do best, nothing. The best thing about the teens is they get in trouble, without even trying to get in trouble. They are a victim of bad timing, but somehow avoid every possible consequence. The FBI agent orders roadblocks, they are in the middle of the desert. They order the Dream America bus to stop, they get on a Nun's bus. My favorite scene is when their "peace'd out" teacher tries to tell them from the bottom of his heart that having no Television actually opens a window of opportunity. He claims people need to realize that we don't need TV to entertain us. After that very near and dear moment, all they pick up is "entert(ain us)." Beavis and Butthead Do America has gotten better with repeated viewings, but is seems it never was "boring." I think being young and dumb, the film didn't sit right with me for the reasons I stated above. After the third time, it was pretty cool. Starring: Mike Judge, Demi Moore, and Bruce Willis. Directed by: Mike Judge.

    I don't think Beavis and Butt Head Do America is quite as good as the wonderful TV show, but as far as a film based on a TV show goes, it is a worthy one and one of the better ones I've seen. It is a little too short and there are one or two scenes in the middle that could have done with a tighter pace. The animation is not quite as good as it is in the show, but it is still good and tries hard to stick to its style. The score is infectious and there is also a killer soundtrack. The characters are fun and likable and the story is funny, clever and well structured. The voices are also great, not just from the leads but also the celebrity voices. But the humour is what drives it, crude, vulgar and yes quite risqu&eacute; it is quite hilarious and sharp. All in all, a worthy film even if the TV show is better. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    I became a Beavis and Butt-head fanatic since it came on MTV, when this movie came out to theaters in 1996, I was thrilled and this movie made me laugh throughout the entire film!!! I was laughing like crazy. The films stars as a voice cast: Mike Judge (Beavis and Butt-head, Tom Anderson, Mr. Van Driessen, Principal McVicker), Bruce Willis (Muddy Grimes), Demi Moore (Dallas Grimes), Robert Stack (ATF Agent Flemming), etc. While awaking from a crazy dream, Beavis and Butt-head soon realize that their TV was stolen from a bunch of thieves, and they were mad, so its them on a journey across America to find their TV, not only that, someone is hold captive of a deadly device that belongs to the FBI, it can be found in Beavis's shorts. While searching for the TV, they stop a motel where Muddy Grimes (voice of Bruce Willis) wants them to get Dallas (voice of Demi Moore) back in relationship, elsewhere, they stop at Tom Anderson's trailer and they screwed up his TV, once they stop at Las Vegas, they found Dallas caught in a terrorist control. Chaos ensues when they mess around with the control panel of the Hoover Dam. While many places to go, they got lost in a desert with two Motley Crue roadies, after that, they nearly die from dehydration until Muddy came up to pick them up to get them to Washington DC. Once they get there, the agents are on the run of the unit. After that's taking care of, Tom Anderson, Muddy and Dallas Grimes were arrested and Beavis and Butt-head saved everybody from total chaos, finally, they found their TV lying on the motel sidewalk. This is classic Mike Judge at it's best, next to King of the Hill, and the movie Office Space. One of the funniest scenes in the movie is the Cornholio scene. I can laugh at that all night long. For a movie based cartoon film, it's 1,000,000 times better than that Spongebob Squarepants garbage. This movie is awesome, you'll laugh like there's no tomorrow. Beavis and Butt-head Do America gets 10 stars.

    This is one of the crappiest movies I've ever seen(although not completed). This "movie" is so crappy and so not-funny it was a pain to watch the hour I endured. I mean, come on... This is just completely boring, and immature, but not immature in a good way. I love cartoons like South Park, The Critic and The Simpsons, but this... the horror of this movie is unspeakable! Fart jokes can to a certain extent be funny, like in South Park and Family Guy, this piece of sh*t doesn't even seem to try. They can just sit there, fart and laugh that extremely annoying laugh, I should commit myself for therapy trying to cope with the terrors of this horrible, horrible "film"! Personally I think 1/10 stars is more than this "movie" deserves.

    After watching a couple of 'Beavis & Butthead' episodes on TV and a bunch on the Net, I instantly became a fan, and this just happened a couple of months ago.Now I really wanted to see the movie and I was unable to get the DVD and thought I would never get it.I eventually found a way.There was a site that I went to and I actually managed to watch the whole movie.What you need to know about Beavis and Butthead is that they're the most stupid duo in the history of animation.Think of Fry from 'Futurama' and Homer from 'The Simpsons' and you get Beavis and Butthead.The next thing you need to know about them is that they're addicted to television.When they find out that their set has been stolen, they go on a cross country adventure that involves a deadly poison, nuns, a man who seems to do a cavity search on any suspect or witness, and a really hot lady who's ex looks an awful like Kurt Russell from 'Death Proof'.All of this just to find their TV.Now what would you do? I'm sure you would do something simple like going to Best Buy and buy a new set instead of being hunted down by the FBI.So now you know that Beavis and Butthead are total idiots, yet their movie turns out almost brilliant.How is this possible? Beavis and Butthead's incredible stupidity makes it nearly impossible for you to take your eyes off of them.They're just that entertaining. As Butthead would say if saw this movie: "Uh-huh-huh.This movie's cool.Uh-huh-huh." Beavis would probably say: "I am the great Cornholio! I need TP for my bunghole!"

    Scoring with chicks obsesses Beavis and Butthead in director Mike Judge's first feature-length animated opus "Beavis & Butthead Do America," a rude but occasionally clever, cartoon farce that ridicules those two trendy, booger picking, adolescent slackers. Although I've seen my share of their television shenanigans, I haven't kept abreast of their obnoxious antics the way some of my friends have, so I tagged along with two Beavis and Butthead connoisseurs. My B & B fans felt "Beavis & Butthead Do America" was the equivalent of a greatest hits album of their clowning around on the tube. Aside from a surprise or two, Beavis and Butthead are just as nauseating on the big screen as they are on the small one. They did feel that "Do America" was a great way to introduce these reptilian life-forms to silver screen spectators. "Beavis & Butthead Do America" opens with two amusing sequences. The first spoofs "King Kong" with giant-sized versions of our lame-brained protagonists stomping helter-skelter though a miniature city while tanks and helicopters blast away at them. The sketchy animation looks pretty good on the big screen, too. In the second sequence, Isaac Hayes provides the lyrics to the hilarious title sequence that sends up the old ABC-TV undercover, law & order series "Starsky and Hutch," with our characters dresses up as the two heroic cops. Neither sequence has much to do with the other or the story in general, but the sequences are fun, and the film lurches off to a colorful start with them. The screenplay by "Beavis & Butthead" creator Mike Judge follows our protagonists across the United States. Thieves have stolen Beavis & Butthead's television set, and the kids set out to find them. Instead, they meet a thug called Muddy (voice of Bruce Willis) who promises them a small fortune if they will kill his wife. Of course, when our sex-starved idiots agree to "do" his wife, they make the mistake of thinking that Muddy means for them to engage in sexual relations with her. Ironically, the two thieves who pinched Beavis & Butthead's TV were supposed to carry out the hit for Muddy. Once this mistaken-identity plot gets underway, Federal Agents with the Department of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms appear like storm troopers for justice. They pursue Beavis and Butthead on a cross-country chase because they believe that the guys are terrorists with a horrible biological bomb. In an inspired bit of voice casting, "Untouchables" star Robert Stack provides the voice for their fascist nemesis. He resolves to capture the guys, and he forces anybody whose had contact with them to submit to deep cavity searches. Stack's voice is perfect because he plays the part with such deadpan sobriety. Other cute bits include Butthead's visit to the White House where he hits on Chelsea Clinton. Chelsea dumps him unceremoniously out the window in an act of defenestration. Later, the boys visit with President Clinton. He makes them honorary ATF agents. Another funny scene has Beavis and Butthead dismissing the geyser "Old Faithful" because they call it boring, only to be dazzled by urinals in a nearby toilet that flush when a light sensor is activated. Probably the only surprise in the entire comic film is their trek through the desert where they meet two scumbag bikers who turn out to be none other than their fathers. Undeniably, just as Beavis and Butthead is an acquired taste, so is this very crude comedy. The boys have changed little since their tube days. Beavis picks his nose constantly and repeatedly sings his bunghole song. The boys resemble the Trix rabbit in the cereal commercial because they never get what they want. The only characters from the TV series that drop in for appearances are Mr. Anderson, their hippie teacher, and their school principal. You won't see Mr. Buzzcut, Daria, or Stewart. If you enjoyed Beavis & Butthead on MTV, "Beavis & Butthead Do America" should make you chuckle often throughout its brisk 81-minute running time. If numbers are anything to go by, the $50 million plus that "Beavis & Butthead Do America" has grossed (pun intended!) at the box office thus far should guarantee a sequel.

    Animated MTV characters Beavis and Butt-Head made their feature film debut with this very funny movie that actually does a good job of sustaining itself for 81 minutes, with a pretty good story and plenty of the kind of humour that us B & B fans love so much. It's gleefully lowbrow stuff, and that's just the way we like it. Our favourite antisocial horn dog teenagers wake to discover that the most important item in their lives, their TV set, has been stolen, and their search leads them to a shady character named Muddy (voiced by Bruce Willis). Muddy offers them $10,000 to do his wife Dallas (voice of Demi Moore), and B & B readily accept after misinterpreting the word "do". They become embroiled in an elaborate plot to steal a powerful biological weapon, all while following the quintessential B & B agenda: trying to score! B & B's assorted adventures include making life miserable for cranky old neighbor Tom Anderson, causing havoc at places such as the Hoover Dam, the appearance of the legendary Cornholio (who, of course, just needs TP for his bunghole), encountering two very familiar looking former Motley Crue roadies, hallucinating in the desert, and having some eventful plane and bus rides. (It's just so priceless that B & B, upon seeing that they'll be on a bus full of nuns, can't see past the fact that their fellow passengers are chicks.) The colourful cast of characters also includes Agent Flemming (in an inspired bit of casting, Robert Stack voices this part), an ATF agent obsessed with cavity searches. Cloris Leachman plays the aged "slut" on the plane & bus, and Eric Bogosian, Richard Linklater, and David Letterman (billing himself as Earl Hofert) round out the various pop culture figures supplying voices. And everything is set to a kick ass soundtrack that begins with a "Shaft" style number co-written by Isaac Hayes and B & B creator Mike Judge. Other artists heard include the Red Hot Chili Peppers, White Zombie (Rob Zombie also supplies the artwork for the hallucination sequence), AC/DC, Rancid, LL Cool J, Ozzy Osbourne, and Butthole Surfers. If you're a fan of the TV series, you're sure to enjoy "Beavis & Butt-Head Do America". It's extremely agreeable from start to finish, and doesn't overstay its welcome. It delivers more laughs than a lot of live-action comedies. Eight out of 10.

    I got this fantastic film for My Birthday (Exactly 2 Months Ago!) and I have seen it about three times now! This film starts off with MTV's favorite dumb duo who set out on an adventure to America to find their lost TV! (They hope to "Score" along the way!) The film has a lot of very funny double entendr&eacute;s, as well as a lot of vulgar sexual references! This movie had me laughing a lot of the way! It may not have the political satire that the classic film: "South Park: Bigger, Longer And Uncut!" has, but the jokes in the film are still extremely laughable! The film ends with A Fictional Bill Clinton (It is a shame that The Real Bill Clinton himself didn't do the voice!) congratulating Beavis And Butthead for stopping America's Most Wanted Criminals! Before the end credits appear, Beavis And Butthead walk home with their found TV explaining the important moral of the story. The film reached my expectations and it was not a disappointment for me! I very highly recommend this movie if you enjoy animated action comedies! Whatever you do, don't show it to your youngest children! XD Overall Rating: 9/10!

Fart jokes can to a certain extent be funny, like in South Park and Family Guy, this piece of sh*t doesn't even seem to try. They can just sit there, fart and laugh that extremely annoying laugh, I should commit myself for therapy trying to cope with the terrors of this horrible, horrible "film"! Personally I think 1/10 stars is more than this "movie" deserves.

    After watching a couple of 'Beavis & Butthead' episodes on TV and a bunch on the Net, I instantly became a fan, and this just happened a couple of months ago.Now I really wanted to see the movie and I was unable to get the DVD and thought I would never get it.I eventually found a way.There was a site that I went to and I actually managed to watch the whole movie.What you need to know about Beavis and Butthead is that they're the most stupid duo in the history of animation.Think of Fry from 'Futurama' and Homer from 'The Simpsons' and you get Beavis and Butthead.The next thing you need to know about them is that they're addicted to television.When they find out that their set has been stolen, they go on a cross country adventure that involves a deadly poison, nuns, a man who seems to do a cavity search on any suspect or witness, and a really hot lady who's ex looks an awful like Kurt Russell from 'Death Proof'.All of this just to find their TV.Now what would you do? I'm sure you would do something simple like going to Best Buy and buy a new set instead of being hunted down by the FBI.So now you know that Beavis and Butthead are total idiots, yet their movie turns out almost brilliant.How is this possible? Beavis and Butthead's incredible stupidity makes it nearly impossible for you to take your eyes off of them.They're just that entertaining. As Butthead would say if saw this movie: "Uh-huh-huh.This movie's cool.Uh-huh-huh." Beavis would probably say: "I am the great Cornholio! I need TP for my bunghole!"

    Scoring with chicks obsesses Beavis and Butthead in director Mike Judge's first feature-length animated opus "Beavis & Butthead Do America," a rude but occasionally clever, cartoon farce that ridicules those two trendy, booger picking, adolescent slackers. Although I've seen my share of their television shenanigans, I haven't kept abreast of their obnoxious antics the way some of my friends have, so I tagged along with two Beavis and Butthead connoisseurs. My B & B fans felt "Beavis & Butthead Do America" was the equivalent of a greatest hits album of their clowning around on the tube. Aside from a surprise or two, Beavis and Butthead are just as nauseating on the big screen as they are on the small one. They did feel that "Do America" was a great way to introduce these reptilian life-forms to silver screen spectators. "Beavis & Butthead Do America" opens with two amusing sequences. The first spoofs "King Kong" with giant-sized versions of our lame-brained protagonists stomping helter-skelter though a miniature city while tanks and helicopters blast away at them. The sketchy animation looks pretty good on the big screen, too. In the second sequence, Isaac Hayes provides the lyrics to the hilarious title sequence that sends up the old ABC-TV undercover, law & order series "Starsky and Hutch," with our characters dresses up as the two heroic cops. Neither sequence has much to do with the other or the story in general, but the sequences are fun, and the film lurches off to a colorful start with them. The screenplay by "Beavis & Butthead" creator Mike Judge follows our protagonists across the United States. Thieves have stolen Beavis & Butthead's television set, and the kids set out to find them. Instead, they meet a thug called Muddy (voice of Bruce Willis) who promises them a small fortune if they will kill his wife. Of course, when our sex-starved idiots agree to "do" his wife, they make the mistake of thinking that Muddy means for them to engage in sexual relations with her. Ironically, the two thieves who pinched Beavis & Butthead's TV were supposed to carry out the hit for Muddy. Once this mistaken-identity plot gets underway, Federal Agents with the Department of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms appear like storm troopers for justice. They pursue Beavis and Butthead on a cross-country chase because they believe that the guys are terrorists with a horrible biological bomb. In an inspired bit of voice casting, "Untouchables" star Robert Stack provides the voice for their fascist nemesis. He resolves to capture the guys, and he forces anybody whose had contact with them to submit to deep cavity searches. Stack's voice is perfect because he plays the part with such deadpan sobriety. Other cute bits include Butthead's visit to the White House where he hits on Chelsea Clinton. Chelsea dumps him unceremoniously out the window in an act of defenestration. Later, the boys visit with President Clinton. He makes them honorary ATF agents. Another funny scene has Beavis and Butthead dismissing the geyser "Old Faithful" because they call it boring, only to be dazzled by urinals in a nearby toilet that flush when a light sensor is activated. Probably the only surprise in the entire comic film is their trek through the desert where they meet two scumbag bikers who turn out to be none other than their fathers. Undeniably, just as Beavis and Butthead is an acquired taste, so is this very crude comedy. The boys have changed little since their tube days. Beavis picks his nose constantly and repeatedly sings his bunghole song. The boys resemble the Trix rabbit in the cereal commercial because they never get what they want. The only characters from the TV series that drop in for appearances are Mr. Anderson, their hippie teacher, and their school principal. You won't see Mr. Buzzcut, Daria, or Stewart. If you enjoyed Beavis & Butthead on MTV, "Beavis & Butthead Do America" should make you chuckle often throughout its brisk 81-minute running time. If numbers are anything to go by, the $50 million plus that "Beavis & Butthead Do America" has grossed (pun intended!) at the box office thus far should guarantee a sequel.

    Animated MTV characters Beavis and Butt-Head made their feature film debut with this very funny movie that actually does a good job of sustaining itself for 81 minutes, with a pretty good story and plenty of the kind of humour that us B & B fans love so much. It's gleefully lowbrow stuff, and that's just the way we like it. Our favourite antisocial horn dog teenagers wake to discover that the most important item in their lives, their TV set, has been stolen, and their search leads them to a shady character named Muddy (voiced by Bruce Willis). Muddy offers them $10,000 to do his wife Dallas (voice of Demi Moore), and B & B readily accept after misinterpreting the word "do". They become embroiled in an elaborate plot to steal a powerful biological weapon, all while following the quintessential B & B agenda: trying to score! B & B's assorted adventures include making life miserable for cranky old neighbor Tom Anderson, causing havoc at places such as the Hoover Dam, the appearance of the legendary Cornholio (who, of course, just needs TP for his bunghole), encountering two very familiar looking former Motley Crue roadies, hallucinating in the desert, and having some eventful plane and bus rides. (It's just so priceless that B & B, upon seeing that they'll be on a bus full of nuns, can't see past the fact that their fellow passengers are chicks.) The colourful cast of characters also includes Agent Flemming (in an inspired bit of casting, Robert Stack voices this part), an ATF agent obsessed with cavity searches. Cloris Leachman plays the aged "slut" on the plane & bus, and Eric Bogosian, Richard Linklater, and David Letterman (billing himself as Earl Hofert) round out the various pop culture figures supplying voices. And everything is set to a kick ass soundtrack that begins with a "Shaft" style number co-written by Isaac Hayes and B & B creator Mike Judge. Other artists heard include the Red Hot Chili Peppers, White Zombie (Rob Zombie also supplies the artwork for the hallucination sequence), AC/DC, Rancid, LL Cool J, Ozzy Osbourne, and Butthole Surfers. If you're a fan of the TV series, you're sure to enjoy "Beavis & Butt-Head Do America". It's extremely agreeable from start to finish, and doesn't overstay its welcome. It delivers more laughs than a lot of live-action comedies. Eight out of 10.

    I got this fantastic film for My Birthday (Exactly 2 Months Ago!) and I have seen it about three times now! This film starts off with MTV's favorite dumb duo who set out on an adventure to America to find their lost TV! (They hope to "Score" along the way!) The film has a lot of very funny double entendr&eacute;s, as well as a lot of vulgar sexual references! This movie had me laughing a lot of the way! It may not have the political satire that the classic film: "South Park: Bigger, Longer And Uncut!" has, but the jokes in the film are still extremely laughable! The film ends with A Fictional Bill Clinton (It is a shame that The Real Bill Clinton himself didn't do the voice!) congratulating Beavis And Butthead for stopping America's Most Wanted Criminals! Before the end credits appear, Beavis And Butthead walk home with their found TV explaining the important moral of the story. The film reached my expectations and it was not a disappointment for me! I very highly recommend this movie if you enjoy animated action comedies! Whatever you do, don't show it to your youngest children! XD Overall Rating: 9/10!

    I saw this movie just the other week and I've gotta say it's one of the best animated comedies ever made. The movie starts out with Beavis (Mike Judge) shaking Butt-Head (Mike Judge) to wake him up from a dream where he was trying to "score," to tell him that their TV has been stolen (completely oblivious to the broken window, crowbar, and footprints leading out the door). Finally, Butt-Head says, "Beavis! I think I've figured something out." Then after a few seconds, he says, "This sucks. It sucks more than anything that's ever sucked before." On a search for a new TV, the brain-dead duo meet Muddy Grimes (Bruce Willis) at a motel, who sends them to do his wife Dallas (Demi Moore) for $10,000. They meet up with her, and she plants a virus in Beavis' pants. The ATF go on a countrywide manhunt for Beavis and Butt-Head, who go across the country hoping to score. Like many of Mike Judge's works (like Office Space), there's a lot of quotable lines (Heh-heh, fire; He said "extend"), and some hilarious scenes (the humping vultures, the acid trip, both "great Cornholio" parts), and many other amazing qualities. 10/10 (Did this movie just score?)

    It's an all-out laugh-fest as Beavis and Butt-Head embark on a quest to get their TV back and, who knows, maybe even score! Uhuh huh huh. From start to finish, this movie is hilarious with all the classic antics the two idiots pull off while new elements are brought into the film. It still has some of the original characters like Mr. Vandreson and the mumbling principal while bringing in all new characters to get some chuckles out of. With wonderful jokes and stars like Bruce Willis, Demi Moore, and Robert Stack, Beavis and Butt-head Do America will make you laugh so hard you'll need two extra pairs of underwear! Go see this movie and hail the great Cornholio. Hehhehhehheh.

    Beavis and Butthead was one of the many points in my childhood where I knew, I was unlike anybody else. I was entertained beyond belief by these two dimwits who knew nothing in the world outside of their couch and their television. Seeing this movie young, most likely around ten, I honestly didn't like it. I found it to be "boring" and I hated how Beavis and Butthead left the town of Highland and ventured out into the big world. I watched it a year later and went on to like it. This is my third viewing. Now I can fully appreciate it. I understood all the jokes, but at the same time I wished the film took place in the town of Highland, I realize that the creators and the director, respectively, had to create a plot that was very large and made to fit an eighty-five minute run time. Not the usual five to ten minute run time the MTV program was used to. At the time, this movie was the near conclusion to the MTV program that ran for five years. There was rumored to be a sequel for years, and remained in development, but never happened. Fine by me. We got something better. It took fifteen years, but in 2011 it's said that the show will return to MTV with brand new episodes poking fun at music videos and viral videos. I'm skeptical, yet my excitement is through the roof. Beavis and Butthead Do America is about the two adolescents that go in search of their missing television set. Wandering into a motel, they become mistaken by a drunk named Muddy (Willis) as the men he hired to kill his wife. Saying he hired them to "do his wife," the boys believe they are being payed to have sex with Muddy's wife. The boys don't object, but then become labeled the most dangerous men in America by the FBI who are in search of a mysterious chip they call "the unit." The humor isn't as racy as people would expect. It maintains a PG-13 rating, and uses it neutrally. That comes off as one of its flaws, sadly. Like the South Park movie that boasted an R rating with very foul language and sex references, clearly showed what could be on the big screen differs greatly from Comedy Central. With Beavis and Butthead Do America, it does the same thing it would've done if it were a TV movie. Even The Simpson's Movie went a little further than its FOX limits. Still, it's worth it for the pleasure of seeing one of the greatest animated duos on the big screen doing what they do best, nothing. The best thing about the teens is they get in trouble, without even trying to get in trouble. They are a victim of bad timing, but somehow avoid every possible consequence. The FBI agent orders roadblocks, they are in the middle of the desert. They order the Dream America bus to stop, they get on a Nun's bus. My favorite scene is when their "peace'd out" teacher tries to tell them from the bottom of his heart that having no Television actually opens a window of opportunity. He claims people need to realize that we don't need TV to entertain us. After that very near and dear moment, all they pick up is "entert(ain us)." Beavis and Butthead Do America has gotten better with repeated viewings, but is seems it never was "boring." I think being young and dumb, the film didn't sit right with me for the reasons I stated above. After the third time, it was pretty cool. Starring: Mike Judge, Demi Moore, and Bruce Willis. Directed by: Mike Judge.

    I don't think Beavis and Butt Head Do America is quite as good as the wonderful TV show, but as far as a film based on a TV show goes, it is a worthy one and one of the better ones I've seen. It is a little too short and there are one or two scenes in the middle that could have done with a tighter pace. The animation is not quite as good as it is in the show, but it is still good and tries hard to stick to its style. The score is infectious and there is also a killer soundtrack. The characters are fun and likable and the story is funny, clever and well structured. The voices are also great, not just from the leads but also the celebrity voices. But the humour is what drives it, crude, vulgar and yes quite risqu&eacute; it is quite hilarious and sharp. All in all, a worthy film even if the TV show is better. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    I became a Beavis and Butt-head fanatic since it came on MTV, when this movie came out to theaters in 1996, I was thrilled and this movie made me laugh throughout the entire film!!! I was laughing like crazy. The films stars as a voice cast: Mike Judge (Beavis and Butt-head, Tom Anderson, Mr. Van Driessen, Principal McVicker), Bruce Willis (Muddy Grimes), Demi Moore (Dallas Grimes), Robert Stack (ATF Agent Flemming), etc. While awaking from a crazy dream, Beavis and Butt-head soon realize that their TV was stolen from a bunch of thieves, and they were mad, so its them on a journey across America to find their TV, not only that, someone is hold captive of a deadly device that belongs to the FBI, it can be found in Beavis's shorts. While searching for the TV, they stop a motel where Muddy Grimes (voice of Bruce Willis) wants them to get Dallas (voice of Demi Moore) back in relationship, elsewhere, they stop at Tom Anderson's trailer and they screwed up his TV, once they stop at Las Vegas, they found Dallas caught in a terrorist control. Chaos ensues when they mess around with the control panel of the Hoover Dam. While many places to go, they got lost in a desert with two Motley Crue roadies, after that, they nearly die from dehydration until Muddy came up to pick them up to get them to Washington DC. Once they get there, the agents are on the run of the unit. After that's taking care of, Tom Anderson, Muddy and Dallas Grimes were arrested and Beavis and Butt-head saved everybody from total chaos, finally, they found their TV lying on the motel sidewalk. This is classic Mike Judge at it's best, next to King of the Hill, and the movie Office Space. One of the funniest scenes in the movie is the Cornholio scene. I can laugh at that all night long. For a movie based cartoon film, it's 1,000,000 times better than that Spongebob Squarepants garbage. This movie is awesome, you'll laugh like there's no tomorrow. Beavis and Butt-head Do America gets 10 stars.

I very highly recommend this movie if you enjoy animated action comedies! Whatever you do, don't show it to your youngest children! XD Overall Rating: 9/10!

    I saw this movie just the other week and I've gotta say it's one of the best animated comedies ever made. The movie starts out with Beavis (Mike Judge) shaking Butt-Head (Mike Judge) to wake him up from a dream where he was trying to "score," to tell him that their TV has been stolen (completely oblivious to the broken window, crowbar, and footprints leading out the door). Finally, Butt-Head says, "Beavis! I think I've figured something out." Then after a few seconds, he says, "This sucks. It sucks more than anything that's ever sucked before." On a search for a new TV, the brain-dead duo meet Muddy Grimes (Bruce Willis) at a motel, who sends them to do his wife Dallas (Demi Moore) for $10,000. They meet up with her, and she plants a virus in Beavis' pants. The ATF go on a countrywide manhunt for Beavis and Butt-Head, who go across the country hoping to score. Like many of Mike Judge's works (like Office Space), there's a lot of quotable lines (Heh-heh, fire; He said "extend"), and some hilarious scenes (the humping vultures, the acid trip, both "great Cornholio" parts), and many other amazing qualities. 10/10 (Did this movie just score?)

    It's an all-out laugh-fest as Beavis and Butt-Head embark on a quest to get their TV back and, who knows, maybe even score! Uhuh huh huh. From start to finish, this movie is hilarious with all the classic antics the two idiots pull off while new elements are brought into the film. It still has some of the original characters like Mr. Vandreson and the mumbling principal while bringing in all new characters to get some chuckles out of. With wonderful jokes and stars like Bruce Willis, Demi Moore, and Robert Stack, Beavis and Butt-head Do America will make you laugh so hard you'll need two extra pairs of underwear! Go see this movie and hail the great Cornholio. Hehhehhehheh.

    Beavis and Butthead was one of the many points in my childhood where I knew, I was unlike anybody else. I was entertained beyond belief by these two dimwits who knew nothing in the world outside of their couch and their television. Seeing this movie young, most likely around ten, I honestly didn't like it. I found it to be "boring" and I hated how Beavis and Butthead left the town of Highland and ventured out into the big world. I watched it a year later and went on to like it. This is my third viewing. Now I can fully appreciate it. I understood all the jokes, but at the same time I wished the film took place in the town of Highland, I realize that the creators and the director, respectively, had to create a plot that was very large and made to fit an eighty-five minute run time. Not the usual five to ten minute run time the MTV program was used to. At the time, this movie was the near conclusion to the MTV program that ran for five years. There was rumored to be a sequel for years, and remained in development, but never happened. Fine by me. We got something better. It took fifteen years, but in 2011 it's said that the show will return to MTV with brand new episodes poking fun at music videos and viral videos. I'm skeptical, yet my excitement is through the roof. Beavis and Butthead Do America is about the two adolescents that go in search of their missing television set. Wandering into a motel, they become mistaken by a drunk named Muddy (Willis) as the men he hired to kill his wife. Saying he hired them to "do his wife," the boys believe they are being payed to have sex with Muddy's wife. The boys don't object, but then become labeled the most dangerous men in America by the FBI who are in search of a mysterious chip they call "the unit." The humor isn't as racy as people would expect. It maintains a PG-13 rating, and uses it neutrally. That comes off as one of its flaws, sadly. Like the South Park movie that boasted an R rating with very foul language and sex references, clearly showed what could be on the big screen differs greatly from Comedy Central. With Beavis and Butthead Do America, it does the same thing it would've done if it were a TV movie. Even The Simpson's Movie went a little further than its FOX limits. Still, it's worth it for the pleasure of seeing one of the greatest animated duos on the big screen doing what they do best, nothing. The best thing about the teens is they get in trouble, without even trying to get in trouble. They are a victim of bad timing, but somehow avoid every possible consequence. The FBI agent orders roadblocks, they are in the middle of the desert. They order the Dream America bus to stop, they get on a Nun's bus. My favorite scene is when their "peace'd out" teacher tries to tell them from the bottom of his heart that having no Television actually opens a window of opportunity. He claims people need to realize that we don't need TV to entertain us. After that very near and dear moment, all they pick up is "entert(ain us)." Beavis and Butthead Do America has gotten better with repeated viewings, but is seems it never was "boring." I think being young and dumb, the film didn't sit right with me for the reasons I stated above. After the third time, it was pretty cool. Starring: Mike Judge, Demi Moore, and Bruce Willis. Directed by: Mike Judge.

    I don't think Beavis and Butt Head Do America is quite as good as the wonderful TV show, but as far as a film based on a TV show goes, it is a worthy one and one of the better ones I've seen. It is a little too short and there are one or two scenes in the middle that could have done with a tighter pace. The animation is not quite as good as it is in the show, but it is still good and tries hard to stick to its style. The score is infectious and there is also a killer soundtrack. The characters are fun and likable and the story is funny, clever and well structured. The voices are also great, not just from the leads but also the celebrity voices. But the humour is what drives it, crude, vulgar and yes quite risqu&eacute; it is quite hilarious and sharp. All in all, a worthy film even if the TV show is better. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    I became a Beavis and Butt-head fanatic since it came on MTV, when this movie came out to theaters in 1996, I was thrilled and this movie made me laugh throughout the entire film!!! I was laughing like crazy. The films stars as a voice cast: Mike Judge (Beavis and Butt-head, Tom Anderson, Mr. Van Driessen, Principal McVicker), Bruce Willis (Muddy Grimes), Demi Moore (Dallas Grimes), Robert Stack (ATF Agent Flemming), etc. While awaking from a crazy dream, Beavis and Butt-head soon realize that their TV was stolen from a bunch of thieves, and they were mad, so its them on a journey across America to find their TV, not only that, someone is hold captive of a deadly device that belongs to the FBI, it can be found in Beavis's shorts. While searching for the TV, they stop a motel where Muddy Grimes (voice of Bruce Willis) wants them to get Dallas (voice of Demi Moore) back in relationship, elsewhere, they stop at Tom Anderson's trailer and they screwed up his TV, once they stop at Las Vegas, they found Dallas caught in a terrorist control. Chaos ensues when they mess around with the control panel of the Hoover Dam. While many places to go, they got lost in a desert with two Motley Crue roadies, after that, they nearly die from dehydration until Muddy came up to pick them up to get them to Washington DC. Once they get there, the agents are on the run of the unit. After that's taking care of, Tom Anderson, Muddy and Dallas Grimes were arrested and Beavis and Butt-head saved everybody from total chaos, finally, they found their TV lying on the motel sidewalk. This is classic Mike Judge at it's best, next to King of the Hill, and the movie Office Space. One of the funniest scenes in the movie is the Cornholio scene. I can laugh at that all night long. For a movie based cartoon film, it's 1,000,000 times better than that Spongebob Squarepants garbage. This movie is awesome, you'll laugh like there's no tomorrow. Beavis and Butt-head Do America gets 10 stars.

    This is one of the crappiest movies I've ever seen(although not completed). This "movie" is so crappy and so not-funny it was a pain to watch the hour I endured. I mean, come on... This is just completely boring, and immature, but not immature in a good way. I love cartoons like South Park, The Critic and The Simpsons, but this... the horror of this movie is unspeakable! Fart jokes can to a certain extent be funny, like in South Park and Family Guy, this piece of sh*t doesn't even seem to try. They can just sit there, fart and laugh that extremely annoying laugh, I should commit myself for therapy trying to cope with the terrors of this horrible, horrible "film"! Personally I think 1/10 stars is more than this "movie" deserves.

    After watching a couple of 'Beavis & Butthead' episodes on TV and a bunch on the Net, I instantly became a fan, and this just happened a couple of months ago.Now I really wanted to see the movie and I was unable to get the DVD and thought I would never get it.I eventually found a way.There was a site that I went to and I actually managed to watch the whole movie.What you need to know about Beavis and Butthead is that they're the most stupid duo in the history of animation.Think of Fry from 'Futurama' and Homer from 'The Simpsons' and you get Beavis and Butthead.The next thing you need to know about them is that they're addicted to television.When they find out that their set has been stolen, they go on a cross country adventure that involves a deadly poison, nuns, a man who seems to do a cavity search on any suspect or witness, and a really hot lady who's ex looks an awful like Kurt Russell from 'Death Proof'.All of this just to find their TV.Now what would you do? I'm sure you would do something simple like going to Best Buy and buy a new set instead of being hunted down by the FBI.So now you know that Beavis and Butthead are total idiots, yet their movie turns out almost brilliant.How is this possible? Beavis and Butthead's incredible stupidity makes it nearly impossible for you to take your eyes off of them.They're just that entertaining. As Butthead would say if saw this movie: "Uh-huh-huh.This movie's cool.Uh-huh-huh." Beavis would probably say: "I am the great Cornholio! I need TP for my bunghole!"

    Scoring with chicks obsesses Beavis and Butthead in director Mike Judge's first feature-length animated opus "Beavis & Butthead Do America," a rude but occasionally clever, cartoon farce that ridicules those two trendy, booger picking, adolescent slackers. Although I've seen my share of their television shenanigans, I haven't kept abreast of their obnoxious antics the way some of my friends have, so I tagged along with two Beavis and Butthead connoisseurs. My B & B fans felt "Beavis & Butthead Do America" was the equivalent of a greatest hits album of their clowning around on the tube. Aside from a surprise or two, Beavis and Butthead are just as nauseating on the big screen as they are on the small one. They did feel that "Do America" was a great way to introduce these reptilian life-forms to silver screen spectators. "Beavis & Butthead Do America" opens with two amusing sequences. The first spoofs "King Kong" with giant-sized versions of our lame-brained protagonists stomping helter-skelter though a miniature city while tanks and helicopters blast away at them. The sketchy animation looks pretty good on the big screen, too. In the second sequence, Isaac Hayes provides the lyrics to the hilarious title sequence that sends up the old ABC-TV undercover, law & order series "Starsky and Hutch," with our characters dresses up as the two heroic cops. Neither sequence has much to do with the other or the story in general, but the sequences are fun, and the film lurches off to a colorful start with them. The screenplay by "Beavis & Butthead" creator Mike Judge follows our protagonists across the United States. Thieves have stolen Beavis & Butthead's television set, and the kids set out to find them. Instead, they meet a thug called Muddy (voice of Bruce Willis) who promises them a small fortune if they will kill his wife. Of course, when our sex-starved idiots agree to "do" his wife, they make the mistake of thinking that Muddy means for them to engage in sexual relations with her. Ironically, the two thieves who pinched Beavis & Butthead's TV were supposed to carry out the hit for Muddy. Once this mistaken-identity plot gets underway, Federal Agents with the Department of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms appear like storm troopers for justice. They pursue Beavis and Butthead on a cross-country chase because they believe that the guys are terrorists with a horrible biological bomb. In an inspired bit of voice casting, "Untouchables" star Robert Stack provides the voice for their fascist nemesis. He resolves to capture the guys, and he forces anybody whose had contact with them to submit to deep cavity searches. Stack's voice is perfect because he plays the part with such deadpan sobriety. Other cute bits include Butthead's visit to the White House where he hits on Chelsea Clinton. Chelsea dumps him unceremoniously out the window in an act of defenestration. Later, the boys visit with President Clinton. He makes them honorary ATF agents. Another funny scene has Beavis and Butthead dismissing the geyser "Old Faithful" because they call it boring, only to be dazzled by urinals in a nearby toilet that flush when a light sensor is activated. Probably the only surprise in the entire comic film is their trek through the desert where they meet two scumbag bikers who turn out to be none other than their fathers. Undeniably, just as Beavis and Butthead is an acquired taste, so is this very crude comedy. The boys have changed little since their tube days. Beavis picks his nose constantly and repeatedly sings his bunghole song. The boys resemble the Trix rabbit in the cereal commercial because they never get what they want. The only characters from the TV series that drop in for appearances are Mr. Anderson, their hippie teacher, and their school principal. You won't see Mr. Buzzcut, Daria, or Stewart. If you enjoyed Beavis & Butthead on MTV, "Beavis & Butthead Do America" should make you chuckle often throughout its brisk 81-minute running time. If numbers are anything to go by, the $50 million plus that "Beavis & Butthead Do America" has grossed (pun intended!) at the box office thus far should guarantee a sequel.

    Animated MTV characters Beavis and Butt-Head made their feature film debut with this very funny movie that actually does a good job of sustaining itself for 81 minutes, with a pretty good story and plenty of the kind of humour that us B & B fans love so much. It's gleefully lowbrow stuff, and that's just the way we like it. Our favourite antisocial horn dog teenagers wake to discover that the most important item in their lives, their TV set, has been stolen, and their search leads them to a shady character named Muddy (voiced by Bruce Willis). Muddy offers them $10,000 to do his wife Dallas (voice of Demi Moore), and B & B readily accept after misinterpreting the word "do". They become embroiled in an elaborate plot to steal a powerful biological weapon, all while following the quintessential B & B agenda: trying to score! B & B's assorted adventures include making life miserable for cranky old neighbor Tom Anderson, causing havoc at places such as the Hoover Dam, the appearance of the legendary Cornholio (who, of course, just needs TP for his bunghole), encountering two very familiar looking former Motley Crue roadies, hallucinating in the desert, and having some eventful plane and bus rides. (It's just so priceless that B & B, upon seeing that they'll be on a bus full of nuns, can't see past the fact that their fellow passengers are chicks.) The colourful cast of characters also includes Agent Flemming (in an inspired bit of casting, Robert Stack voices this part), an ATF agent obsessed with cavity searches. Cloris Leachman plays the aged "slut" on the plane & bus, and Eric Bogosian, Richard Linklater, and David Letterman (billing himself as Earl Hofert) round out the various pop culture figures supplying voices. And everything is set to a kick ass soundtrack that begins with a "Shaft" style number co-written by Isaac Hayes and B & B creator Mike Judge. Other artists heard include the Red Hot Chili Peppers, White Zombie (Rob Zombie also supplies the artwork for the hallucination sequence), AC/DC, Rancid, LL Cool J, Ozzy Osbourne, and Butthole Surfers. If you're a fan of the TV series, you're sure to enjoy "Beavis & Butt-Head Do America". It's extremely agreeable from start to finish, and doesn't overstay its welcome. It delivers more laughs than a lot of live-action comedies. Eight out of 10.

    I got this fantastic film for My Birthday (Exactly 2 Months Ago!) and I have seen it about three times now! This film starts off with MTV's favorite dumb duo who set out on an adventure to America to find their lost TV! (They hope to "Score" along the way!) The film has a lot of very funny double entendr&eacute;s, as well as a lot of vulgar sexual references! This movie had me laughing a lot of the way! It may not have the political satire that the classic film: "South Park: Bigger, Longer And Uncut!" has, but the jokes in the film are still extremely laughable! The film ends with A Fictional Bill Clinton (It is a shame that The Real Bill Clinton himself didn't do the voice!) congratulating Beavis And Butthead for stopping America's Most Wanted Criminals! Before the end credits appear, Beavis And Butthead walk home with their found TV explaining the important moral of the story. The film reached my expectations and it was not a disappointment for me!

    This is one of the crappiest movies I've ever seen(although not completed). This "movie" is so crappy and so not-funny it was a pain to watch the hour I endured. I mean, come on... This is just completely boring, and immature, but not immature in a good way. I love cartoons like South Park, The Critic and The Simpsons, but this... the horror of this movie is unspeakable! Fart jokes can to a certain extent be funny, like in South Park and Family Guy, this piece of sh*t doesn't even seem to try. They can just sit there, fart and laugh that extremely annoying laugh, I should commit myself for therapy trying to cope with the terrors of this horrible, horrible "film"! Personally I think 1/10 stars is more than this "movie" deserves.

    After watching a couple of 'Beavis & Butthead' episodes on TV and a bunch on the Net, I instantly became a fan, and this just happened a couple of months ago.Now I really wanted to see the movie and I was unable to get the DVD and thought I would never get it.I eventually found a way.There was a site that I went to and I actually managed to watch the whole movie.What you need to know about Beavis and Butthead is that they're the most stupid duo in the history of animation.Think of Fry from 'Futurama' and Homer from 'The Simpsons' and you get Beavis and Butthead.The next thing you need to know about them is that they're addicted to television.When they find out that their set has been stolen, they go on a cross country adventure that involves a deadly poison, nuns, a man who seems to do a cavity search on any suspect or witness, and a really hot lady who's ex looks an awful like Kurt Russell from 'Death Proof'.All of this just to find their TV.Now what would you do? I'm sure you would do something simple like going to Best Buy and buy a new set instead of being hunted down by the FBI.So now you know that Beavis and Butthead are total idiots, yet their movie turns out almost brilliant.How is this possible? Beavis and Butthead's incredible stupidity makes it nearly impossible for you to take your eyes off of them.They're just that entertaining. As Butthead would say if saw this movie: "Uh-huh-huh.This movie's cool.Uh-huh-huh." Beavis would probably say: "I am the great Cornholio! I need TP for my bunghole!"

    Scoring with chicks obsesses Beavis and Butthead in director Mike Judge's first feature-length animated opus "Beavis & Butthead Do America," a rude but occasionally clever, cartoon farce that ridicules those two trendy, booger picking, adolescent slackers. Although I've seen my share of their television shenanigans, I haven't kept abreast of their obnoxious antics the way some of my friends have, so I tagged along with two Beavis and Butthead connoisseurs. My B & B fans felt "Beavis & Butthead Do America" was the equivalent of a greatest hits album of their clowning around on the tube. Aside from a surprise or two, Beavis and Butthead are just as nauseating on the big screen as they are on the small one. They did feel that "Do America" was a great way to introduce these reptilian life-forms to silver screen spectators. "Beavis & Butthead Do America" opens with two amusing sequences. The first spoofs "King Kong" with giant-sized versions of our lame-brained protagonists stomping helter-skelter though a miniature city while tanks and helicopters blast away at them. The sketchy animation looks pretty good on the big screen, too. In the second sequence, Isaac Hayes provides the lyrics to the hilarious title sequence that sends up the old ABC-TV undercover, law & order series "Starsky and Hutch," with our characters dresses up as the two heroic cops. Neither sequence has much to do with the other or the story in general, but the sequences are fun, and the film lurches off to a colorful start with them. The screenplay by "Beavis & Butthead" creator Mike Judge follows our protagonists across the United States. Thieves have stolen Beavis & Butthead's television set, and the kids set out to find them. Instead, they meet a thug called Muddy (voice of Bruce Willis) who promises them a small fortune if they will kill his wife. Of course, when our sex-starved idiots agree to "do" his wife, they make the mistake of thinking that Muddy means for them to engage in sexual relations with her. Ironically, the two thieves who pinched Beavis & Butthead's TV were supposed to carry out the hit for Muddy. Once this mistaken-identity plot gets underway, Federal Agents with the Department of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms appear like storm troopers for justice. They pursue Beavis and Butthead on a cross-country chase because they believe that the guys are terrorists with a horrible biological bomb. In an inspired bit of voice casting, "Untouchables" star Robert Stack provides the voice for their fascist nemesis. He resolves to capture the guys, and he forces anybody whose had contact with them to submit to deep cavity searches. Stack's voice is perfect because he plays the part with such deadpan sobriety. Other cute bits include Butthead's visit to the White House where he hits on Chelsea Clinton. Chelsea dumps him unceremoniously out the window in an act of defenestration. Later, the boys visit with President Clinton. He makes them honorary ATF agents. Another funny scene has Beavis and Butthead dismissing the geyser "Old Faithful" because they call it boring, only to be dazzled by urinals in a nearby toilet that flush when a light sensor is activated. Probably the only surprise in the entire comic film is their trek through the desert where they meet two scumbag bikers who turn out to be none other than their fathers. Undeniably, just as Beavis and Butthead is an acquired taste, so is this very crude comedy. The boys have changed little since their tube days. Beavis picks his nose constantly and repeatedly sings his bunghole song. The boys resemble the Trix rabbit in the cereal commercial because they never get what they want. The only characters from the TV series that drop in for appearances are Mr. Anderson, their hippie teacher, and their school principal. You won't see Mr. Buzzcut, Daria, or Stewart. If you enjoyed Beavis & Butthead on MTV, "Beavis & Butthead Do America" should make you chuckle often throughout its brisk 81-minute running time. If numbers are anything to go by, the $50 million plus that "Beavis & Butthead Do America" has grossed (pun intended!) at the box office thus far should guarantee a sequel.

    Animated MTV characters Beavis and Butt-Head made their feature film debut with this very funny movie that actually does a good job of sustaining itself for 81 minutes, with a pretty good story and plenty of the kind of humour that us B & B fans love so much. It's gleefully lowbrow stuff, and that's just the way we like it. Our favourite antisocial horn dog teenagers wake to discover that the most important item in their lives, their TV set, has been stolen, and their search leads them to a shady character named Muddy (voiced by Bruce Willis). Muddy offers them $10,000 to do his wife Dallas (voice of Demi Moore), and B & B readily accept after misinterpreting the word "do". They become embroiled in an elaborate plot to steal a powerful biological weapon, all while following the quintessential B & B agenda: trying to score! B & B's assorted adventures include making life miserable for cranky old neighbor Tom Anderson, causing havoc at places such as the Hoover Dam, the appearance of the legendary Cornholio (who, of course, just needs TP for his bunghole), encountering two very familiar looking former Motley Crue roadies, hallucinating in the desert, and having some eventful plane and bus rides. (It's just so priceless that B & B, upon seeing that they'll be on a bus full of nuns, can't see past the fact that their fellow passengers are chicks.) The colourful cast of characters also includes Agent Flemming (in an inspired bit of casting, Robert Stack voices this part), an ATF agent obsessed with cavity searches. Cloris Leachman plays the aged "slut" on the plane & bus, and Eric Bogosian, Richard Linklater, and David Letterman (billing himself as Earl Hofert) round out the various pop culture figures supplying voices. And everything is set to a kick ass soundtrack that begins with a "Shaft" style number co-written by Isaac Hayes and B & B creator Mike Judge. Other artists heard include the Red Hot Chili Peppers, White Zombie (Rob Zombie also supplies the artwork for the hallucination sequence), AC/DC, Rancid, LL Cool J, Ozzy Osbourne, and Butthole Surfers. If you're a fan of the TV series, you're sure to enjoy "Beavis & Butt-Head Do America". It's extremely agreeable from start to finish, and doesn't overstay its welcome. It delivers more laughs than a lot of live-action comedies. Eight out of 10.

    I got this fantastic film for My Birthday (Exactly 2 Months Ago!) and I have seen it about three times now! This film starts off with MTV's favorite dumb duo who set out on an adventure to America to find their lost TV! (They hope to "Score" along the way!) The film has a lot of very funny double entendr&eacute;s, as well as a lot of vulgar sexual references! This movie had me laughing a lot of the way! It may not have the political satire that the classic film: "South Park: Bigger, Longer And Uncut!" has, but the jokes in the film are still extremely laughable! The film ends with A Fictional Bill Clinton (It is a shame that The Real Bill Clinton himself didn't do the voice!) congratulating Beavis And Butthead for stopping America's Most Wanted Criminals! Before the end credits appear, Beavis And Butthead walk home with their found TV explaining the important moral of the story. The film reached my expectations and it was not a disappointment for me! I very highly recommend this movie if you enjoy animated action comedies! Whatever you do, don't show it to your youngest children! XD Overall Rating: 9/10!

    I saw this movie just the other week and I've gotta say it's one of the best animated comedies ever made. The movie starts out with Beavis (Mike Judge) shaking Butt-Head (Mike Judge) to wake him up from a dream where he was trying to "score," to tell him that their TV has been stolen (completely oblivious to the broken window, crowbar, and footprints leading out the door). Finally, Butt-Head says, "Beavis! I think I've figured something out." Then after a few seconds, he says, "This sucks. It sucks more than anything that's ever sucked before." On a search for a new TV, the brain-dead duo meet Muddy Grimes (Bruce Willis) at a motel, who sends them to do his wife Dallas (Demi Moore) for $10,000. They meet up with her, and she plants a virus in Beavis' pants. The ATF go on a countrywide manhunt for Beavis and Butt-Head, who go across the country hoping to score. Like many of Mike Judge's works (like Office Space), there's a lot of quotable lines (Heh-heh, fire; He said "extend"), and some hilarious scenes (the humping vultures, the acid trip, both "great Cornholio" parts), and many other amazing qualities. 10/10 (Did this movie just score?)

    It's an all-out laugh-fest as Beavis and Butt-Head embark on a quest to get their TV back and, who knows, maybe even score! Uhuh huh huh. From start to finish, this movie is hilarious with all the classic antics the two idiots pull off while new elements are brought into the film. It still has some of the original characters like Mr. Vandreson and the mumbling principal while bringing in all new characters to get some chuckles out of. With wonderful jokes and stars like Bruce Willis, Demi Moore, and Robert Stack, Beavis and Butt-head Do America will make you laugh so hard you'll need two extra pairs of underwear! Go see this movie and hail the great Cornholio. Hehhehhehheh.

    Beavis and Butthead was one of the many points in my childhood where I knew, I was unlike anybody else. I was entertained beyond belief by these two dimwits who knew nothing in the world outside of their couch and their television. Seeing this movie young, most likely around ten, I honestly didn't like it. I found it to be "boring" and I hated how Beavis and Butthead left the town of Highland and ventured out into the big world. I watched it a year later and went on to like it. This is my third viewing. Now I can fully appreciate it. I understood all the jokes, but at the same time I wished the film took place in the town of Highland, I realize that the creators and the director, respectively, had to create a plot that was very large and made to fit an eighty-five minute run time. Not the usual five to ten minute run time the MTV program was used to. At the time, this movie was the near conclusion to the MTV program that ran for five years. There was rumored to be a sequel for years, and remained in development, but never happened. Fine by me. We got something better. It took fifteen years, but in 2011 it's said that the show will return to MTV with brand new episodes poking fun at music videos and viral videos. I'm skeptical, yet my excitement is through the roof. Beavis and Butthead Do America is about the two adolescents that go in search of their missing television set. Wandering into a motel, they become mistaken by a drunk named Muddy (Willis) as the men he hired to kill his wife. Saying he hired them to "do his wife," the boys believe they are being payed to have sex with Muddy's wife. The boys don't object, but then become labeled the most dangerous men in America by the FBI who are in search of a mysterious chip they call "the unit." The humor isn't as racy as people would expect. It maintains a PG-13 rating, and uses it neutrally. That comes off as one of its flaws, sadly. Like the South Park movie that boasted an R rating with very foul language and sex references, clearly showed what could be on the big screen differs greatly from Comedy Central. With Beavis and Butthead Do America, it does the same thing it would've done if it were a TV movie. Even The Simpson's Movie went a little further than its FOX limits. Still, it's worth it for the pleasure of seeing one of the greatest animated duos on the big screen doing what they do best, nothing. The best thing about the teens is they get in trouble, without even trying to get in trouble. They are a victim of bad timing, but somehow avoid every possible consequence. The FBI agent orders roadblocks, they are in the middle of the desert. They order the Dream America bus to stop, they get on a Nun's bus. My favorite scene is when their "peace'd out" teacher tries to tell them from the bottom of his heart that having no Television actually opens a window of opportunity. He claims people need to realize that we don't need TV to entertain us. After that very near and dear moment, all they pick up is "entert(ain us)." Beavis and Butthead Do America has gotten better with repeated viewings, but is seems it never was "boring." I think being young and dumb, the film didn't sit right with me for the reasons I stated above. After the third time, it was pretty cool. Starring: Mike Judge, Demi Moore, and Bruce Willis. Directed by: Mike Judge.

    I don't think Beavis and Butt Head Do America is quite as good as the wonderful TV show, but as far as a film based on a TV show goes, it is a worthy one and one of the better ones I've seen. It is a little too short and there are one or two scenes in the middle that could have done with a tighter pace. The animation is not quite as good as it is in the show, but it is still good and tries hard to stick to its style. The score is infectious and there is also a killer soundtrack. The characters are fun and likable and the story is funny, clever and well structured. The voices are also great, not just from the leads but also the celebrity voices. But the humour is what drives it, crude, vulgar and yes quite risqu&eacute; it is quite hilarious and sharp. All in all, a worthy film even if the TV show is better. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    I became a Beavis and Butt-head fanatic since it came on MTV, when this movie came out to theaters in 1996, I was thrilled and this movie made me laugh throughout the entire film!!! I was laughing like crazy. The films stars as a voice cast: Mike Judge (Beavis and Butt-head, Tom Anderson, Mr. Van Driessen, Principal McVicker), Bruce Willis (Muddy Grimes), Demi Moore (Dallas Grimes), Robert Stack (ATF Agent Flemming), etc. While awaking from a crazy dream, Beavis and Butt-head soon realize that their TV was stolen from a bunch of thieves, and they were mad, so its them on a journey across America to find their TV, not only that, someone is hold captive of a deadly device that belongs to the FBI, it can be found in Beavis's shorts. While searching for the TV, they stop a motel where Muddy Grimes (voice of Bruce Willis) wants them to get Dallas (voice of Demi Moore) back in relationship, elsewhere, they stop at Tom Anderson's trailer and they screwed up his TV, once they stop at Las Vegas, they found Dallas caught in a terrorist control. Chaos ensues when they mess around with the control panel of the Hoover Dam. While many places to go, they got lost in a desert with two Motley Crue roadies, after that, they nearly die from dehydration until Muddy came up to pick them up to get them to Washington DC. Once they get there, the agents are on the run of the unit. After that's taking care of, Tom Anderson, Muddy and Dallas Grimes were arrested and Beavis and Butt-head saved everybody from total chaos, finally, they found their TV lying on the motel sidewalk. This is classic Mike Judge at it's best, next to King of the Hill, and the movie Office Space. One of the funniest scenes in the movie is the Cornholio scene. I can laugh at that all night long. For a movie based cartoon film, it's 1,000,000 times better than that Spongebob Squarepants garbage. This movie is awesome, you'll laugh like there's no tomorrow. Beavis and Butt-head Do America gets 10 stars.

Before the end credits appear, Beavis And Butthead walk home with their found TV explaining the important moral of the story. The film reached my expectations and it was not a disappointment for me! I very highly recommend this movie if you enjoy animated action comedies! Whatever you do, don't show it to your youngest children! XD Overall Rating: 9/10!

    I saw this movie just the other week and I've gotta say it's one of the best animated comedies ever made. The movie starts out with Beavis (Mike Judge) shaking Butt-Head (Mike Judge) to wake him up from a dream where he was trying to "score," to tell him that their TV has been stolen (completely oblivious to the broken window, crowbar, and footprints leading out the door). Finally, Butt-Head says, "Beavis! I think I've figured something out." Then after a few seconds, he says, "This sucks. It sucks more than anything that's ever sucked before." On a search for a new TV, the brain-dead duo meet Muddy Grimes (Bruce Willis) at a motel, who sends them to do his wife Dallas (Demi Moore) for $10,000. They meet up with her, and she plants a virus in Beavis' pants. The ATF go on a countrywide manhunt for Beavis and Butt-Head, who go across the country hoping to score. Like many of Mike Judge's works (like Office Space), there's a lot of quotable lines (Heh-heh, fire; He said "extend"), and some hilarious scenes (the humping vultures, the acid trip, both "great Cornholio" parts), and many other amazing qualities. 10/10 (Did this movie just score?)

    It's an all-out laugh-fest as Beavis and Butt-Head embark on a quest to get their TV back and, who knows, maybe even score! Uhuh huh huh. From start to finish, this movie is hilarious with all the classic antics the two idiots pull off while new elements are brought into the film. It still has some of the original characters like Mr. Vandreson and the mumbling principal while bringing in all new characters to get some chuckles out of. With wonderful jokes and stars like Bruce Willis, Demi Moore, and Robert Stack, Beavis and Butt-head Do America will make you laugh so hard you'll need two extra pairs of underwear! Go see this movie and hail the great Cornholio. Hehhehhehheh.

    Beavis and Butthead was one of the many points in my childhood where I knew, I was unlike anybody else. I was entertained beyond belief by these two dimwits who knew nothing in the world outside of their couch and their television. Seeing this movie young, most likely around ten, I honestly didn't like it. I found it to be "boring" and I hated how Beavis and Butthead left the town of Highland and ventured out into the big world. I watched it a year later and went on to like it. This is my third viewing. Now I can fully appreciate it. I understood all the jokes, but at the same time I wished the film took place in the town of Highland, I realize that the creators and the director, respectively, had to create a plot that was very large and made to fit an eighty-five minute run time. Not the usual five to ten minute run time the MTV program was used to. At the time, this movie was the near conclusion to the MTV program that ran for five years. There was rumored to be a sequel for years, and remained in development, but never happened. Fine by me. We got something better. It took fifteen years, but in 2011 it's said that the show will return to MTV with brand new episodes poking fun at music videos and viral videos. I'm skeptical, yet my excitement is through the roof. Beavis and Butthead Do America is about the two adolescents that go in search of their missing television set. Wandering into a motel, they become mistaken by a drunk named Muddy (Willis) as the men he hired to kill his wife. Saying he hired them to "do his wife," the boys believe they are being payed to have sex with Muddy's wife. The boys don't object, but then become labeled the most dangerous men in America by the FBI who are in search of a mysterious chip they call "the unit." The humor isn't as racy as people would expect. It maintains a PG-13 rating, and uses it neutrally. That comes off as one of its flaws, sadly. Like the South Park movie that boasted an R rating with very foul language and sex references, clearly showed what could be on the big screen differs greatly from Comedy Central. With Beavis and Butthead Do America, it does the same thing it would've done if it were a TV movie. Even The Simpson's Movie went a little further than its FOX limits. Still, it's worth it for the pleasure of seeing one of the greatest animated duos on the big screen doing what they do best, nothing. The best thing about the teens is they get in trouble, without even trying to get in trouble. They are a victim of bad timing, but somehow avoid every possible consequence. The FBI agent orders roadblocks, they are in the middle of the desert. They order the Dream America bus to stop, they get on a Nun's bus. My favorite scene is when their "peace'd out" teacher tries to tell them from the bottom of his heart that having no Television actually opens a window of opportunity. He claims people need to realize that we don't need TV to entertain us. After that very near and dear moment, all they pick up is "entert(ain us)." Beavis and Butthead Do America has gotten better with repeated viewings, but is seems it never was "boring." I think being young and dumb, the film didn't sit right with me for the reasons I stated above. After the third time, it was pretty cool. Starring: Mike Judge, Demi Moore, and Bruce Willis. Directed by: Mike Judge.

    I don't think Beavis and Butt Head Do America is quite as good as the wonderful TV show, but as far as a film based on a TV show goes, it is a worthy one and one of the better ones I've seen. It is a little too short and there are one or two scenes in the middle that could have done with a tighter pace. The animation is not quite as good as it is in the show, but it is still good and tries hard to stick to its style. The score is infectious and there is also a killer soundtrack. The characters are fun and likable and the story is funny, clever and well structured. The voices are also great, not just from the leads but also the celebrity voices. But the humour is what drives it, crude, vulgar and yes quite risqu&eacute; it is quite hilarious and sharp. All in all, a worthy film even if the TV show is better. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    I became a Beavis and Butt-head fanatic since it came on MTV, when this movie came out to theaters in 1996, I was thrilled and this movie made me laugh throughout the entire film!!! I was laughing like crazy. The films stars as a voice cast: Mike Judge (Beavis and Butt-head, Tom Anderson, Mr. Van Driessen, Principal McVicker), Bruce Willis (Muddy Grimes), Demi Moore (Dallas Grimes), Robert Stack (ATF Agent Flemming), etc. While awaking from a crazy dream, Beavis and Butt-head soon realize that their TV was stolen from a bunch of thieves, and they were mad, so its them on a journey across America to find their TV, not only that, someone is hold captive of a deadly device that belongs to the FBI, it can be found in Beavis's shorts. While searching for the TV, they stop a motel where Muddy Grimes (voice of Bruce Willis) wants them to get Dallas (voice of Demi Moore) back in relationship, elsewhere, they stop at Tom Anderson's trailer and they screwed up his TV, once they stop at Las Vegas, they found Dallas caught in a terrorist control. Chaos ensues when they mess around with the control panel of the Hoover Dam. While many places to go, they got lost in a desert with two Motley Crue roadies, after that, they nearly die from dehydration until Muddy came up to pick them up to get them to Washington DC. Once they get there, the agents are on the run of the unit. After that's taking care of, Tom Anderson, Muddy and Dallas Grimes were arrested and Beavis and Butt-head saved everybody from total chaos, finally, they found their TV lying on the motel sidewalk. This is classic Mike Judge at it's best, next to King of the Hill, and the movie Office Space. One of the funniest scenes in the movie is the Cornholio scene. I can laugh at that all night long. For a movie based cartoon film, it's 1,000,000 times better than that Spongebob Squarepants garbage. This movie is awesome, you'll laugh like there's no tomorrow. Beavis and Butt-head Do America gets 10 stars.

    This is one of the crappiest movies I've ever seen(although not completed). This "movie" is so crappy and so not-funny it was a pain to watch the hour I endured. I mean, come on... This is just completely boring, and immature, but not immature in a good way. I love cartoons like South Park, The Critic and The Simpsons, but this... the horror of this movie is unspeakable! Fart jokes can to a certain extent be funny, like in South Park and Family Guy, this piece of sh*t doesn't even seem to try. They can just sit there, fart and laugh that extremely annoying laugh, I should commit myself for therapy trying to cope with the terrors of this horrible, horrible "film"! Personally I think 1/10 stars is more than this "movie" deserves.

    After watching a couple of 'Beavis & Butthead' episodes on TV and a bunch on the Net, I instantly became a fan, and this just happened a couple of months ago.Now I really wanted to see the movie and I was unable to get the DVD and thought I would never get it.I eventually found a way.There was a site that I went to and I actually managed to watch the whole movie.What you need to know about Beavis and Butthead is that they're the most stupid duo in the history of animation.Think of Fry from 'Futurama' and Homer from 'The Simpsons' and you get Beavis and Butthead.The next thing you need to know about them is that they're addicted to television.When they find out that their set has been stolen, they go on a cross country adventure that involves a deadly poison, nuns, a man who seems to do a cavity search on any suspect or witness, and a really hot lady who's ex looks an awful like Kurt Russell from 'Death Proof'.All of this just to find their TV.Now what would you do? I'm sure you would do something simple like going to Best Buy and buy a new set instead of being hunted down by the FBI.So now you know that Beavis and Butthead are total idiots, yet their movie turns out almost brilliant.How is this possible? Beavis and Butthead's incredible stupidity makes it nearly impossible for you to take your eyes off of them.They're just that entertaining. As Butthead would say if saw this movie: "Uh-huh-huh.This movie's cool.Uh-huh-huh." Beavis would probably say: "I am the great Cornholio! I need TP for my bunghole!"

    Scoring with chicks obsesses Beavis and Butthead in director Mike Judge's first feature-length animated opus "Beavis & Butthead Do America," a rude but occasionally clever, cartoon farce that ridicules those two trendy, booger picking, adolescent slackers. Although I've seen my share of their television shenanigans, I haven't kept abreast of their obnoxious antics the way some of my friends have, so I tagged along with two Beavis and Butthead connoisseurs. My B & B fans felt "Beavis & Butthead Do America" was the equivalent of a greatest hits album of their clowning around on the tube. Aside from a surprise or two, Beavis and Butthead are just as nauseating on the big screen as they are on the small one. They did feel that "Do America" was a great way to introduce these reptilian life-forms to silver screen spectators. "Beavis & Butthead Do America" opens with two amusing sequences. The first spoofs "King Kong" with giant-sized versions of our lame-brained protagonists stomping helter-skelter though a miniature city while tanks and helicopters blast away at them. The sketchy animation looks pretty good on the big screen, too. In the second sequence, Isaac Hayes provides the lyrics to the hilarious title sequence that sends up the old ABC-TV undercover, law & order series "Starsky and Hutch," with our characters dresses up as the two heroic cops. Neither sequence has much to do with the other or the story in general, but the sequences are fun, and the film lurches off to a colorful start with them. The screenplay by "Beavis & Butthead" creator Mike Judge follows our protagonists across the United States. Thieves have stolen Beavis & Butthead's television set, and the kids set out to find them. Instead, they meet a thug called Muddy (voice of Bruce Willis) who promises them a small fortune if they will kill his wife. Of course, when our sex-starved idiots agree to "do" his wife, they make the mistake of thinking that Muddy means for them to engage in sexual relations with her. Ironically, the two thieves who pinched Beavis & Butthead's TV were supposed to carry out the hit for Muddy. Once this mistaken-identity plot gets underway, Federal Agents with the Department of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms appear like storm troopers for justice. They pursue Beavis and Butthead on a cross-country chase because they believe that the guys are terrorists with a horrible biological bomb. In an inspired bit of voice casting, "Untouchables" star Robert Stack provides the voice for their fascist nemesis. He resolves to capture the guys, and he forces anybody whose had contact with them to submit to deep cavity searches. Stack's voice is perfect because he plays the part with such deadpan sobriety. Other cute bits include Butthead's visit to the White House where he hits on Chelsea Clinton. Chelsea dumps him unceremoniously out the window in an act of defenestration. Later, the boys visit with President Clinton. He makes them honorary ATF agents. Another funny scene has Beavis and Butthead dismissing the geyser "Old Faithful" because they call it boring, only to be dazzled by urinals in a nearby toilet that flush when a light sensor is activated. Probably the only surprise in the entire comic film is their trek through the desert where they meet two scumbag bikers who turn out to be none other than their fathers. Undeniably, just as Beavis and Butthead is an acquired taste, so is this very crude comedy. The boys have changed little since their tube days. Beavis picks his nose constantly and repeatedly sings his bunghole song. The boys resemble the Trix rabbit in the cereal commercial because they never get what they want. The only characters from the TV series that drop in for appearances are Mr. Anderson, their hippie teacher, and their school principal. You won't see Mr. Buzzcut, Daria, or Stewart. If you enjoyed Beavis & Butthead on MTV, "Beavis & Butthead Do America" should make you chuckle often throughout its brisk 81-minute running time. If numbers are anything to go by, the $50 million plus that "Beavis & Butthead Do America" has grossed (pun intended!) at the box office thus far should guarantee a sequel.

    Animated MTV characters Beavis and Butt-Head made their feature film debut with this very funny movie that actually does a good job of sustaining itself for 81 minutes, with a pretty good story and plenty of the kind of humour that us B & B fans love so much. It's gleefully lowbrow stuff, and that's just the way we like it. Our favourite antisocial horn dog teenagers wake to discover that the most important item in their lives, their TV set, has been stolen, and their search leads them to a shady character named Muddy (voiced by Bruce Willis). Muddy offers them $10,000 to do his wife Dallas (voice of Demi Moore), and B & B readily accept after misinterpreting the word "do". They become embroiled in an elaborate plot to steal a powerful biological weapon, all while following the quintessential B & B agenda: trying to score! B & B's assorted adventures include making life miserable for cranky old neighbor Tom Anderson, causing havoc at places such as the Hoover Dam, the appearance of the legendary Cornholio (who, of course, just needs TP for his bunghole), encountering two very familiar looking former Motley Crue roadies, hallucinating in the desert, and having some eventful plane and bus rides. (It's just so priceless that B & B, upon seeing that they'll be on a bus full of nuns, can't see past the fact that their fellow passengers are chicks.) The colourful cast of characters also includes Agent Flemming (in an inspired bit of casting, Robert Stack voices this part), an ATF agent obsessed with cavity searches. Cloris Leachman plays the aged "slut" on the plane & bus, and Eric Bogosian, Richard Linklater, and David Letterman (billing himself as Earl Hofert) round out the various pop culture figures supplying voices. And everything is set to a kick ass soundtrack that begins with a "Shaft" style number co-written by Isaac Hayes and B & B creator Mike Judge. Other artists heard include the Red Hot Chili Peppers, White Zombie (Rob Zombie also supplies the artwork for the hallucination sequence), AC/DC, Rancid, LL Cool J, Ozzy Osbourne, and Butthole Surfers. If you're a fan of the TV series, you're sure to enjoy "Beavis & Butt-Head Do America". It's extremely agreeable from start to finish, and doesn't overstay its welcome. It delivers more laughs than a lot of live-action comedies. Eight out of 10.

    I got this fantastic film for My Birthday (Exactly 2 Months Ago!) and I have seen it about three times now! This film starts off with MTV's favorite dumb duo who set out on an adventure to America to find their lost TV! (They hope to "Score" along the way!) The film has a lot of very funny double entendr&eacute;s, as well as a lot of vulgar sexual references! This movie had me laughing a lot of the way! It may not have the political satire that the classic film: "South Park: Bigger, Longer And Uncut!" has, but the jokes in the film are still extremely laughable! The film ends with A Fictional Bill Clinton (It is a shame that The Real Bill Clinton himself didn't do the voice!) congratulating Beavis And Butthead for stopping America's Most Wanted Criminals! Before the end credits appear, Beavis And Butthead walk home with their found TV explaining the important moral of the story. The film reached my expectations and it was not a disappointment for me!

    This is one of the crappiest movies I've ever seen(although not completed). This "movie" is so crappy and so not-funny it was a pain to watch the hour I endured. I mean, come on... This is just completely boring, and immature, but not immature in a good way. I love cartoons like South Park, The Critic and The Simpsons, but this... the horror of this movie is unspeakable! Fart jokes can to a certain extent be funny, like in South Park and Family Guy, this piece of sh*t doesn't even seem to try. They can just sit there, fart and laugh that extremely annoying laugh, I should commit myself for therapy trying to cope with the terrors of this horrible, horrible "film"! Personally I think 1/10 stars is more than this "movie" deserves.

    After watching a couple of 'Beavis & Butthead' episodes on TV and a bunch on the Net, I instantly became a fan, and this just happened a couple of months ago.Now I really wanted to see the movie and I was unable to get the DVD and thought I would never get it.I eventually found a way.There was a site that I went to and I actually managed to watch the whole movie.What you need to know about Beavis and Butthead is that they're the most stupid duo in the history of animation.Think of Fry from 'Futurama' and Homer from 'The Simpsons' and you get Beavis and Butthead.The next thing you need to know about them is that they're addicted to television.When they find out that their set has been stolen, they go on a cross country adventure that involves a deadly poison, nuns, a man who seems to do a cavity search on any suspect or witness, and a really hot lady who's ex looks an awful like Kurt Russell from 'Death Proof'.All of this just to find their TV.Now what would you do? I'm sure you would do something simple like going to Best Buy and buy a new set instead of being hunted down by the FBI.So now you know that Beavis and Butthead are total idiots, yet their movie turns out almost brilliant.How is this possible? Beavis and Butthead's incredible stupidity makes it nearly impossible for you to take your eyes off of them.They're just that entertaining. As Butthead would say if saw this movie: "Uh-huh-huh.This movie's cool.Uh-huh-huh." Beavis would probably say: "I am the great Cornholio! I need TP for my bunghole!"

    Scoring with chicks obsesses Beavis and Butthead in director Mike Judge's first feature-length animated opus "Beavis & Butthead Do America," a rude but occasionally clever, cartoon farce that ridicules those two trendy, booger picking, adolescent slackers. Although I've seen my share of their television shenanigans, I haven't kept abreast of their obnoxious antics the way some of my friends have, so I tagged along with two Beavis and Butthead connoisseurs. My B & B fans felt "Beavis & Butthead Do America" was the equivalent of a greatest hits album of their clowning around on the tube. Aside from a surprise or two, Beavis and Butthead are just as nauseating on the big screen as they are on the small one. They did feel that "Do America" was a great way to introduce these reptilian life-forms to silver screen spectators. "Beavis & Butthead Do America" opens with two amusing sequences. The first spoofs "King Kong" with giant-sized versions of our lame-brained protagonists stomping helter-skelter though a miniature city while tanks and helicopters blast away at them. The sketchy animation looks pretty good on the big screen, too. In the second sequence, Isaac Hayes provides the lyrics to the hilarious title sequence that sends up the old ABC-TV undercover, law & order series "Starsky and Hutch," with our characters dresses up as the two heroic cops. Neither sequence has much to do with the other or the story in general, but the sequences are fun, and the film lurches off to a colorful start with them. The screenplay by "Beavis & Butthead" creator Mike Judge follows our protagonists across the United States. Thieves have stolen Beavis & Butthead's television set, and the kids set out to find them. Instead, they meet a thug called Muddy (voice of Bruce Willis) who promises them a small fortune if they will kill his wife. Of course, when our sex-starved idiots agree to "do" his wife, they make the mistake of thinking that Muddy means for them to engage in sexual relations with her. Ironically, the two thieves who pinched Beavis & Butthead's TV were supposed to carry out the hit for Muddy. Once this mistaken-identity plot gets underway, Federal Agents with the Department of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms appear like storm troopers for justice. They pursue Beavis and Butthead on a cross-country chase because they believe that the guys are terrorists with a horrible biological bomb. In an inspired bit of voice casting, "Untouchables" star Robert Stack provides the voice for their fascist nemesis. He resolves to capture the guys, and he forces anybody whose had contact with them to submit to deep cavity searches. Stack's voice is perfect because he plays the part with such deadpan sobriety. Other cute bits include Butthead's visit to the White House where he hits on Chelsea Clinton. Chelsea dumps him unceremoniously out the window in an act of defenestration. Later, the boys visit with President Clinton. He makes them honorary ATF agents. Another funny scene has Beavis and Butthead dismissing the geyser "Old Faithful" because they call it boring, only to be dazzled by urinals in a nearby toilet that flush when a light sensor is activated. Probably the only surprise in the entire comic film is their trek through the desert where they meet two scumbag bikers who turn out to be none other than their fathers. Undeniably, just as Beavis and Butthead is an acquired taste, so is this very crude comedy. The boys have changed little since their tube days. Beavis picks his nose constantly and repeatedly sings his bunghole song. The boys resemble the Trix rabbit in the cereal commercial because they never get what they want. The only characters from the TV series that drop in for appearances are Mr. Anderson, their hippie teacher, and their school principal. You won't see Mr. Buzzcut, Daria, or Stewart. If you enjoyed Beavis & Butthead on MTV, "Beavis & Butthead Do America" should make you chuckle often throughout its brisk 81-minute running time. If numbers are anything to go by, the $50 million plus that "Beavis & Butthead Do America" has grossed (pun intended!) at the box office thus far should guarantee a sequel.

    Animated MTV characters Beavis and Butt-Head made their feature film debut with this very funny movie that actually does a good job of sustaining itself for 81 minutes, with a pretty good story and plenty of the kind of humour that us B & B fans love so much. It's gleefully lowbrow stuff, and that's just the way we like it. Our favourite antisocial horn dog teenagers wake to discover that the most important item in their lives, their TV set, has been stolen, and their search leads them to a shady character named Muddy (voiced by Bruce Willis). Muddy offers them $10,000 to do his wife Dallas (voice of Demi Moore), and B & B readily accept after misinterpreting the word "do". They become embroiled in an elaborate plot to steal a powerful biological weapon, all while following the quintessential B & B agenda: trying to score! B & B's assorted adventures include making life miserable for cranky old neighbor Tom Anderson, causing havoc at places such as the Hoover Dam, the appearance of the legendary Cornholio (who, of course, just needs TP for his bunghole), encountering two very familiar looking former Motley Crue roadies, hallucinating in the desert, and having some eventful plane and bus rides. (It's just so priceless that B & B, upon seeing that they'll be on a bus full of nuns, can't see past the fact that their fellow passengers are chicks.) The colourful cast of characters also includes Agent Flemming (in an inspired bit of casting, Robert Stack voices this part), an ATF agent obsessed with cavity searches. Cloris Leachman plays the aged "slut" on the plane & bus, and Eric Bogosian, Richard Linklater, and David Letterman (billing himself as Earl Hofert) round out the various pop culture figures supplying voices. And everything is set to a kick ass soundtrack that begins with a "Shaft" style number co-written by Isaac Hayes and B & B creator Mike Judge. Other artists heard include the Red Hot Chili Peppers, White Zombie (Rob Zombie also supplies the artwork for the hallucination sequence), AC/DC, Rancid, LL Cool J, Ozzy Osbourne, and Butthole Surfers. If you're a fan of the TV series, you're sure to enjoy "Beavis & Butt-Head Do America". It's extremely agreeable from start to finish, and doesn't overstay its welcome. It delivers more laughs than a lot of live-action comedies. Eight out of 10.

    I got this fantastic film for My Birthday (Exactly 2 Months Ago!) and I have seen it about three times now! This film starts off with MTV's favorite dumb duo who set out on an adventure to America to find their lost TV! (They hope to "Score" along the way!) The film has a lot of very funny double entendr&eacute;s, as well as a lot of vulgar sexual references! This movie had me laughing a lot of the way! It may not have the political satire that the classic film: "South Park: Bigger, Longer And Uncut!" has, but the jokes in the film are still extremely laughable! The film ends with A Fictional Bill Clinton (It is a shame that The Real Bill Clinton himself didn't do the voice!) congratulating Beavis And Butthead for stopping America's Most Wanted Criminals! Before the end credits appear, Beavis And Butthead walk home with their found TV explaining the important moral of the story. The film reached my expectations and it was not a disappointment for me! I very highly recommend this movie if you enjoy animated action comedies! Whatever you do, don't show it to your youngest children! XD Overall Rating: 9/10!

    I saw this movie just the other week and I've gotta say it's one of the best animated comedies ever made. The movie starts out with Beavis (Mike Judge) shaking Butt-Head (Mike Judge) to wake him up from a dream where he was trying to "score," to tell him that their TV has been stolen (completely oblivious to the broken window, crowbar, and footprints leading out the door). Finally, Butt-Head says, "Beavis! I think I've figured something out." Then after a few seconds, he says, "This sucks. It sucks more than anything that's ever sucked before." On a search for a new TV, the brain-dead duo meet Muddy Grimes (Bruce Willis) at a motel, who sends them to do his wife Dallas (Demi Moore) for $10,000. They meet up with her, and she plants a virus in Beavis' pants. The ATF go on a countrywide manhunt for Beavis and Butt-Head, who go across the country hoping to score. Like many of Mike Judge's works (like Office Space), there's a lot of quotable lines (Heh-heh, fire; He said "extend"), and some hilarious scenes (the humping vultures, the acid trip, both "great Cornholio" parts), and many other amazing qualities. 10/10 (Did this movie just score?)

    It's an all-out laugh-fest as Beavis and Butt-Head embark on a quest to get their TV back and, who knows, maybe even score! Uhuh huh huh. From start to finish, this movie is hilarious with all the classic antics the two idiots pull off while new elements are brought into the film. It still has some of the original characters like Mr. Vandreson and the mumbling principal while bringing in all new characters to get some chuckles out of. With wonderful jokes and stars like Bruce Willis, Demi Moore, and Robert Stack, Beavis and Butt-head Do America will make you laugh so hard you'll need two extra pairs of underwear! Go see this movie and hail the great Cornholio. Hehhehhehheh.

    Beavis and Butthead was one of the many points in my childhood where I knew, I was unlike anybody else. I was entertained beyond belief by these two dimwits who knew nothing in the world outside of their couch and their television. Seeing this movie young, most likely around ten, I honestly didn't like it. I found it to be "boring" and I hated how Beavis and Butthead left the town of Highland and ventured out into the big world. I watched it a year later and went on to like it. This is my third viewing. Now I can fully appreciate it. I understood all the jokes, but at the same time I wished the film took place in the town of Highland, I realize that the creators and the director, respectively, had to create a plot that was very large and made to fit an eighty-five minute run time. Not the usual five to ten minute run time the MTV program was used to. At the time, this movie was the near conclusion to the MTV program that ran for five years. There was rumored to be a sequel for years, and remained in development, but never happened. Fine by me. We got something better. It took fifteen years, but in 2011 it's said that the show will return to MTV with brand new episodes poking fun at music videos and viral videos. I'm skeptical, yet my excitement is through the roof. Beavis and Butthead Do America is about the two adolescents that go in search of their missing television set. Wandering into a motel, they become mistaken by a drunk named Muddy (Willis) as the men he hired to kill his wife. Saying he hired them to "do his wife," the boys believe they are being payed to have sex with Muddy's wife. The boys don't object, but then become labeled the most dangerous men in America by the FBI who are in search of a mysterious chip they call "the unit." The humor isn't as racy as people would expect. It maintains a PG-13 rating, and uses it neutrally. That comes off as one of its flaws, sadly. Like the South Park movie that boasted an R rating with very foul language and sex references, clearly showed what could be on the big screen differs greatly from Comedy Central. With Beavis and Butthead Do America, it does the same thing it would've done if it were a TV movie. Even The Simpson's Movie went a little further than its FOX limits. Still, it's worth it for the pleasure of seeing one of the greatest animated duos on the big screen doing what they do best, nothing. The best thing about the teens is they get in trouble, without even trying to get in trouble. They are a victim of bad timing, but somehow avoid every possible consequence. The FBI agent orders roadblocks, they are in the middle of the desert. They order the Dream America bus to stop, they get on a Nun's bus. My favorite scene is when their "peace'd out" teacher tries to tell them from the bottom of his heart that having no Television actually opens a window of opportunity. He claims people need to realize that we don't need TV to entertain us. After that very near and dear moment, all they pick up is "entert(ain us)." Beavis and Butthead Do America has gotten better with repeated viewings, but is seems it never was "boring." I think being young and dumb, the film didn't sit right with me for the reasons I stated above. After the third time, it was pretty cool. Starring: Mike Judge, Demi Moore, and Bruce Willis. Directed by: Mike Judge.

    I don't think Beavis and Butt Head Do America is quite as good as the wonderful TV show, but as far as a film based on a TV show goes, it is a worthy one and one of the better ones I've seen. It is a little too short and there are one or two scenes in the middle that could have done with a tighter pace. The animation is not quite as good as it is in the show, but it is still good and tries hard to stick to its style. The score is infectious and there is also a killer soundtrack. The characters are fun and likable and the story is funny, clever and well structured. The voices are also great, not just from the leads but also the celebrity voices. But the humour is what drives it, crude, vulgar and yes quite risqu&eacute; it is quite hilarious and sharp. All in all, a worthy film even if the TV show is better. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    I became a Beavis and Butt-head fanatic since it came on MTV, when this movie came out to theaters in 1996, I was thrilled and this movie made me laugh throughout the entire film!!! I was laughing like crazy. The films stars as a voice cast: Mike Judge (Beavis and Butt-head, Tom Anderson, Mr. Van Driessen, Principal McVicker), Bruce Willis (Muddy Grimes), Demi Moore (Dallas Grimes), Robert Stack (ATF Agent Flemming), etc. While awaking from a crazy dream, Beavis and Butt-head soon realize that their TV was stolen from a bunch of thieves, and they were mad, so its them on a journey across America to find their TV, not only that, someone is hold captive of a deadly device that belongs to the FBI, it can be found in Beavis's shorts. While searching for the TV, they stop a motel where Muddy Grimes (voice of Bruce Willis) wants them to get Dallas (voice of Demi Moore) back in relationship, elsewhere, they stop at Tom Anderson's trailer and they screwed up his TV, once they stop at Las Vegas, they found Dallas caught in a terrorist control. Chaos ensues when they mess around with the control panel of the Hoover Dam. While many places to go, they got lost in a desert with two Motley Crue roadies, after that, they nearly die from dehydration until Muddy came up to pick them up to get them to Washington DC. Once they get there, the agents are on the run of the unit. After that's taking care of, Tom Anderson, Muddy and Dallas Grimes were arrested and Beavis and Butt-head saved everybody from total chaos, finally, they found their TV lying on the motel sidewalk. This is classic Mike Judge at it's best, next to King of the Hill, and the movie Office Space. One of the funniest scenes in the movie is the Cornholio scene. I can laugh at that all night long. For a movie based cartoon film, it's 1,000,000 times better than that Spongebob Squarepants garbage. This movie is awesome, you'll laugh like there's no tomorrow. Beavis and Butt-head Do America gets 10 stars.
