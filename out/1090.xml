    This sexy thriller wasn't as interesting or well made as Basic instinct and is also some what silly that it has some funny moments though that being said I didn't find it terrible and Sharon Stone looks damn sexy in this at 35 years as a vulnerable woman moving to an apartment where a lady who looked like her was recently pushed from the window. We the audience are given 2 suspects who we believe may have been responsible for the fall Tom Berenger a kinda intense writer and William Baldwin a perverted horny landlord of the apartment who watches his tenants on television films. The film does manage some suspense and I thought the sex scenes were pretty good and probably not as explicit as some would expect so its not bad to watch at night time for a thriller film with erotics.

    If the sight of Sharon Stone and William Baldwin gyrating their way through a series of long and drawn-out sex scenes is appealing, then I'd recommend SLIVER, one in a wave of erotic thrillers that populated the mid-1990s in the wake of BASIC INSTINCT. For movie fans in general, though, SLIVER is a bit of a non-starter. The film's biggest flaw is an overly familiar script, which has an interesting premise involving voyeurism but does little with it (other than inviting the viewer to participate, a theme which has been done to death these days anyway). Sharon Stone moves into a high-tech apartment block where people are being murdered, and we're supposed to care about what happens next. There are flashes of interest and inspiration throughout, usually involving the supporting cast. Watching Tom Berenger chewing dialogue is always a delight, and ROME's Polly Walker shows up too, although sadly not for very long. The talents of CCH Pounder and Martin Landau also end up wasted in favour of dull, slightly wooden turns from Stone (who displays none of the charm and allure she essayed in BASIC INSTINCT) and a sweaty, unpleasant Baldwin. The thriller aspects are unevenly handled, and Aussie director Philip Noyce (who directed DEAD CALM, one of my favourite thrillers) drops the ball more than once, failing to elicit suspense from scenarios which should be tense and atmospheric. SLIVER isn't all bad; the most undemanding of movie fans might even enjoy it, but I'm afraid I've been here way too many times to see anything even remotely interesting.

    'Sliver' is easily one of the worst entries in Sharon Stone's filmography. Written by a Joe Eszterhas - the genius who gave us 'Basic Instinct' (which obviously made Sharon famous) the film lacks to deliver. It's suppose to be a tense thriller but there is nothing tense about it. Whole thing lasts for almost 2 hours and is horribly boring for the most of it. Sharon Stone gives a decent performance as she always does but she's very, very far from her top. It's not 'Basic Instinct', hell It's even far from 'Year of the Gun'. William Baldwin is annoying as usual but he does his 'creepo' part quite OK. It was nice to see Tom Berenger, he was probably the best thing about the movie, his acting was kinda memorable so was his character. If you are looking for a tense, erotic thriller, you will be disappointed. It plays better as a drama, there is no suspense, no action, no real twists, nothing you would be excited about. 'Sliver' is barely watchable once. Do yourself a favor and pick the better choice.

    Sharon Stone plays a book editor who moves into a luxury apartment block named "Sliver" vacated by a woman who "mysteriously" fell to her death from her balcony. Also mysteriously someone is watching her (and everybody else in the apartment block) with top-notch technology and following every moment whatever they are doing. William Baldwin and Polly Walker star as the neighbours and Tom Berenger stars a novelist who tries to romance Stone. Then follows the tedious attempts at the eroticism it advertises and desperately trying to create mystery, thrills and drama but the plot just witters into boring romps and dirty talk and tries to rush the drama back in. Sharon Stone and Tom Berenger are criminally wasted here despite their efforts while William Baldwin and Polly Walker are woeful. Based a novel of the same name but obviously trying to cash in Sharon Stone's success with the previous year's Basic Instinct, director Philip Noyce and screenplay writer Joe Eszterhas don't give much material to work from and it could have been much better if more carefully handled. Don't bother unless you fancy a moan like me.

    The idea of Sliver is unique and was never done before esp by the time it was released which was the early 1990s . by then the audience were sick and tired of seeing people with gloves killing someone and they wanted new approaches to crime thrillers , the director has ruined the idea of the film by the narrow view of stone as a sex symbol and how everyone wants to sleep with her . he could have made it more interesting by adding the element of surprise like not knowing who is watching these people on video or by adding a twist to the story of the man who sleeps with his little girl. also by hiring more sophisticated male actors unlike Baldwin who came across as immature and clich&eacute;d .Berenger didn't add any dramatic effect to the plot ,and looked like he was doing a cigarettes ad metaphorically speaking . Stone seemed cold and very controlled by the director' s narrow vision of the film and how he was keen on making another sex themed thriller like basic instinct instead of concentrating on the great potentials Sliver would have . the ending was very disappointing and forgettable . all in all the director had the chance of a life time to make a great classic thriller where people would think twice before they do anything because someone might be watching , but instead he went after cheap sex scenes and a predictable plot. it is worth watching after all just to see how Stone was coping with massive success of Basic instinct which led her to make the wrong choice because she was under pressure to stay the Hollywood sex symbol .

    I waited 18 years to see this movie because I had always heard how terrible it is. When it first came out, I seem to recall thinking it highly implausible that someone could have the kind of video and audio equipment you see in this movie. But the equipment and its use in the film is entirely plausible, even in 1993. I found no problems with the plot. It's an interesting thriller with something that's hard to find--a unique story that hasn't been told a thousand times already. The acting is good. The characters and their actions are completely believable. I was never left thinking that a real person might not have done the things that the people in the movie did. Having seen the movie, I really don't understand why so many people criticize it so harshly. In terms of telling a compelling, entertaining story, I would say it is far better than movies like Hereafter and on par with a movie like the Adjustment Bureau (just two recent movies I could think to compare it to). If you haven't seen it, give it a chance.

    Looks like a cross between a subject novelist Levin had always broached in "Rosemary's baby" (the building where horrible things happen;beware of neighbors!) and "rear window" (voyeurism:the telescope James Stewart used in Hitchcock's classic ;the 'improvement" in Baldwin's apartment) The parts of the two male principals have been changed in comparison with Levin's novel and Tom Berenger is not given a single chance to shine ;the new screenplay does not make much sense ,considering the wealthy spoilt child's behavior and obsession with his fellow men's life ;more than the hot scenes,the best is this real "sitcom" the boy is watching all day long ;considering today's TV ,the movie was ahead of its time for that matter. Levin's novel was not in the same league as "Rosemary's baby" ,"a kiss before dying" or even "the Stepford wives" ;but it was more interesting than later horrors such as "son of Rosemary" and the director did not make the best of it. =

    Sliver starts out fine, but it ages like milk, and by the end, it kind of stinks Dumb would be the easiest way to label Sliver, but to be more specific, I would call it immature. This is the kind of material where high profile people have low profile brains, resulting in a motion picture which intends to be dramatic by relying almost entirely on characters doing and saying vulgar, improper things: icky flirting, gratuitous sex and biggest of all, invading the privacy of others. Voyeurism is the main topic here. Having its roots Hitchcock, Sliver tries to take the peeping tom effect to the highest high it seems. Director Phillip Noyce sells it to us well visually, but he is unable to use it effectively as a plot device or for suspense. The cast are unable to perform with solidity, the story is unable to achieve focus, and the end product is not recommendable, even for those who get off on erotic thrillers. Try looking somewhere else.

    For long time, Basic Instinct and Sliver were two movies that I avoided watching. The general talk around me about these two movies was that both starred Sharon Stone and the primary theme of the movie was sex. But somewhere as time passed, I ended up giving the movie "Basic Instinct" a try and realized that in spite of being loaded with steamy sex scenes, the movie still had a story and some substance. There was indeed a lot of confusion throughout the movie which makes you wonder what happens next and maybe lay down a bet to predict the end of the movie. What I am trying to say is that, the movie is enjoyable, not for the sex but more so for the story and the element of thrill. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about this movie "Sliver", which I ended up watching in the hope that maybe people were wrong (as in case of Basic Instinct) that this movie was just sex. And yes, because the story is hardly gripping, the movie does end up being a movie which is all about sex. I was severely disappointed with this movie. The story line did not impress me much and Sharon Stone's character was annoying to say the least. Hardly anything in her character that you can like or sympathize. Nothing! Very shallow! The movie centers around an apartment owned by a pervert with money enough to wire the whole apartment with cameras so that he can watch everyone doing anything and I mean it - anything. The story (if there is something called a story) is lame. It follows how Sharon's character eventually finds this out and how she deals with this discovery and blah blah blah! A very predictable end once you are through to the last forty minutes of the movie. Of course, that does not mean, the earlier part is interesting. It is just a pervert's dream come true and nothing else. All and all, I can say that this is one of the movies you can safely avoid. Even a bad movie, I say to people, go and watch so that you know it is bad. But here is a movie, I can say, there is no need to even watch. You will not be missing anything. And if you are Sharon Stone's fans, well, I don't know what to say. I guess there is nothing much I can say. Overall, disappointing.

    Granted, the idea of the voyeur that sleeps in all of could provide interesting film material. Providing a potent cast including a leading role for foxy Sharon Stone who doesn't scant with female charms should only make this material more worthwhile. Even so, "Sliver" of 1993 is a barely mediocre film that does not nearly reach the high standards of mystery and suspense it seems to think. Comparisons with "Basic Instinct" (1992) are obvious, as both films are early 90s erotic thrillers from the sleazy mind of Joe Esterhas, and both films star sexy Sharon Stone on the peak of her career. Yet, "Sliver" is far less interesting a film. Not because the script is weaker, but mainly because this is a lot tamer than the scandalous "Basic Instinct", and because there are several periods of mere boredom in-between. This may be due to the fact that Philip Noyce, who is responsible for unmemorable films like "The Saint" and "Patriot Games", is certainly no director comparable to Paul Verhoeven, one of the few directors who successfully mix Exploitation cinema with Blockbuster budgets, most successfully with "Basic Instinct" and films like "Robo Cop", "Total Recall", "Flesh+Blood" or "Showgirls". The character Stone plays here is the total opposite to the Femme Fatale she played in "Basic Insinct". Stone plays Carly Norris, a beautiful and successful writer of biographies, who has become vulnerable and insecure ever since splitting from her boyfriend. She moves into the posh Manhattan apartment complex Sliver heights. The former tenant, a woman who had an amazing resemblance to Carly is supposed to have killed herself - only that in reality, it was someone else who threw her off her 13th floor balcony. And someone is watching the house's tenants via hidden cameras... In case you haven't seen the film, don't read on. ***WARNING! BIG SPOILERS AHEAD!*** What I disliked most about "Sliver" is the fact that it tries to be unpredictable, but is predictable all the way. From the beginning, we can see that somebody is watching the tenants 24/7, and it is clear that a murderer is on the loose. Several characters are introduced, and it is quite clear who is responsible for what. When moving into the apartment complex, sexy Sharon meets the handsome and friendly Zeke (William Baldwin) and it's immediately clear that there's a sexual tension between the two. Carly falls for Zeke, and at the latest when Zeke confesses to Carly that he is the owner of the house, it is clear who has been watching her take a shower on a silver screen. Then there's a sleazy and self-centered writer played by Tom Berenger. The guy basically has 'MANIAC' written all over him, and... Surprise!... Now I Would not call "Sliver" a complete failure. The film has some interesting points and the assumption that the voyeur is in all of us is quite well-illustrated. Sharon stone is stunningly beautiful in this film, and she also delivers a great performance. Seeing sexy Sharon bare it is sufficient reason to watch the film, and yet, she did so far more explicitly in "Basic Instinct" a year earlier. The supporting cast includes the great Martin Landau, and sexy young Polly Walker, who is most famous for her recent role of the ueber-intriguer Attia of the Julii on HBO's brilliant mini-series "Rome". Tom Berenger is typecast as a sleazy scumbag, and William Baldwin is convincing as the rich playboy with the sleazy hobby. - And yet, it is not really convincing at all. The film is full of inconsistencies. At one point, Zeke threatens a guy on the phone for molesting his stepdaughter. Would a man who spends his time secretly watching the tenants of an apartment complex in intimate situations really care? And even if he did, would he take any risks to be discovered? I don't think so, and this is only one of many illogical things about the film. What I, as a Horror fan, found interesting was the fact that the murders are very much in the style of Italian 70s Gialli. Director Noyce obviously let Horror's most intriguing sub-genre, the wonderful Giallo, serve as an inspiration here. Overall, "Sliver" is mildly entertaining for its exploration of voyeurism, and for satisfying the viewer's voyeurism by providing female eye-candy in form of sexy leading lady Sharon Stone. As a mystery, however, it fails. If you do, watch it for Sharon's boobies.

    For long time, Basic Instinct and Sliver were two movies that I avoided watching. The general talk around me about these two movies was that both starred Sharon Stone and the primary theme of the movie was sex. But somewhere as time passed, I ended up giving the movie "Basic Instinct" a try and realized that in spite of being loaded with steamy sex scenes, the movie still had a story and some substance. There was indeed a lot of confusion throughout the movie which makes you wonder what happens next and maybe lay down a bet to predict the end of the movie. What I am trying to say is that, the movie is enjoyable, not for the sex but more so for the story and the element of thrill. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about this movie "Sliver", which I ended up watching in the hope that maybe people were wrong (as in case of Basic Instinct) that this movie was just sex. And yes, because the story is hardly gripping, the movie does end up being a movie which is all about sex. I was severely disappointed with this movie. The story line did not impress me much and Sharon Stone's character was annoying to say the least. Hardly anything in her character that you can like or sympathize. Nothing! Very shallow! The movie centers around an apartment owned by a pervert with money enough to wire the whole apartment with cameras so that he can watch everyone doing anything and I mean it - anything. The story (if there is something called a story) is lame. It follows how Sharon's character eventually finds this out and how she deals with this discovery and blah blah blah! A very predictable end once you are through to the last forty minutes of the movie. Of course, that does not mean, the earlier part is interesting. It is just a pervert's dream come true and nothing else. All and all, I can say that this is one of the movies you can safely avoid. Even a bad movie, I say to people, go and watch so that you know it is bad. But here is a movie, I can say, there is no need to even watch. You will not be missing anything. And if you are Sharon Stone's fans, well, I don't know what to say. I guess there is nothing much I can say. Overall, disappointing.

    Granted, the idea of the voyeur that sleeps in all of could provide interesting film material. Providing a potent cast including a leading role for foxy Sharon Stone who doesn't scant with female charms should only make this material more worthwhile. Even so, "Sliver" of 1993 is a barely mediocre film that does not nearly reach the high standards of mystery and suspense it seems to think. Comparisons with "Basic Instinct" (1992) are obvious, as both films are early 90s erotic thrillers from the sleazy mind of Joe Esterhas, and both films star sexy Sharon Stone on the peak of her career. Yet, "Sliver" is far less interesting a film. Not because the script is weaker, but mainly because this is a lot tamer than the scandalous "Basic Instinct", and because there are several periods of mere boredom in-between. This may be due to the fact that Philip Noyce, who is responsible for unmemorable films like "The Saint" and "Patriot Games", is certainly no director comparable to Paul Verhoeven, one of the few directors who successfully mix Exploitation cinema with Blockbuster budgets, most successfully with "Basic Instinct" and films like "Robo Cop", "Total Recall", "Flesh+Blood" or "Showgirls". The character Stone plays here is the total opposite to the Femme Fatale she played in "Basic Insinct". Stone plays Carly Norris, a beautiful and successful writer of biographies, who has become vulnerable and insecure ever since splitting from her boyfriend. She moves into the posh Manhattan apartment complex Sliver heights. The former tenant, a woman who had an amazing resemblance to Carly is supposed to have killed herself - only that in reality, it was someone else who threw her off her 13th floor balcony. And someone is watching the house's tenants via hidden cameras... In case you haven't seen the film, don't read on. ***WARNING! BIG SPOILERS AHEAD!*** What I disliked most about "Sliver" is the fact that it tries to be unpredictable, but is predictable all the way. From the beginning, we can see that somebody is watching the tenants 24/7, and it is clear that a murderer is on the loose. Several characters are introduced, and it is quite clear who is responsible for what. When moving into the apartment complex, sexy Sharon meets the handsome and friendly Zeke (William Baldwin) and it's immediately clear that there's a sexual tension between the two. Carly falls for Zeke, and at the latest when Zeke confesses to Carly that he is the owner of the house, it is clear who has been watching her take a shower on a silver screen. Then there's a sleazy and self-centered writer played by Tom Berenger. The guy basically has 'MANIAC' written all over him, and... Surprise!... Now I Would not call "Sliver" a complete failure. The film has some interesting points and the assumption that the voyeur is in all of us is quite well-illustrated. Sharon stone is stunningly beautiful in this film, and she also delivers a great performance. Seeing sexy Sharon bare it is sufficient reason to watch the film, and yet, she did so far more explicitly in "Basic Instinct" a year earlier. The supporting cast includes the great Martin Landau, and sexy young Polly Walker, who is most famous for her recent role of the ueber-intriguer Attia of the Julii on HBO's brilliant mini-series "Rome". Tom Berenger is typecast as a sleazy scumbag, and William Baldwin is convincing as the rich playboy with the sleazy hobby. - And yet, it is not really convincing at all. The film is full of inconsistencies. At one point, Zeke threatens a guy on the phone for molesting his stepdaughter. Would a man who spends his time secretly watching the tenants of an apartment complex in intimate situations really care? And even if he did, would he take any risks to be discovered? I don't think so, and this is only one of many illogical things about the film. What I, as a Horror fan, found interesting was the fact that the murders are very much in the style of Italian 70s Gialli. Director Noyce obviously let Horror's most intriguing sub-genre, the wonderful Giallo, serve as an inspiration here. Overall, "Sliver" is mildly entertaining for its exploration of voyeurism, and for satisfying the viewer's voyeurism by providing female eye-candy in form of sexy leading lady Sharon Stone. As a mystery, however, it fails. If you do, watch it for Sharon's boobies.

    This sexy thriller wasn't as interesting or well made as Basic instinct and is also some what silly that it has some funny moments though that being said I didn't find it terrible and Sharon Stone looks damn sexy in this at 35 years as a vulnerable woman moving to an apartment where a lady who looked like her was recently pushed from the window. We the audience are given 2 suspects who we believe may have been responsible for the fall Tom Berenger a kinda intense writer and William Baldwin a perverted horny landlord of the apartment who watches his tenants on television films. The film does manage some suspense and I thought the sex scenes were pretty good and probably not as explicit as some would expect so its not bad to watch at night time for a thriller film with erotics.

    If the sight of Sharon Stone and William Baldwin gyrating their way through a series of long and drawn-out sex scenes is appealing, then I'd recommend SLIVER, one in a wave of erotic thrillers that populated the mid-1990s in the wake of BASIC INSTINCT. For movie fans in general, though, SLIVER is a bit of a non-starter. The film's biggest flaw is an overly familiar script, which has an interesting premise involving voyeurism but does little with it (other than inviting the viewer to participate, a theme which has been done to death these days anyway). Sharon Stone moves into a high-tech apartment block where people are being murdered, and we're supposed to care about what happens next. There are flashes of interest and inspiration throughout, usually involving the supporting cast. Watching Tom Berenger chewing dialogue is always a delight, and ROME's Polly Walker shows up too, although sadly not for very long. The talents of CCH Pounder and Martin Landau also end up wasted in favour of dull, slightly wooden turns from Stone (who displays none of the charm and allure she essayed in BASIC INSTINCT) and a sweaty, unpleasant Baldwin. The thriller aspects are unevenly handled, and Aussie director Philip Noyce (who directed DEAD CALM, one of my favourite thrillers) drops the ball more than once, failing to elicit suspense from scenarios which should be tense and atmospheric. SLIVER isn't all bad; the most undemanding of movie fans might even enjoy it, but I'm afraid I've been here way too many times to see anything even remotely interesting.

    'Sliver' is easily one of the worst entries in Sharon Stone's filmography. Written by a Joe Eszterhas - the genius who gave us 'Basic Instinct' (which obviously made Sharon famous) the film lacks to deliver. It's suppose to be a tense thriller but there is nothing tense about it. Whole thing lasts for almost 2 hours and is horribly boring for the most of it. Sharon Stone gives a decent performance as she always does but she's very, very far from her top. It's not 'Basic Instinct', hell It's even far from 'Year of the Gun'. William Baldwin is annoying as usual but he does his 'creepo' part quite OK. It was nice to see Tom Berenger, he was probably the best thing about the movie, his acting was kinda memorable so was his character. If you are looking for a tense, erotic thriller, you will be disappointed. It plays better as a drama, there is no suspense, no action, no real twists, nothing you would be excited about. 'Sliver' is barely watchable once. Do yourself a favor and pick the better choice.

    Sharon Stone plays a book editor who moves into a luxury apartment block named "Sliver" vacated by a woman who "mysteriously" fell to her death from her balcony. Also mysteriously someone is watching her (and everybody else in the apartment block) with top-notch technology and following every moment whatever they are doing. William Baldwin and Polly Walker star as the neighbours and Tom Berenger stars a novelist who tries to romance Stone. Then follows the tedious attempts at the eroticism it advertises and desperately trying to create mystery, thrills and drama but the plot just witters into boring romps and dirty talk and tries to rush the drama back in. Sharon Stone and Tom Berenger are criminally wasted here despite their efforts while William Baldwin and Polly Walker are woeful. Based a novel of the same name but obviously trying to cash in Sharon Stone's success with the previous year's Basic Instinct, director Philip Noyce and screenplay writer Joe Eszterhas don't give much material to work from and it could have been much better if more carefully handled. Don't bother unless you fancy a moan like me.

    The idea of Sliver is unique and was never done before esp by the time it was released which was the early 1990s . by then the audience were sick and tired of seeing people with gloves killing someone and they wanted new approaches to crime thrillers , the director has ruined the idea of the film by the narrow view of stone as a sex symbol and how everyone wants to sleep with her . he could have made it more interesting by adding the element of surprise like not knowing who is watching these people on video or by adding a twist to the story of the man who sleeps with his little girl. also by hiring more sophisticated male actors unlike Baldwin who came across as immature and clich&eacute;d .Berenger didn't add any dramatic effect to the plot ,and looked like he was doing a cigarettes ad metaphorically speaking . Stone seemed cold and very controlled by the director' s narrow vision of the film and how he was keen on making another sex themed thriller like basic instinct instead of concentrating on the great potentials Sliver would have . the ending was very disappointing and forgettable . all in all the director had the chance of a life time to make a great classic thriller where people would think twice before they do anything because someone might be watching , but instead he went after cheap sex scenes and a predictable plot. it is worth watching after all just to see how Stone was coping with massive success of Basic instinct which led her to make the wrong choice because she was under pressure to stay the Hollywood sex symbol .

    I waited 18 years to see this movie because I had always heard how terrible it is. When it first came out, I seem to recall thinking it highly implausible that someone could have the kind of video and audio equipment you see in this movie. But the equipment and its use in the film is entirely plausible, even in 1993. I found no problems with the plot. It's an interesting thriller with something that's hard to find--a unique story that hasn't been told a thousand times already. The acting is good. The characters and their actions are completely believable. I was never left thinking that a real person might not have done the things that the people in the movie did. Having seen the movie, I really don't understand why so many people criticize it so harshly. In terms of telling a compelling, entertaining story, I would say it is far better than movies like Hereafter and on par with a movie like the Adjustment Bureau (just two recent movies I could think to compare it to). If you haven't seen it, give it a chance.

    Looks like a cross between a subject novelist Levin had always broached in "Rosemary's baby" (the building where horrible things happen;beware of neighbors!) and "rear window" (voyeurism:the telescope James Stewart used in Hitchcock's classic ;the 'improvement" in Baldwin's apartment) The parts of the two male principals have been changed in comparison with Levin's novel and Tom Berenger is not given a single chance to shine ;the new screenplay does not make much sense ,considering the wealthy spoilt child's behavior and obsession with his fellow men's life ;more than the hot scenes,the best is this real "sitcom" the boy is watching all day long ;considering today's TV ,the movie was ahead of its time for that matter. Levin's novel was not in the same league as "Rosemary's baby" ,"a kiss before dying" or even "the Stepford wives" ;but it was more interesting than later horrors such as "son of Rosemary" and the director did not make the best of it. =

    Sliver starts out fine, but it ages like milk, and by the end, it kind of stinks Dumb would be the easiest way to label Sliver, but to be more specific, I would call it immature. This is the kind of material where high profile people have low profile brains, resulting in a motion picture which intends to be dramatic by relying almost entirely on characters doing and saying vulgar, improper things: icky flirting, gratuitous sex and biggest of all, invading the privacy of others. Voyeurism is the main topic here. Having its roots Hitchcock, Sliver tries to take the peeping tom effect to the highest high it seems. Director Phillip Noyce sells it to us well visually, but he is unable to use it effectively as a plot device or for suspense. The cast are unable to perform with solidity, the story is unable to achieve focus, and the end product is not recommendable, even for those who get off on erotic thrillers. Try looking somewhere else.

    I waited 18 years to see this movie because I had always heard how terrible it is. When it first came out, I seem to recall thinking it highly implausible that someone could have the kind of video and audio equipment you see in this movie. But the equipment and its use in the film is entirely plausible, even in 1993. I found no problems with the plot. It's an interesting thriller with something that's hard to find--a unique story that hasn't been told a thousand times already. The acting is good. The characters and their actions are completely believable. I was never left thinking that a real person might not have done the things that the people in the movie did. Having seen the movie, I really don't understand why so many people criticize it so harshly. In terms of telling a compelling, entertaining story, I would say it is far better than movies like Hereafter and on par with a movie like the Adjustment Bureau (just two recent movies I could think to compare it to). If you haven't seen it, give it a chance.

    Looks like a cross between a subject novelist Levin had always broached in "Rosemary's baby" (the building where horrible things happen;beware of neighbors!) and "rear window" (voyeurism:the telescope James Stewart used in Hitchcock's classic ;the 'improvement" in Baldwin's apartment) The parts of the two male principals have been changed in comparison with Levin's novel and Tom Berenger is not given a single chance to shine ;the new screenplay does not make much sense ,considering the wealthy spoilt child's behavior and obsession with his fellow men's life ;more than the hot scenes,the best is this real "sitcom" the boy is watching all day long ;considering today's TV ,the movie was ahead of its time for that matter. Levin's novel was not in the same league as "Rosemary's baby" ,"a kiss before dying" or even "the Stepford wives" ;but it was more interesting than later horrors such as "son of Rosemary" and the director did not make the best of it. =

    Sliver starts out fine, but it ages like milk, and by the end, it kind of stinks Dumb would be the easiest way to label Sliver, but to be more specific, I would call it immature. This is the kind of material where high profile people have low profile brains, resulting in a motion picture which intends to be dramatic by relying almost entirely on characters doing and saying vulgar, improper things: icky flirting, gratuitous sex and biggest of all, invading the privacy of others. Voyeurism is the main topic here. Having its roots Hitchcock, Sliver tries to take the peeping tom effect to the highest high it seems. Director Phillip Noyce sells it to us well visually, but he is unable to use it effectively as a plot device or for suspense. The cast are unable to perform with solidity, the story is unable to achieve focus, and the end product is not recommendable, even for those who get off on erotic thrillers. Try looking somewhere else.

    For long time, Basic Instinct and Sliver were two movies that I avoided watching. The general talk around me about these two movies was that both starred Sharon Stone and the primary theme of the movie was sex. But somewhere as time passed, I ended up giving the movie "Basic Instinct" a try and realized that in spite of being loaded with steamy sex scenes, the movie still had a story and some substance. There was indeed a lot of confusion throughout the movie which makes you wonder what happens next and maybe lay down a bet to predict the end of the movie. What I am trying to say is that, the movie is enjoyable, not for the sex but more so for the story and the element of thrill. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about this movie "Sliver", which I ended up watching in the hope that maybe people were wrong (as in case of Basic Instinct) that this movie was just sex. And yes, because the story is hardly gripping, the movie does end up being a movie which is all about sex. I was severely disappointed with this movie. The story line did not impress me much and Sharon Stone's character was annoying to say the least. Hardly anything in her character that you can like or sympathize. Nothing! Very shallow! The movie centers around an apartment owned by a pervert with money enough to wire the whole apartment with cameras so that he can watch everyone doing anything and I mean it - anything. The story (if there is something called a story) is lame. It follows how Sharon's character eventually finds this out and how she deals with this discovery and blah blah blah! A very predictable end once you are through to the last forty minutes of the movie. Of course, that does not mean, the earlier part is interesting. It is just a pervert's dream come true and nothing else. All and all, I can say that this is one of the movies you can safely avoid. Even a bad movie, I say to people, go and watch so that you know it is bad. But here is a movie, I can say, there is no need to even watch. You will not be missing anything. And if you are Sharon Stone's fans, well, I don't know what to say. I guess there is nothing much I can say. Overall, disappointing.

    Granted, the idea of the voyeur that sleeps in all of could provide interesting film material. Providing a potent cast including a leading role for foxy Sharon Stone who doesn't scant with female charms should only make this material more worthwhile. Even so, "Sliver" of 1993 is a barely mediocre film that does not nearly reach the high standards of mystery and suspense it seems to think. Comparisons with "Basic Instinct" (1992) are obvious, as both films are early 90s erotic thrillers from the sleazy mind of Joe Esterhas, and both films star sexy Sharon Stone on the peak of her career. Yet, "Sliver" is far less interesting a film. Not because the script is weaker, but mainly because this is a lot tamer than the scandalous "Basic Instinct", and because there are several periods of mere boredom in-between. This may be due to the fact that Philip Noyce, who is responsible for unmemorable films like "The Saint" and "Patriot Games", is certainly no director comparable to Paul Verhoeven, one of the few directors who successfully mix Exploitation cinema with Blockbuster budgets, most successfully with "Basic Instinct" and films like "Robo Cop", "Total Recall", "Flesh+Blood" or "Showgirls". The character Stone plays here is the total opposite to the Femme Fatale she played in "Basic Insinct". Stone plays Carly Norris, a beautiful and successful writer of biographies, who has become vulnerable and insecure ever since splitting from her boyfriend. She moves into the posh Manhattan apartment complex Sliver heights. The former tenant, a woman who had an amazing resemblance to Carly is supposed to have killed herself - only that in reality, it was someone else who threw her off her 13th floor balcony. And someone is watching the house's tenants via hidden cameras... In case you haven't seen the film, don't read on. ***WARNING! BIG SPOILERS AHEAD!*** What I disliked most about "Sliver" is the fact that it tries to be unpredictable, but is predictable all the way. From the beginning, we can see that somebody is watching the tenants 24/7, and it is clear that a murderer is on the loose. Several characters are introduced, and it is quite clear who is responsible for what. When moving into the apartment complex, sexy Sharon meets the handsome and friendly Zeke (William Baldwin) and it's immediately clear that there's a sexual tension between the two. Carly falls for Zeke, and at the latest when Zeke confesses to Carly that he is the owner of the house, it is clear who has been watching her take a shower on a silver screen. Then there's a sleazy and self-centered writer played by Tom Berenger. The guy basically has 'MANIAC' written all over him, and... Surprise!... Now I Would not call "Sliver" a complete failure. The film has some interesting points and the assumption that the voyeur is in all of us is quite well-illustrated. Sharon stone is stunningly beautiful in this film, and she also delivers a great performance. Seeing sexy Sharon bare it is sufficient reason to watch the film, and yet, she did so far more explicitly in "Basic Instinct" a year earlier. The supporting cast includes the great Martin Landau, and sexy young Polly Walker, who is most famous for her recent role of the ueber-intriguer Attia of the Julii on HBO's brilliant mini-series "Rome". Tom Berenger is typecast as a sleazy scumbag, and William Baldwin is convincing as the rich playboy with the sleazy hobby. - And yet, it is not really convincing at all. The film is full of inconsistencies. At one point, Zeke threatens a guy on the phone for molesting his stepdaughter. Would a man who spends his time secretly watching the tenants of an apartment complex in intimate situations really care? And even if he did, would he take any risks to be discovered? I don't think so, and this is only one of many illogical things about the film. What I, as a Horror fan, found interesting was the fact that the murders are very much in the style of Italian 70s Gialli. Director Noyce obviously let Horror's most intriguing sub-genre, the wonderful Giallo, serve as an inspiration here. Overall, "Sliver" is mildly entertaining for its exploration of voyeurism, and for satisfying the viewer's voyeurism by providing female eye-candy in form of sexy leading lady Sharon Stone. As a mystery, however, it fails. If you do, watch it for Sharon's boobies.

    This sexy thriller wasn't as interesting or well made as Basic instinct and is also some what silly that it has some funny moments though that being said I didn't find it terrible and Sharon Stone looks damn sexy in this at 35 years as a vulnerable woman moving to an apartment where a lady who looked like her was recently pushed from the window. We the audience are given 2 suspects who we believe may have been responsible for the fall Tom Berenger a kinda intense writer and William Baldwin a perverted horny landlord of the apartment who watches his tenants on television films. The film does manage some suspense and I thought the sex scenes were pretty good and probably not as explicit as some would expect so its not bad to watch at night time for a thriller film with erotics.

    If the sight of Sharon Stone and William Baldwin gyrating their way through a series of long and drawn-out sex scenes is appealing, then I'd recommend SLIVER, one in a wave of erotic thrillers that populated the mid-1990s in the wake of BASIC INSTINCT. For movie fans in general, though, SLIVER is a bit of a non-starter. The film's biggest flaw is an overly familiar script, which has an interesting premise involving voyeurism but does little with it (other than inviting the viewer to participate, a theme which has been done to death these days anyway). Sharon Stone moves into a high-tech apartment block where people are being murdered, and we're supposed to care about what happens next. There are flashes of interest and inspiration throughout, usually involving the supporting cast. Watching Tom Berenger chewing dialogue is always a delight, and ROME's Polly Walker shows up too, although sadly not for very long. The talents of CCH Pounder and Martin Landau also end up wasted in favour of dull, slightly wooden turns from Stone (who displays none of the charm and allure she essayed in BASIC INSTINCT) and a sweaty, unpleasant Baldwin. The thriller aspects are unevenly handled, and Aussie director Philip Noyce (who directed DEAD CALM, one of my favourite thrillers) drops the ball more than once, failing to elicit suspense from scenarios which should be tense and atmospheric. SLIVER isn't all bad; the most undemanding of movie fans might even enjoy it, but I'm afraid I've been here way too many times to see anything even remotely interesting.

    'Sliver' is easily one of the worst entries in Sharon Stone's filmography. Written by a Joe Eszterhas - the genius who gave us 'Basic Instinct' (which obviously made Sharon famous) the film lacks to deliver. It's suppose to be a tense thriller but there is nothing tense about it. Whole thing lasts for almost 2 hours and is horribly boring for the most of it. Sharon Stone gives a decent performance as she always does but she's very, very far from her top. It's not 'Basic Instinct', hell It's even far from 'Year of the Gun'. William Baldwin is annoying as usual but he does his 'creepo' part quite OK. It was nice to see Tom Berenger, he was probably the best thing about the movie, his acting was kinda memorable so was his character. If you are looking for a tense, erotic thriller, you will be disappointed. It plays better as a drama, there is no suspense, no action, no real twists, nothing you would be excited about. 'Sliver' is barely watchable once. Do yourself a favor and pick the better choice.

    Sharon Stone plays a book editor who moves into a luxury apartment block named "Sliver" vacated by a woman who "mysteriously" fell to her death from her balcony. Also mysteriously someone is watching her (and everybody else in the apartment block) with top-notch technology and following every moment whatever they are doing. William Baldwin and Polly Walker star as the neighbours and Tom Berenger stars a novelist who tries to romance Stone. Then follows the tedious attempts at the eroticism it advertises and desperately trying to create mystery, thrills and drama but the plot just witters into boring romps and dirty talk and tries to rush the drama back in. Sharon Stone and Tom Berenger are criminally wasted here despite their efforts while William Baldwin and Polly Walker are woeful. Based a novel of the same name but obviously trying to cash in Sharon Stone's success with the previous year's Basic Instinct, director Philip Noyce and screenplay writer Joe Eszterhas don't give much material to work from and it could have been much better if more carefully handled. Don't bother unless you fancy a moan like me.

    The idea of Sliver is unique and was never done before esp by the time it was released which was the early 1990s . by then the audience were sick and tired of seeing people with gloves killing someone and they wanted new approaches to crime thrillers , the director has ruined the idea of the film by the narrow view of stone as a sex symbol and how everyone wants to sleep with her . he could have made it more interesting by adding the element of surprise like not knowing who is watching these people on video or by adding a twist to the story of the man who sleeps with his little girl. also by hiring more sophisticated male actors unlike Baldwin who came across as immature and clich&eacute;d .Berenger didn't add any dramatic effect to the plot ,and looked like he was doing a cigarettes ad metaphorically speaking . Stone seemed cold and very controlled by the director' s narrow vision of the film and how he was keen on making another sex themed thriller like basic instinct instead of concentrating on the great potentials Sliver would have . the ending was very disappointing and forgettable . all in all the director had the chance of a life time to make a great classic thriller where people would think twice before they do anything because someone might be watching , but instead he went after cheap sex scenes and a predictable plot. it is worth watching after all just to see how Stone was coping with massive success of Basic instinct which led her to make the wrong choice because she was under pressure to stay the Hollywood sex symbol .

    'Sliver' is easily one of the worst entries in Sharon Stone's filmography. Written by a Joe Eszterhas - the genius who gave us 'Basic Instinct' (which obviously made Sharon famous) the film lacks to deliver. It's suppose to be a tense thriller but there is nothing tense about it. Whole thing lasts for almost 2 hours and is horribly boring for the most of it. Sharon Stone gives a decent performance as she always does but she's very, very far from her top. It's not 'Basic Instinct', hell It's even far from 'Year of the Gun'. William Baldwin is annoying as usual but he does his 'creepo' part quite OK. It was nice to see Tom Berenger, he was probably the best thing about the movie, his acting was kinda memorable so was his character. If you are looking for a tense, erotic thriller, you will be disappointed. It plays better as a drama, there is no suspense, no action, no real twists, nothing you would be excited about. 'Sliver' is barely watchable once. Do yourself a favor and pick the better choice.

    Sharon Stone plays a book editor who moves into a luxury apartment block named "Sliver" vacated by a woman who "mysteriously" fell to her death from her balcony. Also mysteriously someone is watching her (and everybody else in the apartment block) with top-notch technology and following every moment whatever they are doing. William Baldwin and Polly Walker star as the neighbours and Tom Berenger stars a novelist who tries to romance Stone. Then follows the tedious attempts at the eroticism it advertises and desperately trying to create mystery, thrills and drama but the plot just witters into boring romps and dirty talk and tries to rush the drama back in. Sharon Stone and Tom Berenger are criminally wasted here despite their efforts while William Baldwin and Polly Walker are woeful. Based a novel of the same name but obviously trying to cash in Sharon Stone's success with the previous year's Basic Instinct, director Philip Noyce and screenplay writer Joe Eszterhas don't give much material to work from and it could have been much better if more carefully handled. Don't bother unless you fancy a moan like me.

    The idea of Sliver is unique and was never done before esp by the time it was released which was the early 1990s . by then the audience were sick and tired of seeing people with gloves killing someone and they wanted new approaches to crime thrillers , the director has ruined the idea of the film by the narrow view of stone as a sex symbol and how everyone wants to sleep with her . he could have made it more interesting by adding the element of surprise like not knowing who is watching these people on video or by adding a twist to the story of the man who sleeps with his little girl. also by hiring more sophisticated male actors unlike Baldwin who came across as immature and clich&eacute;d .Berenger didn't add any dramatic effect to the plot ,and looked like he was doing a cigarettes ad metaphorically speaking . Stone seemed cold and very controlled by the director' s narrow vision of the film and how he was keen on making another sex themed thriller like basic instinct instead of concentrating on the great potentials Sliver would have . the ending was very disappointing and forgettable . all in all the director had the chance of a life time to make a great classic thriller where people would think twice before they do anything because someone might be watching , but instead he went after cheap sex scenes and a predictable plot. it is worth watching after all just to see how Stone was coping with massive success of Basic instinct which led her to make the wrong choice because she was under pressure to stay the Hollywood sex symbol .

    I waited 18 years to see this movie because I had always heard how terrible it is. When it first came out, I seem to recall thinking it highly implausible that someone could have the kind of video and audio equipment you see in this movie. But the equipment and its use in the film is entirely plausible, even in 1993. I found no problems with the plot. It's an interesting thriller with something that's hard to find--a unique story that hasn't been told a thousand times already. The acting is good. The characters and their actions are completely believable. I was never left thinking that a real person might not have done the things that the people in the movie did. Having seen the movie, I really don't understand why so many people criticize it so harshly. In terms of telling a compelling, entertaining story, I would say it is far better than movies like Hereafter and on par with a movie like the Adjustment Bureau (just two recent movies I could think to compare it to). If you haven't seen it, give it a chance.

    Looks like a cross between a subject novelist Levin had always broached in "Rosemary's baby" (the building where horrible things happen;beware of neighbors!) and "rear window" (voyeurism:the telescope James Stewart used in Hitchcock's classic ;the 'improvement" in Baldwin's apartment) The parts of the two male principals have been changed in comparison with Levin's novel and Tom Berenger is not given a single chance to shine ;the new screenplay does not make much sense ,considering the wealthy spoilt child's behavior and obsession with his fellow men's life ;more than the hot scenes,the best is this real "sitcom" the boy is watching all day long ;considering today's TV ,the movie was ahead of its time for that matter. Levin's novel was not in the same league as "Rosemary's baby" ,"a kiss before dying" or even "the Stepford wives" ;but it was more interesting than later horrors such as "son of Rosemary" and the director did not make the best of it. =

    Sliver starts out fine, but it ages like milk, and by the end, it kind of stinks Dumb would be the easiest way to label Sliver, but to be more specific, I would call it immature. This is the kind of material where high profile people have low profile brains, resulting in a motion picture which intends to be dramatic by relying almost entirely on characters doing and saying vulgar, improper things: icky flirting, gratuitous sex and biggest of all, invading the privacy of others. Voyeurism is the main topic here. Having its roots Hitchcock, Sliver tries to take the peeping tom effect to the highest high it seems. Director Phillip Noyce sells it to us well visually, but he is unable to use it effectively as a plot device or for suspense. The cast are unable to perform with solidity, the story is unable to achieve focus, and the end product is not recommendable, even for those who get off on erotic thrillers. Try looking somewhere else.

    For long time, Basic Instinct and Sliver were two movies that I avoided watching. The general talk around me about these two movies was that both starred Sharon Stone and the primary theme of the movie was sex. But somewhere as time passed, I ended up giving the movie "Basic Instinct" a try and realized that in spite of being loaded with steamy sex scenes, the movie still had a story and some substance. There was indeed a lot of confusion throughout the movie which makes you wonder what happens next and maybe lay down a bet to predict the end of the movie. What I am trying to say is that, the movie is enjoyable, not for the sex but more so for the story and the element of thrill. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about this movie "Sliver", which I ended up watching in the hope that maybe people were wrong (as in case of Basic Instinct) that this movie was just sex. And yes, because the story is hardly gripping, the movie does end up being a movie which is all about sex. I was severely disappointed with this movie. The story line did not impress me much and Sharon Stone's character was annoying to say the least. Hardly anything in her character that you can like or sympathize. Nothing! Very shallow! The movie centers around an apartment owned by a pervert with money enough to wire the whole apartment with cameras so that he can watch everyone doing anything and I mean it - anything. The story (if there is something called a story) is lame. It follows how Sharon's character eventually finds this out and how she deals with this discovery and blah blah blah! A very predictable end once you are through to the last forty minutes of the movie. Of course, that does not mean, the earlier part is interesting. It is just a pervert's dream come true and nothing else. All and all, I can say that this is one of the movies you can safely avoid. Even a bad movie, I say to people, go and watch so that you know it is bad. But here is a movie, I can say, there is no need to even watch. You will not be missing anything. And if you are Sharon Stone's fans, well, I don't know what to say. I guess there is nothing much I can say. Overall, disappointing.

    Granted, the idea of the voyeur that sleeps in all of could provide interesting film material. Providing a potent cast including a leading role for foxy Sharon Stone who doesn't scant with female charms should only make this material more worthwhile. Even so, "Sliver" of 1993 is a barely mediocre film that does not nearly reach the high standards of mystery and suspense it seems to think. Comparisons with "Basic Instinct" (1992) are obvious, as both films are early 90s erotic thrillers from the sleazy mind of Joe Esterhas, and both films star sexy Sharon Stone on the peak of her career. Yet, "Sliver" is far less interesting a film. Not because the script is weaker, but mainly because this is a lot tamer than the scandalous "Basic Instinct", and because there are several periods of mere boredom in-between. This may be due to the fact that Philip Noyce, who is responsible for unmemorable films like "The Saint" and "Patriot Games", is certainly no director comparable to Paul Verhoeven, one of the few directors who successfully mix Exploitation cinema with Blockbuster budgets, most successfully with "Basic Instinct" and films like "Robo Cop", "Total Recall", "Flesh+Blood" or "Showgirls". The character Stone plays here is the total opposite to the Femme Fatale she played in "Basic Insinct". Stone plays Carly Norris, a beautiful and successful writer of biographies, who has become vulnerable and insecure ever since splitting from her boyfriend. She moves into the posh Manhattan apartment complex Sliver heights. The former tenant, a woman who had an amazing resemblance to Carly is supposed to have killed herself - only that in reality, it was someone else who threw her off her 13th floor balcony. And someone is watching the house's tenants via hidden cameras... In case you haven't seen the film, don't read on. ***WARNING! BIG SPOILERS AHEAD!*** What I disliked most about "Sliver" is the fact that it tries to be unpredictable, but is predictable all the way. From the beginning, we can see that somebody is watching the tenants 24/7, and it is clear that a murderer is on the loose. Several characters are introduced, and it is quite clear who is responsible for what. When moving into the apartment complex, sexy Sharon meets the handsome and friendly Zeke (William Baldwin) and it's immediately clear that there's a sexual tension between the two. Carly falls for Zeke, and at the latest when Zeke confesses to Carly that he is the owner of the house, it is clear who has been watching her take a shower on a silver screen. Then there's a sleazy and self-centered writer played by Tom Berenger. The guy basically has 'MANIAC' written all over him, and... Surprise!... Now I Would not call "Sliver" a complete failure. The film has some interesting points and the assumption that the voyeur is in all of us is quite well-illustrated. Sharon stone is stunningly beautiful in this film, and she also delivers a great performance. Seeing sexy Sharon bare it is sufficient reason to watch the film, and yet, she did so far more explicitly in "Basic Instinct" a year earlier. The supporting cast includes the great Martin Landau, and sexy young Polly Walker, who is most famous for her recent role of the ueber-intriguer Attia of the Julii on HBO's brilliant mini-series "Rome". Tom Berenger is typecast as a sleazy scumbag, and William Baldwin is convincing as the rich playboy with the sleazy hobby. - And yet, it is not really convincing at all. The film is full of inconsistencies. At one point, Zeke threatens a guy on the phone for molesting his stepdaughter. Would a man who spends his time secretly watching the tenants of an apartment complex in intimate situations really care? And even if he did, would he take any risks to be discovered? I don't think so, and this is only one of many illogical things about the film. What I, as a Horror fan, found interesting was the fact that the murders are very much in the style of Italian 70s Gialli. Director Noyce obviously let Horror's most intriguing sub-genre, the wonderful Giallo, serve as an inspiration here. Overall, "Sliver" is mildly entertaining for its exploration of voyeurism, and for satisfying the viewer's voyeurism by providing female eye-candy in form of sexy leading lady Sharon Stone. As a mystery, however, it fails. If you do, watch it for Sharon's boobies.

    This sexy thriller wasn't as interesting or well made as Basic instinct and is also some what silly that it has some funny moments though that being said I didn't find it terrible and Sharon Stone looks damn sexy in this at 35 years as a vulnerable woman moving to an apartment where a lady who looked like her was recently pushed from the window. We the audience are given 2 suspects who we believe may have been responsible for the fall Tom Berenger a kinda intense writer and William Baldwin a perverted horny landlord of the apartment who watches his tenants on television films. The film does manage some suspense and I thought the sex scenes were pretty good and probably not as explicit as some would expect so its not bad to watch at night time for a thriller film with erotics.

    If the sight of Sharon Stone and William Baldwin gyrating their way through a series of long and drawn-out sex scenes is appealing, then I'd recommend SLIVER, one in a wave of erotic thrillers that populated the mid-1990s in the wake of BASIC INSTINCT. For movie fans in general, though, SLIVER is a bit of a non-starter. The film's biggest flaw is an overly familiar script, which has an interesting premise involving voyeurism but does little with it (other than inviting the viewer to participate, a theme which has been done to death these days anyway). Sharon Stone moves into a high-tech apartment block where people are being murdered, and we're supposed to care about what happens next. There are flashes of interest and inspiration throughout, usually involving the supporting cast. Watching Tom Berenger chewing dialogue is always a delight, and ROME's Polly Walker shows up too, although sadly not for very long. The talents of CCH Pounder and Martin Landau also end up wasted in favour of dull, slightly wooden turns from Stone (who displays none of the charm and allure she essayed in BASIC INSTINCT) and a sweaty, unpleasant Baldwin. The thriller aspects are unevenly handled, and Aussie director Philip Noyce (who directed DEAD CALM, one of my favourite thrillers) drops the ball more than once, failing to elicit suspense from scenarios which should be tense and atmospheric. SLIVER isn't all bad; the most undemanding of movie fans might even enjoy it, but I'm afraid I've been here way too many times to see anything even remotely interesting.

The film is full of inconsistencies. At one point, Zeke threatens a guy on the phone for molesting his stepdaughter. Would a man who spends his time secretly watching the tenants of an apartment complex in intimate situations really care? And even if he did, would he take any risks to be discovered? I don't think so, and this is only one of many illogical things about the film. What I, as a Horror fan, found interesting was the fact that the murders are very much in the style of Italian 70s Gialli. Director Noyce obviously let Horror's most intriguing sub-genre, the wonderful Giallo, serve as an inspiration here. Overall, "Sliver" is mildly entertaining for its exploration of voyeurism, and for satisfying the viewer's voyeurism by providing female eye-candy in form of sexy leading lady Sharon Stone. As a mystery, however, it fails. If you do, watch it for Sharon's boobies.
