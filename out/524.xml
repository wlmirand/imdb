 <sinopse>
  Dictator Adenoid Hynkel has a doppelganger, a poor but kind Jewish barber living in the slums, who one day is mistaken for Hynkel.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Twenty years after the end of WWI in which the nation of Tomainia was on the losing side, Adenoid Hynkel has risen to power as the ruthless dictator of the country. He believes in a pure Aryan state, and the decimation of the Jews. This situation is unknown to a simple Jewish-Tomainian barber who has since been hospitalized the result of a WWI battle. Upon his release, the barber, who had been suffering from memory loss about the war, is shown the new persecuted life of the Jews by many living in the Jewish ghetto, including a washerwoman named Hannah, with whom he begins a relationship. The barber is ultimately spared such persecution by Commander Schultz, who he saved in that WWI battle. The lives of all Jews in Tomainia are eventually spared with a policy shift by Hynkel himself, who is doing so for ulterior motives. But those motives include a want for world domination, starting with the invasion of neighboring Osterlich, which may be threatened by Benzino Napaloni, the dictator ...

    Released on the big screen on October 15, 1940, the film is a satire of Charlie Chaplin at Hitler, in which a Jew is chosen to be the double of the dictator Adenoid Hynkel, who chairs the state Toman. A poor Jewish barber is arrested by the Nazis and taken to the camp with his friend, a former Tomanian soldier arrested for being too friendly with the Jews. More in jest, half seriously, someone once tried to prove that Chaplin made ​​The Great Dictator because Hitler copied his famous mustache. Leaving aside witticism, Chaplin remains among the first timely angry filmmakers, up to an unprecedented pamphleteer explosion in the American film, of all that means fascist constraint in individual lives and the community.

    One of the most controversial films of its time, The Great Dictator is Charlie Chaplin's satirical take on Adolf Hitler and his ideals. This is Charlie Chaplin's first talkie and doesn't portray Chaplin making a joke out of everything since the moments of laughter in this film are nicely blended with stark drama and makes a bold statement in the final moments that resonates all race, borders & boundaries and with its universal message connects with everyone. Highly entertaining, brilliantly structured & superbly performed, immensely enjoyable and presenting Chaplin in the role of both a Jew and a dictator, thus giving him more dimensions to explore, The Great Dictator is one of the many comedy classics that has only grown in stature with passing time. The last 5 minutes of this film alone creates far more impact than many other films trying to deliver the same message with their 2-hour plus runtime and Chaplin truly nailed that scene with his now prominent speech that wraps this film up. Overall, a daring, important & remarkable work from, arguably, the greatest cinematic personality to have ever lived.

    "Chaplin's masterpiece?" Henry asked. "Uh. Modern Times is a good movie too. There are also others. Like The tramp and I belief...eh" "City Lights?" "That one." "The Kid?" "Oh.. I guess." "Figured an commie like you would name Modern Times." Henry smiled. "Eh?" "You mentioned Modern Times. A commie would like it. The movie is just an attack on capitalism." "Uhm. Commie? Well.. let's talk about that in due time." "On with Hitler.. eh The Great Dictator." Henry said. "I bet he couldn't laugh about it, but I wonder.. would Mussolini have laughed about it?" "I bet not. I bet that people who are dictators can't laugh about themselves, if they could they wouldn't be dictators." Henry said. "Wow.. that is an observation of life." " I can observe life as well as anyone else can." "I bet." "So a masterpiece?" "Yes and no." "Yes and no?" "Well it's a masterpiece in the way it is made and what it is about and the statement Chaplin makes. That makes it an unique movie." "But it is also a long slapstick movie, which has it's moments at times, like when Hinkel and Napaloni meet, but still feels like a bit old fashioned even in the 1940. Like those chase scenes when the Schulz troopers are after him." "Schulz." Kristl laughed. "What?" "It is a funny name as it means guilt in German. It is an apt name because Schulz saves the Jewish barber because he owes him for saving his life, but later on he feel guilt because he has supported Hynkel. I wonder if Chaplin was deliberate in that." "Might be." Henry said, "I found most of the story somewhat dull and sometimes strange. Like when nobody sees the similarity between Hynkel and the Jewish barber. Also it has a nice feel about it. Like those Nazi were not nice people, but the it is probably meant as a slapstick. So it had to be nice." Kristl nodded, "The story has it's odd twist and turns. Like that Hynkel and the Jewish barber switch roles. It is as if he mixed two kind of movies. A serious movie and a slapstick movie." "It might be.. I found it a bit long in the tooth." Henry yawned. "Still it remains a masterpiece." "Ah" "It is a tribute to the belief that we are all humans, each and everyone of us, and that we could live in peace. The end speech is often felt as an awkward long statement.. but it is here that you feel Chaplin shoving aside the movie and directly addresses the viewer. It was of course not done and it must have felt embarrassing by many to be directly talked to. As a method of movie making it was seldom seen in a normal movie. It clearly brought out the idea that you can invoke a strong emotion by directly talking into the camera and the audience." "And that makes it a masterpiece?" "That and his direct appeal to humanity."

Of course Charlie Chaplin would have never made the movie, if he knew how things were going to turn out. The movie has some of the funniest scenes i have ever seen but it also finds itself in Drama, specially the last speech. This last speech, which many believe to be the weakness of the movie, is the most important of them all. He was asked by executives to cut the part out but he was determined to keep it since he knew the seriousness of the matter. Chaplin said he would have given anything to know how Hitler felt about it. I too would have given anything to know too but i also read, from IMDb FAQ, that Hitler saw it twice. It must have interested him in some level.......

    The Great Dictator is a funny, charming and witty film, with excellent performances, especially from Charlie Chaplin and his wife, Paulette Goddard. But it's not all about comedy; behind the laughters lies a critique of the war and how pointless, damaging and inhuman it is. It shows the situation of the Jewish people, who were often abused and ridiculized by the German army. It satirizes the greed and lust for power of Mussolini and Hitler, who most of the time act like children and not like grown-up adults, fighting with each other for the biggest piece of cake. The ending of the film is, without a doubt, one of the most beautiful I have ever seen. I guess that, at this point, most people know a word or two of the famous speech. It was so heart-felt, human and splendid I couldn't help but cry. The Great Dictator is a film that is not to be missed.

    Chaplin's 'The Great Dictator' is a masterpiece whose only fault is that even Chaplin could not imagine the horrors Adolf Hitler was capable of. It is a very funny film about the darkest horrors of modern history. Chaplin was a comedic genius and 'The Great Dictator' is in my humble opinion, his finest hour. There is no greater creative feat than to take the powerful oppressor and strip him of all his power through art. Chaplin's take on Hitler strips him of all his power. The greater clown was and always will be Adolf Hitler for his reprehensible evil views which Chaplin shows through his humor were incredibly stupid as well. 'The Great Dictator' is very much a film of it's time. Chaplin apparently said that he would not have made it had he known the extent of the atrocities committed by the Nazi. Indeed some of the film has a certain creepiness because we know what we know. I still sort of grimace a bit with the subplot involving the banker Epstein and Hynkel's temporary flirtation with the Jews. The timeless aspect of it though is how it skews the theatricality of such tyrants. Hitler was all show and no substance. What Chaplin does is brutally and often hilariously parody the theatrics behind the Nazi regime. Hitler's greatest power is in how he was able to generate emotion through his grandiose speeches. I've seen the Riefenstahl pictures and to be honest they scare me more than any horror film. Chaplin being the genius he was sees humor in them. It's obvious that Chaplin spent a great deal of time studying his subject as Hitler's mannerisms are copied to the tee and he outdoes himself in parodying them. The impersonation shows how silly the real thing was. I don't think it was ever Chaplin's intention to undermine the dangers of fascism. Adenoid Hynkel is a humorous and inept boob but he is a very real danger and Chaplin generates disgust from his audience as well as laughs. It is a credit to his tremendous skills as an actor and storyteller that he can balance these aspects of the character so well. There's a fiery and aggressive violent streak in Hynkel and he is capable of terrible things and yet we see him for what he really is, a bully who hides his awkwardness and insecurities with his violent fascist views. The Little Tramp is as charming and lovable as ever. I know there is debate as to whether or not the Jewish Barber is the final incantation of Chaplin's tramp and as a Chaplin fan I believe that he absolutely is and that 'The Great Dictator' is Chaplin's 'killing off' the character. The Tramp was always a reflection of the times he lived in and Chaplin did not alter the times to fit comedy. He put his Tramp in situations that showed how ugly the world could be. The Tramp is always a victim of the worst society has to offer it's poor and huddled masses. In 'The Great Dictator' the Tramp has encountered the pinnacle of ugliness man kind is capable of. Chaplin is still as funny as ever but it is shocking to see the Tramp do his slapstick in the streets where 'JEW' is painted on windows or when he plays hot potato with weapons designed to decimate and maim. This could have been a very depressing movie and yet it is heart warming and hopeful because the Tramp always represents faith in the goodness of mankind. Chaplin's speech at the end is a condemnation of fascism to be sure but it is also a eulogy to the tramp and what he stood for. Chaplin absolutely earned the right to such a speech despite it's theatricality because it perfectly sums up the Tramp's entire story. You must have faith in a better tomorrow and most importantly in your self. I think through comedy we have gotten the truest depiction of what Hitler really was. Too many times artists want to portray him as evil incarnate. If Hitler was evil incarnate than the inexcusable Holocaust has an excuse. 'The Great Dictator' and Chaplin's performance bring him out into the open. Hitler was a damn fool

    In Tomania(Germany), dictator Hynkel(Chaplin, doing a fantastic job aping and subverting Hitler's(both he and Mussolini are reduced to spoilt children, screaming when they don't get their way, with their world-altering war decisions being nothing more than them stroking their own egos... an all too true breakdown of many major despots) mannerisms, shouting nonsense speeches and short temper) has a doppelganger in a poor, kind Jewish barber(the contrast he creates between these is compelling) - and the fact that the two look the same, yet are treated so differently is one of numerous clever, and often subtle, comments on the ideology. The writing reveals a thorough understanding of the thinking, reasoning and actions of the Nazis. Sure, there are details that are changed or the like, forgivably to ease the story-telling, to make a point, etc. There are also other types of comedy; mocking and black humor is used to remove the sting from the fear of the shells, army and the mistreatment of the children of Israel. And that last one is treated seriously, as well. The tone will switch very effectively, and suddenly we are afraid of something similar to what we've just been chuckling at. This way, the reality doesn't become lost, and one can sense the actual threat of persecution and foreign invasion right underneath it all. The smart references, including some that, at the time, not everyone would have known enough to get, are mixed in with simpler material. While the slapstick can be rather inspired, the wordplays are on the nose(Italy becomes Bacteria... those don't even sound alike...), and there is the occasional half-baked gag, abandoned as quickly and abruptly as it is begun. This is swiftly paced, and the 120 minute running time tends to go by smoothly(if the narrative jumps awkwardly once or twice). Acting is strong for all concerned, both the broad gesturing and the finer nuances(Goddard is charming, inspiring and memorable as the outspoken Hannah). There is a little violent and disturbing content in this. I recommend this to everyone who appreciates satire dealing with tragedy. 9/10

    Charlie Chaplin's boldest film for its willingness to take on Adolf Hitler before nearly anyone else, "The Great Dictator" was also Chaplin taking on sound 11 years after everyone else. If it had to be the end of cinema's greatest Silent Clown, he did what he could to take down history's greatest monster in the process. There are two reasons to like "The Great Dictator." One is that Chaplin was on the side of the angels, at no small risk given his target's ambitions. The other is he didn't forget to make it funny. Essentially a Prince And The Pauper remake, "Dictator" presents Chaplin as both Adenoid Hynkel, the cruel if inept "Phooey" (a. k. a. "F&uuml;hrer") of Tomainia, and a Jewish World War I veteran, poignantly left unnamed as a nod to the Common Man, who only wants to work in peace at his barber shop. While Hynkel struggles with his two great passions, hating Jews and loving war, the barber finds love and a cause to believe in. The comedy here can be categorized into the great and the good, with most of the former featuring Chaplin as Hynkel. He's simply much funnier here as the bad guy, whether playing it broad (jumping secretaries, delivering speeches in hate-choked gobbledegook) or subtle (after shooting dead a man who claims to have "perfected" a bullet-proof suit, Hynkel simply turns and walks away with a three-word critique: "Far from perfect.") Hynkel is a character who solves Chaplin's legendary problem with sound, whether dressing down his blubbering subordinate Herring (Billy Gilbert) or struggling to keep his composure when fellow dictator Napaloni (Jack Oakie) rebuffs his attempts at intimidation. Told by his right-hand man Garbitsch (Henry Daniell) that the people are objecting to sawdust in the bread, he huffs: "What more do they want? It's from the finest lumber our mills can supply!" The comedy around the barber gets more labored. Maybe it's because much of it turns on the oppression of the Jews, though Chaplin here is trying to establish them as underdogs and rooting interest. It's here the film becomes tricky, not because he is mocking the unmockable but because the characters we meet, including the Barber, are fairly bland and the humor patchy. There is some very funny material here, but excessive bits too where people get klonked with pans or splattered with whitewash. At least Chaplin avoided setting a pie fight in a starving ghetto. The famous last scene is a great divider for many; in it Chaplin steps out of character to address us the audience about...what? The world needs more love and less hate, I guess. It's a philosophically strangled message, both anti-fascist and oddly pacifistic at a time when Hitler's legions were swallowing Europe, with Chaplin warning of "machine men with machine minds" as if he was still making "Modern Times" and punching the sky at times for lame effect. To me it's a crass way to end a good comedy, if perhaps necessary given the stakes involved. Hitler was real, and calling him out for what he was had real value in terms of rallying those called upon to defeat him. If it doesn't transcend time as well as it could, "The Great Dictator" is still a fine comedy that delivers strong laughs and stronger historical resonances.

    Easy to sneer now - but think 1940. Chaplin's three-minute sermon at the end of this film can sound like every brotherly-love clich&eacute; rolled into one, as well as being technically dubious - bolted-on, rather than crafted into the action, and implausible anyway, coming from the lips of a humble barber. But unlike any other, 1940 was a year full of despair for the world, and an appeal for optimism from the Little Tramp, never downhearted for long, must have provided a ray of hope for millions, when it was most needed. "The hate of men will pass." Dare to believe it... Mistaken identity is not exactly the most original storyline either, but Chaplin makes good use of it in his dual role as Hynkel (Hitler) and an unnamed Jewish barber in the ghetto. The action starts in 1918, with the collapse of the Tomanian (German) army, and the barber saving the life of a wounded pilot, but losing his own memory through concussion. Fast-forward twenty years, and the barber escapes from his care-home, to return to the ghetto, now governed by stormtroopers reporting to... none other than the ex-pilot, who is secretly planning a resistance movement. The political background is the Anschluss (invasion of Austria) where Hynkel is competing for influence with an obvious Mussolini figure, played with gusto by Jack Oakie. Owing to some fairly contrived twists, the barber and the pilot find themselves pursued by the law, and happen to arrive at the Austrian border in uniform, just as Hynkel, out duck-shooting in civilian clothes, gets arrested in error. So a huge parade, waiting to be addressed by Hynkel, gets the barber's speech instead, and they all cheer the message of peace. This was only Chaplin's first talkie, and some of its best scenes owe much to silent technique, such as his dance with an inflatable globe, and other sequences that are almost mime with music. Work had started on this film in 1937, and Britain and America were both planning to boycott it, for the sake of their neutrality. It is to Chaplin's credit that he risked his career, as well as his own capital, in pressing ahead with such a vast commitment. But his political naivety always showed, as when someone suggested he should make a similar film about Stalin. "It is hard to play a man who has no faults", came the astonishing reply. Finally, no report on The Great Dictator is complete without some verdict about Hitler's own rumoured screening of it. Two prints were acquired from Portugal and delivered to the F&uuml;hrer's private cinema. Albert Speer declared that Hitler never saw the film - but he couldn't strictly have known. Some say he watched it twice in total silence and made no reaction. Chaplin said he would give anything to know what he thought of it.

    Unforgettable political satire that was tumultuously topical and cannot be realized today with any real assimilation of place and time. It was a brave and biting commentary on the Headlines of the day and prophetically postured what was to be uncovered. A marvelous and unsettling, in retrospect, account of the marching goose-steps of Gestapo tactics and unnatural Nationalism and Fascism. In 1940 this was funny, as it is today, but in just a short time after its release its subject matter could only elicit nervous, under the breath, reluctant half-smiles. It is a graceful and searing poke in the eye at a megalomaniacal Leader of a Sheeple population that was mesmerized by psychological tricks and economic persuasion. A suffering Nation transformed into a War Machine through pomp and circumstance. The Film and its Director held little back as it made an attempt at shedding some light on the absurdities yet to be unveiled. This is a Masterpiece, high Art in its relevance and in hindsight a predetermined cry-out for sanity in what was becoming a completely unhinged and insane World. There are many laughs here as well as intellectual insights and it is all so well produced and perceived that it remains today a testament to Humanity's struggle to stay relatively Human in inhuman situations. There is hardly a false note here and this can be regarded as one of the most poignant views and commentaries on the forces of Evil ever seen through the lens of Motion Picture prognostications and empathetic concerns. One of the best from one of the best...Charlie Chaplin.

    The Great Dictator is a funny, charming and witty film, with excellent performances, especially from Charlie Chaplin and his wife, Paulette Goddard. But it's not all about comedy; behind the laughters lies a critique of the war and how pointless, damaging and inhuman it is. It shows the situation of the Jewish people, who were often abused and ridiculized by the German army. It satirizes the greed and lust for power of Mussolini and Hitler, who most of the time act like children and not like grown-up adults, fighting with each other for the biggest piece of cake. The ending of the film is, without a doubt, one of the most beautiful I have ever seen. I guess that, at this point, most people know a word or two of the famous speech. It was so heart-felt, human and splendid I couldn't help but cry. The Great Dictator is a film that is not to be missed.

    Chaplin's 'The Great Dictator' is a masterpiece whose only fault is that even Chaplin could not imagine the horrors Adolf Hitler was capable of. It is a very funny film about the darkest horrors of modern history. Chaplin was a comedic genius and 'The Great Dictator' is in my humble opinion, his finest hour. There is no greater creative feat than to take the powerful oppressor and strip him of all his power through art. Chaplin's take on Hitler strips him of all his power. The greater clown was and always will be Adolf Hitler for his reprehensible evil views which Chaplin shows through his humor were incredibly stupid as well. 'The Great Dictator' is very much a film of it's time. Chaplin apparently said that he would not have made it had he known the extent of the atrocities committed by the Nazi. Indeed some of the film has a certain creepiness because we know what we know. I still sort of grimace a bit with the subplot involving the banker Epstein and Hynkel's temporary flirtation with the Jews. The timeless aspect of it though is how it skews the theatricality of such tyrants. Hitler was all show and no substance. What Chaplin does is brutally and often hilariously parody the theatrics behind the Nazi regime. Hitler's greatest power is in how he was able to generate emotion through his grandiose speeches. I've seen the Riefenstahl pictures and to be honest they scare me more than any horror film. Chaplin being the genius he was sees humor in them. It's obvious that Chaplin spent a great deal of time studying his subject as Hitler's mannerisms are copied to the tee and he outdoes himself in parodying them. The impersonation shows how silly the real thing was. I don't think it was ever Chaplin's intention to undermine the dangers of fascism. Adenoid Hynkel is a humorous and inept boob but he is a very real danger and Chaplin generates disgust from his audience as well as laughs. It is a credit to his tremendous skills as an actor and storyteller that he can balance these aspects of the character so well. There's a fiery and aggressive violent streak in Hynkel and he is capable of terrible things and yet we see him for what he really is, a bully who hides his awkwardness and insecurities with his violent fascist views. The Little Tramp is as charming and lovable as ever. I know there is debate as to whether or not the Jewish Barber is the final incantation of Chaplin's tramp and as a Chaplin fan I believe that he absolutely is and that 'The Great Dictator' is Chaplin's 'killing off' the character. The Tramp was always a reflection of the times he lived in and Chaplin did not alter the times to fit comedy. He put his Tramp in situations that showed how ugly the world could be. The Tramp is always a victim of the worst society has to offer it's poor and huddled masses. In 'The Great Dictator' the Tramp has encountered the pinnacle of ugliness man kind is capable of. Chaplin is still as funny as ever but it is shocking to see the Tramp do his slapstick in the streets where 'JEW' is painted on windows or when he plays hot potato with weapons designed to decimate and maim. This could have been a very depressing movie and yet it is heart warming and hopeful because the Tramp always represents faith in the goodness of mankind. Chaplin's speech at the end is a condemnation of fascism to be sure but it is also a eulogy to the tramp and what he stood for. Chaplin absolutely earned the right to such a speech despite it's theatricality because it perfectly sums up the Tramp's entire story. You must have faith in a better tomorrow and most importantly in your self. I think through comedy we have gotten the truest depiction of what Hitler really was. Too many times artists want to portray him as evil incarnate. If Hitler was evil incarnate than the inexcusable Holocaust has an excuse. 'The Great Dictator' and Chaplin's performance bring him out into the open. Hitler was a damn fool

    In Tomania(Germany), dictator Hynkel(Chaplin, doing a fantastic job aping and subverting Hitler's(both he and Mussolini are reduced to spoilt children, screaming when they don't get their way, with their world-altering war decisions being nothing more than them stroking their own egos... an all too true breakdown of many major despots) mannerisms, shouting nonsense speeches and short temper) has a doppelganger in a poor, kind Jewish barber(the contrast he creates between these is compelling) - and the fact that the two look the same, yet are treated so differently is one of numerous clever, and often subtle, comments on the ideology. The writing reveals a thorough understanding of the thinking, reasoning and actions of the Nazis. Sure, there are details that are changed or the like, forgivably to ease the story-telling, to make a point, etc. There are also other types of comedy; mocking and black humor is used to remove the sting from the fear of the shells, army and the mistreatment of the children of Israel. And that last one is treated seriously, as well. The tone will switch very effectively, and suddenly we are afraid of something similar to what we've just been chuckling at. This way, the reality doesn't become lost, and one can sense the actual threat of persecution and foreign invasion right underneath it all. The smart references, including some that, at the time, not everyone would have known enough to get, are mixed in with simpler material. While the slapstick can be rather inspired, the wordplays are on the nose(Italy becomes Bacteria... those don't even sound alike...), and there is the occasional half-baked gag, abandoned as quickly and abruptly as it is begun. This is swiftly paced, and the 120 minute running time tends to go by smoothly(if the narrative jumps awkwardly once or twice). Acting is strong for all concerned, both the broad gesturing and the finer nuances(Goddard is charming, inspiring and memorable as the outspoken Hannah). There is a little violent and disturbing content in this. I recommend this to everyone who appreciates satire dealing with tragedy. 9/10

    Charlie Chaplin's boldest film for its willingness to take on Adolf Hitler before nearly anyone else, "The Great Dictator" was also Chaplin taking on sound 11 years after everyone else. If it had to be the end of cinema's greatest Silent Clown, he did what he could to take down history's greatest monster in the process. There are two reasons to like "The Great Dictator." One is that Chaplin was on the side of the angels, at no small risk given his target's ambitions. The other is he didn't forget to make it funny. Essentially a Prince And The Pauper remake, "Dictator" presents Chaplin as both Adenoid Hynkel, the cruel if inept "Phooey" (a. k. a. "F&uuml;hrer") of Tomainia, and a Jewish World War I veteran, poignantly left unnamed as a nod to the Common Man, who only wants to work in peace at his barber shop. While Hynkel struggles with his two great passions, hating Jews and loving war, the barber finds love and a cause to believe in. The comedy here can be categorized into the great and the good, with most of the former featuring Chaplin as Hynkel. He's simply much funnier here as the bad guy, whether playing it broad (jumping secretaries, delivering speeches in hate-choked gobbledegook) or subtle (after shooting dead a man who claims to have "perfected" a bullet-proof suit, Hynkel simply turns and walks away with a three-word critique: "Far from perfect.") Hynkel is a character who solves Chaplin's legendary problem with sound, whether dressing down his blubbering subordinate Herring (Billy Gilbert) or struggling to keep his composure when fellow dictator Napaloni (Jack Oakie) rebuffs his attempts at intimidation. Told by his right-hand man Garbitsch (Henry Daniell) that the people are objecting to sawdust in the bread, he huffs: "What more do they want? It's from the finest lumber our mills can supply!" The comedy around the barber gets more labored. Maybe it's because much of it turns on the oppression of the Jews, though Chaplin here is trying to establish them as underdogs and rooting interest. It's here the film becomes tricky, not because he is mocking the unmockable but because the characters we meet, including the Barber, are fairly bland and the humor patchy. There is some very funny material here, but excessive bits too where people get klonked with pans or splattered with whitewash. At least Chaplin avoided setting a pie fight in a starving ghetto. The famous last scene is a great divider for many; in it Chaplin steps out of character to address us the audience about...what? The world needs more love and less hate, I guess. It's a philosophically strangled message, both anti-fascist and oddly pacifistic at a time when Hitler's legions were swallowing Europe, with Chaplin warning of "machine men with machine minds" as if he was still making "Modern Times" and punching the sky at times for lame effect. To me it's a crass way to end a good comedy, if perhaps necessary given the stakes involved. Hitler was real, and calling him out for what he was had real value in terms of rallying those called upon to defeat him. If it doesn't transcend time as well as it could, "The Great Dictator" is still a fine comedy that delivers strong laughs and stronger historical resonances.

    Easy to sneer now - but think 1940. Chaplin's three-minute sermon at the end of this film can sound like every brotherly-love clich&eacute; rolled into one, as well as being technically dubious - bolted-on, rather than crafted into the action, and implausible anyway, coming from the lips of a humble barber. But unlike any other, 1940 was a year full of despair for the world, and an appeal for optimism from the Little Tramp, never downhearted for long, must have provided a ray of hope for millions, when it was most needed. "The hate of men will pass." Dare to believe it... Mistaken identity is not exactly the most original storyline either, but Chaplin makes good use of it in his dual role as Hynkel (Hitler) and an unnamed Jewish barber in the ghetto. The action starts in 1918, with the collapse of the Tomanian (German) army, and the barber saving the life of a wounded pilot, but losing his own memory through concussion. Fast-forward twenty years, and the barber escapes from his care-home, to return to the ghetto, now governed by stormtroopers reporting to... none other than the ex-pilot, who is secretly planning a resistance movement. The political background is the Anschluss (invasion of Austria) where Hynkel is competing for influence with an obvious Mussolini figure, played with gusto by Jack Oakie. Owing to some fairly contrived twists, the barber and the pilot find themselves pursued by the law, and happen to arrive at the Austrian border in uniform, just as Hynkel, out duck-shooting in civilian clothes, gets arrested in error. So a huge parade, waiting to be addressed by Hynkel, gets the barber's speech instead, and they all cheer the message of peace. This was only Chaplin's first talkie, and some of its best scenes owe much to silent technique, such as his dance with an inflatable globe, and other sequences that are almost mime with music. Work had started on this film in 1937, and Britain and America were both planning to boycott it, for the sake of their neutrality. It is to Chaplin's credit that he risked his career, as well as his own capital, in pressing ahead with such a vast commitment. But his political naivety always showed, as when someone suggested he should make a similar film about Stalin. "It is hard to play a man who has no faults", came the astonishing reply. Finally, no report on The Great Dictator is complete without some verdict about Hitler's own rumoured screening of it. Two prints were acquired from Portugal and delivered to the F&uuml;hrer's private cinema. Albert Speer declared that Hitler never saw the film - but he couldn't strictly have known. Some say he watched it twice in total silence and made no reaction. Chaplin said he would give anything to know what he thought of it.

    Unforgettable political satire that was tumultuously topical and cannot be realized today with any real assimilation of place and time. It was a brave and biting commentary on the Headlines of the day and prophetically postured what was to be uncovered. A marvelous and unsettling, in retrospect, account of the marching goose-steps of Gestapo tactics and unnatural Nationalism and Fascism. In 1940 this was funny, as it is today, but in just a short time after its release its subject matter could only elicit nervous, under the breath, reluctant half-smiles. It is a graceful and searing poke in the eye at a megalomaniacal Leader of a Sheeple population that was mesmerized by psychological tricks and economic persuasion. A suffering Nation transformed into a War Machine through pomp and circumstance. The Film and its Director held little back as it made an attempt at shedding some light on the absurdities yet to be unveiled. This is a Masterpiece, high Art in its relevance and in hindsight a predetermined cry-out for sanity in what was becoming a completely unhinged and insane World. There are many laughs here as well as intellectual insights and it is all so well produced and perceived that it remains today a testament to Humanity's struggle to stay relatively Human in inhuman situations. There is hardly a false note here and this can be regarded as one of the most poignant views and commentaries on the forces of Evil ever seen through the lens of Motion Picture prognostications and empathetic concerns. One of the best from one of the best...Charlie Chaplin.

    Released on the big screen on October 15, 1940, the film is a satire of Charlie Chaplin at Hitler, in which a Jew is chosen to be the double of the dictator Adenoid Hynkel, who chairs the state Toman. A poor Jewish barber is arrested by the Nazis and taken to the camp with his friend, a former Tomanian soldier arrested for being too friendly with the Jews. More in jest, half seriously, someone once tried to prove that Chaplin made ​​The Great Dictator because Hitler copied his famous mustache. Leaving aside witticism, Chaplin remains among the first timely angry filmmakers, up to an unprecedented pamphleteer explosion in the American film, of all that means fascist constraint in individual lives and the community.

    One of the most controversial films of its time, The Great Dictator is Charlie Chaplin's satirical take on Adolf Hitler and his ideals. This is Charlie Chaplin's first talkie and doesn't portray Chaplin making a joke out of everything since the moments of laughter in this film are nicely blended with stark drama and makes a bold statement in the final moments that resonates all race, borders & boundaries and with its universal message connects with everyone. Highly entertaining, brilliantly structured & superbly performed, immensely enjoyable and presenting Chaplin in the role of both a Jew and a dictator, thus giving him more dimensions to explore, The Great Dictator is one of the many comedy classics that has only grown in stature with passing time. The last 5 minutes of this film alone creates far more impact than many other films trying to deliver the same message with their 2-hour plus runtime and Chaplin truly nailed that scene with his now prominent speech that wraps this film up. Overall, a daring, important & remarkable work from, arguably, the greatest cinematic personality to have ever lived.

    "Chaplin's masterpiece?" Henry asked. "Uh. Modern Times is a good movie too. There are also others. Like The tramp and I belief...eh" "City Lights?" "That one." "The Kid?" "Oh.. I guess." "Figured an commie like you would name Modern Times." Henry smiled. "Eh?" "You mentioned Modern Times. A commie would like it. The movie is just an attack on capitalism." "Uhm. Commie? Well.. let's talk about that in due time." "On with Hitler.. eh The Great Dictator." Henry said. "I bet he couldn't laugh about it, but I wonder.. would Mussolini have laughed about it?" "I bet not. I bet that people who are dictators can't laugh about themselves, if they could they wouldn't be dictators." Henry said. "Wow.. that is an observation of life." " I can observe life as well as anyone else can." "I bet." "So a masterpiece?" "Yes and no." "Yes and no?" "Well it's a masterpiece in the way it is made and what it is about and the statement Chaplin makes. That makes it an unique movie." "But it is also a long slapstick movie, which has it's moments at times, like when Hinkel and Napaloni meet, but still feels like a bit old fashioned even in the 1940. Like those chase scenes when the Schulz troopers are after him." "Schulz." Kristl laughed. "What?" "It is a funny name as it means guilt in German. It is an apt name because Schulz saves the Jewish barber because he owes him for saving his life, but later on he feel guilt because he has supported Hynkel. I wonder if Chaplin was deliberate in that." "Might be." Henry said, "I found most of the story somewhat dull and sometimes strange. Like when nobody sees the similarity between Hynkel and the Jewish barber. Also it has a nice feel about it. Like those Nazi were not nice people, but the it is probably meant as a slapstick. So it had to be nice." Kristl nodded, "The story has it's odd twist and turns. Like that Hynkel and the Jewish barber switch roles. It is as if he mixed two kind of movies. A serious movie and a slapstick movie." "It might be.. I found it a bit long in the tooth." Henry yawned. "Still it remains a masterpiece." "Ah" "It is a tribute to the belief that we are all humans, each and everyone of us, and that we could live in peace. The end speech is often felt as an awkward long statement.. but it is here that you feel Chaplin shoving aside the movie and directly addresses the viewer. It was of course not done and it must have felt embarrassing by many to be directly talked to. As a method of movie making it was seldom seen in a normal movie. It clearly brought out the idea that you can invoke a strong emotion by directly talking into the camera and the audience." "And that makes it a masterpiece?" "That and his direct appeal to humanity."

    The Great Dictator is a break nick comedy that satirizes Hitler like no other film maker in history has ever dared or will ever dare. Of course Charlie Chaplin would have never made the movie, if he knew how things were going to turn out. The movie has some of the funniest scenes i have ever seen but it also finds itself in Drama, specially the last speech. This last speech, which many believe to be the weakness of the movie, is the most important of them all. He was asked by executives to cut the part out but he was determined to keep it since he knew the seriousness of the matter. Chaplin said he would have given anything to know how Hitler felt about it. I too would have given anything to know too but i also read, from IMDb FAQ, that Hitler saw it twice. It must have interested him in some level.......

He's simply much funnier here as the bad guy, whether playing it broad (jumping secretaries, delivering speeches in hate-choked gobbledegook) or subtle (after shooting dead a man who claims to have "perfected" a bullet-proof suit, Hynkel simply turns and walks away with a three-word critique: "Far from perfect.") Hynkel is a character who solves Chaplin's legendary problem with sound, whether dressing down his blubbering subordinate Herring (Billy Gilbert) or struggling to keep his composure when fellow dictator Napaloni (Jack Oakie) rebuffs his attempts at intimidation.

The famous last scene is a great divider for many; in it Chaplin steps out of character to address us the audience about...what? The world needs more love and less hate, I guess. It's a philosophically strangled message, both anti-fascist and oddly pacifistic at a time when Hitler's legions were swallowing Europe, with Chaplin warning of "machine men with machine minds" as if he was still making "Modern Times" and punching the sky at times for lame effect. To me it's a crass way to end a good comedy, if perhaps necessary given the stakes involved. Hitler was real, and calling him out for what he was had real value in terms of rallying those called upon to defeat him. If it doesn't transcend time as well as it could, "The Great Dictator" is still a fine comedy that delivers strong laughs and stronger historical resonances.

    Easy to sneer now - but think 1940. Chaplin's three-minute sermon at the end of this film can sound like every brotherly-love clich&eacute; rolled into one, as well as being technically dubious - bolted-on, rather than crafted into the action, and implausible anyway, coming from the lips of a humble barber. But unlike any other, 1940 was a year full of despair for the world, and an appeal for optimism from the Little Tramp, never downhearted for long, must have provided a ray of hope for millions, when it was most needed. "The hate of men will pass." Dare to believe it... Mistaken identity is not exactly the most original storyline either, but Chaplin makes good use of it in his dual role as Hynkel (Hitler) and an unnamed Jewish barber in the ghetto. The action starts in 1918, with the collapse of the Tomanian (German) army, and the barber saving the life of a wounded pilot, but losing his own memory through concussion. Fast-forward twenty years, and the barber escapes from his care-home, to return to the ghetto, now governed by stormtroopers reporting to... none other than the ex-pilot, who is secretly planning a resistance movement. The political background is the Anschluss (invasion of Austria) where Hynkel is competing for influence with an obvious Mussolini figure, played with gusto by Jack Oakie. Owing to some fairly contrived twists, the barber and the pilot find themselves pursued by the law, and happen to arrive at the Austrian border in uniform, just as Hynkel, out duck-shooting in civilian clothes, gets arrested in error. So a huge parade, waiting to be addressed by Hynkel, gets the barber's speech instead, and they all cheer the message of peace. This was only Chaplin's first talkie, and some of its best scenes owe much to silent technique, such as his dance with an inflatable globe, and other sequences that are almost mime with music. Work had started on this film in 1937, and Britain and America were both planning to boycott it, for the sake of their neutrality. It is to Chaplin's credit that he risked his career, as well as his own capital, in pressing ahead with such a vast commitment. But his political naivety always showed, as when someone suggested he should make a similar film about Stalin. "It is hard to play a man who has no faults", came the astonishing reply. Finally, no report on The Great Dictator is complete without some verdict about Hitler's own rumoured screening of it. Two prints were acquired from Portugal and delivered to the F&uuml;hrer's private cinema. Albert Speer declared that Hitler never saw the film - but he couldn't strictly have known. Some say he watched it twice in total silence and made no reaction. Chaplin said he would give anything to know what he thought of it.

    Unforgettable political satire that was tumultuously topical and cannot be realized today with any real assimilation of place and time. It was a brave and biting commentary on the Headlines of the day and prophetically postured what was to be uncovered. A marvelous and unsettling, in retrospect, account of the marching goose-steps of Gestapo tactics and unnatural Nationalism and Fascism. In 1940 this was funny, as it is today, but in just a short time after its release its subject matter could only elicit nervous, under the breath, reluctant half-smiles. It is a graceful and searing poke in the eye at a megalomaniacal Leader of a Sheeple population that was mesmerized by psychological tricks and economic persuasion. A suffering Nation transformed into a War Machine through pomp and circumstance. The Film and its Director held little back as it made an attempt at shedding some light on the absurdities yet to be unveiled. This is a Masterpiece, high Art in its relevance and in hindsight a predetermined cry-out for sanity in what was becoming a completely unhinged and insane World. There are many laughs here as well as intellectual insights and it is all so well produced and perceived that it remains today a testament to Humanity's struggle to stay relatively Human in inhuman situations. There is hardly a false note here and this can be regarded as one of the most poignant views and commentaries on the forces of Evil ever seen through the lens of Motion Picture prognostications and empathetic concerns. One of the best from one of the best...Charlie Chaplin.

    Released on the big screen on October 15, 1940, the film is a satire of Charlie Chaplin at Hitler, in which a Jew is chosen to be the double of the dictator Adenoid Hynkel, who chairs the state Toman. A poor Jewish barber is arrested by the Nazis and taken to the camp with his friend, a former Tomanian soldier arrested for being too friendly with the Jews. More in jest, half seriously, someone once tried to prove that Chaplin made ​​The Great Dictator because Hitler copied his famous mustache. Leaving aside witticism, Chaplin remains among the first timely angry filmmakers, up to an unprecedented pamphleteer explosion in the American film, of all that means fascist constraint in individual lives and the community.

    One of the most controversial films of its time, The Great Dictator is Charlie Chaplin's satirical take on Adolf Hitler and his ideals. This is Charlie Chaplin's first talkie and doesn't portray Chaplin making a joke out of everything since the moments of laughter in this film are nicely blended with stark drama and makes a bold statement in the final moments that resonates all race, borders & boundaries and with its universal message connects with everyone. Highly entertaining, brilliantly structured & superbly performed, immensely enjoyable and presenting Chaplin in the role of both a Jew and a dictator, thus giving him more dimensions to explore, The Great Dictator is one of the many comedy classics that has only grown in stature with passing time. The last 5 minutes of this film alone creates far more impact than many other films trying to deliver the same message with their 2-hour plus runtime and Chaplin truly nailed that scene with his now prominent speech that wraps this film up. Overall, a daring, important & remarkable work from, arguably, the greatest cinematic personality to have ever lived.

    "Chaplin's masterpiece?" Henry asked. "Uh. Modern Times is a good movie too. There are also others. Like The tramp and I belief...eh" "City Lights?" "That one." "The Kid?" "Oh.. I guess." "Figured an commie like you would name Modern Times." Henry smiled. "Eh?" "You mentioned Modern Times. A commie would like it. The movie is just an attack on capitalism." "Uhm. Commie? Well.. let's talk about that in due time." "On with Hitler.. eh The Great Dictator." Henry said. "I bet he couldn't laugh about it, but I wonder.. would Mussolini have laughed about it?" "I bet not. I bet that people who are dictators can't laugh about themselves, if they could they wouldn't be dictators." Henry said. "Wow.. that is an observation of life." " I can observe life as well as anyone else can." "I bet." "So a masterpiece?" "Yes and no." "Yes and no?" "Well it's a masterpiece in the way it is made and what it is about and the statement Chaplin makes. That makes it an unique movie." "But it is also a long slapstick movie, which has it's moments at times, like when Hinkel and Napaloni meet, but still feels like a bit old fashioned even in the 1940. Like those chase scenes when the Schulz troopers are after him." "Schulz." Kristl laughed. "What?" "It is a funny name as it means guilt in German. It is an apt name because Schulz saves the Jewish barber because he owes him for saving his life, but later on he feel guilt because he has supported Hynkel. I wonder if Chaplin was deliberate in that." "Might be." Henry said, "I found most of the story somewhat dull and sometimes strange. Like when nobody sees the similarity between Hynkel and the Jewish barber. Also it has a nice feel about it. Like those Nazi were not nice people, but the it is probably meant as a slapstick. So it had to be nice." Kristl nodded, "The story has it's odd twist and turns. Like that Hynkel and the Jewish barber switch roles. It is as if he mixed two kind of movies. A serious movie and a slapstick movie." "It might be.. I found it a bit long in the tooth." Henry yawned. "Still it remains a masterpiece." "Ah" "It is a tribute to the belief that we are all humans, each and everyone of us, and that we could live in peace. The end speech is often felt as an awkward long statement.. but it is here that you feel Chaplin shoving aside the movie and directly addresses the viewer. It was of course not done and it must have felt embarrassing by many to be directly talked to. As a method of movie making it was seldom seen in a normal movie. It clearly brought out the idea that you can invoke a strong emotion by directly talking into the camera and the audience." "And that makes it a masterpiece?" "That and his direct appeal to humanity."

    The Great Dictator is a break nick comedy that satirizes Hitler like no other film maker in history has ever dared or will ever dare. Of course Charlie Chaplin would have never made the movie, if he knew how things were going to turn out. The movie has some of the funniest scenes i have ever seen but it also finds itself in Drama, specially the last speech. This last speech, which many believe to be the weakness of the movie, is the most important of them all. He was asked by executives to cut the part out but he was determined to keep it since he knew the seriousness of the matter. Chaplin said he would have given anything to know how Hitler felt about it. I too would have given anything to know too but i also read, from IMDb FAQ, that Hitler saw it twice. It must have interested him in some level.......

    The Great Dictator is a funny, charming and witty film, with excellent performances, especially from Charlie Chaplin and his wife, Paulette Goddard. But it's not all about comedy; behind the laughters lies a critique of the war and how pointless, damaging and inhuman it is. It shows the situation of the Jewish people, who were often abused and ridiculized by the German army. It satirizes the greed and lust for power of Mussolini and Hitler, who most of the time act like children and not like grown-up adults, fighting with each other for the biggest piece of cake. The ending of the film is, without a doubt, one of the most beautiful I have ever seen. I guess that, at this point, most people know a word or two of the famous speech. It was so heart-felt, human and splendid I couldn't help but cry. The Great Dictator is a film that is not to be missed.

    Chaplin's 'The Great Dictator' is a masterpiece whose only fault is that even Chaplin could not imagine the horrors Adolf Hitler was capable of. It is a very funny film about the darkest horrors of modern history. Chaplin was a comedic genius and 'The Great Dictator' is in my humble opinion, his finest hour. There is no greater creative feat than to take the powerful oppressor and strip him of all his power through art. Chaplin's take on Hitler strips him of all his power. The greater clown was and always will be Adolf Hitler for his reprehensible evil views which Chaplin shows through his humor were incredibly stupid as well. 'The Great Dictator' is very much a film of it's time. Chaplin apparently said that he would not have made it had he known the extent of the atrocities committed by the Nazi. Indeed some of the film has a certain creepiness because we know what we know. I still sort of grimace a bit with the subplot involving the banker Epstein and Hynkel's temporary flirtation with the Jews. The timeless aspect of it though is how it skews the theatricality of such tyrants. Hitler was all show and no substance. What Chaplin does is brutally and often hilariously parody the theatrics behind the Nazi regime. Hitler's greatest power is in how he was able to generate emotion through his grandiose speeches. I've seen the Riefenstahl pictures and to be honest they scare me more than any horror film. Chaplin being the genius he was sees humor in them. It's obvious that Chaplin spent a great deal of time studying his subject as Hitler's mannerisms are copied to the tee and he outdoes himself in parodying them. The impersonation shows how silly the real thing was. I don't think it was ever Chaplin's intention to undermine the dangers of fascism. Adenoid Hynkel is a humorous and inept boob but he is a very real danger and Chaplin generates disgust from his audience as well as laughs. It is a credit to his tremendous skills as an actor and storyteller that he can balance these aspects of the character so well. There's a fiery and aggressive violent streak in Hynkel and he is capable of terrible things and yet we see him for what he really is, a bully who hides his awkwardness and insecurities with his violent fascist views. The Little Tramp is as charming and lovable as ever. I know there is debate as to whether or not the Jewish Barber is the final incantation of Chaplin's tramp and as a Chaplin fan I believe that he absolutely is and that 'The Great Dictator' is Chaplin's 'killing off' the character. The Tramp was always a reflection of the times he lived in and Chaplin did not alter the times to fit comedy. He put his Tramp in situations that showed how ugly the world could be. The Tramp is always a victim of the worst society has to offer it's poor and huddled masses. In 'The Great Dictator' the Tramp has encountered the pinnacle of ugliness man kind is capable of. Chaplin is still as funny as ever but it is shocking to see the Tramp do his slapstick in the streets where 'JEW' is painted on windows or when he plays hot potato with weapons designed to decimate and maim. This could have been a very depressing movie and yet it is heart warming and hopeful because the Tramp always represents faith in the goodness of mankind. Chaplin's speech at the end is a condemnation of fascism to be sure but it is also a eulogy to the tramp and what he stood for. Chaplin absolutely earned the right to such a speech despite it's theatricality because it perfectly sums up the Tramp's entire story. You must have faith in a better tomorrow and most importantly in your self. I think through comedy we have gotten the truest depiction of what Hitler really was. Too many times artists want to portray him as evil incarnate. If Hitler was evil incarnate than the inexcusable Holocaust has an excuse. 'The Great Dictator' and Chaplin's performance bring him out into the open. Hitler was a damn fool

    In Tomania(Germany), dictator Hynkel(Chaplin, doing a fantastic job aping and subverting Hitler's(both he and Mussolini are reduced to spoilt children, screaming when they don't get their way, with their world-altering war decisions being nothing more than them stroking their own egos... an all too true breakdown of many major despots) mannerisms, shouting nonsense speeches and short temper) has a doppelganger in a poor, kind Jewish barber(the contrast he creates between these is compelling) - and the fact that the two look the same, yet are treated so differently is one of numerous clever, and often subtle, comments on the ideology. The writing reveals a thorough understanding of the thinking, reasoning and actions of the Nazis. Sure, there are details that are changed or the like, forgivably to ease the story-telling, to make a point, etc. There are also other types of comedy; mocking and black humor is used to remove the sting from the fear of the shells, army and the mistreatment of the children of Israel. And that last one is treated seriously, as well. The tone will switch very effectively, and suddenly we are afraid of something similar to what we've just been chuckling at. This way, the reality doesn't become lost, and one can sense the actual threat of persecution and foreign invasion right underneath it all. The smart references, including some that, at the time, not everyone would have known enough to get, are mixed in with simpler material. While the slapstick can be rather inspired, the wordplays are on the nose(Italy becomes Bacteria... those don't even sound alike...), and there is the occasional half-baked gag, abandoned as quickly and abruptly as it is begun. This is swiftly paced, and the 120 minute running time tends to go by smoothly(if the narrative jumps awkwardly once or twice). Acting is strong for all concerned, both the broad gesturing and the finer nuances(Goddard is charming, inspiring and memorable as the outspoken Hannah). There is a little violent and disturbing content in this. I recommend this to everyone who appreciates satire dealing with tragedy. 9/10

    Charlie Chaplin's boldest film for its willingness to take on Adolf Hitler before nearly anyone else, "The Great Dictator" was also Chaplin taking on sound 11 years after everyone else. If it had to be the end of cinema's greatest Silent Clown, he did what he could to take down history's greatest monster in the process. There are two reasons to like "The Great Dictator." One is that Chaplin was on the side of the angels, at no small risk given his target's ambitions. The other is he didn't forget to make it funny. Essentially a Prince And The Pauper remake, "Dictator" presents Chaplin as both Adenoid Hynkel, the cruel if inept "Phooey" (a. k. a. "F&uuml;hrer") of Tomainia, and a Jewish World War I veteran, poignantly left unnamed as a nod to the Common Man, who only wants to work in peace at his barber shop. While Hynkel struggles with his two great passions, hating Jews and loving war, the barber finds love and a cause to believe in. The comedy here can be categorized into the great and the good, with most of the former featuring Chaplin as Hynkel. He's simply much funnier here as the bad guy, whether playing it broad (jumping secretaries, delivering speeches in hate-choked gobbledegook) or subtle (after shooting dead a man who claims to have "perfected" a bullet-proof suit, Hynkel simply turns and walks away with a three-word critique: "Far from perfect.") Hynkel is a character who solves Chaplin's legendary problem with sound, whether dressing down his blubbering subordinate Herring (Billy Gilbert) or struggling to keep his composure when fellow dictator Napaloni (Jack Oakie) rebuffs his attempts at intimidation. Told by his right-hand man Garbitsch (Henry Daniell) that the people are objecting to sawdust in the bread, he huffs: "What more do they want? It's from the finest lumber our mills can supply!" The comedy around the barber gets more labored. Maybe it's because much of it turns on the oppression of the Jews, though Chaplin here is trying to establish them as underdogs and rooting interest. It's here the film becomes tricky, not because he is mocking the unmockable but because the characters we meet, including the Barber, are fairly bland and the humor patchy. There is some very funny material here, but excessive bits too where people get klonked with pans or splattered with whitewash. At least Chaplin avoided setting a pie fight in a starving ghetto. The famous last scene is a great divider for many; in it Chaplin steps out of character to address us the audience about...what? The world needs more love and less hate, I guess. It's a philosophically strangled message, both anti-fascist and oddly pacifistic at a time when Hitler's legions were swallowing Europe, with Chaplin warning of "machine men with machine minds" as if he was still making "Modern Times" and punching the sky at times for lame effect. To me it's a crass way to end a good comedy, if perhaps necessary given the stakes involved. Hitler was real, and calling him out for what he was had real value in terms of rallying those called upon to defeat him. If it doesn't transcend time as well as it could, "The Great Dictator" is still a fine comedy that delivers strong laughs and stronger historical resonances.

Like those chase scenes when the Schulz troopers are after him." "Schulz." Kristl laughed. "What?" "It is a funny name as it means guilt in German. It is an apt name because Schulz saves the Jewish barber because he owes him for saving his life, but later on he feel guilt because he has supported Hynkel. I wonder if Chaplin was deliberate in that." "Might be." Henry said, "I found most of the story somewhat dull and sometimes strange. Like when nobody sees the similarity between Hynkel and the Jewish barber. Also it has a nice feel about it. Like those Nazi were not nice people, but the it is probably meant as a slapstick. So it had to be nice." Kristl nodded, "The story has it's odd twist and turns. Like that Hynkel and the Jewish barber switch roles. It is as if he mixed two kind of movies. A serious movie and a slapstick movie." "It might be.. I found it a bit long in the tooth." Henry yawned. "Still it remains a masterpiece." "Ah" "It is a tribute to the belief that we are all humans, each and everyone of us, and that we could live in peace. The end speech is often felt as an awkward long statement.. but it is here that you feel Chaplin shoving aside the movie and directly addresses the viewer. It was of course not done and it must have felt embarrassing by many to be directly talked to. As a method of movie making it was seldom seen in a normal movie. It clearly brought out the idea that you can invoke a strong emotion by directly talking into the camera and the audience." "And that makes it a masterpiece?" "That and his direct appeal to humanity."

    The Great Dictator is a break nick comedy that satirizes Hitler like no other film maker in history has ever dared or will ever dare. Of course Charlie Chaplin would have never made the movie, if he knew how things were going to turn out. The movie has some of the funniest scenes i have ever seen but it also finds itself in Drama, specially the last speech. This last speech, which many believe to be the weakness of the movie, is the most important of them all. He was asked by executives to cut the part out but he was determined to keep it since he knew the seriousness of the matter. Chaplin said he would have given anything to know how Hitler felt about it. I too would have given anything to know too but i also read, from IMDb FAQ, that Hitler saw it twice. It must have interested him in some level.......

    The Great Dictator is a funny, charming and witty film, with excellent performances, especially from Charlie Chaplin and his wife, Paulette Goddard. But it's not all about comedy; behind the laughters lies a critique of the war and how pointless, damaging and inhuman it is. It shows the situation of the Jewish people, who were often abused and ridiculized by the German army. It satirizes the greed and lust for power of Mussolini and Hitler, who most of the time act like children and not like grown-up adults, fighting with each other for the biggest piece of cake. The ending of the film is, without a doubt, one of the most beautiful I have ever seen. I guess that, at this point, most people know a word or two of the famous speech. It was so heart-felt, human and splendid I couldn't help but cry. The Great Dictator is a film that is not to be missed.

    Chaplin's 'The Great Dictator' is a masterpiece whose only fault is that even Chaplin could not imagine the horrors Adolf Hitler was capable of. It is a very funny film about the darkest horrors of modern history. Chaplin was a comedic genius and 'The Great Dictator' is in my humble opinion, his finest hour. There is no greater creative feat than to take the powerful oppressor and strip him of all his power through art. Chaplin's take on Hitler strips him of all his power. The greater clown was and always will be Adolf Hitler for his reprehensible evil views which Chaplin shows through his humor were incredibly stupid as well. 'The Great Dictator' is very much a film of it's time. Chaplin apparently said that he would not have made it had he known the extent of the atrocities committed by the Nazi. Indeed some of the film has a certain creepiness because we know what we know. I still sort of grimace a bit with the subplot involving the banker Epstein and Hynkel's temporary flirtation with the Jews. The timeless aspect of it though is how it skews the theatricality of such tyrants. Hitler was all show and no substance. What Chaplin does is brutally and often hilariously parody the theatrics behind the Nazi regime. Hitler's greatest power is in how he was able to generate emotion through his grandiose speeches. I've seen the Riefenstahl pictures and to be honest they scare me more than any horror film. Chaplin being the genius he was sees humor in them. It's obvious that Chaplin spent a great deal of time studying his subject as Hitler's mannerisms are copied to the tee and he outdoes himself in parodying them. The impersonation shows how silly the real thing was. I don't think it was ever Chaplin's intention to undermine the dangers of fascism. Adenoid Hynkel is a humorous and inept boob but he is a very real danger and Chaplin generates disgust from his audience as well as laughs. It is a credit to his tremendous skills as an actor and storyteller that he can balance these aspects of the character so well. There's a fiery and aggressive violent streak in Hynkel and he is capable of terrible things and yet we see him for what he really is, a bully who hides his awkwardness and insecurities with his violent fascist views. The Little Tramp is as charming and lovable as ever. I know there is debate as to whether or not the Jewish Barber is the final incantation of Chaplin's tramp and as a Chaplin fan I believe that he absolutely is and that 'The Great Dictator' is Chaplin's 'killing off' the character. The Tramp was always a reflection of the times he lived in and Chaplin did not alter the times to fit comedy. He put his Tramp in situations that showed how ugly the world could be. The Tramp is always a victim of the worst society has to offer it's poor and huddled masses. In 'The Great Dictator' the Tramp has encountered the pinnacle of ugliness man kind is capable of. Chaplin is still as funny as ever but it is shocking to see the Tramp do his slapstick in the streets where 'JEW' is painted on windows or when he plays hot potato with weapons designed to decimate and maim. This could have been a very depressing movie and yet it is heart warming and hopeful because the Tramp always represents faith in the goodness of mankind. Chaplin's speech at the end is a condemnation of fascism to be sure but it is also a eulogy to the tramp and what he stood for. Chaplin absolutely earned the right to such a speech despite it's theatricality because it perfectly sums up the Tramp's entire story. You must have faith in a better tomorrow and most importantly in your self. I think through comedy we have gotten the truest depiction of what Hitler really was. Too many times artists want to portray him as evil incarnate. If Hitler was evil incarnate than the inexcusable Holocaust has an excuse. 'The Great Dictator' and Chaplin's performance bring him out into the open. Hitler was a damn fool

    In Tomania(Germany), dictator Hynkel(Chaplin, doing a fantastic job aping and subverting Hitler's(both he and Mussolini are reduced to spoilt children, screaming when they don't get their way, with their world-altering war decisions being nothing more than them stroking their own egos... an all too true breakdown of many major despots) mannerisms, shouting nonsense speeches and short temper) has a doppelganger in a poor, kind Jewish barber(the contrast he creates between these is compelling) - and the fact that the two look the same, yet are treated so differently is one of numerous clever, and often subtle, comments on the ideology. The writing reveals a thorough understanding of the thinking, reasoning and actions of the Nazis. Sure, there are details that are changed or the like, forgivably to ease the story-telling, to make a point, etc. There are also other types of comedy; mocking and black humor is used to remove the sting from the fear of the shells, army and the mistreatment of the children of Israel. And that last one is treated seriously, as well. The tone will switch very effectively, and suddenly we are afraid of something similar to what we've just been chuckling at. This way, the reality doesn't become lost, and one can sense the actual threat of persecution and foreign invasion right underneath it all. The smart references, including some that, at the time, not everyone would have known enough to get, are mixed in with simpler material. While the slapstick can be rather inspired, the wordplays are on the nose(Italy becomes Bacteria... those don't even sound alike...), and there is the occasional half-baked gag, abandoned as quickly and abruptly as it is begun. This is swiftly paced, and the 120 minute running time tends to go by smoothly(if the narrative jumps awkwardly once or twice). Acting is strong for all concerned, both the broad gesturing and the finer nuances(Goddard is charming, inspiring and memorable as the outspoken Hannah). There is a little violent and disturbing content in this. I recommend this to everyone who appreciates satire dealing with tragedy. 9/10

    Charlie Chaplin's boldest film for its willingness to take on Adolf Hitler before nearly anyone else, "The Great Dictator" was also Chaplin taking on sound 11 years after everyone else. If it had to be the end of cinema's greatest Silent Clown, he did what he could to take down history's greatest monster in the process. There are two reasons to like "The Great Dictator." One is that Chaplin was on the side of the angels, at no small risk given his target's ambitions. The other is he didn't forget to make it funny. Essentially a Prince And The Pauper remake, "Dictator" presents Chaplin as both Adenoid Hynkel, the cruel if inept "Phooey" (a. k. a. "F&uuml;hrer") of Tomainia, and a Jewish World War I veteran, poignantly left unnamed as a nod to the Common Man, who only wants to work in peace at his barber shop. While Hynkel struggles with his two great passions, hating Jews and loving war, the barber finds love and a cause to believe in. The comedy here can be categorized into the great and the good, with most of the former featuring Chaplin as Hynkel. He's simply much funnier here as the bad guy, whether playing it broad (jumping secretaries, delivering speeches in hate-choked gobbledegook) or subtle (after shooting dead a man who claims to have "perfected" a bullet-proof suit, Hynkel simply turns and walks away with a three-word critique: "Far from perfect.") Hynkel is a character who solves Chaplin's legendary problem with sound, whether dressing down his blubbering subordinate Herring (Billy Gilbert) or struggling to keep his composure when fellow dictator Napaloni (Jack Oakie) rebuffs his attempts at intimidation. Told by his right-hand man Garbitsch (Henry Daniell) that the people are objecting to sawdust in the bread, he huffs: "What more do they want? It's from the finest lumber our mills can supply!" The comedy around the barber gets more labored. Maybe it's because much of it turns on the oppression of the Jews, though Chaplin here is trying to establish them as underdogs and rooting interest. It's here the film becomes tricky, not because he is mocking the unmockable but because the characters we meet, including the Barber, are fairly bland and the humor patchy. There is some very funny material here, but excessive bits too where people get klonked with pans or splattered with whitewash. At least Chaplin avoided setting a pie fight in a starving ghetto. The famous last scene is a great divider for many; in it Chaplin steps out of character to address us the audience about...what? The world needs more love and less hate, I guess. It's a philosophically strangled message, both anti-fascist and oddly pacifistic at a time when Hitler's legions were swallowing Europe, with Chaplin warning of "machine men with machine minds" as if he was still making "Modern Times" and punching the sky at times for lame effect. To me it's a crass way to end a good comedy, if perhaps necessary given the stakes involved. Hitler was real, and calling him out for what he was had real value in terms of rallying those called upon to defeat him. If it doesn't transcend time as well as it could, "The Great Dictator" is still a fine comedy that delivers strong laughs and stronger historical resonances.

    Easy to sneer now - but think 1940. Chaplin's three-minute sermon at the end of this film can sound like every brotherly-love clich&eacute; rolled into one, as well as being technically dubious - bolted-on, rather than crafted into the action, and implausible anyway, coming from the lips of a humble barber. But unlike any other, 1940 was a year full of despair for the world, and an appeal for optimism from the Little Tramp, never downhearted for long, must have provided a ray of hope for millions, when it was most needed. "The hate of men will pass." Dare to believe it... Mistaken identity is not exactly the most original storyline either, but Chaplin makes good use of it in his dual role as Hynkel (Hitler) and an unnamed Jewish barber in the ghetto. The action starts in 1918, with the collapse of the Tomanian (German) army, and the barber saving the life of a wounded pilot, but losing his own memory through concussion. Fast-forward twenty years, and the barber escapes from his care-home, to return to the ghetto, now governed by stormtroopers reporting to... none other than the ex-pilot, who is secretly planning a resistance movement. The political background is the Anschluss (invasion of Austria) where Hynkel is competing for influence with an obvious Mussolini figure, played with gusto by Jack Oakie. Owing to some fairly contrived twists, the barber and the pilot find themselves pursued by the law, and happen to arrive at the Austrian border in uniform, just as Hynkel, out duck-shooting in civilian clothes, gets arrested in error. So a huge parade, waiting to be addressed by Hynkel, gets the barber's speech instead, and they all cheer the message of peace. This was only Chaplin's first talkie, and some of its best scenes owe much to silent technique, such as his dance with an inflatable globe, and other sequences that are almost mime with music. Work had started on this film in 1937, and Britain and America were both planning to boycott it, for the sake of their neutrality. It is to Chaplin's credit that he risked his career, as well as his own capital, in pressing ahead with such a vast commitment. But his political naivety always showed, as when someone suggested he should make a similar film about Stalin. "It is hard to play a man who has no faults", came the astonishing reply. Finally, no report on The Great Dictator is complete without some verdict about Hitler's own rumoured screening of it. Two prints were acquired from Portugal and delivered to the F&uuml;hrer's private cinema. Albert Speer declared that Hitler never saw the film - but he couldn't strictly have known. Some say he watched it twice in total silence and made no reaction. Chaplin said he would give anything to know what he thought of it.

    Unforgettable political satire that was tumultuously topical and cannot be realized today with any real assimilation of place and time. It was a brave and biting commentary on the Headlines of the day and prophetically postured what was to be uncovered. A marvelous and unsettling, in retrospect, account of the marching goose-steps of Gestapo tactics and unnatural Nationalism and Fascism. In 1940 this was funny, as it is today, but in just a short time after its release its subject matter could only elicit nervous, under the breath, reluctant half-smiles. It is a graceful and searing poke in the eye at a megalomaniacal Leader of a Sheeple population that was mesmerized by psychological tricks and economic persuasion. A suffering Nation transformed into a War Machine through pomp and circumstance. The Film and its Director held little back as it made an attempt at shedding some light on the absurdities yet to be unveiled. This is a Masterpiece, high Art in its relevance and in hindsight a predetermined cry-out for sanity in what was becoming a completely unhinged and insane World. There are many laughs here as well as intellectual insights and it is all so well produced and perceived that it remains today a testament to Humanity's struggle to stay relatively Human in inhuman situations. There is hardly a false note here and this can be regarded as one of the most poignant views and commentaries on the forces of Evil ever seen through the lens of Motion Picture prognostications and empathetic concerns. One of the best from one of the best...Charlie Chaplin.

    Released on the big screen on October 15, 1940, the film is a satire of Charlie Chaplin at Hitler, in which a Jew is chosen to be the double of the dictator Adenoid Hynkel, who chairs the state Toman. A poor Jewish barber is arrested by the Nazis and taken to the camp with his friend, a former Tomanian soldier arrested for being too friendly with the Jews. More in jest, half seriously, someone once tried to prove that Chaplin made ​​The Great Dictator because Hitler copied his famous mustache. Leaving aside witticism, Chaplin remains among the first timely angry filmmakers, up to an unprecedented pamphleteer explosion in the American film, of all that means fascist constraint in individual lives and the community.

    One of the most controversial films of its time, The Great Dictator is Charlie Chaplin's satirical take on Adolf Hitler and his ideals. This is Charlie Chaplin's first talkie and doesn't portray Chaplin making a joke out of everything since the moments of laughter in this film are nicely blended with stark drama and makes a bold statement in the final moments that resonates all race, borders & boundaries and with its universal message connects with everyone. Highly entertaining, brilliantly structured & superbly performed, immensely enjoyable and presenting Chaplin in the role of both a Jew and a dictator, thus giving him more dimensions to explore, The Great Dictator is one of the many comedy classics that has only grown in stature with passing time. The last 5 minutes of this film alone creates far more impact than many other films trying to deliver the same message with their 2-hour plus runtime and Chaplin truly nailed that scene with his now prominent speech that wraps this film up. Overall, a daring, important & remarkable work from, arguably, the greatest cinematic personality to have ever lived.

"Figured an commie like you would name Modern Times." Henry smiled. "Eh?" "You mentioned Modern Times. A commie would like it. The movie is just an attack on capitalism." "Uhm. Commie? Well.. let's talk about that in due time." "On with Hitler.. eh The Great Dictator." Henry said. "I bet he couldn't laugh about it, but I wonder.. would Mussolini have laughed about it?" "I bet not. I bet that people who are dictators can't laugh about themselves, if they could they wouldn't be dictators." Henry said. "Wow.. that is an observation of life." " I can observe life as well as anyone else can." "I bet." "So a masterpiece?" "Yes and no." "Yes and no?"

While the slapstick can be rather inspired, the wordplays are on the nose(Italy becomes Bacteria... those don't even sound alike...), and there is the occasional half-baked gag, abandoned as quickly and abruptly as it is begun. This is swiftly paced, and the 120 minute running time tends to go by smoothly(if the narrative jumps awkwardly once or twice). Acting is strong for all concerned, both the broad gesturing and the finer nuances(Goddard is charming, inspiring and memorable as the outspoken Hannah). There is a little violent and disturbing content in this. I recommend this to everyone who appreciates satire dealing with tragedy. 9/10

    Charlie Chaplin's boldest film for its willingness to take on Adolf Hitler before nearly anyone else, "The Great Dictator" was also Chaplin taking on sound 11 years after everyone else. If it had to be the end of cinema's greatest Silent Clown, he did what he could to take down history's greatest monster in the process. There are two reasons to like "The Great Dictator." One is that Chaplin was on the side of the angels, at no small risk given his target's ambitions. The other is he didn't forget to make it funny. Essentially a Prince And The Pauper remake, "Dictator" presents Chaplin as both Adenoid Hynkel, the cruel if inept "Phooey" (a. k. a. "F&uuml;hrer") of Tomainia, and a Jewish World War I veteran, poignantly left unnamed as a nod to the Common Man, who only wants to work in peace at his barber shop. While Hynkel struggles with his two great passions, hating Jews and loving war, the barber finds love and a cause to believe in. The comedy here can be categorized into the great and the good, with most of the former featuring Chaplin as Hynkel. He's simply much funnier here as the bad guy, whether playing it broad (jumping secretaries, delivering speeches in hate-choked gobbledegook) or subtle (after shooting dead a man who claims to have "perfected" a bullet-proof suit, Hynkel simply turns and walks away with a three-word critique: "Far from perfect.") Hynkel is a character who solves Chaplin's legendary problem with sound, whether dressing down his blubbering subordinate Herring (Billy Gilbert) or struggling to keep his composure when fellow dictator Napaloni (Jack Oakie) rebuffs his attempts at intimidation. Told by his right-hand man Garbitsch (Henry Daniell) that the people are objecting to sawdust in the bread, he huffs: "What more do they want? It's from the finest lumber our mills can supply!" The comedy around the barber gets more labored. Maybe it's because much of it turns on the oppression of the Jews, though Chaplin here is trying to establish them as underdogs and rooting interest. It's here the film becomes tricky, not because he is mocking the unmockable but because the characters we meet, including the Barber, are fairly bland and the humor patchy. There is some very funny material here, but excessive bits too where people get klonked with pans or splattered with whitewash. At least Chaplin avoided setting a pie fight in a starving ghetto. The famous last scene is a great divider for many; in it Chaplin steps out of character to address us the audience about...what? The world needs more love and less hate, I guess. It's a philosophically strangled message, both anti-fascist and oddly pacifistic at a time when Hitler's legions were swallowing Europe, with Chaplin warning of "machine men with machine minds" as if he was still making "Modern Times" and punching the sky at times for lame effect. To me it's a crass way to end a good comedy, if perhaps necessary given the stakes involved. Hitler was real, and calling him out for what he was had real value in terms of rallying those called upon to defeat him. If it doesn't transcend time as well as it could, "The Great Dictator" is still a fine comedy that delivers strong laughs and stronger historical resonances.

    Easy to sneer now - but think 1940. Chaplin's three-minute sermon at the end of this film can sound like every brotherly-love clich&eacute; rolled into one, as well as being technically dubious - bolted-on, rather than crafted into the action, and implausible anyway, coming from the lips of a humble barber. But unlike any other, 1940 was a year full of despair for the world, and an appeal for optimism from the Little Tramp, never downhearted for long, must have provided a ray of hope for millions, when it was most needed. "The hate of men will pass." Dare to believe it... Mistaken identity is not exactly the most original storyline either, but Chaplin makes good use of it in his dual role as Hynkel (Hitler) and an unnamed Jewish barber in the ghetto. The action starts in 1918, with the collapse of the Tomanian (German) army, and the barber saving the life of a wounded pilot, but losing his own memory through concussion. Fast-forward twenty years, and the barber escapes from his care-home, to return to the ghetto, now governed by stormtroopers reporting to... none other than the ex-pilot, who is secretly planning a resistance movement. The political background is the Anschluss (invasion of Austria) where Hynkel is competing for influence with an obvious Mussolini figure, played with gusto by Jack Oakie. Owing to some fairly contrived twists, the barber and the pilot find themselves pursued by the law, and happen to arrive at the Austrian border in uniform, just as Hynkel, out duck-shooting in civilian clothes, gets arrested in error. So a huge parade, waiting to be addressed by Hynkel, gets the barber's speech instead, and they all cheer the message of peace. This was only Chaplin's first talkie, and some of its best scenes owe much to silent technique, such as his dance with an inflatable globe, and other sequences that are almost mime with music. Work had started on this film in 1937, and Britain and America were both planning to boycott it, for the sake of their neutrality. It is to Chaplin's credit that he risked his career, as well as his own capital, in pressing ahead with such a vast commitment. But his political naivety always showed, as when someone suggested he should make a similar film about Stalin. "It is hard to play a man who has no faults", came the astonishing reply. Finally, no report on The Great Dictator is complete without some verdict about Hitler's own rumoured screening of it. Two prints were acquired from Portugal and delivered to the F&uuml;hrer's private cinema. Albert Speer declared that Hitler never saw the film - but he couldn't strictly have known. Some say he watched it twice in total silence and made no reaction. Chaplin said he would give anything to know what he thought of it.

    Unforgettable political satire that was tumultuously topical and cannot be realized today with any real assimilation of place and time. It was a brave and biting commentary on the Headlines of the day and prophetically postured what was to be uncovered. A marvelous and unsettling, in retrospect, account of the marching goose-steps of Gestapo tactics and unnatural Nationalism and Fascism. In 1940 this was funny, as it is today, but in just a short time after its release its subject matter could only elicit nervous, under the breath, reluctant half-smiles. It is a graceful and searing poke in the eye at a megalomaniacal Leader of a Sheeple population that was mesmerized by psychological tricks and economic persuasion. A suffering Nation transformed into a War Machine through pomp and circumstance. The Film and its Director held little back as it made an attempt at shedding some light on the absurdities yet to be unveiled. This is a Masterpiece, high Art in its relevance and in hindsight a predetermined cry-out for sanity in what was becoming a completely unhinged and insane World. There are many laughs here as well as intellectual insights and it is all so well produced and perceived that it remains today a testament to Humanity's struggle to stay relatively Human in inhuman situations. There is hardly a false note here and this can be regarded as one of the most poignant views and commentaries on the forces of Evil ever seen through the lens of Motion Picture prognostications and empathetic concerns. One of the best from one of the best...Charlie Chaplin.

    Released on the big screen on October 15, 1940, the film is a satire of Charlie Chaplin at Hitler, in which a Jew is chosen to be the double of the dictator Adenoid Hynkel, who chairs the state Toman. A poor Jewish barber is arrested by the Nazis and taken to the camp with his friend, a former Tomanian soldier arrested for being too friendly with the Jews. More in jest, half seriously, someone once tried to prove that Chaplin made ​​The Great Dictator because Hitler copied his famous mustache. Leaving aside witticism, Chaplin remains among the first timely angry filmmakers, up to an unprecedented pamphleteer explosion in the American film, of all that means fascist constraint in individual lives and the community.

    One of the most controversial films of its time, The Great Dictator is Charlie Chaplin's satirical take on Adolf Hitler and his ideals. This is Charlie Chaplin's first talkie and doesn't portray Chaplin making a joke out of everything since the moments of laughter in this film are nicely blended with stark drama and makes a bold statement in the final moments that resonates all race, borders & boundaries and with its universal message connects with everyone. Highly entertaining, brilliantly structured & superbly performed, immensely enjoyable and presenting Chaplin in the role of both a Jew and a dictator, thus giving him more dimensions to explore, The Great Dictator is one of the many comedy classics that has only grown in stature with passing time. The last 5 minutes of this film alone creates far more impact than many other films trying to deliver the same message with their 2-hour plus runtime and Chaplin truly nailed that scene with his now prominent speech that wraps this film up. Overall, a daring, important & remarkable work from, arguably, the greatest cinematic personality to have ever lived.

    "Chaplin's masterpiece?" Henry asked. "Uh. Modern Times is a good movie too. There are also others. Like The tramp and I belief...eh" "City Lights?" "That one." "The Kid?" "Oh.. I guess." "Figured an commie like you would name Modern Times." Henry smiled. "Eh?" "You mentioned Modern Times. A commie would like it. The movie is just an attack on capitalism." "Uhm. Commie? Well.. let's talk about that in due time." "On with Hitler.. eh The Great Dictator." Henry said. "I bet he couldn't laugh about it, but I wonder.. would Mussolini have laughed about it?" "I bet not. I bet that people who are dictators can't laugh about themselves, if they could they wouldn't be dictators." Henry said. "Wow.. that is an observation of life." " I can observe life as well as anyone else can." "I bet." "So a masterpiece?" "Yes and no." "Yes and no?" "Well it's a masterpiece in the way it is made and what it is about and the statement Chaplin makes. That makes it an unique movie." "But it is also a long slapstick movie, which has it's moments at times, like when Hinkel and Napaloni meet, but still feels like a bit old fashioned even in the 1940. Like those chase scenes when the Schulz troopers are after him." "Schulz." Kristl laughed. "What?" "It is a funny name as it means guilt in German. It is an apt name because Schulz saves the Jewish barber because he owes him for saving his life, but later on he feel guilt because he has supported Hynkel. I wonder if Chaplin was deliberate in that." "Might be." Henry said, "I found most of the story somewhat dull and sometimes strange. Like when nobody sees the similarity between Hynkel and the Jewish barber. Also it has a nice feel about it. Like those Nazi were not nice people, but the it is probably meant as a slapstick. So it had to be nice." Kristl nodded, "The story has it's odd twist and turns. Like that Hynkel and the Jewish barber switch roles. It is as if he mixed two kind of movies. A serious movie and a slapstick movie." "It might be.. I found it a bit long in the tooth." Henry yawned. "Still it remains a masterpiece." "Ah" "It is a tribute to the belief that we are all humans, each and everyone of us, and that we could live in peace. The end speech is often felt as an awkward long statement.. but it is here that you feel Chaplin shoving aside the movie and directly addresses the viewer. It was of course not done and it must have felt embarrassing by many to be directly talked to. As a method of movie making it was seldom seen in a normal movie. It clearly brought out the idea that you can invoke a strong emotion by directly talking into the camera and the audience." "And that makes it a masterpiece?" "That and his direct appeal to humanity."

    The Great Dictator is a break nick comedy that satirizes Hitler like no other film maker in history has ever dared or will ever dare. Of course Charlie Chaplin would have never made the movie, if he knew how things were going to turn out. The movie has some of the funniest scenes i have ever seen but it also finds itself in Drama, specially the last speech. This last speech, which many believe to be the weakness of the movie, is the most important of them all. He was asked by executives to cut the part out but he was determined to keep it since he knew the seriousness of the matter. Chaplin said he would have given anything to know how Hitler felt about it. I too would have given anything to know too but i also read, from IMDb FAQ, that Hitler saw it twice. It must have interested him in some level.......

    The Great Dictator is a funny, charming and witty film, with excellent performances, especially from Charlie Chaplin and his wife, Paulette Goddard. But it's not all about comedy; behind the laughters lies a critique of the war and how pointless, damaging and inhuman it is. It shows the situation of the Jewish people, who were often abused and ridiculized by the German army. It satirizes the greed and lust for power of Mussolini and Hitler, who most of the time act like children and not like grown-up adults, fighting with each other for the biggest piece of cake. The ending of the film is, without a doubt, one of the most beautiful I have ever seen. I guess that, at this point, most people know a word or two of the famous speech. It was so heart-felt, human and splendid I couldn't help but cry. The Great Dictator is a film that is not to be missed.

    Chaplin's 'The Great Dictator' is a masterpiece whose only fault is that even Chaplin could not imagine the horrors Adolf Hitler was capable of. It is a very funny film about the darkest horrors of modern history. Chaplin was a comedic genius and 'The Great Dictator' is in my humble opinion, his finest hour. There is no greater creative feat than to take the powerful oppressor and strip him of all his power through art. Chaplin's take on Hitler strips him of all his power. The greater clown was and always will be Adolf Hitler for his reprehensible evil views which Chaplin shows through his humor were incredibly stupid as well. 'The Great Dictator' is very much a film of it's time. Chaplin apparently said that he would not have made it had he known the extent of the atrocities committed by the Nazi. Indeed some of the film has a certain creepiness because we know what we know. I still sort of grimace a bit with the subplot involving the banker Epstein and Hynkel's temporary flirtation with the Jews. The timeless aspect of it though is how it skews the theatricality of such tyrants. Hitler was all show and no substance. What Chaplin does is brutally and often hilariously parody the theatrics behind the Nazi regime. Hitler's greatest power is in how he was able to generate emotion through his grandiose speeches. I've seen the Riefenstahl pictures and to be honest they scare me more than any horror film. Chaplin being the genius he was sees humor in them. It's obvious that Chaplin spent a great deal of time studying his subject as Hitler's mannerisms are copied to the tee and he outdoes himself in parodying them. The impersonation shows how silly the real thing was. I don't think it was ever Chaplin's intention to undermine the dangers of fascism. Adenoid Hynkel is a humorous and inept boob but he is a very real danger and Chaplin generates disgust from his audience as well as laughs. It is a credit to his tremendous skills as an actor and storyteller that he can balance these aspects of the character so well. There's a fiery and aggressive violent streak in Hynkel and he is capable of terrible things and yet we see him for what he really is, a bully who hides his awkwardness and insecurities with his violent fascist views. The Little Tramp is as charming and lovable as ever. I know there is debate as to whether or not the Jewish Barber is the final incantation of Chaplin's tramp and as a Chaplin fan I believe that he absolutely is and that 'The Great Dictator' is Chaplin's 'killing off' the character. The Tramp was always a reflection of the times he lived in and Chaplin did not alter the times to fit comedy. He put his Tramp in situations that showed how ugly the world could be. The Tramp is always a victim of the worst society has to offer it's poor and huddled masses. In 'The Great Dictator' the Tramp has encountered the pinnacle of ugliness man kind is capable of. Chaplin is still as funny as ever but it is shocking to see the Tramp do his slapstick in the streets where 'JEW' is painted on windows or when he plays hot potato with weapons designed to decimate and maim. This could have been a very depressing movie and yet it is heart warming and hopeful because the Tramp always represents faith in the goodness of mankind. Chaplin's speech at the end is a condemnation of fascism to be sure but it is also a eulogy to the tramp and what he stood for. Chaplin absolutely earned the right to such a speech despite it's theatricality because it perfectly sums up the Tramp's entire story. You must have faith in a better tomorrow and most importantly in your self. I think through comedy we have gotten the truest depiction of what Hitler really was. Too many times artists want to portray him as evil incarnate. If Hitler was evil incarnate than the inexcusable Holocaust has an excuse. 'The Great Dictator' and Chaplin's performance bring him out into the open. Hitler was a damn fool

    In Tomania(Germany), dictator Hynkel(Chaplin, doing a fantastic job aping and subverting Hitler's(both he and Mussolini are reduced to spoilt children, screaming when they don't get their way, with their world-altering war decisions being nothing more than them stroking their own egos... an all too true breakdown of many major despots) mannerisms, shouting nonsense speeches and short temper) has a doppelganger in a poor, kind Jewish barber(the contrast he creates between these is compelling) - and the fact that the two look the same, yet are treated so differently is one of numerous clever, and often subtle, comments on the ideology. The writing reveals a thorough understanding of the thinking, reasoning and actions of the Nazis. Sure, there are details that are changed or the like, forgivably to ease the story-telling, to make a point, etc. There are also other types of comedy; mocking and black humor is used to remove the sting from the fear of the shells, army and the mistreatment of the children of Israel. And that last one is treated seriously, as well. The tone will switch very effectively, and suddenly we are afraid of something similar to what we've just been chuckling at. This way, the reality doesn't become lost, and one can sense the actual threat of persecution and foreign invasion right underneath it all. The smart references, including some that, at the time, not everyone would have known enough to get, are mixed in with simpler material. While the slapstick can be rather inspired, the wordplays are on the nose(Italy becomes Bacteria... those don't even sound alike...), and there is the occasional half-baked gag, abandoned as quickly and abruptly as it is begun. This is swiftly paced, and the 120 minute running time tends to go by smoothly(if the narrative jumps awkwardly once or twice). Acting is strong for all concerned, both the broad gesturing and the finer nuances(Goddard is charming, inspiring and memorable as the outspoken Hannah). There is a little violent and disturbing content in this. I recommend this to everyone who appreciates satire dealing with tragedy. 9/10

    One of the most controversial films of its time, The Great Dictator is Charlie Chaplin's satirical take on Adolf Hitler and his ideals. This is Charlie Chaplin's first talkie and doesn't portray Chaplin making a joke out of everything since the moments of laughter in this film are nicely blended with stark drama and makes a bold statement in the final moments that resonates all race, borders & boundaries and with its universal message connects with everyone. Highly entertaining, brilliantly structured & superbly performed, immensely enjoyable and presenting Chaplin in the role of both a Jew and a dictator, thus giving him more dimensions to explore, The Great Dictator is one of the many comedy classics that has only grown in stature with passing time. The last 5 minutes of this film alone creates far more impact than many other films trying to deliver the same message with their 2-hour plus runtime and Chaplin truly nailed that scene with his now prominent speech that wraps this film up. Overall, a daring, important & remarkable work from, arguably, the greatest cinematic personality to have ever lived.

    "Chaplin's masterpiece?" Henry asked. "Uh. Modern Times is a good movie too. There are also others. Like The tramp and I belief...eh" "City Lights?" "That one." "The Kid?" "Oh.. I guess." "Figured an commie like you would name Modern Times." Henry smiled. "Eh?" "You mentioned Modern Times. A commie would like it. The movie is just an attack on capitalism." "Uhm. Commie? Well.. let's talk about that in due time." "On with Hitler.. eh The Great Dictator." Henry said. "I bet he couldn't laugh about it, but I wonder.. would Mussolini have laughed about it?" "I bet not. I bet that people who are dictators can't laugh about themselves, if they could they wouldn't be dictators." Henry said. "Wow.. that is an observation of life." " I can observe life as well as anyone else can." "I bet." "So a masterpiece?" "Yes and no." "Yes and no?" "Well it's a masterpiece in the way it is made and what it is about and the statement Chaplin makes. That makes it an unique movie." "But it is also a long slapstick movie, which has it's moments at times, like when Hinkel and Napaloni meet, but still feels like a bit old fashioned even in the 1940. Like those chase scenes when the Schulz troopers are after him." "Schulz." Kristl laughed. "What?" "It is a funny name as it means guilt in German. It is an apt name because Schulz saves the Jewish barber because he owes him for saving his life, but later on he feel guilt because he has supported Hynkel. I wonder if Chaplin was deliberate in that." "Might be." Henry said, "I found most of the story somewhat dull and sometimes strange. Like when nobody sees the similarity between Hynkel and the Jewish barber. Also it has a nice feel about it. Like those Nazi were not nice people, but the it is probably meant as a slapstick. So it had to be nice." Kristl nodded, "The story has it's odd twist and turns. Like that Hynkel and the Jewish barber switch roles. It is as if he mixed two kind of movies. A serious movie and a slapstick movie." "It might be.. I found it a bit long in the tooth." Henry yawned. "Still it remains a masterpiece." "Ah" "It is a tribute to the belief that we are all humans, each and everyone of us, and that we could live in peace. The end speech is often felt as an awkward long statement.. but it is here that you feel Chaplin shoving aside the movie and directly addresses the viewer. It was of course not done and it must have felt embarrassing by many to be directly talked to. As a method of movie making it was seldom seen in a normal movie. It clearly brought out the idea that you can invoke a strong emotion by directly talking into the camera and the audience." "And that makes it a masterpiece?" "That and his direct appeal to humanity."

    The Great Dictator is a break nick comedy that satirizes Hitler like no other film maker in history has ever dared or will ever dare. Of course Charlie Chaplin would have never made the movie, if he knew how things were going to turn out. The movie has some of the funniest scenes i have ever seen but it also finds itself in Drama, specially the last speech. This last speech, which many believe to be the weakness of the movie, is the most important of them all. He was asked by executives to cut the part out but he was determined to keep it since he knew the seriousness of the matter. Chaplin said he would have given anything to know how Hitler felt about it. I too would have given anything to know too but i also read, from IMDb FAQ, that Hitler saw it twice. It must have interested him in some level.......

    The Great Dictator is a funny, charming and witty film, with excellent performances, especially from Charlie Chaplin and his wife, Paulette Goddard. But it's not all about comedy; behind the laughters lies a critique of the war and how pointless, damaging and inhuman it is. It shows the situation of the Jewish people, who were often abused and ridiculized by the German army. It satirizes the greed and lust for power of Mussolini and Hitler, who most of the time act like children and not like grown-up adults, fighting with each other for the biggest piece of cake. The ending of the film is, without a doubt, one of the most beautiful I have ever seen. I guess that, at this point, most people know a word or two of the famous speech. It was so heart-felt, human and splendid I couldn't help but cry. The Great Dictator is a film that is not to be missed.

    Chaplin's 'The Great Dictator' is a masterpiece whose only fault is that even Chaplin could not imagine the horrors Adolf Hitler was capable of. It is a very funny film about the darkest horrors of modern history. Chaplin was a comedic genius and 'The Great Dictator' is in my humble opinion, his finest hour. There is no greater creative feat than to take the powerful oppressor and strip him of all his power through art. Chaplin's take on Hitler strips him of all his power. The greater clown was and always will be Adolf Hitler for his reprehensible evil views which Chaplin shows through his humor were incredibly stupid as well. 'The Great Dictator' is very much a film of it's time. Chaplin apparently said that he would not have made it had he known the extent of the atrocities committed by the Nazi. Indeed some of the film has a certain creepiness because we know what we know. I still sort of grimace a bit with the subplot involving the banker Epstein and Hynkel's temporary flirtation with the Jews. The timeless aspect of it though is how it skews the theatricality of such tyrants. Hitler was all show and no substance. What Chaplin does is brutally and often hilariously parody the theatrics behind the Nazi regime. Hitler's greatest power is in how he was able to generate emotion through his grandiose speeches. I've seen the Riefenstahl pictures and to be honest they scare me more than any horror film. Chaplin being the genius he was sees humor in them. It's obvious that Chaplin spent a great deal of time studying his subject as Hitler's mannerisms are copied to the tee and he outdoes himself in parodying them. The impersonation shows how silly the real thing was. I don't think it was ever Chaplin's intention to undermine the dangers of fascism. Adenoid Hynkel is a humorous and inept boob but he is a very real danger and Chaplin generates disgust from his audience as well as laughs. It is a credit to his tremendous skills as an actor and storyteller that he can balance these aspects of the character so well. There's a fiery and aggressive violent streak in Hynkel and he is capable of terrible things and yet we see him for what he really is, a bully who hides his awkwardness and insecurities with his violent fascist views. The Little Tramp is as charming and lovable as ever. I know there is debate as to whether or not the Jewish Barber is the final incantation of Chaplin's tramp and as a Chaplin fan I believe that he absolutely is and that 'The Great Dictator' is Chaplin's 'killing off' the character. The Tramp was always a reflection of the times he lived in and Chaplin did not alter the times to fit comedy. He put his Tramp in situations that showed how ugly the world could be. The Tramp is always a victim of the worst society has to offer it's poor and huddled masses. In 'The Great Dictator' the Tramp has encountered the pinnacle of ugliness man kind is capable of. Chaplin is still as funny as ever but it is shocking to see the Tramp do his slapstick in the streets where 'JEW' is painted on windows or when he plays hot potato with weapons designed to decimate and maim. This could have been a very depressing movie and yet it is heart warming and hopeful because the Tramp always represents faith in the goodness of mankind. Chaplin's speech at the end is a condemnation of fascism to be sure but it is also a eulogy to the tramp and what he stood for. Chaplin absolutely earned the right to such a speech despite it's theatricality because it perfectly sums up the Tramp's entire story. You must have faith in a better tomorrow and most importantly in your self. I think through comedy we have gotten the truest depiction of what Hitler really was. Too many times artists want to portray him as evil incarnate. If Hitler was evil incarnate than the inexcusable Holocaust has an excuse. 'The Great Dictator' and Chaplin's performance bring him out into the open. Hitler was a damn fool

    In Tomania(Germany), dictator Hynkel(Chaplin, doing a fantastic job aping and subverting Hitler's(both he and Mussolini are reduced to spoilt children, screaming when they don't get their way, with their world-altering war decisions being nothing more than them stroking their own egos... an all too true breakdown of many major despots) mannerisms, shouting nonsense speeches and short temper) has a doppelganger in a poor, kind Jewish barber(the contrast he creates between these is compelling) - and the fact that the two look the same, yet are treated so differently is one of numerous clever, and often subtle, comments on the ideology. The writing reveals a thorough understanding of the thinking, reasoning and actions of the Nazis. Sure, there are details that are changed or the like, forgivably to ease the story-telling, to make a point, etc. There are also other types of comedy; mocking and black humor is used to remove the sting from the fear of the shells, army and the mistreatment of the children of Israel. And that last one is treated seriously, as well. The tone will switch very effectively, and suddenly we are afraid of something similar to what we've just been chuckling at. This way, the reality doesn't become lost, and one can sense the actual threat of persecution and foreign invasion right underneath it all. The smart references, including some that, at the time, not everyone would have known enough to get, are mixed in with simpler material. While the slapstick can be rather inspired, the wordplays are on the nose(Italy becomes Bacteria... those don't even sound alike...), and there is the occasional half-baked gag, abandoned as quickly and abruptly as it is begun. This is swiftly paced, and the 120 minute running time tends to go by smoothly(if the narrative jumps awkwardly once or twice). Acting is strong for all concerned, both the broad gesturing and the finer nuances(Goddard is charming, inspiring and memorable as the outspoken Hannah). There is a little violent and disturbing content in this. I recommend this to everyone who appreciates satire dealing with tragedy. 9/10

    Charlie Chaplin's boldest film for its willingness to take on Adolf Hitler before nearly anyone else, "The Great Dictator" was also Chaplin taking on sound 11 years after everyone else. If it had to be the end of cinema's greatest Silent Clown, he did what he could to take down history's greatest monster in the process. There are two reasons to like "The Great Dictator." One is that Chaplin was on the side of the angels, at no small risk given his target's ambitions. The other is he didn't forget to make it funny. Essentially a Prince And The Pauper remake, "Dictator" presents Chaplin as both Adenoid Hynkel, the cruel if inept "Phooey" (a. k. a. "F&uuml;hrer") of Tomainia, and a Jewish World War I veteran, poignantly left unnamed as a nod to the Common Man, who only wants to work in peace at his barber shop. While Hynkel struggles with his two great passions, hating Jews and loving war, the barber finds love and a cause to believe in. The comedy here can be categorized into the great and the good, with most of the former featuring Chaplin as Hynkel. He's simply much funnier here as the bad guy, whether playing it broad (jumping secretaries, delivering speeches in hate-choked gobbledegook) or subtle (after shooting dead a man who claims to have "perfected" a bullet-proof suit, Hynkel simply turns and walks away with a three-word critique: "Far from perfect.") Hynkel is a character who solves Chaplin's legendary problem with sound, whether dressing down his blubbering subordinate Herring (Billy Gilbert) or struggling to keep his composure when fellow dictator Napaloni (Jack Oakie) rebuffs his attempts at intimidation. Told by his right-hand man Garbitsch (Henry Daniell) that the people are objecting to sawdust in the bread, he huffs: "What more do they want? It's from the finest lumber our mills can supply!" The comedy around the barber gets more labored. Maybe it's because much of it turns on the oppression of the Jews, though Chaplin here is trying to establish them as underdogs and rooting interest. It's here the film becomes tricky, not because he is mocking the unmockable but because the characters we meet, including the Barber, are fairly bland and the humor patchy. There is some very funny material here, but excessive bits too where people get klonked with pans or splattered with whitewash. At least Chaplin avoided setting a pie fight in a starving ghetto. The famous last scene is a great divider for many; in it Chaplin steps out of character to address us the audience about...what? The world needs more love and less hate, I guess. It's a philosophically strangled message, both anti-fascist and oddly pacifistic at a time when Hitler's legions were swallowing Europe, with Chaplin warning of "machine men with machine minds" as if he was still making "Modern Times" and punching the sky at times for lame effect. To me it's a crass way to end a good comedy, if perhaps necessary given the stakes involved. Hitler was real, and calling him out for what he was had real value in terms of rallying those called upon to defeat him. If it doesn't transcend time as well as it could, "The Great Dictator" is still a fine comedy that delivers strong laughs and stronger historical resonances.

    Easy to sneer now - but think 1940. Chaplin's three-minute sermon at the end of this film can sound like every brotherly-love clich&eacute; rolled into one, as well as being technically dubious - bolted-on, rather than crafted into the action, and implausible anyway, coming from the lips of a humble barber. But unlike any other, 1940 was a year full of despair for the world, and an appeal for optimism from the Little Tramp, never downhearted for long, must have provided a ray of hope for millions, when it was most needed. "The hate of men will pass." Dare to believe it... Mistaken identity is not exactly the most original storyline either, but Chaplin makes good use of it in his dual role as Hynkel (Hitler) and an unnamed Jewish barber in the ghetto. The action starts in 1918, with the collapse of the Tomanian (German) army, and the barber saving the life of a wounded pilot, but losing his own memory through concussion. Fast-forward twenty years, and the barber escapes from his care-home, to return to the ghetto, now governed by stormtroopers reporting to... none other than the ex-pilot, who is secretly planning a resistance movement. The political background is the Anschluss (invasion of Austria) where Hynkel is competing for influence with an obvious Mussolini figure, played with gusto by Jack Oakie. Owing to some fairly contrived twists, the barber and the pilot find themselves pursued by the law, and happen to arrive at the Austrian border in uniform, just as Hynkel, out duck-shooting in civilian clothes, gets arrested in error. So a huge parade, waiting to be addressed by Hynkel, gets the barber's speech instead, and they all cheer the message of peace. This was only Chaplin's first talkie, and some of its best scenes owe much to silent technique, such as his dance with an inflatable globe, and other sequences that are almost mime with music. Work had started on this film in 1937, and Britain and America were both planning to boycott it, for the sake of their neutrality. It is to Chaplin's credit that he risked his career, as well as his own capital, in pressing ahead with such a vast commitment. But his political naivety always showed, as when someone suggested he should make a similar film about Stalin. "It is hard to play a man who has no faults", came the astonishing reply. Finally, no report on The Great Dictator is complete without some verdict about Hitler's own rumoured screening of it. Two prints were acquired from Portugal and delivered to the F&uuml;hrer's private cinema. Albert Speer declared that Hitler never saw the film - but he couldn't strictly have known. Some say he watched it twice in total silence and made no reaction. Chaplin said he would give anything to know what he thought of it.

    Unforgettable political satire that was tumultuously topical and cannot be realized today with any real assimilation of place and time. It was a brave and biting commentary on the Headlines of the day and prophetically postured what was to be uncovered. A marvelous and unsettling, in retrospect, account of the marching goose-steps of Gestapo tactics and unnatural Nationalism and Fascism. In 1940 this was funny, as it is today, but in just a short time after its release its subject matter could only elicit nervous, under the breath, reluctant half-smiles. It is a graceful and searing poke in the eye at a megalomaniacal Leader of a Sheeple population that was mesmerized by psychological tricks and economic persuasion. A suffering Nation transformed into a War Machine through pomp and circumstance. The Film and its Director held little back as it made an attempt at shedding some light on the absurdities yet to be unveiled. This is a Masterpiece, high Art in its relevance and in hindsight a predetermined cry-out for sanity in what was becoming a completely unhinged and insane World. There are many laughs here as well as intellectual insights and it is all so well produced and perceived that it remains today a testament to Humanity's struggle to stay relatively Human in inhuman situations. There is hardly a false note here and this can be regarded as one of the most poignant views and commentaries on the forces of Evil ever seen through the lens of Motion Picture prognostications and empathetic concerns. One of the best from one of the best...Charlie Chaplin.

    Released on the big screen on October 15, 1940, the film is a satire of Charlie Chaplin at Hitler, in which a Jew is chosen to be the double of the dictator Adenoid Hynkel, who chairs the state Toman. A poor Jewish barber is arrested by the Nazis and taken to the camp with his friend, a former Tomanian soldier arrested for being too friendly with the Jews. More in jest, half seriously, someone once tried to prove that Chaplin made ​​The Great Dictator because Hitler copied his famous mustache. Leaving aside witticism, Chaplin remains among the first timely angry filmmakers, up to an unprecedented pamphleteer explosion in the American film, of all that means fascist constraint in individual lives and the community.

I know there is debate as to whether or not the Jewish Barber is the final incantation of Chaplin's tramp and as a Chaplin fan I believe that he absolutely is and that 'The Great Dictator' is Chaplin's 'killing off' the character. The Tramp was always a reflection of the times he lived in and Chaplin did not alter the times to fit comedy. He put his Tramp in situations that showed how ugly the world could be. The Tramp is always a victim of the worst society has to offer it's poor and huddled masses. In 'The Great Dictator' the Tramp has encountered the pinnacle of ugliness man kind is capable of. Chaplin is still as funny as ever but it is shocking to see the Tramp do his slapstick in the streets where 'JEW' is painted on windows or when he plays hot potato with weapons designed to decimate and maim. This could have been a very depressing movie and yet it is heart warming and hopeful because the Tramp always represents faith in the goodness of mankind. Chaplin's speech at the end is a condemnation of fascism to be sure but it is also a eulogy to the tramp and what he stood for. Chaplin absolutely earned the right to such a speech despite it's theatricality because it perfectly sums up the Tramp's entire story. You must have faith in a better tomorrow and most importantly in your self. I think through comedy we have gotten the truest depiction of what Hitler really was. Too many times artists want to portray him as evil incarnate. If Hitler was evil incarnate than the inexcusable Holocaust has an excuse. 'The Great Dictator' and Chaplin's performance bring him out into the open. Hitler was a damn fool

    In Tomania(Germany), dictator Hynkel(Chaplin, doing a fantastic job aping and subverting Hitler's(both he and Mussolini are reduced to spoilt children, screaming when they don't get their way, with their world-altering war decisions being nothing more than them stroking their own egos... an all too true breakdown of many major despots) mannerisms, shouting nonsense speeches and short temper) has a doppelganger in a poor, kind Jewish barber(the contrast he creates between these is compelling) - and the fact that the two look the same, yet are treated so differently is one of numerous clever, and often subtle, comments on the ideology. The writing reveals a thorough understanding of the thinking, reasoning and actions of the Nazis. Sure, there are details that are changed or the like, forgivably to ease the story-telling, to make a point, etc. There are also other types of comedy; mocking and black humor is used to remove the sting from the fear of the shells, army and the mistreatment of the children of Israel. And that last one is treated seriously, as well. The tone will switch very effectively, and suddenly we are afraid of something similar to what we've just been chuckling at. This way, the reality doesn't become lost, and one can sense the actual threat of persecution and foreign invasion right underneath it all. The smart references, including some that, at the time, not everyone would have known enough to get, are mixed in with simpler material. While the slapstick can be rather inspired, the wordplays are on the nose(Italy becomes Bacteria... those don't even sound alike...), and there is the occasional half-baked gag, abandoned as quickly and abruptly as it is begun. This is swiftly paced, and the 120 minute running time tends to go by smoothly(if the narrative jumps awkwardly once or twice). Acting is strong for all concerned, both the broad gesturing and the finer nuances(Goddard is charming, inspiring and memorable as the outspoken Hannah). There is a little violent and disturbing content in this. I recommend this to everyone who appreciates satire dealing with tragedy. 9/10

    Charlie Chaplin's boldest film for its willingness to take on Adolf Hitler before nearly anyone else, "The Great Dictator" was also Chaplin taking on sound 11 years after everyone else. If it had to be the end of cinema's greatest Silent Clown, he did what he could to take down history's greatest monster in the process. There are two reasons to like "The Great Dictator." One is that Chaplin was on the side of the angels, at no small risk given his target's ambitions. The other is he didn't forget to make it funny. Essentially a Prince And The Pauper remake, "Dictator" presents Chaplin as both Adenoid Hynkel, the cruel if inept "Phooey" (a. k. a. "F&uuml;hrer") of Tomainia, and a Jewish World War I veteran, poignantly left unnamed as a nod to the Common Man, who only wants to work in peace at his barber shop. While Hynkel struggles with his two great passions, hating Jews and loving war, the barber finds love and a cause to believe in. The comedy here can be categorized into the great and the good, with most of the former featuring Chaplin as Hynkel. He's simply much funnier here as the bad guy, whether playing it broad (jumping secretaries, delivering speeches in hate-choked gobbledegook) or subtle (after shooting dead a man who claims to have "perfected" a bullet-proof suit, Hynkel simply turns and walks away with a three-word critique: "Far from perfect.") Hynkel is a character who solves Chaplin's legendary problem with sound, whether dressing down his blubbering subordinate Herring (Billy Gilbert) or struggling to keep his composure when fellow dictator Napaloni (Jack Oakie) rebuffs his attempts at intimidation. Told by his right-hand man Garbitsch (Henry Daniell) that the people are objecting to sawdust in the bread, he huffs: "What more do they want? It's from the finest lumber our mills can supply!" The comedy around the barber gets more labored. Maybe it's because much of it turns on the oppression of the Jews, though Chaplin here is trying to establish them as underdogs and rooting interest. It's here the film becomes tricky, not because he is mocking the unmockable but because the characters we meet, including the Barber, are fairly bland and the humor patchy. There is some very funny material here, but excessive bits too where people get klonked with pans or splattered with whitewash. At least Chaplin avoided setting a pie fight in a starving ghetto. The famous last scene is a great divider for many; in it Chaplin steps out of character to address us the audience about...what? The world needs more love and less hate, I guess. It's a philosophically strangled message, both anti-fascist and oddly pacifistic at a time when Hitler's legions were swallowing Europe, with Chaplin warning of "machine men with machine minds" as if he was still making "Modern Times" and punching the sky at times for lame effect. To me it's a crass way to end a good comedy, if perhaps necessary given the stakes involved. Hitler was real, and calling him out for what he was had real value in terms of rallying those called upon to defeat him. If it doesn't transcend time as well as it could, "The Great Dictator" is still a fine comedy that delivers strong laughs and stronger historical resonances.

    Easy to sneer now - but think 1940. Chaplin's three-minute sermon at the end of this film can sound like every brotherly-love clich&eacute; rolled into one, as well as being technically dubious - bolted-on, rather than crafted into the action, and implausible anyway, coming from the lips of a humble barber. But unlike any other, 1940 was a year full of despair for the world, and an appeal for optimism from the Little Tramp, never downhearted for long, must have provided a ray of hope for millions, when it was most needed. "The hate of men will pass." Dare to believe it... Mistaken identity is not exactly the most original storyline either, but Chaplin makes good use of it in his dual role as Hynkel (Hitler) and an unnamed Jewish barber in the ghetto. The action starts in 1918, with the collapse of the Tomanian (German) army, and the barber saving the life of a wounded pilot, but losing his own memory through concussion. Fast-forward twenty years, and the barber escapes from his care-home, to return to the ghetto, now governed by stormtroopers reporting to... none other than the ex-pilot, who is secretly planning a resistance movement. The political background is the Anschluss (invasion of Austria) where Hynkel is competing for influence with an obvious Mussolini figure, played with gusto by Jack Oakie. Owing to some fairly contrived twists, the barber and the pilot find themselves pursued by the law, and happen to arrive at the Austrian border in uniform, just as Hynkel, out duck-shooting in civilian clothes, gets arrested in error. So a huge parade, waiting to be addressed by Hynkel, gets the barber's speech instead, and they all cheer the message of peace. This was only Chaplin's first talkie, and some of its best scenes owe much to silent technique, such as his dance with an inflatable globe, and other sequences that are almost mime with music. Work had started on this film in 1937, and Britain and America were both planning to boycott it, for the sake of their neutrality. It is to Chaplin's credit that he risked his career, as well as his own capital, in pressing ahead with such a vast commitment. But his political naivety always showed, as when someone suggested he should make a similar film about Stalin. "It is hard to play a man who has no faults", came the astonishing reply. Finally, no report on The Great Dictator is complete without some verdict about Hitler's own rumoured screening of it. Two prints were acquired from Portugal and delivered to the F&uuml;hrer's private cinema. Albert Speer declared that Hitler never saw the film - but he couldn't strictly have known. Some say he watched it twice in total silence and made no reaction. Chaplin said he would give anything to know what he thought of it.

    Unforgettable political satire that was tumultuously topical and cannot be realized today with any real assimilation of place and time. It was a brave and biting commentary on the Headlines of the day and prophetically postured what was to be uncovered. A marvelous and unsettling, in retrospect, account of the marching goose-steps of Gestapo tactics and unnatural Nationalism and Fascism. In 1940 this was funny, as it is today, but in just a short time after its release its subject matter could only elicit nervous, under the breath, reluctant half-smiles. It is a graceful and searing poke in the eye at a megalomaniacal Leader of a Sheeple population that was mesmerized by psychological tricks and economic persuasion. A suffering Nation transformed into a War Machine through pomp and circumstance. The Film and its Director held little back as it made an attempt at shedding some light on the absurdities yet to be unveiled. This is a Masterpiece, high Art in its relevance and in hindsight a predetermined cry-out for sanity in what was becoming a completely unhinged and insane World. There are many laughs here as well as intellectual insights and it is all so well produced and perceived that it remains today a testament to Humanity's struggle to stay relatively Human in inhuman situations. There is hardly a false note here and this can be regarded as one of the most poignant views and commentaries on the forces of Evil ever seen through the lens of Motion Picture prognostications and empathetic concerns. One of the best from one of the best...Charlie Chaplin.

    Released on the big screen on October 15, 1940, the film is a satire of Charlie Chaplin at Hitler, in which a Jew is chosen to be the double of the dictator Adenoid Hynkel, who chairs the state Toman. A poor Jewish barber is arrested by the Nazis and taken to the camp with his friend, a former Tomanian soldier arrested for being too friendly with the Jews. More in jest, half seriously, someone once tried to prove that Chaplin made ​​The Great Dictator because Hitler copied his famous mustache. Leaving aside witticism, Chaplin remains among the first timely angry filmmakers, up to an unprecedented pamphleteer explosion in the American film, of all that means fascist constraint in individual lives and the community.

    One of the most controversial films of its time, The Great Dictator is Charlie Chaplin's satirical take on Adolf Hitler and his ideals. This is Charlie Chaplin's first talkie and doesn't portray Chaplin making a joke out of everything since the moments of laughter in this film are nicely blended with stark drama and makes a bold statement in the final moments that resonates all race, borders & boundaries and with its universal message connects with everyone. Highly entertaining, brilliantly structured & superbly performed, immensely enjoyable and presenting Chaplin in the role of both a Jew and a dictator, thus giving him more dimensions to explore, The Great Dictator is one of the many comedy classics that has only grown in stature with passing time. The last 5 minutes of this film alone creates far more impact than many other films trying to deliver the same message with their 2-hour plus runtime and Chaplin truly nailed that scene with his now prominent speech that wraps this film up. Overall, a daring, important & remarkable work from, arguably, the greatest cinematic personality to have ever lived.

    "Chaplin's masterpiece?" Henry asked. "Uh. Modern Times is a good movie too. There are also others. Like The tramp and I belief...eh" "City Lights?" "That one." "The Kid?" "Oh.. I guess." "Figured an commie like you would name Modern Times." Henry smiled. "Eh?" "You mentioned Modern Times. A commie would like it. The movie is just an attack on capitalism." "Uhm. Commie? Well.. let's talk about that in due time." "On with Hitler.. eh The Great Dictator." Henry said. "I bet he couldn't laugh about it, but I wonder.. would Mussolini have laughed about it?" "I bet not. I bet that people who are dictators can't laugh about themselves, if they could they wouldn't be dictators." Henry said. "Wow.. that is an observation of life." " I can observe life as well as anyone else can." "I bet." "So a masterpiece?" "Yes and no." "Yes and no?" "Well it's a masterpiece in the way it is made and what it is about and the statement Chaplin makes. That makes it an unique movie." "But it is also a long slapstick movie, which has it's moments at times, like when Hinkel and Napaloni meet, but still feels like a bit old fashioned even in the 1940. Like those chase scenes when the Schulz troopers are after him." "Schulz." Kristl laughed. "What?" "It is a funny name as it means guilt in German. It is an apt name because Schulz saves the Jewish barber because he owes him for saving his life, but later on he feel guilt because he has supported Hynkel. I wonder if Chaplin was deliberate in that." "Might be." Henry said, "I found most of the story somewhat dull and sometimes strange. Like when nobody sees the similarity between Hynkel and the Jewish barber. Also it has a nice feel about it. Like those Nazi were not nice people, but the it is probably meant as a slapstick. So it had to be nice." Kristl nodded, "The story has it's odd twist and turns. Like that Hynkel and the Jewish barber switch roles. It is as if he mixed two kind of movies. A serious movie and a slapstick movie." "It might be.. I found it a bit long in the tooth." Henry yawned. "Still it remains a masterpiece." "Ah" "It is a tribute to the belief that we are all humans, each and everyone of us, and that we could live in peace. The end speech is often felt as an awkward long statement.. but it is here that you feel Chaplin shoving aside the movie and directly addresses the viewer. It was of course not done and it must have felt embarrassing by many to be directly talked to. As a method of movie making it was seldom seen in a normal movie. It clearly brought out the idea that you can invoke a strong emotion by directly talking into the camera and the audience." "And that makes it a masterpiece?" "That and his direct appeal to humanity."

    The Great Dictator is a break nick comedy that satirizes Hitler like no other film maker in history has ever dared or will ever dare. Of course Charlie Chaplin would have never made the movie, if he knew how things were going to turn out. The movie has some of the funniest scenes i have ever seen but it also finds itself in Drama, specially the last speech. This last speech, which many believe to be the weakness of the movie, is the most important of them all. He was asked by executives to cut the part out but he was determined to keep it since he knew the seriousness of the matter. Chaplin said he would have given anything to know how Hitler felt about it. I too would have given anything to know too but i also read, from IMDb FAQ, that Hitler saw it twice. It must have interested him in some level.......

    The Great Dictator is a funny, charming and witty film, with excellent performances, especially from Charlie Chaplin and his wife, Paulette Goddard. But it's not all about comedy; behind the laughters lies a critique of the war and how pointless, damaging and inhuman it is. It shows the situation of the Jewish people, who were often abused and ridiculized by the German army. It satirizes the greed and lust for power of Mussolini and Hitler, who most of the time act like children and not like grown-up adults, fighting with each other for the biggest piece of cake. The ending of the film is, without a doubt, one of the most beautiful I have ever seen. I guess that, at this point, most people know a word or two of the famous speech. It was so heart-felt, human and splendid I couldn't help but cry. The Great Dictator is a film that is not to be missed.

    Chaplin's 'The Great Dictator' is a masterpiece whose only fault is that even Chaplin could not imagine the horrors Adolf Hitler was capable of. It is a very funny film about the darkest horrors of modern history. Chaplin was a comedic genius and 'The Great Dictator' is in my humble opinion, his finest hour. There is no greater creative feat than to take the powerful oppressor and strip him of all his power through art. Chaplin's take on Hitler strips him of all his power. The greater clown was and always will be Adolf Hitler for his reprehensible evil views which Chaplin shows through his humor were incredibly stupid as well. 'The Great Dictator' is very much a film of it's time. Chaplin apparently said that he would not have made it had he known the extent of the atrocities committed by the Nazi. Indeed some of the film has a certain creepiness because we know what we know. I still sort of grimace a bit with the subplot involving the banker Epstein and Hynkel's temporary flirtation with the Jews. The timeless aspect of it though is how it skews the theatricality of such tyrants. Hitler was all show and no substance. What Chaplin does is brutally and often hilariously parody the theatrics behind the Nazi regime. Hitler's greatest power is in how he was able to generate emotion through his grandiose speeches. I've seen the Riefenstahl pictures and to be honest they scare me more than any horror film. Chaplin being the genius he was sees humor in them. It's obvious that Chaplin spent a great deal of time studying his subject as Hitler's mannerisms are copied to the tee and he outdoes himself in parodying them. The impersonation shows how silly the real thing was. I don't think it was ever Chaplin's intention to undermine the dangers of fascism. Adenoid Hynkel is a humorous and inept boob but he is a very real danger and Chaplin generates disgust from his audience as well as laughs. It is a credit to his tremendous skills as an actor and storyteller that he can balance these aspects of the character so well. There's a fiery and aggressive violent streak in Hynkel and he is capable of terrible things and yet we see him for what he really is, a bully who hides his awkwardness and insecurities with his violent fascist views. The Little Tramp is as charming and lovable as ever. I know there is debate as to whether or not the Jewish Barber is the final incantation of Chaplin's tramp and as a Chaplin fan I believe that he absolutely is and that 'The Great Dictator' is Chaplin's 'killing off' the character. The Tramp was always a reflection of the times he lived in and Chaplin did not alter the times to fit comedy. He put his Tramp in situations that showed how ugly the world could be. The Tramp is always a victim of the worst society has to offer it's poor and huddled masses. In 'The Great Dictator' the Tramp has encountered the pinnacle of ugliness man kind is capable of. Chaplin is still as funny as ever but it is shocking to see the Tramp do his slapstick in the streets where 'JEW' is painted on windows or when he plays hot potato with weapons designed to decimate and maim. This could have been a very depressing movie and yet it is heart warming and hopeful because the Tramp always represents faith in the goodness of mankind. Chaplin's speech at the end is a condemnation of fascism to be sure but it is also a eulogy to the tramp and what he stood for. Chaplin absolutely earned the right to such a speech despite it's theatricality because it perfectly sums up the Tramp's entire story. You must have faith in a better tomorrow and most importantly in your self. I think through comedy we have gotten the truest depiction of what Hitler really was. Too many times artists want to portray him as evil incarnate. If Hitler was evil incarnate than the inexcusable Holocaust has an excuse. 'The Great Dictator' and Chaplin's performance bring him out into the open. Hitler was a damn fool

But his political naivety always showed, as when someone suggested he should make a similar film about Stalin. "It is hard to play a man who has no faults", came the astonishing reply. Finally, no report on The Great Dictator is complete without some verdict about Hitler's own rumoured screening of it. Two prints were acquired from Portugal and delivered to the F&uuml;hrer's private cinema. Albert Speer declared that Hitler never saw the film - but he couldn't strictly have known. Some say he watched it twice in total silence and made no reaction. Chaplin said he would give anything to know what he thought of it.

    Unforgettable political satire that was tumultuously topical and cannot be realized today with any real assimilation of place and time. It was a brave and biting commentary on the Headlines of the day and prophetically postured what was to be uncovered. A marvelous and unsettling, in retrospect, account of the marching goose-steps of Gestapo tactics and unnatural Nationalism and Fascism. In 1940 this was funny, as it is today, but in just a short time after its release its subject matter could only elicit nervous, under the breath, reluctant half-smiles. It is a graceful and searing poke in the eye at a megalomaniacal Leader of a Sheeple population that was mesmerized by psychological tricks and economic persuasion. A suffering Nation transformed into a War Machine through pomp and circumstance. The Film and its Director held little back as it made an attempt at shedding some light on the absurdities yet to be unveiled. This is a Masterpiece, high Art in its relevance and in hindsight a predetermined cry-out for sanity in what was becoming a completely unhinged and insane World. There are many laughs here as well as intellectual insights and it is all so well produced and perceived that it remains today a testament to Humanity's struggle to stay relatively Human in inhuman situations. There is hardly a false note here and this can be regarded as one of the most poignant views and commentaries on the forces of Evil ever seen through the lens of Motion Picture prognostications and empathetic concerns. One of the best from one of the best...Charlie Chaplin.
