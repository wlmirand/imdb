 <sinopse>
  Two friends who are dissatisfied with their jobs decide to join the army for a bit of fun.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Thanks to a run of bad luck and go-nowhere jobs, John convinces Russell to join the army so they can get in shape, likening it to a health spa. Once in boot camp, wiseguy John tangles with his by-the-book Sgt. and becomes the unofficial leader for his platoon, made up mostly of other misfits and assorted losers. After somehow making it through graduation, they are given a special assignment but, thanks to John's romantic interest in a pretty MPO, the other men wind up behind the Iron Curtain until John, Russell, their dates and Sgt. Hulka make a daring rescue attempt in explosive style.

    Director Ivan Reitman brings the gang together for a bit of fun. John (Bill Murray) just got fired from driving a cab. Russell (Harold Ramis) is tired of teaching English to immigrants. They decide to join the army. There they meet Ox (John Candy). Sgt. Hulka (Warren Oates) is there to shape them up. And they're led by the sleazy incompetent Capt. Stillman (John Larroquette). The fact that John and Russell keep getting into trouble means they keep meeting MPs Stella (PJ Soles) and Louise (Sean Young). Bill Murray is his sarcastic self. Harold Ramis is a competent sidekick. But the best fun was had by John Candy who mud wrestled with a whole of beauties. Although not the group's best collaboration, this is still very funny especially if you like Bill Murray's antics.

    Bill Murray and Harold Ramis play two friends who find themselves jobless, broke, and out-of-shape, so impulsively join the army, only to find out that their lark has "serious" consequences for their lives. Marginal comedy is really bolstered by Warren Oates' turn as tough Drill instructor Sgt. Hulka, who isn't remotely going to put up with their immature buffoonery. John Candy also shines as an overweight but game recruit in their platoon, who is ready for anything. Undeniably funny at times, but goes wrong when the platoon takes on a serious rescue mission behind the Iron Curtain,; the tone of this is all wrong, not to mention absurd. Still, this was a big hit, but older viewers may find themselves preferring an old-fashioned military comedy that Abbott & Costello have starred in!

    Ivan Reitman's 'Stripes' is among the funniest military comedies to come from Hollywood. This is also the movie that established Bill Murray, Harold Ramis, John Laroquette and John Candy as comedy actors (and introduced many like Judge Reinhold and John Diehl). Since then, Reitman has reunite with Ramis and Murray to create films like 'Ghostbusters' (which was a smash hit). The key ingredient that makes 'Stripes' work so hilariously is Ramis and Goldberg's script. Reitman, his producers and writers originally wanted to make another Cheech and Chong film but things didn't turn out as expected and they left it to Ramis and Goldberg to readjust the script for actors Bill Murray and Harold Ramis. Now the writers just knew the actors very well so it was easy to rewrite for them and there was plenty of space for improvisation which added to the spontaneity of the humour. The entire cast shared great chemistry and work excellently off each other. Murray and Ramis give some memorable scenes and who could forget their conflicts with Warren Oates's 'Hulka'? And John Candy's unforgettable mud-wrestling scene? One can easily tell that they had a great time filming (which the cast and crew admit to in later interviews). It's been a while since I last saw a film that had me laughing constantly. The first half of the film focuses on the training scenes and the second half on their 'mission' to protect a military R.V. which leads to a little 'battle' in what was then known as Czechoslovakia. Throughout the characters remain consistent, never out of place and I liked that there wasn't too much focus on the final battle scene, leaving the humour balanced. To conclude, this is one of the most ticklish films I've seen. Even memories of it have me laughing. An awesome film to enjoy with friends.

    I had a really fun time watching this clever Bill Murray film. It did not win awards, but this film is not meant to. It is just a fun film that pokes fun at the Army and where you can laugh until your side hurts too much. This is about John Winger who decides to join the military because he feels like he has nothing more to do with his current lifestyle. He drags his friend to join the military and they plan to show the military what it is like to have a good time. When this film was released in 1981, the cast was unknown with the exception of Bill Murray. Murray is really funny in this movie and this would be film that led him and Harold Ramis to be together in Ghostbusters. The whole cast was just great especially the late Warren Oates as the drill sergeant. Overall, this film met my expectations. I was expecting to have a fun time with his film and I did. I rate this film 8/10.

    Ivan Reitman is the Mel Brooks of his generation, which means he takes nothing seriously, and this film is the perfect example. Bill Murray is his typical "everyman", just a plain Joe who is in his late 20's who has no clue what to do with his life. Harold Ramis is his buddy, and the two of them together make enlisting in the Army akin to signing up for Little League. The movie is resplendent with little side jokes and plots. John Candy and his ersatz side kick, played by John Diehl, are constantly doing the Stanly and Ollie routine. John Larroquette plays the typical college graduate who joined the Army to lead men and blow stuff up, and has no clue whatsoever how to do either (Don't laugh too hard, I actually worked with junior Ensigns in the Navy with the same problem). Warren Oats is the only truly straight up character in the entire film, and his attitude is very similar to Bobby Troup's in M*A*S*H (G&* D#$% Army). But you have to love this film, simply because it does what no other film can do, makes a very dangerous and serious profession and turns it into a reflection on the human condition. The film is rated "R" for slight nudity, language, and inferences to drug use, but I think most teenagers can watch this without being corrupted. Definitely a must for any collector of cinema.

    i remember seeing this as a kid when it came out.. and only thing i liked then was when the platoon did the amazing song and dance at graduation which in itself was very impressive, and of course the cute mp's that kept bailing them out of trouble.... but watching it again 20 yrs later there's a ton of good stuff that i missed and can appreciate this comedy ever more .... fully recommended for anyone having a lousy day ... put your feet up grab your snack foods and enjoy one of the best comedies ever made... with an all star cast.. those then they were just emerging. definitely a classic army comedy. solid flick with few cheesy moments even they are likable.

    I am on record as saying Bill Murray is a comedy God. He ruled the 80s (Caddyshack, Stripes, Ghostbusters, Scrooged) stole the 90s (Groundhog Day, What About Bob? Rushmore), and remained relevant in the dubbos by interspersing more serious roles (Lost in Translation, Broken Flowers) in between the funny stuff. Though it must be said that the funny stuff is getting harder to find, Garfield 1 AND 2? In reality a minor cameo in Zombieland was the decade's best effort  I'm not a fan of either Tenenbaums or Steve Zissou. Over the last weekend one of the more retro channels had a mini marathon of classic 80s movies, so over the course of a weekend I sat down and watched Colors, Angel Heart, Enemy Mine and Stripes. Stripes follows the classic strategy of putting funny guys in unexpected situations and letting them act accordingly  Will Ferrell has made a career out of it (whether I think it a worthy career is another matter)  in this case John (Murray) and Russell (Harold Ramis) are down on their luck average joes who decide to enlist in the army to make a few bucks After all what could go wrong? Right? This lends itself to various scenarios that show John, Russell and a cavalcade of disparate characters (including John Candy and Judge Reinhold) as they bumble and fluff their way through basic training under the watchful and vigilant eye of one Sergeant Hulka (Warren Oates). Now as much as I love Murray and this film wouldn't exist without him, Sgt Hulka is what sets Stripes apart. His dogged determination and blunt dealings with his trainees creates a great juxtaposition with John's carefree and anti-rules position, and the two are often at odds with each other over anything remotely pertaining to discipline. Being an 80s comedy there is an inept Captain in charge who has no idea how the army really works, some quasi-hot female MPs who are there to provide John and Russell with something to have sex with, and a variety of non-standard situations to create laughs  a mud wrestling challenge with nubile young women anyone? So after the troop half arses their way through basic training a "could only happen in the movies" event sees them all not only pass but get given the plumb job of guarding the army's new super secret weapon  which looks like a medium sized bus with some cheap metal riveted onto the side panels. Will they get up to mischief and inadvertently set the US on the brink of international conflict? You'll have to watch and find out. Murray shines in his deadpan, dry, I couldn't possibly be more sarcastic  no, wait, yes I can way, Ramis is solid as the straight man reacting to his new surroundings in quite a reasonable way, and Hulka is always there to yell just loud enough and to create enough friction to stir things up and keep the plot moving. As good as the soldiers are, Hulka drives them and the movie to greater heights. His role is truly one of the defining supporting roles of comedy in the 80s. Final Rating  7 / 10. Stripes is funny, lighthearted, painless and likable in every way. It also has just enough gratuitous 80s nudity to top everything off

    I understand the enjoyment of it. The prolonged and arguably dignified ancestry includes Buck Privates, Duck Soup and the like. This cheeky young Bill Murray is firmly anchored in Groucho, the clue I'd consider an early scuffle with a Manhattan matron. The idea is recapturing the same timbre but with a clear post-SNL hipster slacker derision. And like those vintage vehicles were for the classic comedy teams, storytelling amounts to little more than piecing together various sorts of obligatory scenes, cycling through the kinds that entails. You look back on all the moments and not so much the transitions between them. Who needs them? That's supposed to be the attitude one brings to one of these sorts of movies. It has that Animal House feel. Take a rigid institution of authoritarian discipline and formality and throw a big pie in its face. And fart on its head for good measure. Just as John Vernon was the anal-retentive square lording it over our slacker heroes in John Landis' film, Warren Oates plays Sgt. 1st Class Hulka, who gives Murray the most discipline he must've ever had in his life, making him the closest character in the film to give the film cohesion. Otherwise, this lazy but likable classic wastes most of its time overstressing situations contradicted from the start by Murray's character. The star act and his material are essentially misaligned until the tedious, scattered script ultimately labors past basic training. The blessing I think Stripes brings to the golden-age slapstick template is a more vivid ensemble. Yes, In the Navy and A Night at the Opera had plots, but with the attention to detail and ripeness in dialogue and characterization of a present-day cartoon. The peripheral people around the stars of the act were virtually prevented from having too much presence or distinction for fear of upstaging the deal-breaking stars, but in Stripes, others clowning in basic-training include Judge Reinhold's head-bobbing stoner, Conrad Dunn's broad-stroke acknowledgment to Travis Bickle (likely more of a Harold Ramis contribution), and John Candy's soft-hearted fatso, who finds the Laurel to his Hardy in southern boy John Diehl. They all have the kind of indelible character we hope for in especially young performances of actors who later became more prevalent. And yet P.J. Soles and Sean Young are there for one reason, the same one reason all us young guys wanted them in it. Other than that, there is absolutely nothing else. Not a single realistic action is allowed from them. Director Ivan Reitman is a sure merchant. He knows that the cheap laughs are the most certain, that we like to see bunglers get it together without losing their ungainly style, and that it doesn't harm business to slot in a sorority shower scene or nude mud-wrestling competition every 30 minutes or so. Vietnam was by now a bygone phase, and this is Reagan's Good Army. When Ivan Reitman wants to ambush the Eastern Bloc in a Winnebago crammed with rockets, he has the certified OK for dozens of tanks, explosions, shootouts and hand-to-hand combat moments. But believe me, it was a great deal funnier when we were ten.

    After a terrible day when the taxi driver John Winger (Bill Murray) loses his job, his car and finally is dumped by his girlfriend Anita (Roberta Leighton), he convinces his best friend Russell (Harold Ramis) to join the army to travel and have fun. They team-up with a platoon of outcast and misfits, and John has problems with their tough Sergeant Hulka (Warren Oates). John and Russell get into successive troubles, but they are always rescued by the Military Police Officers Stella (P.J. Soles) and Louise (Sean Young). Near the graduation, the clumsy and imbecile Captain Stillman (John Larroquette) provokes an accident and Sergeant Hulka is wounded; however, John uses his leadership and the general is impressed with the platoon and assigns the group to go to Italy with the prototype of an armored car. John and Russell are responsible to take care of the prototype, but they date Stella and Louise. Meanwhile Captain Stillman believes that they have stolen the vehicle and crosses the Iron Curtain with Hulka's platoon and they are captured by the communist. Sergeant Hulka escapes and releases a distress signal and John, Russell, Stella and Louise decide to help to rescue their friends from Czechoslovakia. "Stripes" is a silly and funny comedy, but what else could I expect from a cast with the names of Bill Murray, John Candy, John Larroquette and the other comedians. The extended cut is long and most of the jokes are "politically incorrect" or sexists, but also hilarious. This is the first time that I see this 1981 comedy on DVD and I laughed a lot. My vote is six. Title (Brazil): "Recrutas da Pesada" ("Rough Recruiters")

Murray shines in his deadpan, dry, I couldn't possibly be more sarcastic  no, wait, yes I can way, Ramis is solid as the straight man reacting to his new surroundings in quite a reasonable way, and Hulka is always there to yell just loud enough and to create enough friction to stir things up and keep the plot moving. As good as the soldiers are, Hulka drives them and the movie to greater heights. His role is truly one of the defining supporting roles of comedy in the 80s. Final Rating  7 / 10. Stripes is funny, lighthearted, painless and likable in every way. It also has just enough gratuitous 80s nudity to top everything off

    I understand the enjoyment of it. The prolonged and arguably dignified ancestry includes Buck Privates, Duck Soup and the like. This cheeky young Bill Murray is firmly anchored in Groucho, the clue I'd consider an early scuffle with a Manhattan matron. The idea is recapturing the same timbre but with a clear post-SNL hipster slacker derision. And like those vintage vehicles were for the classic comedy teams, storytelling amounts to little more than piecing together various sorts of obligatory scenes, cycling through the kinds that entails. You look back on all the moments and not so much the transitions between them. Who needs them? That's supposed to be the attitude one brings to one of these sorts of movies. It has that Animal House feel. Take a rigid institution of authoritarian discipline and formality and throw a big pie in its face. And fart on its head for good measure. Just as John Vernon was the anal-retentive square lording it over our slacker heroes in John Landis' film, Warren Oates plays Sgt. 1st Class Hulka, who gives Murray the most discipline he must've ever had in his life, making him the closest character in the film to give the film cohesion. Otherwise, this lazy but likable classic wastes most of its time overstressing situations contradicted from the start by Murray's character. The star act and his material are essentially misaligned until the tedious, scattered script ultimately labors past basic training. The blessing I think Stripes brings to the golden-age slapstick template is a more vivid ensemble. Yes, In the Navy and A Night at the Opera had plots, but with the attention to detail and ripeness in dialogue and characterization of a present-day cartoon. The peripheral people around the stars of the act were virtually prevented from having too much presence or distinction for fear of upstaging the deal-breaking stars, but in Stripes, others clowning in basic-training include Judge Reinhold's head-bobbing stoner, Conrad Dunn's broad-stroke acknowledgment to Travis Bickle (likely more of a Harold Ramis contribution), and John Candy's soft-hearted fatso, who finds the Laurel to his Hardy in southern boy John Diehl. They all have the kind of indelible character we hope for in especially young performances of actors who later became more prevalent. And yet P.J. Soles and Sean Young are there for one reason, the same one reason all us young guys wanted them in it. Other than that, there is absolutely nothing else. Not a single realistic action is allowed from them. Director Ivan Reitman is a sure merchant. He knows that the cheap laughs are the most certain, that we like to see bunglers get it together without losing their ungainly style, and that it doesn't harm business to slot in a sorority shower scene or nude mud-wrestling competition every 30 minutes or so. Vietnam was by now a bygone phase, and this is Reagan's Good Army. When Ivan Reitman wants to ambush the Eastern Bloc in a Winnebago crammed with rockets, he has the certified OK for dozens of tanks, explosions, shootouts and hand-to-hand combat moments. But believe me, it was a great deal funnier when we were ten.

    After a terrible day when the taxi driver John Winger (Bill Murray) loses his job, his car and finally is dumped by his girlfriend Anita (Roberta Leighton), he convinces his best friend Russell (Harold Ramis) to join the army to travel and have fun. They team-up with a platoon of outcast and misfits, and John has problems with their tough Sergeant Hulka (Warren Oates). John and Russell get into successive troubles, but they are always rescued by the Military Police Officers Stella (P.J. Soles) and Louise (Sean Young). Near the graduation, the clumsy and imbecile Captain Stillman (John Larroquette) provokes an accident and Sergeant Hulka is wounded; however, John uses his leadership and the general is impressed with the platoon and assigns the group to go to Italy with the prototype of an armored car. John and Russell are responsible to take care of the prototype, but they date Stella and Louise. Meanwhile Captain Stillman believes that they have stolen the vehicle and crosses the Iron Curtain with Hulka's platoon and they are captured by the communist. Sergeant Hulka escapes and releases a distress signal and John, Russell, Stella and Louise decide to help to rescue their friends from Czechoslovakia. "Stripes" is a silly and funny comedy, but what else could I expect from a cast with the names of Bill Murray, John Candy, John Larroquette and the other comedians. The extended cut is long and most of the jokes are "politically incorrect" or sexists, but also hilarious. This is the first time that I see this 1981 comedy on DVD and I laughed a lot. My vote is six. Title (Brazil): "Recrutas da Pesada" ("Rough Recruiters")

    Director Ivan Reitman brings the gang together for a bit of fun. John (Bill Murray) just got fired from driving a cab. Russell (Harold Ramis) is tired of teaching English to immigrants. They decide to join the army. There they meet Ox (John Candy). Sgt. Hulka (Warren Oates) is there to shape them up. And they're led by the sleazy incompetent Capt. Stillman (John Larroquette). The fact that John and Russell keep getting into trouble means they keep meeting MPs Stella (PJ Soles) and Louise (Sean Young). Bill Murray is his sarcastic self. Harold Ramis is a competent sidekick. But the best fun was had by John Candy who mud wrestled with a whole of beauties. Although not the group's best collaboration, this is still very funny especially if you like Bill Murray's antics.

    Bill Murray and Harold Ramis play two friends who find themselves jobless, broke, and out-of-shape, so impulsively join the army, only to find out that their lark has "serious" consequences for their lives. Marginal comedy is really bolstered by Warren Oates' turn as tough Drill instructor Sgt. Hulka, who isn't remotely going to put up with their immature buffoonery. John Candy also shines as an overweight but game recruit in their platoon, who is ready for anything. Undeniably funny at times, but goes wrong when the platoon takes on a serious rescue mission behind the Iron Curtain,; the tone of this is all wrong, not to mention absurd. Still, this was a big hit, but older viewers may find themselves preferring an old-fashioned military comedy that Abbott & Costello have starred in!

    Ivan Reitman's 'Stripes' is among the funniest military comedies to come from Hollywood. This is also the movie that established Bill Murray, Harold Ramis, John Laroquette and John Candy as comedy actors (and introduced many like Judge Reinhold and John Diehl). Since then, Reitman has reunite with Ramis and Murray to create films like 'Ghostbusters' (which was a smash hit). The key ingredient that makes 'Stripes' work so hilariously is Ramis and Goldberg's script. Reitman, his producers and writers originally wanted to make another Cheech and Chong film but things didn't turn out as expected and they left it to Ramis and Goldberg to readjust the script for actors Bill Murray and Harold Ramis. Now the writers just knew the actors very well so it was easy to rewrite for them and there was plenty of space for improvisation which added to the spontaneity of the humour. The entire cast shared great chemistry and work excellently off each other. Murray and Ramis give some memorable scenes and who could forget their conflicts with Warren Oates's 'Hulka'? And John Candy's unforgettable mud-wrestling scene? One can easily tell that they had a great time filming (which the cast and crew admit to in later interviews). It's been a while since I last saw a film that had me laughing constantly. The first half of the film focuses on the training scenes and the second half on their 'mission' to protect a military R.V. which leads to a little 'battle' in what was then known as Czechoslovakia. Throughout the characters remain consistent, never out of place and I liked that there wasn't too much focus on the final battle scene, leaving the humour balanced. To conclude, this is one of the most ticklish films I've seen. Even memories of it have me laughing. An awesome film to enjoy with friends.

    I had a really fun time watching this clever Bill Murray film. It did not win awards, but this film is not meant to. It is just a fun film that pokes fun at the Army and where you can laugh until your side hurts too much. This is about John Winger who decides to join the military because he feels like he has nothing more to do with his current lifestyle. He drags his friend to join the military and they plan to show the military what it is like to have a good time. When this film was released in 1981, the cast was unknown with the exception of Bill Murray. Murray is really funny in this movie and this would be film that led him and Harold Ramis to be together in Ghostbusters. The whole cast was just great especially the late Warren Oates as the drill sergeant. Overall, this film met my expectations. I was expecting to have a fun time with his film and I did. I rate this film 8/10.

    Ivan Reitman is the Mel Brooks of his generation, which means he takes nothing seriously, and this film is the perfect example. Bill Murray is his typical "everyman", just a plain Joe who is in his late 20's who has no clue what to do with his life. Harold Ramis is his buddy, and the two of them together make enlisting in the Army akin to signing up for Little League. The movie is resplendent with little side jokes and plots. John Candy and his ersatz side kick, played by John Diehl, are constantly doing the Stanly and Ollie routine. John Larroquette plays the typical college graduate who joined the Army to lead men and blow stuff up, and has no clue whatsoever how to do either (Don't laugh too hard, I actually worked with junior Ensigns in the Navy with the same problem). Warren Oats is the only truly straight up character in the entire film, and his attitude is very similar to Bobby Troup's in M*A*S*H (G&* D#$% Army). But you have to love this film, simply because it does what no other film can do, makes a very dangerous and serious profession and turns it into a reflection on the human condition. The film is rated "R" for slight nudity, language, and inferences to drug use, but I think most teenagers can watch this without being corrupted. Definitely a must for any collector of cinema.

    i remember seeing this as a kid when it came out.. and only thing i liked then was when the platoon did the amazing song and dance at graduation which in itself was very impressive, and of course the cute mp's that kept bailing them out of trouble.... but watching it again 20 yrs later there's a ton of good stuff that i missed and can appreciate this comedy ever more .... fully recommended for anyone having a lousy day ... put your feet up grab your snack foods and enjoy one of the best comedies ever made... with an all star cast.. those then they were just emerging. definitely a classic army comedy. solid flick with few cheesy moments even they are likable.

    I am on record as saying Bill Murray is a comedy God. He ruled the 80s (Caddyshack, Stripes, Ghostbusters, Scrooged) stole the 90s (Groundhog Day, What About Bob? Rushmore), and remained relevant in the dubbos by interspersing more serious roles (Lost in Translation, Broken Flowers) in between the funny stuff. Though it must be said that the funny stuff is getting harder to find, Garfield 1 AND 2? In reality a minor cameo in Zombieland was the decade's best effort  I'm not a fan of either Tenenbaums or Steve Zissou. Over the last weekend one of the more retro channels had a mini marathon of classic 80s movies, so over the course of a weekend I sat down and watched Colors, Angel Heart, Enemy Mine and Stripes. Stripes follows the classic strategy of putting funny guys in unexpected situations and letting them act accordingly  Will Ferrell has made a career out of it (whether I think it a worthy career is another matter)  in this case John (Murray) and Russell (Harold Ramis) are down on their luck average joes who decide to enlist in the army to make a few bucks After all what could go wrong? Right? This lends itself to various scenarios that show John, Russell and a cavalcade of disparate characters (including John Candy and Judge Reinhold) as they bumble and fluff their way through basic training under the watchful and vigilant eye of one Sergeant Hulka (Warren Oates). Now as much as I love Murray and this film wouldn't exist without him, Sgt Hulka is what sets Stripes apart. His dogged determination and blunt dealings with his trainees creates a great juxtaposition with John's carefree and anti-rules position, and the two are often at odds with each other over anything remotely pertaining to discipline. Being an 80s comedy there is an inept Captain in charge who has no idea how the army really works, some quasi-hot female MPs who are there to provide John and Russell with something to have sex with, and a variety of non-standard situations to create laughs  a mud wrestling challenge with nubile young women anyone? So after the troop half arses their way through basic training a "could only happen in the movies" event sees them all not only pass but get given the plumb job of guarding the army's new super secret weapon  which looks like a medium sized bus with some cheap metal riveted onto the side panels. Will they get up to mischief and inadvertently set the US on the brink of international conflict? You'll have to watch and find out. Murray shines in his deadpan, dry, I couldn't possibly be more sarcastic  no, wait, yes I can way, Ramis is solid as the straight man reacting to his new surroundings in quite a reasonable way, and Hulka is always there to yell just loud enough and to create enough friction to stir things up and keep the plot moving. As good as the soldiers are, Hulka drives them and the movie to greater heights. His role is truly one of the defining supporting roles of comedy in the 80s. Final Rating  7 / 10. Stripes is funny, lighthearted, painless and likable in every way. It also has just enough gratuitous 80s nudity to top everything off

    I understand the enjoyment of it. The prolonged and arguably dignified ancestry includes Buck Privates, Duck Soup and the like. This cheeky young Bill Murray is firmly anchored in Groucho, the clue I'd consider an early scuffle with a Manhattan matron. The idea is recapturing the same timbre but with a clear post-SNL hipster slacker derision. And like those vintage vehicles were for the classic comedy teams, storytelling amounts to little more than piecing together various sorts of obligatory scenes, cycling through the kinds that entails.

When Ivan Reitman wants to ambush the Eastern Bloc in a Winnebago crammed with rockets, he has the certified OK for dozens of tanks, explosions, shootouts and hand-to-hand combat moments. But believe me, it was a great deal funnier when we were ten.

    i remember seeing this as a kid when it came out.. and only thing i liked then was when the platoon did the amazing song and dance at graduation which in itself was very impressive, and of course the cute mp's that kept bailing them out of trouble.... but watching it again 20 yrs later there's a ton of good stuff that i missed and can appreciate this comedy ever more .... fully recommended for anyone having a lousy day ... put your feet up grab your snack foods and enjoy one of the best comedies ever made... with an all star cast.. those then they were just emerging. definitely a classic army comedy. solid flick with few cheesy moments even they are likable.

    I am on record as saying Bill Murray is a comedy God. He ruled the 80s (Caddyshack, Stripes, Ghostbusters, Scrooged) stole the 90s (Groundhog Day, What About Bob? Rushmore), and remained relevant in the dubbos by interspersing more serious roles (Lost in Translation, Broken Flowers) in between the funny stuff. Though it must be said that the funny stuff is getting harder to find, Garfield 1 AND 2? In reality a minor cameo in Zombieland was the decade's best effort  I'm not a fan of either Tenenbaums or Steve Zissou. Over the last weekend one of the more retro channels had a mini marathon of classic 80s movies, so over the course of a weekend I sat down and watched Colors, Angel Heart, Enemy Mine and Stripes. Stripes follows the classic strategy of putting funny guys in unexpected situations and letting them act accordingly  Will Ferrell has made a career out of it (whether I think it a worthy career is another matter)  in this case John (Murray) and Russell (Harold Ramis) are down on their luck average joes who decide to enlist in the army to make a few bucks After all what could go wrong? Right? This lends itself to various scenarios that show John, Russell and a cavalcade of disparate characters (including John Candy and Judge Reinhold) as they bumble and fluff their way through basic training under the watchful and vigilant eye of one Sergeant Hulka (Warren Oates). Now as much as I love Murray and this film wouldn't exist without him, Sgt Hulka is what sets Stripes apart. His dogged determination and blunt dealings with his trainees creates a great juxtaposition with John's carefree and anti-rules position, and the two are often at odds with each other over anything remotely pertaining to discipline. Being an 80s comedy there is an inept Captain in charge who has no idea how the army really works, some quasi-hot female MPs who are there to provide John and Russell with something to have sex with, and a variety of non-standard situations to create laughs  a mud wrestling challenge with nubile young women anyone? So after the troop half arses their way through basic training a "could only happen in the movies" event sees them all not only pass but get given the plumb job of guarding the army's new super secret weapon  which looks like a medium sized bus with some cheap metal riveted onto the side panels. Will they get up to mischief and inadvertently set the US on the brink of international conflict? You'll have to watch and find out. Murray shines in his deadpan, dry, I couldn't possibly be more sarcastic  no, wait, yes I can way, Ramis is solid as the straight man reacting to his new surroundings in quite a reasonable way, and Hulka is always there to yell just loud enough and to create enough friction to stir things up and keep the plot moving. As good as the soldiers are, Hulka drives them and the movie to greater heights. His role is truly one of the defining supporting roles of comedy in the 80s. Final Rating  7 / 10. Stripes is funny, lighthearted, painless and likable in every way. It also has just enough gratuitous 80s nudity to top everything off

    I understand the enjoyment of it. The prolonged and arguably dignified ancestry includes Buck Privates, Duck Soup and the like. This cheeky young Bill Murray is firmly anchored in Groucho, the clue I'd consider an early scuffle with a Manhattan matron. The idea is recapturing the same timbre but with a clear post-SNL hipster slacker derision. And like those vintage vehicles were for the classic comedy teams, storytelling amounts to little more than piecing together various sorts of obligatory scenes, cycling through the kinds that entails. You look back on all the moments and not so much the transitions between them. Who needs them? That's supposed to be the attitude one brings to one of these sorts of movies. It has that Animal House feel. Take a rigid institution of authoritarian discipline and formality and throw a big pie in its face. And fart on its head for good measure. Just as John Vernon was the anal-retentive square lording it over our slacker heroes in John Landis' film, Warren Oates plays Sgt. 1st Class Hulka, who gives Murray the most discipline he must've ever had in his life, making him the closest character in the film to give the film cohesion. Otherwise, this lazy but likable classic wastes most of its time overstressing situations contradicted from the start by Murray's character. The star act and his material are essentially misaligned until the tedious, scattered script ultimately labors past basic training. The blessing I think Stripes brings to the golden-age slapstick template is a more vivid ensemble. Yes, In the Navy and A Night at the Opera had plots, but with the attention to detail and ripeness in dialogue and characterization of a present-day cartoon. The peripheral people around the stars of the act were virtually prevented from having too much presence or distinction for fear of upstaging the deal-breaking stars, but in Stripes, others clowning in basic-training include Judge Reinhold's head-bobbing stoner, Conrad Dunn's broad-stroke acknowledgment to Travis Bickle (likely more of a Harold Ramis contribution), and John Candy's soft-hearted fatso, who finds the Laurel to his Hardy in southern boy John Diehl. They all have the kind of indelible character we hope for in especially young performances of actors who later became more prevalent. And yet P.J. Soles and Sean Young are there for one reason, the same one reason all us young guys wanted them in it. Other than that, there is absolutely nothing else. Not a single realistic action is allowed from them. Director Ivan Reitman is a sure merchant. He knows that the cheap laughs are the most certain, that we like to see bunglers get it together without losing their ungainly style, and that it doesn't harm business to slot in a sorority shower scene or nude mud-wrestling competition every 30 minutes or so. Vietnam was by now a bygone phase, and this is Reagan's Good Army. When Ivan Reitman wants to ambush the Eastern Bloc in a Winnebago crammed with rockets, he has the certified OK for dozens of tanks, explosions, shootouts and hand-to-hand combat moments. But believe me, it was a great deal funnier when we were ten.

    After a terrible day when the taxi driver John Winger (Bill Murray) loses his job, his car and finally is dumped by his girlfriend Anita (Roberta Leighton), he convinces his best friend Russell (Harold Ramis) to join the army to travel and have fun. They team-up with a platoon of outcast and misfits, and John has problems with their tough Sergeant Hulka (Warren Oates). John and Russell get into successive troubles, but they are always rescued by the Military Police Officers Stella (P.J. Soles) and Louise (Sean Young). Near the graduation, the clumsy and imbecile Captain Stillman (John Larroquette) provokes an accident and Sergeant Hulka is wounded; however, John uses his leadership and the general is impressed with the platoon and assigns the group to go to Italy with the prototype of an armored car. John and Russell are responsible to take care of the prototype, but they date Stella and Louise. Meanwhile Captain Stillman believes that they have stolen the vehicle and crosses the Iron Curtain with Hulka's platoon and they are captured by the communist. Sergeant Hulka escapes and releases a distress signal and John, Russell, Stella and Louise decide to help to rescue their friends from Czechoslovakia. "Stripes" is a silly and funny comedy, but what else could I expect from a cast with the names of Bill Murray, John Candy, John Larroquette and the other comedians. The extended cut is long and most of the jokes are "politically incorrect" or sexists, but also hilarious. This is the first time that I see this 1981 comedy on DVD and I laughed a lot. My vote is six. Title (Brazil): "Recrutas da Pesada" ("Rough Recruiters")

    Director Ivan Reitman brings the gang together for a bit of fun. John (Bill Murray) just got fired from driving a cab. Russell (Harold Ramis) is tired of teaching English to immigrants. They decide to join the army. There they meet Ox (John Candy). Sgt. Hulka (Warren Oates) is there to shape them up. And they're led by the sleazy incompetent Capt. Stillman (John Larroquette). The fact that John and Russell keep getting into trouble means they keep meeting MPs Stella (PJ Soles) and Louise (Sean Young). Bill Murray is his sarcastic self. Harold Ramis is a competent sidekick. But the best fun was had by John Candy who mud wrestled with a whole of beauties. Although not the group's best collaboration, this is still very funny especially if you like Bill Murray's antics.

    Bill Murray and Harold Ramis play two friends who find themselves jobless, broke, and out-of-shape, so impulsively join the army, only to find out that their lark has "serious" consequences for their lives. Marginal comedy is really bolstered by Warren Oates' turn as tough Drill instructor Sgt. Hulka, who isn't remotely going to put up with their immature buffoonery. John Candy also shines as an overweight but game recruit in their platoon, who is ready for anything. Undeniably funny at times, but goes wrong when the platoon takes on a serious rescue mission behind the Iron Curtain,; the tone of this is all wrong, not to mention absurd. Still, this was a big hit, but older viewers may find themselves preferring an old-fashioned military comedy that Abbott & Costello have starred in!

    Ivan Reitman's 'Stripes' is among the funniest military comedies to come from Hollywood. This is also the movie that established Bill Murray, Harold Ramis, John Laroquette and John Candy as comedy actors (and introduced many like Judge Reinhold and John Diehl). Since then, Reitman has reunite with Ramis and Murray to create films like 'Ghostbusters' (which was a smash hit). The key ingredient that makes 'Stripes' work so hilariously is Ramis and Goldberg's script. Reitman, his producers and writers originally wanted to make another Cheech and Chong film but things didn't turn out as expected and they left it to Ramis and Goldberg to readjust the script for actors Bill Murray and Harold Ramis. Now the writers just knew the actors very well so it was easy to rewrite for them and there was plenty of space for improvisation which added to the spontaneity of the humour. The entire cast shared great chemistry and work excellently off each other. Murray and Ramis give some memorable scenes and who could forget their conflicts with Warren Oates's 'Hulka'? And John Candy's unforgettable mud-wrestling scene? One can easily tell that they had a great time filming (which the cast and crew admit to in later interviews). It's been a while since I last saw a film that had me laughing constantly. The first half of the film focuses on the training scenes and the second half on their 'mission' to protect a military R.V. which leads to a little 'battle' in what was then known as Czechoslovakia. Throughout the characters remain consistent, never out of place and I liked that there wasn't too much focus on the final battle scene, leaving the humour balanced. To conclude, this is one of the most ticklish films I've seen. Even memories of it have me laughing. An awesome film to enjoy with friends.

    I had a really fun time watching this clever Bill Murray film. It did not win awards, but this film is not meant to. It is just a fun film that pokes fun at the Army and where you can laugh until your side hurts too much. This is about John Winger who decides to join the military because he feels like he has nothing more to do with his current lifestyle. He drags his friend to join the military and they plan to show the military what it is like to have a good time. When this film was released in 1981, the cast was unknown with the exception of Bill Murray. Murray is really funny in this movie and this would be film that led him and Harold Ramis to be together in Ghostbusters. The whole cast was just great especially the late Warren Oates as the drill sergeant. Overall, this film met my expectations. I was expecting to have a fun time with his film and I did. I rate this film 8/10.

    Ivan Reitman is the Mel Brooks of his generation, which means he takes nothing seriously, and this film is the perfect example. Bill Murray is his typical "everyman", just a plain Joe who is in his late 20's who has no clue what to do with his life. Harold Ramis is his buddy, and the two of them together make enlisting in the Army akin to signing up for Little League. The movie is resplendent with little side jokes and plots. John Candy and his ersatz side kick, played by John Diehl, are constantly doing the Stanly and Ollie routine. John Larroquette plays the typical college graduate who joined the Army to lead men and blow stuff up, and has no clue whatsoever how to do either (Don't laugh too hard, I actually worked with junior Ensigns in the Navy with the same problem). Warren Oats is the only truly straight up character in the entire film, and his attitude is very similar to Bobby Troup's in M*A*S*H (G&* D#$% Army). But you have to love this film, simply because it does what no other film can do, makes a very dangerous and serious profession and turns it into a reflection on the human condition. The film is rated "R" for slight nudity, language, and inferences to drug use, but I think most teenagers can watch this without being corrupted. Definitely a must for any collector of cinema.

The entire cast shared great chemistry and work excellently off each other. Murray and Ramis give some memorable scenes and who could forget their conflicts with Warren Oates's 'Hulka'? And John Candy's unforgettable mud-wrestling scene? One can easily tell that they had a great time filming (which the cast and crew admit to in later interviews). It's been a while since I last saw a film that had me laughing constantly. The first half of the film focuses on the training scenes and the second half on their 'mission' to protect a military R.V. which leads to a little 'battle' in what was then known as Czechoslovakia. Throughout the characters remain consistent, never out of place and I liked that there wasn't too much focus on the final battle scene, leaving the humour balanced. To conclude, this is one of the most ticklish films I've seen. Even memories of it have me laughing. An awesome film to enjoy with friends.

    I had a really fun time watching this clever Bill Murray film. It did not win awards, but this film is not meant to. It is just a fun film that pokes fun at the Army and where you can laugh until your side hurts too much. This is about John Winger who decides to join the military because he feels like he has nothing more to do with his current lifestyle. He drags his friend to join the military and they plan to show the military what it is like to have a good time. When this film was released in 1981, the cast was unknown with the exception of Bill Murray. Murray is really funny in this movie and this would be film that led him and Harold Ramis to be together in Ghostbusters. The whole cast was just great especially the late Warren Oates as the drill sergeant. Overall, this film met my expectations. I was expecting to have a fun time with his film and I did. I rate this film 8/10.

    Ivan Reitman is the Mel Brooks of his generation, which means he takes nothing seriously, and this film is the perfect example. Bill Murray is his typical "everyman", just a plain Joe who is in his late 20's who has no clue what to do with his life. Harold Ramis is his buddy, and the two of them together make enlisting in the Army akin to signing up for Little League. The movie is resplendent with little side jokes and plots. John Candy and his ersatz side kick, played by John Diehl, are constantly doing the Stanly and Ollie routine. John Larroquette plays the typical college graduate who joined the Army to lead men and blow stuff up, and has no clue whatsoever how to do either (Don't laugh too hard, I actually worked with junior Ensigns in the Navy with the same problem). Warren Oats is the only truly straight up character in the entire film, and his attitude is very similar to Bobby Troup's in M*A*S*H (G&* D#$% Army). But you have to love this film, simply because it does what no other film can do, makes a very dangerous and serious profession and turns it into a reflection on the human condition. The film is rated "R" for slight nudity, language, and inferences to drug use, but I think most teenagers can watch this without being corrupted. Definitely a must for any collector of cinema.

    i remember seeing this as a kid when it came out.. and only thing i liked then was when the platoon did the amazing song and dance at graduation which in itself was very impressive, and of course the cute mp's that kept bailing them out of trouble.... but watching it again 20 yrs later there's a ton of good stuff that i missed and can appreciate this comedy ever more .... fully recommended for anyone having a lousy day ... put your feet up grab your snack foods and enjoy one of the best comedies ever made... with an all star cast.. those then they were just emerging. definitely a classic army comedy. solid flick with few cheesy moments even they are likable.

    I am on record as saying Bill Murray is a comedy God. He ruled the 80s (Caddyshack, Stripes, Ghostbusters, Scrooged) stole the 90s (Groundhog Day, What About Bob? Rushmore), and remained relevant in the dubbos by interspersing more serious roles (Lost in Translation, Broken Flowers) in between the funny stuff. Though it must be said that the funny stuff is getting harder to find, Garfield 1 AND 2? In reality a minor cameo in Zombieland was the decade's best effort  I'm not a fan of either Tenenbaums or Steve Zissou. Over the last weekend one of the more retro channels had a mini marathon of classic 80s movies, so over the course of a weekend I sat down and watched Colors, Angel Heart, Enemy Mine and Stripes. Stripes follows the classic strategy of putting funny guys in unexpected situations and letting them act accordingly  Will Ferrell has made a career out of it (whether I think it a worthy career is another matter)  in this case John (Murray) and Russell (Harold Ramis) are down on their luck average joes who decide to enlist in the army to make a few bucks After all what could go wrong? Right? This lends itself to various scenarios that show John, Russell and a cavalcade of disparate characters (including John Candy and Judge Reinhold) as they bumble and fluff their way through basic training under the watchful and vigilant eye of one Sergeant Hulka (Warren Oates). Now as much as I love Murray and this film wouldn't exist without him, Sgt Hulka is what sets Stripes apart. His dogged determination and blunt dealings with his trainees creates a great juxtaposition with John's carefree and anti-rules position, and the two are often at odds with each other over anything remotely pertaining to discipline. Being an 80s comedy there is an inept Captain in charge who has no idea how the army really works, some quasi-hot female MPs who are there to provide John and Russell with something to have sex with, and a variety of non-standard situations to create laughs  a mud wrestling challenge with nubile young women anyone? So after the troop half arses their way through basic training a "could only happen in the movies" event sees them all not only pass but get given the plumb job of guarding the army's new super secret weapon  which looks like a medium sized bus with some cheap metal riveted onto the side panels. Will they get up to mischief and inadvertently set the US on the brink of international conflict? You'll have to watch and find out. Murray shines in his deadpan, dry, I couldn't possibly be more sarcastic  no, wait, yes I can way, Ramis is solid as the straight man reacting to his new surroundings in quite a reasonable way, and Hulka is always there to yell just loud enough and to create enough friction to stir things up and keep the plot moving. As good as the soldiers are, Hulka drives them and the movie to greater heights. His role is truly one of the defining supporting roles of comedy in the 80s. Final Rating  7 / 10. Stripes is funny, lighthearted, painless and likable in every way. It also has just enough gratuitous 80s nudity to top everything off

    I understand the enjoyment of it. The prolonged and arguably dignified ancestry includes Buck Privates, Duck Soup and the like. This cheeky young Bill Murray is firmly anchored in Groucho, the clue I'd consider an early scuffle with a Manhattan matron. The idea is recapturing the same timbre but with a clear post-SNL hipster slacker derision. And like those vintage vehicles were for the classic comedy teams, storytelling amounts to little more than piecing together various sorts of obligatory scenes, cycling through the kinds that entails. You look back on all the moments and not so much the transitions between them. Who needs them? That's supposed to be the attitude one brings to one of these sorts of movies. It has that Animal House feel. Take a rigid institution of authoritarian discipline and formality and throw a big pie in its face. And fart on its head for good measure. Just as John Vernon was the anal-retentive square lording it over our slacker heroes in John Landis' film, Warren Oates plays Sgt. 1st Class Hulka, who gives Murray the most discipline he must've ever had in his life, making him the closest character in the film to give the film cohesion. Otherwise, this lazy but likable classic wastes most of its time overstressing situations contradicted from the start by Murray's character. The star act and his material are essentially misaligned until the tedious, scattered script ultimately labors past basic training. The blessing I think Stripes brings to the golden-age slapstick template is a more vivid ensemble. Yes, In the Navy and A Night at the Opera had plots, but with the attention to detail and ripeness in dialogue and characterization of a present-day cartoon. The peripheral people around the stars of the act were virtually prevented from having too much presence or distinction for fear of upstaging the deal-breaking stars, but in Stripes, others clowning in basic-training include Judge Reinhold's head-bobbing stoner, Conrad Dunn's broad-stroke acknowledgment to Travis Bickle (likely more of a Harold Ramis contribution), and John Candy's soft-hearted fatso, who finds the Laurel to his Hardy in southern boy John Diehl. They all have the kind of indelible character we hope for in especially young performances of actors who later became more prevalent. And yet P.J. Soles and Sean Young are there for one reason, the same one reason all us young guys wanted them in it. Other than that, there is absolutely nothing else. Not a single realistic action is allowed from them. Director Ivan Reitman is a sure merchant. He knows that the cheap laughs are the most certain, that we like to see bunglers get it together without losing their ungainly style, and that it doesn't harm business to slot in a sorority shower scene or nude mud-wrestling competition every 30 minutes or so. Vietnam was by now a bygone phase, and this is Reagan's Good Army. When Ivan Reitman wants to ambush the Eastern Bloc in a Winnebago crammed with rockets, he has the certified OK for dozens of tanks, explosions, shootouts and hand-to-hand combat moments. But believe me, it was a great deal funnier when we were ten.

    After a terrible day when the taxi driver John Winger (Bill Murray) loses his job, his car and finally is dumped by his girlfriend Anita (Roberta Leighton), he convinces his best friend Russell (Harold Ramis) to join the army to travel and have fun. They team-up with a platoon of outcast and misfits, and John has problems with their tough Sergeant Hulka (Warren Oates). John and Russell get into successive troubles, but they are always rescued by the Military Police Officers Stella (P.J. Soles) and Louise (Sean Young). Near the graduation, the clumsy and imbecile Captain Stillman (John Larroquette) provokes an accident and Sergeant Hulka is wounded; however, John uses his leadership and the general is impressed with the platoon and assigns the group to go to Italy with the prototype of an armored car. John and Russell are responsible to take care of the prototype, but they date Stella and Louise. Meanwhile Captain Stillman believes that they have stolen the vehicle and crosses the Iron Curtain with Hulka's platoon and they are captured by the communist. Sergeant Hulka escapes and releases a distress signal and John, Russell, Stella and Louise decide to help to rescue their friends from Czechoslovakia. "Stripes" is a silly and funny comedy, but what else could I expect from a cast with the names of Bill Murray, John Candy, John Larroquette and the other comedians. The extended cut is long and most of the jokes are "politically incorrect" or sexists, but also hilarious. This is the first time that I see this 1981 comedy on DVD and I laughed a lot. My vote is six. Title (Brazil): "Recrutas da Pesada" ("Rough Recruiters")

    Director Ivan Reitman brings the gang together for a bit of fun. John (Bill Murray) just got fired from driving a cab. Russell (Harold Ramis) is tired of teaching English to immigrants. They decide to join the army. There they meet Ox (John Candy). Sgt. Hulka (Warren Oates) is there to shape them up. And they're led by the sleazy incompetent Capt. Stillman (John Larroquette). The fact that John and Russell keep getting into trouble means they keep meeting MPs Stella (PJ Soles) and Louise (Sean Young). Bill Murray is his sarcastic self. Harold Ramis is a competent sidekick. But the best fun was had by John Candy who mud wrestled with a whole of beauties. Although not the group's best collaboration, this is still very funny especially if you like Bill Murray's antics.

    Bill Murray and Harold Ramis play two friends who find themselves jobless, broke, and out-of-shape, so impulsively join the army, only to find out that their lark has "serious" consequences for their lives. Marginal comedy is really bolstered by Warren Oates' turn as tough Drill instructor Sgt. Hulka, who isn't remotely going to put up with their immature buffoonery. John Candy also shines as an overweight but game recruit in their platoon, who is ready for anything. Undeniably funny at times, but goes wrong when the platoon takes on a serious rescue mission behind the Iron Curtain,; the tone of this is all wrong, not to mention absurd. Still, this was a big hit, but older viewers may find themselves preferring an old-fashioned military comedy that Abbott & Costello have starred in!

    Ivan Reitman's 'Stripes' is among the funniest military comedies to come from Hollywood. This is also the movie that established Bill Murray, Harold Ramis, John Laroquette and John Candy as comedy actors (and introduced many like Judge Reinhold and John Diehl). Since then, Reitman has reunite with Ramis and Murray to create films like 'Ghostbusters' (which was a smash hit). The key ingredient that makes 'Stripes' work so hilariously is Ramis and Goldberg's script. Reitman, his producers and writers originally wanted to make another Cheech and Chong film but things didn't turn out as expected and they left it to Ramis and Goldberg to readjust the script for actors Bill Murray and Harold Ramis. Now the writers just knew the actors very well so it was easy to rewrite for them and there was plenty of space for improvisation which added to the spontaneity of the humour. The entire cast shared great chemistry and work excellently off each other. Murray and Ramis give some memorable scenes and who could forget their conflicts with Warren Oates's 'Hulka'? And John Candy's unforgettable mud-wrestling scene? One can easily tell that they had a great time filming (which the cast and crew admit to in later interviews). It's been a while since I last saw a film that had me laughing constantly. The first half of the film focuses on the training scenes and the second half on their 'mission' to protect a military R.V. which leads to a little 'battle' in what was then known as Czechoslovakia. Throughout the characters remain consistent, never out of place and I liked that there wasn't too much focus on the final battle scene, leaving the humour balanced. To conclude, this is one of the most ticklish films I've seen. Even memories of it have me laughing. An awesome film to enjoy with friends.

The fact that John and Russell keep getting into trouble means they keep meeting MPs Stella (PJ Soles) and Louise (Sean Young). Bill Murray is his sarcastic self. Harold Ramis is a competent sidekick. But the best fun was had by John Candy who mud wrestled with a whole of beauties. Although not the group's best collaboration, this is still very funny especially if you like Bill Murray's antics.

    Bill Murray and Harold Ramis play two friends who find themselves jobless, broke, and out-of-shape, so impulsively join the army, only to find out that their lark has "serious" consequences for their lives. Marginal comedy is really bolstered by Warren Oates' turn as tough Drill instructor Sgt. Hulka, who isn't remotely going to put up with their immature buffoonery. John Candy also shines as an overweight but game recruit in their platoon, who is ready for anything. Undeniably funny at times, but goes wrong when the platoon takes on a serious rescue mission behind the Iron Curtain,; the tone of this is all wrong, not to mention absurd. Still, this was a big hit, but older viewers may find themselves preferring an old-fashioned military comedy that Abbott & Costello have starred in!

    Ivan Reitman's 'Stripes' is among the funniest military comedies to come from Hollywood. This is also the movie that established Bill Murray, Harold Ramis, John Laroquette and John Candy as comedy actors (and introduced many like Judge Reinhold and John Diehl). Since then, Reitman has reunite with Ramis and Murray to create films like 'Ghostbusters' (which was a smash hit). The key ingredient that makes 'Stripes' work so hilariously is Ramis and Goldberg's script. Reitman, his producers and writers originally wanted to make another Cheech and Chong film but things didn't turn out as expected and they left it to Ramis and Goldberg to readjust the script for actors Bill Murray and Harold Ramis. Now the writers just knew the actors very well so it was easy to rewrite for them and there was plenty of space for improvisation which added to the spontaneity of the humour. The entire cast shared great chemistry and work excellently off each other. Murray and Ramis give some memorable scenes and who could forget their conflicts with Warren Oates's 'Hulka'? And John Candy's unforgettable mud-wrestling scene? One can easily tell that they had a great time filming (which the cast and crew admit to in later interviews). It's been a while since I last saw a film that had me laughing constantly. The first half of the film focuses on the training scenes and the second half on their 'mission' to protect a military R.V. which leads to a little 'battle' in what was then known as Czechoslovakia. Throughout the characters remain consistent, never out of place and I liked that there wasn't too much focus on the final battle scene, leaving the humour balanced. To conclude, this is one of the most ticklish films I've seen. Even memories of it have me laughing. An awesome film to enjoy with friends.

    I had a really fun time watching this clever Bill Murray film. It did not win awards, but this film is not meant to. It is just a fun film that pokes fun at the Army and where you can laugh until your side hurts too much. This is about John Winger who decides to join the military because he feels like he has nothing more to do with his current lifestyle. He drags his friend to join the military and they plan to show the military what it is like to have a good time. When this film was released in 1981, the cast was unknown with the exception of Bill Murray. Murray is really funny in this movie and this would be film that led him and Harold Ramis to be together in Ghostbusters. The whole cast was just great especially the late Warren Oates as the drill sergeant. Overall, this film met my expectations. I was expecting to have a fun time with his film and I did. I rate this film 8/10.

    Ivan Reitman is the Mel Brooks of his generation, which means he takes nothing seriously, and this film is the perfect example. Bill Murray is his typical "everyman", just a plain Joe who is in his late 20's who has no clue what to do with his life. Harold Ramis is his buddy, and the two of them together make enlisting in the Army akin to signing up for Little League. The movie is resplendent with little side jokes and plots. John Candy and his ersatz side kick, played by John Diehl, are constantly doing the Stanly and Ollie routine. John Larroquette plays the typical college graduate who joined the Army to lead men and blow stuff up, and has no clue whatsoever how to do either (Don't laugh too hard, I actually worked with junior Ensigns in the Navy with the same problem). Warren Oats is the only truly straight up character in the entire film, and his attitude is very similar to Bobby Troup's in M*A*S*H (G&* D#$% Army). But you have to love this film, simply because it does what no other film can do, makes a very dangerous and serious profession and turns it into a reflection on the human condition. The film is rated "R" for slight nudity, language, and inferences to drug use, but I think most teenagers can watch this without being corrupted. Definitely a must for any collector of cinema.

    i remember seeing this as a kid when it came out.. and only thing i liked then was when the platoon did the amazing song and dance at graduation which in itself was very impressive, and of course the cute mp's that kept bailing them out of trouble.... but watching it again 20 yrs later there's a ton of good stuff that i missed and can appreciate this comedy ever more .... fully recommended for anyone having a lousy day ... put your feet up grab your snack foods and enjoy one of the best comedies ever made... with an all star cast.. those then they were just emerging. definitely a classic army comedy. solid flick with few cheesy moments even they are likable.

    I am on record as saying Bill Murray is a comedy God. He ruled the 80s (Caddyshack, Stripes, Ghostbusters, Scrooged) stole the 90s (Groundhog Day, What About Bob? Rushmore), and remained relevant in the dubbos by interspersing more serious roles (Lost in Translation, Broken Flowers) in between the funny stuff. Though it must be said that the funny stuff is getting harder to find, Garfield 1 AND 2? In reality a minor cameo in Zombieland was the decade's best effort  I'm not a fan of either Tenenbaums or Steve Zissou. Over the last weekend one of the more retro channels had a mini marathon of classic 80s movies, so over the course of a weekend I sat down and watched Colors, Angel Heart, Enemy Mine and Stripes. Stripes follows the classic strategy of putting funny guys in unexpected situations and letting them act accordingly  Will Ferrell has made a career out of it (whether I think it a worthy career is another matter)  in this case John (Murray) and Russell (Harold Ramis) are down on their luck average joes who decide to enlist in the army to make a few bucks After all what could go wrong? Right? This lends itself to various scenarios that show John, Russell and a cavalcade of disparate characters (including John Candy and Judge Reinhold) as they bumble and fluff their way through basic training under the watchful and vigilant eye of one Sergeant Hulka (Warren Oates). Now as much as I love Murray and this film wouldn't exist without him, Sgt Hulka is what sets Stripes apart. His dogged determination and blunt dealings with his trainees creates a great juxtaposition with John's carefree and anti-rules position, and the two are often at odds with each other over anything remotely pertaining to discipline. Being an 80s comedy there is an inept Captain in charge who has no idea how the army really works, some quasi-hot female MPs who are there to provide John and Russell with something to have sex with, and a variety of non-standard situations to create laughs  a mud wrestling challenge with nubile young women anyone? So after the troop half arses their way through basic training a "could only happen in the movies" event sees them all not only pass but get given the plumb job of guarding the army's new super secret weapon  which looks like a medium sized bus with some cheap metal riveted onto the side panels. Will they get up to mischief and inadvertently set the US on the brink of international conflict? You'll have to watch and find out. Murray shines in his deadpan, dry, I couldn't possibly be more sarcastic  no, wait, yes I can way, Ramis is solid as the straight man reacting to his new surroundings in quite a reasonable way, and Hulka is always there to yell just loud enough and to create enough friction to stir things up and keep the plot moving. As good as the soldiers are, Hulka drives them and the movie to greater heights. His role is truly one of the defining supporting roles of comedy in the 80s. Final Rating  7 / 10. Stripes is funny, lighthearted, painless and likable in every way. It also has just enough gratuitous 80s nudity to top everything off

    I understand the enjoyment of it. The prolonged and arguably dignified ancestry includes Buck Privates, Duck Soup and the like. This cheeky young Bill Murray is firmly anchored in Groucho, the clue I'd consider an early scuffle with a Manhattan matron. The idea is recapturing the same timbre but with a clear post-SNL hipster slacker derision. And like those vintage vehicles were for the classic comedy teams, storytelling amounts to little more than piecing together various sorts of obligatory scenes, cycling through the kinds that entails. You look back on all the moments and not so much the transitions between them. Who needs them? That's supposed to be the attitude one brings to one of these sorts of movies. It has that Animal House feel. Take a rigid institution of authoritarian discipline and formality and throw a big pie in its face. And fart on its head for good measure. Just as John Vernon was the anal-retentive square lording it over our slacker heroes in John Landis' film, Warren Oates plays Sgt. 1st Class Hulka, who gives Murray the most discipline he must've ever had in his life, making him the closest character in the film to give the film cohesion. Otherwise, this lazy but likable classic wastes most of its time overstressing situations contradicted from the start by Murray's character. The star act and his material are essentially misaligned until the tedious, scattered script ultimately labors past basic training. The blessing I think Stripes brings to the golden-age slapstick template is a more vivid ensemble. Yes, In the Navy and A Night at the Opera had plots, but with the attention to detail and ripeness in dialogue and characterization of a present-day cartoon. The peripheral people around the stars of the act were virtually prevented from having too much presence or distinction for fear of upstaging the deal-breaking stars, but in Stripes, others clowning in basic-training include Judge Reinhold's head-bobbing stoner, Conrad Dunn's broad-stroke acknowledgment to Travis Bickle (likely more of a Harold Ramis contribution), and John Candy's soft-hearted fatso, who finds the Laurel to his Hardy in southern boy John Diehl. They all have the kind of indelible character we hope for in especially young performances of actors who later became more prevalent. And yet P.J. Soles and Sean Young are there for one reason, the same one reason all us young guys wanted them in it. Other than that, there is absolutely nothing else. Not a single realistic action is allowed from them. Director Ivan Reitman is a sure merchant. He knows that the cheap laughs are the most certain, that we like to see bunglers get it together without losing their ungainly style, and that it doesn't harm business to slot in a sorority shower scene or nude mud-wrestling competition every 30 minutes or so. Vietnam was by now a bygone phase, and this is Reagan's Good Army. When Ivan Reitman wants to ambush the Eastern Bloc in a Winnebago crammed with rockets, he has the certified OK for dozens of tanks, explosions, shootouts and hand-to-hand combat moments. But believe me, it was a great deal funnier when we were ten.

    After a terrible day when the taxi driver John Winger (Bill Murray) loses his job, his car and finally is dumped by his girlfriend Anita (Roberta Leighton), he convinces his best friend Russell (Harold Ramis) to join the army to travel and have fun. They team-up with a platoon of outcast and misfits, and John has problems with their tough Sergeant Hulka (Warren Oates). John and Russell get into successive troubles, but they are always rescued by the Military Police Officers Stella (P.J. Soles) and Louise (Sean Young). Near the graduation, the clumsy and imbecile Captain Stillman (John Larroquette) provokes an accident and Sergeant Hulka is wounded; however, John uses his leadership and the general is impressed with the platoon and assigns the group to go to Italy with the prototype of an armored car. John and Russell are responsible to take care of the prototype, but they date Stella and Louise. Meanwhile Captain Stillman believes that they have stolen the vehicle and crosses the Iron Curtain with Hulka's platoon and they are captured by the communist. Sergeant Hulka escapes and releases a distress signal and John, Russell, Stella and Louise decide to help to rescue their friends from Czechoslovakia. "Stripes" is a silly and funny comedy, but what else could I expect from a cast with the names of Bill Murray, John Candy, John Larroquette and the other comedians. The extended cut is long and most of the jokes are "politically incorrect" or sexists, but also hilarious. This is the first time that I see this 1981 comedy on DVD and I laughed a lot. My vote is six. Title (Brazil): "Recrutas da Pesada" ("Rough Recruiters")

The peripheral people around the stars of the act were virtually prevented from having too much presence or distinction for fear of upstaging the deal-breaking stars, but in Stripes, others clowning in basic-training include Judge Reinhold's head-bobbing stoner, Conrad Dunn's broad-stroke acknowledgment to Travis Bickle (likely more of a Harold Ramis contribution), and John Candy's soft-hearted fatso, who finds the Laurel to his Hardy in southern boy John Diehl. They all have the kind of indelible character we hope for in especially young performances of actors who later became more prevalent. And yet P.J. Soles and Sean Young are there for one reason, the same one reason all us young guys wanted them in it. Other than that, there is absolutely nothing else. Not a single realistic action is allowed from them. Director Ivan Reitman is a sure merchant. He knows that the cheap laughs are the most certain, that we like to see bunglers get it together without losing their ungainly style, and that it doesn't harm business to slot in a sorority shower scene or nude mud-wrestling competition every 30 minutes or so. Vietnam was by now a bygone phase, and this is Reagan's Good Army. When Ivan Reitman wants to ambush the Eastern Bloc in a Winnebago crammed with rockets, he has the certified OK for dozens of tanks, explosions, shootouts and hand-to-hand combat moments. But believe me, it was a great deal funnier when we were ten.

    After a terrible day when the taxi driver John Winger (Bill Murray) loses his job, his car and finally is dumped by his girlfriend Anita (Roberta Leighton), he convinces his best friend Russell (Harold Ramis) to join the army to travel and have fun. They team-up with a platoon of outcast and misfits, and John has problems with their tough Sergeant Hulka (Warren Oates). John and Russell get into successive troubles, but they are always rescued by the Military Police Officers Stella (P.J. Soles) and Louise (Sean Young). Near the graduation, the clumsy and imbecile Captain Stillman (John Larroquette) provokes an accident and Sergeant Hulka is wounded; however, John uses his leadership and the general is impressed with the platoon and assigns the group to go to Italy with the prototype of an armored car. John and Russell are responsible to take care of the prototype, but they date Stella and Louise. Meanwhile Captain Stillman believes that they have stolen the vehicle and crosses the Iron Curtain with Hulka's platoon and they are captured by the communist. Sergeant Hulka escapes and releases a distress signal and John, Russell, Stella and Louise decide to help to rescue their friends from Czechoslovakia. "Stripes" is a silly and funny comedy, but what else could I expect from a cast with the names of Bill Murray, John Candy, John Larroquette and the other comedians. The extended cut is long and most of the jokes are "politically incorrect" or sexists, but also hilarious. This is the first time that I see this 1981 comedy on DVD and I laughed a lot. My vote is six. Title (Brazil): "Recrutas da Pesada" ("Rough Recruiters")

    Director Ivan Reitman brings the gang together for a bit of fun. John (Bill Murray) just got fired from driving a cab. Russell (Harold Ramis) is tired of teaching English to immigrants. They decide to join the army. There they meet Ox (John Candy). Sgt. Hulka (Warren Oates) is there to shape them up. And they're led by the sleazy incompetent Capt. Stillman (John Larroquette). The fact that John and Russell keep getting into trouble means they keep meeting MPs Stella (PJ Soles) and Louise (Sean Young). Bill Murray is his sarcastic self. Harold Ramis is a competent sidekick. But the best fun was had by John Candy who mud wrestled with a whole of beauties. Although not the group's best collaboration, this is still very funny especially if you like Bill Murray's antics.

    Bill Murray and Harold Ramis play two friends who find themselves jobless, broke, and out-of-shape, so impulsively join the army, only to find out that their lark has "serious" consequences for their lives. Marginal comedy is really bolstered by Warren Oates' turn as tough Drill instructor Sgt. Hulka, who isn't remotely going to put up with their immature buffoonery. John Candy also shines as an overweight but game recruit in their platoon, who is ready for anything. Undeniably funny at times, but goes wrong when the platoon takes on a serious rescue mission behind the Iron Curtain,; the tone of this is all wrong, not to mention absurd. Still, this was a big hit, but older viewers may find themselves preferring an old-fashioned military comedy that Abbott & Costello have starred in!

    Ivan Reitman's 'Stripes' is among the funniest military comedies to come from Hollywood. This is also the movie that established Bill Murray, Harold Ramis, John Laroquette and John Candy as comedy actors (and introduced many like Judge Reinhold and John Diehl). Since then, Reitman has reunite with Ramis and Murray to create films like 'Ghostbusters' (which was a smash hit). The key ingredient that makes 'Stripes' work so hilariously is Ramis and Goldberg's script. Reitman, his producers and writers originally wanted to make another Cheech and Chong film but things didn't turn out as expected and they left it to Ramis and Goldberg to readjust the script for actors Bill Murray and Harold Ramis. Now the writers just knew the actors very well so it was easy to rewrite for them and there was plenty of space for improvisation which added to the spontaneity of the humour. The entire cast shared great chemistry and work excellently off each other. Murray and Ramis give some memorable scenes and who could forget their conflicts with Warren Oates's 'Hulka'? And John Candy's unforgettable mud-wrestling scene? One can easily tell that they had a great time filming (which the cast and crew admit to in later interviews). It's been a while since I last saw a film that had me laughing constantly. The first half of the film focuses on the training scenes and the second half on their 'mission' to protect a military R.V. which leads to a little 'battle' in what was then known as Czechoslovakia. Throughout the characters remain consistent, never out of place and I liked that there wasn't too much focus on the final battle scene, leaving the humour balanced. To conclude, this is one of the most ticklish films I've seen. Even memories of it have me laughing. An awesome film to enjoy with friends.

    I had a really fun time watching this clever Bill Murray film. It did not win awards, but this film is not meant to. It is just a fun film that pokes fun at the Army and where you can laugh until your side hurts too much. This is about John Winger who decides to join the military because he feels like he has nothing more to do with his current lifestyle. He drags his friend to join the military and they plan to show the military what it is like to have a good time. When this film was released in 1981, the cast was unknown with the exception of Bill Murray. Murray is really funny in this movie and this would be film that led him and Harold Ramis to be together in Ghostbusters. The whole cast was just great especially the late Warren Oates as the drill sergeant. Overall, this film met my expectations. I was expecting to have a fun time with his film and I did. I rate this film 8/10.

    Ivan Reitman is the Mel Brooks of his generation, which means he takes nothing seriously, and this film is the perfect example. Bill Murray is his typical "everyman", just a plain Joe who is in his late 20's who has no clue what to do with his life. Harold Ramis is his buddy, and the two of them together make enlisting in the Army akin to signing up for Little League. The movie is resplendent with little side jokes and plots. John Candy and his ersatz side kick, played by John Diehl, are constantly doing the Stanly and Ollie routine. John Larroquette plays the typical college graduate who joined the Army to lead men and blow stuff up, and has no clue whatsoever how to do either (Don't laugh too hard, I actually worked with junior Ensigns in the Navy with the same problem). Warren Oats is the only truly straight up character in the entire film, and his attitude is very similar to Bobby Troup's in M*A*S*H (G&* D#$% Army). But you have to love this film, simply because it does what no other film can do, makes a very dangerous and serious profession and turns it into a reflection on the human condition. The film is rated "R" for slight nudity, language, and inferences to drug use, but I think most teenagers can watch this without being corrupted. Definitely a must for any collector of cinema.

    i remember seeing this as a kid when it came out.. and only thing i liked then was when the platoon did the amazing song and dance at graduation which in itself was very impressive, and of course the cute mp's that kept bailing them out of trouble.... but watching it again 20 yrs later there's a ton of good stuff that i missed and can appreciate this comedy ever more .... fully recommended for anyone having a lousy day ... put your feet up grab your snack foods and enjoy one of the best comedies ever made... with an all star cast.. those then they were just emerging. definitely a classic army comedy. solid flick with few cheesy moments even they are likable.

    I am on record as saying Bill Murray is a comedy God. He ruled the 80s (Caddyshack, Stripes, Ghostbusters, Scrooged) stole the 90s (Groundhog Day, What About Bob? Rushmore), and remained relevant in the dubbos by interspersing more serious roles (Lost in Translation, Broken Flowers) in between the funny stuff. Though it must be said that the funny stuff is getting harder to find, Garfield 1 AND 2? In reality a minor cameo in Zombieland was the decade's best effort  I'm not a fan of either Tenenbaums or Steve Zissou. Over the last weekend one of the more retro channels had a mini marathon of classic 80s movies, so over the course of a weekend I sat down and watched Colors, Angel Heart, Enemy Mine and Stripes. Stripes follows the classic strategy of putting funny guys in unexpected situations and letting them act accordingly  Will Ferrell has made a career out of it (whether I think it a worthy career is another matter)  in this case John (Murray) and Russell (Harold Ramis) are down on their luck average joes who decide to enlist in the army to make a few bucks After all what could go wrong? Right? This lends itself to various scenarios that show John, Russell and a cavalcade of disparate characters (including John Candy and Judge Reinhold) as they bumble and fluff their way through basic training under the watchful and vigilant eye of one Sergeant Hulka (Warren Oates). Now as much as I love Murray and this film wouldn't exist without him, Sgt Hulka is what sets Stripes apart. His dogged determination and blunt dealings with his trainees creates a great juxtaposition with John's carefree and anti-rules position, and the two are often at odds with each other over anything remotely pertaining to discipline. Being an 80s comedy there is an inept Captain in charge who has no idea how the army really works, some quasi-hot female MPs who are there to provide John and Russell with something to have sex with, and a variety of non-standard situations to create laughs  a mud wrestling challenge with nubile young women anyone? So after the troop half arses their way through basic training a "could only happen in the movies" event sees them all not only pass but get given the plumb job of guarding the army's new super secret weapon  which looks like a medium sized bus with some cheap metal riveted onto the side panels. Will they get up to mischief and inadvertently set the US on the brink of international conflict? You'll have to watch and find out. Murray shines in his deadpan, dry, I couldn't possibly be more sarcastic  no, wait, yes I can way, Ramis is solid as the straight man reacting to his new surroundings in quite a reasonable way, and Hulka is always there to yell just loud enough and to create enough friction to stir things up and keep the plot moving. As good as the soldiers are, Hulka drives them and the movie to greater heights. His role is truly one of the defining supporting roles of comedy in the 80s. Final Rating  7 / 10. Stripes is funny, lighthearted, painless and likable in every way. It also has just enough gratuitous 80s nudity to top everything off

    I understand the enjoyment of it. The prolonged and arguably dignified ancestry includes Buck Privates, Duck Soup and the like. This cheeky young Bill Murray is firmly anchored in Groucho, the clue I'd consider an early scuffle with a Manhattan matron. The idea is recapturing the same timbre but with a clear post-SNL hipster slacker derision. And like those vintage vehicles were for the classic comedy teams, storytelling amounts to little more than piecing together various sorts of obligatory scenes, cycling through the kinds that entails. You look back on all the moments and not so much the transitions between them. Who needs them? That's supposed to be the attitude one brings to one of these sorts of movies. It has that Animal House feel. Take a rigid institution of authoritarian discipline and formality and throw a big pie in its face. And fart on its head for good measure. Just as John Vernon was the anal-retentive square lording it over our slacker heroes in John Landis' film, Warren Oates plays Sgt. 1st Class Hulka, who gives Murray the most discipline he must've ever had in his life, making him the closest character in the film to give the film cohesion. Otherwise, this lazy but likable classic wastes most of its time overstressing situations contradicted from the start by Murray's character. The star act and his material are essentially misaligned until the tedious, scattered script ultimately labors past basic training. The blessing I think Stripes brings to the golden-age slapstick template is a more vivid ensemble. Yes, In the Navy and A Night at the Opera had plots, but with the attention to detail and ripeness in dialogue and characterization of a present-day cartoon. The peripheral people around the stars of the act were virtually prevented from having too much presence or distinction for fear of upstaging the deal-breaking stars, but in Stripes, others clowning in basic-training include Judge Reinhold's head-bobbing stoner, Conrad Dunn's broad-stroke acknowledgment to Travis Bickle (likely more of a Harold Ramis contribution), and John Candy's soft-hearted fatso, who finds the Laurel to his Hardy in southern boy John Diehl. They all have the kind of indelible character we hope for in especially young performances of actors who later became more prevalent. And yet P.J. Soles and Sean Young are there for one reason, the same one reason all us young guys wanted them in it. Other than that, there is absolutely nothing else. Not a single realistic action is allowed from them. Director Ivan Reitman is a sure merchant. He knows that the cheap laughs are the most certain, that we like to see bunglers get it together without losing their ungainly style, and that it doesn't harm business to slot in a sorority shower scene or nude mud-wrestling competition every 30 minutes or so. Vietnam was by now a bygone phase, and this is Reagan's Good Army. When Ivan Reitman wants to ambush the Eastern Bloc in a Winnebago crammed with rockets, he has the certified OK for dozens of tanks, explosions, shootouts and hand-to-hand combat moments. But believe me, it was a great deal funnier when we were ten.
