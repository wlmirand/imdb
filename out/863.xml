 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  In the late 1930s, in Ferrara, Italy, the Finzi-Contini are one of the leading families, wealthy, aristocratic, urbane; they are also Jewish. Their adult children, Micol and Alberto, gather a circle of friends for constant rounds of tennis and parties at their villa with its lovely grounds, keeping the rest of the world at bay. Into the circle steps Giorgio, a Jew from the middle class who falls in love with Micol. She seems to toy with him, and even makes love to one of his friends while she knows Giorgio is watching. While his love cannot seem to break through to her to draw her out of her garden idyll, the forces of politics close in.

    A stunner. Vittorio De Sica's late career masterpiece exposes the hopeless plight a lot of Italian Jews faced as the lunatic Mussolini got further and further into bed with Hitler during WWII. The Finzi-Continis, a well-to-do family of intellectuals fail to realize the rising tide of anti-semitism around them as their vast estate becomes more and more a sanctuary for their equally blind friends. Unrequited love and missed chances at romance are dwarfed in importance as the Nazis move in. This is a very unsettling movie as you're well aware of what is going to happen to these people. De Sica (and five or six uncredited scriptwriters) creates a real sense of dread and the film is populated with an excellent cast. Lino Capolicchio is the standout, hopelessly in love with Finzi-Contini d&eacute;butante Dominique Sanda. As Sanda's infirm brother, Helmut Berger personifies an entire race of people about to be systematically eliminated. Fabio Testi and Romolo Valli (excellent as Capolicchio's grotesquely optimistic father) are in it too.

    No doubt this film is prettily photographed. And everyone in it is very pretty too, with their gleaming tennis whites and Sunday best dresses. For most of the movie we observe the characters dreamily cycling into one scene in a bit of this "garden" (in reality an amorphous amalgam of four private estates) and languorously cycling out, quite untroubled by bellicose drum rolls sounding off in other bits of Europe just to the north. As for clearly identifying the chief protagonists and following their fortunes, the poor viewer has a hard time trying to tell these lovely people apart one from the other. In fact, for me the only true moments of any dramatic force in the film occurs in the last scene in the dark toned schoolroom, leagues away from the dazzling sun. Out of the whole film, it is only here that tense emotions truly grip the audience with any convincing force. But this is too little, too late. De Sica has wasted too much filmic time presenting us with bloodless ciphers in his candy floss world for us to give a tinker's cuss for these folks and their final dire outcome.

    The cast and technical team, led by de Sica created a timeless, moving story of romance set in the context of the mundane and the stupidity of arrogant mobs. The surprise is that a film could accurately convey how this actually happens and do it well. (If only films could change the world.) The frankness with which female sexuality is presented in this film reminds you of Tennessee Williams but the subject of this movie is much more important to us than sexual politics per se. This story deals with institutionalized xenophobia and greed that has characterized western civilization during the last century and which is today the source of human suffering and ecological disaster. De Sica's tale lets us identify with real participants and victims of the fascist Italian pogrom in a way that let's you clearly see that there are people around you who would do this to you and your children if they have the chance. You will enjoy this film for the nostalgia in it's design and the cinematography, settings, costume and locations and for the absence of conceits and cinema effects. Images and montage reveal the story with appropriate music. Because this quality is like a luscious treat, it lures you into a web of understanding of things you didn't expect and when you give yourself up to this experience, you never return, you experience the reward love offers and the cost.

    This is a parable (& a wake-up call) to all those who feel sufficiently insulated from global pressures so that they feel immune to the effects to which most other people are subject. The Finzi-Continis are an aristocratic, wealthy, "connected" Jewish family in Italy in the 1930s-40s. Mussolini's Fascist party followed the lead of Germany's Hitler/Nazis' anti-Semitism and purging of Jews, at first slowly following suit (denying Jews library use was among the earlier, then denying university graduation for Jews, then forbidding marriage between Jews and non-Jews, then denying any possibility of non-Jews working for Jews), etc., etc. They increasingly tightened their anti-Semitic noose. The social position of the Finzi-Continis and their walled garden seemed (at first) to keep these gathering restrictions at bay and inconsequential. E.g., when (early on) Jews were prohibited from using public tennis courts, young Jews flocked to the estate garden of the aristocratic Finzi-Continis, which had tennis courts. At first, they have little concern with the gradually tightening restrictions, the increasing anti-Semitism, and no sense there's a growing tsunami. But restrictions kept tightening much further. I saw the movie at a retired university faculty film series presenting great films. There were a number of hankies daubing eyes at the conclusion. I had problems keeping some of the film's 20-ish male characters distinct from each other (maybe those fluent in Italian wouldn't have that problem) as well as in some of the flashbacks to earlier times. Also the English subtitles sometimes quit the screen before I'd completely read them. BUT, all in all, this is a VERY important, consequential film that I've wanted to see for years. "No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main. If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy friend's or of thine own were. Any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind; and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee..........." -- John Donne

    There is a really good review of this movie by another user (his summary is "imperfect but unforgettable"), so if you can check that out please. If you read it, you will also understand that there is a lot of (background) knowledge/info in this comment. Which begs the question: Do you have to know all of this (like the poem that utilizes the same location?) to fully understand and enjoy this movie? Or is it possible to watch it without prior knowledge? It's a difficult question to answer. But as it is, I can only answer that this indeed is unforgettable. It's story core is really heavy and while there are some sub-stories interwoven into this, you always have this feeling of uncertainty running through it. Still the characters are not far from blandness and never fully engage you. The story seems confusing (though it is simple enough, it seems to be more complicated), which takes you a bit off it. (or that could be the case, depending on your concentration on it) There is space for improvement on this, though it does not take anything away from the ending ...

    "Nostalgia is self destruction." Â– Adrienne Rich "The Garden of the Finzi-Continis" takes place in fascist Italy during the reign of Mussolini. World War 2 is on the horizon and already racial laws are being implemented. Italian Jews have been banned from public schools, marrying non Jews, phone records, libraries, obituaries, using servants and are subject to strict curfews. Gradually the rights of Jews are eradicated, even the wealthiest Jewish families reduced to third class citizens. Slowly a race is made invisible. Against this backdrop is told the story of two Jewish families, the affluent and aristocratic Finzi-Contini family and the middle class Bassani family. The Finzi-Continis live a cloistered existence within the confines of their palatial estate. Surrounded by tall walls and a vast garden, the family lives in a dream world, believing that fascism will leave their lavish lives untouched. Director Vittorio de Sica uses overexposed, bleached images and white clothing to suggest that these wealthy Jews live within an almost idyllic haven. When the family hosts tennis games for friends and family, de Sica shoots them like innocent forest nymphs, frolicking in Eden. Of course, outside the stone walls of the Finzi-Contini estate, trouble brews. The Bassani family adjusts to Mussolini's racist laws with success at first, their father stating that despite their new limitations they can still live a reasonably secure existence. Their daughter will simply have to be home schooled, their maid will have to be smuggled in and their son, Giorgio, will simply have to use the private libraries of friends. No big deal. They can adjust. Right? The widespread complacency is shocking. It's not just a question of non-Jews ignoring these racist laws, but of Jews accepting these laws outright for fear of rocking the boat. The Bassani's submit and the Finzi-Contini's ignore. And even if they wanted to challenge Mussolini's racist segregation policies, how would they go about doing so? During one scene, in which Giorgio is kicked out of a public library, de Sica makes it clear that when the world begins to collapse, it's never anyone's fault. Power is fragmented and everyone is fearfully following orders, obeying rules that somebody else devised. Everything is compartmentalised, sectioned off and objections are funnelled through never-ending mazes. To fight an organised system would take organised dissent on a vast array of fronts. And so Jews and Gentiles submit to the racist laws. The war will be over soon, they hope, and Italy and Germany will soon emerge victorious. Just abide and hope that things change. Right? Big mistake. The second half of the film focuses on the romance between Giorgio Bassani and Micol Finzi-Contini. Despite Micol's wealth and beauty, Giorgio loves her primarily for the sense of tranquillity she represents. He knew her during her childhood, and so begins to see her as an almost nostalgic symbol. She represents a snapshot in time, a personification of Europe before things went bad. Many have complained that Micol is a cipher in the film. That she prowls her estate like a zombie and that she never gives a reason for rejecting Giorgio's advances. But this is the film's very point. Micol is an idealised vision of the world, simultaneously deluding herself and representative of mass denial. She is a ghost, the past, and Giorgio cannot attain her because she has long turned her back to the living world. This romance thus abstracts many of the themes that take place in the film. Firstly, it illustrates the false belief held by both Gentiles and Jews that if they isolate themselves and mind their own business, they may be spared the horrors of this hostile political climate. Secondly, it shows that no amount of wealth, prestige and education can defend you against mindless, irrational bigotry. Finally, it highlights the dangers of Jewish ethnocentricity. To many, Judaism is a cultural fortresses that keeps outsiders out and insiders in (the degree to which Jewish communities are isolated from their host cultures is even reflected at the genetic level). Of course, one should not have to assimilate to avoid persecution, but this ethnocentricity is one reason why Jewish history is one of success and growth followed by persecution and slaughter. A cycle which plays out repeatedly from the Egyptian Exodus to the Holocaust. Beyond this, the the behaviour of all the film's characters echo that of German, Italian and International communities, who, during WW2, were likewise guilty of both dangerous conformity and violent disinterest. 9/10 Â– Western Holocaust films have colonised our minds with a very "American view" of the Holocaust. They present us with false iconography, freak show myths which exploit visual touchstones. But the Holocaust was not a horror movie. It unfolded with the banality of everyday life, in bright colours, ordinary day to day activities rarely upset. There was nothing alien about the Holocaust. The world didn't break down or erupt into violence. Instead it stood back with a serene, far more chilling acceptance. Perhaps this is why, today, documentary footage of Hitler relaxing with his family in the Bavarian Alps is far more horrific than any of his loud mouthed speeches. See Lina Wertm&uuml;ller's "Seven Beauties" and Lajos Koltai's "Fateless". Worth multiple viewings.

    The Garden of the Finzi-Continis is simply an experience not to be missed for any serious foreign film lover. It has a beautiful innocence to it in this tale of the early days of the Finzi-Continis family before WWII. It shows their personal lives and their dreams for love and success, never guessing their future. Then it shows the tragedy and sadness in time lost and how really horrible and wrong war is. It is beautiful, yet somehow a very haunting film with a wistful score, that seems to be longing for things unattainable. It makes you feel like you're watching an era or time gone by that can never be again. And maybe it's not good to be so naive. Because war comes and life never really recovers from it. But we can remember love... This is a masterpiece to watch and remember.

    The film, to me, is about survival of one's identity. Micol identifies with her childhood and could not let go of it in relation to her childhood sweetheart, Georgio, even while her physical desires develop and intrude. The conflict in her mind is exposed by her enticing Georgio but turning cold when he makes the moves on her. She said she could not breath. Similar to what happened to the Jews of Italy, they were drawn in by their identity. For the Italian Jews, they identified with the Italian civilization, thinking they were a part of it. Georgio identifies with Micol. As the Jews were slowly extracted from theirs, they kept on with those early ideas. Same with Georgio, he kept on with pursuing her. Then finally when he saw she had sex with someone completely different from him and her---and she even turns the light on to show him---he snaps out of it. He finally grasps the physial reality of the situation. The process is just as his father says: better you die (your relationship with Micol, your identity as being part of her world and visa versa) young and hence you have more time to start from zero. And for the Jews: better your notions of being part of the civility of Italian society die early so you have time to rebuild elsewhere. The others in the garden didn't die in time and so became unwilling prisoners, in contrast to their voluntary enprisonment behind the walls of their own estate. Once in prison, Micol finally behaves as a responsible, caring adult, but alas, too late. Prior to that, while in France, Georgio was told of the Nazi horrors and how one man escapes by shedding his identity and saying he has converted to Nazism. Georgio says he won't escape because he had too many ties back in Italy. His identity then was bound to the fantasy of the Jews in the garden, even though his realistic father says they are not his type. Survival of one's identity has been the cause of much suffering when outside, physical, uncontrollable reality intrudes. Unfortunately, the identity we construct in order to feel a sense of belonging which gives us a sense of power, often subtracts from a balanced, caring, and even civilized way. As a result, religious, nationalist conflicts have caused too much suffering to justify the gains offered by these simple-minded (childish?) views.

    Much like Louis Malle's similarly themed film from 1987 AU REVOIR, LES ENFANTS, Vittorio daSica's THE GARDEN OF THE FINZI-CONTINI's is a meditative piece on the relatively safe haven of a group of people -- in this case, an entire family of wealthy Jews who enjoy a life of privilege as the horrors of World War II and anti-Semitism rages on. The Finzi-Contini's, however, believe that their position of wealth and their very home will shield them from being touched, and they move on, oblivious to the world outside, in a frozen period of time and space that seems, for a moment, to spare them, until it becomes rather clear that the walls that so protected them are beginning to crumble and that they are headed towards an inevitable train wreck which will destroy all that they know. As their rights and the rights of the Jewish people are stripped away from them, they find themselves suddenly awake into a reality they cannot understand, but must move into. DaSica's movie is a slow-moving lyrical poem which differs from his earlier Neo-Realist work, and captures in its running time this illusionary reality as if all this were a dream that the Finzi-Continis were having. The filtered lens only maximizes the almost enchanted beauty that pours through from the screen and onto the viewers' eyes; indeed, this is nostalgia for a time gone by, a trip down memory lane and a subtle incursion into a denouncement of the horrors of war which never rears its ugly head but whose presence ultimately swallows a family, whole.

    Director Vittorio De Sica eschews the neo-realism that defined his earliest work and takes a more poetic approach with this story about a wealthy, privileged family who shut themselves away from the encroaching threat of fascism in the early days of WWII Italy. They ultimately find that their elite status does not protect them from the fascist threat, and the quietly devastating ending shows the family being separated, perhaps forever, as they are rounded up and herded into lines like so much cattle. The ending makes this film memorable, but everything proceeding it struck me as rather lightweight, given the subject matter. This isn't a movie I think back on as a masterpiece, and I think its reputation rests somewhat on the fact that De Sica, a respected master, directed it. Grade: B+

    A stunner. Vittorio De Sica's late career masterpiece exposes the hopeless plight a lot of Italian Jews faced as the lunatic Mussolini got further and further into bed with Hitler during WWII. The Finzi-Continis, a well-to-do family of intellectuals fail to realize the rising tide of anti-semitism around them as their vast estate becomes more and more a sanctuary for their equally blind friends. Unrequited love and missed chances at romance are dwarfed in importance as the Nazis move in. This is a very unsettling movie as you're well aware of what is going to happen to these people. De Sica (and five or six uncredited scriptwriters) creates a real sense of dread and the film is populated with an excellent cast. Lino Capolicchio is the standout, hopelessly in love with Finzi-Contini d&eacute;butante Dominique Sanda. As Sanda's infirm brother, Helmut Berger personifies an entire race of people about to be systematically eliminated. Fabio Testi and Romolo Valli (excellent as Capolicchio's grotesquely optimistic father) are in it too.

    "Nostalgia is self destruction." Â– Adrienne Rich "The Garden of the Finzi-Continis" takes place in fascist Italy during the reign of Mussolini. World War 2 is on the horizon and already racial laws are being implemented. Italian Jews have been banned from public schools, marrying non Jews, phone records, libraries, obituaries, using servants and are subject to strict curfews. Gradually the rights of Jews are eradicated, even the wealthiest Jewish families reduced to third class citizens. Slowly a race is made invisible. Against this backdrop is told the story of two Jewish families, the affluent and aristocratic Finzi-Contini family and the middle class Bassani family. The Finzi-Continis live a cloistered existence within the confines of their palatial estate. Surrounded by tall walls and a vast garden, the family lives in a dream world, believing that fascism will leave their lavish lives untouched. Director Vittorio de Sica uses overexposed, bleached images and white clothing to suggest that these wealthy Jews live within an almost idyllic haven. When the family hosts tennis games for friends and family, de Sica shoots them like innocent forest nymphs, frolicking in Eden. Of course, outside the stone walls of the Finzi-Contini estate, trouble brews. The Bassani family adjusts to Mussolini's racist laws with success at first, their father stating that despite their new limitations they can still live a reasonably secure existence. Their daughter will simply have to be home schooled, their maid will have to be smuggled in and their son, Giorgio, will simply have to use the private libraries of friends. No big deal. They can adjust. Right? The widespread complacency is shocking. It's not just a question of non-Jews ignoring these racist laws, but of Jews accepting these laws outright for fear of rocking the boat. The Bassani's submit and the Finzi-Contini's ignore. And even if they wanted to challenge Mussolini's racist segregation policies, how would they go about doing so? During one scene, in which Giorgio is kicked out of a public library, de Sica makes it clear that when the world begins to collapse, it's never anyone's fault. Power is fragmented and everyone is fearfully following orders, obeying rules that somebody else devised. Everything is compartmentalised, sectioned off and objections are funnelled through never-ending mazes. To fight an organised system would take organised dissent on a vast array of fronts. And so Jews and Gentiles submit to the racist laws. The war will be over soon, they hope, and Italy and Germany will soon emerge victorious. Just abide and hope that things change. Right? Big mistake. The second half of the film focuses on the romance between Giorgio Bassani and Micol Finzi-Contini. Despite Micol's wealth and beauty, Giorgio loves her primarily for the sense of tranquillity she represents. He knew her during her childhood, and so begins to see her as an almost nostalgic symbol. She represents a snapshot in time, a personification of Europe before things went bad. Many have complained that Micol is a cipher in the film. That she prowls her estate like a zombie and that she never gives a reason for rejecting Giorgio's advances. But this is the film's very point. Micol is an idealised vision of the world, simultaneously deluding herself and representative of mass denial. She is a ghost, the past, and Giorgio cannot attain her because she has long turned her back to the living world. This romance thus abstracts many of the themes that take place in the film. Firstly, it illustrates the false belief held by both Gentiles and Jews that if they isolate themselves and mind their own business, they may be spared the horrors of this hostile political climate. Secondly, it shows that no amount of wealth, prestige and education can defend you against mindless, irrational bigotry. Finally, it highlights the dangers of Jewish ethnocentricity. To many, Judaism is a cultural fortresses that keeps outsiders out and insiders in (the degree to which Jewish communities are isolated from their host cultures is even reflected at the genetic level). Of course, one should not have to assimilate to avoid persecution, but this ethnocentricity is one reason why Jewish history is one of success and growth followed by persecution and slaughter. A cycle which plays out repeatedly from the Egyptian Exodus to the Holocaust. Beyond this, the the behaviour of all the film's characters echo that of German, Italian and International communities, who, during WW2, were likewise guilty of both dangerous conformity and violent disinterest. 9/10 Â– Western Holocaust films have colonised our minds with a very "American view" of the Holocaust. They present us with false iconography, freak show myths which exploit visual touchstones. But the Holocaust was not a horror movie. It unfolded with the banality of everyday life, in bright colours, ordinary day to day activities rarely upset. There was nothing alien about the Holocaust. The world didn't break down or erupt into violence. Instead it stood back with a serene, far more chilling acceptance. Perhaps this is why, today, documentary footage of Hitler relaxing with his family in the Bavarian Alps is far more horrific than any of his loud mouthed speeches. See Lina Wertm&uuml;ller's "Seven Beauties" and Lajos Koltai's "Fateless". Worth multiple viewings.

    The Garden of the Finzi-Continis is simply an experience not to be missed for any serious foreign film lover. It has a beautiful innocence to it in this tale of the early days of the Finzi-Continis family before WWII. It shows their personal lives and their dreams for love and success, never guessing their future. Then it shows the tragedy and sadness in time lost and how really horrible and wrong war is. It is beautiful, yet somehow a very haunting film with a wistful score, that seems to be longing for things unattainable. It makes you feel like you're watching an era or time gone by that can never be again. And maybe it's not good to be so naive. Because war comes and life never really recovers from it. But we can remember love... This is a masterpiece to watch and remember.

    The film, to me, is about survival of one's identity. Micol identifies with her childhood and could not let go of it in relation to her childhood sweetheart, Georgio, even while her physical desires develop and intrude. The conflict in her mind is exposed by her enticing Georgio but turning cold when he makes the moves on her. She said she could not breath. Similar to what happened to the Jews of Italy, they were drawn in by their identity. For the Italian Jews, they identified with the Italian civilization, thinking they were a part of it. Georgio identifies with Micol. As the Jews were slowly extracted from theirs, they kept on with those early ideas. Same with Georgio, he kept on with pursuing her. Then finally when he saw she had sex with someone completely different from him and her---and she even turns the light on to show him---he snaps out of it. He finally grasps the physial reality of the situation. The process is just as his father says: better you die (your relationship with Micol, your identity as being part of her world and visa versa) young and hence you have more time to start from zero. And for the Jews: better your notions of being part of the civility of Italian society die early so you have time to rebuild elsewhere. The others in the garden didn't die in time and so became unwilling prisoners, in contrast to their voluntary enprisonment behind the walls of their own estate. Once in prison, Micol finally behaves as a responsible, caring adult, but alas, too late. Prior to that, while in France, Georgio was told of the Nazi horrors and how one man escapes by shedding his identity and saying he has converted to Nazism. Georgio says he won't escape because he had too many ties back in Italy. His identity then was bound to the fantasy of the Jews in the garden, even though his realistic father says they are not his type. Survival of one's identity has been the cause of much suffering when outside, physical, uncontrollable reality intrudes. Unfortunately, the identity we construct in order to feel a sense of belonging which gives us a sense of power, often subtracts from a balanced, caring, and even civilized way. As a result, religious, nationalist conflicts have caused too much suffering to justify the gains offered by these simple-minded (childish?) views.

    Much like Louis Malle's similarly themed film from 1987 AU REVOIR, LES ENFANTS, Vittorio daSica's THE GARDEN OF THE FINZI-CONTINI's is a meditative piece on the relatively safe haven of a group of people -- in this case, an entire family of wealthy Jews who enjoy a life of privilege as the horrors of World War II and anti-Semitism rages on. The Finzi-Contini's, however, believe that their position of wealth and their very home will shield them from being touched, and they move on, oblivious to the world outside, in a frozen period of time and space that seems, for a moment, to spare them, until it becomes rather clear that the walls that so protected them are beginning to crumble and that they are headed towards an inevitable train wreck which will destroy all that they know. As their rights and the rights of the Jewish people are stripped away from them, they find themselves suddenly awake into a reality they cannot understand, but must move into. DaSica's movie is a slow-moving lyrical poem which differs from his earlier Neo-Realist work, and captures in its running time this illusionary reality as if all this were a dream that the Finzi-Continis were having. The filtered lens only maximizes the almost enchanted beauty that pours through from the screen and onto the viewers' eyes; indeed, this is nostalgia for a time gone by, a trip down memory lane and a subtle incursion into a denouncement of the horrors of war which never rears its ugly head but whose presence ultimately swallows a family, whole.

    Director Vittorio De Sica eschews the neo-realism that defined his earliest work and takes a more poetic approach with this story about a wealthy, privileged family who shut themselves away from the encroaching threat of fascism in the early days of WWII Italy. They ultimately find that their elite status does not protect them from the fascist threat, and the quietly devastating ending shows the family being separated, perhaps forever, as they are rounded up and herded into lines like so much cattle. The ending makes this film memorable, but everything proceeding it struck me as rather lightweight, given the subject matter. This isn't a movie I think back on as a masterpiece, and I think its reputation rests somewhat on the fact that De Sica, a respected master, directed it. Grade: B+

    A stunner. Vittorio De Sica's late career masterpiece exposes the hopeless plight a lot of Italian Jews faced as the lunatic Mussolini got further and further into bed with Hitler during WWII. The Finzi-Continis, a well-to-do family of intellectuals fail to realize the rising tide of anti-semitism around them as their vast estate becomes more and more a sanctuary for their equally blind friends. Unrequited love and missed chances at romance are dwarfed in importance as the Nazis move in. This is a very unsettling movie as you're well aware of what is going to happen to these people. De Sica (and five or six uncredited scriptwriters) creates a real sense of dread and the film is populated with an excellent cast. Lino Capolicchio is the standout, hopelessly in love with Finzi-Contini d&eacute;butante Dominique Sanda. As Sanda's infirm brother, Helmut Berger personifies an entire race of people about to be systematically eliminated. Fabio Testi and Romolo Valli (excellent as Capolicchio's grotesquely optimistic father) are in it too.

    No doubt this film is prettily photographed. And everyone in it is very pretty too, with their gleaming tennis whites and Sunday best dresses. For most of the movie we observe the characters dreamily cycling into one scene in a bit of this "garden" (in reality an amorphous amalgam of four private estates) and languorously cycling out, quite untroubled by bellicose drum rolls sounding off in other bits of Europe just to the north. As for clearly identifying the chief protagonists and following their fortunes, the poor viewer has a hard time trying to tell these lovely people apart one from the other. In fact, for me the only true moments of any dramatic force in the film occurs in the last scene in the dark toned schoolroom, leagues away from the dazzling sun. Out of the whole film, it is only here that tense emotions truly grip the audience with any convincing force. But this is too little, too late. De Sica has wasted too much filmic time presenting us with bloodless ciphers in his candy floss world for us to give a tinker's cuss for these folks and their final dire outcome.

    The cast and technical team, led by de Sica created a timeless, moving story of romance set in the context of the mundane and the stupidity of arrogant mobs. The surprise is that a film could accurately convey how this actually happens and do it well. (If only films could change the world.) The frankness with which female sexuality is presented in this film reminds you of Tennessee Williams but the subject of this movie is much more important to us than sexual politics per se. This story deals with institutionalized xenophobia and greed that has characterized western civilization during the last century and which is today the source of human suffering and ecological disaster. De Sica's tale lets us identify with real participants and victims of the fascist Italian pogrom in a way that let's you clearly see that there are people around you who would do this to you and your children if they have the chance. You will enjoy this film for the nostalgia in it's design and the cinematography, settings, costume and locations and for the absence of conceits and cinema effects. Images and montage reveal the story with appropriate music. Because this quality is like a luscious treat, it lures you into a web of understanding of things you didn't expect and when you give yourself up to this experience, you never return, you experience the reward love offers and the cost.

    This is a parable (& a wake-up call) to all those who feel sufficiently insulated from global pressures so that they feel immune to the effects to which most other people are subject. The Finzi-Continis are an aristocratic, wealthy, "connected" Jewish family in Italy in the 1930s-40s. Mussolini's Fascist party followed the lead of Germany's Hitler/Nazis' anti-Semitism and purging of Jews, at first slowly following suit (denying Jews library use was among the earlier, then denying university graduation for Jews, then forbidding marriage between Jews and non-Jews, then denying any possibility of non-Jews working for Jews), etc., etc. They increasingly tightened their anti-Semitic noose. The social position of the Finzi-Continis and their walled garden seemed (at first) to keep these gathering restrictions at bay and inconsequential. E.g., when (early on) Jews were prohibited from using public tennis courts, young Jews flocked to the estate garden of the aristocratic Finzi-Continis, which had tennis courts. At first, they have little concern with the gradually tightening restrictions, the increasing anti-Semitism, and no sense there's a growing tsunami. But restrictions kept tightening much further. I saw the movie at a retired university faculty film series presenting great films. There were a number of hankies daubing eyes at the conclusion. I had problems keeping some of the film's 20-ish male characters distinct from each other (maybe those fluent in Italian wouldn't have that problem) as well as in some of the flashbacks to earlier times. Also the English subtitles sometimes quit the screen before I'd completely read them. BUT, all in all, this is a VERY important, consequential film that I've wanted to see for years. "No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main. If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy friend's or of thine own were. Any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind; and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee..........." -- John Donne

    There is a really good review of this movie by another user (his summary is "imperfect but unforgettable"), so if you can check that out please. If you read it, you will also understand that there is a lot of (background) knowledge/info in this comment. Which begs the question: Do you have to know all of this (like the poem that utilizes the same location?) to fully understand and enjoy this movie? Or is it possible to watch it without prior knowledge? It's a difficult question to answer. But as it is, I can only answer that this indeed is unforgettable. It's story core is really heavy and while there are some sub-stories interwoven into this, you always have this feeling of uncertainty running through it. Still the characters are not far from blandness and never fully engage you. The story seems confusing (though it is simple enough, it seems to be more complicated), which takes you a bit off it. (or that could be the case, depending on your concentration on it) There is space for improvement on this, though it does not take anything away from the ending ...

    "Nostalgia is self destruction." Â– Adrienne Rich "The Garden of the Finzi-Continis" takes place in fascist Italy during the reign of Mussolini. World War 2 is on the horizon and already racial laws are being implemented. Italian Jews have been banned from public schools, marrying non Jews, phone records, libraries, obituaries, using servants and are subject to strict curfews. Gradually the rights of Jews are eradicated, even the wealthiest Jewish families reduced to third class citizens. Slowly a race is made invisible. Against this backdrop is told the story of two Jewish families, the affluent and aristocratic Finzi-Contini family and the middle class Bassani family. The Finzi-Continis live a cloistered existence within the confines of their palatial estate. Surrounded by tall walls and a vast garden, the family lives in a dream world, believing that fascism will leave their lavish lives untouched. Director Vittorio de Sica uses overexposed, bleached images and white clothing to suggest that these wealthy Jews live within an almost idyllic haven. When the family hosts tennis games for friends and family, de Sica shoots them like innocent forest nymphs, frolicking in Eden. Of course, outside the stone walls of the Finzi-Contini estate, trouble brews. The Bassani family adjusts to Mussolini's racist laws with success at first, their father stating that despite their new limitations they can still live a reasonably secure existence. Their daughter will simply have to be home schooled, their maid will have to be smuggled in and their son, Giorgio, will simply have to use the private libraries of friends. No big deal. They can adjust. Right? The widespread complacency is shocking. It's not just a question of non-Jews ignoring these racist laws, but of Jews accepting these laws outright for fear of rocking the boat. The Bassani's submit and the Finzi-Contini's ignore. And even if they wanted to challenge Mussolini's racist segregation policies, how would they go about doing so? During one scene, in which Giorgio is kicked out of a public library, de Sica makes it clear that when the world begins to collapse, it's never anyone's fault. Power is fragmented and everyone is fearfully following orders, obeying rules that somebody else devised. Everything is compartmentalised, sectioned off and objections are funnelled through never-ending mazes. To fight an organised system would take organised dissent on a vast array of fronts. And so Jews and Gentiles submit to the racist laws. The war will be over soon, they hope, and Italy and Germany will soon emerge victorious. Just abide and hope that things change. Right? Big mistake. The second half of the film focuses on the romance between Giorgio Bassani and Micol Finzi-Contini. Despite Micol's wealth and beauty, Giorgio loves her primarily for the sense of tranquillity she represents. He knew her during her childhood, and so begins to see her as an almost nostalgic symbol. She represents a snapshot in time, a personification of Europe before things went bad. Many have complained that Micol is a cipher in the film. That she prowls her estate like a zombie and that she never gives a reason for rejecting Giorgio's advances. But this is the film's very point. Micol is an idealised vision of the world, simultaneously deluding herself and representative of mass denial. She is a ghost, the past, and Giorgio cannot attain her because she has long turned her back to the living world. This romance thus abstracts many of the themes that take place in the film. Firstly, it illustrates the false belief held by both Gentiles and Jews that if they isolate themselves and mind their own business, they may be spared the horrors of this hostile political climate. Secondly, it shows that no amount of wealth, prestige and education can defend you against mindless, irrational bigotry. Finally, it highlights the dangers of Jewish ethnocentricity. To many, Judaism is a cultural fortresses that keeps outsiders out and insiders in (the degree to which Jewish communities are isolated from their host cultures is even reflected at the genetic level). Of course, one should not have to assimilate to avoid persecution, but this ethnocentricity is one reason why Jewish history is one of success and growth followed by persecution and slaughter. A cycle which plays out repeatedly from the Egyptian Exodus to the Holocaust. Beyond this, the the behaviour of all the film's characters echo that of German, Italian and International communities, who, during WW2, were likewise guilty of both dangerous conformity and violent disinterest. 9/10 Â– Western Holocaust films have colonised our minds with a very "American view" of the Holocaust. They present us with false iconography, freak show myths which exploit visual touchstones. But the Holocaust was not a horror movie. It unfolded with the banality of everyday life, in bright colours, ordinary day to day activities rarely upset. There was nothing alien about the Holocaust. The world didn't break down or erupt into violence. Instead it stood back with a serene, far more chilling acceptance. Perhaps this is why, today, documentary footage of Hitler relaxing with his family in the Bavarian Alps is far more horrific than any of his loud mouthed speeches.

Unfortunately, the identity we construct in order to feel a sense of belonging which gives us a sense of power, often subtracts from a balanced, caring, and even civilized way. As a result, religious, nationalist conflicts have caused too much suffering to justify the gains offered by these simple-minded (childish?) views.
