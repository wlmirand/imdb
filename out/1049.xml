    This wasn't the best movie I've seen in recent times but it was a fun movie. I liked the concept of holding the oldies hostage while they sort their affairs out. The bonus I guess is that if your're a fan of Jennifer Love Hewitt as I am she's in this movie and her role though minor is good, and hey she's kinda hot you know so that's a bonus. I can't really fault the film and yes there's an awful lot of bad reviews around about it but I think it's well worth the 6/10 I gave it. It's a fun film for everyone, without being too over sentimental or sugar filled. I was surprised to see Jennifer Tilly in this as I felt it too lightweight for her, but there you go guess she needed the work.

    No matter how you beat around the bush this movie is still a good movie. Even though at times it can be sappy, like when Grover has his temper tantrum (which was absolutely funny) its still cute. My favorite part would have to be when the parents are dancing, it was so cute. But then you want to wonder what was going on with Mark's folks I mean at one point I was trying to understand why they were looking like they had sex the that night. When TJ started playing " Its Not Unusual" you see their heads pop out. Why would they be having sex when other people were around, thats kind of weird. Another thing it was kind of grimy how the fist thing that Mrs. Beindorf notices about her husband is his car. what was up with the nosy behind neighbor? These scenes really made you really want to go "hmmmmmm"? I love the part when Mr. Beindorf tells his wife that Mr. Krump would be his attorney. Krump looks at the wife and turns to Beindorf and say " I can get you the house, but kids might be a problem" All in all this movie is still good.

    This film has quite possibly one of the most unrealistic premises on the face of the earth. Two kids lock up their parents in the basement and when other kids hear of it they too lock their parents in the same basement. Stupid. The film is rancid with clich&eacute;s of the worst kind. For example the main kid is picked on unmercifully by a bully who then becomes a good friend or the neighbor who thinks of himself as the mayor interferes with the kids' plan. The thing that bugs me the most is the kids, after kidnapping their parents, spend one count 'em one day in juvenile hall and then get off Scot free. In fact two of them get to go to Hawaii. The police in the film are as unrealistic as a car with wings. Nevertheless I find myself continuing to watch it when it comes on TV. It's entertaining at best. I give it ** out of ****

    This comedy, about a teenager and his younger sister who lock their parents in the basement until they work out their marital problems, is not as bad as it sounds. We wind up with a bunch of kids upstairs who know how to relate to one another but gradually have to work out how to keep practical things running, and a bunch of adults downstairs who are just the opposite. In truth, neither side does very well, but at least this is not the tired condescension of the kids screwing up and needing to be rescued by the adults: both groups are portrayed with a mix of severity and sympathy. Throw in a meddling retired chief of police across the street, and make him Ray Walston whom I think everybody loved most in "Picket Fences," and you have a film that is very entertaining, and also carries across some deeper meaning about what contributions young people and older ones can make to each other's ongoing development. Kyle Howard was 18 trying to play 14, which took a good deal of suspension of disbelief, but that miscasting seems to be an obsession Hollywood just can't seem to grow out of.

    'House Arrest' is a really cute movie and hopefully will influence parents to think about things before just getting a divorce. This movie may not be the most realistic portrayal of how a kid would act when he found out his parents were thinking about splitting (ie locking your parents in the basement) but the reactions are pretty genuine in the fact that just about all kids have problems with their parents. Some things were def. over-exaggerated though, like when Grover (Kyle Howard) finds divorce papers in the mail and then 'flips' out by shoving a bunch of papers around and knocking stuff over. No kid, well usually, would be that mad about their parents divorcing (I'm sure they would be upset, maybe cry, but like wrecking stuff in some sort of manner, yea right). The acting wasn't bad, I thought it was pretty good all around. The story was funny and if your parents aren't like any of the ones in the movie, you probably will appreciate your own family more. I recommend seeing this if you can, it's on HBO a lot.

    House Arrest is one of the only movies I can remember from when I was younger. The thing that stands out most in my mind is the songs (soundtrack). It really complimented the story, which was very funny and thoughtful, and made the whole experience worthwhile. The main character, Grover, is a picturesque hero... always trying so hard to do what he thinks is right, and not always successful. Grover's parents and little sister are people that I think a majority of us viewers can relate to. Every family has problems, and the way that those problems are addressed in this movie is unique and memorable. All of the quirky characters really make this movie a delightful experience. I would recommend it to anyone, its a wholesome good time.

    These people's awful kids included. Just to be clear on where I'm coming from, I booed when Janet and Ned sucked face at the end. And that stupid, stupidstupidstupid Brooke-Grover clich&eacute;, come on. I hate movies set in the suburbs because I despise the suburbs. I hate movies about screeching, arguing, suburban married people who hate each other, because I hate screeching suburban married conventionalist dumbasses who hate each other. House Arrest was a 90 minute reminder of why I don't understand and ultimately don't care why these types of people marry each other, and hope they ALL get divorced and give the world some much needed peace. So I guess we're back to Carmenjonze's First Law of Unwatchable Movies...a telling overabundance of violins, flutes and pianos in the score was the first and enduring indicator of just how bad House Arrest is going to get. The fact that it oh-so-self-consciously opens with Captain and Tenille's "Love Will Keep Us Together" -- and KEEPS PLAYING IT EVEN AFTER THAT STUPID KEY MODULATION -- is the final straw, and that's only about 4 minutes in. Happily, I love JLC and Jennifer Tilly (who had the only interesting part in the entire flick), as well as Wallace Shawn. But what was Wallace Shawn doing in this movie?? Bad concept, bad script, bad acting, bad characters, bad, bad, bad people raising more brats to perpetuate the badness of the suburbs. I wish they would have just f'n gotten divorced already. Then, we all could have sidestepped this exercise in vicarious misery, altogether. The ONLY thing that merited even a "1" was JLC doing a silly hula over the credits. Well, give it perhaps a 1 and a half. The relief brought by seeing the credits alone made this cranky critic very, very happy. Alright, a very begrudging 2. Jennifer Love Hewitt's singing voice on" It's Good to Know That I'm Alive" sounds sufficiently like the fantastic Maria McKee of Lone Justice to make me look. Who knew? Right on. I guess.

    HOUSE ARREST, in my opinion, is a very hilarious and touching comedy about how kids are affected when their parents announce they're going to separate. Anytime Ned (Kevin Pollak) and Katie (Jamie Lee Curtis) bickered, I felt really touched. It's hard for me to explain why. When Matt (Mooky Arizona), T.J. (Russel Harper), and Brooke (Jennifer Love Hewitt) decided to do what Grover (Kyle Howard) and Stacy (Amy Sakasitz) did, I really began to enjoy this film. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, "If you ask me, THE STORY OF US really shows you how kids can be affected by their parents announcing they're going to separate." Now, in conclusion, I recommend this very hilarious and touching comedy about how kids are affected when their parents announce they're going to separate to all you Kevin Pollak or Jamie Lee Curtis fans who have not seen it. You're in for some tears and a good time, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.

    The Calibre of the actors is not in question but what they did with the material was nothing short of a miracle. As Actors you have to make a living so please don't blame them, although I would say that the one that didn't fit was kevin pollack. He gave no reason for us to either empathise or sympathise with his character. Jennifer Tilly stole the show in this instance but I will have to admit Her daughter played by Jennifer Love Hewitt showed signs that her acting ability in comedic roles suits her better than he more serious roles she has been given. Admittedly she doesn't have a gutsy enough part for the film. In fact the characters were all too shallow to be taken seriously in any respect although the storyline was entertaining there is no real depth to it. The film needed more background to each of the families involved to succeed. As it happened the only redemption was Jenifer Tilly whom not seen until almost all the parents were kidnapped, made the best of a bad situation and became a catalyst for the the other characters to play off of. Verdict: Most of the actors made the best of a bad script. But not a bad film I felt the Director could have done better.

    It's true "House Arrest" did not do well in the critics' minds, and also did not do well at the box office, but the quality of a movie is not always easy to determine by either. We all know of movies which are either lauded by the critics, or do well at the box office, and we end up wondering why. You are the best critic in any case. One thing about "House Arrest" is that it has a good message. Not that locking your parents up will solve problems. That is a bad message, but consider the song at the end of the movie "Do What You Gotta Do For Love". It opens with the line "Change the world". We all have in our power the ability to change the world. Nobody can solve all the worlds' problems. Even if you have the money of Bill Gates, or the power of President Bush (and a lot of problems can't be solved by either), you can't Jove every problem, but there are ones you can solve, so we all need to focus in on them. The world has thousands of problems. It requires thousands of solutions, and thousands of different people. Sometimes, a better world starts with voting carefully. One thing, what has become of Mooky Arizona. I liked him in "House Arrest". What is he doing now. You can email me at bfithern@yahoo.co.uk

    No matter how you beat around the bush this movie is still a good movie. Even though at times it can be sappy, like when Grover has his temper tantrum (which was absolutely funny) its still cute. My favorite part would have to be when the parents are dancing, it was so cute. But then you want to wonder what was going on with Mark's folks I mean at one point I was trying to understand why they were looking like they had sex the that night. When TJ started playing " Its Not Unusual" you see their heads pop out. Why would they be having sex when other people were around, thats kind of weird. Another thing it was kind of grimy how the fist thing that Mrs. Beindorf notices about her husband is his car. what was up with the nosy behind neighbor? These scenes really made you really want to go "hmmmmmm"? I love the part when Mr. Beindorf tells his wife that Mr. Krump would be his attorney. Krump looks at the wife and turns to Beindorf and say " I can get you the house, but kids might be a problem" All in all this movie is still good.

    This film has quite possibly one of the most unrealistic premises on the face of the earth. Two kids lock up their parents in the basement and when other kids hear of it they too lock their parents in the same basement. Stupid. The film is rancid with clich&eacute;s of the worst kind. For example the main kid is picked on unmercifully by a bully who then becomes a good friend or the neighbor who thinks of himself as the mayor interferes with the kids' plan. The thing that bugs me the most is the kids, after kidnapping their parents, spend one count 'em one day in juvenile hall and then get off Scot free. In fact two of them get to go to Hawaii. The police in the film are as unrealistic as a car with wings. Nevertheless I find myself continuing to watch it when it comes on TV. It's entertaining at best. I give it ** out of ****

    This comedy, about a teenager and his younger sister who lock their parents in the basement until they work out their marital problems, is not as bad as it sounds. We wind up with a bunch of kids upstairs who know how to relate to one another but gradually have to work out how to keep practical things running, and a bunch of adults downstairs who are just the opposite. In truth, neither side does very well, but at least this is not the tired condescension of the kids screwing up and needing to be rescued by the adults: both groups are portrayed with a mix of severity and sympathy. Throw in a meddling retired chief of police across the street, and make him Ray Walston whom I think everybody loved most in "Picket Fences," and you have a film that is very entertaining, and also carries across some deeper meaning about what contributions young people and older ones can make to each other's ongoing development. Kyle Howard was 18 trying to play 14, which took a good deal of suspension of disbelief, but that miscasting seems to be an obsession Hollywood just can't seem to grow out of.

    'House Arrest' is a really cute movie and hopefully will influence parents to think about things before just getting a divorce. This movie may not be the most realistic portrayal of how a kid would act when he found out his parents were thinking about splitting (ie locking your parents in the basement) but the reactions are pretty genuine in the fact that just about all kids have problems with their parents. Some things were def. over-exaggerated though, like when Grover (Kyle Howard) finds divorce papers in the mail and then 'flips' out by shoving a bunch of papers around and knocking stuff over. No kid, well usually, would be that mad about their parents divorcing (I'm sure they would be upset, maybe cry, but like wrecking stuff in some sort of manner, yea right). The acting wasn't bad, I thought it was pretty good all around. The story was funny and if your parents aren't like any of the ones in the movie, you probably will appreciate your own family more. I recommend seeing this if you can, it's on HBO a lot.

    House Arrest is one of the only movies I can remember from when I was younger. The thing that stands out most in my mind is the songs (soundtrack). It really complimented the story, which was very funny and thoughtful, and made the whole experience worthwhile. The main character, Grover, is a picturesque hero... always trying so hard to do what he thinks is right, and not always successful. Grover's parents and little sister are people that I think a majority of us viewers can relate to. Every family has problems, and the way that those problems are addressed in this movie is unique and memorable. All of the quirky characters really make this movie a delightful experience. I would recommend it to anyone, its a wholesome good time.

    These people's awful kids included. Just to be clear on where I'm coming from, I booed when Janet and Ned sucked face at the end. And that stupid, stupidstupidstupid Brooke-Grover clich&eacute;, come on. I hate movies set in the suburbs because I despise the suburbs. I hate movies about screeching, arguing, suburban married people who hate each other, because I hate screeching suburban married conventionalist dumbasses who hate each other. House Arrest was a 90 minute reminder of why I don't understand and ultimately don't care why these types of people marry each other, and hope they ALL get divorced and give the world some much needed peace. So I guess we're back to Carmenjonze's First Law of Unwatchable Movies...a telling overabundance of violins, flutes and pianos in the score was the first and enduring indicator of just how bad House Arrest is going to get. The fact that it oh-so-self-consciously opens with Captain and Tenille's "Love Will Keep Us Together" -- and KEEPS PLAYING IT EVEN AFTER THAT STUPID KEY MODULATION -- is the final straw, and that's only about 4 minutes in. Happily, I love JLC and Jennifer Tilly (who had the only interesting part in the entire flick), as well as Wallace Shawn. But what was Wallace Shawn doing in this movie?? Bad concept, bad script, bad acting, bad characters, bad, bad, bad people raising more brats to perpetuate the badness of the suburbs. I wish they would have just f'n gotten divorced already. Then, we all could have sidestepped this exercise in vicarious misery, altogether. The ONLY thing that merited even a "1" was JLC doing a silly hula over the credits. Well, give it perhaps a 1 and a half. The relief brought by seeing the credits alone made this cranky critic very, very happy. Alright, a very begrudging 2. Jennifer Love Hewitt's singing voice on" It's Good to Know That I'm Alive" sounds sufficiently like the fantastic Maria McKee of Lone Justice to make me look. Who knew? Right on. I guess.

    HOUSE ARREST, in my opinion, is a very hilarious and touching comedy about how kids are affected when their parents announce they're going to separate. Anytime Ned (Kevin Pollak) and Katie (Jamie Lee Curtis) bickered, I felt really touched. It's hard for me to explain why. When Matt (Mooky Arizona), T.J. (Russel Harper), and Brooke (Jennifer Love Hewitt) decided to do what Grover (Kyle Howard) and Stacy (Amy Sakasitz) did, I really began to enjoy this film. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, "If you ask me, THE STORY OF US really shows you how kids can be affected by their parents announcing they're going to separate." Now, in conclusion, I recommend this very hilarious and touching comedy about how kids are affected when their parents announce they're going to separate to all you Kevin Pollak or Jamie Lee Curtis fans who have not seen it. You're in for some tears and a good time, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.

    The Calibre of the actors is not in question but what they did with the material was nothing short of a miracle. As Actors you have to make a living so please don't blame them, although I would say that the one that didn't fit was kevin pollack. He gave no reason for us to either empathise or sympathise with his character. Jennifer Tilly stole the show in this instance but I will have to admit Her daughter played by Jennifer Love Hewitt showed signs that her acting ability in comedic roles suits her better than he more serious roles she has been given. Admittedly she doesn't have a gutsy enough part for the film. In fact the characters were all too shallow to be taken seriously in any respect although the storyline was entertaining there is no real depth to it. The film needed more background to each of the families involved to succeed. As it happened the only redemption was Jenifer Tilly whom not seen until almost all the parents were kidnapped, made the best of a bad situation and became a catalyst for the the other characters to play off of. Verdict: Most of the actors made the best of a bad script. But not a bad film I felt the Director could have done better.

    It's true "House Arrest" did not do well in the critics' minds, and also did not do well at the box office, but the quality of a movie is not always easy to determine by either. We all know of movies which are either lauded by the critics, or do well at the box office, and we end up wondering why. You are the best critic in any case. One thing about "House Arrest" is that it has a good message. Not that locking your parents up will solve problems. That is a bad message, but consider the song at the end of the movie "Do What You Gotta Do For Love". It opens with the line "Change the world". We all have in our power the ability to change the world. Nobody can solve all the worlds' problems. Even if you have the money of Bill Gates, or the power of President Bush (and a lot of problems can't be solved by either), you can't Jove every problem, but there are ones you can solve, so we all need to focus in on them. The world has thousands of problems. It requires thousands of solutions, and thousands of different people. Sometimes, a better world starts with voting carefully. One thing, what has become of Mooky Arizona. I liked him in "House Arrest". What is he doing now. You can email me at bfithern@yahoo.co.uk
