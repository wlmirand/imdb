 <sinopse>
  In the far future, a highly sexual woman is tasked with finding and stopping the evil Durand-Durand. Along the way she encounters various unusual people.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  After an in-flight anti-gravity striptease (masked by the film's opening titles), Barbarella, a 41st century astronaut, lands on the planet Lythion and sets out to find the evil Durand Durand in the city of Sogo, where a new sin is invented every hour. There, she encounters such objects as the Exessive Machine, a genuine sex organ on which an accomplished artist of the keyboard, in this case, Durand Durand himself, can drive a victim to death by pleasure, a lesbian queen who, in her dream chamber, can make her fantasies take form, and a group of ladies smoking a giant hookah which, via a poor victim struggling in its glass globe, dispenses Essance of Man. You can't help but be impressed by the special effects crew and the various ways that were found to tear off what few clothes our heroine seemed to possess. Based on the popular French comic strip.

    I would rather eat all of the vomit off of all of the sidewalks in all of Russia every single day for the rest of my natural life than see a single frame of this film again. I didn't like it. I can not think of another film which is less enjoyable. It is so stupid that it ought to be funny, but in fact it is just disgustingly boring and up its own rectum. Whoever made it should be boiled in a cauldron for a year and the resulting sludge and bones be ground into a fine paste, fed to rats, the rats microwaved for a thousand minutes on high, thrown out the window, devoured by maggots, the maggots drowned in gasoline, this set on fire, and burned until all that remains is a tiny little patch of carbon on the porch which should then be meticulously removed, parceled into a die-cast aluminum capsule, and shot into space. Thank you.

    In the far future, a highly sexual woman (Jane Fonda) is tasked with finding and stopping the evil Durand-Durand. Along the way she encounters various unusual people. What to say about this film? The only thing it can really be compared to is the "Flash Gordon" movie that came out much later. So, I guess if you like that film you have to give some level of respect to this one. I hardly know what to say... it is camp, it is kitsch, it is all that made the 1960s what it was. Some of it is just strange or bordering on exploitation. Other parts are a bit more clever. The idea of the music massage machine is rather clever, even if it went in a strange direction of part-sexuality and part-torture.

    Comic Strip brought appropriately to life . Tremendous fun, amusing scenes , psychedelic frames and many other things . In the far future, the year is 40,000. The protagonist is a highly sexual woman named Barbarella (Jane Fonda , Sophia Loren turned down the title role) is tasked with finding and stopping the evil Durand-Durand (character famously inspired the band name of 1980s pop stars Duran Duran), a missing scientist (Milo O'Shea). Along the quite sexy way she encounters various unusual people . As Barbarella (whose costume was inspired by designer Paco Rabanne) travels to the evil city called SoGo, it is a reference to Biblical cities Sodom and Gomorrah. On her dangerous trip she teams with blind angel Pygar (John Philip Law), and fights the Great Tyrant (Anita Pallenberg) along with numerous sexual torture devices , but she has to save the world . Naif Sci-Fi plenty of colors , thrills , brilliant cinematography by Claude Renoir and fantastic images ; surprisingly, for such a diverse melange, it actually works. Knowingly Camp version of comic-book sci-Fi classic written by Jean Claude Forest . In the original comic, Barbarella was not a secret agent but an outlaw, and the movie omits some of the adventures she had on Lythion, including an encounter with an earlier villainess called the Gorgon, whose face changed into a duplicate of the face of anyone who looked at her. Unlike the other space movies of the time, this film emphasized sets and costumes rather than visual effects, and as a result its overall look dates less than many space operas of the late seventies/early eighties .Jane Fonda is simply unbelievable as gorgeous heroine , she plays a feisty Barbarella , a futuristic girl from Earth . The scenes during the opening credits where Barbarella seems to float around her spaceship were filmed by having Jane Fonda lie on a huge piece of plexiglas with a picture of the spaceship underneath her. It was then filmed from above, creating the illusion that she is in zero gravity. Performance-wise, everyone seems to be camping it up like an end-of-term pantomime, though Milo O'Shea somehow seems to give his villain a deliciously style . Barbarella was the first science fiction hero from the comics to be adapted into a feature film as opposed to a serial , Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers, her male predecessors, had only appeared in serials up to this point. A bit later on , there was realized by Mike Hodges &uml;Flash Gordon&uml; (1980) in similar aesthetic and a TV series titled &uml;Buck Rogers&uml; . Jolly and catching musical score , including commercial songs , by Charles Fox, who co-wrote the songs for this film, also wrote the theme song for another Sci/Fi flick of 1968, The Green Slime, and future Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour was one of the session musicians who performed the film's original score. The motion picture was originally directed by Roger Vadim who married Brigitte Bardot , in fact , the original author Jean-Claude Forest based the character of Barbarella on Brigitte Bardot - who ironically was director Roger Vadim's previous wife ; Vadim subsequently married Jane Fonda . However this film is listed among The 100 Most Amusingly Bad Movies Ever Made in Golden Raspberry Award .

    The plot isn't very important: it's a farcical sci-fi odyssey full of deus ex machina in which a ditzy Jane Fonda saves the universe. The acting, plot, and dialog are all cheesy and superficial, but behind that is something legitimately engaging, worthy, even wondrous. Barabarella *is* creative and has an abundance of striking images that--by virtue of weirdness, ridiculousness, creepiness, or sexiness--will stick with you if you are paying attention. The effects are massively low budget by today's standards: it's more like you're watching a stage play than a film. But this stage play has scenery, costumes, and props that are often really gorgeous and interesting. You'll see hedonists smoking "essence of man" in the City of Night, the priests and architecture of that city, bizarre and disconcerting carnivorous dolls, the Excessive Machine and its hall scattered with the remains of ladies, and the psychedelic Chamber of Dreams. The movie has plenty of interesting concepts too, for which the comic is largely to thank. They are cheesily executed but still thought- provoking. The future has replaced physical sex with some weird psychic act. The galaxy is so peaceful that the only way to combat a terrorist is to dust off weapons found in an old museum. And we see a switcheroo on heaven and hell where the evil are exalted in the beautiful city and the good are exiled to wander around a bleary labyrinth. All of these things are wondrous to see. You just need a coping mechanism to deal with the fact that the dialogue is ridiculous and the acting is often lame--even Marcel Marceau. I found that I could just suspend judgement and go along for the ride. Maybe you can, zen-like, just ignore the embarrassment of it of it all. It's worth it. Did I mention that it's cheesy as hell? But this film is also sexy, fun, creepy, strange, gorgeous, and intriguing. Best watched horny and intoxicated on something or the other. You'll have a blast.

    Barbarella (1968) ** (out of 4) Campy sci-fi based on the French comics has Jane Fonda playing the title role, a futuristic superhero who is asked by the President of Earth to travel to a distant planet and rescue a doctor. I can understand why this film has gained a cult following over the past few decades but to me this thing is still a pretty big mess and it's somewhat shocking watching the film to day and looking back and wondering what the original producers were thinking. I mean, if you look at the "story" of this thing, it's a complete mess and it's all over the place. I'm not exactly sure what they were trying to do in regards to the story but it's a complete misfire. Not for a single second do you care about Barbarella's adventure nor do you care about anything she's doing in the film. The reason the film remains entertaining is because it's simply so strange and surreal. Visually the film is quite impressive as a bunch of pulp. The set design and costumes are certainly memorable and the now laughable special effects have a mild charm to them. What really keeps the film moving is seeing someone like Fonda doing a role like this. She's very good in the role, there's no doubt about it, as she can handle the campy moments as well as deliver on the sexuality of the character. Her nude striptease that starts the film is certainly the highlight but they needed more of these throughout. John Phillip Law isn't all that "good" in the film but there's no question that his angel character is quite memorable. Director Roger Vadim doesn't bring enough life, energy or fire to any of the scenes to really make them work and that's certainly not good when you're dealing with a film like this one. BARBARELLA certainly deserves its label as a camp classic but it's just not entertaining enough to be fully rewarding.

    "Barbarella" is clearly not a very good film. The dialog and writing are dumb and much of the acting is dopey. However, I am sure it has a group of loyal followers, as there is a cheesy badness and sexiness that is pretty infectious. It looks in many ways like a sci-fi sex film made by a group of 13 year-olds--13 year-olds with an incredible sense of set design! It's so strange and silly that it's worth seeing at least once--but you might not want others to know you watched it, as their opinions about your taste might be seriously compromised! The film begins with the opening credits--and A LOT of Barbarella, as she appears to float naked in her space ship. For 2012, it's relatively tame but for 1968, it was a VERY hot scene--as are many throughout the film. Today, it might not even be seen as mild porn--more like a mild R-rated film. But, in 1968, it was mega-hot--but still quite silly! Barbarella is instructed by the President of Earth to look for Duran-Duran (also called 'Durand-Durand') and return him to Earth. Along the way, Barbarella has lots of adventures--most of which result in her losing her clothes and/or having sex. Some of the adventures do not--such as the group of crazed kids with flesh-eating dolls--but most everyone (men and women) else seems to want Barbarella and her body. A few of the weird things to look for are the blue bunnies, seeing Marcel Marceau in a SPEAKING role, killer budgies and a killer sex machine! As I said...the sort of stuff teenagers would probably find funny and stimulating! The ending is pretty dumb, but the way--and very anti-climactic. Overall, it's an amazingly stupid film that you can't help but watch because it's so silly and has such super-awesome bizarre sets and costumes (sort of like the products of the top designers of the day if they were on LSD). You just have to see this to believe it...and you still probably won't!

    Scouring the video store shelves in search of something interesting I feel like I should see often yields surprising results, but I wasn't quite prepared for the surprise I got from BARBARELLA: QUEEN OF THE GALAXY. I had a vague idea of what it was (kitschy sci-fi cult classic was my understanding), but, to my initial delight (but eventual disappointment), I had more in store, but perhaps also much, much less. BARBARELLA is a bizarre, psychedelic tale of the sexual awakening of the titular (no pun intended) character, played by an startlingly young and alluring Jane Fonda, a woman sent by the Government of the Republic of Earth to search for scientist Durand Durand. Durand, whose spacecraft disappeared somewhere near mysterious planet Tau Ceti, is the creator of the Positronic Ray, a weapon of unspeakable power which the Earth government wish to retrieve before it falls into unfriendly hands. After crash landing on the planet, Barbarella encounters various odd people and creatures, all of whom seem to exist in a primitive world of sexual liberation. 41st century society has moved on from archaic penetrative intercourse it seems, opting instead for a meditative melding of 'psychocardiograms' (think the virtual sex from DEMOLITION MAN, but less exciting), and Barbarella is initially appalled at the idea, yet after around 20 seconds of coercion from a creep in a bear suit, experiences the pleasures of the flesh for the first time. And so begins the erotic adventures of Barbarella, which include making love to a blind angel, being propositioned by a one-eyed dominatrix who may not be what she seems, and having her body literally played like an organ by the nefarious Durand Durand. Unfortunately, it all sounds a little racier than it is. There's plenty of innuendo and double entendre (one of the characters is named Dildano!), but really it's not pushed far enough, and the film is a little tame. There are laughs to be had, and Fonda is fully committed to the campy lunacy of the script but BARBARELLA doesn't really live up to its cult status. The spectacularly low-budget sets and effects, Fonda's ever-changing and increasingly revealing outfits, and the fun and funky psychedelic lounge music throughout stand out as highlight, but it's far from a good movie. Amazingly Fonda turned down both BONNIE AND CLYDE and ROSEMARY'S BABY to make this, so I guess you have to give her credit for the effort, and perhaps some chemical accompaniment would work in BARBARELLA's favour (as I'm certain there was plenty on set). It's the sort of film which you know you're going to like or hate before even starting it, and I'm not surprised that it has its fans. Unfortunately, I'm not one of them. tinribs27.wordpress.com

    ...she doesn't really do anything. Rather than create the ground breaking heroine they could have, Vadim and his all-too-male crew go for the easy option by portraying the character as not much more than a deceptively dull Barbie-doll figure. She moves from one situation to the next like a wide-eyed tourist, barely taking part in the proceedings, let alone actually causing things to happen. I don't think she solves a single problem in the entire movie. Not with her mind anyway. This is a cardinal sin in film making: creating a lead character who is NOT proactive. Female viewers might be disappointed that the promise of a feisty, sexually confident, independently minded action heroine is only partly fulfilled. Yes, the character is sexually confident, but even that is at the service of the male characters in the film. As for the rest, forget it. Pity. The film makers should have looked to Emma Peel/Kathy Gale from The Avengers for a model of how Barbarella could have worked. On the upside, the movie looks great - terrific psychedelic designs and sets. Good fun for the eye. However, while individual static shots are well composed, Vadim doesn't do much with camera movement, so the film isn't as graceful as it could be. He doesn't seem to know much about pacing either - the internal rhythm of the movie is a little bit off which adds to the unsatisfying feel of the whole thing. The cast is fine. Fonda, an otherwise superb actress, does her best with a non-character. She hints at the intelligent, resourceful character Barbarella might have been if the script had been on her side. Milo Oshea is great as the mad scientist, and David Hemmings is fun, if a little wasted, in what amounts to an extended cameo. In summary, a hoot for fans of super-camp kitsch cinema, and a bit of a male sex-fantasy for undiscerning 14 year old boys of all ages, but otherwise, and from the viewpoint of modern grown-up audiences, just an hour and a half of tiresomely sexist trash. Ironically, if Vadim and Co. had retained the sexiness of Barbarella's character but boosted her IQ and resourcefulness then the film might be enjoying a far greater reputation than it currently does. It wouldn't have taken much effort, but they blew it.

    According to my summary... you obviously tought that I have watched it in a porn-like manner. No! Actually, this lovely baby is one cool film! Based up comic book from 1962 and it's really faithful to it, and I am glad because of it. The plot is concentrated on adventures of young sexy heroine Barbarella (Jane Fonda) and her mission to planet Lythion, in the city of Sogo to find a dangerous scientist. I think that Roger Vadim is using a classic luxury from the "space opera" for those grotesque and travesty like situations (for example... cannibal dolls! Cool!) There's constantly this erotic charge in Jane Fonda, which is half-naked or in sexy clothes through entire film. But sometimes there's just too much grotesque on expense of SF components. I think that Vadim did it on purpose and he gave us one rare SF comedy in 60s. But, the entire stuff is too silly. Like you are watching "Rocky Horror Show". Fonda is a great actress, not just sexy, John Philip Law as Pygar, he was great! Anita Pallenberg (Great Tyrant), an exotic sexy rival to Fonda, Milo O'Shea and Marcel Marceau were also great and to mention David Hemmings. A highly recommended must see film. Watch it!

    If you watched the 1980 version of Flash Gordon and thought it was a bit too camp then Barbarella is not the film for you as it makes Flash Gordon look positively restrained! Set in the far future our eponymous heroine is sent on a mission by the President of Earth to find the scientist Durand Durand. He has invented the positronic ray; a weapon that threatens the peace that now exists throughout most of the universe. She heads to the planet where he was last seen but crash-lands. She soon learns that this is a far from safe place although there are some people who are willing to help her on her mission including an angel! Her mission will take her to a city ruled over by an evil tyrant who would happily have Barbarella killed but if she wants to complete her mission she will have to confront her. While this film is a camp classic it has plenty of flaws; much of the acting isn't great, the story is okay at best and the special effects have dated badly. Luckily Jane Fonda is delightful in the title roll managing to bring the necessary innocence to her roll even though she is almost always wearing fairly revealing clothes apart from in the famous opening sequence when she strips down from wearing a space suit to wearing nothing at all! Even that is fairly innocent by today's standards with the credits protecting her modesty most but not quite all of the time. If you like your sci-fi camp then this is a must see otherwise it is more of a curiosity from a more innocent age; sex is referred to but happens off camera, there is no swearing and nudity is limited to a very brief glimpse of Jane Fonda's breasts and backside so it shouldn't offend too many adult viewers.

    Barbarella (1968) ** (out of 4) Campy sci-fi based on the French comics has Jane Fonda playing the title role, a futuristic superhero who is asked by the President of Earth to travel to a distant planet and rescue a doctor. I can understand why this film has gained a cult following over the past few decades but to me this thing is still a pretty big mess and it's somewhat shocking watching the film to day and looking back and wondering what the original producers were thinking. I mean, if you look at the "story" of this thing, it's a complete mess and it's all over the place. I'm not exactly sure what they were trying to do in regards to the story but it's a complete misfire. Not for a single second do you care about Barbarella's adventure nor do you care about anything she's doing in the film. The reason the film remains entertaining is because it's simply so strange and surreal. Visually the film is quite impressive as a bunch of pulp. The set design and costumes are certainly memorable and the now laughable special effects have a mild charm to them. What really keeps the film moving is seeing someone like Fonda doing a role like this. She's very good in the role, there's no doubt about it, as she can handle the campy moments as well as deliver on the sexuality of the character. Her nude striptease that starts the film is certainly the highlight but they needed more of these throughout. John Phillip Law isn't all that "good" in the film but there's no question that his angel character is quite memorable. Director Roger Vadim doesn't bring enough life, energy or fire to any of the scenes to really make them work and that's certainly not good when you're dealing with a film like this one. BARBARELLA certainly deserves its label as a camp classic but it's just not entertaining enough to be fully rewarding.

    "Barbarella" is clearly not a very good film. The dialog and writing are dumb and much of the acting is dopey. However, I am sure it has a group of loyal followers, as there is a cheesy badness and sexiness that is pretty infectious. It looks in many ways like a sci-fi sex film made by a group of 13 year-olds--13 year-olds with an incredible sense of set design! It's so strange and silly that it's worth seeing at least once--but you might not want others to know you watched it, as their opinions about your taste might be seriously compromised! The film begins with the opening credits--and A LOT of Barbarella, as she appears to float naked in her space ship. For 2012, it's relatively tame but for 1968, it was a VERY hot scene--as are many throughout the film. Today, it might not even be seen as mild porn--more like a mild R-rated film. But, in 1968, it was mega-hot--but still quite silly! Barbarella is instructed by the President of Earth to look for Duran-Duran (also called 'Durand-Durand') and return him to Earth. Along the way, Barbarella has lots of adventures--most of which result in her losing her clothes and/or having sex. Some of the adventures do not--such as the group of crazed kids with flesh-eating dolls--but most everyone (men and women) else seems to want Barbarella and her body. A few of the weird things to look for are the blue bunnies, seeing Marcel Marceau in a SPEAKING role, killer budgies and a killer sex machine! As I said...the sort of stuff teenagers would probably find funny and stimulating! The ending is pretty dumb, but the way--and very anti-climactic. Overall, it's an amazingly stupid film that you can't help but watch because it's so silly and has such super-awesome bizarre sets and costumes (sort of like the products of the top designers of the day if they were on LSD). You just have to see this to believe it...and you still probably won't!

    Scouring the video store shelves in search of something interesting I feel like I should see often yields surprising results, but I wasn't quite prepared for the surprise I got from BARBARELLA: QUEEN OF THE GALAXY. I had a vague idea of what it was (kitschy sci-fi cult classic was my understanding), but, to my initial delight (but eventual disappointment), I had more in store, but perhaps also much, much less. BARBARELLA is a bizarre, psychedelic tale of the sexual awakening of the titular (no pun intended) character, played by an startlingly young and alluring Jane Fonda, a woman sent by the Government of the Republic of Earth to search for scientist Durand Durand. Durand, whose spacecraft disappeared somewhere near mysterious planet Tau Ceti, is the creator of the Positronic Ray, a weapon of unspeakable power which the Earth government wish to retrieve before it falls into unfriendly hands. After crash landing on the planet, Barbarella encounters various odd people and creatures, all of whom seem to exist in a primitive world of sexual liberation. 41st century society has moved on from archaic penetrative intercourse it seems, opting instead for a meditative melding of 'psychocardiograms' (think the virtual sex from DEMOLITION MAN, but less exciting), and Barbarella is initially appalled at the idea, yet after around 20 seconds of coercion from a creep in a bear suit, experiences the pleasures of the flesh for the first time. And so begins the erotic adventures of Barbarella, which include making love to a blind angel, being propositioned by a one-eyed dominatrix who may not be what she seems, and having her body literally played like an organ by the nefarious Durand Durand. Unfortunately, it all sounds a little racier than it is. There's plenty of innuendo and double entendre (one of the characters is named Dildano!), but really it's not pushed far enough, and the film is a little tame. There are laughs to be had, and Fonda is fully committed to the campy lunacy of the script but BARBARELLA doesn't really live up to its cult status. The spectacularly low-budget sets and effects, Fonda's ever-changing and increasingly revealing outfits, and the fun and funky psychedelic lounge music throughout stand out as highlight, but it's far from a good movie. Amazingly Fonda turned down both BONNIE AND CLYDE and ROSEMARY'S BABY to make this, so I guess you have to give her credit for the effort, and perhaps some chemical accompaniment would work in BARBARELLA's favour (as I'm certain there was plenty on set). It's the sort of film which you know you're going to like or hate before even starting it, and I'm not surprised that it has its fans. Unfortunately, I'm not one of them. tinribs27.wordpress.com

    ...she doesn't really do anything. Rather than create the ground breaking heroine they could have, Vadim and his all-too-male crew go for the easy option by portraying the character as not much more than a deceptively dull Barbie-doll figure. She moves from one situation to the next like a wide-eyed tourist, barely taking part in the proceedings, let alone actually causing things to happen. I don't think she solves a single problem in the entire movie. Not with her mind anyway. This is a cardinal sin in film making: creating a lead character who is NOT proactive. Female viewers might be disappointed that the promise of a feisty, sexually confident, independently minded action heroine is only partly fulfilled. Yes, the character is sexually confident, but even that is at the service of the male characters in the film. As for the rest, forget it. Pity. The film makers should have looked to Emma Peel/Kathy Gale from The Avengers for a model of how Barbarella could have worked. On the upside, the movie looks great - terrific psychedelic designs and sets. Good fun for the eye. However, while individual static shots are well composed, Vadim doesn't do much with camera movement, so the film isn't as graceful as it could be. He doesn't seem to know much about pacing either - the internal rhythm of the movie is a little bit off which adds to the unsatisfying feel of the whole thing. The cast is fine. Fonda, an otherwise superb actress, does her best with a non-character. She hints at the intelligent, resourceful character Barbarella might have been if the script had been on her side. Milo Oshea is great as the mad scientist, and David Hemmings is fun, if a little wasted, in what amounts to an extended cameo. In summary, a hoot for fans of super-camp kitsch cinema, and a bit of a male sex-fantasy for undiscerning 14 year old boys of all ages, but otherwise, and from the viewpoint of modern grown-up audiences, just an hour and a half of tiresomely sexist trash. Ironically, if Vadim and Co. had retained the sexiness of Barbarella's character but boosted her IQ and resourcefulness then the film might be enjoying a far greater reputation than it currently does. It wouldn't have taken much effort, but they blew it.

    According to my summary... you obviously tought that I have watched it in a porn-like manner. No! Actually, this lovely baby is one cool film! Based up comic book from 1962 and it's really faithful to it, and I am glad because of it. The plot is concentrated on adventures of young sexy heroine Barbarella (Jane Fonda) and her mission to planet Lythion, in the city of Sogo to find a dangerous scientist. I think that Roger Vadim is using a classic luxury from the "space opera" for those grotesque and travesty like situations (for example... cannibal dolls! Cool!) There's constantly this erotic charge in Jane Fonda, which is half-naked or in sexy clothes through entire film. But sometimes there's just too much grotesque on expense of SF components. I think that Vadim did it on purpose and he gave us one rare SF comedy in 60s. But, the entire stuff is too silly. Like you are watching "Rocky Horror Show". Fonda is a great actress, not just sexy, John Philip Law as Pygar, he was great! Anita Pallenberg (Great Tyrant), an exotic sexy rival to Fonda, Milo O'Shea and Marcel Marceau were also great and to mention David Hemmings. A highly recommended must see film. Watch it!

    If you watched the 1980 version of Flash Gordon and thought it was a bit too camp then Barbarella is not the film for you as it makes Flash Gordon look positively restrained! Set in the far future our eponymous heroine is sent on a mission by the President of Earth to find the scientist Durand Durand. He has invented the positronic ray; a weapon that threatens the peace that now exists throughout most of the universe. She heads to the planet where he was last seen but crash-lands. She soon learns that this is a far from safe place although there are some people who are willing to help her on her mission including an angel! Her mission will take her to a city ruled over by an evil tyrant who would happily have Barbarella killed but if she wants to complete her mission she will have to confront her. While this film is a camp classic it has plenty of flaws; much of the acting isn't great, the story is okay at best and the special effects have dated badly. Luckily Jane Fonda is delightful in the title roll managing to bring the necessary innocence to her roll even though she is almost always wearing fairly revealing clothes apart from in the famous opening sequence when she strips down from wearing a space suit to wearing nothing at all! Even that is fairly innocent by today's standards with the credits protecting her modesty most but not quite all of the time. If you like your sci-fi camp then this is a must see otherwise it is more of a curiosity from a more innocent age; sex is referred to but happens off camera, there is no swearing and nudity is limited to a very brief glimpse of Jane Fonda's breasts and backside so it shouldn't offend too many adult viewers.

    I would rather eat all of the vomit off of all of the sidewalks in all of Russia every single day for the rest of my natural life than see a single frame of this film again. I didn't like it. I can not think of another film which is less enjoyable. It is so stupid that it ought to be funny, but in fact it is just disgustingly boring and up its own rectum. Whoever made it should be boiled in a cauldron for a year and the resulting sludge and bones be ground into a fine paste, fed to rats, the rats microwaved for a thousand minutes on high, thrown out the window, devoured by maggots, the maggots drowned in gasoline, this set on fire, and burned until all that remains is a tiny little patch of carbon on the porch which should then be meticulously removed, parceled into a die-cast aluminum capsule, and shot into space. Thank you.

    In the far future, a highly sexual woman (Jane Fonda) is tasked with finding and stopping the evil Durand-Durand. Along the way she encounters various unusual people. What to say about this film? The only thing it can really be compared to is the "Flash Gordon" movie that came out much later. So, I guess if you like that film you have to give some level of respect to this one. I hardly know what to say... it is camp, it is kitsch, it is all that made the 1960s what it was. Some of it is just strange or bordering on exploitation. Other parts are a bit more clever. The idea of the music massage machine is rather clever, even if it went in a strange direction of part-sexuality and part-torture.

    Comic Strip brought appropriately to life . Tremendous fun, amusing scenes , psychedelic frames and many other things . In the far future, the year is 40,000. The protagonist is a highly sexual woman named Barbarella (Jane Fonda , Sophia Loren turned down the title role) is tasked with finding and stopping the evil Durand-Durand (character famously inspired the band name of 1980s pop stars Duran Duran), a missing scientist (Milo O'Shea). Along the quite sexy way she encounters various unusual people . As Barbarella (whose costume was inspired by designer Paco Rabanne) travels to the evil city called SoGo, it is a reference to Biblical cities Sodom and Gomorrah. On her dangerous trip she teams with blind angel Pygar (John Philip Law), and fights the Great Tyrant (Anita Pallenberg) along with numerous sexual torture devices , but she has to save the world . Naif Sci-Fi plenty of colors , thrills , brilliant cinematography by Claude Renoir and fantastic images ; surprisingly, for such a diverse melange, it actually works. Knowingly Camp version of comic-book sci-Fi classic written by Jean Claude Forest . In the original comic, Barbarella was not a secret agent but an outlaw, and the movie omits some of the adventures she had on Lythion, including an encounter with an earlier villainess called the Gorgon, whose face changed into a duplicate of the face of anyone who looked at her. Unlike the other space movies of the time, this film emphasized sets and costumes rather than visual effects, and as a result its overall look dates less than many space operas of the late seventies/early eighties .Jane Fonda is simply unbelievable as gorgeous heroine , she plays a feisty Barbarella , a futuristic girl from Earth . The scenes during the opening credits where Barbarella seems to float around her spaceship were filmed by having Jane Fonda lie on a huge piece of plexiglas with a picture of the spaceship underneath her. It was then filmed from above, creating the illusion that she is in zero gravity. Performance-wise, everyone seems to be camping it up like an end-of-term pantomime, though Milo O'Shea somehow seems to give his villain a deliciously style . Barbarella was the first science fiction hero from the comics to be adapted into a feature film as opposed to a serial , Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers, her male predecessors, had only appeared in serials up to this point. A bit later on , there was realized by Mike Hodges &uml;Flash Gordon&uml; (1980) in similar aesthetic and a TV series titled &uml;Buck Rogers&uml; . Jolly and catching musical score , including commercial songs , by Charles Fox, who co-wrote the songs for this film, also wrote the theme song for another Sci/Fi flick of 1968, The Green Slime, and future Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour was one of the session musicians who performed the film's original score. The motion picture was originally directed by Roger Vadim who married Brigitte Bardot , in fact , the original author Jean-Claude Forest based the character of Barbarella on Brigitte Bardot - who ironically was director Roger Vadim's previous wife ; Vadim subsequently married Jane Fonda . However this film is listed among The 100 Most Amusingly Bad Movies Ever Made in Golden Raspberry Award .

    The plot isn't very important: it's a farcical sci-fi odyssey full of deus ex machina in which a ditzy Jane Fonda saves the universe. The acting, plot, and dialog are all cheesy and superficial, but behind that is something legitimately engaging, worthy, even wondrous. Barabarella *is* creative and has an abundance of striking images that--by virtue of weirdness, ridiculousness, creepiness, or sexiness--will stick with you if you are paying attention. The effects are massively low budget by today's standards: it's more like you're watching a stage play than a film. But this stage play has scenery, costumes, and props that are often really gorgeous and interesting. You'll see hedonists smoking "essence of man" in the City of Night, the priests and architecture of that city, bizarre and disconcerting carnivorous dolls, the Excessive Machine and its hall scattered with the remains of ladies, and the psychedelic Chamber of Dreams. The movie has plenty of interesting concepts too, for which the comic is largely to thank. They are cheesily executed but still thought- provoking. The future has replaced physical sex with some weird psychic act. The galaxy is so peaceful that the only way to combat a terrorist is to dust off weapons found in an old museum. And we see a switcheroo on heaven and hell where the evil are exalted in the beautiful city and the good are exiled to wander around a bleary labyrinth. All of these things are wondrous to see. You just need a coping mechanism to deal with the fact that the dialogue is ridiculous and the acting is often lame--even Marcel Marceau. I found that I could just suspend judgement and go along for the ride. Maybe you can, zen-like, just ignore the embarrassment of it of it all. It's worth it. Did I mention that it's cheesy as hell? But this film is also sexy, fun, creepy, strange, gorgeous, and intriguing. Best watched horny and intoxicated on something or the other. You'll have a blast.

Anita Pallenberg (Great Tyrant), an exotic sexy rival to Fonda, Milo O'Shea and Marcel Marceau were also great and to mention David Hemmings. A highly recommended must see film. Watch it!

    If you watched the 1980 version of Flash Gordon and thought it was a bit too camp then Barbarella is not the film for you as it makes Flash Gordon look positively restrained! Set in the far future our eponymous heroine is sent on a mission by the President of Earth to find the scientist Durand Durand. He has invented the positronic ray; a weapon that threatens the peace that now exists throughout most of the universe. She heads to the planet where he was last seen but crash-lands. She soon learns that this is a far from safe place although there are some people who are willing to help her on her mission including an angel! Her mission will take her to a city ruled over by an evil tyrant who would happily have Barbarella killed but if she wants to complete her mission she will have to confront her. While this film is a camp classic it has plenty of flaws; much of the acting isn't great, the story is okay at best and the special effects have dated badly. Luckily Jane Fonda is delightful in the title roll managing to bring the necessary innocence to her roll even though she is almost always wearing fairly revealing clothes apart from in the famous opening sequence when she strips down from wearing a space suit to wearing nothing at all! Even that is fairly innocent by today's standards with the credits protecting her modesty most but not quite all of the time. If you like your sci-fi camp then this is a must see otherwise it is more of a curiosity from a more innocent age; sex is referred to but happens off camera, there is no swearing and nudity is limited to a very brief glimpse of Jane Fonda's breasts and backside so it shouldn't offend too many adult viewers.

    I would rather eat all of the vomit off of all of the sidewalks in all of Russia every single day for the rest of my natural life than see a single frame of this film again. I didn't like it. I can not think of another film which is less enjoyable. It is so stupid that it ought to be funny, but in fact it is just disgustingly boring and up its own rectum. Whoever made it should be boiled in a cauldron for a year and the resulting sludge and bones be ground into a fine paste, fed to rats, the rats microwaved for a thousand minutes on high, thrown out the window, devoured by maggots, the maggots drowned in gasoline, this set on fire, and burned until all that remains is a tiny little patch of carbon on the porch which should then be meticulously removed, parceled into a die-cast aluminum capsule, and shot into space. Thank you.

    In the far future, a highly sexual woman (Jane Fonda) is tasked with finding and stopping the evil Durand-Durand. Along the way she encounters various unusual people. What to say about this film? The only thing it can really be compared to is the "Flash Gordon" movie that came out much later. So, I guess if you like that film you have to give some level of respect to this one. I hardly know what to say... it is camp, it is kitsch, it is all that made the 1960s what it was. Some of it is just strange or bordering on exploitation. Other parts are a bit more clever. The idea of the music massage machine is rather clever, even if it went in a strange direction of part-sexuality and part-torture.

    Comic Strip brought appropriately to life . Tremendous fun, amusing scenes , psychedelic frames and many other things . In the far future, the year is 40,000. The protagonist is a highly sexual woman named Barbarella (Jane Fonda , Sophia Loren turned down the title role) is tasked with finding and stopping the evil Durand-Durand (character famously inspired the band name of 1980s pop stars Duran Duran), a missing scientist (Milo O'Shea). Along the quite sexy way she encounters various unusual people . As Barbarella (whose costume was inspired by designer Paco Rabanne) travels to the evil city called SoGo, it is a reference to Biblical cities Sodom and Gomorrah. On her dangerous trip she teams with blind angel Pygar (John Philip Law), and fights the Great Tyrant (Anita Pallenberg) along with numerous sexual torture devices , but she has to save the world . Naif Sci-Fi plenty of colors , thrills , brilliant cinematography by Claude Renoir and fantastic images ; surprisingly, for such a diverse melange, it actually works. Knowingly Camp version of comic-book sci-Fi classic written by Jean Claude Forest . In the original comic, Barbarella was not a secret agent but an outlaw, and the movie omits some of the adventures she had on Lythion, including an encounter with an earlier villainess called the Gorgon, whose face changed into a duplicate of the face of anyone who looked at her. Unlike the other space movies of the time, this film emphasized sets and costumes rather than visual effects, and as a result its overall look dates less than many space operas of the late seventies/early eighties .Jane Fonda is simply unbelievable as gorgeous heroine , she plays a feisty Barbarella , a futuristic girl from Earth . The scenes during the opening credits where Barbarella seems to float around her spaceship were filmed by having Jane Fonda lie on a huge piece of plexiglas with a picture of the spaceship underneath her. It was then filmed from above, creating the illusion that she is in zero gravity. Performance-wise, everyone seems to be camping it up like an end-of-term pantomime, though Milo O'Shea somehow seems to give his villain a deliciously style . Barbarella was the first science fiction hero from the comics to be adapted into a feature film as opposed to a serial , Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers, her male predecessors, had only appeared in serials up to this point. A bit later on , there was realized by Mike Hodges &uml;Flash Gordon&uml; (1980) in similar aesthetic and a TV series titled &uml;Buck Rogers&uml; . Jolly and catching musical score , including commercial songs , by Charles Fox, who co-wrote the songs for this film, also wrote the theme song for another Sci/Fi flick of 1968, The Green Slime, and future Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour was one of the session musicians who performed the film's original score. The motion picture was originally directed by Roger Vadim who married Brigitte Bardot , in fact , the original author Jean-Claude Forest based the character of Barbarella on Brigitte Bardot - who ironically was director Roger Vadim's previous wife ; Vadim subsequently married Jane Fonda . However this film is listed among The 100 Most Amusingly Bad Movies Ever Made in Golden Raspberry Award .

    The plot isn't very important: it's a farcical sci-fi odyssey full of deus ex machina in which a ditzy Jane Fonda saves the universe. The acting, plot, and dialog are all cheesy and superficial, but behind that is something legitimately engaging, worthy, even wondrous. Barabarella *is* creative and has an abundance of striking images that--by virtue of weirdness, ridiculousness, creepiness, or sexiness--will stick with you if you are paying attention. The effects are massively low budget by today's standards: it's more like you're watching a stage play than a film. But this stage play has scenery, costumes, and props that are often really gorgeous and interesting. You'll see hedonists smoking "essence of man" in the City of Night, the priests and architecture of that city, bizarre and disconcerting carnivorous dolls, the Excessive Machine and its hall scattered with the remains of ladies, and the psychedelic Chamber of Dreams. The movie has plenty of interesting concepts too, for which the comic is largely to thank. They are cheesily executed but still thought- provoking. The future has replaced physical sex with some weird psychic act. The galaxy is so peaceful that the only way to combat a terrorist is to dust off weapons found in an old museum. And we see a switcheroo on heaven and hell where the evil are exalted in the beautiful city and the good are exiled to wander around a bleary labyrinth. All of these things are wondrous to see. You just need a coping mechanism to deal with the fact that the dialogue is ridiculous and the acting is often lame--even Marcel Marceau. I found that I could just suspend judgement and go along for the ride. Maybe you can, zen-like, just ignore the embarrassment of it of it all. It's worth it. Did I mention that it's cheesy as hell? But this film is also sexy, fun, creepy, strange, gorgeous, and intriguing. Best watched horny and intoxicated on something or the other. You'll have a blast.

    Barbarella (1968) ** (out of 4) Campy sci-fi based on the French comics has Jane Fonda playing the title role, a futuristic superhero who is asked by the President of Earth to travel to a distant planet and rescue a doctor. I can understand why this film has gained a cult following over the past few decades but to me this thing is still a pretty big mess and it's somewhat shocking watching the film to day and looking back and wondering what the original producers were thinking. I mean, if you look at the "story" of this thing, it's a complete mess and it's all over the place. I'm not exactly sure what they were trying to do in regards to the story but it's a complete misfire. Not for a single second do you care about Barbarella's adventure nor do you care about anything she's doing in the film. The reason the film remains entertaining is because it's simply so strange and surreal. Visually the film is quite impressive as a bunch of pulp. The set design and costumes are certainly memorable and the now laughable special effects have a mild charm to them. What really keeps the film moving is seeing someone like Fonda doing a role like this. She's very good in the role, there's no doubt about it, as she can handle the campy moments as well as deliver on the sexuality of the character. Her nude striptease that starts the film is certainly the highlight but they needed more of these throughout. John Phillip Law isn't all that "good" in the film but there's no question that his angel character is quite memorable. Director Roger Vadim doesn't bring enough life, energy or fire to any of the scenes to really make them work and that's certainly not good when you're dealing with a film like this one. BARBARELLA certainly deserves its label as a camp classic but it's just not entertaining enough to be fully rewarding.

    "Barbarella" is clearly not a very good film. The dialog and writing are dumb and much of the acting is dopey. However, I am sure it has a group of loyal followers, as there is a cheesy badness and sexiness that is pretty infectious. It looks in many ways like a sci-fi sex film made by a group of 13 year-olds--13 year-olds with an incredible sense of set design! It's so strange and silly that it's worth seeing at least once--but you might not want others to know you watched it, as their opinions about your taste might be seriously compromised! The film begins with the opening credits--and A LOT of Barbarella, as she appears to float naked in her space ship. For 2012, it's relatively tame but for 1968, it was a VERY hot scene--as are many throughout the film. Today, it might not even be seen as mild porn--more like a mild R-rated film. But, in 1968, it was mega-hot--but still quite silly! Barbarella is instructed by the President of Earth to look for Duran-Duran (also called 'Durand-Durand') and return him to Earth. Along the way, Barbarella has lots of adventures--most of which result in her losing her clothes and/or having sex. Some of the adventures do not--such as the group of crazed kids with flesh-eating dolls--but most everyone (men and women) else seems to want Barbarella and her body. A few of the weird things to look for are the blue bunnies, seeing Marcel Marceau in a SPEAKING role, killer budgies and a killer sex machine! As I said...the sort of stuff teenagers would probably find funny and stimulating! The ending is pretty dumb, but the way--and very anti-climactic. Overall, it's an amazingly stupid film that you can't help but watch because it's so silly and has such super-awesome bizarre sets and costumes (sort of like the products of the top designers of the day if they were on LSD). You just have to see this to believe it...and you still probably won't!

    Scouring the video store shelves in search of something interesting I feel like I should see often yields surprising results, but I wasn't quite prepared for the surprise I got from BARBARELLA: QUEEN OF THE GALAXY. I had a vague idea of what it was (kitschy sci-fi cult classic was my understanding), but, to my initial delight (but eventual disappointment), I had more in store, but perhaps also much, much less. BARBARELLA is a bizarre, psychedelic tale of the sexual awakening of the titular (no pun intended) character, played by an startlingly young and alluring Jane Fonda, a woman sent by the Government of the Republic of Earth to search for scientist Durand Durand. Durand, whose spacecraft disappeared somewhere near mysterious planet Tau Ceti, is the creator of the Positronic Ray, a weapon of unspeakable power which the Earth government wish to retrieve before it falls into unfriendly hands. After crash landing on the planet, Barbarella encounters various odd people and creatures, all of whom seem to exist in a primitive world of sexual liberation. 41st century society has moved on from archaic penetrative intercourse it seems, opting instead for a meditative melding of 'psychocardiograms' (think the virtual sex from DEMOLITION MAN, but less exciting), and Barbarella is initially appalled at the idea, yet after around 20 seconds of coercion from a creep in a bear suit, experiences the pleasures of the flesh for the first time. And so begins the erotic adventures of Barbarella, which include making love to a blind angel, being propositioned by a one-eyed dominatrix who may not be what she seems, and having her body literally played like an organ by the nefarious Durand Durand. Unfortunately, it all sounds a little racier than it is. There's plenty of innuendo and double entendre (one of the characters is named Dildano!), but really it's not pushed far enough, and the film is a little tame. There are laughs to be had, and Fonda is fully committed to the campy lunacy of the script but BARBARELLA doesn't really live up to its cult status. The spectacularly low-budget sets and effects, Fonda's ever-changing and increasingly revealing outfits, and the fun and funky psychedelic lounge music throughout stand out as highlight, but it's far from a good movie. Amazingly Fonda turned down both BONNIE AND CLYDE and ROSEMARY'S BABY to make this, so I guess you have to give her credit for the effort, and perhaps some chemical accompaniment would work in BARBARELLA's favour (as I'm certain there was plenty on set). It's the sort of film which you know you're going to like or hate before even starting it, and I'm not surprised that it has its fans. Unfortunately, I'm not one of them. tinribs27.wordpress.com

    ...she doesn't really do anything. Rather than create the ground breaking heroine they could have, Vadim and his all-too-male crew go for the easy option by portraying the character as not much more than a deceptively dull Barbie-doll figure. She moves from one situation to the next like a wide-eyed tourist, barely taking part in the proceedings, let alone actually causing things to happen. I don't think she solves a single problem in the entire movie. Not with her mind anyway. This is a cardinal sin in film making: creating a lead character who is NOT proactive. Female viewers might be disappointed that the promise of a feisty, sexually confident, independently minded action heroine is only partly fulfilled. Yes, the character is sexually confident, but even that is at the service of the male characters in the film. As for the rest, forget it. Pity. The film makers should have looked to Emma Peel/Kathy Gale from The Avengers for a model of how Barbarella could have worked. On the upside, the movie looks great - terrific psychedelic designs and sets. Good fun for the eye. However, while individual static shots are well composed, Vadim doesn't do much with camera movement, so the film isn't as graceful as it could be. He doesn't seem to know much about pacing either - the internal rhythm of the movie is a little bit off which adds to the unsatisfying feel of the whole thing. The cast is fine. Fonda, an otherwise superb actress, does her best with a non-character. She hints at the intelligent, resourceful character Barbarella might have been if the script had been on her side. Milo Oshea is great as the mad scientist, and David Hemmings is fun, if a little wasted, in what amounts to an extended cameo. In summary, a hoot for fans of super-camp kitsch cinema, and a bit of a male sex-fantasy for undiscerning 14 year old boys of all ages, but otherwise, and from the viewpoint of modern grown-up audiences, just an hour and a half of tiresomely sexist trash. Ironically, if Vadim and Co. had retained the sexiness of Barbarella's character but boosted her IQ and resourcefulness then the film might be enjoying a far greater reputation than it currently does. It wouldn't have taken much effort, but they blew it.

    According to my summary... you obviously tought that I have watched it in a porn-like manner. No! Actually, this lovely baby is one cool film! Based up comic book from 1962 and it's really faithful to it, and I am glad because of it. The plot is concentrated on adventures of young sexy heroine Barbarella (Jane Fonda) and her mission to planet Lythion, in the city of Sogo to find a dangerous scientist. I think that Roger Vadim is using a classic luxury from the "space opera" for those grotesque and travesty like situations (for example... cannibal dolls! Cool!) There's constantly this erotic charge in Jane Fonda, which is half-naked or in sexy clothes through entire film. But sometimes there's just too much grotesque on expense of SF components. I think that Vadim did it on purpose and he gave us one rare SF comedy in 60s. But, the entire stuff is too silly. Like you are watching "Rocky Horror Show". Fonda is a great actress, not just sexy, John Philip Law as Pygar, he was great! Anita Pallenberg (Great Tyrant), an exotic sexy rival to Fonda, Milo O'Shea and Marcel Marceau were also great and to mention David Hemmings. A highly recommended must see film. Watch it!

I mean, if you look at the "story" of this thing, it's a complete mess and it's all over the place. I'm not exactly sure what they were trying to do in regards to the story but it's a complete misfire. Not for a single second do you care about Barbarella's adventure nor do you care about anything she's doing in the film. The reason the film remains entertaining is because it's simply so strange and surreal. Visually the film is quite impressive as a bunch of pulp. The set design and costumes are certainly memorable and the now laughable special effects have a mild charm to them. What really keeps the film moving is seeing someone like Fonda doing a role like this. She's very good in the role, there's no doubt about it, as she can handle the campy moments as well as deliver on the sexuality of the character. Her nude striptease that starts the film is certainly the highlight but they needed more of these throughout. John Phillip Law isn't all that "good" in the film but there's no question that his angel character is quite memorable. Director Roger Vadim doesn't bring enough life, energy or fire to any of the scenes to really make them work and that's certainly not good when you're dealing with a film like this one. BARBARELLA certainly deserves its label as a camp classic but it's just not entertaining enough to be fully rewarding.

    "Barbarella" is clearly not a very good film. The dialog and writing are dumb and much of the acting is dopey. However, I am sure it has a group of loyal followers, as there is a cheesy badness and sexiness that is pretty infectious. It looks in many ways like a sci-fi sex film made by a group of 13 year-olds--13 year-olds with an incredible sense of set design! It's so strange and silly that it's worth seeing at least once--but you might not want others to know you watched it, as their opinions about your taste might be seriously compromised! The film begins with the opening credits--and A LOT of Barbarella, as she appears to float naked in her space ship. For 2012, it's relatively tame but for 1968, it was a VERY hot scene--as are many throughout the film. Today, it might not even be seen as mild porn--more like a mild R-rated film. But, in 1968, it was mega-hot--but still quite silly! Barbarella is instructed by the President of Earth to look for Duran-Duran (also called 'Durand-Durand') and return him to Earth. Along the way, Barbarella has lots of adventures--most of which result in her losing her clothes and/or having sex. Some of the adventures do not--such as the group of crazed kids with flesh-eating dolls--but most everyone (men and women) else seems to want Barbarella and her body. A few of the weird things to look for are the blue bunnies, seeing Marcel Marceau in a SPEAKING role, killer budgies and a killer sex machine! As I said...the sort of stuff teenagers would probably find funny and stimulating! The ending is pretty dumb, but the way--and very anti-climactic. Overall, it's an amazingly stupid film that you can't help but watch because it's so silly and has such super-awesome bizarre sets and costumes (sort of like the products of the top designers of the day if they were on LSD). You just have to see this to believe it...and you still probably won't!

    Scouring the video store shelves in search of something interesting I feel like I should see often yields surprising results, but I wasn't quite prepared for the surprise I got from BARBARELLA: QUEEN OF THE GALAXY. I had a vague idea of what it was (kitschy sci-fi cult classic was my understanding), but, to my initial delight (but eventual disappointment), I had more in store, but perhaps also much, much less. BARBARELLA is a bizarre, psychedelic tale of the sexual awakening of the titular (no pun intended) character, played by an startlingly young and alluring Jane Fonda, a woman sent by the Government of the Republic of Earth to search for scientist Durand Durand. Durand, whose spacecraft disappeared somewhere near mysterious planet Tau Ceti, is the creator of the Positronic Ray, a weapon of unspeakable power which the Earth government wish to retrieve before it falls into unfriendly hands. After crash landing on the planet, Barbarella encounters various odd people and creatures, all of whom seem to exist in a primitive world of sexual liberation. 41st century society has moved on from archaic penetrative intercourse it seems, opting instead for a meditative melding of 'psychocardiograms' (think the virtual sex from DEMOLITION MAN, but less exciting), and Barbarella is initially appalled at the idea, yet after around 20 seconds of coercion from a creep in a bear suit, experiences the pleasures of the flesh for the first time. And so begins the erotic adventures of Barbarella, which include making love to a blind angel, being propositioned by a one-eyed dominatrix who may not be what she seems, and having her body literally played like an organ by the nefarious Durand Durand. Unfortunately, it all sounds a little racier than it is. There's plenty of innuendo and double entendre (one of the characters is named Dildano!), but really it's not pushed far enough, and the film is a little tame. There are laughs to be had, and Fonda is fully committed to the campy lunacy of the script but BARBARELLA doesn't really live up to its cult status. The spectacularly low-budget sets and effects, Fonda's ever-changing and increasingly revealing outfits, and the fun and funky psychedelic lounge music throughout stand out as highlight, but it's far from a good movie. Amazingly Fonda turned down both BONNIE AND CLYDE and ROSEMARY'S BABY to make this, so I guess you have to give her credit for the effort, and perhaps some chemical accompaniment would work in BARBARELLA's favour (as I'm certain there was plenty on set). It's the sort of film which you know you're going to like or hate before even starting it, and I'm not surprised that it has its fans. Unfortunately, I'm not one of them. tinribs27.wordpress.com

    ...she doesn't really do anything. Rather than create the ground breaking heroine they could have, Vadim and his all-too-male crew go for the easy option by portraying the character as not much more than a deceptively dull Barbie-doll figure. She moves from one situation to the next like a wide-eyed tourist, barely taking part in the proceedings, let alone actually causing things to happen. I don't think she solves a single problem in the entire movie. Not with her mind anyway. This is a cardinal sin in film making: creating a lead character who is NOT proactive. Female viewers might be disappointed that the promise of a feisty, sexually confident, independently minded action heroine is only partly fulfilled. Yes, the character is sexually confident, but even that is at the service of the male characters in the film. As for the rest, forget it. Pity. The film makers should have looked to Emma Peel/Kathy Gale from The Avengers for a model of how Barbarella could have worked. On the upside, the movie looks great - terrific psychedelic designs and sets. Good fun for the eye. However, while individual static shots are well composed, Vadim doesn't do much with camera movement, so the film isn't as graceful as it could be. He doesn't seem to know much about pacing either - the internal rhythm of the movie is a little bit off which adds to the unsatisfying feel of the whole thing. The cast is fine. Fonda, an otherwise superb actress, does her best with a non-character. She hints at the intelligent, resourceful character Barbarella might have been if the script had been on her side. Milo Oshea is great as the mad scientist, and David Hemmings is fun, if a little wasted, in what amounts to an extended cameo. In summary, a hoot for fans of super-camp kitsch cinema, and a bit of a male sex-fantasy for undiscerning 14 year old boys of all ages, but otherwise, and from the viewpoint of modern grown-up audiences, just an hour and a half of tiresomely sexist trash. Ironically, if Vadim and Co. had retained the sexiness of Barbarella's character but boosted her IQ and resourcefulness then the film might be enjoying a far greater reputation than it currently does. It wouldn't have taken much effort, but they blew it.

    According to my summary... you obviously tought that I have watched it in a porn-like manner. No! Actually, this lovely baby is one cool film! Based up comic book from 1962 and it's really faithful to it, and I am glad because of it. The plot is concentrated on adventures of young sexy heroine Barbarella (Jane Fonda) and her mission to planet Lythion, in the city of Sogo to find a dangerous scientist. I think that Roger Vadim is using a classic luxury from the "space opera" for those grotesque and travesty like situations (for example... cannibal dolls! Cool!) There's constantly this erotic charge in Jane Fonda, which is half-naked or in sexy clothes through entire film. But sometimes there's just too much grotesque on expense of SF components. I think that Vadim did it on purpose and he gave us one rare SF comedy in 60s. But, the entire stuff is too silly. Like you are watching "Rocky Horror Show". Fonda is a great actress, not just sexy, John Philip Law as Pygar, he was great! Anita Pallenberg (Great Tyrant), an exotic sexy rival to Fonda, Milo O'Shea and Marcel Marceau were also great and to mention David Hemmings. A highly recommended must see film. Watch it!

    If you watched the 1980 version of Flash Gordon and thought it was a bit too camp then Barbarella is not the film for you as it makes Flash Gordon look positively restrained! Set in the far future our eponymous heroine is sent on a mission by the President of Earth to find the scientist Durand Durand. He has invented the positronic ray; a weapon that threatens the peace that now exists throughout most of the universe. She heads to the planet where he was last seen but crash-lands. She soon learns that this is a far from safe place although there are some people who are willing to help her on her mission including an angel! Her mission will take her to a city ruled over by an evil tyrant who would happily have Barbarella killed but if she wants to complete her mission she will have to confront her. While this film is a camp classic it has plenty of flaws; much of the acting isn't great, the story is okay at best and the special effects have dated badly. Luckily Jane Fonda is delightful in the title roll managing to bring the necessary innocence to her roll even though she is almost always wearing fairly revealing clothes apart from in the famous opening sequence when she strips down from wearing a space suit to wearing nothing at all! Even that is fairly innocent by today's standards with the credits protecting her modesty most but not quite all of the time. If you like your sci-fi camp then this is a must see otherwise it is more of a curiosity from a more innocent age; sex is referred to but happens off camera, there is no swearing and nudity is limited to a very brief glimpse of Jane Fonda's breasts and backside so it shouldn't offend too many adult viewers.

    I would rather eat all of the vomit off of all of the sidewalks in all of Russia every single day for the rest of my natural life than see a single frame of this film again. I didn't like it. I can not think of another film which is less enjoyable. It is so stupid that it ought to be funny, but in fact it is just disgustingly boring and up its own rectum. Whoever made it should be boiled in a cauldron for a year and the resulting sludge and bones be ground into a fine paste, fed to rats, the rats microwaved for a thousand minutes on high, thrown out the window, devoured by maggots, the maggots drowned in gasoline, this set on fire, and burned until all that remains is a tiny little patch of carbon on the porch which should then be meticulously removed, parceled into a die-cast aluminum capsule, and shot into space. Thank you.

    In the far future, a highly sexual woman (Jane Fonda) is tasked with finding and stopping the evil Durand-Durand. Along the way she encounters various unusual people. What to say about this film? The only thing it can really be compared to is the "Flash Gordon" movie that came out much later. So, I guess if you like that film you have to give some level of respect to this one. I hardly know what to say... it is camp, it is kitsch, it is all that made the 1960s what it was. Some of it is just strange or bordering on exploitation. Other parts are a bit more clever. The idea of the music massage machine is rather clever, even if it went in a strange direction of part-sexuality and part-torture.

    Comic Strip brought appropriately to life . Tremendous fun, amusing scenes , psychedelic frames and many other things . In the far future, the year is 40,000. The protagonist is a highly sexual woman named Barbarella (Jane Fonda , Sophia Loren turned down the title role) is tasked with finding and stopping the evil Durand-Durand (character famously inspired the band name of 1980s pop stars Duran Duran), a missing scientist (Milo O'Shea). Along the quite sexy way she encounters various unusual people . As Barbarella (whose costume was inspired by designer Paco Rabanne) travels to the evil city called SoGo, it is a reference to Biblical cities Sodom and Gomorrah. On her dangerous trip she teams with blind angel Pygar (John Philip Law), and fights the Great Tyrant (Anita Pallenberg) along with numerous sexual torture devices , but she has to save the world . Naif Sci-Fi plenty of colors , thrills , brilliant cinematography by Claude Renoir and fantastic images ; surprisingly, for such a diverse melange, it actually works. Knowingly Camp version of comic-book sci-Fi classic written by Jean Claude Forest . In the original comic, Barbarella was not a secret agent but an outlaw, and the movie omits some of the adventures she had on Lythion, including an encounter with an earlier villainess called the Gorgon, whose face changed into a duplicate of the face of anyone who looked at her. Unlike the other space movies of the time, this film emphasized sets and costumes rather than visual effects, and as a result its overall look dates less than many space operas of the late seventies/early eighties .Jane Fonda is simply unbelievable as gorgeous heroine , she plays a feisty Barbarella , a futuristic girl from Earth . The scenes during the opening credits where Barbarella seems to float around her spaceship were filmed by having Jane Fonda lie on a huge piece of plexiglas with a picture of the spaceship underneath her. It was then filmed from above, creating the illusion that she is in zero gravity. Performance-wise, everyone seems to be camping it up like an end-of-term pantomime, though Milo O'Shea somehow seems to give his villain a deliciously style . Barbarella was the first science fiction hero from the comics to be adapted into a feature film as opposed to a serial , Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers, her male predecessors, had only appeared in serials up to this point. A bit later on , there was realized by Mike Hodges &uml;Flash Gordon&uml; (1980) in similar aesthetic and a TV series titled &uml;Buck Rogers&uml; . Jolly and catching musical score , including commercial songs , by Charles Fox, who co-wrote the songs for this film, also wrote the theme song for another Sci/Fi flick of 1968, The Green Slime, and future Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour was one of the session musicians who performed the film's original score. The motion picture was originally directed by Roger Vadim who married Brigitte Bardot , in fact , the original author Jean-Claude Forest based the character of Barbarella on Brigitte Bardot - who ironically was director Roger Vadim's previous wife ; Vadim subsequently married Jane Fonda . However this film is listed among The 100 Most Amusingly Bad Movies Ever Made in Golden Raspberry Award .

    The plot isn't very important: it's a farcical sci-fi odyssey full of deus ex machina in which a ditzy Jane Fonda saves the universe. The acting, plot, and dialog are all cheesy and superficial, but behind that is something legitimately engaging, worthy, even wondrous. Barabarella *is* creative and has an abundance of striking images that--by virtue of weirdness, ridiculousness, creepiness, or sexiness--will stick with you if you are paying attention. The effects are massively low budget by today's standards: it's more like you're watching a stage play than a film. But this stage play has scenery, costumes, and props that are often really gorgeous and interesting. You'll see hedonists smoking "essence of man" in the City of Night, the priests and architecture of that city, bizarre and disconcerting carnivorous dolls, the Excessive Machine and its hall scattered with the remains of ladies, and the psychedelic Chamber of Dreams. The movie has plenty of interesting concepts too, for which the comic is largely to thank. They are cheesily executed but still thought- provoking. The future has replaced physical sex with some weird psychic act. The galaxy is so peaceful that the only way to combat a terrorist is to dust off weapons found in an old museum. And we see a switcheroo on heaven and hell where the evil are exalted in the beautiful city and the good are exiled to wander around a bleary labyrinth. All of these things are wondrous to see. You just need a coping mechanism to deal with the fact that the dialogue is ridiculous and the acting is often lame--even Marcel Marceau. I found that I could just suspend judgement and go along for the ride. Maybe you can, zen-like, just ignore the embarrassment of it of it all. It's worth it. Did I mention that it's cheesy as hell? But this film is also sexy, fun, creepy, strange, gorgeous, and intriguing. Best watched horny and intoxicated on something or the other. You'll have a blast.

Anita Pallenberg (Great Tyrant), an exotic sexy rival to Fonda, Milo O'Shea and Marcel Marceau were also great and to mention David Hemmings. A highly recommended must see film. Watch it!

    If you watched the 1980 version of Flash Gordon and thought it was a bit too camp then Barbarella is not the film for you as it makes Flash Gordon look positively restrained! Set in the far future our eponymous heroine is sent on a mission by the President of Earth to find the scientist Durand Durand. He has invented the positronic ray; a weapon that threatens the peace that now exists throughout most of the universe. She heads to the planet where he was last seen but crash-lands. She soon learns that this is a far from safe place although there are some people who are willing to help her on her mission including an angel! Her mission will take her to a city ruled over by an evil tyrant who would happily have Barbarella killed but if she wants to complete her mission she will have to confront her. While this film is a camp classic it has plenty of flaws; much of the acting isn't great, the story is okay at best and the special effects have dated badly. Luckily Jane Fonda is delightful in the title roll managing to bring the necessary innocence to her roll even though she is almost always wearing fairly revealing clothes apart from in the famous opening sequence when she strips down from wearing a space suit to wearing nothing at all! Even that is fairly innocent by today's standards with the credits protecting her modesty most but not quite all of the time. If you like your sci-fi camp then this is a must see otherwise it is more of a curiosity from a more innocent age; sex is referred to but happens off camera, there is no swearing and nudity is limited to a very brief glimpse of Jane Fonda's breasts and backside so it shouldn't offend too many adult viewers.

    I would rather eat all of the vomit off of all of the sidewalks in all of Russia every single day for the rest of my natural life than see a single frame of this film again. I didn't like it. I can not think of another film which is less enjoyable. It is so stupid that it ought to be funny, but in fact it is just disgustingly boring and up its own rectum. Whoever made it should be boiled in a cauldron for a year and the resulting sludge and bones be ground into a fine paste, fed to rats, the rats microwaved for a thousand minutes on high, thrown out the window, devoured by maggots, the maggots drowned in gasoline, this set on fire, and burned until all that remains is a tiny little patch of carbon on the porch which should then be meticulously removed, parceled into a die-cast aluminum capsule, and shot into space. Thank you.

    In the far future, a highly sexual woman (Jane Fonda) is tasked with finding and stopping the evil Durand-Durand. Along the way she encounters various unusual people. What to say about this film? The only thing it can really be compared to is the "Flash Gordon" movie that came out much later. So, I guess if you like that film you have to give some level of respect to this one. I hardly know what to say... it is camp, it is kitsch, it is all that made the 1960s what it was. Some of it is just strange or bordering on exploitation. Other parts are a bit more clever. The idea of the music massage machine is rather clever, even if it went in a strange direction of part-sexuality and part-torture.

    Comic Strip brought appropriately to life . Tremendous fun, amusing scenes , psychedelic frames and many other things . In the far future, the year is 40,000. The protagonist is a highly sexual woman named Barbarella (Jane Fonda , Sophia Loren turned down the title role) is tasked with finding and stopping the evil Durand-Durand (character famously inspired the band name of 1980s pop stars Duran Duran), a missing scientist (Milo O'Shea). Along the quite sexy way she encounters various unusual people . As Barbarella (whose costume was inspired by designer Paco Rabanne) travels to the evil city called SoGo, it is a reference to Biblical cities Sodom and Gomorrah. On her dangerous trip she teams with blind angel Pygar (John Philip Law), and fights the Great Tyrant (Anita Pallenberg) along with numerous sexual torture devices , but she has to save the world . Naif Sci-Fi plenty of colors , thrills , brilliant cinematography by Claude Renoir and fantastic images ; surprisingly, for such a diverse melange, it actually works. Knowingly Camp version of comic-book sci-Fi classic written by Jean Claude Forest . In the original comic, Barbarella was not a secret agent but an outlaw, and the movie omits some of the adventures she had on Lythion, including an encounter with an earlier villainess called the Gorgon, whose face changed into a duplicate of the face of anyone who looked at her. Unlike the other space movies of the time, this film emphasized sets and costumes rather than visual effects, and as a result its overall look dates less than many space operas of the late seventies/early eighties .Jane Fonda is simply unbelievable as gorgeous heroine , she plays a feisty Barbarella , a futuristic girl from Earth . The scenes during the opening credits where Barbarella seems to float around her spaceship were filmed by having Jane Fonda lie on a huge piece of plexiglas with a picture of the spaceship underneath her. It was then filmed from above, creating the illusion that she is in zero gravity. Performance-wise, everyone seems to be camping it up like an end-of-term pantomime, though Milo O'Shea somehow seems to give his villain a deliciously style . Barbarella was the first science fiction hero from the comics to be adapted into a feature film as opposed to a serial , Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers, her male predecessors, had only appeared in serials up to this point. A bit later on , there was realized by Mike Hodges &uml;Flash Gordon&uml; (1980) in similar aesthetic and a TV series titled &uml;Buck Rogers&uml; . Jolly and catching musical score , including commercial songs , by Charles Fox, who co-wrote the songs for this film, also wrote the theme song for another Sci/Fi flick of 1968, The Green Slime, and future Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour was one of the session musicians who performed the film's original score. The motion picture was originally directed by Roger Vadim who married Brigitte Bardot , in fact , the original author Jean-Claude Forest based the character of Barbarella on Brigitte Bardot - who ironically was director Roger Vadim's previous wife ; Vadim subsequently married Jane Fonda . However this film is listed among The 100 Most Amusingly Bad Movies Ever Made in Golden Raspberry Award .

    The plot isn't very important: it's a farcical sci-fi odyssey full of deus ex machina in which a ditzy Jane Fonda saves the universe. The acting, plot, and dialog are all cheesy and superficial, but behind that is something legitimately engaging, worthy, even wondrous. Barabarella *is* creative and has an abundance of striking images that--by virtue of weirdness, ridiculousness, creepiness, or sexiness--will stick with you if you are paying attention. The effects are massively low budget by today's standards: it's more like you're watching a stage play than a film. But this stage play has scenery, costumes, and props that are often really gorgeous and interesting. You'll see hedonists smoking "essence of man" in the City of Night, the priests and architecture of that city, bizarre and disconcerting carnivorous dolls, the Excessive Machine and its hall scattered with the remains of ladies, and the psychedelic Chamber of Dreams. The movie has plenty of interesting concepts too, for which the comic is largely to thank. They are cheesily executed but still thought- provoking. The future has replaced physical sex with some weird psychic act. The galaxy is so peaceful that the only way to combat a terrorist is to dust off weapons found in an old museum. And we see a switcheroo on heaven and hell where the evil are exalted in the beautiful city and the good are exiled to wander around a bleary labyrinth. All of these things are wondrous to see. You just need a coping mechanism to deal with the fact that the dialogue is ridiculous and the acting is often lame--even Marcel Marceau. I found that I could just suspend judgement and go along for the ride. Maybe you can, zen-like, just ignore the embarrassment of it of it all. It's worth it. Did I mention that it's cheesy as hell? But this film is also sexy, fun, creepy, strange, gorgeous, and intriguing. Best watched horny and intoxicated on something or the other. You'll have a blast.

    Barbarella (1968) ** (out of 4) Campy sci-fi based on the French comics has Jane Fonda playing the title role, a futuristic superhero who is asked by the President of Earth to travel to a distant planet and rescue a doctor. I can understand why this film has gained a cult following over the past few decades but to me this thing is still a pretty big mess and it's somewhat shocking watching the film to day and looking back and wondering what the original producers were thinking. I mean, if you look at the "story" of this thing, it's a complete mess and it's all over the place. I'm not exactly sure what they were trying to do in regards to the story but it's a complete misfire. Not for a single second do you care about Barbarella's adventure nor do you care about anything she's doing in the film. The reason the film remains entertaining is because it's simply so strange and surreal. Visually the film is quite impressive as a bunch of pulp. The set design and costumes are certainly memorable and the now laughable special effects have a mild charm to them. What really keeps the film moving is seeing someone like Fonda doing a role like this. She's very good in the role, there's no doubt about it, as she can handle the campy moments as well as deliver on the sexuality of the character. Her nude striptease that starts the film is certainly the highlight but they needed more of these throughout. John Phillip Law isn't all that "good" in the film but there's no question that his angel character is quite memorable. Director Roger Vadim doesn't bring enough life, energy or fire to any of the scenes to really make them work and that's certainly not good when you're dealing with a film like this one. BARBARELLA certainly deserves its label as a camp classic but it's just not entertaining enough to be fully rewarding.

    "Barbarella" is clearly not a very good film. The dialog and writing are dumb and much of the acting is dopey. However, I am sure it has a group of loyal followers, as there is a cheesy badness and sexiness that is pretty infectious. It looks in many ways like a sci-fi sex film made by a group of 13 year-olds--13 year-olds with an incredible sense of set design! It's so strange and silly that it's worth seeing at least once--but you might not want others to know you watched it, as their opinions about your taste might be seriously compromised! The film begins with the opening credits--and A LOT of Barbarella, as she appears to float naked in her space ship. For 2012, it's relatively tame but for 1968, it was a VERY hot scene--as are many throughout the film. Today, it might not even be seen as mild porn--more like a mild R-rated film. But, in 1968, it was mega-hot--but still quite silly! Barbarella is instructed by the President of Earth to look for Duran-Duran (also called 'Durand-Durand') and return him to Earth. Along the way, Barbarella has lots of adventures--most of which result in her losing her clothes and/or having sex. Some of the adventures do not--such as the group of crazed kids with flesh-eating dolls--but most everyone (men and women) else seems to want Barbarella and her body. A few of the weird things to look for are the blue bunnies, seeing Marcel Marceau in a SPEAKING role, killer budgies and a killer sex machine! As I said...the sort of stuff teenagers would probably find funny and stimulating! The ending is pretty dumb, but the way--and very anti-climactic. Overall, it's an amazingly stupid film that you can't help but watch because it's so silly and has such super-awesome bizarre sets and costumes (sort of like the products of the top designers of the day if they were on LSD). You just have to see this to believe it...and you still probably won't!

    Scouring the video store shelves in search of something interesting I feel like I should see often yields surprising results, but I wasn't quite prepared for the surprise I got from BARBARELLA: QUEEN OF THE GALAXY. I had a vague idea of what it was (kitschy sci-fi cult classic was my understanding), but, to my initial delight (but eventual disappointment), I had more in store, but perhaps also much, much less. BARBARELLA is a bizarre, psychedelic tale of the sexual awakening of the titular (no pun intended) character, played by an startlingly young and alluring Jane Fonda, a woman sent by the Government of the Republic of Earth to search for scientist Durand Durand. Durand, whose spacecraft disappeared somewhere near mysterious planet Tau Ceti, is the creator of the Positronic Ray, a weapon of unspeakable power which the Earth government wish to retrieve before it falls into unfriendly hands. After crash landing on the planet, Barbarella encounters various odd people and creatures, all of whom seem to exist in a primitive world of sexual liberation. 41st century society has moved on from archaic penetrative intercourse it seems, opting instead for a meditative melding of 'psychocardiograms' (think the virtual sex from DEMOLITION MAN, but less exciting), and Barbarella is initially appalled at the idea, yet after around 20 seconds of coercion from a creep in a bear suit, experiences the pleasures of the flesh for the first time. And so begins the erotic adventures of Barbarella, which include making love to a blind angel, being propositioned by a one-eyed dominatrix who may not be what she seems, and having her body literally played like an organ by the nefarious Durand Durand. Unfortunately, it all sounds a little racier than it is. There's plenty of innuendo and double entendre (one of the characters is named Dildano!), but really it's not pushed far enough, and the film is a little tame. There are laughs to be had, and Fonda is fully committed to the campy lunacy of the script but BARBARELLA doesn't really live up to its cult status. The spectacularly low-budget sets and effects, Fonda's ever-changing and increasingly revealing outfits, and the fun and funky psychedelic lounge music throughout stand out as highlight, but it's far from a good movie. Amazingly Fonda turned down both BONNIE AND CLYDE and ROSEMARY'S BABY to make this, so I guess you have to give her credit for the effort, and perhaps some chemical accompaniment would work in BARBARELLA's favour (as I'm certain there was plenty on set). It's the sort of film which you know you're going to like or hate before even starting it, and I'm not surprised that it has its fans. Unfortunately, I'm not one of them. tinribs27.wordpress.com

    ...she doesn't really do anything. Rather than create the ground breaking heroine they could have, Vadim and his all-too-male crew go for the easy option by portraying the character as not much more than a deceptively dull Barbie-doll figure. She moves from one situation to the next like a wide-eyed tourist, barely taking part in the proceedings, let alone actually causing things to happen. I don't think she solves a single problem in the entire movie. Not with her mind anyway. This is a cardinal sin in film making: creating a lead character who is NOT proactive. Female viewers might be disappointed that the promise of a feisty, sexually confident, independently minded action heroine is only partly fulfilled. Yes, the character is sexually confident, but even that is at the service of the male characters in the film. As for the rest, forget it. Pity. The film makers should have looked to Emma Peel/Kathy Gale from The Avengers for a model of how Barbarella could have worked. On the upside, the movie looks great - terrific psychedelic designs and sets. Good fun for the eye. However, while individual static shots are well composed, Vadim doesn't do much with camera movement, so the film isn't as graceful as it could be. He doesn't seem to know much about pacing either - the internal rhythm of the movie is a little bit off which adds to the unsatisfying feel of the whole thing. The cast is fine. Fonda, an otherwise superb actress, does her best with a non-character. She hints at the intelligent, resourceful character Barbarella might have been if the script had been on her side. Milo Oshea is great as the mad scientist, and David Hemmings is fun, if a little wasted, in what amounts to an extended cameo. In summary, a hoot for fans of super-camp kitsch cinema, and a bit of a male sex-fantasy for undiscerning 14 year old boys of all ages, but otherwise, and from the viewpoint of modern grown-up audiences, just an hour and a half of tiresomely sexist trash. Ironically, if Vadim and Co. had retained the sexiness of Barbarella's character but boosted her IQ and resourcefulness then the film might be enjoying a far greater reputation than it currently does. It wouldn't have taken much effort, but they blew it.

    According to my summary... you obviously tought that I have watched it in a porn-like manner. No! Actually, this lovely baby is one cool film! Based up comic book from 1962 and it's really faithful to it, and I am glad because of it. The plot is concentrated on adventures of young sexy heroine Barbarella (Jane Fonda) and her mission to planet Lythion, in the city of Sogo to find a dangerous scientist. I think that Roger Vadim is using a classic luxury from the "space opera" for those grotesque and travesty like situations (for example... cannibal dolls! Cool!) There's constantly this erotic charge in Jane Fonda, which is half-naked or in sexy clothes through entire film. But sometimes there's just too much grotesque on expense of SF components. I think that Vadim did it on purpose and he gave us one rare SF comedy in 60s. But, the entire stuff is too silly. Like you are watching "Rocky Horror Show". Fonda is a great actress, not just sexy, John Philip Law as Pygar, he was great! Anita Pallenberg (Great Tyrant), an exotic sexy rival to Fonda, Milo O'Shea and Marcel Marceau were also great and to mention David Hemmings. A highly recommended must see film. Watch it!

I mean, if you look at the "story" of this thing, it's a complete mess and it's all over the place. I'm not exactly sure what they were trying to do in regards to the story but it's a complete misfire. Not for a single second do you care about Barbarella's adventure nor do you care about anything she's doing in the film. The reason the film remains entertaining is because it's simply so strange and surreal. Visually the film is quite impressive as a bunch of pulp. The set design and costumes are certainly memorable and the now laughable special effects have a mild charm to them. What really keeps the film moving is seeing someone like Fonda doing a role like this. She's very good in the role, there's no doubt about it, as she can handle the campy moments as well as deliver on the sexuality of the character. Her nude striptease that starts the film is certainly the highlight but they needed more of these throughout. John Phillip Law isn't all that "good" in the film but there's no question that his angel character is quite memorable. Director Roger Vadim doesn't bring enough life, energy or fire to any of the scenes to really make them work and that's certainly not good when you're dealing with a film like this one. BARBARELLA certainly deserves its label as a camp classic but it's just not entertaining enough to be fully rewarding.

    "Barbarella" is clearly not a very good film. The dialog and writing are dumb and much of the acting is dopey. However, I am sure it has a group of loyal followers, as there is a cheesy badness and sexiness that is pretty infectious. It looks in many ways like a sci-fi sex film made by a group of 13 year-olds--13 year-olds with an incredible sense of set design! It's so strange and silly that it's worth seeing at least once--but you might not want others to know you watched it, as their opinions about your taste might be seriously compromised! The film begins with the opening credits--and A LOT of Barbarella, as she appears to float naked in her space ship. For 2012, it's relatively tame but for 1968, it was a VERY hot scene--as are many throughout the film. Today, it might not even be seen as mild porn--more like a mild R-rated film. But, in 1968, it was mega-hot--but still quite silly! Barbarella is instructed by the President of Earth to look for Duran-Duran (also called 'Durand-Durand') and return him to Earth. Along the way, Barbarella has lots of adventures--most of which result in her losing her clothes and/or having sex. Some of the adventures do not--such as the group of crazed kids with flesh-eating dolls--but most everyone (men and women) else seems to want Barbarella and her body. A few of the weird things to look for are the blue bunnies, seeing Marcel Marceau in a SPEAKING role, killer budgies and a killer sex machine! As I said...the sort of stuff teenagers would probably find funny and stimulating! The ending is pretty dumb, but the way--and very anti-climactic. Overall, it's an amazingly stupid film that you can't help but watch because it's so silly and has such super-awesome bizarre sets and costumes (sort of like the products of the top designers of the day if they were on LSD). You just have to see this to believe it...and you still probably won't!

    Scouring the video store shelves in search of something interesting I feel like I should see often yields surprising results, but I wasn't quite prepared for the surprise I got from BARBARELLA: QUEEN OF THE GALAXY. I had a vague idea of what it was (kitschy sci-fi cult classic was my understanding), but, to my initial delight (but eventual disappointment), I had more in store, but perhaps also much, much less. BARBARELLA is a bizarre, psychedelic tale of the sexual awakening of the titular (no pun intended) character, played by an startlingly young and alluring Jane Fonda, a woman sent by the Government of the Republic of Earth to search for scientist Durand Durand. Durand, whose spacecraft disappeared somewhere near mysterious planet Tau Ceti, is the creator of the Positronic Ray, a weapon of unspeakable power which the Earth government wish to retrieve before it falls into unfriendly hands. After crash landing on the planet, Barbarella encounters various odd people and creatures, all of whom seem to exist in a primitive world of sexual liberation. 41st century society has moved on from archaic penetrative intercourse it seems, opting instead for a meditative melding of 'psychocardiograms' (think the virtual sex from DEMOLITION MAN, but less exciting), and Barbarella is initially appalled at the idea, yet after around 20 seconds of coercion from a creep in a bear suit, experiences the pleasures of the flesh for the first time. And so begins the erotic adventures of Barbarella, which include making love to a blind angel, being propositioned by a one-eyed dominatrix who may not be what she seems, and having her body literally played like an organ by the nefarious Durand Durand. Unfortunately, it all sounds a little racier than it is. There's plenty of innuendo and double entendre (one of the characters is named Dildano!), but really it's not pushed far enough, and the film is a little tame. There are laughs to be had, and Fonda is fully committed to the campy lunacy of the script but BARBARELLA doesn't really live up to its cult status. The spectacularly low-budget sets and effects, Fonda's ever-changing and increasingly revealing outfits, and the fun and funky psychedelic lounge music throughout stand out as highlight, but it's far from a good movie. Amazingly Fonda turned down both BONNIE AND CLYDE and ROSEMARY'S BABY to make this, so I guess you have to give her credit for the effort, and perhaps some chemical accompaniment would work in BARBARELLA's favour (as I'm certain there was plenty on set). It's the sort of film which you know you're going to like or hate before even starting it, and I'm not surprised that it has its fans. Unfortunately, I'm not one of them. tinribs27.wordpress.com

    ...she doesn't really do anything. Rather than create the ground breaking heroine they could have, Vadim and his all-too-male crew go for the easy option by portraying the character as not much more than a deceptively dull Barbie-doll figure. She moves from one situation to the next like a wide-eyed tourist, barely taking part in the proceedings, let alone actually causing things to happen. I don't think she solves a single problem in the entire movie. Not with her mind anyway. This is a cardinal sin in film making: creating a lead character who is NOT proactive. Female viewers might be disappointed that the promise of a feisty, sexually confident, independently minded action heroine is only partly fulfilled. Yes, the character is sexually confident, but even that is at the service of the male characters in the film. As for the rest, forget it. Pity. The film makers should have looked to Emma Peel/Kathy Gale from The Avengers for a model of how Barbarella could have worked. On the upside, the movie looks great - terrific psychedelic designs and sets. Good fun for the eye. However, while individual static shots are well composed, Vadim doesn't do much with camera movement, so the film isn't as graceful as it could be. He doesn't seem to know much about pacing either - the internal rhythm of the movie is a little bit off which adds to the unsatisfying feel of the whole thing. The cast is fine. Fonda, an otherwise superb actress, does her best with a non-character. She hints at the intelligent, resourceful character Barbarella might have been if the script had been on her side. Milo Oshea is great as the mad scientist, and David Hemmings is fun, if a little wasted, in what amounts to an extended cameo. In summary, a hoot for fans of super-camp kitsch cinema, and a bit of a male sex-fantasy for undiscerning 14 year old boys of all ages, but otherwise, and from the viewpoint of modern grown-up audiences, just an hour and a half of tiresomely sexist trash. Ironically, if Vadim and Co. had retained the sexiness of Barbarella's character but boosted her IQ and resourcefulness then the film might be enjoying a far greater reputation than it currently does. It wouldn't have taken much effort, but they blew it.

    According to my summary... you obviously tought that I have watched it in a porn-like manner. No! Actually, this lovely baby is one cool film! Based up comic book from 1962 and it's really faithful to it, and I am glad because of it. The plot is concentrated on adventures of young sexy heroine Barbarella (Jane Fonda) and her mission to planet Lythion, in the city of Sogo to find a dangerous scientist. I think that Roger Vadim is using a classic luxury from the "space opera" for those grotesque and travesty like situations (for example... cannibal dolls! Cool!) There's constantly this erotic charge in Jane Fonda, which is half-naked or in sexy clothes through entire film. But sometimes there's just too much grotesque on expense of SF components. I think that Vadim did it on purpose and he gave us one rare SF comedy in 60s. But, the entire stuff is too silly. Like you are watching "Rocky Horror Show". Fonda is a great actress, not just sexy, John Philip Law as Pygar, he was great! Anita Pallenberg (Great Tyrant), an exotic sexy rival to Fonda, Milo O'Shea and Marcel Marceau were also great and to mention David Hemmings. A highly recommended must see film. Watch it!

    If you watched the 1980 version of Flash Gordon and thought it was a bit too camp then Barbarella is not the film for you as it makes Flash Gordon look positively restrained! Set in the far future our eponymous heroine is sent on a mission by the President of Earth to find the scientist Durand Durand. He has invented the positronic ray; a weapon that threatens the peace that now exists throughout most of the universe. She heads to the planet where he was last seen but crash-lands. She soon learns that this is a far from safe place although there are some people who are willing to help her on her mission including an angel! Her mission will take her to a city ruled over by an evil tyrant who would happily have Barbarella killed but if she wants to complete her mission she will have to confront her. While this film is a camp classic it has plenty of flaws; much of the acting isn't great, the story is okay at best and the special effects have dated badly. Luckily Jane Fonda is delightful in the title roll managing to bring the necessary innocence to her roll even though she is almost always wearing fairly revealing clothes apart from in the famous opening sequence when she strips down from wearing a space suit to wearing nothing at all! Even that is fairly innocent by today's standards with the credits protecting her modesty most but not quite all of the time. If you like your sci-fi camp then this is a must see otherwise it is more of a curiosity from a more innocent age; sex is referred to but happens off camera, there is no swearing and nudity is limited to a very brief glimpse of Jane Fonda's breasts and backside so it shouldn't offend too many adult viewers.

    I would rather eat all of the vomit off of all of the sidewalks in all of Russia every single day for the rest of my natural life than see a single frame of this film again. I didn't like it. I can not think of another film which is less enjoyable. It is so stupid that it ought to be funny, but in fact it is just disgustingly boring and up its own rectum. Whoever made it should be boiled in a cauldron for a year and the resulting sludge and bones be ground into a fine paste, fed to rats, the rats microwaved for a thousand minutes on high, thrown out the window, devoured by maggots, the maggots drowned in gasoline, this set on fire, and burned until all that remains is a tiny little patch of carbon on the porch which should then be meticulously removed, parceled into a die-cast aluminum capsule, and shot into space. Thank you.

    In the far future, a highly sexual woman (Jane Fonda) is tasked with finding and stopping the evil Durand-Durand. Along the way she encounters various unusual people. What to say about this film? The only thing it can really be compared to is the "Flash Gordon" movie that came out much later. So, I guess if you like that film you have to give some level of respect to this one. I hardly know what to say... it is camp, it is kitsch, it is all that made the 1960s what it was. Some of it is just strange or bordering on exploitation. Other parts are a bit more clever. The idea of the music massage machine is rather clever, even if it went in a strange direction of part-sexuality and part-torture.

    Comic Strip brought appropriately to life . Tremendous fun, amusing scenes , psychedelic frames and many other things . In the far future, the year is 40,000. The protagonist is a highly sexual woman named Barbarella (Jane Fonda , Sophia Loren turned down the title role) is tasked with finding and stopping the evil Durand-Durand (character famously inspired the band name of 1980s pop stars Duran Duran), a missing scientist (Milo O'Shea). Along the quite sexy way she encounters various unusual people . As Barbarella (whose costume was inspired by designer Paco Rabanne) travels to the evil city called SoGo, it is a reference to Biblical cities Sodom and Gomorrah. On her dangerous trip she teams with blind angel Pygar (John Philip Law), and fights the Great Tyrant (Anita Pallenberg) along with numerous sexual torture devices , but she has to save the world . Naif Sci-Fi plenty of colors , thrills , brilliant cinematography by Claude Renoir and fantastic images ; surprisingly, for such a diverse melange, it actually works. Knowingly Camp version of comic-book sci-Fi classic written by Jean Claude Forest . In the original comic, Barbarella was not a secret agent but an outlaw, and the movie omits some of the adventures she had on Lythion, including an encounter with an earlier villainess called the Gorgon, whose face changed into a duplicate of the face of anyone who looked at her. Unlike the other space movies of the time, this film emphasized sets and costumes rather than visual effects, and as a result its overall look dates less than many space operas of the late seventies/early eighties .Jane Fonda is simply unbelievable as gorgeous heroine , she plays a feisty Barbarella , a futuristic girl from Earth . The scenes during the opening credits where Barbarella seems to float around her spaceship were filmed by having Jane Fonda lie on a huge piece of plexiglas with a picture of the spaceship underneath her. It was then filmed from above, creating the illusion that she is in zero gravity. Performance-wise, everyone seems to be camping it up like an end-of-term pantomime, though Milo O'Shea somehow seems to give his villain a deliciously style . Barbarella was the first science fiction hero from the comics to be adapted into a feature film as opposed to a serial , Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers, her male predecessors, had only appeared in serials up to this point. A bit later on , there was realized by Mike Hodges &uml;Flash Gordon&uml; (1980) in similar aesthetic and a TV series titled &uml;Buck Rogers&uml; . Jolly and catching musical score , including commercial songs , by Charles Fox, who co-wrote the songs for this film, also wrote the theme song for another Sci/Fi flick of 1968, The Green Slime, and future Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour was one of the session musicians who performed the film's original score. The motion picture was originally directed by Roger Vadim who married Brigitte Bardot , in fact , the original author Jean-Claude Forest based the character of Barbarella on Brigitte Bardot - who ironically was director Roger Vadim's previous wife ; Vadim subsequently married Jane Fonda . However this film is listed among The 100 Most Amusingly Bad Movies Ever Made in Golden Raspberry Award .

    The plot isn't very important: it's a farcical sci-fi odyssey full of deus ex machina in which a ditzy Jane Fonda saves the universe. The acting, plot, and dialog are all cheesy and superficial, but behind that is something legitimately engaging, worthy, even wondrous. Barabarella *is* creative and has an abundance of striking images that--by virtue of weirdness, ridiculousness, creepiness, or sexiness--will stick with you if you are paying attention. The effects are massively low budget by today's standards: it's more like you're watching a stage play than a film. But this stage play has scenery, costumes, and props that are often really gorgeous and interesting. You'll see hedonists smoking "essence of man" in the City of Night, the priests and architecture of that city, bizarre and disconcerting carnivorous dolls, the Excessive Machine and its hall scattered with the remains of ladies, and the psychedelic Chamber of Dreams. The movie has plenty of interesting concepts too, for which the comic is largely to thank. They are cheesily executed but still thought- provoking. The future has replaced physical sex with some weird psychic act. The galaxy is so peaceful that the only way to combat a terrorist is to dust off weapons found in an old museum. And we see a switcheroo on heaven and hell where the evil are exalted in the beautiful city and the good are exiled to wander around a bleary labyrinth. All of these things are wondrous to see. You just need a coping mechanism to deal with the fact that the dialogue is ridiculous and the acting is often lame--even Marcel Marceau. I found that I could just suspend judgement and go along for the ride. Maybe you can, zen-like, just ignore the embarrassment of it of it all. It's worth it. Did I mention that it's cheesy as hell? But this film is also sexy, fun, creepy, strange, gorgeous, and intriguing. Best watched horny and intoxicated on something or the other. You'll have a blast.

Anita Pallenberg (Great Tyrant), an exotic sexy rival to Fonda, Milo O'Shea and Marcel Marceau were also great and to mention David Hemmings. A highly recommended must see film. Watch it!

    If you watched the 1980 version of Flash Gordon and thought it was a bit too camp then Barbarella is not the film for you as it makes Flash Gordon look positively restrained! Set in the far future our eponymous heroine is sent on a mission by the President of Earth to find the scientist Durand Durand. He has invented the positronic ray; a weapon that threatens the peace that now exists throughout most of the universe. She heads to the planet where he was last seen but crash-lands. She soon learns that this is a far from safe place although there are some people who are willing to help her on her mission including an angel! Her mission will take her to a city ruled over by an evil tyrant who would happily have Barbarella killed but if she wants to complete her mission she will have to confront her. While this film is a camp classic it has plenty of flaws; much of the acting isn't great, the story is okay at best and the special effects have dated badly. Luckily Jane Fonda is delightful in the title roll managing to bring the necessary innocence to her roll even though she is almost always wearing fairly revealing clothes apart from in the famous opening sequence when she strips down from wearing a space suit to wearing nothing at all! Even that is fairly innocent by today's standards with the credits protecting her modesty most but not quite all of the time. If you like your sci-fi camp then this is a must see otherwise it is more of a curiosity from a more innocent age; sex is referred to but happens off camera, there is no swearing and nudity is limited to a very brief glimpse of Jane Fonda's breasts and backside so it shouldn't offend too many adult viewers.

    I would rather eat all of the vomit off of all of the sidewalks in all of Russia every single day for the rest of my natural life than see a single frame of this film again. I didn't like it. I can not think of another film which is less enjoyable. It is so stupid that it ought to be funny, but in fact it is just disgustingly boring and up its own rectum. Whoever made it should be boiled in a cauldron for a year and the resulting sludge and bones be ground into a fine paste, fed to rats, the rats microwaved for a thousand minutes on high, thrown out the window, devoured by maggots, the maggots drowned in gasoline, this set on fire, and burned until all that remains is a tiny little patch of carbon on the porch which should then be meticulously removed, parceled into a die-cast aluminum capsule, and shot into space. Thank you.

    In the far future, a highly sexual woman (Jane Fonda) is tasked with finding and stopping the evil Durand-Durand. Along the way she encounters various unusual people. What to say about this film? The only thing it can really be compared to is the "Flash Gordon" movie that came out much later. So, I guess if you like that film you have to give some level of respect to this one. I hardly know what to say... it is camp, it is kitsch, it is all that made the 1960s what it was. Some of it is just strange or bordering on exploitation. Other parts are a bit more clever. The idea of the music massage machine is rather clever, even if it went in a strange direction of part-sexuality and part-torture.

    Comic Strip brought appropriately to life . Tremendous fun, amusing scenes , psychedelic frames and many other things . In the far future, the year is 40,000. The protagonist is a highly sexual woman named Barbarella (Jane Fonda , Sophia Loren turned down the title role) is tasked with finding and stopping the evil Durand-Durand (character famously inspired the band name of 1980s pop stars Duran Duran), a missing scientist (Milo O'Shea). Along the quite sexy way she encounters various unusual people . As Barbarella (whose costume was inspired by designer Paco Rabanne) travels to the evil city called SoGo, it is a reference to Biblical cities Sodom and Gomorrah. On her dangerous trip she teams with blind angel Pygar (John Philip Law), and fights the Great Tyrant (Anita Pallenberg) along with numerous sexual torture devices , but she has to save the world . Naif Sci-Fi plenty of colors , thrills , brilliant cinematography by Claude Renoir and fantastic images ; surprisingly, for such a diverse melange, it actually works. Knowingly Camp version of comic-book sci-Fi classic written by Jean Claude Forest . In the original comic, Barbarella was not a secret agent but an outlaw, and the movie omits some of the adventures she had on Lythion, including an encounter with an earlier villainess called the Gorgon, whose face changed into a duplicate of the face of anyone who looked at her. Unlike the other space movies of the time, this film emphasized sets and costumes rather than visual effects, and as a result its overall look dates less than many space operas of the late seventies/early eighties .Jane Fonda is simply unbelievable as gorgeous heroine , she plays a feisty Barbarella , a futuristic girl from Earth . The scenes during the opening credits where Barbarella seems to float around her spaceship were filmed by having Jane Fonda lie on a huge piece of plexiglas with a picture of the spaceship underneath her. It was then filmed from above, creating the illusion that she is in zero gravity. Performance-wise, everyone seems to be camping it up like an end-of-term pantomime, though Milo O'Shea somehow seems to give his villain a deliciously style . Barbarella was the first science fiction hero from the comics to be adapted into a feature film as opposed to a serial , Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers, her male predecessors, had only appeared in serials up to this point. A bit later on , there was realized by Mike Hodges &uml;Flash Gordon&uml; (1980) in similar aesthetic and a TV series titled &uml;Buck Rogers&uml; . Jolly and catching musical score , including commercial songs , by Charles Fox, who co-wrote the songs for this film, also wrote the theme song for another Sci/Fi flick of 1968, The Green Slime, and future Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour was one of the session musicians who performed the film's original score. The motion picture was originally directed by Roger Vadim who married Brigitte Bardot , in fact , the original author Jean-Claude Forest based the character of Barbarella on Brigitte Bardot - who ironically was director Roger Vadim's previous wife ; Vadim subsequently married Jane Fonda . However this film is listed among The 100 Most Amusingly Bad Movies Ever Made in Golden Raspberry Award .

    The plot isn't very important: it's a farcical sci-fi odyssey full of deus ex machina in which a ditzy Jane Fonda saves the universe. The acting, plot, and dialog are all cheesy and superficial, but behind that is something legitimately engaging, worthy, even wondrous. Barabarella *is* creative and has an abundance of striking images that--by virtue of weirdness, ridiculousness, creepiness, or sexiness--will stick with you if you are paying attention. The effects are massively low budget by today's standards: it's more like you're watching a stage play than a film. But this stage play has scenery, costumes, and props that are often really gorgeous and interesting. You'll see hedonists smoking "essence of man" in the City of Night, the priests and architecture of that city, bizarre and disconcerting carnivorous dolls, the Excessive Machine and its hall scattered with the remains of ladies, and the psychedelic Chamber of Dreams. The movie has plenty of interesting concepts too, for which the comic is largely to thank. They are cheesily executed but still thought- provoking. The future has replaced physical sex with some weird psychic act. The galaxy is so peaceful that the only way to combat a terrorist is to dust off weapons found in an old museum. And we see a switcheroo on heaven and hell where the evil are exalted in the beautiful city and the good are exiled to wander around a bleary labyrinth. All of these things are wondrous to see. You just need a coping mechanism to deal with the fact that the dialogue is ridiculous and the acting is often lame--even Marcel Marceau. I found that I could just suspend judgement and go along for the ride. Maybe you can, zen-like, just ignore the embarrassment of it of it all. It's worth it. Did I mention that it's cheesy as hell? But this film is also sexy, fun, creepy, strange, gorgeous, and intriguing. Best watched horny and intoxicated on something or the other. You'll have a blast.

    Barbarella (1968) ** (out of 4) Campy sci-fi based on the French comics has Jane Fonda playing the title role, a futuristic superhero who is asked by the President of Earth to travel to a distant planet and rescue a doctor. I can understand why this film has gained a cult following over the past few decades but to me this thing is still a pretty big mess and it's somewhat shocking watching the film to day and looking back and wondering what the original producers were thinking. I mean, if you look at the "story" of this thing, it's a complete mess and it's all over the place. I'm not exactly sure what they were trying to do in regards to the story but it's a complete misfire. Not for a single second do you care about Barbarella's adventure nor do you care about anything she's doing in the film. The reason the film remains entertaining is because it's simply so strange and surreal. Visually the film is quite impressive as a bunch of pulp. The set design and costumes are certainly memorable and the now laughable special effects have a mild charm to them. What really keeps the film moving is seeing someone like Fonda doing a role like this. She's very good in the role, there's no doubt about it, as she can handle the campy moments as well as deliver on the sexuality of the character. Her nude striptease that starts the film is certainly the highlight but they needed more of these throughout. John Phillip Law isn't all that "good" in the film but there's no question that his angel character is quite memorable. Director Roger Vadim doesn't bring enough life, energy or fire to any of the scenes to really make them work and that's certainly not good when you're dealing with a film like this one. BARBARELLA certainly deserves its label as a camp classic but it's just not entertaining enough to be fully rewarding.

    "Barbarella" is clearly not a very good film. The dialog and writing are dumb and much of the acting is dopey. However, I am sure it has a group of loyal followers, as there is a cheesy badness and sexiness that is pretty infectious. It looks in many ways like a sci-fi sex film made by a group of 13 year-olds--13 year-olds with an incredible sense of set design! It's so strange and silly that it's worth seeing at least once--but you might not want others to know you watched it, as their opinions about your taste might be seriously compromised! The film begins with the opening credits--and A LOT of Barbarella, as she appears to float naked in her space ship. For 2012, it's relatively tame but for 1968, it was a VERY hot scene--as are many throughout the film. Today, it might not even be seen as mild porn--more like a mild R-rated film. But, in 1968, it was mega-hot--but still quite silly! Barbarella is instructed by the President of Earth to look for Duran-Duran (also called 'Durand-Durand') and return him to Earth. Along the way, Barbarella has lots of adventures--most of which result in her losing her clothes and/or having sex. Some of the adventures do not--such as the group of crazed kids with flesh-eating dolls--but most everyone (men and women) else seems to want Barbarella and her body. A few of the weird things to look for are the blue bunnies, seeing Marcel Marceau in a SPEAKING role, killer budgies and a killer sex machine! As I said...the sort of stuff teenagers would probably find funny and stimulating! The ending is pretty dumb, but the way--and very anti-climactic. Overall, it's an amazingly stupid film that you can't help but watch because it's so silly and has such super-awesome bizarre sets and costumes (sort of like the products of the top designers of the day if they were on LSD). You just have to see this to believe it...and you still probably won't!

    Scouring the video store shelves in search of something interesting I feel like I should see often yields surprising results, but I wasn't quite prepared for the surprise I got from BARBARELLA: QUEEN OF THE GALAXY. I had a vague idea of what it was (kitschy sci-fi cult classic was my understanding), but, to my initial delight (but eventual disappointment), I had more in store, but perhaps also much, much less. BARBARELLA is a bizarre, psychedelic tale of the sexual awakening of the titular (no pun intended) character, played by an startlingly young and alluring Jane Fonda, a woman sent by the Government of the Republic of Earth to search for scientist Durand Durand. Durand, whose spacecraft disappeared somewhere near mysterious planet Tau Ceti, is the creator of the Positronic Ray, a weapon of unspeakable power which the Earth government wish to retrieve before it falls into unfriendly hands. After crash landing on the planet, Barbarella encounters various odd people and creatures, all of whom seem to exist in a primitive world of sexual liberation. 41st century society has moved on from archaic penetrative intercourse it seems, opting instead for a meditative melding of 'psychocardiograms' (think the virtual sex from DEMOLITION MAN, but less exciting), and Barbarella is initially appalled at the idea, yet after around 20 seconds of coercion from a creep in a bear suit, experiences the pleasures of the flesh for the first time. And so begins the erotic adventures of Barbarella, which include making love to a blind angel, being propositioned by a one-eyed dominatrix who may not be what she seems, and having her body literally played like an organ by the nefarious Durand Durand. Unfortunately, it all sounds a little racier than it is. There's plenty of innuendo and double entendre (one of the characters is named Dildano!), but really it's not pushed far enough, and the film is a little tame. There are laughs to be had, and Fonda is fully committed to the campy lunacy of the script but BARBARELLA doesn't really live up to its cult status. The spectacularly low-budget sets and effects, Fonda's ever-changing and increasingly revealing outfits, and the fun and funky psychedelic lounge music throughout stand out as highlight, but it's far from a good movie. Amazingly Fonda turned down both BONNIE AND CLYDE and ROSEMARY'S BABY to make this, so I guess you have to give her credit for the effort, and perhaps some chemical accompaniment would work in BARBARELLA's favour (as I'm certain there was plenty on set). It's the sort of film which you know you're going to like or hate before even starting it, and I'm not surprised that it has its fans. Unfortunately, I'm not one of them. tinribs27.wordpress.com

    ...she doesn't really do anything. Rather than create the ground breaking heroine they could have, Vadim and his all-too-male crew go for the easy option by portraying the character as not much more than a deceptively dull Barbie-doll figure. She moves from one situation to the next like a wide-eyed tourist, barely taking part in the proceedings, let alone actually causing things to happen. I don't think she solves a single problem in the entire movie. Not with her mind anyway. This is a cardinal sin in film making: creating a lead character who is NOT proactive. Female viewers might be disappointed that the promise of a feisty, sexually confident, independently minded action heroine is only partly fulfilled. Yes, the character is sexually confident, but even that is at the service of the male characters in the film. As for the rest, forget it. Pity. The film makers should have looked to Emma Peel/Kathy Gale from The Avengers for a model of how Barbarella could have worked. On the upside, the movie looks great - terrific psychedelic designs and sets. Good fun for the eye. However, while individual static shots are well composed, Vadim doesn't do much with camera movement, so the film isn't as graceful as it could be. He doesn't seem to know much about pacing either - the internal rhythm of the movie is a little bit off which adds to the unsatisfying feel of the whole thing. The cast is fine. Fonda, an otherwise superb actress, does her best with a non-character. She hints at the intelligent, resourceful character Barbarella might have been if the script had been on her side. Milo Oshea is great as the mad scientist, and David Hemmings is fun, if a little wasted, in what amounts to an extended cameo. In summary, a hoot for fans of super-camp kitsch cinema, and a bit of a male sex-fantasy for undiscerning 14 year old boys of all ages, but otherwise, and from the viewpoint of modern grown-up audiences, just an hour and a half of tiresomely sexist trash. Ironically, if Vadim and Co. had retained the sexiness of Barbarella's character but boosted her IQ and resourcefulness then the film might be enjoying a far greater reputation than it currently does. It wouldn't have taken much effort, but they blew it.

    According to my summary... you obviously tought that I have watched it in a porn-like manner. No! Actually, this lovely baby is one cool film! Based up comic book from 1962 and it's really faithful to it, and I am glad because of it. The plot is concentrated on adventures of young sexy heroine Barbarella (Jane Fonda) and her mission to planet Lythion, in the city of Sogo to find a dangerous scientist. I think that Roger Vadim is using a classic luxury from the "space opera" for those grotesque and travesty like situations (for example... cannibal dolls! Cool!) There's constantly this erotic charge in Jane Fonda, which is half-naked or in sexy clothes through entire film. But sometimes there's just too much grotesque on expense of SF components. I think that Vadim did it on purpose and he gave us one rare SF comedy in 60s. But, the entire stuff is too silly. Like you are watching "Rocky Horror Show". Fonda is a great actress, not just sexy, John Philip Law as Pygar, he was great! Anita Pallenberg (Great Tyrant), an exotic sexy rival to Fonda, Milo O'Shea and Marcel Marceau were also great and to mention David Hemmings. A highly recommended must see film. Watch it!
