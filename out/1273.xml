 <sinopse>
  A color-blind psychiatrist Bill Capa is stalked by an unknown killer after taking over his murdered friend's therapy group, all of whom have a connection to a mysterious young woman that Capa begins having intense sexual encounters with.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Psychologist Bill Capa gives up his practise when he unintentionally pushes a patient to commit suicide. In an effort to come to terms with this tragedy he visits an old colleague, Bob Moore, who is subsequently murdered. The quest to catch the killer centres around a group of Moore's psychologically disturbed patients, however equally as important is an affair which develops between Capa and the mysterious Rose. This relationship, at first a diversion, becomes central to the plot as the film progresses.

    Color of Night is an erotic mystery thriller that stars Bruce Willis and Jane March.It is a story about New York psychiatrist Bill Capa,who visits Los Angeles to take over his murdered colleague's therapy group and then he finds himself embroiled in the thick of a mystery when he meets into Rosa,who happens to be an aspiring actress with a sexy overbite and hardly wearing any underwear,and they begin a torrid love affair. Richard Rush is the director of the film. The film has has much in the way of sex.Probably just a hairline away to finally avoid the dreaded NC-17. Still, there's plenty of sex scenes and nudity between Willis and March. Aside from that,the audience is treated to a plot itself seems too ridiculous to be taken seriously.There is a murder mystery involved and the following are the suspects:Clark,who suffers from severe obsessive compulsive disorder and insists on cleanliness and counting things whose temper caused him to beat up his wife;Sondra,a nymphomaniac and kleptomaniac who stabbed her father with a knife and fork and had a husband died of unnatural causes;Buck,a suicidal ex-cop whose wife and daughter's murders remains unsolved;Casey,an arrogant son of a wealthy man, paints sado-masochist works of art that once burned down his father's house; and finally Richie,a 16-year-old with social anxiety disorder, a stutter and gender identity disorder who wants to be a woman and has has a history of drug use. But viewers will identify the suspect an hour away before the movie ends. Overall,it is movie becomes awful as it tries to mix of black humor and clever plotting intelligently but was unable to do so.But watch it for the sex scenes alone.

    COLOR OF NIGHT is a dated, cheesy, film, a '90s misfire that attempted to ride the wave of psycho-sexual thrillers in the wake of FATAL ATTRACTION and BASIC INSTINCT and failed from the outset. The most annoying thing about the production is that the plot hinges on a crucial twist that will be obvious to even the most shortsighted viewer, right from the outset, but we're asked to suspend our disbelief until the very end before said twist is revealed. Nobody in their right mind can do that. Still, despite the paucity of imagination and the silliness of the script, watching this movie turns out to be quite a lot of fun. It's one of those films you can put into the so-bad-it's-good category of entertainment, in that it's filled with unintentional laughs and funny scenes that showcase some OTT acting from most of the cast. Whether it's Bruce Willis's hairpiece or the overblown pool sex scene (although Paul Verhoeven topped that a year later in SHOWGIRLS), COLOR OF NIGHT is frequently amusing. Besides, you have to give the film some credit for its cast alone, a seasoned who's who of '90s-era talent. I particularly like the way the casting director fixed up a bunch of well-known genre actors in supporting roles; well done that man! We're treated to non-bad-guy turns from Lance Henriksen and Brad Dourif (how often can you say that?), PREDATOR 2's Ruben Blades as the comic relief/detective, Lesley Ann Warren as a sex addict, a typically kooky Kevin J. O'Connor, and even Mr. QUANTUM LEAP himself, Scott Bakula. As for the central twosome, well...the best you can say is that this is when Willis was still acting in his roles, rather than riding along on monotonous autopilot as he does these days (in A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD, for instance). Jane March is pretty and alluring, but is she out of her depth in a psychologically complex part? I think so! Director Richard Rush started out making trash movies '60s and his mindset is evident in the cheesy stalk-n-slash sequences and overblown stylistics on offer here. COLOR OF NIGHT might be a trashy attempt at a thriller, but it's a fun one with it.

    Looking at the other reviews, this film is like marmite - you either like it or hate it! I liked it quite a lot. Bruce Willis is quite enjoyable - you could compare it to The Sixth Sense - he's a therapist in that one too. It's the kind of film where there are preposterous moments that make you smile, but there's enough good acting to outweigh that. Is it 'so bad, it's good'? - Yes at times it falls into that category - especially in the closing scenes. However, lots of credit to Jane March... call me slow on the uptake if you like, but I had no inkling that Ritchie/Rose are the same actress till the end. One thing that lets it down is the music - fairly corny at times, could have been much improved with a more original score. I think Dale should have risen one more time from the dead, to make it a truly 'so bad it's good' film!

    Two things happen at psychiatrist Bruce Willis' group therapy - one, he drops into a hot and heavy relationship with a tasty young thing and, two, patients start getting murdered. There are two ways of describing this movie. One is by applying the label "erotic thriller". The other is by describing it thus: ludicrous melodrama where half the characters remain at hysteria pitch throughout, and Bruce Willis reveals all in a series of sex scenes with Jane March who, despite getting her kit off frequently, fails to establish this as the breakthrough role it should have been given the scope of her character. This film is not un-entertaining, but it's for all the wrong reasons.

    This movie is most certainly not a masterpiece deserving of a perfect rating, but when I see a solid movie with ratings lower than some total trash I have no option but to overrate in order to contribute at least a little bit to what I think is a proper rating for a movie... That being said, this movie is actually a solid 7 in my book because it delivers a good plot without too many holes and without over-stretching my suspension of disbelief. It also delivers solid acting and well developed characters, including the support cast which is a rarity in modern Hollywood movies. In short, my feeling was that all the characters were played well, were believable and easy to connect with. Special kudos go to Jane March who is not only very beautiful and graceful in this role but pulls of a multiple personality role quite well in my opinion and is overall a pleasure to watch and this has nothing to do with the nude scenes which are just an added bonus for some of the audience... Finally, I suspect this movie is so poorly rated in part because of the aforementioned nudity as I noticed a trend in this regard with all the puritans racing to give a rating of 1/10 to any movie containing nudity.

    Color of Night is a very vibrant, colorful film with odd characters from the very beginning. The opening scenes are jarring leaving one trying to figure out just what exactly is going on. What is going to happen next? The acting by everyone is excellent. I think this is Bruce Willis' best acting yet. His character is very endearing and likable. In fact, all of the characters, as kooky as they may be, are likable here leaving an impression after seeing this. There are very clever split screen shots using mirrors so that we can see both characters during conversations. The film is overdone though. It becomes a bit too heavy-handed near the end and then we are left with an overdub from one of the characters that seems silly. Also, when we find out who the killer is the actor seems a little uncomfortable with his dialog. Not perfect by any means but very unique and very well shot. Almost feels like a Brian Depalma film. A mysterious thriller that pulls you in and keeps you interested.

    if u like campy movies like showgirls you will probably like this movie! now i admit there are a few plot holes and seeing Jane March in disguise is pretty obvious. but aside from that the acting of the cast is pretty good Jane March, and Lesley Ann Warren are particularly good and Ruben Blades is pretty funny as a wound way to tight inspector. Bruce Willis is about as good as he usually is. about the plot holes that red car pushing the car from the top of the parking garage trying to crush Willis didn't make much sense i don't know how the killer would know he was in that spot from way up there and Mrs. Niedelmeyer knowing about Ritchie's death doesn't make sense if dale covered it up. the film does however keep you guessing as to who the killer is. at first with march's obvious disguise you instantly suspect her however the film throws enough curve balls to evenly spread out the suspicion among the viewers. the film as a whole it is a great erotic thriller the sex scenes are so hot and the ending is probably one of the best twist endings I've seen in a while. sadly the poor march's poor disguise spoil the surprise however it is quite a cleaver idea i must give credit to the writers. so give it a chance if you don't think its a good movie you might at least see it as a so-bad-its-good movie you can enjoy.

    This film is extremely good. Of course, since it is a head shrink film, we can imagine the twisted denouement from the very beginning, that it will have to do with sexual identification or dis-identification, but at the same time it is done well enough for us to have some kind of doubts and follow the events the way they come and be surprised by the details of the horror of these perverted psychos. I won't give you the details because that would go against the confidentiality rule that I gave sworn to respect once I became an almighty reviewer, or critic. I do breach that sworn confidentiality all the time, but this time no, not at all. You can send Dexter and I won't do it either. I am not afraid of Dexter and anyway he will never be able to cut me into small pieces because I am protected the charm of my old years. If you want the details you'll have to watch the film. But make sure you know what's the difference between a boy and a girl and vice versa otherwise you may get slightly sick which would be your punishment since you had been warned. Enjoy that trip to Los Angeles, the perfectly well named city of angels. So many little angels are fluttering around our heads in this basically murderous city.

    The Color of Night is actually one of those rare achievements that no director or screenwriter could possibly strive for if they wanted to. A film that fails at pretty much everything it aspires, but manages to become compulsively viewable to see how much further a train wreck it can become and, by some strange twist, actually attains a level of guilty entertainment value it really does not deserve. Blending together the elements of a psychological Hitchcock thriller with the eroticism of Basic Instinct/Fatal Attraction/late night Cinemax films, the filmmakers end up with a conglomeration that was probably a far cry from what they intended, particularly given that director Richard Rush was actually a director of some reputation. Psychologist Bruce Willis has gone color blind since his inept attempts at counseling led to the unintentional suicide of a patient. He decides to seek solace with an old colleague Scott Bakula, who ends up murdered. Police seem to believe that the culprit is one of the participants of the group therapy sessions that Bakula oversaw and Willis steps in to ferret out the culprit. Meanwhile, Willis crosses paths with enigmatic young sexpot Jane March who may be more involved than he suspects. The group therapy sessions are a great source of unintentional comedy. Made up of fairly reliable character actors like Lance Henriksen, Kevin O'Connor and Lesley Ann Warren, all seem to realize that they are in glorified garbage and find intriguing ways in which to embellish their characters and hog the screen. In between, comical therapy sessions, Rush inserts an obligatory chase scene, a bloody murder, or an energetic sex romp between the leads. No one can ever accuse the film of being a bore. Unfortunately the ham factor does not extend to the leads. March has been handed a virtually unplayable part filled with assorted pitfalls, and even the more remedial elements seem out of her reach. She never seems vampish enough to attract the kind of attention bestowed upon her in the film. Even worse, March's distinctive looks render a latter-film plot twist psychotically absurd when the audience has been leagues ahead of everyone else on screen and the respective characters' bafflement seems downright jaw-dropping. Much press was spilled about the torrid sex scenes compiled for the film, including much ballyhooed full frontal exposure from leading man Willis, but the leads generate no sparks. I give Willis credit for a) generously stepping up to the plate and showing substantial skin at a time when most American mainstream leading men would have run in the opposite direction, and b) trying to play the lead role seriously, but he is positively lifeless in this film. One has no rooting interest in either his relationship with March, his ability to counsel his patients, or whether he will even make it out of the various chase/attack scenes in one piece. He has rendered himself into a virtual stick of wood devoid of any emotion. Yet, in spite of its miscast and outmatched leads and the thoroughly incompetent direction, the film has that car accident quality that keeps one watching well past the point where it should be turned off. The conclusion is pure Grand Guignol corn with a bit of a cheat on the murderer, but what an unintentionally hilarious loony ride it is to that point.

    I don't really see how this ever got a Razzie award, because it's way too middle of the road for that. It's a standard thriller with standard suspects and a standard yet pretty creative outcome. It's really unexceptional in every possible way, except maybe for the surprisingly tacky sex scenes and gratuitous nudity, which gives it kind of an exploitation feel. Not enough to call it bad. At some points the writing is also a bit forced. The makers noticed they hadn't had anything happening in ages so they threw in a car chase for some reason. Would the killer really take that kind of risk? Even though this movie has quite a lot of flaws, it actually does manage to be entertaining. The mystery stays exciting throughout and the ending does not disappoint. It's bizarre and unbelievable, but it does not disappoint. Overall I'd say this movie isn't nearly as bad as what some people seemed to believe.

    The Color of Night is actually one of those rare achievements that no director or screenwriter could possibly strive for if they wanted to. A film that fails at pretty much everything it aspires, but manages to become compulsively viewable to see how much further a train wreck it can become and, by some strange twist, actually attains a level of guilty entertainment value it really does not deserve. Blending together the elements of a psychological Hitchcock thriller with the eroticism of Basic Instinct/Fatal Attraction/late night Cinemax films, the filmmakers end up with a conglomeration that was probably a far cry from what they intended, particularly given that director Richard Rush was actually a director of some reputation. Psychologist Bruce Willis has gone color blind since his inept attempts at counseling led to the unintentional suicide of a patient. He decides to seek solace with an old colleague Scott Bakula, who ends up murdered. Police seem to believe that the culprit is one of the participants of the group therapy sessions that Bakula oversaw and Willis steps in to ferret out the culprit. Meanwhile, Willis crosses paths with enigmatic young sexpot Jane March who may be more involved than he suspects. The group therapy sessions are a great source of unintentional comedy. Made up of fairly reliable character actors like Lance Henriksen, Kevin O'Connor and Lesley Ann Warren, all seem to realize that they are in glorified garbage and find intriguing ways in which to embellish their characters and hog the screen. In between, comical therapy sessions, Rush inserts an obligatory chase scene, a bloody murder, or an energetic sex romp between the leads. No one can ever accuse the film of being a bore. Unfortunately the ham factor does not extend to the leads. March has been handed a virtually unplayable part filled with assorted pitfalls, and even the more remedial elements seem out of her reach. She never seems vampish enough to attract the kind of attention bestowed upon her in the film. Even worse, March's distinctive looks render a latter-film plot twist psychotically absurd when the audience has been leagues ahead of everyone else on screen and the respective characters' bafflement seems downright jaw-dropping. Much press was spilled about the torrid sex scenes compiled for the film, including much ballyhooed full frontal exposure from leading man Willis, but the leads generate no sparks. I give Willis credit for a) generously stepping up to the plate and showing substantial skin at a time when most American mainstream leading men would have run in the opposite direction, and b) trying to play the lead role seriously, but he is positively lifeless in this film. One has no rooting interest in either his relationship with March, his ability to counsel his patients, or whether he will even make it out of the various chase/attack scenes in one piece. He has rendered himself into a virtual stick of wood devoid of any emotion. Yet, in spite of its miscast and outmatched leads and the thoroughly incompetent direction, the film has that car accident quality that keeps one watching well past the point where it should be turned off. The conclusion is pure Grand Guignol corn with a bit of a cheat on the murderer, but what an unintentionally hilarious loony ride it is to that point.

    I don't really see how this ever got a Razzie award, because it's way too middle of the road for that. It's a standard thriller with standard suspects and a standard yet pretty creative outcome. It's really unexceptional in every possible way, except maybe for the surprisingly tacky sex scenes and gratuitous nudity, which gives it kind of an exploitation feel. Not enough to call it bad. At some points the writing is also a bit forced. The makers noticed they hadn't had anything happening in ages so they threw in a car chase for some reason. Would the killer really take that kind of risk? Even though this movie has quite a lot of flaws, it actually does manage to be entertaining. The mystery stays exciting throughout and the ending does not disappoint. It's bizarre and unbelievable, but it does not disappoint. Overall I'd say this movie isn't nearly as bad as what some people seemed to believe.

    Color of Night is an erotic mystery thriller that stars Bruce Willis and Jane March.It is a story about New York psychiatrist Bill Capa,who visits Los Angeles to take over his murdered colleague's therapy group and then he finds himself embroiled in the thick of a mystery when he meets into Rosa,who happens to be an aspiring actress with a sexy overbite and hardly wearing any underwear,and they begin a torrid love affair. Richard Rush is the director of the film. The film has has much in the way of sex.Probably just a hairline away to finally avoid the dreaded NC-17. Still, there's plenty of sex scenes and nudity between Willis and March. Aside from that,the audience is treated to a plot itself seems too ridiculous to be taken seriously.There is a murder mystery involved and the following are the suspects:Clark,who suffers from severe obsessive compulsive disorder and insists on cleanliness and counting things whose temper caused him to beat up his wife;Sondra,a nymphomaniac and kleptomaniac who stabbed her father with a knife and fork and had a husband died of unnatural causes;Buck,a suicidal ex-cop whose wife and daughter's murders remains unsolved;Casey,an arrogant son of a wealthy man, paints sado-masochist works of art that once burned down his father's house; and finally Richie,a 16-year-old with social anxiety disorder, a stutter and gender identity disorder who wants to be a woman and has has a history of drug use. But viewers will identify the suspect an hour away before the movie ends. Overall,it is movie becomes awful as it tries to mix of black humor and clever plotting intelligently but was unable to do so.But watch it for the sex scenes alone.

    COLOR OF NIGHT is a dated, cheesy, film, a '90s misfire that attempted to ride the wave of psycho-sexual thrillers in the wake of FATAL ATTRACTION and BASIC INSTINCT and failed from the outset. The most annoying thing about the production is that the plot hinges on a crucial twist that will be obvious to even the most shortsighted viewer, right from the outset, but we're asked to suspend our disbelief until the very end before said twist is revealed. Nobody in their right mind can do that. Still, despite the paucity of imagination and the silliness of the script, watching this movie turns out to be quite a lot of fun. It's one of those films you can put into the so-bad-it's-good category of entertainment, in that it's filled with unintentional laughs and funny scenes that showcase some OTT acting from most of the cast. Whether it's Bruce Willis's hairpiece or the overblown pool sex scene (although Paul Verhoeven topped that a year later in SHOWGIRLS), COLOR OF NIGHT is frequently amusing. Besides, you have to give the film some credit for its cast alone, a seasoned who's who of '90s-era talent. I particularly like the way the casting director fixed up a bunch of well-known genre actors in supporting roles; well done that man! We're treated to non-bad-guy turns from Lance Henriksen and Brad Dourif (how often can you say that?), PREDATOR 2's Ruben Blades as the comic relief/detective, Lesley Ann Warren as a sex addict, a typically kooky Kevin J. O'Connor, and even Mr. QUANTUM LEAP himself, Scott Bakula. As for the central twosome, well...the best you can say is that this is when Willis was still acting in his roles, rather than riding along on monotonous autopilot as he does these days (in A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD, for instance). Jane March is pretty and alluring, but is she out of her depth in a psychologically complex part? I think so! Director Richard Rush started out making trash movies '60s and his mindset is evident in the cheesy stalk-n-slash sequences and overblown stylistics on offer here. COLOR OF NIGHT might be a trashy attempt at a thriller, but it's a fun one with it.

    Looking at the other reviews, this film is like marmite - you either like it or hate it! I liked it quite a lot. Bruce Willis is quite enjoyable - you could compare it to The Sixth Sense - he's a therapist in that one too. It's the kind of film where there are preposterous moments that make you smile, but there's enough good acting to outweigh that. Is it 'so bad, it's good'? - Yes at times it falls into that category - especially in the closing scenes. However, lots of credit to Jane March... call me slow on the uptake if you like, but I had no inkling that Ritchie/Rose are the same actress till the end. One thing that lets it down is the music - fairly corny at times, could have been much improved with a more original score. I think Dale should have risen one more time from the dead, to make it a truly 'so bad it's good' film!

    Two things happen at psychiatrist Bruce Willis' group therapy - one, he drops into a hot and heavy relationship with a tasty young thing and, two, patients start getting murdered. There are two ways of describing this movie. One is by applying the label "erotic thriller". The other is by describing it thus: ludicrous melodrama where half the characters remain at hysteria pitch throughout, and Bruce Willis reveals all in a series of sex scenes with Jane March who, despite getting her kit off frequently, fails to establish this as the breakthrough role it should have been given the scope of her character. This film is not un-entertaining, but it's for all the wrong reasons.

    This movie is most certainly not a masterpiece deserving of a perfect rating, but when I see a solid movie with ratings lower than some total trash I have no option but to overrate in order to contribute at least a little bit to what I think is a proper rating for a movie... That being said, this movie is actually a solid 7 in my book because it delivers a good plot without too many holes and without over-stretching my suspension of disbelief. It also delivers solid acting and well developed characters, including the support cast which is a rarity in modern Hollywood movies. In short, my feeling was that all the characters were played well, were believable and easy to connect with. Special kudos go to Jane March who is not only very beautiful and graceful in this role but pulls of a multiple personality role quite well in my opinion and is overall a pleasure to watch and this has nothing to do with the nude scenes which are just an added bonus for some of the audience... Finally, I suspect this movie is so poorly rated in part because of the aforementioned nudity as I noticed a trend in this regard with all the puritans racing to give a rating of 1/10 to any movie containing nudity.

    Color of Night is a very vibrant, colorful film with odd characters from the very beginning. The opening scenes are jarring leaving one trying to figure out just what exactly is going on. What is going to happen next? The acting by everyone is excellent. I think this is Bruce Willis' best acting yet. His character is very endearing and likable. In fact, all of the characters, as kooky as they may be, are likable here leaving an impression after seeing this. There are very clever split screen shots using mirrors so that we can see both characters during conversations. The film is overdone though. It becomes a bit too heavy-handed near the end and then we are left with an overdub from one of the characters that seems silly. Also, when we find out who the killer is the actor seems a little uncomfortable with his dialog. Not perfect by any means but very unique and very well shot. Almost feels like a Brian Depalma film. A mysterious thriller that pulls you in and keeps you interested.

    if u like campy movies like showgirls you will probably like this movie! now i admit there are a few plot holes and seeing Jane March in disguise is pretty obvious. but aside from that the acting of the cast is pretty good Jane March, and Lesley Ann Warren are particularly good and Ruben Blades is pretty funny as a wound way to tight inspector. Bruce Willis is about as good as he usually is. about the plot holes that red car pushing the car from the top of the parking garage trying to crush Willis didn't make much sense i don't know how the killer would know he was in that spot from way up there and Mrs. Niedelmeyer knowing about Ritchie's death doesn't make sense if dale covered it up. the film does however keep you guessing as to who the killer is. at first with march's obvious disguise you instantly suspect her however the film throws enough curve balls to evenly spread out the suspicion among the viewers. the film as a whole it is a great erotic thriller the sex scenes are so hot and the ending is probably one of the best twist endings I've seen in a while. sadly the poor march's poor disguise spoil the surprise however it is quite a cleaver idea i must give credit to the writers. so give it a chance if you don't think its a good movie you might at least see it as a so-bad-its-good movie you can enjoy.

    This film is extremely good. Of course, since it is a head shrink film, we can imagine the twisted denouement from the very beginning, that it will have to do with sexual identification or dis-identification, but at the same time it is done well enough for us to have some kind of doubts and follow the events the way they come and be surprised by the details of the horror of these perverted psychos. I won't give you the details because that would go against the confidentiality rule that I gave sworn to respect once I became an almighty reviewer, or critic. I do breach that sworn confidentiality all the time, but this time no, not at all. You can send Dexter and I won't do it either. I am not afraid of Dexter and anyway he will never be able to cut me into small pieces because I am protected the charm of my old years. If you want the details you'll have to watch the film. But make sure you know what's the difference between a boy and a girl and vice versa otherwise you may get slightly sick which would be your punishment since you had been warned. Enjoy that trip to Los Angeles, the perfectly well named city of angels. So many little angels are fluttering around our heads in this basically murderous city.

    The Color of Night is actually one of those rare achievements that no director or screenwriter could possibly strive for if they wanted to. A film that fails at pretty much everything it aspires, but manages to become compulsively viewable to see how much further a train wreck it can become and, by some strange twist, actually attains a level of guilty entertainment value it really does not deserve. Blending together the elements of a psychological Hitchcock thriller with the eroticism of Basic Instinct/Fatal Attraction/late night Cinemax films, the filmmakers end up with a conglomeration that was probably a far cry from what they intended, particularly given that director Richard Rush was actually a director of some reputation. Psychologist Bruce Willis has gone color blind since his inept attempts at counseling led to the unintentional suicide of a patient. He decides to seek solace with an old colleague Scott Bakula, who ends up murdered. Police seem to believe that the culprit is one of the participants of the group therapy sessions that Bakula oversaw and Willis steps in to ferret out the culprit. Meanwhile, Willis crosses paths with enigmatic young sexpot Jane March who may be more involved than he suspects. The group therapy sessions are a great source of unintentional comedy. Made up of fairly reliable character actors like Lance Henriksen, Kevin O'Connor and Lesley Ann Warren, all seem to realize that they are in glorified garbage and find intriguing ways in which to embellish their characters and hog the screen. In between, comical therapy sessions, Rush inserts an obligatory chase scene, a bloody murder, or an energetic sex romp between the leads. No one can ever accuse the film of being a bore. Unfortunately the ham factor does not extend to the leads. March has been handed a virtually unplayable part filled with assorted pitfalls, and even the more remedial elements seem out of her reach. She never seems vampish enough to attract the kind of attention bestowed upon her in the film. Even worse, March's distinctive looks render a latter-film plot twist psychotically absurd when the audience has been leagues ahead of everyone else on screen and the respective characters' bafflement seems downright jaw-dropping. Much press was spilled about the torrid sex scenes compiled for the film, including much ballyhooed full frontal exposure from leading man Willis, but the leads generate no sparks. I give Willis credit for a) generously stepping up to the plate and showing substantial skin at a time when most American mainstream leading men would have run in the opposite direction, and b) trying to play the lead role seriously, but he is positively lifeless in this film. One has no rooting interest in either his relationship with March, his ability to counsel his patients, or whether he will even make it out of the various chase/attack scenes in one piece. He has rendered himself into a virtual stick of wood devoid of any emotion. Yet, in spite of its miscast and outmatched leads and the thoroughly incompetent direction, the film has that car accident quality that keeps one watching well past the point where it should be turned off. The conclusion is pure Grand Guignol corn with a bit of a cheat on the murderer, but what an unintentionally hilarious loony ride it is to that point.

Of course, since it is a head shrink film, we can imagine the twisted denouement from the very beginning, that it will have to do with sexual identification or dis-identification, but at the same time it is done well enough for us to have some kind of doubts and follow the events the way they come and be surprised by the details of the horror of these perverted psychos. I won't give you the details because that would go against the confidentiality rule that I gave sworn to respect once I became an almighty reviewer, or critic. I do breach that sworn confidentiality all the time, but this time no, not at all. You can send Dexter and I won't do it either. I am not afraid of Dexter and anyway he will never be able to cut me into small pieces because I am protected the charm of my old years. If you want the details you'll have to watch the film. But make sure you know what's the difference between a boy and a girl and vice versa otherwise you may get slightly sick which would be your punishment since you had been warned. Enjoy that trip to Los Angeles, the perfectly well named city of angels. So many little angels are fluttering around our heads in this basically murderous city.

    The Color of Night is actually one of those rare achievements that no director or screenwriter could possibly strive for if they wanted to. A film that fails at pretty much everything it aspires, but manages to become compulsively viewable to see how much further a train wreck it can become and, by some strange twist, actually attains a level of guilty entertainment value it really does not deserve. Blending together the elements of a psychological Hitchcock thriller with the eroticism of Basic Instinct/Fatal Attraction/late night Cinemax films, the filmmakers end up with a conglomeration that was probably a far cry from what they intended, particularly given that director Richard Rush was actually a director of some reputation. Psychologist Bruce Willis has gone color blind since his inept attempts at counseling led to the unintentional suicide of a patient. He decides to seek solace with an old colleague Scott Bakula, who ends up murdered. Police seem to believe that the culprit is one of the participants of the group therapy sessions that Bakula oversaw and Willis steps in to ferret out the culprit. Meanwhile, Willis crosses paths with enigmatic young sexpot Jane March who may be more involved than he suspects. The group therapy sessions are a great source of unintentional comedy. Made up of fairly reliable character actors like Lance Henriksen, Kevin O'Connor and Lesley Ann Warren, all seem to realize that they are in glorified garbage and find intriguing ways in which to embellish their characters and hog the screen. In between, comical therapy sessions, Rush inserts an obligatory chase scene, a bloody murder, or an energetic sex romp between the leads. No one can ever accuse the film of being a bore. Unfortunately the ham factor does not extend to the leads. March has been handed a virtually unplayable part filled with assorted pitfalls, and even the more remedial elements seem out of her reach. She never seems vampish enough to attract the kind of attention bestowed upon her in the film. Even worse, March's distinctive looks render a latter-film plot twist psychotically absurd when the audience has been leagues ahead of everyone else on screen and the respective characters' bafflement seems downright jaw-dropping. Much press was spilled about the torrid sex scenes compiled for the film, including much ballyhooed full frontal exposure from leading man Willis, but the leads generate no sparks. I give Willis credit for a) generously stepping up to the plate and showing substantial skin at a time when most American mainstream leading men would have run in the opposite direction, and b) trying to play the lead role seriously, but he is positively lifeless in this film. One has no rooting interest in either his relationship with March, his ability to counsel his patients, or whether he will even make it out of the various chase/attack scenes in one piece. He has rendered himself into a virtual stick of wood devoid of any emotion. Yet, in spite of its miscast and outmatched leads and the thoroughly incompetent direction, the film has that car accident quality that keeps one watching well past the point where it should be turned off. The conclusion is pure Grand Guignol corn with a bit of a cheat on the murderer, but what an unintentionally hilarious loony ride it is to that point.

    I don't really see how this ever got a Razzie award, because it's way too middle of the road for that. It's a standard thriller with standard suspects and a standard yet pretty creative outcome. It's really unexceptional in every possible way, except maybe for the surprisingly tacky sex scenes and gratuitous nudity, which gives it kind of an exploitation feel. Not enough to call it bad. At some points the writing is also a bit forced. The makers noticed they hadn't had anything happening in ages so they threw in a car chase for some reason. Would the killer really take that kind of risk? Even though this movie has quite a lot of flaws, it actually does manage to be entertaining. The mystery stays exciting throughout and the ending does not disappoint. It's bizarre and unbelievable, but it does not disappoint. Overall I'd say this movie isn't nearly as bad as what some people seemed to believe.

    Color of Night is an erotic mystery thriller that stars Bruce Willis and Jane March.It is a story about New York psychiatrist Bill Capa,who visits Los Angeles to take over his murdered colleague's therapy group and then he finds himself embroiled in the thick of a mystery when he meets into Rosa,who happens to be an aspiring actress with a sexy overbite and hardly wearing any underwear,and they begin a torrid love affair. Richard Rush is the director of the film. The film has has much in the way of sex.Probably just a hairline away to finally avoid the dreaded NC-17. Still, there's plenty of sex scenes and nudity between Willis and March. Aside from that,the audience is treated to a plot itself seems too ridiculous to be taken seriously.There is a murder mystery involved and the following are the suspects:Clark,who suffers from severe obsessive compulsive disorder and insists on cleanliness and counting things whose temper caused him to beat up his wife;Sondra,a nymphomaniac and kleptomaniac who stabbed her father with a knife and fork and had a husband died of unnatural causes;Buck,a suicidal ex-cop whose wife and daughter's murders remains unsolved;Casey,an arrogant son of a wealthy man, paints sado-masochist works of art that once burned down his father's house; and finally Richie,a 16-year-old with social anxiety disorder, a stutter and gender identity disorder who wants to be a woman and has has a history of drug use. But viewers will identify the suspect an hour away before the movie ends. Overall,it is movie becomes awful as it tries to mix of black humor and clever plotting intelligently but was unable to do so.But watch it for the sex scenes alone.

    COLOR OF NIGHT is a dated, cheesy, film, a '90s misfire that attempted to ride the wave of psycho-sexual thrillers in the wake of FATAL ATTRACTION and BASIC INSTINCT and failed from the outset. The most annoying thing about the production is that the plot hinges on a crucial twist that will be obvious to even the most shortsighted viewer, right from the outset, but we're asked to suspend our disbelief until the very end before said twist is revealed. Nobody in their right mind can do that. Still, despite the paucity of imagination and the silliness of the script, watching this movie turns out to be quite a lot of fun. It's one of those films you can put into the so-bad-it's-good category of entertainment, in that it's filled with unintentional laughs and funny scenes that showcase some OTT acting from most of the cast. Whether it's Bruce Willis's hairpiece or the overblown pool sex scene (although Paul Verhoeven topped that a year later in SHOWGIRLS), COLOR OF NIGHT is frequently amusing. Besides, you have to give the film some credit for its cast alone, a seasoned who's who of '90s-era talent. I particularly like the way the casting director fixed up a bunch of well-known genre actors in supporting roles; well done that man! We're treated to non-bad-guy turns from Lance Henriksen and Brad Dourif (how often can you say that?), PREDATOR 2's Ruben Blades as the comic relief/detective, Lesley Ann Warren as a sex addict, a typically kooky Kevin J. O'Connor, and even Mr. QUANTUM LEAP himself, Scott Bakula. As for the central twosome, well...the best you can say is that this is when Willis was still acting in his roles, rather than riding along on monotonous autopilot as he does these days (in A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD, for instance). Jane March is pretty and alluring, but is she out of her depth in a psychologically complex part? I think so! Director Richard Rush started out making trash movies '60s and his mindset is evident in the cheesy stalk-n-slash sequences and overblown stylistics on offer here. COLOR OF NIGHT might be a trashy attempt at a thriller, but it's a fun one with it.

    Looking at the other reviews, this film is like marmite - you either like it or hate it! I liked it quite a lot. Bruce Willis is quite enjoyable - you could compare it to The Sixth Sense - he's a therapist in that one too. It's the kind of film where there are preposterous moments that make you smile, but there's enough good acting to outweigh that. Is it 'so bad, it's good'? - Yes at times it falls into that category - especially in the closing scenes. However, lots of credit to Jane March... call me slow on the uptake if you like, but I had no inkling that Ritchie/Rose are the same actress till the end. One thing that lets it down is the music - fairly corny at times, could have been much improved with a more original score. I think Dale should have risen one more time from the dead, to make it a truly 'so bad it's good' film!

    Two things happen at psychiatrist Bruce Willis' group therapy - one, he drops into a hot and heavy relationship with a tasty young thing and, two, patients start getting murdered. There are two ways of describing this movie. One is by applying the label "erotic thriller". The other is by describing it thus: ludicrous melodrama where half the characters remain at hysteria pitch throughout, and Bruce Willis reveals all in a series of sex scenes with Jane March who, despite getting her kit off frequently, fails to establish this as the breakthrough role it should have been given the scope of her character. This film is not un-entertaining, but it's for all the wrong reasons.

    This movie is most certainly not a masterpiece deserving of a perfect rating, but when I see a solid movie with ratings lower than some total trash I have no option but to overrate in order to contribute at least a little bit to what I think is a proper rating for a movie... That being said, this movie is actually a solid 7 in my book because it delivers a good plot without too many holes and without over-stretching my suspension of disbelief. It also delivers solid acting and well developed characters, including the support cast which is a rarity in modern Hollywood movies. In short, my feeling was that all the characters were played well, were believable and easy to connect with. Special kudos go to Jane March who is not only very beautiful and graceful in this role but pulls of a multiple personality role quite well in my opinion and is overall a pleasure to watch and this has nothing to do with the nude scenes which are just an added bonus for some of the audience... Finally, I suspect this movie is so poorly rated in part because of the aforementioned nudity as I noticed a trend in this regard with all the puritans racing to give a rating of 1/10 to any movie containing nudity.

    Color of Night is a very vibrant, colorful film with odd characters from the very beginning. The opening scenes are jarring leaving one trying to figure out just what exactly is going on. What is going to happen next? The acting by everyone is excellent. I think this is Bruce Willis' best acting yet. His character is very endearing and likable. In fact, all of the characters, as kooky as they may be, are likable here leaving an impression after seeing this. There are very clever split screen shots using mirrors so that we can see both characters during conversations. The film is overdone though. It becomes a bit too heavy-handed near the end and then we are left with an overdub from one of the characters that seems silly. Also, when we find out who the killer is the actor seems a little uncomfortable with his dialog. Not perfect by any means but very unique and very well shot. Almost feels like a Brian Depalma film. A mysterious thriller that pulls you in and keeps you interested.

    if u like campy movies like showgirls you will probably like this movie! now i admit there are a few plot holes and seeing Jane March in disguise is pretty obvious. but aside from that the acting of the cast is pretty good Jane March, and Lesley Ann Warren are particularly good and Ruben Blades is pretty funny as a wound way to tight inspector. Bruce Willis is about as good as he usually is. about the plot holes that red car pushing the car from the top of the parking garage trying to crush Willis didn't make much sense i don't know how the killer would know he was in that spot from way up there and Mrs. Niedelmeyer knowing about Ritchie's death doesn't make sense if dale covered it up. the film does however keep you guessing as to who the killer is. at first with march's obvious disguise you instantly suspect her however the film throws enough curve balls to evenly spread out the suspicion among the viewers. the film as a whole it is a great erotic thriller the sex scenes are so hot and the ending is probably one of the best twist endings I've seen in a while. sadly the poor march's poor disguise spoil the surprise however it is quite a cleaver idea i must give credit to the writers. so give it a chance if you don't think its a good movie you might at least see it as a so-bad-its-good movie you can enjoy.

    This film is extremely good. Of course, since it is a head shrink film, we can imagine the twisted denouement from the very beginning, that it will have to do with sexual identification or dis-identification, but at the same time it is done well enough for us to have some kind of doubts and follow the events the way they come and be surprised by the details of the horror of these perverted psychos. I won't give you the details because that would go against the confidentiality rule that I gave sworn to respect once I became an almighty reviewer, or critic. I do breach that sworn confidentiality all the time, but this time no, not at all. You can send Dexter and I won't do it either. I am not afraid of Dexter and anyway he will never be able to cut me into small pieces because I am protected the charm of my old years. If you want the details you'll have to watch the film. But make sure you know what's the difference between a boy and a girl and vice versa otherwise you may get slightly sick which would be your punishment since you had been warned.

Unfortunately the ham factor does not extend to the leads. March has been handed a virtually unplayable part filled with assorted pitfalls, and even the more remedial elements seem out of her reach. She never seems vampish enough to attract the kind of attention bestowed upon her in the film. Even worse, March's distinctive looks render a latter-film plot twist psychotically absurd when the audience has been leagues ahead of everyone else on screen and the respective characters' bafflement seems downright jaw-dropping. Much press was spilled about the torrid sex scenes compiled for the film, including much ballyhooed full frontal exposure from leading man Willis, but the leads generate no sparks. I give Willis credit for a) generously stepping up to the plate and showing substantial skin at a time when most American mainstream leading men would have run in the opposite direction, and b) trying to play the lead role seriously, but he is positively lifeless in this film. One has no rooting interest in either his relationship with March, his ability to counsel his patients, or whether he will even make it out of the various chase/attack scenes in one piece. He has rendered himself into a virtual stick of wood devoid of any emotion. Yet, in spite of its miscast and outmatched leads and the thoroughly incompetent direction, the film has that car accident quality that keeps one watching well past the point where it should be turned off. The conclusion is pure Grand Guignol corn with a bit of a cheat on the murderer, but what an unintentionally hilarious loony ride it is to that point.

    if u like campy movies like showgirls you will probably like this movie! now i admit there are a few plot holes and seeing Jane March in disguise is pretty obvious. but aside from that the acting of the cast is pretty good Jane March, and Lesley Ann Warren are particularly good and Ruben Blades is pretty funny as a wound way to tight inspector. Bruce Willis is about as good as he usually is. about the plot holes that red car pushing the car from the top of the parking garage trying to crush Willis didn't make much sense i don't know how the killer would know he was in that spot from way up there and Mrs. Niedelmeyer knowing about Ritchie's death doesn't make sense if dale covered it up. the film does however keep you guessing as to who the killer is. at first with march's obvious disguise you instantly suspect her however the film throws enough curve balls to evenly spread out the suspicion among the viewers. the film as a whole it is a great erotic thriller the sex scenes are so hot and the ending is probably one of the best twist endings I've seen in a while. sadly the poor march's poor disguise spoil the surprise however it is quite a cleaver idea i must give credit to the writers. so give it a chance if you don't think its a good movie you might at least see it as a so-bad-its-good movie you can enjoy.

    This film is extremely good. Of course, since it is a head shrink film, we can imagine the twisted denouement from the very beginning, that it will have to do with sexual identification or dis-identification, but at the same time it is done well enough for us to have some kind of doubts and follow the events the way they come and be surprised by the details of the horror of these perverted psychos. I won't give you the details because that would go against the confidentiality rule that I gave sworn to respect once I became an almighty reviewer, or critic. I do breach that sworn confidentiality all the time, but this time no, not at all. You can send Dexter and I won't do it either. I am not afraid of Dexter and anyway he will never be able to cut me into small pieces because I am protected the charm of my old years. If you want the details you'll have to watch the film. But make sure you know what's the difference between a boy and a girl and vice versa otherwise you may get slightly sick which would be your punishment since you had been warned. Enjoy that trip to Los Angeles, the perfectly well named city of angels. So many little angels are fluttering around our heads in this basically murderous city.

    The Color of Night is actually one of those rare achievements that no director or screenwriter could possibly strive for if they wanted to. A film that fails at pretty much everything it aspires, but manages to become compulsively viewable to see how much further a train wreck it can become and, by some strange twist, actually attains a level of guilty entertainment value it really does not deserve. Blending together the elements of a psychological Hitchcock thriller with the eroticism of Basic Instinct/Fatal Attraction/late night Cinemax films, the filmmakers end up with a conglomeration that was probably a far cry from what they intended, particularly given that director Richard Rush was actually a director of some reputation. Psychologist Bruce Willis has gone color blind since his inept attempts at counseling led to the unintentional suicide of a patient. He decides to seek solace with an old colleague Scott Bakula, who ends up murdered. Police seem to believe that the culprit is one of the participants of the group therapy sessions that Bakula oversaw and Willis steps in to ferret out the culprit. Meanwhile, Willis crosses paths with enigmatic young sexpot Jane March who may be more involved than he suspects. The group therapy sessions are a great source of unintentional comedy. Made up of fairly reliable character actors like Lance Henriksen, Kevin O'Connor and Lesley Ann Warren, all seem to realize that they are in glorified garbage and find intriguing ways in which to embellish their characters and hog the screen. In between, comical therapy sessions, Rush inserts an obligatory chase scene, a bloody murder, or an energetic sex romp between the leads. No one can ever accuse the film of being a bore. Unfortunately the ham factor does not extend to the leads. March has been handed a virtually unplayable part filled with assorted pitfalls, and even the more remedial elements seem out of her reach. She never seems vampish enough to attract the kind of attention bestowed upon her in the film. Even worse, March's distinctive looks render a latter-film plot twist psychotically absurd when the audience has been leagues ahead of everyone else on screen and the respective characters' bafflement seems downright jaw-dropping. Much press was spilled about the torrid sex scenes compiled for the film, including much ballyhooed full frontal exposure from leading man Willis, but the leads generate no sparks. I give Willis credit for a) generously stepping up to the plate and showing substantial skin at a time when most American mainstream leading men would have run in the opposite direction, and b) trying to play the lead role seriously, but he is positively lifeless in this film. One has no rooting interest in either his relationship with March, his ability to counsel his patients, or whether he will even make it out of the various chase/attack scenes in one piece. He has rendered himself into a virtual stick of wood devoid of any emotion. Yet, in spite of its miscast and outmatched leads and the thoroughly incompetent direction, the film has that car accident quality that keeps one watching well past the point where it should be turned off. The conclusion is pure Grand Guignol corn with a bit of a cheat on the murderer, but what an unintentionally hilarious loony ride it is to that point.

    I don't really see how this ever got a Razzie award, because it's way too middle of the road for that. It's a standard thriller with standard suspects and a standard yet pretty creative outcome. It's really unexceptional in every possible way, except maybe for the surprisingly tacky sex scenes and gratuitous nudity, which gives it kind of an exploitation feel. Not enough to call it bad. At some points the writing is also a bit forced. The makers noticed they hadn't had anything happening in ages so they threw in a car chase for some reason. Would the killer really take that kind of risk? Even though this movie has quite a lot of flaws, it actually does manage to be entertaining. The mystery stays exciting throughout and the ending does not disappoint. It's bizarre and unbelievable, but it does not disappoint. Overall I'd say this movie isn't nearly as bad as what some people seemed to believe.

    Color of Night is an erotic mystery thriller that stars Bruce Willis and Jane March.It is a story about New York psychiatrist Bill Capa,who visits Los Angeles to take over his murdered colleague's therapy group and then he finds himself embroiled in the thick of a mystery when he meets into Rosa,who happens to be an aspiring actress with a sexy overbite and hardly wearing any underwear,and they begin a torrid love affair. Richard Rush is the director of the film. The film has has much in the way of sex.Probably just a hairline away to finally avoid the dreaded NC-17. Still, there's plenty of sex scenes and nudity between Willis and March. Aside from that,the audience is treated to a plot itself seems too ridiculous to be taken seriously.There is a murder mystery involved and the following are the suspects:Clark,who suffers from severe obsessive compulsive disorder and insists on cleanliness and counting things whose temper caused him to beat up his wife;Sondra,a nymphomaniac and kleptomaniac who stabbed her father with a knife and fork and had a husband died of unnatural causes;Buck,a suicidal ex-cop whose wife and daughter's murders remains unsolved;Casey,an arrogant son of a wealthy man, paints sado-masochist works of art that once burned down his father's house; and finally Richie,a 16-year-old with social anxiety disorder, a stutter and gender identity disorder who wants to be a woman and has has a history of drug use. But viewers will identify the suspect an hour away before the movie ends. Overall,it is movie becomes awful as it tries to mix of black humor and clever plotting intelligently but was unable to do so.But watch it for the sex scenes alone.

    COLOR OF NIGHT is a dated, cheesy, film, a '90s misfire that attempted to ride the wave of psycho-sexual thrillers in the wake of FATAL ATTRACTION and BASIC INSTINCT and failed from the outset. The most annoying thing about the production is that the plot hinges on a crucial twist that will be obvious to even the most shortsighted viewer, right from the outset, but we're asked to suspend our disbelief until the very end before said twist is revealed. Nobody in their right mind can do that. Still, despite the paucity of imagination and the silliness of the script, watching this movie turns out to be quite a lot of fun. It's one of those films you can put into the so-bad-it's-good category of entertainment, in that it's filled with unintentional laughs and funny scenes that showcase some OTT acting from most of the cast. Whether it's Bruce Willis's hairpiece or the overblown pool sex scene (although Paul Verhoeven topped that a year later in SHOWGIRLS), COLOR OF NIGHT is frequently amusing. Besides, you have to give the film some credit for its cast alone, a seasoned who's who of '90s-era talent. I particularly like the way the casting director fixed up a bunch of well-known genre actors in supporting roles; well done that man! We're treated to non-bad-guy turns from Lance Henriksen and Brad Dourif (how often can you say that?), PREDATOR 2's Ruben Blades as the comic relief/detective, Lesley Ann Warren as a sex addict, a typically kooky Kevin J. O'Connor, and even Mr. QUANTUM LEAP himself, Scott Bakula. As for the central twosome, well...the best you can say is that this is when Willis was still acting in his roles, rather than riding along on monotonous autopilot as he does these days (in A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD, for instance). Jane March is pretty and alluring, but is she out of her depth in a psychologically complex part? I think so! Director Richard Rush started out making trash movies '60s and his mindset is evident in the cheesy stalk-n-slash sequences and overblown stylistics on offer here. COLOR OF NIGHT might be a trashy attempt at a thriller, but it's a fun one with it.

    Looking at the other reviews, this film is like marmite - you either like it or hate it! I liked it quite a lot. Bruce Willis is quite enjoyable - you could compare it to The Sixth Sense - he's a therapist in that one too. It's the kind of film where there are preposterous moments that make you smile, but there's enough good acting to outweigh that. Is it 'so bad, it's good'? - Yes at times it falls into that category - especially in the closing scenes. However, lots of credit to Jane March... call me slow on the uptake if you like, but I had no inkling that Ritchie/Rose are the same actress till the end. One thing that lets it down is the music - fairly corny at times, could have been much improved with a more original score. I think Dale should have risen one more time from the dead, to make it a truly 'so bad it's good' film!

    Two things happen at psychiatrist Bruce Willis' group therapy - one, he drops into a hot and heavy relationship with a tasty young thing and, two, patients start getting murdered. There are two ways of describing this movie. One is by applying the label "erotic thriller". The other is by describing it thus: ludicrous melodrama where half the characters remain at hysteria pitch throughout, and Bruce Willis reveals all in a series of sex scenes with Jane March who, despite getting her kit off frequently, fails to establish this as the breakthrough role it should have been given the scope of her character. This film is not un-entertaining, but it's for all the wrong reasons.

    This movie is most certainly not a masterpiece deserving of a perfect rating, but when I see a solid movie with ratings lower than some total trash I have no option but to overrate in order to contribute at least a little bit to what I think is a proper rating for a movie... That being said, this movie is actually a solid 7 in my book because it delivers a good plot without too many holes and without over-stretching my suspension of disbelief. It also delivers solid acting and well developed characters, including the support cast which is a rarity in modern Hollywood movies. In short, my feeling was that all the characters were played well, were believable and easy to connect with. Special kudos go to Jane March who is not only very beautiful and graceful in this role but pulls of a multiple personality role quite well in my opinion and is overall a pleasure to watch and this has nothing to do with the nude scenes which are just an added bonus for some of the audience... Finally, I suspect this movie is so poorly rated in part because of the aforementioned nudity as I noticed a trend in this regard with all the puritans racing to give a rating of 1/10 to any movie containing nudity.

    Color of Night is a very vibrant, colorful film with odd characters from the very beginning. The opening scenes are jarring leaving one trying to figure out just what exactly is going on. What is going to happen next? The acting by everyone is excellent. I think this is Bruce Willis' best acting yet. His character is very endearing and likable. In fact, all of the characters, as kooky as they may be, are likable here leaving an impression after seeing this. There are very clever split screen shots using mirrors so that we can see both characters during conversations. The film is overdone though. It becomes a bit too heavy-handed near the end and then we are left with an overdub from one of the characters that seems silly. Also, when we find out who the killer is the actor seems a little uncomfortable with his dialog. Not perfect by any means but very unique and very well shot. Almost feels like a Brian Depalma film. A mysterious thriller that pulls you in and keeps you interested.

    This film is extremely good. Of course, since it is a head shrink film, we can imagine the twisted denouement from the very beginning, that it will have to do with sexual identification or dis-identification, but at the same time it is done well enough for us to have some kind of doubts and follow the events the way they come and be surprised by the details of the horror of these perverted psychos. I won't give you the details because that would go against the confidentiality rule that I gave sworn to respect once I became an almighty reviewer, or critic.

    Color of Night is a very vibrant, colorful film with odd characters from the very beginning. The opening scenes are jarring leaving one trying to figure out just what exactly is going on. What is going to happen next? The acting by everyone is excellent. I think this is Bruce Willis' best acting yet. His character is very endearing and likable. In fact, all of the characters, as kooky as they may be, are likable here leaving an impression after seeing this. There are very clever split screen shots using mirrors so that we can see both characters during conversations. The film is overdone though. It becomes a bit too heavy-handed near the end and then we are left with an overdub from one of the characters that seems silly. Also, when we find out who the killer is the actor seems a little uncomfortable with his dialog. Not perfect by any means but very unique and very well shot. Almost feels like a Brian Depalma film. A mysterious thriller that pulls you in and keeps you interested.

    if u like campy movies like showgirls you will probably like this movie! now i admit there are a few plot holes and seeing Jane March in disguise is pretty obvious. but aside from that the acting of the cast is pretty good Jane March, and Lesley Ann Warren are particularly good and Ruben Blades is pretty funny as a wound way to tight inspector. Bruce Willis is about as good as he usually is. about the plot holes that red car pushing the car from the top of the parking garage trying to crush Willis didn't make much sense i don't know how the killer would know he was in that spot from way up there and Mrs. Niedelmeyer knowing about Ritchie's death doesn't make sense if dale covered it up. the film does however keep you guessing as to who the killer is. at first with march's obvious disguise you instantly suspect her however the film throws enough curve balls to evenly spread out the suspicion among the viewers. the film as a whole it is a great erotic thriller the sex scenes are so hot and the ending is probably one of the best twist endings I've seen in a while. sadly the poor march's poor disguise spoil the surprise however it is quite a cleaver idea i must give credit to the writers. so give it a chance if you don't think its a good movie you might at least see it as a so-bad-its-good movie you can enjoy.

    This film is extremely good. Of course, since it is a head shrink film, we can imagine the twisted denouement from the very beginning, that it will have to do with sexual identification or dis-identification, but at the same time it is done well enough for us to have some kind of doubts and follow the events the way they come and be surprised by the details of the horror of these perverted psychos. I won't give you the details because that would go against the confidentiality rule that I gave sworn to respect once I became an almighty reviewer, or critic. I do breach that sworn confidentiality all the time, but this time no, not at all. You can send Dexter and I won't do it either. I am not afraid of Dexter and anyway he will never be able to cut me into small pieces because I am protected the charm of my old years. If you want the details you'll have to watch the film. But make sure you know what's the difference between a boy and a girl and vice versa otherwise you may get slightly sick which would be your punishment since you had been warned. Enjoy that trip to Los Angeles, the perfectly well named city of angels. So many little angels are fluttering around our heads in this basically murderous city.

    The Color of Night is actually one of those rare achievements that no director or screenwriter could possibly strive for if they wanted to. A film that fails at pretty much everything it aspires, but manages to become compulsively viewable to see how much further a train wreck it can become and, by some strange twist, actually attains a level of guilty entertainment value it really does not deserve. Blending together the elements of a psychological Hitchcock thriller with the eroticism of Basic Instinct/Fatal Attraction/late night Cinemax films, the filmmakers end up with a conglomeration that was probably a far cry from what they intended, particularly given that director Richard Rush was actually a director of some reputation. Psychologist Bruce Willis has gone color blind since his inept attempts at counseling led to the unintentional suicide of a patient. He decides to seek solace with an old colleague Scott Bakula, who ends up murdered. Police seem to believe that the culprit is one of the participants of the group therapy sessions that Bakula oversaw and Willis steps in to ferret out the culprit. Meanwhile, Willis crosses paths with enigmatic young sexpot Jane March who may be more involved than he suspects. The group therapy sessions are a great source of unintentional comedy. Made up of fairly reliable character actors like Lance Henriksen, Kevin O'Connor and Lesley Ann Warren, all seem to realize that they are in glorified garbage and find intriguing ways in which to embellish their characters and hog the screen. In between, comical therapy sessions, Rush inserts an obligatory chase scene, a bloody murder, or an energetic sex romp between the leads. No one can ever accuse the film of being a bore. Unfortunately the ham factor does not extend to the leads. March has been handed a virtually unplayable part filled with assorted pitfalls, and even the more remedial elements seem out of her reach. She never seems vampish enough to attract the kind of attention bestowed upon her in the film. Even worse, March's distinctive looks render a latter-film plot twist psychotically absurd when the audience has been leagues ahead of everyone else on screen and the respective characters' bafflement seems downright jaw-dropping. Much press was spilled about the torrid sex scenes compiled for the film, including much ballyhooed full frontal exposure from leading man Willis, but the leads generate no sparks. I give Willis credit for a) generously stepping up to the plate and showing substantial skin at a time when most American mainstream leading men would have run in the opposite direction, and b) trying to play the lead role seriously, but he is positively lifeless in this film. One has no rooting interest in either his relationship with March, his ability to counsel his patients, or whether he will even make it out of the various chase/attack scenes in one piece. He has rendered himself into a virtual stick of wood devoid of any emotion. Yet, in spite of its miscast and outmatched leads and the thoroughly incompetent direction, the film has that car accident quality that keeps one watching well past the point where it should be turned off. The conclusion is pure Grand Guignol corn with a bit of a cheat on the murderer, but what an unintentionally hilarious loony ride it is to that point.

    I don't really see how this ever got a Razzie award, because it's way too middle of the road for that. It's a standard thriller with standard suspects and a standard yet pretty creative outcome. It's really unexceptional in every possible way, except maybe for the surprisingly tacky sex scenes and gratuitous nudity, which gives it kind of an exploitation feel. Not enough to call it bad. At some points the writing is also a bit forced. The makers noticed they hadn't had anything happening in ages so they threw in a car chase for some reason. Would the killer really take that kind of risk? Even though this movie has quite a lot of flaws, it actually does manage to be entertaining. The mystery stays exciting throughout and the ending does not disappoint. It's bizarre and unbelievable, but it does not disappoint. Overall I'd say this movie isn't nearly as bad as what some people seemed to believe.

    Color of Night is an erotic mystery thriller that stars Bruce Willis and Jane March.It is a story about New York psychiatrist Bill Capa,who visits Los Angeles to take over his murdered colleague's therapy group and then he finds himself embroiled in the thick of a mystery when he meets into Rosa,who happens to be an aspiring actress with a sexy overbite and hardly wearing any underwear,and they begin a torrid love affair. Richard Rush is the director of the film. The film has has much in the way of sex.Probably just a hairline away to finally avoid the dreaded NC-17. Still, there's plenty of sex scenes and nudity between Willis and March. Aside from that,the audience is treated to a plot itself seems too ridiculous to be taken seriously.There is a murder mystery involved and the following are the suspects:Clark,who suffers from severe obsessive compulsive disorder and insists on cleanliness and counting things whose temper caused him to beat up his wife;Sondra,a nymphomaniac and kleptomaniac who stabbed her father with a knife and fork and had a husband died of unnatural causes;Buck,a suicidal ex-cop whose wife and daughter's murders remains unsolved;Casey,an arrogant son of a wealthy man, paints sado-masochist works of art that once burned down his father's house; and finally Richie,a 16-year-old with social anxiety disorder, a stutter and gender identity disorder who wants to be a woman and has has a history of drug use. But viewers will identify the suspect an hour away before the movie ends. Overall,it is movie becomes awful as it tries to mix of black humor and clever plotting intelligently but was unable to do so.But watch it for the sex scenes alone.

    COLOR OF NIGHT is a dated, cheesy, film, a '90s misfire that attempted to ride the wave of psycho-sexual thrillers in the wake of FATAL ATTRACTION and BASIC INSTINCT and failed from the outset. The most annoying thing about the production is that the plot hinges on a crucial twist that will be obvious to even the most shortsighted viewer, right from the outset, but we're asked to suspend our disbelief until the very end before said twist is revealed. Nobody in their right mind can do that. Still, despite the paucity of imagination and the silliness of the script, watching this movie turns out to be quite a lot of fun. It's one of those films you can put into the so-bad-it's-good category of entertainment, in that it's filled with unintentional laughs and funny scenes that showcase some OTT acting from most of the cast. Whether it's Bruce Willis's hairpiece or the overblown pool sex scene (although Paul Verhoeven topped that a year later in SHOWGIRLS), COLOR OF NIGHT is frequently amusing. Besides, you have to give the film some credit for its cast alone, a seasoned who's who of '90s-era talent. I particularly like the way the casting director fixed up a bunch of well-known genre actors in supporting roles; well done that man! We're treated to non-bad-guy turns from Lance Henriksen and Brad Dourif (how often can you say that?), PREDATOR 2's Ruben Blades as the comic relief/detective, Lesley Ann Warren as a sex addict, a typically kooky Kevin J. O'Connor, and even Mr. QUANTUM LEAP himself, Scott Bakula. As for the central twosome, well...the best you can say is that this is when Willis was still acting in his roles, rather than riding along on monotonous autopilot as he does these days (in A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD, for instance). Jane March is pretty and alluring, but is she out of her depth in a psychologically complex part? I think so! Director Richard Rush started out making trash movies '60s and his mindset is evident in the cheesy stalk-n-slash sequences and overblown stylistics on offer here. COLOR OF NIGHT might be a trashy attempt at a thriller, but it's a fun one with it.

    Looking at the other reviews, this film is like marmite - you either like it or hate it! I liked it quite a lot. Bruce Willis is quite enjoyable - you could compare it to The Sixth Sense - he's a therapist in that one too. It's the kind of film where there are preposterous moments that make you smile, but there's enough good acting to outweigh that. Is it 'so bad, it's good'? - Yes at times it falls into that category - especially in the closing scenes. However, lots of credit to Jane March... call me slow on the uptake if you like, but I had no inkling that Ritchie/Rose are the same actress till the end. One thing that lets it down is the music - fairly corny at times, could have been much improved with a more original score. I think Dale should have risen one more time from the dead, to make it a truly 'so bad it's good' film!

    Two things happen at psychiatrist Bruce Willis' group therapy - one, he drops into a hot and heavy relationship with a tasty young thing and, two, patients start getting murdered. There are two ways of describing this movie. One is by applying the label "erotic thriller". The other is by describing it thus: ludicrous melodrama where half the characters remain at hysteria pitch throughout, and Bruce Willis reveals all in a series of sex scenes with Jane March who, despite getting her kit off frequently, fails to establish this as the breakthrough role it should have been given the scope of her character. This film is not un-entertaining, but it's for all the wrong reasons.

    This movie is most certainly not a masterpiece deserving of a perfect rating, but when I see a solid movie with ratings lower than some total trash I have no option but to overrate in order to contribute at least a little bit to what I think is a proper rating for a movie... That being said, this movie is actually a solid 7 in my book because it delivers a good plot without too many holes and without over-stretching my suspension of disbelief. It also delivers solid acting and well developed characters, including the support cast which is a rarity in modern Hollywood movies. In short, my feeling was that all the characters were played well, were believable and easy to connect with. Special kudos go to Jane March who is not only very beautiful and graceful in this role but pulls of a multiple personality role quite well in my opinion and is overall a pleasure to watch and this has nothing to do with the nude scenes which are just an added bonus for some of the audience... Finally, I suspect this movie is so poorly rated in part because of the aforementioned nudity as I noticed a trend in this regard with all the puritans racing to give a rating of 1/10 to any movie containing nudity.

This film is not un-entertaining, but it's for all the wrong reasons.

    This movie is most certainly not a masterpiece deserving of a perfect rating, but when I see a solid movie with ratings lower than some total trash I have no option but to overrate in order to contribute at least a little bit to what I think is a proper rating for a movie... That being said, this movie is actually a solid 7 in my book because it delivers a good plot without too many holes and without over-stretching my suspension of disbelief. It also delivers solid acting and well developed characters, including the support cast which is a rarity in modern Hollywood movies. In short, my feeling was that all the characters were played well, were believable and easy to connect with. Special kudos go to Jane March who is not only very beautiful and graceful in this role but pulls of a multiple personality role quite well in my opinion and is overall a pleasure to watch and this has nothing to do with the nude scenes which are just an added bonus for some of the audience... Finally, I suspect this movie is so poorly rated in part because of the aforementioned nudity as I noticed a trend in this regard with all the puritans racing to give a rating of 1/10 to any movie containing nudity.

    Color of Night is a very vibrant, colorful film with odd characters from the very beginning. The opening scenes are jarring leaving one trying to figure out just what exactly is going on. What is going to happen next? The acting by everyone is excellent. I think this is Bruce Willis' best acting yet. His character is very endearing and likable. In fact, all of the characters, as kooky as they may be, are likable here leaving an impression after seeing this. There are very clever split screen shots using mirrors so that we can see both characters during conversations. The film is overdone though. It becomes a bit too heavy-handed near the end and then we are left with an overdub from one of the characters that seems silly. Also, when we find out who the killer is the actor seems a little uncomfortable with his dialog. Not perfect by any means but very unique and very well shot. Almost feels like a Brian Depalma film. A mysterious thriller that pulls you in and keeps you interested.

    if u like campy movies like showgirls you will probably like this movie! now i admit there are a few plot holes and seeing Jane March in disguise is pretty obvious. but aside from that the acting of the cast is pretty good Jane March, and Lesley Ann Warren are particularly good and Ruben Blades is pretty funny as a wound way to tight inspector. Bruce Willis is about as good as he usually is. about the plot holes that red car pushing the car from the top of the parking garage trying to crush Willis didn't make much sense i don't know how the killer would know he was in that spot from way up there and Mrs. Niedelmeyer knowing about Ritchie's death doesn't make sense if dale covered it up. the film does however keep you guessing as to who the killer is. at first with march's obvious disguise you instantly suspect her however the film throws enough curve balls to evenly spread out the suspicion among the viewers. the film as a whole it is a great erotic thriller the sex scenes are so hot and the ending is probably one of the best twist endings I've seen in a while. sadly the poor march's poor disguise spoil the surprise however it is quite a cleaver idea i must give credit to the writers. so give it a chance if you don't think its a good movie you might at least see it as a so-bad-its-good movie you can enjoy.

    This film is extremely good. Of course, since it is a head shrink film, we can imagine the twisted denouement from the very beginning, that it will have to do with sexual identification or dis-identification, but at the same time it is done well enough for us to have some kind of doubts and follow the events the way they come and be surprised by the details of the horror of these perverted psychos. I won't give you the details because that would go against the confidentiality rule that I gave sworn to respect once I became an almighty reviewer, or critic. I do breach that sworn confidentiality all the time, but this time no, not at all. You can send Dexter and I won't do it either. I am not afraid of Dexter and anyway he will never be able to cut me into small pieces because I am protected the charm of my old years. If you want the details you'll have to watch the film. But make sure you know what's the difference between a boy and a girl and vice versa otherwise you may get slightly sick which would be your punishment since you had been warned. Enjoy that trip to Los Angeles, the perfectly well named city of angels. So many little angels are fluttering around our heads in this basically murderous city.

    The Color of Night is actually one of those rare achievements that no director or screenwriter could possibly strive for if they wanted to. A film that fails at pretty much everything it aspires, but manages to become compulsively viewable to see how much further a train wreck it can become and, by some strange twist, actually attains a level of guilty entertainment value it really does not deserve. Blending together the elements of a psychological Hitchcock thriller with the eroticism of Basic Instinct/Fatal Attraction/late night Cinemax films, the filmmakers end up with a conglomeration that was probably a far cry from what they intended, particularly given that director Richard Rush was actually a director of some reputation. Psychologist Bruce Willis has gone color blind since his inept attempts at counseling led to the unintentional suicide of a patient. He decides to seek solace with an old colleague Scott Bakula, who ends up murdered. Police seem to believe that the culprit is one of the participants of the group therapy sessions that Bakula oversaw and Willis steps in to ferret out the culprit. Meanwhile, Willis crosses paths with enigmatic young sexpot Jane March who may be more involved than he suspects. The group therapy sessions are a great source of unintentional comedy. Made up of fairly reliable character actors like Lance Henriksen, Kevin O'Connor and Lesley Ann Warren, all seem to realize that they are in glorified garbage and find intriguing ways in which to embellish their characters and hog the screen. In between, comical therapy sessions, Rush inserts an obligatory chase scene, a bloody murder, or an energetic sex romp between the leads. No one can ever accuse the film of being a bore. Unfortunately the ham factor does not extend to the leads. March has been handed a virtually unplayable part filled with assorted pitfalls, and even the more remedial elements seem out of her reach. She never seems vampish enough to attract the kind of attention bestowed upon her in the film. Even worse, March's distinctive looks render a latter-film plot twist psychotically absurd when the audience has been leagues ahead of everyone else on screen and the respective characters' bafflement seems downright jaw-dropping. Much press was spilled about the torrid sex scenes compiled for the film, including much ballyhooed full frontal exposure from leading man Willis, but the leads generate no sparks. I give Willis credit for a) generously stepping up to the plate and showing substantial skin at a time when most American mainstream leading men would have run in the opposite direction, and b) trying to play the lead role seriously, but he is positively lifeless in this film. One has no rooting interest in either his relationship with March, his ability to counsel his patients, or whether he will even make it out of the various chase/attack scenes in one piece. He has rendered himself into a virtual stick of wood devoid of any emotion. Yet, in spite of its miscast and outmatched leads and the thoroughly incompetent direction, the film has that car accident quality that keeps one watching well past the point where it should be turned off. The conclusion is pure Grand Guignol corn with a bit of a cheat on the murderer, but what an unintentionally hilarious loony ride it is to that point.

    I don't really see how this ever got a Razzie award, because it's way too middle of the road for that. It's a standard thriller with standard suspects and a standard yet pretty creative outcome. It's really unexceptional in every possible way, except maybe for the surprisingly tacky sex scenes and gratuitous nudity, which gives it kind of an exploitation feel. Not enough to call it bad. At some points the writing is also a bit forced. The makers noticed they hadn't had anything happening in ages so they threw in a car chase for some reason. Would the killer really take that kind of risk? Even though this movie has quite a lot of flaws, it actually does manage to be entertaining. The mystery stays exciting throughout and the ending does not disappoint. It's bizarre and unbelievable, but it does not disappoint. Overall I'd say this movie isn't nearly as bad as what some people seemed to believe.
