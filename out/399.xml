 <storyline>
  The three best of the disbanded Musketeers - Athos, Porthos, and Aramis - join a young hotheaded would-be-Musketeer, D'Artagnan, to stop the Cardinal Richelieu's evil plot: to form an alliance with enemy England by way of the mysterious Milady. Rochefort, the Cardinal's right-hand man, announces the official disbanding of the King's Musketeers. Three, however, refuse to throw down their swords - Athos the fighter and drinker, Porthos the pirate and lover, and Aramis the priest and poet. Arriving in Paris to join the Musketeers, D'Artagnan uncovers the Cardinal's plans, and the four set out on a mission to protect King and Country.

    OK, this isn't actually the fab cartoon series Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds, but Stephen Herek's Disney film is basically a live action cartoon. Starring Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland, Chris O'Donnell and Oliver Platt as Aramis-Athos-D'Artagnan and Porthos respectively, story is a fictional load of guff involving Tim Curry's evil Cardinal Richelieu trying to usurp Hugh O'Conor's King Louis XIII of France. Enter the last remaining Musketeers, sworn to serve their King, who after being joined by D'Artagnan set about foiling dastardly plans whilst admiring heaving bosoms. There's a couple of half decent sword fighting scenes, the photography (Dean Semler) and costuming is first rate, and undeniably there's a sense of fun about the whole thing; even if some of it is not intentional. But it's a pretty flat experience as valid entertainment, almost every casting decision is wrong, with O'Donnell and Sheen ridiculous beyond belief, the plot is wafer thin, the dialogue awful and the running time is padded out with music that hinders rather than enhances the pic. Michael Wincott (Captain Rochefort) and Rebecca De Mornay's (Milady De Winter/Sabine) breasts come out of the production in credit, but really you should seek out the Muskehounds as a better alternative for cartoon swordery. 4/10

    What's good? I guess the setup, dresses and production was OK. What's bad? Well, almost everything else. The melodrama, the deep emotions, the compelling story.. it's a bit like drinking old whiskey with coke. Gives you the hickup but doesn't satisfy your thirst. Unlike somebody else, who gave this piece of crap one star, I do give it four - for the reasons mentioned above. Cardinal Richelieu is perhaps the best character in the whole story, but the biggest failure here is that Disney had to chew it all down to little pretty pieces for kids to digest. I believe children can handle a bit more, but the Three Musketeers was never meant for children anyway. I think I will next try to find the best french version of this and hope it might live up to the original story better. So far the absolutely best movie version of this story has been the late 30's one with Gene Kelly. Check out how EFFORTLESSLY he jumps 4-5 meters during the duel scene around the pond.. but then he was physically far superior to O'Donnell, who is all buff but not really fast or explosive in any way whatsoever.

    Yes, there are liberties taken with the plot lines - the worst being Cardinal Richelieu thinking he could be King. But heyho Alan Rickman as Sheriff of Nottingham in Kev's 'Robin Hood' was trying it on the same, and had less chance than the Grey Eminence. Hollywood does take terrible liberties with European classics, just like Abe Lincoln, Vampire Slayer!!! The film is cheeky in tone, with plenty of swordfighting, derring do and love betrayed, but it does not quite shirk the state terror of executing Milady! The end is dragged out rather but the acting is pretty good and the storyline lollops along nicely. It is trying to emulate Dick Lester's version but comes up short against a really fine film that gets the balance of staying true to the book and getting plenty of laughs - remember Charlton Heston as Richelieu talking to Raquel Welch's husband played by Spike Milligan!!!!!!!!!! - Priceless. Enjoyable romp if you don't mind the changes to storyline and Tim Curry's overacting.

    My wife and I sat and watched this movie the other night. Considering that it is almost twenty years old, it is an enjoyable, easy to follow adventure story. Seeing Charlie Sheen and Sutherland in so young of roles almost makes you wish that you did know some of the negative aspects of their older lives. Overall, this movie is fun. The one-liners are hilarious and even though my wife could predict them, you still laugh when you hear them. Oliver Platt does a lot scene stealing with his antics, but in the course of the humor, you forgive him. For those who want a serious adaptation of the original book, this movie is not for you. For you historians who want French history, you better cover your eyes. But for those want some good entertainment and a few laughs, this movie is for you. Grade: B+

    Lightheaded and lighthearted this is the definition of escapist entertainment and that is meant as a compliment. Something to watch when you want to relax and not have to think about the plot of the movie. Chris O'Donnell is impish if a bit callow in the lead but the real show is musketeers anyway and there is where the movie excels. Keifer is suitably brooding as Athos and Charlie Sheen, before he became a surly twitchy mess, is a charming Aramis. The standout however is Oliver Platt going full on ham as Porthos giving a delightfully over the top performance and walking off with the picture whenever he is on screen. Rebecca De Mornay also seems to be having a good time enacting the villainous Milady de Winter, she's sexy and silky. Lastly there is Tim Curry positively consuming the scenery as Cardinal Richelieu, in his flowing red robes he and Oliver Platt are in a dead heat for biggest scene stealer. The production is high class with vibrant with color and beautiful settings, true it bears only a passing kinship with the source book but it is a fun time with lots of action and a carefree mood.

    After seeing almost every version of The Three Musketeers i watched this version expecting to be bored to death. But how can a movie with Tim Curry and Charlie Sheen be boring ? This version was fun to watch from start to finish even though it had some bad choices ( Hugh' O'Connor, Chris O'Donnell) the storyline was OK and the acting brilliant. Athos , Porthos and Aramis were finally portrayed by good actors and Curry was a scheming bastard but funny at the same time.I still have to see a good D'Artagnan and this still wasn't it , O'Donnell came out and the least important character and his acting didn't help. All in all, a fun version and i hoped it would be the last but it looks like i was wrong. Too bad they didn't the Man in the Iron Mask with these actors, it would have been hilarious and we wouldn't have to see the DiCaprio version with some has beens Musketeers.

For one Wincott pays the second in command villain, and Bryan Adams provides the 'big' song. Whilst it's nowhere near as fun as the aforementioned movie,it still has it's moments and the titular characters are a hoot whenever they are together on screen. O' Donnell on the other hand is the kiss of death for this movie, and ruins every scene he's in. It just goes to show that 'scent of a woman' was a one trick pony. Luckily Sheen, Sutherland and Platt share most of his scenes and over shadow him at all times. Curry is crazily fun as the Cardinal and just keeps the ham and cheese light. Other characters are wasted, and annoying, but the last third of the film ups the action ante and makes the whole thing worth sitting through. Just.

    Now this is a true Three Musketeers movie. I grew up absolutely loving this film to virtually no end. No other version compares to it. We all know the story: The treacherous Cardinal Richelieu (Tim Currey) plots to overthrow the king of France by disbanding his guard, the musketeers, and forming an alliance with the Duke of Bukingham. With the the help of the one-eyed Captain Rochefort (Michael Wincott) and the deadly Countess DeWinter (Rebecca De Mornay), it seems that the Cardinal is unstoppable. Luckily, the three musketeers stand in his way. With the help of the young and cocky D'Artagnan (Chris O'Donnell), Athos (Kiefer Sutherland), Porthos (Oliver Platt), and Aramis (Charles Sheen) shall cut down evil and save all of France. This movie has all the charm, action, drama, and comedy mixed with an all-star cast. The villains are delightfully despicable the way they play around with the thoughts and actions of all the clueless people around them. The musketeers are truly unique: Athos having the tendency to be serious, Porthos being the comical ladies man with all kinds of crazy weapons, and Aramis as a mild mannered priest. D'Artagnan is a bit stubborn to a fault, but he's still pretty good. Definitely superior to every other movie adaptation. Check out this wonderful adventure.

    There are about 130+ reviews on this film and while I have not read every single one, I have read a handful. What I am about to say may have already been stated by someone else, but like I said, I have not read every single review. The reviews that I did happen to look through were quite critical of the film. The most popular critique was that it was not an accurate adaptation of Alexander Dumas' novel. I am hear to tell you that that's the point. This version of The Three Musketeers was never about being an accurate adaptation. While it highlights key components of the story and some history (like who the Musketeers were, etc) it was meant to focus more on (to quote Charlie Sheen on the Behind the Scenes on the DVD) "the camaraderie. the essence of brotherhood." I also noticed people complaining it's not a family film. Of course it's not. It's not just Disney it's also a Touchstone film. Yes, I know Disney (either owns or is merged with Touchstone. Something like that.) Either way, it doesn't have to be strictly the Disney we know. So if you're looking for a more accurate adaptation of the novel then this film is not for you. I would recommend one of the versions that was created before 1993. I think the one made sometime in the 40s is more accurate and I believe the one from the 70s may also be more accurate for certain people's tastes.

    Worse Version of The Three Musketeers

    I got one word for this movie: Stupid! Just flat out, plain stupid! Overall, this was a very entertaining and it had the moments, but I have to say it was one of the worst versions of The Three Musketeers ever and I hope this latest version of The Three Musketeers is better. The plot in this movie did not follow the original plot and there was not enough dialogue between some very important characters from the book. Yes, this movie is meant for entertaining the kids and family, and I will admit there were a couple of times where I laughed at it, but that was mostly because of how stupid and inaccurate the screen writer made the movie. The whole plot is where the Cardinal, who is portrayed as an evil, merciless man, dismisses the musketeers as the king's bodyguards so the musketeers wouldn't be in the way of his evil plan to become king and in comes D'Artagnan who is just itching to be a musketeer like his father finds out about the Cardinal's plot so he and the three musketeers have to go and stop the evil plot. D'Artagnan is a naive and hot-headed little boy and perhaps a bit stupid; Athos is a brave drunk; Aramis is a humble, religious man yet a seducer(?); and Porthos is an arrogant womanizer and a pirate?!?!?! Where exactly did the pirate come from? When D'Artagnan found out Porthos was a pirate, he was actually AMAZED by it! Amazed by it? If D'Artagnan ever first found this out in the first place, he would not even step a foot near Porthos again! Did Disney even know back then that if you were found out to be a pirate or associating yourself with a pirate, you would be hanged?!?!?!?!?! Obviously not! They just think that everything they do in this movie is possible, even with a pirate being able to be a musketeer, not to mention a religious man such as Aramis being a seducer! And where exactly did the ninja come from? This takes place in the 17th century in France, so how exactly does the ninja fit in this movie? If this was a ninja or samurai version of The Three Musketeers, then maybe I would find the ninja believable, but since this is NOT a ninja or samurai version of The Three Musketeers, then I would have to say that Disney did a pretty poor job at creating this movie! The movie was entertaining, but just stupid. Do yourselves and your kids a favor, don't have them watch this horrible crap because it just gives them the wrong idea on the actual historic figures and facts.

I would recommend one of the versions that was created before 1993. I think the one made sometime in the 40s is more accurate and I believe the one from the 70s may also be more accurate for certain people's tastes.

    I got one word for this movie: Stupid! Just flat out, plain stupid! Overall, this was a very entertaining and it had the moments, but I have to say it was one of the worst versions of The Three Musketeers ever and I hope this latest version of The Three Musketeers is better. The plot in this movie did not follow the original plot and there was not enough dialogue between some very important characters from the book. Yes, this movie is meant for entertaining the kids and family, and I will admit there were a couple of times where I laughed at it, but that was mostly because of how stupid and inaccurate the screen writer made the movie. The whole plot is where the Cardinal, who is portrayed as an evil, merciless man, dismisses the musketeers as the king's bodyguards so the musketeers wouldn't be in the way of his evil plan to become king and in comes D'Artagnan who is just itching to be a musketeer like his father finds out about the Cardinal's plot so he and the three musketeers have to go and stop the evil plot. D'Artagnan is a naive and hot-headed little boy and perhaps a bit stupid; Athos is a brave drunk; Aramis is a humble, religious man yet a seducer(?); and Porthos is an arrogant womanizer and a pirate?!?!?! Where exactly did the pirate come from? When D'Artagnan found out Porthos was a pirate, he was actually AMAZED by it! Amazed by it? If D'Artagnan ever first found this out in the first place, he would not even step a foot near Porthos again! Did Disney even know back then that if you were found out to be a pirate or associating yourself with a pirate, you would be hanged?!?!?!?!?! Obviously not! They just think that everything they do in this movie is possible, even with a pirate being able to be a musketeer, not to mention a religious man such as Aramis being a seducer! And where exactly did the ninja come from? This takes place in the 17th century in France, so how exactly does the ninja fit in this movie? If this was a ninja or samurai version of The Three Musketeers, then maybe I would find the ninja believable, but since this is NOT a ninja or samurai version of The Three Musketeers, then I would have to say that Disney did a pretty poor job at creating this movie! The movie was entertaining, but just stupid. Do yourselves and your kids a favor, don't have them watch this horrible crap because it just gives them the wrong idea on the actual historic figures and facts.

    OK, this isn't actually the fab cartoon series Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds, but Stephen Herek's Disney film is basically a live action cartoon. Starring Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland, Chris O'Donnell and Oliver Platt as Aramis-Athos-D'Artagnan and Porthos respectively, story is a fictional load of guff involving Tim Curry's evil Cardinal Richelieu trying to usurp Hugh O'Conor's King Louis XIII of France. Enter the last remaining Musketeers, sworn to serve their King, who after being joined by D'Artagnan set about foiling dastardly plans whilst admiring heaving bosoms. There's a couple of half decent sword fighting scenes, the photography (Dean Semler) and costuming is first rate, and undeniably there's a sense of fun about the whole thing; even if some of it is not intentional. But it's a pretty flat experience as valid entertainment, almost every casting decision is wrong, with O'Donnell and Sheen ridiculous beyond belief, the plot is wafer thin, the dialogue awful and the running time is padded out with music that hinders rather than enhances the pic. Michael Wincott (Captain Rochefort) and Rebecca De Mornay's (Milady De Winter/Sabine) breasts come out of the production in credit, but really you should seek out the Muskehounds as a better alternative for cartoon swordery. 4/10

    What's good? I guess the setup, dresses and production was OK. What's bad? Well, almost everything else. The melodrama, the deep emotions, the compelling story.. it's a bit like drinking old whiskey with coke. Gives you the hickup but doesn't satisfy your thirst. Unlike somebody else, who gave this piece of crap one star, I do give it four - for the reasons mentioned above. Cardinal Richelieu is perhaps the best character in the whole story, but the biggest failure here is that Disney had to chew it all down to little pretty pieces for kids to digest. I believe children can handle a bit more, but the Three Musketeers was never meant for children anyway. I think I will next try to find the best french version of this and hope it might live up to the original story better. So far the absolutely best movie version of this story has been the late 30's one with Gene Kelly. Check out how EFFORTLESSLY he jumps 4-5 meters during the duel scene around the pond.. but then he was physically far superior to O'Donnell, who is all buff but not really fast or explosive in any way whatsoever.

    Yes, there are liberties taken with the plot lines - the worst being Cardinal Richelieu thinking he could be King. But heyho Alan Rickman as Sheriff of Nottingham in Kev's 'Robin Hood' was trying it on the same, and had less chance than the Grey Eminence. Hollywood does take terrible liberties with European classics, just like Abe Lincoln, Vampire Slayer!!! The film is cheeky in tone, with plenty of swordfighting, derring do and love betrayed, but it does not quite shirk the state terror of executing Milady! The end is dragged out rather but the acting is pretty good and the storyline lollops along nicely. It is trying to emulate Dick Lester's version but comes up short against a really fine film that gets the balance of staying true to the book and getting plenty of laughs - remember Charlton Heston as Richelieu talking to Raquel Welch's husband played by Spike Milligan!!!!!!!!!! - Priceless. Enjoyable romp if you don't mind the changes to storyline and Tim Curry's overacting.

    My wife and I sat and watched this movie the other night. Considering that it is almost twenty years old, it is an enjoyable, easy to follow adventure story. Seeing Charlie Sheen and Sutherland in so young of roles almost makes you wish that you did know some of the negative aspects of their older lives. Overall, this movie is fun. The one-liners are hilarious and even though my wife could predict them, you still laugh when you hear them. Oliver Platt does a lot scene stealing with his antics, but in the course of the humor, you forgive him. For those who want a serious adaptation of the original book, this movie is not for you. For you historians who want French history, you better cover your eyes. But for those want some good entertainment and a few laughs, this movie is for you. Grade: B+

    Lightheaded and lighthearted this is the definition of escapist entertainment and that is meant as a compliment. Something to watch when you want to relax and not have to think about the plot of the movie. Chris O'Donnell is impish if a bit callow in the lead but the real show is musketeers anyway and there is where the movie excels. Keifer is suitably brooding as Athos and Charlie Sheen, before he became a surly twitchy mess, is a charming Aramis. The standout however is Oliver Platt going full on ham as Porthos giving a delightfully over the top performance and walking off with the picture whenever he is on screen. Rebecca De Mornay also seems to be having a good time enacting the villainous Milady de Winter, she's sexy and silky. Lastly there is Tim Curry positively consuming the scenery as Cardinal Richelieu, in his flowing red robes he and Oliver Platt are in a dead heat for biggest scene stealer. The production is high class with vibrant with color and beautiful settings, true it bears only a passing kinship with the source book but it is a fun time with lots of action and a carefree mood.

    After seeing almost every version of The Three Musketeers i watched this version expecting to be bored to death. But how can a movie with Tim Curry and Charlie Sheen be boring ? This version was fun to watch from start to finish even though it had some bad choices ( Hugh' O'Connor, Chris O'Donnell) the storyline was OK and the acting brilliant. Athos , Porthos and Aramis were finally portrayed by good actors and Curry was a scheming bastard but funny at the same time.I still have to see a good D'Artagnan and this still wasn't it , O'Donnell came out and the least important character and his acting didn't help. All in all, a fun version and i hoped it would be the last but it looks like i was wrong. Too bad they didn't the Man in the Iron Mask with these actors, it would have been hilarious and we wouldn't have to see the DiCaprio version with some has beens Musketeers.

    The three best of the disbanded Musketeers - Athos, Porthos, and Aramis - join a young hotheaded would-be-Musketeer, D'Artagnan, to stop the Cardinal Richelieu's evil plot: to form an alliance with enemy England by way of the mysterious Milady. Rochefort, the Cardinal's right-hand man, announces the official disbanding of the King's Musketeers. Three, however, refuse to throw down their swords - Athos the fighter and drinker, Porthos the pirate and lover, and Aramis the priest and poet. Arriving in Paris to join the Musketeers, D'Artagnan uncovers the Cardinal's plans, and the four set out on a mission to protect King and Country.... From the upstart of the film, you cannot help but think Disney is trying to cash in on the 'Prince of Thieves' bandwagon. For one Wincott pays the second in command villain, and Bryan Adams provides the 'big' song. Whilst it's nowhere near as fun as the aforementioned movie,it still has it's moments and the titular characters are a hoot whenever they are together on screen. O' Donnell on the other hand is the kiss of death for this movie, and ruins every scene he's in. It just goes to show that 'scent of a woman' was a one trick pony. Luckily Sheen, Sutherland and Platt share most of his scenes and over shadow him at all times. Curry is crazily fun as the Cardinal and just keeps the ham and cheese light. Other characters are wasted, and annoying, but the last third of the film ups the action ante and makes the whole thing worth sitting through. Just.

    Now this is a true Three Musketeers movie. I grew up absolutely loving this film to virtually no end. No other version compares to it. We all know the story: The treacherous Cardinal Richelieu (Tim Currey) plots to overthrow the king of France by disbanding his guard, the musketeers, and forming an alliance with the Duke of Bukingham. With the the help of the one-eyed Captain Rochefort (Michael Wincott) and the deadly Countess DeWinter (Rebecca De Mornay), it seems that the Cardinal is unstoppable. Luckily, the three musketeers stand in his way. With the help of the young and cocky D'Artagnan (Chris O'Donnell), Athos (Kiefer Sutherland), Porthos (Oliver Platt), and Aramis (Charles Sheen) shall cut down evil and save all of France. This movie has all the charm, action, drama, and comedy mixed with an all-star cast. The villains are delightfully despicable the way they play around with the thoughts and actions of all the clueless people around them. The musketeers are truly unique: Athos having the tendency to be serious, Porthos being the comical ladies man with all kinds of crazy weapons, and Aramis as a mild mannered priest. D'Artagnan is a bit stubborn to a fault, but he's still pretty good. Definitely superior to every other movie adaptation. Check out this wonderful adventure.

    There are about 130+ reviews on this film and while I have not read every single one, I have read a handful. What I am about to say may have already been stated by someone else, but like I said, I have not read every single review. The reviews that I did happen to look through were quite critical of the film. The most popular critique was that it was not an accurate adaptation of Alexander Dumas' novel. I am hear to tell you that that's the point. This version of The Three Musketeers was never about being an accurate adaptation. While it highlights key components of the story and some history (like who the Musketeers were, etc) it was meant to focus more on (to quote Charlie Sheen on the Behind the Scenes on the DVD) "the camaraderie. the essence of brotherhood." I also noticed people complaining it's not a family film. Of course it's not. It's not just Disney it's also a Touchstone film. Yes, I know Disney (either owns or is merged with Touchstone. Something like that.) Either way, it doesn't have to be strictly the Disney we know. So if you're looking for a more accurate adaptation of the novel then this film is not for you. I would recommend one of the versions that was created before 1993. I think the one made sometime in the 40s is more accurate and I believe the one from the 70s may also be more accurate for certain people's tastes.

I am hear to tell you that that's the point. This version of The Three Musketeers was never about being an accurate adaptation. While it highlights key components of the story and some history (like who the Musketeers were, etc) it was meant to focus more on (to quote Charlie Sheen on the Behind the Scenes on the DVD) "the camaraderie. the essence of brotherhood." I also noticed people complaining it's not a family film. Of course it's not. It's not just Disney it's also a Touchstone film. Yes, I know Disney (either owns or is merged with Touchstone. Something like that.) Either way, it doesn't have to be strictly the Disney we know. So if you're looking for a more accurate adaptation of the novel then this film is not for you. I would recommend one of the versions that was created before 1993. I think the one made sometime in the 40s is more accurate and I believe the one from the 70s may also be more accurate for certain people's tastes.

    I got one word for this movie: Stupid! Just flat out, plain stupid! Overall, this was a very entertaining and it had the moments, but I have to say it was one of the worst versions of The Three Musketeers ever and I hope this latest version of The Three Musketeers is better. The plot in this movie did not follow the original plot and there was not enough dialogue between some very important characters from the book. Yes, this movie is meant for entertaining the kids and family, and I will admit there were a couple of times where I laughed at it, but that was mostly because of how stupid and inaccurate the screen writer made the movie. The whole plot is where the Cardinal, who is portrayed as an evil, merciless man, dismisses the musketeers as the king's bodyguards so the musketeers wouldn't be in the way of his evil plan to become king and in comes D'Artagnan who is just itching to be a musketeer like his father finds out about the Cardinal's plot so he and the three musketeers have to go and stop the evil plot. D'Artagnan is a naive and hot-headed little boy and perhaps a bit stupid; Athos is a brave drunk; Aramis is a humble, religious man yet a seducer(?); and Porthos is an arrogant womanizer and a pirate?!?!?! Where exactly did the pirate come from? When D'Artagnan found out Porthos was a pirate, he was actually AMAZED by it! Amazed by it? If D'Artagnan ever first found this out in the first place, he would not even step a foot near Porthos again! Did Disney even know back then that if you were found out to be a pirate or associating yourself with a pirate, you would be hanged?!?!?!?!?! Obviously not! They just think that everything they do in this movie is possible, even with a pirate being able to be a musketeer, not to mention a religious man such as Aramis being a seducer! And where exactly did the ninja come from? This takes place in the 17th century in France, so how exactly does the ninja fit in this movie? If this was a ninja or samurai version of The Three Musketeers, then maybe I would find the ninja believable, but since this is NOT a ninja or samurai version of The Three Musketeers, then I would have to say that Disney did a pretty poor job at creating this movie! The movie was entertaining, but just stupid. Do yourselves and your kids a favor, don't have them watch this horrible crap because it just gives them the wrong idea on the actual historic figures and facts.

    OK, this isn't actually the fab cartoon series Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds, but Stephen Herek's Disney film is basically a live action cartoon. Starring Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland, Chris O'Donnell and Oliver Platt as Aramis-Athos-D'Artagnan and Porthos respectively, story is a fictional load of guff involving Tim Curry's evil Cardinal Richelieu trying to usurp Hugh O'Conor's King Louis XIII of France. Enter the last remaining Musketeers, sworn to serve their King, who after being joined by D'Artagnan set about foiling dastardly plans whilst admiring heaving bosoms. There's a couple of half decent sword fighting scenes, the photography (Dean Semler) and costuming is first rate, and undeniably there's a sense of fun about the whole thing; even if some of it is not intentional. But it's a pretty flat experience as valid entertainment, almost every casting decision is wrong, with O'Donnell and Sheen ridiculous beyond belief, the plot is wafer thin, the dialogue awful and the running time is padded out with music that hinders rather than enhances the pic. Michael Wincott (Captain Rochefort) and Rebecca De Mornay's (Milady De Winter/Sabine) breasts come out of the production in credit, but really you should seek out the Muskehounds as a better alternative for cartoon swordery. 4/10

    What's good? I guess the setup, dresses and production was OK. What's bad? Well, almost everything else. The melodrama, the deep emotions, the compelling story.. it's a bit like drinking old whiskey with coke. Gives you the hickup but doesn't satisfy your thirst. Unlike somebody else, who gave this piece of crap one star, I do give it four - for the reasons mentioned above. Cardinal Richelieu is perhaps the best character in the whole story, but the biggest failure here is that Disney had to chew it all down to little pretty pieces for kids to digest. I believe children can handle a bit more, but the Three Musketeers was never meant for children anyway. I think I will next try to find the best french version of this and hope it might live up to the original story better. So far the absolutely best movie version of this story has been the late 30's one with Gene Kelly. Check out how EFFORTLESSLY he jumps 4-5 meters during the duel scene around the pond.. but then he was physically far superior to O'Donnell, who is all buff but not really fast or explosive in any way whatsoever.

    Yes, there are liberties taken with the plot lines - the worst being Cardinal Richelieu thinking he could be King. But heyho Alan Rickman as Sheriff of Nottingham in Kev's 'Robin Hood' was trying it on the same, and had less chance than the Grey Eminence. Hollywood does take terrible liberties with European classics, just like Abe Lincoln, Vampire Slayer!!! The film is cheeky in tone, with plenty of swordfighting, derring do and love betrayed, but it does not quite shirk the state terror of executing Milady! The end is dragged out rather but the acting is pretty good and the storyline lollops along nicely. It is trying to emulate Dick Lester's version but comes up short against a really fine film that gets the balance of staying true to the book and getting plenty of laughs - remember Charlton Heston as Richelieu talking to Raquel Welch's husband played by Spike Milligan!!!!!!!!!! - Priceless. Enjoyable romp if you don't mind the changes to storyline and Tim Curry's overacting.

    My wife and I sat and watched this movie the other night. Considering that it is almost twenty years old, it is an enjoyable, easy to follow adventure story. Seeing Charlie Sheen and Sutherland in so young of roles almost makes you wish that you did know some of the negative aspects of their older lives. Overall, this movie is fun. The one-liners are hilarious and even though my wife could predict them, you still laugh when you hear them. Oliver Platt does a lot scene stealing with his antics, but in the course of the humor, you forgive him. For those who want a serious adaptation of the original book, this movie is not for you. For you historians who want French history, you better cover your eyes. But for those want some good entertainment and a few laughs, this movie is for you. Grade: B+

    Lightheaded and lighthearted this is the definition of escapist entertainment and that is meant as a compliment. Something to watch when you want to relax and not have to think about the plot of the movie. Chris O'Donnell is impish if a bit callow in the lead but the real show is musketeers anyway and there is where the movie excels. Keifer is suitably brooding as Athos and Charlie Sheen, before he became a surly twitchy mess, is a charming Aramis. The standout however is Oliver Platt going full on ham as Porthos giving a delightfully over the top performance and walking off with the picture whenever he is on screen. Rebecca De Mornay also seems to be having a good time enacting the villainous Milady de Winter, she's sexy and silky. Lastly there is Tim Curry positively consuming the scenery as Cardinal Richelieu, in his flowing red robes he and Oliver Platt are in a dead heat for biggest scene stealer. The production is high class with vibrant with color and beautiful settings, true it bears only a passing kinship with the source book but it is a fun time with lots of action and a carefree mood.

    After seeing almost every version of The Three Musketeers i watched this version expecting to be bored to death. But how can a movie with Tim Curry and Charlie Sheen be boring ? This version was fun to watch from start to finish even though it had some bad choices ( Hugh' O'Connor, Chris O'Donnell) the storyline was OK and the acting brilliant. Athos , Porthos and Aramis were finally portrayed by good actors and Curry was a scheming bastard but funny at the same time.I still have to see a good D'Artagnan and this still wasn't it , O'Donnell came out and the least important character and his acting didn't help. All in all, a fun version and i hoped it would be the last but it looks like i was wrong. Too bad they didn't the Man in the Iron Mask with these actors, it would have been hilarious and we wouldn't have to see the DiCaprio version with some has beens Musketeers.

    The three best of the disbanded Musketeers - Athos, Porthos, and Aramis - join a young hotheaded would-be-Musketeer, D'Artagnan, to stop the Cardinal Richelieu's evil plot: to form an alliance with enemy England by way of the mysterious Milady. Rochefort, the Cardinal's right-hand man, announces the official disbanding of the King's Musketeers. Three, however, refuse to throw down their swords - Athos the fighter and drinker, Porthos the pirate and lover, and Aramis the priest and poet. Arriving in Paris to join the Musketeers, D'Artagnan uncovers the Cardinal's plans, and the four set out on a mission to protect King and Country.... From the upstart of the film, you cannot help but think Disney is trying to cash in on the 'Prince of Thieves' bandwagon. For one Wincott pays the second in command villain, and Bryan Adams provides the 'big' song. Whilst it's nowhere near as fun as the aforementioned movie,it still has it's moments and the titular characters are a hoot whenever they are together on screen. O' Donnell on the other hand is the kiss of death for this movie, and ruins every scene he's in. It just goes to show that 'scent of a woman' was a one trick pony. Luckily Sheen, Sutherland and Platt share most of his scenes and over shadow him at all times. Curry is crazily fun as the Cardinal and just keeps the ham and cheese light. Other characters are wasted, and annoying, but the last third of the film ups the action ante and makes the whole thing worth sitting through. Just.

    Now this is a true Three Musketeers movie. I grew up absolutely loving this film to virtually no end. No other version compares to it. We all know the story: The treacherous Cardinal Richelieu (Tim Currey) plots to overthrow the king of France by disbanding his guard, the musketeers, and forming an alliance with the Duke of Bukingham. With the the help of the one-eyed Captain Rochefort (Michael Wincott) and the deadly Countess DeWinter (Rebecca De Mornay), it seems that the Cardinal is unstoppable. Luckily, the three musketeers stand in his way. With the help of the young and cocky D'Artagnan (Chris O'Donnell), Athos (Kiefer Sutherland), Porthos (Oliver Platt), and Aramis (Charles Sheen) shall cut down evil and save all of France. This movie has all the charm, action, drama, and comedy mixed with an all-star cast. The villains are delightfully despicable the way they play around with the thoughts and actions of all the clueless people around them. The musketeers are truly unique: Athos having the tendency to be serious, Porthos being the comical ladies man with all kinds of crazy weapons, and Aramis as a mild mannered priest. D'Artagnan is a bit stubborn to a fault, but he's still pretty good. Definitely superior to every other movie adaptation. Check out this wonderful adventure.

    There are about 130+ reviews on this film and while I have not read every single one, I have read a handful. What I am about to say may have already been stated by someone else, but like I said, I have not read every single review. The reviews that I did happen to look through were quite critical of the film. The most popular critique was that it was not an accurate adaptation of Alexander Dumas' novel. I am hear to tell you that that's the point. This version of The Three Musketeers was never about being an accurate adaptation. While it highlights key components of the story and some history (like who the Musketeers were, etc) it was meant to focus more on (to quote Charlie Sheen on the Behind the Scenes on the DVD) "the camaraderie. the essence of brotherhood." I also noticed people complaining it's not a family film. Of course it's not. It's not just Disney it's also a Touchstone film. Yes, I know Disney (either owns or is merged with Touchstone. Something like that.) Either way, it doesn't have to be strictly the Disney we know. So if you're looking for a more accurate adaptation of the novel then this film is not for you. I would recommend one of the versions that was created before 1993. I think the one made sometime in the 40s is more accurate and I believe the one from the 70s may also be more accurate for certain people's tastes.

    I got one word for this movie: Stupid! Just flat out, plain stupid! Overall, this was a very entertaining and it had the moments, but I have to say it was one of the worst versions of The Three Musketeers ever and I hope this latest version of The Three Musketeers is better. The plot in this movie did not follow the original plot and there was not enough dialogue between some very important characters from the book. Yes, this movie is meant for entertaining the kids and family, and I will admit there were a couple of times where I laughed at it, but that was mostly because of how stupid and inaccurate the screen writer made the movie. The whole plot is where the Cardinal, who is portrayed as an evil, merciless man, dismisses the musketeers as the king's bodyguards so the musketeers wouldn't be in the way of his evil plan to become king and in comes D'Artagnan who is just itching to be a musketeer like his father finds out about the Cardinal's plot so he and the three musketeers have to go and stop the evil plot. D'Artagnan is a naive and hot-headed little boy and perhaps a bit stupid; Athos is a brave drunk; Aramis is a humble, religious man yet a seducer(?); and Porthos is an arrogant womanizer and a pirate?!?!?! Where exactly did the pirate come from? When D'Artagnan found out Porthos was a pirate, he was actually AMAZED by it! Amazed by it? If D'Artagnan ever first found this out in the first place, he would not even step a foot near Porthos again! Did Disney even know back then that if you were found out to be a pirate or associating yourself with a pirate, you would be hanged?!?!?!?!?! Obviously not! They just think that everything they do in this movie is possible, even with a pirate being able to be a musketeer, not to mention a religious man such as Aramis being a seducer! And where exactly did the ninja come from? This takes place in the 17th century in France, so how exactly does the ninja fit in this movie? If this was a ninja or samurai version of The Three Musketeers, then maybe I would find the ninja believable, but since this is NOT a ninja or samurai version of The Three Musketeers, then I would have to say that Disney did a pretty poor job at creating this movie! The movie was entertaining, but just stupid. Do yourselves and your kids a favor, don't have them watch this horrible crap because it just gives them the wrong idea on the actual historic figures and facts.

    OK, this isn't actually the fab cartoon series Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds, but Stephen Herek's Disney film is basically a live action cartoon. Starring Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland, Chris O'Donnell and Oliver Platt as Aramis-Athos-D'Artagnan and Porthos respectively, story is a fictional load of guff involving Tim Curry's evil Cardinal Richelieu trying to usurp Hugh O'Conor's King Louis XIII of France. Enter the last remaining Musketeers, sworn to serve their King, who after being joined by D'Artagnan set about foiling dastardly plans whilst admiring heaving bosoms. There's a couple of half decent sword fighting scenes, the photography (Dean Semler) and costuming is first rate, and undeniably there's a sense of fun about the whole thing; even if some of it is not intentional. But it's a pretty flat experience as valid entertainment, almost every casting decision is wrong, with O'Donnell and Sheen ridiculous beyond belief, the plot is wafer thin, the dialogue awful and the running time is padded out with music that hinders rather than enhances the pic. Michael Wincott (Captain Rochefort) and Rebecca De Mornay's (Milady De Winter/Sabine) breasts come out of the production in credit, but really you should seek out the Muskehounds as a better alternative for cartoon swordery. 4/10

    What's good? I guess the setup, dresses and production was OK. What's bad? Well, almost everything else. The melodrama, the deep emotions, the compelling story.. it's a bit like drinking old whiskey with coke. Gives you the hickup but doesn't satisfy your thirst. Unlike somebody else, who gave this piece of crap one star, I do give it four - for the reasons mentioned above. Cardinal Richelieu is perhaps the best character in the whole story, but the biggest failure here is that Disney had to chew it all down to little pretty pieces for kids to digest. I believe children can handle a bit more, but the Three Musketeers was never meant for children anyway. I think I will next try to find the best french version of this and hope it might live up to the original story better. So far the absolutely best movie version of this story has been the late 30's one with Gene Kelly. Check out how EFFORTLESSLY he jumps 4-5 meters during the duel scene around the pond.. but then he was physically far superior to O'Donnell, who is all buff but not really fast or explosive in any way whatsoever.

    Yes, there are liberties taken with the plot lines - the worst being Cardinal Richelieu thinking he could be King. But heyho Alan Rickman as Sheriff of Nottingham in Kev's 'Robin Hood' was trying it on the same, and had less chance than the Grey Eminence. Hollywood does take terrible liberties with European classics, just like Abe Lincoln, Vampire Slayer!!! The film is cheeky in tone, with plenty of swordfighting, derring do and love betrayed, but it does not quite shirk the state terror of executing Milady! The end is dragged out rather but the acting is pretty good and the storyline lollops along nicely. It is trying to emulate Dick Lester's version but comes up short against a really fine film that gets the balance of staying true to the book and getting plenty of laughs - remember Charlton Heston as Richelieu talking to Raquel Welch's husband played by Spike Milligan!!!!!!!!!! - Priceless. Enjoyable romp if you don't mind the changes to storyline and Tim Curry's overacting.

    My wife and I sat and watched this movie the other night. Considering that it is almost twenty years old, it is an enjoyable, easy to follow adventure story. Seeing Charlie Sheen and Sutherland in so young of roles almost makes you wish that you did know some of the negative aspects of their older lives. Overall, this movie is fun. The one-liners are hilarious and even though my wife could predict them, you still laugh when you hear them. Oliver Platt does a lot scene stealing with his antics, but in the course of the humor, you forgive him. For those who want a serious adaptation of the original book, this movie is not for you. For you historians who want French history, you better cover your eyes. But for those want some good entertainment and a few laughs, this movie is for you. Grade: B+

    Lightheaded and lighthearted this is the definition of escapist entertainment and that is meant as a compliment. Something to watch when you want to relax and not have to think about the plot of the movie. Chris O'Donnell is impish if a bit callow in the lead but the real show is musketeers anyway and there is where the movie excels. Keifer is suitably brooding as Athos and Charlie Sheen, before he became a surly twitchy mess, is a charming Aramis. The standout however is Oliver Platt going full on ham as Porthos giving a delightfully over the top performance and walking off with the picture whenever he is on screen. Rebecca De Mornay also seems to be having a good time enacting the villainous Milady de Winter, she's sexy and silky. Lastly there is Tim Curry positively consuming the scenery as Cardinal Richelieu, in his flowing red robes he and Oliver Platt are in a dead heat for biggest scene stealer. The production is high class with vibrant with color and beautiful settings, true it bears only a passing kinship with the source book but it is a fun time with lots of action and a carefree mood.

    After seeing almost every version of The Three Musketeers i watched this version expecting to be bored to death. But how can a movie with Tim Curry and Charlie Sheen be boring ? This version was fun to watch from start to finish even though it had some bad choices ( Hugh' O'Connor, Chris O'Donnell) the storyline was OK and the acting brilliant. Athos , Porthos and Aramis were finally portrayed by good actors and Curry was a scheming bastard but funny at the same time.I still have to see a good D'Artagnan and this still wasn't it , O'Donnell came out and the least important character and his acting didn't help. All in all, a fun version and i hoped it would be the last but it looks like i was wrong. Too bad they didn't the Man in the Iron Mask with these actors, it would have been hilarious and we wouldn't have to see the DiCaprio version with some has beens Musketeers.

    The three best of the disbanded Musketeers - Athos, Porthos, and Aramis - join a young hotheaded would-be-Musketeer, D'Artagnan, to stop the Cardinal Richelieu's evil plot: to form an alliance with enemy England by way of the mysterious Milady. Rochefort, the Cardinal's right-hand man, announces the official disbanding of the King's Musketeers. Three, however, refuse to throw down their swords - Athos the fighter and drinker, Porthos the pirate and lover, and Aramis the priest and poet. Arriving in Paris to join the Musketeers, D'Artagnan uncovers the Cardinal's plans, and the four set out on a mission to protect King and Country.... From the upstart of the film, you cannot help but think Disney is trying to cash in on the 'Prince of Thieves' bandwagon. For one Wincott pays the second in command villain, and Bryan Adams provides the 'big' song. Whilst it's nowhere near as fun as the aforementioned movie,it still has it's moments and the titular characters are a hoot whenever they are together on screen. O' Donnell on the other hand is the kiss of death for this movie, and ruins every scene he's in. It just goes to show that 'scent of a woman' was a one trick pony. Luckily Sheen, Sutherland and Platt share most of his scenes and over shadow him at all times. Curry is crazily fun as the Cardinal and just keeps the ham and cheese light. Other characters are wasted, and annoying, but the last third of the film ups the action ante and makes the whole thing worth sitting through. Just.

    Now this is a true Three Musketeers movie. I grew up absolutely loving this film to virtually no end. No other version compares to it. We all know the story: The treacherous Cardinal Richelieu (Tim Currey) plots to overthrow the king of France by disbanding his guard, the musketeers, and forming an alliance with the Duke of Bukingham. With the the help of the one-eyed Captain Rochefort (Michael Wincott) and the deadly Countess DeWinter (Rebecca De Mornay), it seems that the Cardinal is unstoppable. Luckily, the three musketeers stand in his way. With the help of the young and cocky D'Artagnan (Chris O'Donnell), Athos (Kiefer Sutherland), Porthos (Oliver Platt), and Aramis (Charles Sheen) shall cut down evil and save all of France. This movie has all the charm, action, drama, and comedy mixed with an all-star cast. The villains are delightfully despicable the way they play around with the thoughts and actions of all the clueless people around them. The musketeers are truly unique: Athos having the tendency to be serious, Porthos being the comical ladies man with all kinds of crazy weapons, and Aramis as a mild mannered priest. D'Artagnan is a bit stubborn to a fault, but he's still pretty good. Definitely superior to every other movie adaptation. Check out this wonderful adventure.

    There are about 130+ reviews on this film and while I have not read every single one, I have read a handful. What I am about to say may have already been stated by someone else, but like I said, I have not read every single review. The reviews that I did happen to look through were quite critical of the film. The most popular critique was that it was not an accurate adaptation of Alexander Dumas' novel. I am hear to tell you that that's the point. This version of The Three Musketeers was never about being an accurate adaptation. While it highlights key components of the story and some history (like who the Musketeers were, etc) it was meant to focus more on (to quote Charlie Sheen on the Behind the Scenes on the DVD) "the camaraderie. the essence of brotherhood." I also noticed people complaining it's not a family film. Of course it's not. It's not just Disney it's also a Touchstone film. Yes, I know Disney (either owns or is merged with Touchstone. Something like that.) Either way, it doesn't have to be strictly the Disney we know. So if you're looking for a more accurate adaptation of the novel then this film is not for you. I would recommend one of the versions that was created before 1993. I think the one made sometime in the 40s is more accurate and I believe the one from the 70s may also be more accurate for certain people's tastes.

    I got one word for this movie: Stupid! Just flat out, plain stupid! Overall, this was a very entertaining and it had the moments, but I have to say it was one of the worst versions of The Three Musketeers ever and I hope this latest version of The Three Musketeers is better. The plot in this movie did not follow the original plot and there was not enough dialogue between some very important characters from the book. Yes, this movie is meant for entertaining the kids and family, and I will admit there were a couple of times where I laughed at it, but that was mostly because of how stupid and inaccurate the screen writer made the movie. The whole plot is where the Cardinal, who is portrayed as an evil, merciless man, dismisses the musketeers as the king's bodyguards so the musketeers wouldn't be in the way of his evil plan to become king and in comes D'Artagnan who is just itching to be a musketeer like his father finds out about the Cardinal's plot so he and the three musketeers have to go and stop the evil plot. D'Artagnan is a naive and hot-headed little boy and perhaps a bit stupid; Athos is a brave drunk; Aramis is a humble, religious man yet a seducer(?); and Porthos is an arrogant womanizer and a pirate?!?!?! Where exactly did the pirate come from? When D'Artagnan found out Porthos was a pirate, he was actually AMAZED by it! Amazed by it? If D'Artagnan ever first found this out in the first place, he would not even step a foot near Porthos again! Did Disney even know back then that if you were found out to be a pirate or associating yourself with a pirate, you would be hanged?!?!?!?!?! Obviously not! They just think that everything they do in this movie is possible, even with a pirate being able to be a musketeer, not to mention a religious man such as Aramis being a seducer! And where exactly did the ninja come from? This takes place in the 17th century in France, so how exactly does the ninja fit in this movie? If this was a ninja or samurai version of The Three Musketeers, then maybe I would find the ninja believable, but since this is NOT a ninja or samurai version of The Three Musketeers, then I would have to say that Disney did a pretty poor job at creating this movie! The movie was entertaining, but just stupid. Do yourselves and your kids a favor, don't have them watch this horrible crap because it just gives them the wrong idea on the actual historic figures and facts.

    OK, this isn't actually the fab cartoon series Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds, but Stephen Herek's Disney film is basically a live action cartoon. Starring Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland, Chris O'Donnell and Oliver Platt as Aramis-Athos-D'Artagnan and Porthos respectively, story is a fictional load of guff involving Tim Curry's evil Cardinal Richelieu trying to usurp Hugh O'Conor's King Louis XIII of France. Enter the last remaining Musketeers, sworn to serve their King, who after being joined by D'Artagnan set about foiling dastardly plans whilst admiring heaving bosoms. There's a couple of half decent sword fighting scenes, the photography (Dean Semler) and costuming is first rate, and undeniably there's a sense of fun about the whole thing; even if some of it is not intentional. But it's a pretty flat experience as valid entertainment, almost every casting decision is wrong, with O'Donnell and Sheen ridiculous beyond belief, the plot is wafer thin, the dialogue awful and the running time is padded out with music that hinders rather than enhances the pic. Michael Wincott (Captain Rochefort) and Rebecca De Mornay's (Milady De Winter/Sabine) breasts come out of the production in credit, but really you should seek out the Muskehounds as a better alternative for cartoon swordery. 4/10

    What's good? I guess the setup, dresses and production was OK. What's bad? Well, almost everything else. The melodrama, the deep emotions, the compelling story.. it's a bit like drinking old whiskey with coke. Gives you the hickup but doesn't satisfy your thirst. Unlike somebody else, who gave this piece of crap one star, I do give it four - for the reasons mentioned above. Cardinal Richelieu is perhaps the best character in the whole story, but the biggest failure here is that Disney had to chew it all down to little pretty pieces for kids to digest. I believe children can handle a bit more, but the Three Musketeers was never meant for children anyway. I think I will next try to find the best french version of this and hope it might live up to the original story better. So far the absolutely best movie version of this story has been the late 30's one with Gene Kelly. Check out how EFFORTLESSLY he jumps 4-5 meters during the duel scene around the pond.. but then he was physically far superior to O'Donnell, who is all buff but not really fast or explosive in any way whatsoever.

    Yes, there are liberties taken with the plot lines - the worst being Cardinal Richelieu thinking he could be King. But heyho Alan Rickman as Sheriff of Nottingham in Kev's 'Robin Hood' was trying it on the same, and had less chance than the Grey Eminence. Hollywood does take terrible liberties with European classics, just like Abe Lincoln, Vampire Slayer!!! The film is cheeky in tone, with plenty of swordfighting, derring do and love betrayed, but it does not quite shirk the state terror of executing Milady! The end is dragged out rather but the acting is pretty good and the storyline lollops along nicely. It is trying to emulate Dick Lester's version but comes up short against a really fine film that gets the balance of staying true to the book and getting plenty of laughs - remember Charlton Heston as Richelieu talking to Raquel Welch's husband played by Spike Milligan!!!!!!!!!! - Priceless. Enjoyable romp if you don't mind the changes to storyline and Tim Curry's overacting.

    My wife and I sat and watched this movie the other night. Considering that it is almost twenty years old, it is an enjoyable, easy to follow adventure story. Seeing Charlie Sheen and Sutherland in so young of roles almost makes you wish that you did know some of the negative aspects of their older lives. Overall, this movie is fun. The one-liners are hilarious and even though my wife could predict them, you still laugh when you hear them. Oliver Platt does a lot scene stealing with his antics, but in the course of the humor, you forgive him. For those who want a serious adaptation of the original book, this movie is not for you. For you historians who want French history, you better cover your eyes. But for those want some good entertainment and a few laughs, this movie is for you. Grade: B+

    Lightheaded and lighthearted this is the definition of escapist entertainment and that is meant as a compliment. Something to watch when you want to relax and not have to think about the plot of the movie. Chris O'Donnell is impish if a bit callow in the lead but the real show is musketeers anyway and there is where the movie excels. Keifer is suitably brooding as Athos and Charlie Sheen, before he became a surly twitchy mess, is a charming Aramis. The standout however is Oliver Platt going full on ham as Porthos giving a delightfully over the top performance and walking off with the picture whenever he is on screen. Rebecca De Mornay also seems to be having a good time enacting the villainous Milady de Winter, she's sexy and silky. Lastly there is Tim Curry positively consuming the scenery as Cardinal Richelieu, in his flowing red robes he and Oliver Platt are in a dead heat for biggest scene stealer. The production is high class with vibrant with color and beautiful settings, true it bears only a passing kinship with the source book but it is a fun time with lots of action and a carefree mood.

    After seeing almost every version of The Three Musketeers i watched this version expecting to be bored to death. But how can a movie with Tim Curry and Charlie Sheen be boring ? This version was fun to watch from start to finish even though it had some bad choices ( Hugh' O'Connor, Chris O'Donnell) the storyline was OK and the acting brilliant. Athos , Porthos and Aramis were finally portrayed by good actors and Curry was a scheming bastard but funny at the same time.I still have to see a good D'Artagnan and this still wasn't it , O'Donnell came out and the least important character and his acting didn't help. All in all, a fun version and i hoped it would be the last but it looks like i was wrong. Too bad they didn't the Man in the Iron Mask with these actors, it would have been hilarious and we wouldn't have to see the DiCaprio version with some has beens Musketeers.

    The three best of the disbanded Musketeers - Athos, Porthos, and Aramis - join a young hotheaded would-be-Musketeer, D'Artagnan, to stop the Cardinal Richelieu's evil plot: to form an alliance with enemy England by way of the mysterious Milady. Rochefort, the Cardinal's right-hand man, announces the official disbanding of the King's Musketeers. Three, however, refuse to throw down their swords - Athos the fighter and drinker, Porthos the pirate and lover, and Aramis the priest and poet. Arriving in Paris to join the Musketeers, D'Artagnan uncovers the Cardinal's plans, and the four set out on a mission to protect King and Country.... From the upstart of the film, you cannot help but think Disney is trying to cash in on the 'Prince of Thieves' bandwagon. For one Wincott pays the second in command villain, and Bryan Adams provides the 'big' song. Whilst it's nowhere near as fun as the aforementioned movie,it still has it's moments and the titular characters are a hoot whenever they are together on screen. O' Donnell on the other hand is the kiss of death for this movie, and ruins every scene he's in. It just goes to show that 'scent of a woman' was a one trick pony. Luckily Sheen, Sutherland and Platt share most of his scenes and over shadow him at all times. Curry is crazily fun as the Cardinal and just keeps the ham and cheese light. Other characters are wasted, and annoying, but the last third of the film ups the action ante and makes the whole thing worth sitting through. Just.

    Now this is a true Three Musketeers movie. I grew up absolutely loving this film to virtually no end. No other version compares to it. We all know the story: The treacherous Cardinal Richelieu (Tim Currey) plots to overthrow the king of France by disbanding his guard, the musketeers, and forming an alliance with the Duke of Bukingham. With the the help of the one-eyed Captain Rochefort (Michael Wincott) and the deadly Countess DeWinter (Rebecca De Mornay), it seems that the Cardinal is unstoppable. Luckily, the three musketeers stand in his way. With the help of the young and cocky D'Artagnan (Chris O'Donnell), Athos (Kiefer Sutherland), Porthos (Oliver Platt), and Aramis (Charles Sheen) shall cut down evil and save all of France. This movie has all the charm, action, drama, and comedy mixed with an all-star cast. The villains are delightfully despicable the way they play around with the thoughts and actions of all the clueless people around them. The musketeers are truly unique: Athos having the tendency to be serious, Porthos being the comical ladies man with all kinds of crazy weapons, and Aramis as a mild mannered priest. D'Artagnan is a bit stubborn to a fault, but he's still pretty good. Definitely superior to every other movie adaptation. Check out this wonderful adventure.

With the help of the young and cocky D'Artagnan (Chris O'Donnell), Athos (Kiefer Sutherland), Porthos (Oliver Platt), and Aramis (Charles Sheen) shall cut down evil and save all of France. This movie has all the charm, action, drama, and comedy mixed with an all-star cast. The villains are delightfully despicable the way they play around with the thoughts and actions of all the clueless people around them. The musketeers are truly unique: Athos having the tendency to be serious, Porthos being the comical ladies man with all kinds of crazy weapons, and Aramis as a mild mannered priest. D'Artagnan is a bit stubborn to a fault, but he's still pretty good. Definitely superior to every other movie adaptation. Check out this wonderful adventure.

    There are about 130+ reviews on this film and while I have not read every single one, I have read a handful. What I am about to say may have already been stated by someone else, but like I said, I have not read every single review. The reviews that I did happen to look through were quite critical of the film. The most popular critique was that it was not an accurate adaptation of Alexander Dumas' novel. I am hear to tell you that that's the point. This version of The Three Musketeers was never about being an accurate adaptation. While it highlights key components of the story and some history (like who the Musketeers were, etc) it was meant to focus more on (to quote Charlie Sheen on the Behind the Scenes on the DVD) "the camaraderie. the essence of brotherhood." I also noticed people complaining it's not a family film. Of course it's not. It's not just Disney it's also a Touchstone film. Yes, I know Disney (either owns or is merged with Touchstone. Something like that.) Either way, it doesn't have to be strictly the Disney we know. So if you're looking for a more accurate adaptation of the novel then this film is not for you. I would recommend one of the versions that was created before 1993. I think the one made sometime in the 40s is more accurate and I believe the one from the 70s may also be more accurate for certain people's tastes.

    I got one word for this movie: Stupid! Just flat out, plain stupid! Overall, this was a very entertaining and it had the moments, but I have to say it was one of the worst versions of The Three Musketeers ever and I hope this latest version of The Three Musketeers is better. The plot in this movie did not follow the original plot and there was not enough dialogue between some very important characters from the book. Yes, this movie is meant for entertaining the kids and family, and I will admit there were a couple of times where I laughed at it, but that was mostly because of how stupid and inaccurate the screen writer made the movie. The whole plot is where the Cardinal, who is portrayed as an evil, merciless man, dismisses the musketeers as the king's bodyguards so the musketeers wouldn't be in the way of his evil plan to become king and in comes D'Artagnan who is just itching to be a musketeer like his father finds out about the Cardinal's plot so he and the three musketeers have to go and stop the evil plot. D'Artagnan is a naive and hot-headed little boy and perhaps a bit stupid; Athos is a brave drunk; Aramis is a humble, religious man yet a seducer(?); and Porthos is an arrogant womanizer and a pirate?!?!?! Where exactly did the pirate come from? When D'Artagnan found out Porthos was a pirate, he was actually AMAZED by it! Amazed by it? If D'Artagnan ever first found this out in the first place, he would not even step a foot near Porthos again! Did Disney even know back then that if you were found out to be a pirate or associating yourself with a pirate, you would be hanged?!?!?!?!?! Obviously not! They just think that everything they do in this movie is possible, even with a pirate being able to be a musketeer, not to mention a religious man such as Aramis being a seducer! And where exactly did the ninja come from? This takes place in the 17th century in France, so how exactly does the ninja fit in this movie? If this was a ninja or samurai version of The Three Musketeers, then maybe I would find the ninja believable, but since this is NOT a ninja or samurai version of The Three Musketeers, then I would have to say that Disney did a pretty poor job at creating this movie! The movie was entertaining, but just stupid. Do yourselves and your kids a favor, don't have them watch this horrible crap because it just gives them the wrong idea on the actual historic figures and facts.
