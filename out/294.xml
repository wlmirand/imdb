    Fletcher Reede (Jim Carrey) is a fast talking attorney, and he is an amazing perpetual liar. He is divorced from his wife Audrey (Maura Tierney).

Jerry (Cary Elwes) is Audrey's new boyfriend, and he wants to take her to Boston away from Fletcher. Jim Carrey is using all his skills both physical and verbal for this Jim Carrey vehicle. You have appreciate that he put so much energy in this performance. He's not a likable guy until he stops lying. If you can stick it out until then, he might just grow on you.

    Liar Liar **1/2 (out of 4) 86 mins/ 12 Cast: Jim Carrey, Maura Tierney, Justin Cooper, Cary Elwes, Anne Haney, Jennifer Tilly, Amanda Donohoe, Jason Bernard, Swoosie Kurtz, Mitch Ryan, Christopher Mayer, Eric Pierpoint Director: Tom Shadyac Plot: A boy of 5 wishes his father would stop lying and his wish comes true, with varying consequences. JJ's Verdict: Jim Carrey, at his rubber-faced best (or worst if you hate it, like me), manages to create a sweet and loving film that would actually be better off without him. The majority of his films are just vehicles for him with little plot, but this role wasn't written for him and actually has a good plot which Carrey unfortunately distracts you from. Liar Liar focuses on Carrey's Fletcher Redde, a fast-talking and outgoing lawyer who is ready to lie to win his case as quick as a flash. So when he lets down his 5- year-old son (Justin Cooper) yet again, making many lies in the process, the boy makes a birthday wish to prevent his dad from lying for a whole day. This wish comes true without any explanation and becomes problematic for Fletcher as he cannot lie during a case where the woman he is defending is certainly in the wrong. It is kind of ironic for Fletcher that although some aspects of his life go horribly wrong, his relationship with his son and wife improves drastically. Carrey, although he puts a huge amount of effort into the film, is just not funny when he goes into his ridiculous and over-the-top physical humour mode. Although it works when he is playing around with his son, it is just not a normal thing someone would do. He flaps his arms like crazy and pulls off almost impossible facial expressions but I'm afraid he just isn't funny. In fact the only time he is funny, is a scene where he isn't jumping around everywhere but just talking. I wish he would do more of it because he is actually a very funny guy which shows off in the worryingly hilarious credits (worrying because it is probably the best part of the film). Liar Liar is a loving and actually quite cute film, which also gives us some decently entertaining court scenes. It is just a shame its lead actor doesn't suit the role he is given.

    This is the film that shot Jim Carrey to super-star status in the late 90s. Until he starred in this film, he had been in "Dumb and Dumber", "The Mask" and "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" to name a few. None of them are quite as funny or entertaining as "Liar Liar." It's basically the story of a lawyer who lies quite often, until on his son's birthday, there is a wish made for him to not lie for one day. My, the things that occur! Carrey stars as Fletcher Reede, a defense attorney who wins his cases by having the defendants lie. His life is turned upside down however, after his son's magical wish comes true. He realizes afterward that it is family that matters most, not his work. The film sends a good message to parents about not lying to your children.

    Liar Liar is a hilarious comedy about a career-focused attorney, Fletcher Reede, who has a bad habit of lying in his personal as well as professional life. Ultimately, Fletcher's son, Max, becomes fed up with his father's lies and inconsistencies and decides to put an end to it using a birthday wish. Max wishes that for one day his father cannot tell a lie. Max's wish comes true setting forth a series of hysterical events and circumstances for Fletcher. This turn of events seems like a miracle to Max who can no longer be hurt by Fletcher's lies, but where Fletcher struggles the most is in his profession. Fletcher's strong reputation as a defense attorney is based significantly on his impressive lying skills, a theme that is portrayed throughout the entire film. (The word "liar" is even used as a pun on the word "lawyer" in the very first scene of the film.) Fletcher's professional performance is basically rendered nonexistent without the ability to lie, mislead, or withhold a truthful answer. Fletcher's struggle is most evident during the trial of an extremely important divorce case Fletcher plans on winning by having his client commit perjury on the stand. But Fletcher cannot even ask a question if he knows the answer is a lie. The film continues to focus on Fletcher's predicament as an attorney with the inability to lie. At the end of his struggle, but before the day has ended, Fletcher ultimately has a change of conscience about the way he has been living his life. He realizes that he has been living senselessly and that Max is his first and most important priority. Although the comedy is over the top at times, Jim Carrey plays the role perfectly and is as hilarious as he's ever been. I mean, how could we expect anything different? I laugh constantly every time I watch this movie and feel like it never gets old. I recommend it every chance I get!

    My mother, my late aunt, and I picked up this movie because we thought it was going to be good. The concept might have worked, but the problem was that Jim Carrey spoiled everything by his extreme facial mugging. We compared him to Jerry Lewis, whom he was trying to imitate, but even Lewis never twisted his face around so much like Carrey kept doing in this movie. After a half hour, we got sick of it and unloaded the video. It's a high-concept idea, and perhaps could have worked if some other actor had done the job. If instead of twisting his face around to an extreme when he couldn't give a false answer to a question in a courtroom, the lawyer might have used a more subtle way of showing he couldn't talk, the movie might have had some laughs. But this movie had me choose to avoid any movies with Jim Carrey in it if possible. And that was the lesson I took from "Liar Liar".

    This movie is brilliant! Simply brilliant! It is so hilarious, and so funny, words can not begin to describe it. Even though I know it to be impossible I will give it a shot. The story is simply magnificent! It is like a story from a children's storybook, a book of old fairy tales. It's so amazingly brilliant and clever, I am actually out of words. No kidding! The story is so touching. It's the story of the love between father and son, mixed with jealousy, scumbags, Jim Carrey and the truth. It is a masterpiece of a movie! I have seen it several times before and still I did not mind watching it again. Actually, it was as if I had never seen it before. The acting in this movie is no less than the one of a master. Jim Carrey is a true legend. He is one of the funniest persons in the history of funny persons. He is one of the best comedians this world has ever seen. His humor is like no other. His acting indescribably unique and utter genius. He is beyond comparison! His brilliancy is also previewed in other movies, such as, "Ace Ventura: The Pet Detective", "Bruce Almighty", "A series of unfortunate events", "Yes man". And around the Christmas holidays, we think of "A Christmas Carol" and "The Grinch" of course. Timeless classics! Last time I checked Mr. Carrey was the 69th highest ranked actor in the world according to www.IMDb.com. I am not surprised by this, but I am surprised he is not ranked higher. He is nothing short of a genius! He is one of my favorite actors. Along with Jackie Chan, Mark Vincent (AKA Vin Diesel), Will Smith, Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Owen Wilson, Leo DiCaprio, Johnny Depp (definitely) and many more. Anywho, my point is this. "Liar, Liar" is a great movie and I couldn't find a single negative thing to say about it, therefore, I give it 10/10 stars. 100%. Yup, that is correct. That is my opinion and I am sticking to it. Bon Soir. Guten Nacth. Buenos Noches. Goodnight. God natt. - Shevy

    This movie is very much and example of a Jim Carrey film where Carrey runs rough shod over the script and puts on a one man comedy show. The results of this is very funny. The thing is it is one of many films that establishes Carey as a sort of Jerry Lewis for this generation. His manic comedy is very much like Lewis was in his prime. Carrey has a lot of energy here as a Lawyer who has to tell the truth for 24 hours due to his sons wish. There is some Lewis type schmaltz in his sympathy for the kiddies. In a way Carrey came along at the right time because his manic humor can include adult themes more in the 1990's where Jerry Lewis was more limited by censors what he could do. This gives Carrey's Comedy more bite than Lewis could have in his movies. For example he can tell a woman she has big... where Lewis would just be able to mug a va va voom in his movies. Carrey is very funny when he does his stuff. That is the main reason to

    Ever since societies existed, lies could either be the drivers or killers of human relationships, but I guess we have to blame it on truth. The trick with the truth is that sometimes we want to tell it but not to hear it, or vice versa. Do we really want to know what is said about us at the third person? Truth is a social double-edged sword, and lying a psychic boomerang, hitting you in the face when you don't expect it. This is why the main premise of a film like "Liar, Liar" where a man endures the curse of not lying, worse: not being able to articulate one lousy syllabic that wouldn't tell the truth is not only hilarious, but intellectually challenging, as it incites us to question the place 'lying', occupies in our lives and daily agendas... and occasionally on America's judiciary system. Indeed, maybe the fact that the story focuses on a slick lawyer in Los Angeles, a sort of Lionel Hutz in flesh and blood and competence, asks a bit too much on the suspension of disbelief department, still what a premise, the kind that probably started with a simple "what if" question and one wondered how no one ever got this idea before. It seems so clever, yet so simple, but it's not a laugh-riot guarantee either, my guess is that it's the kind of plot premises that can only work if you have the comical performance to efficiently conduct it from paper to screens. Think about that, "a man can't lie", so what, what is funny? The fact that he can't lie can easily become redundant; it's all in the diversity of reactions then. And who's better than Jim Carrey to takes you by surprises even when you expect to laugh? Only Carrey could have been so hilariously, pathetically, frantically funny in his desperate attempts to let one single lie comes out of his mouth, especially the day of a very tough divorce and child custody trial. Jim Carrey delivers his funniest performance, and certainly one of the funniest of the 90's, Adam Sandler? Chris Farley? "Liar, Liar" is the ultimate proof that Carrey is the real thing when it comes to comedy. Carrey's face is a gift from Cinematic Gods, hell, you don't even need CGI, it's like every parcel of his face is capable of displaying more hilarious elasticity than all the comics of his generation combined in all of their films. "Liar, Liar" is 80 minutes of demonstration, of Carrey's talent and comical superiority. Naturally, it's not just all about grimaces, funny faces or scream, like the best comedies, "Liar, Liar" has a heart and maintains an overwhelming everyday feeling, we're enjoying Carrey's talent, but still, we think of our own lives or lies. Marking the return of Jim Carrey after the film 'that almost ruined his career' according to Homer Simpson, "Liar, Liar" is the second collaboration with Tom Shadyak after "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" in 1994, the breakthrough year where he starred in 3 movies from the Box- office Top 10. He made it again with "Liar, Liar", for all the zaniness, Jim Carrey played a more mature, and identifiable character through Fletcher Reed, half liar, half lawyer (a clever opening joke probably lost in translation in all the foreign versions). While it does flirt a little bit with the too-busy-to-see-his-son father clich&eacute;, it avoids it by focusing on lying, this is Fletcher's problem, he can't see his child because he just built his whole life, professional, social and familial, on lying. And when the kid gets one lie too much, he blows the candle of his birthday cake and makes the wish that his father can't lie during 24 hours, the curse applies immediately with the hilarious sex aftermath comment followed by the unforgettable drool-inducing elevator scene. Indeed, this scene speaks for all the men who tried to maintain eye-control in front of a nice pair of juicy  well, that's our mind whispering to us, and Fletcher's nightmare is that it's his mind controlling his words. And while transposing his case to my personal life, I wondered to what extent my life would have been different if I had one day without lying. I even shudder thinking to the eventuality of my wife asking me some questions about my past. Of course, it's just a film, but still. So, as soon as the curse operates, the movie takes off for a magnificent, flamboyant bravura performance from Jim Carrey, one gag after another, making the little archetypes, from the cute Justin Cooper with the worst haircut ever to Maura Tierney, the comprehensive divorced wife who still has feelings toward her ex-husband and the dull and boring replacer, Cary Elwes doing well in a rather ungrateful role, not to mention the scene-stealing Jennifer Tilly as the slutty ambitious unfaithful wife, they all become insignificant, because it's Carrey's film. And Carrey carries it with the power of his face, and a terrific script, one that visits every kind of situation where the 'to lie or not to lie' dilemma plays a pivotal role, even one that allows Fletcher to relieve himself by roasting everyone during an unforgettable board meeting, literally the film's laugh-out-loudest moment. And we catch our breath during some genuine moments of true father- and-son tenderness showcasing an unknown capability for seriousness, something the previous movies didn't show. And "Liar, Liar" probably played a vital and pivotal role in Carrey's career, proving he was at ease with slapstick humor (damn, I can't get the face he had with the luggage thing stuck in his face) and emotions too, a versatility that would be confirmed in "The Truman Show" one year later. And "Liar, Liar" concludes with a nice moral, if you build your life on lies, it might collapse sooner or later, if did for Fletcher, but the essential remained, and he would finally value it.

    Jim Carrey does have a gift for slapstick comedy, making you laugh all the way to the bank, this is the second of the three movies that Tom Shadyac and Jim Carrey made together and to me it is also my second favorite after Bruce Almighty but before Ace Ventura. The thing for me is that Liar Lair, didn't strike as a very funny movie, after a while the slapstick humor become more annoying than it was entertaining. The storyline which has a sticking resemblance to a Twilight series episode which will be easy to catch by twilight fans, had the tale of not being able to lie for just 24 hours, while the Twilight series episode was about the protagonist not being able to lie as long as he owned a car or something. The movie plot is about a chronic liar and divorc&eacute;e who has wrecked his home with his insensitivity, and his carelessness. With only one thing that is true in his life Fletcher (Jim Carrey) was still finding it hard to meet up to expectations as his constant lying was costing him his relationship with his son Max (Justin Cooper). After Fletcher blew off his son's birthday party to have sex with his co-worker (lying that he had to work) Max decided to make a wish that his father will not be able to lie for a whole 24 hours. Now Fletcher is a lawyer, who has a multi-million dollar case that he is on at the moment, a case all built on lies and he is finding it difficult to keep at it, since he can't lie nor ask a question knowing full well that the answer is a lie. Well Liar Liar found a way to make a man who is insensitive and not caring find a way to have a happy ending, and all he did to learn his lesson was winning a case with some honest deductions, and chasing his son on a hijacked mobile stairway in an airport which landed him on a stretcher. Like all other Tom and Carrey movies it was a box office hit, recouping its production cost and more. This is not my favorite Carrey movie and as I have said not my favorite of his duo with Tom Shadyac but Liar Liar has its moments. So if you are jumping on the wagon of a Carrey DVD collection; you may want to consider this one, but mind you to me it is just there. www.lagsreviews.com

But this movie had me choose to avoid any movies with Jim Carrey in it if possible. And that was the lesson I took from "Liar Liar".

    This movie is brilliant! Simply brilliant! It is so hilarious, and so funny, words can not begin to describe it. Even though I know it to be impossible I will give it a shot. The story is simply magnificent! It is like a story from a children's storybook, a book of old fairy tales. It's so amazingly brilliant and clever, I am actually out of words. No kidding! The story is so touching. It's the story of the love between father and son, mixed with jealousy, scumbags, Jim Carrey and the truth. It is a masterpiece of a movie! I have seen it several times before and still I did not mind watching it again. Actually, it was as if I had never seen it before. The acting in this movie is no less than the one of a master. Jim Carrey is a true legend. He is one of the funniest persons in the history of funny persons. He is one of the best comedians this world has ever seen. His humor is like no other. His acting indescribably unique and utter genius. He is beyond comparison! His brilliancy is also previewed in other movies, such as, "Ace Ventura: The Pet Detective", "Bruce Almighty", "A series of unfortunate events", "Yes man". And around the Christmas holidays, we think of "A Christmas Carol" and "The Grinch" of course. Timeless classics! Last time I checked Mr. Carrey was the 69th highest ranked actor in the world according to www.IMDb.com. I am not surprised by this, but I am surprised he is not ranked higher. He is nothing short of a genius! He is one of my favorite actors. Along with Jackie Chan, Mark Vincent (AKA Vin Diesel), Will Smith, Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Owen Wilson, Leo DiCaprio, Johnny Depp (definitely) and many more. Anywho, my point is this. "Liar, Liar" is a great movie and I couldn't find a single negative thing to say about it, therefore, I give it 10/10 stars. 100%. Yup, that is correct. That is my opinion and I am sticking to it.

    This movie is very much and example of a Jim Carrey film where Carrey runs rough shod over the script and puts on a one man comedy show. The results of this is very funny. The thing is it is one of many films that establishes Carey as a sort of Jerry Lewis for this generation. His manic comedy is very much like Lewis was in his prime. Carrey has a lot of energy here as a Lawyer who has to tell the truth for 24 hours due to his sons wish. There is some Lewis type schmaltz in his sympathy for the kiddies. In a way Carrey came along at the right time because his manic humor can include adult themes more in the 1990's where Jerry Lewis was more limited by censors what he could do. This gives Carrey's Comedy more bite than Lewis could have in his movies. For example he can tell a woman she has big... where Lewis would just be able to mug a va va voom in his movies. Carrey is very funny when he does his stuff. That is the main reason to

    Ever since societies existed, lies could either be the drivers or killers of human relationships, but I guess we have to blame it on truth. The trick with the truth is that sometimes we want to tell it but not to hear it, or vice versa. Do we really want to know what is said about us at the third person? Truth is a social double-edged sword, and lying a psychic boomerang, hitting you in the face when you don't expect it. This is why the main premise of a film like "Liar, Liar" where a man endures the curse of not lying, worse: not being able to articulate one lousy syllabic that wouldn't tell the truth is not only hilarious, but intellectually challenging, as it incites us to question the place 'lying', occupies in our lives and daily agendas... and occasionally on America's judiciary system. Indeed, maybe the fact that the story focuses on a slick lawyer in Los Angeles, a sort of Lionel Hutz in flesh and blood and competence, asks a bit too much on the suspension of disbelief department, still what a premise, the kind that probably started with a simple "what if" question and one wondered how no one ever got this idea before. It seems so clever, yet so simple, but it's not a laugh-riot guarantee either, my guess is that it's the kind of plot premises that can only work if you have the comical performance to efficiently conduct it from paper to screens. Think about that, "a man can't lie", so what, what is funny? The fact that he can't lie can easily become redundant; it's all in the diversity of reactions then. And who's better than Jim Carrey to takes you by surprises even when you expect to laugh? Only Carrey could have been so hilariously, pathetically, frantically funny in his desperate attempts to let one single lie comes out of his mouth, especially the day of a very tough divorce and child custody trial. Jim Carrey delivers his funniest performance, and certainly one of the funniest of the 90's, Adam Sandler? Chris Farley? "Liar, Liar" is the ultimate proof that Carrey is the real thing when it comes to comedy. Carrey's face is a gift from Cinematic Gods, hell, you don't even need CGI, it's like every parcel of his face is capable of displaying more hilarious elasticity than all the comics of his generation combined in all of their films. "Liar, Liar" is 80 minutes of demonstration, of Carrey's talent and comical superiority. Naturally, it's not just all about grimaces, funny faces or scream, like the best comedies, "Liar, Liar" has a heart and maintains an overwhelming everyday feeling, we're enjoying Carrey's talent, but still, we think of our own lives or lies. Marking the return of Jim Carrey after the film 'that almost ruined his career' according to Homer Simpson, "Liar, Liar" is the second collaboration with Tom Shadyak after "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" in 1994, the breakthrough year where he starred in 3 movies from the Box- office Top 10. He made it again with "Liar, Liar", for all the zaniness, Jim Carrey played a more mature, and identifiable character through Fletcher Reed, half liar, half lawyer (a clever opening joke probably lost in translation in all the foreign versions). While it does flirt a little bit with the too-busy-to-see-his-son father clich&eacute;, it avoids it by focusing on lying, this is Fletcher's problem, he can't see his child because he just built his whole life, professional, social and familial, on lying. And when the kid gets one lie too much, he blows the candle of his birthday cake and makes the wish that his father can't lie during 24 hours, the curse applies immediately with the hilarious sex aftermath comment followed by the unforgettable drool-inducing elevator scene. Indeed, this scene speaks for all the men who tried to maintain eye-control in front of a nice pair of juicy  well, that's our mind whispering to us, and Fletcher's nightmare is that it's his mind controlling his words. And while transposing his case to my personal life, I wondered to what extent my life would have been different if I had one day without lying. I even shudder thinking to the eventuality of my wife asking me some questions about my past. Of course, it's just a film, but still. So, as soon as the curse operates, the movie takes off for a magnificent, flamboyant bravura performance from Jim Carrey, one gag after another, making the little archetypes, from the cute Justin Cooper with the worst haircut ever to Maura Tierney, the comprehensive divorced wife who still has feelings toward her ex-husband and the dull and boring replacer, Cary Elwes doing well in a rather ungrateful role, not to mention the scene-stealing Jennifer Tilly as the slutty ambitious unfaithful wife, they all become insignificant, because it's Carrey's film. And Carrey carries it with the power of his face, and a terrific script, one that visits every kind of situation where the 'to lie or not to lie' dilemma plays a pivotal role, even one that allows Fletcher to relieve himself by roasting everyone during an unforgettable board meeting, literally the film's laugh-out-loudest moment. And we catch our breath during some genuine moments of true father- and-son tenderness showcasing an unknown capability for seriousness, something the previous movies didn't show. And "Liar, Liar" probably played a vital and pivotal role in Carrey's career, proving he was at ease with slapstick humor (damn, I can't get the face he had with the luggage thing stuck in his face) and emotions too, a versatility that would be confirmed in "The Truman Show" one year later. And "Liar, Liar" concludes with a nice moral, if you build your life on lies, it might collapse sooner or later, if did for Fletcher, but the essential remained, and he would finally value it.

    Jim Carrey does have a gift for slapstick comedy, making you laugh all the way to the bank, this is the second of the three movies that Tom Shadyac and Jim Carrey made together and to me it is also my second favorite after Bruce Almighty but before Ace Ventura. The thing for me is that Liar Lair, didn't strike as a very funny movie, after a while the slapstick humor become more annoying than it was entertaining. The storyline which has a sticking resemblance to a Twilight series episode which will be easy to catch by twilight fans, had the tale of not being able to lie for just 24 hours, while the Twilight series episode was about the protagonist not being able to lie as long as he owned a car or something. The movie plot is about a chronic liar and divorc&eacute;e who has wrecked his home with his insensitivity, and his carelessness. With only one thing that is true in his life Fletcher (Jim Carrey) was still finding it hard to meet up to expectations as his constant lying was costing him his relationship with his son Max (Justin Cooper). After Fletcher blew off his son's birthday party to have sex with his co-worker (lying that he had to work) Max decided to make a wish that his father will not be able to lie for a whole 24 hours. Now Fletcher is a lawyer, who has a multi-million dollar case that he is on at the moment, a case all built on lies and he is finding it difficult to keep at it, since he can't lie nor ask a question knowing full well that the answer is a lie. Well Liar Liar found a way to make a man who is insensitive and not caring find a way to have a happy ending, and all he did to learn his lesson was winning a case with some honest deductions, and chasing his son on a hijacked mobile stairway in an airport which landed him on a stretcher. Like all other Tom and Carrey movies it was a box office hit, recouping its production cost and more. This is not my favorite Carrey movie and as I have said not my favorite of his duo with Tom Shadyac but Liar Liar has its moments. So if you are jumping on the wagon of a Carrey DVD collection; you may want to consider this one, but mind you to me it is just there. www.lagsreviews.com

    Fletcher Reede (Jim Carrey) is a fast talking attorney, and he is an amazing perpetual liar. He is divorced from his wife Audrey (Maura Tierney). When he breaks his promise to his son to be at his birthday party, his son uses his birthday wish to make his father stop lying for one full day. Jerry (Cary Elwes) is Audrey's new boyfriend, and he wants to take her to Boston away from Fletcher. Jim Carrey is using all his skills both physical and verbal for this Jim Carrey vehicle. You have appreciate that he put so much energy in this performance. He's not a likable guy until he stops lying. If you can stick it out until then, he might just grow on you.

    Liar Liar **1/2 (out of 4) 86 mins/ 12 Cast: Jim Carrey, Maura Tierney, Justin Cooper, Cary Elwes, Anne Haney, Jennifer Tilly, Amanda Donohoe, Jason Bernard, Swoosie Kurtz, Mitch Ryan, Christopher Mayer, Eric Pierpoint Director: Tom Shadyac Plot: A boy of 5 wishes his father would stop lying and his wish comes true, with varying consequences. JJ's Verdict: Jim Carrey, at his rubber-faced best (or worst if you hate it, like me), manages to create a sweet and loving film that would actually be better off without him. The majority of his films are just vehicles for him with little plot, but this role wasn't written for him and actually has a good plot which Carrey unfortunately distracts you from. Liar Liar focuses on Carrey's Fletcher Redde, a fast-talking and outgoing lawyer who is ready to lie to win his case as quick as a flash. So when he lets down his 5- year-old son (Justin Cooper) yet again, making many lies in the process, the boy makes a birthday wish to prevent his dad from lying for a whole day. This wish comes true without any explanation and becomes problematic for Fletcher as he cannot lie during a case where the woman he is defending is certainly in the wrong. It is kind of ironic for Fletcher that although some aspects of his life go horribly wrong, his relationship with his son and wife improves drastically. Carrey, although he puts a huge amount of effort into the film, is just not funny when he goes into his ridiculous and over-the-top physical humour mode. Although it works when he is playing around with his son, it is just not a normal thing someone would do. He flaps his arms like crazy and pulls off almost impossible facial expressions but I'm afraid he just isn't funny. In fact the only time he is funny, is a scene where he isn't jumping around everywhere but just talking. I wish he would do more of it because he is actually a very funny guy which shows off in the worryingly hilarious credits (worrying because it is probably the best part of the film). Liar Liar is a loving and actually quite cute film, which also gives us some decently entertaining court scenes. It is just a shame its lead actor doesn't suit the role he is given.

    This is the film that shot Jim Carrey to super-star status in the late 90s. Until he starred in this film, he had been in "Dumb and Dumber", "The Mask" and "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" to name a few. None of them are quite as funny or entertaining as "Liar Liar." It's basically the story of a lawyer who lies quite often, until on his son's birthday, there is a wish made for him to not lie for one day. My, the things that occur! Carrey stars as Fletcher Reede, a defense attorney who wins his cases by having the defendants lie. His life is turned upside down however, after his son's magical wish comes true. He realizes afterward that it is family that matters most, not his work. The film sends a good message to parents about not lying to your children.

    Liar Liar is a hilarious comedy about a career-focused attorney, Fletcher Reede, who has a bad habit of lying in his personal as well as professional life. Ultimately, Fletcher's son, Max, becomes fed up with his father's lies and inconsistencies and decides to put an end to it using a birthday wish. Max wishes that for one day his father cannot tell a lie. Max's wish comes true setting forth a series of hysterical events and circumstances for Fletcher. This turn of events seems like a miracle to Max who can no longer be hurt by Fletcher's lies, but where Fletcher struggles the most is in his profession. Fletcher's strong reputation as a defense attorney is based significantly on his impressive lying skills, a theme that is portrayed throughout the entire film. (The word "liar" is even used as a pun on the word "lawyer" in the very first scene of the film.) Fletcher's professional performance is basically rendered nonexistent without the ability to lie, mislead, or withhold a truthful answer. Fletcher's struggle is most evident during the trial of an extremely important divorce case Fletcher plans on winning by having his client commit perjury on the stand. But Fletcher cannot even ask a question if he knows the answer is a lie. The film continues to focus on Fletcher's predicament as an attorney with the inability to lie. At the end of his struggle, but before the day has ended, Fletcher ultimately has a change of conscience about the way he has been living his life. He realizes that he has been living senselessly and that Max is his first and most important priority. Although the comedy is over the top at times, Jim Carrey plays the role perfectly and is as hilarious as he's ever been. I mean, how could we expect anything different? I laugh constantly every time I watch this movie and feel like it never gets old. I recommend it every chance I get!

    My mother, my late aunt, and I picked up this movie because we thought it was going to be good. The concept might have worked, but the problem was that Jim Carrey spoiled everything by his extreme facial mugging. We compared him to Jerry Lewis, whom he was trying to imitate, but even Lewis never twisted his face around so much like Carrey kept doing in this movie. After a half hour, we got sick of it and unloaded the video. It's a high-concept idea, and perhaps could have worked if some other actor had done the job. If instead of twisting his face around to an extreme when he couldn't give a false answer to a question in a courtroom, the lawyer might have used a more subtle way of showing he couldn't talk, the movie might have had some laughs.

With only one thing that is true in his life Fletcher (Jim Carrey) was still finding it hard to meet up to expectations as his constant lying was costing him his relationship with his son Max (Justin Cooper). After Fletcher blew off his son's birthday party to have sex with his co-worker (lying that he had to work) Max decided to make a wish that his father will not be able to lie for a whole 24 hours. Now Fletcher is a lawyer, who has a multi-million dollar case that he is on at the moment, a case all built on lies and he is finding it difficult to keep at it, since he can't lie nor ask a question knowing full well that the answer is a lie. Well Liar Liar found a way to make a man who is insensitive and not caring find a way to have a happy ending, and all he did to learn his lesson was winning a case with some honest deductions, and chasing his son on a hijacked mobile stairway in an airport which landed him on a stretcher. Like all other Tom and Carrey movies it was a box office hit, recouping its production cost and more. This is not my favorite Carrey movie and as I have said not my favorite of his duo with Tom Shadyac but Liar Liar has its moments. So if you are jumping on the wagon of a Carrey DVD collection; you may want to consider this one, but mind you to me it is just there. www.lagsreviews.com

    Fletcher Reede (Jim Carrey) is a fast talking attorney, and he is an amazing perpetual liar. He is divorced from his wife Audrey (Maura Tierney). When he breaks his promise to his son to be at his birthday party, his son uses his birthday wish to make his father stop lying for one full day. Jerry (Cary Elwes) is Audrey's new boyfriend, and he wants to take her to Boston away from Fletcher. Jim Carrey is using all his skills both physical and verbal for this Jim Carrey vehicle. You have appreciate that he put so much energy in this performance. He's not a likable guy until he stops lying. If you can stick it out until then, he might just grow on you.

    Liar Liar **1/2 (out of 4) 86 mins/ 12 Cast: Jim Carrey, Maura Tierney, Justin Cooper, Cary Elwes, Anne Haney, Jennifer Tilly, Amanda Donohoe, Jason Bernard, Swoosie Kurtz, Mitch Ryan, Christopher Mayer, Eric Pierpoint Director: Tom Shadyac Plot: A boy of 5 wishes his father would stop lying and his wish comes true, with varying consequences. JJ's Verdict: Jim Carrey, at his rubber-faced best (or worst if you hate it, like me), manages to create a sweet and loving film that would actually be better off without him. The majority of his films are just vehicles for him with little plot, but this role wasn't written for him and actually has a good plot which Carrey unfortunately distracts you from. Liar Liar focuses on Carrey's Fletcher Redde, a fast-talking and outgoing lawyer who is ready to lie to win his case as quick as a flash. So when he lets down his 5- year-old son (Justin Cooper) yet again, making many lies in the process, the boy makes a birthday wish to prevent his dad from lying for a whole day. This wish comes true without any explanation and becomes problematic for Fletcher as he cannot lie during a case where the woman he is defending is certainly in the wrong. It is kind of ironic for Fletcher that although some aspects of his life go horribly wrong, his relationship with his son and wife improves drastically. Carrey, although he puts a huge amount of effort into the film, is just not funny when he goes into his ridiculous and over-the-top physical humour mode. Although it works when he is playing around with his son, it is just not a normal thing someone would do. He flaps his arms like crazy and pulls off almost impossible facial expressions but I'm afraid he just isn't funny. In fact the only time he is funny, is a scene where he isn't jumping around everywhere but just talking. I wish he would do more of it because he is actually a very funny guy which shows off in the worryingly hilarious credits (worrying because it is probably the best part of the film). Liar Liar is a loving and actually quite cute film, which also gives us some decently entertaining court scenes. It is just a shame its lead actor doesn't suit the role he is given.

    This is the film that shot Jim Carrey to super-star status in the late 90s. Until he starred in this film, he had been in "Dumb and Dumber", "The Mask" and "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" to name a few. None of them are quite as funny or entertaining as "Liar Liar." It's basically the story of a lawyer who lies quite often, until on his son's birthday, there is a wish made for him to not lie for one day. My, the things that occur! Carrey stars as Fletcher Reede, a defense attorney who wins his cases by having the defendants lie. His life is turned upside down however, after his son's magical wish comes true. He realizes afterward that it is family that matters most, not his work. The film sends a good message to parents about not lying to your children.

    Liar Liar is a hilarious comedy about a career-focused attorney, Fletcher Reede, who has a bad habit of lying in his personal as well as professional life. Ultimately, Fletcher's son, Max, becomes fed up with his father's lies and inconsistencies and decides to put an end to it using a birthday wish. Max wishes that for one day his father cannot tell a lie. Max's wish comes true setting forth a series of hysterical events and circumstances for Fletcher. This turn of events seems like a miracle to Max who can no longer be hurt by Fletcher's lies, but where Fletcher struggles the most is in his profession. Fletcher's strong reputation as a defense attorney is based significantly on his impressive lying skills, a theme that is portrayed throughout the entire film. (The word "liar" is even used as a pun on the word "lawyer" in the very first scene of the film.) Fletcher's professional performance is basically rendered nonexistent without the ability to lie, mislead, or withhold a truthful answer. Fletcher's struggle is most evident during the trial of an extremely important divorce case Fletcher plans on winning by having his client commit perjury on the stand. But Fletcher cannot even ask a question if he knows the answer is a lie. The film continues to focus on Fletcher's predicament as an attorney with the inability to lie. At the end of his struggle, but before the day has ended, Fletcher ultimately has a change of conscience about the way he has been living his life. He realizes that he has been living senselessly and that Max is his first and most important priority. Although the comedy is over the top at times, Jim Carrey plays the role perfectly and is as hilarious as he's ever been. I mean, how could we expect anything different? I laugh constantly every time I watch this movie and feel like it never gets old. I recommend it every chance I get!

    My mother, my late aunt, and I picked up this movie because we thought it was going to be good. The concept might have worked, but the problem was that Jim Carrey spoiled everything by his extreme facial mugging. We compared him to Jerry Lewis, whom he was trying to imitate, but even Lewis never twisted his face around so much like Carrey kept doing in this movie. After a half hour, we got sick of it and unloaded the video. It's a high-concept idea, and perhaps could have worked if some other actor had done the job. If instead of twisting his face around to an extreme when he couldn't give a false answer to a question in a courtroom, the lawyer might have used a more subtle way of showing he couldn't talk, the movie might have had some laughs. But this movie had me choose to avoid any movies with Jim Carrey in it if possible. And that was the lesson I took from "Liar Liar".

    This movie is brilliant! Simply brilliant! It is so hilarious, and so funny, words can not begin to describe it. Even though I know it to be impossible I will give it a shot. The story is simply magnificent! It is like a story from a children's storybook, a book of old fairy tales. It's so amazingly brilliant and clever, I am actually out of words. No kidding! The story is so touching. It's the story of the love between father and son, mixed with jealousy, scumbags, Jim Carrey and the truth. It is a masterpiece of a movie! I have seen it several times before and still I did not mind watching it again. Actually, it was as if I had never seen it before. The acting in this movie is no less than the one of a master. Jim Carrey is a true legend. He is one of the funniest persons in the history of funny persons. He is one of the best comedians this world has ever seen. His humor is like no other. His acting indescribably unique and utter genius. He is beyond comparison! His brilliancy is also previewed in other movies, such as, "Ace Ventura: The Pet Detective", "Bruce Almighty", "A series of unfortunate events", "Yes man". And around the Christmas holidays, we think of "A Christmas Carol" and "The Grinch" of course. Timeless classics! Last time I checked Mr. Carrey was the 69th highest ranked actor in the world according to www.IMDb.com. I am not surprised by this, but I am surprised he is not ranked higher. He is nothing short of a genius! He is one of my favorite actors. Along with Jackie Chan, Mark Vincent (AKA Vin Diesel), Will Smith, Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Owen Wilson, Leo DiCaprio, Johnny Depp (definitely) and many more. Anywho, my point is this. "Liar, Liar" is a great movie and I couldn't find a single negative thing to say about it, therefore, I give it 10/10 stars. 100%. Yup, that is correct. That is my opinion and I am sticking to it. Bon Soir. Guten Nacth. Buenos Noches. Goodnight. God natt. - Shevy

    This movie is very much and example of a Jim Carrey film where Carrey runs rough shod over the script and puts on a one man comedy show. The results of this is very funny. The thing is it is one of many films that establishes Carey as a sort of Jerry Lewis for this generation. His manic comedy is very much like Lewis was in his prime. Carrey has a lot of energy here as a Lawyer who has to tell the truth for 24 hours due to his sons wish. There is some Lewis type schmaltz in his sympathy for the kiddies. In a way Carrey came along at the right time because his manic humor can include adult themes more in the 1990's where Jerry Lewis was more limited by censors what he could do. This gives Carrey's Comedy more bite than Lewis could have in his movies. For example he can tell a woman she has big... where Lewis would just be able to mug a va va voom in his movies. Carrey is very funny when he does his stuff. That is the main reason to

    Ever since societies existed, lies could either be the drivers or killers of human relationships, but I guess we have to blame it on truth. The trick with the truth is that sometimes we want to tell it but not to hear it, or vice versa. Do we really want to know what is said about us at the third person? Truth is a social double-edged sword, and lying a psychic boomerang, hitting you in the face when you don't expect it. This is why the main premise of a film like "Liar, Liar" where a man endures the curse of not lying, worse: not being able to articulate one lousy syllabic that wouldn't tell the truth is not only hilarious, but intellectually challenging, as it incites us to question the place 'lying', occupies in our lives and daily agendas... and occasionally on America's judiciary system. Indeed, maybe the fact that the story focuses on a slick lawyer in Los Angeles, a sort of Lionel Hutz in flesh and blood and competence, asks a bit too much on the suspension of disbelief department, still what a premise, the kind that probably started with a simple "what if" question and one wondered how no one ever got this idea before. It seems so clever, yet so simple, but it's not a laugh-riot guarantee either, my guess is that it's the kind of plot premises that can only work if you have the comical performance to efficiently conduct it from paper to screens. Think about that, "a man can't lie", so what, what is funny? The fact that he can't lie can easily become redundant; it's all in the diversity of reactions then. And who's better than Jim Carrey to takes you by surprises even when you expect to laugh? Only Carrey could have been so hilariously, pathetically, frantically funny in his desperate attempts to let one single lie comes out of his mouth, especially the day of a very tough divorce and child custody trial. Jim Carrey delivers his funniest performance, and certainly one of the funniest of the 90's, Adam Sandler? Chris Farley? "Liar, Liar" is the ultimate proof that Carrey is the real thing when it comes to comedy. Carrey's face is a gift from Cinematic Gods, hell, you don't even need CGI, it's like every parcel of his face is capable of displaying more hilarious elasticity than all the comics of his generation combined in all of their films. "Liar, Liar" is 80 minutes of demonstration, of Carrey's talent and comical superiority. Naturally, it's not just all about grimaces, funny faces or scream, like the best comedies, "Liar, Liar" has a heart and maintains an overwhelming everyday feeling, we're enjoying Carrey's talent, but still, we think of our own lives or lies. Marking the return of Jim Carrey after the film 'that almost ruined his career' according to Homer Simpson, "Liar, Liar" is the second collaboration with Tom Shadyak after "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" in 1994, the breakthrough year where he starred in 3 movies from the Box- office Top 10. He made it again with "Liar, Liar", for all the zaniness, Jim Carrey played a more mature, and identifiable character through Fletcher Reed, half liar, half lawyer (a clever opening joke probably lost in translation in all the foreign versions). While it does flirt a little bit with the too-busy-to-see-his-son father clich&eacute;, it avoids it by focusing on lying, this is Fletcher's problem, he can't see his child because he just built his whole life, professional, social and familial, on lying. And when the kid gets one lie too much, he blows the candle of his birthday cake and makes the wish that his father can't lie during 24 hours, the curse applies immediately with the hilarious sex aftermath comment followed by the unforgettable drool-inducing elevator scene. Indeed, this scene speaks for all the men who tried to maintain eye-control in front of a nice pair of juicy  well, that's our mind whispering to us, and Fletcher's nightmare is that it's his mind controlling his words. And while transposing his case to my personal life, I wondered to what extent my life would have been different if I had one day without lying. I even shudder thinking to the eventuality of my wife asking me some questions about my past. Of course, it's just a film, but still. So, as soon as the curse operates, the movie takes off for a magnificent, flamboyant bravura performance from Jim Carrey, one gag after another, making the little archetypes, from the cute Justin Cooper with the worst haircut ever to Maura Tierney, the comprehensive divorced wife who still has feelings toward her ex-husband and the dull and boring replacer, Cary Elwes doing well in a rather ungrateful role, not to mention the scene-stealing Jennifer Tilly as the slutty ambitious unfaithful wife, they all become insignificant, because it's Carrey's film. And Carrey carries it with the power of his face, and a terrific script, one that visits every kind of situation where the 'to lie or not to lie' dilemma plays a pivotal role, even one that allows Fletcher to relieve himself by roasting everyone during an unforgettable board meeting, literally the film's laugh-out-loudest moment. And we catch our breath during some genuine moments of true father- and-son tenderness showcasing an unknown capability for seriousness, something the previous movies didn't show. And "Liar, Liar" probably played a vital and pivotal role in Carrey's career, proving he was at ease with slapstick humor (damn, I can't get the face he had with the luggage thing stuck in his face) and emotions too, a versatility that would be confirmed in "The Truman Show" one year later. And "Liar, Liar" concludes with a nice moral, if you build your life on lies, it might collapse sooner or later, if did for Fletcher, but the essential remained, and he would finally value it.

    Jim Carrey does have a gift for slapstick comedy, making you laugh all the way to the bank, this is the second of the three movies that Tom Shadyac and Jim Carrey made together and to me it is also my second favorite after Bruce Almighty but before Ace Ventura. The thing for me is that Liar Lair, didn't strike as a very funny movie, after a while the slapstick humor become more annoying than it was entertaining. The storyline which has a sticking resemblance to a Twilight series episode which will be easy to catch by twilight fans, had the tale of not being able to lie for just 24 hours, while the Twilight series episode was about the protagonist not being able to lie as long as he owned a car or something. The movie plot is about a chronic liar and divorc&eacute;e who has wrecked his home with his insensitivity, and his carelessness.

Like all other Tom and Carrey movies it was a box office hit, recouping its production cost and more. This is not my favorite Carrey movie and as I have said not my favorite of his duo with Tom Shadyac but Liar Liar has its moments.

The story is simply magnificent! It is like a story from a children's storybook, a book of old fairy tales. It's so amazingly brilliant and clever, I am actually out of words. No kidding! The story is so touching. It's the story of the love between father and son, mixed with jealousy, scumbags, Jim Carrey and the truth. It is a masterpiece of a movie! I have seen it several times before and still I did not mind watching it again. Actually, it was as if I had never seen it before. The acting in this movie is no less than the one of a master. Jim Carrey is a true legend. He is one of the funniest persons in the history of funny persons. He is one of the best comedians this world has ever seen. His humor is like no other. His acting indescribably unique and utter genius. He is beyond comparison! His brilliancy is also previewed in other movies, such as, "Ace Ventura: The Pet Detective", "Bruce Almighty", "A series of unfortunate events", "Yes man". And around the Christmas holidays, we think of "A Christmas Carol" and "The Grinch" of course. Timeless classics! Last time I checked Mr. Carrey was the 69th highest ranked actor in the world according to www.IMDb.com. I am not surprised by this, but I am surprised he is not ranked higher. He is nothing short of a genius! He is one of my favorite actors. Along with Jackie Chan, Mark Vincent (AKA Vin Diesel), Will Smith, Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Owen Wilson, Leo DiCaprio, Johnny Depp (definitely) and many more. Anywho, my point is this. "Liar, Liar" is a great movie and I couldn't find a single negative thing to say about it, therefore, I give it 10/10 stars. 100%. Yup, that is correct. That is my opinion and I am sticking to it.

    This movie is very much and example of a Jim Carrey film where Carrey runs rough shod over the script and puts on a one man comedy show. The results of this is very funny. The thing is it is one of many films that establishes Carey as a sort of Jerry Lewis for this generation. His manic comedy is very much like Lewis was in his prime. Carrey has a lot of energy here as a Lawyer who has to tell the truth for 24 hours due to his sons wish. There is some Lewis type schmaltz in his sympathy for the kiddies. In a way Carrey came along at the right time because his manic humor can include adult themes more in the 1990's where Jerry Lewis was more limited by censors what he could do. This gives Carrey's Comedy more bite than Lewis could have in his movies. For example he can tell a woman she has big... where Lewis would just be able to mug a va va voom in his movies. Carrey is very funny when he does his stuff. That is the main reason to

    Ever since societies existed, lies could either be the drivers or killers of human relationships, but I guess we have to blame it on truth. The trick with the truth is that sometimes we want to tell it but not to hear it, or vice versa. Do we really want to know what is said about us at the third person? Truth is a social double-edged sword, and lying a psychic boomerang, hitting you in the face when you don't expect it. This is why the main premise of a film like "Liar, Liar" where a man endures the curse of not lying, worse: not being able to articulate one lousy syllabic that wouldn't tell the truth is not only hilarious, but intellectually challenging, as it incites us to question the place 'lying', occupies in our lives and daily agendas... and occasionally on America's judiciary system. Indeed, maybe the fact that the story focuses on a slick lawyer in Los Angeles, a sort of Lionel Hutz in flesh and blood and competence, asks a bit too much on the suspension of disbelief department, still what a premise, the kind that probably started with a simple "what if" question and one wondered how no one ever got this idea before. It seems so clever, yet so simple, but it's not a laugh-riot guarantee either, my guess is that it's the kind of plot premises that can only work if you have the comical performance to efficiently conduct it from paper to screens. Think about that, "a man can't lie", so what, what is funny? The fact that he can't lie can easily become redundant; it's all in the diversity of reactions then. And who's better than Jim Carrey to takes you by surprises even when you expect to laugh? Only Carrey could have been so hilariously, pathetically, frantically funny in his desperate attempts to let one single lie comes out of his mouth, especially the day of a very tough divorce and child custody trial. Jim Carrey delivers his funniest performance, and certainly one of the funniest of the 90's, Adam Sandler? Chris Farley? "Liar, Liar" is the ultimate proof that Carrey is the real thing when it comes to comedy. Carrey's face is a gift from Cinematic Gods, hell, you don't even need CGI, it's like every parcel of his face is capable of displaying more hilarious elasticity than all the comics of his generation combined in all of their films. "Liar, Liar" is 80 minutes of demonstration, of Carrey's talent and comical superiority. Naturally, it's not just all about grimaces, funny faces or scream, like the best comedies, "Liar, Liar" has a heart and maintains an overwhelming everyday feeling, we're enjoying Carrey's talent, but still, we think of our own lives or lies. Marking the return of Jim Carrey after the film 'that almost ruined his career' according to Homer Simpson, "Liar, Liar" is the second collaboration with Tom Shadyak after "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" in 1994, the breakthrough year where he starred in 3 movies from the Box- office Top 10. He made it again with "Liar, Liar", for all the zaniness, Jim Carrey played a more mature, and identifiable character through Fletcher Reed, half liar, half lawyer (a clever opening joke probably lost in translation in all the foreign versions). While it does flirt a little bit with the too-busy-to-see-his-son father clich&eacute;, it avoids it by focusing on lying, this is Fletcher's problem, he can't see his child because he just built his whole life, professional, social and familial, on lying. And when the kid gets one lie too much, he blows the candle of his birthday cake and makes the wish that his father can't lie during 24 hours, the curse applies immediately with the hilarious sex aftermath comment followed by the unforgettable drool-inducing elevator scene. Indeed, this scene speaks for all the men who tried to maintain eye-control in front of a nice pair of juicy  well, that's our mind whispering to us, and Fletcher's nightmare is that it's his mind controlling his words. And while transposing his case to my personal life, I wondered to what extent my life would have been different if I had one day without lying. I even shudder thinking to the eventuality of my wife asking me some questions about my past. Of course, it's just a film, but still. So, as soon as the curse operates, the movie takes off for a magnificent, flamboyant bravura performance from Jim Carrey, one gag after another, making the little archetypes, from the cute Justin Cooper with the worst haircut ever to Maura Tierney, the comprehensive divorced wife who still has feelings toward her ex-husband and the dull and boring replacer, Cary Elwes doing well in a rather ungrateful role, not to mention the scene-stealing Jennifer Tilly as the slutty ambitious unfaithful wife, they all become insignificant, because it's Carrey's film. And Carrey carries it with the power of his face, and a terrific script, one that visits every kind of situation where the 'to lie or not to lie' dilemma plays a pivotal role, even one that allows Fletcher to relieve himself by roasting everyone during an unforgettable board meeting, literally the film's laugh-out-loudest moment. And we catch our breath during some genuine moments of true father- and-son tenderness showcasing an unknown capability for seriousness, something the previous movies didn't show. And "Liar, Liar" probably played a vital and pivotal role in Carrey's career, proving he was at ease with slapstick humor (damn, I can't get the face he had with the luggage thing stuck in his face) and emotions too, a versatility that would be confirmed in "The Truman Show" one year later. And "Liar, Liar" concludes with a nice moral, if you build your life on lies, it might collapse sooner or later, if did for Fletcher, but the essential remained, and he would finally value it.

    Jim Carrey does have a gift for slapstick comedy, making you laugh all the way to the bank, this is the second of the three movies that Tom Shadyac and Jim Carrey made together and to me it is also my second favorite after Bruce Almighty but before Ace Ventura. The thing for me is that Liar Lair, didn't strike as a very funny movie, after a while the slapstick humor become more annoying than it was entertaining. The storyline which has a sticking resemblance to a Twilight series episode which will be easy to catch by twilight fans, had the tale of not being able to lie for just 24 hours, while the Twilight series episode was about the protagonist not being able to lie as long as he owned a car or something. The movie plot is about a chronic liar and divorc&eacute;e who has wrecked his home with his insensitivity, and his carelessness. With only one thing that is true in his life Fletcher (Jim Carrey) was still finding it hard to meet up to expectations as his constant lying was costing him his relationship with his son Max (Justin Cooper). After Fletcher blew off his son's birthday party to have sex with his co-worker (lying that he had to work) Max decided to make a wish that his father will not be able to lie for a whole 24 hours. Now Fletcher is a lawyer, who has a multi-million dollar case that he is on at the moment, a case all built on lies and he is finding it difficult to keep at it, since he can't lie nor ask a question knowing full well that the answer is a lie. Well Liar Liar found a way to make a man who is insensitive and not caring find a way to have a happy ending, and all he did to learn his lesson was winning a case with some honest deductions, and chasing his son on a hijacked mobile stairway in an airport which landed him on a stretcher. Like all other Tom and Carrey movies it was a box office hit, recouping its production cost and more. This is not my favorite Carrey movie and as I have said not my favorite of his duo with Tom Shadyac but Liar Liar has its moments. So if you are jumping on the wagon of a Carrey DVD collection; you may want to consider this one, but mind you to me it is just there. www.lagsreviews.com

    Fletcher Reede (Jim Carrey) is a fast talking attorney, and he is an amazing perpetual liar. He is divorced from his wife Audrey (Maura Tierney). When he breaks his promise to his son to be at his birthday party, his son uses his birthday wish to make his father stop lying for one full day. Jerry (Cary Elwes) is Audrey's new boyfriend, and he wants to take her to Boston away from Fletcher. Jim Carrey is using all his skills both physical and verbal for this Jim Carrey vehicle. You have appreciate that he put so much energy in this performance. He's not a likable guy until he stops lying. If you can stick it out until then, he might just grow on you.

    Liar Liar **1/2 (out of 4) 86 mins/ 12 Cast: Jim Carrey, Maura Tierney, Justin Cooper, Cary Elwes, Anne Haney, Jennifer Tilly, Amanda Donohoe, Jason Bernard, Swoosie Kurtz, Mitch Ryan, Christopher Mayer, Eric Pierpoint Director: Tom Shadyac Plot: A boy of 5 wishes his father would stop lying and his wish comes true, with varying consequences. JJ's Verdict: Jim Carrey, at his rubber-faced best (or worst if you hate it, like me), manages to create a sweet and loving film that would actually be better off without him. The majority of his films are just vehicles for him with little plot, but this role wasn't written for him and actually has a good plot which Carrey unfortunately distracts you from. Liar Liar focuses on Carrey's Fletcher Redde, a fast-talking and outgoing lawyer who is ready to lie to win his case as quick as a flash. So when he lets down his 5- year-old son (Justin Cooper) yet again, making many lies in the process, the boy makes a birthday wish to prevent his dad from lying for a whole day. This wish comes true without any explanation and becomes problematic for Fletcher as he cannot lie during a case where the woman he is defending is certainly in the wrong. It is kind of ironic for Fletcher that although some aspects of his life go horribly wrong, his relationship with his son and wife improves drastically. Carrey, although he puts a huge amount of effort into the film, is just not funny when he goes into his ridiculous and over-the-top physical humour mode. Although it works when he is playing around with his son, it is just not a normal thing someone would do. He flaps his arms like crazy and pulls off almost impossible facial expressions but I'm afraid he just isn't funny. In fact the only time he is funny, is a scene where he isn't jumping around everywhere but just talking. I wish he would do more of it because he is actually a very funny guy which shows off in the worryingly hilarious credits (worrying because it is probably the best part of the film). Liar Liar is a loving and actually quite cute film, which also gives us some decently entertaining court scenes. It is just a shame its lead actor doesn't suit the role he is given.

    This is the film that shot Jim Carrey to super-star status in the late 90s. Until he starred in this film, he had been in "Dumb and Dumber", "The Mask" and "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" to name a few. None of them are quite as funny or entertaining as "Liar Liar." It's basically the story of a lawyer who lies quite often, until on his son's birthday, there is a wish made for him to not lie for one day. My, the things that occur! Carrey stars as Fletcher Reede, a defense attorney who wins his cases by having the defendants lie. His life is turned upside down however, after his son's magical wish comes true. He realizes afterward that it is family that matters most, not his work. The film sends a good message to parents about not lying to your children.

    Liar Liar is a hilarious comedy about a career-focused attorney, Fletcher Reede, who has a bad habit of lying in his personal as well as professional life. Ultimately, Fletcher's son, Max, becomes fed up with his father's lies and inconsistencies and decides to put an end to it using a birthday wish. Max wishes that for one day his father cannot tell a lie. Max's wish comes true setting forth a series of hysterical events and circumstances for Fletcher. This turn of events seems like a miracle to Max who can no longer be hurt by Fletcher's lies, but where Fletcher struggles the most is in his profession. Fletcher's strong reputation as a defense attorney is based significantly on his impressive lying skills, a theme that is portrayed throughout the entire film. (The word "liar" is even used as a pun on the word "lawyer" in the very first scene of the film.) Fletcher's professional performance is basically rendered nonexistent without the ability to lie, mislead, or withhold a truthful answer. Fletcher's struggle is most evident during the trial of an extremely important divorce case Fletcher plans on winning by having his client commit perjury on the stand. But Fletcher cannot even ask a question if he knows the answer is a lie. The film continues to focus on Fletcher's predicament as an attorney with the inability to lie. At the end of his struggle, but before the day has ended, Fletcher ultimately has a change of conscience about the way he has been living his life. He realizes that he has been living senselessly and that Max is his first and most important priority. Although the comedy is over the top at times, Jim Carrey plays the role perfectly and is as hilarious as he's ever been. I mean, how could we expect anything different? I laugh constantly every time I watch this movie and feel like it never gets old. I recommend it every chance I get!

    My mother, my late aunt, and I picked up this movie because we thought it was going to be good. The concept might have worked, but the problem was that Jim Carrey spoiled everything by his extreme facial mugging. We compared him to Jerry Lewis, whom he was trying to imitate, but even Lewis never twisted his face around so much like Carrey kept doing in this movie. After a half hour, we got sick of it and unloaded the video. It's a high-concept idea, and perhaps could have worked if some other actor had done the job. If instead of twisting his face around to an extreme when he couldn't give a false answer to a question in a courtroom, the lawyer might have used a more subtle way of showing he couldn't talk, the movie might have had some laughs. But this movie had me choose to avoid any movies with Jim Carrey in it if possible. And that was the lesson I took from "Liar Liar".

This is not my favorite Carrey movie and as I have said not my favorite of his duo with Tom Shadyac but Liar Liar has its moments. So if you are jumping on the wagon of a Carrey DVD collection; you may want to consider this one, but mind you to me it is just there. www.lagsreviews.com

    Fletcher Reede (Jim Carrey) is a fast talking attorney, and he is an amazing perpetual liar. He is divorced from his wife Audrey (Maura Tierney). When he breaks his promise to his son to be at his birthday party, his son uses his birthday wish to make his father stop lying for one full day. Jerry (Cary Elwes) is Audrey's new boyfriend, and he wants to take her to Boston away from Fletcher. Jim Carrey is using all his skills both physical and verbal for this Jim Carrey vehicle. You have appreciate that he put so much energy in this performance. He's not a likable guy until he stops lying. If you can stick it out until then, he might just grow on you.

    Liar Liar **1/2 (out of 4) 86 mins/ 12 Cast: Jim Carrey, Maura Tierney, Justin Cooper, Cary Elwes, Anne Haney, Jennifer Tilly, Amanda Donohoe, Jason Bernard, Swoosie Kurtz, Mitch Ryan, Christopher Mayer, Eric Pierpoint Director: Tom Shadyac Plot: A boy of 5 wishes his father would stop lying and his wish comes true, with varying consequences. JJ's Verdict: Jim Carrey, at his rubber-faced best (or worst if you hate it, like me), manages to create a sweet and loving film that would actually be better off without him. The majority of his films are just vehicles for him with little plot, but this role wasn't written for him and actually has a good plot which Carrey unfortunately distracts you from. Liar Liar focuses on Carrey's Fletcher Redde, a fast-talking and outgoing lawyer who is ready to lie to win his case as quick as a flash. So when he lets down his 5- year-old son (Justin Cooper) yet again, making many lies in the process, the boy makes a birthday wish to prevent his dad from lying for a whole day. This wish comes true without any explanation and becomes problematic for Fletcher as he cannot lie during a case where the woman he is defending is certainly in the wrong. It is kind of ironic for Fletcher that although some aspects of his life go horribly wrong, his relationship with his son and wife improves drastically. Carrey, although he puts a huge amount of effort into the film, is just not funny when he goes into his ridiculous and over-the-top physical humour mode. Although it works when he is playing around with his son, it is just not a normal thing someone would do. He flaps his arms like crazy and pulls off almost impossible facial expressions but I'm afraid he just isn't funny. In fact the only time he is funny, is a scene where he isn't jumping around everywhere but just talking. I wish he would do more of it because he is actually a very funny guy which shows off in the worryingly hilarious credits (worrying because it is probably the best part of the film). Liar Liar is a loving and actually quite cute film, which also gives us some decently entertaining court scenes. It is just a shame its lead actor doesn't suit the role he is given.

    This is the film that shot Jim Carrey to super-star status in the late 90s. Until he starred in this film, he had been in "Dumb and Dumber", "The Mask" and "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" to name a few. None of them are quite as funny or entertaining as "Liar Liar." It's basically the story of a lawyer who lies quite often, until on his son's birthday, there is a wish made for him to not lie for one day. My, the things that occur! Carrey stars as Fletcher Reede, a defense attorney who wins his cases by having the defendants lie. His life is turned upside down however, after his son's magical wish comes true. He realizes afterward that it is family that matters most, not his work. The film sends a good message to parents about not lying to your children.

    Liar Liar is a hilarious comedy about a career-focused attorney, Fletcher Reede, who has a bad habit of lying in his personal as well as professional life. Ultimately, Fletcher's son, Max, becomes fed up with his father's lies and inconsistencies and decides to put an end to it using a birthday wish. Max wishes that for one day his father cannot tell a lie. Max's wish comes true setting forth a series of hysterical events and circumstances for Fletcher. This turn of events seems like a miracle to Max who can no longer be hurt by Fletcher's lies, but where Fletcher struggles the most is in his profession. Fletcher's strong reputation as a defense attorney is based significantly on his impressive lying skills, a theme that is portrayed throughout the entire film. (The word "liar" is even used as a pun on the word "lawyer" in the very first scene of the film.) Fletcher's professional performance is basically rendered nonexistent without the ability to lie, mislead, or withhold a truthful answer. Fletcher's struggle is most evident during the trial of an extremely important divorce case Fletcher plans on winning by having his client commit perjury on the stand. But Fletcher cannot even ask a question if he knows the answer is a lie. The film continues to focus on Fletcher's predicament as an attorney with the inability to lie. At the end of his struggle, but before the day has ended, Fletcher ultimately has a change of conscience about the way he has been living his life. He realizes that he has been living senselessly and that Max is his first and most important priority. Although the comedy is over the top at times, Jim Carrey plays the role perfectly and is as hilarious as he's ever been. I mean, how could we expect anything different? I laugh constantly every time I watch this movie and feel like it never gets old. I recommend it every chance I get!

    My mother, my late aunt, and I picked up this movie because we thought it was going to be good. The concept might have worked, but the problem was that Jim Carrey spoiled everything by his extreme facial mugging. We compared him to Jerry Lewis, whom he was trying to imitate, but even Lewis never twisted his face around so much like Carrey kept doing in this movie. After a half hour, we got sick of it and unloaded the video. It's a high-concept idea, and perhaps could have worked if some other actor had done the job. If instead of twisting his face around to an extreme when he couldn't give a false answer to a question in a courtroom, the lawyer might have used a more subtle way of showing he couldn't talk, the movie might have had some laughs. But this movie had me choose to avoid any movies with Jim Carrey in it if possible. And that was the lesson I took from "Liar Liar".

    This movie is brilliant! Simply brilliant! It is so hilarious, and so funny, words can not begin to describe it. Even though I know it to be impossible I will give it a shot. The story is simply magnificent! It is like a story from a children's storybook, a book of old fairy tales. It's so amazingly brilliant and clever, I am actually out of words. No kidding! The story is so touching. It's the story of the love between father and son, mixed with jealousy, scumbags, Jim Carrey and the truth. It is a masterpiece of a movie! I have seen it several times before and still I did not mind watching it again. Actually, it was as if I had never seen it before. The acting in this movie is no less than the one of a master. Jim Carrey is a true legend. He is one of the funniest persons in the history of funny persons. He is one of the best comedians this world has ever seen. His humor is like no other. His acting indescribably unique and utter genius. He is beyond comparison! His brilliancy is also previewed in other movies, such as, "Ace Ventura: The Pet Detective", "Bruce Almighty", "A series of unfortunate events", "Yes man". And around the Christmas holidays, we think of "A Christmas Carol" and "The Grinch" of course. Timeless classics! Last time I checked Mr. Carrey was the 69th highest ranked actor in the world according to www.IMDb.com. I am not surprised by this, but I am surprised he is not ranked higher. He is nothing short of a genius! He is one of my favorite actors. Along with Jackie Chan, Mark Vincent (AKA Vin Diesel), Will Smith, Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Owen Wilson, Leo DiCaprio, Johnny Depp (definitely) and many more. Anywho, my point is this. "Liar, Liar" is a great movie and I couldn't find a single negative thing to say about it, therefore, I give it 10/10 stars. 100%. Yup, that is correct. That is my opinion and I am sticking to it. Bon Soir. Guten Nacth. Buenos Noches. Goodnight. God natt. - Shevy

    This movie is very much and example of a Jim Carrey film where Carrey runs rough shod over the script and puts on a one man comedy show. The results of this is very funny. The thing is it is one of many films that establishes Carey as a sort of Jerry Lewis for this generation. His manic comedy is very much like Lewis was in his prime. Carrey has a lot of energy here as a Lawyer who has to tell the truth for 24 hours due to his sons wish. There is some Lewis type schmaltz in his sympathy for the kiddies. In a way Carrey came along at the right time because his manic humor can include adult themes more in the 1990's where Jerry Lewis was more limited by censors what he could do. This gives Carrey's Comedy more bite than Lewis could have in his movies. For example he can tell a woman she has big... where Lewis would just be able to mug a va va voom in his movies. Carrey is very funny when he does his stuff. That is the main reason to

    Ever since societies existed, lies could either be the drivers or killers of human relationships, but I guess we have to blame it on truth. The trick with the truth is that sometimes we want to tell it but not to hear it, or vice versa. Do we really want to know what is said about us at the third person? Truth is a social double-edged sword, and lying a psychic boomerang, hitting you in the face when you don't expect it. This is why the main premise of a film like "Liar, Liar" where a man endures the curse of not lying, worse: not being able to articulate one lousy syllabic that wouldn't tell the truth is not only hilarious, but intellectually challenging, as it incites us to question the place 'lying', occupies in our lives and daily agendas... and occasionally on America's judiciary system. Indeed, maybe the fact that the story focuses on a slick lawyer in Los Angeles, a sort of Lionel Hutz in flesh and blood and competence, asks a bit too much on the suspension of disbelief department, still what a premise, the kind that probably started with a simple "what if" question and one wondered how no one ever got this idea before. It seems so clever, yet so simple, but it's not a laugh-riot guarantee either, my guess is that it's the kind of plot premises that can only work if you have the comical performance to efficiently conduct it from paper to screens. Think about that, "a man can't lie", so what, what is funny? The fact that he can't lie can easily become redundant; it's all in the diversity of reactions then. And who's better than Jim Carrey to takes you by surprises even when you expect to laugh? Only Carrey could have been so hilariously, pathetically, frantically funny in his desperate attempts to let one single lie comes out of his mouth, especially the day of a very tough divorce and child custody trial. Jim Carrey delivers his funniest performance, and certainly one of the funniest of the 90's, Adam Sandler? Chris Farley? "Liar, Liar" is the ultimate proof that Carrey is the real thing when it comes to comedy. Carrey's face is a gift from Cinematic Gods, hell, you don't even need CGI, it's like every parcel of his face is capable of displaying more hilarious elasticity than all the comics of his generation combined in all of their films. "Liar, Liar" is 80 minutes of demonstration, of Carrey's talent and comical superiority. Naturally, it's not just all about grimaces, funny faces or scream, like the best comedies, "Liar, Liar" has a heart and maintains an overwhelming everyday feeling, we're enjoying Carrey's talent, but still, we think of our own lives or lies. Marking the return of Jim Carrey after the film 'that almost ruined his career' according to Homer Simpson, "Liar, Liar" is the second collaboration with Tom Shadyak after "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" in 1994, the breakthrough year where he starred in 3 movies from the Box- office Top 10. He made it again with "Liar, Liar", for all the zaniness, Jim Carrey played a more mature, and identifiable character through Fletcher Reed, half liar, half lawyer (a clever opening joke probably lost in translation in all the foreign versions). While it does flirt a little bit with the too-busy-to-see-his-son father clich&eacute;, it avoids it by focusing on lying, this is Fletcher's problem, he can't see his child because he just built his whole life, professional, social and familial, on lying. And when the kid gets one lie too much, he blows the candle of his birthday cake and makes the wish that his father can't lie during 24 hours, the curse applies immediately with the hilarious sex aftermath comment followed by the unforgettable drool-inducing elevator scene. Indeed, this scene speaks for all the men who tried to maintain eye-control in front of a nice pair of juicy  well, that's our mind whispering to us, and Fletcher's nightmare is that it's his mind controlling his words. And while transposing his case to my personal life, I wondered to what extent my life would have been different if I had one day without lying. I even shudder thinking to the eventuality of my wife asking me some questions about my past. Of course, it's just a film, but still. So, as soon as the curse operates, the movie takes off for a magnificent, flamboyant bravura performance from Jim Carrey, one gag after another, making the little archetypes, from the cute Justin Cooper with the worst haircut ever to Maura Tierney, the comprehensive divorced wife who still has feelings toward her ex-husband and the dull and boring replacer, Cary Elwes doing well in a rather ungrateful role, not to mention the scene-stealing Jennifer Tilly as the slutty ambitious unfaithful wife, they all become insignificant, because it's Carrey's film. And Carrey carries it with the power of his face, and a terrific script, one that visits every kind of situation where the 'to lie or not to lie' dilemma plays a pivotal role, even one that allows Fletcher to relieve himself by roasting everyone during an unforgettable board meeting, literally the film's laugh-out-loudest moment. And we catch our breath during some genuine moments of true father- and-son tenderness showcasing an unknown capability for seriousness, something the previous movies didn't show. And "Liar, Liar" probably played a vital and pivotal role in Carrey's career, proving he was at ease with slapstick humor (damn, I can't get the face he had with the luggage thing stuck in his face) and emotions too, a versatility that would be confirmed in "The Truman Show" one year later. And "Liar, Liar" concludes with a nice moral, if you build your life on lies, it might collapse sooner or later, if did for Fletcher, but the essential remained, and he would finally value it.

    Jim Carrey does have a gift for slapstick comedy, making you laugh all the way to the bank, this is the second of the three movies that Tom Shadyac and Jim Carrey made together and to me it is also my second favorite after Bruce Almighty but before Ace Ventura. The thing for me is that Liar Lair, didn't strike as a very funny movie, after a while the slapstick humor become more annoying than it was entertaining. The storyline which has a sticking resemblance to a Twilight series episode which will be easy to catch by twilight fans, had the tale of not being able to lie for just 24 hours, while the Twilight series episode was about the protagonist not being able to lie as long as he owned a car or something. The movie plot is about a chronic liar and divorc&eacute;e who has wrecked his home with his insensitivity, and his carelessness. With only one thing that is true in his life Fletcher (Jim Carrey) was still finding it hard to meet up to expectations as his constant lying was costing him his relationship with his son Max (Justin Cooper). After Fletcher blew off his son's birthday party to have sex with his co-worker (lying that he had to work) Max decided to make a wish that his father will not be able to lie for a whole 24 hours. Now Fletcher is a lawyer, who has a multi-million dollar case that he is on at the moment, a case all built on lies and he is finding it difficult to keep at it, since he can't lie nor ask a question knowing full well that the answer is a lie. Well Liar Liar found a way to make a man who is insensitive and not caring find a way to have a happy ending, and all he did to learn his lesson was winning a case with some honest deductions, and chasing his son on a hijacked mobile stairway in an airport which landed him on a stretcher. Like all other Tom and Carrey movies it was a box office hit, recouping its production cost and more. This is not my favorite Carrey movie and as I have said not my favorite of his duo with Tom Shadyac but Liar Liar has its moments. So if you are jumping on the wagon of a Carrey DVD collection; you may want to consider this one, but mind you to me it is just there. www.lagsreviews.com

And around the Christmas holidays, we think of "A Christmas Carol" and "The Grinch" of course. Timeless classics! Last time I checked Mr. Carrey was the 69th highest ranked actor in the world according to www.IMDb.com. I am not surprised by this, but I am surprised he is not ranked higher. He is nothing short of a genius! He is one of my favorite actors. Along with Jackie Chan, Mark Vincent (AKA Vin Diesel), Will Smith, Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Owen Wilson, Leo DiCaprio, Johnny Depp (definitely) and many more. Anywho, my point is this. "Liar, Liar" is a great movie and I couldn't find a single negative thing to say about it, therefore, I give it 10/10 stars. 100%. Yup, that is correct. That is my opinion and I am sticking to it.

    This movie is very much and example of a Jim Carrey film where Carrey runs rough shod over the script and puts on a one man comedy show. The results of this is very funny. The thing is it is one of many films that establishes Carey as a sort of Jerry Lewis for this generation. His manic comedy is very much like Lewis was in his prime. Carrey has a lot of energy here as a Lawyer who has to tell the truth for 24 hours due to his sons wish. There is some Lewis type schmaltz in his sympathy for the kiddies. In a way Carrey came along at the right time because his manic humor can include adult themes more in the 1990's where Jerry Lewis was more limited by censors what he could do. This gives Carrey's Comedy more bite than Lewis could have in his movies. For example he can tell a woman she has big... where Lewis would just be able to mug a va va voom in his movies. Carrey is very funny when he does his stuff. That is the main reason to

    Ever since societies existed, lies could either be the drivers or killers of human relationships, but I guess we have to blame it on truth. The trick with the truth is that sometimes we want to tell it but not to hear it, or vice versa. Do we really want to know what is said about us at the third person? Truth is a social double-edged sword, and lying a psychic boomerang, hitting you in the face when you don't expect it. This is why the main premise of a film like "Liar, Liar" where a man endures the curse of not lying, worse: not being able to articulate one lousy syllabic that wouldn't tell the truth is not only hilarious, but intellectually challenging, as it incites us to question the place 'lying', occupies in our lives and daily agendas... and occasionally on America's judiciary system. Indeed, maybe the fact that the story focuses on a slick lawyer in Los Angeles, a sort of Lionel Hutz in flesh and blood and competence, asks a bit too much on the suspension of disbelief department, still what a premise, the kind that probably started with a simple "what if" question and one wondered how no one ever got this idea before. It seems so clever, yet so simple, but it's not a laugh-riot guarantee either, my guess is that it's the kind of plot premises that can only work if you have the comical performance to efficiently conduct it from paper to screens. Think about that, "a man can't lie", so what, what is funny? The fact that he can't lie can easily become redundant; it's all in the diversity of reactions then. And who's better than Jim Carrey to takes you by surprises even when you expect to laugh? Only Carrey could have been so hilariously, pathetically, frantically funny in his desperate attempts to let one single lie comes out of his mouth, especially the day of a very tough divorce and child custody trial. Jim Carrey delivers his funniest performance, and certainly one of the funniest of the 90's, Adam Sandler? Chris Farley? "Liar, Liar" is the ultimate proof that Carrey is the real thing when it comes to comedy. Carrey's face is a gift from Cinematic Gods, hell, you don't even need CGI, it's like every parcel of his face is capable of displaying more hilarious elasticity than all the comics of his generation combined in all of their films. "Liar, Liar" is 80 minutes of demonstration, of Carrey's talent and comical superiority. Naturally, it's not just all about grimaces, funny faces or scream, like the best comedies, "Liar, Liar" has a heart and maintains an overwhelming everyday feeling, we're enjoying Carrey's talent, but still, we think of our own lives or lies. Marking the return of Jim Carrey after the film 'that almost ruined his career' according to Homer Simpson, "Liar, Liar" is the second collaboration with Tom Shadyak after "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" in 1994, the breakthrough year where he starred in 3 movies from the Box- office Top 10. He made it again with "Liar, Liar", for all the zaniness, Jim Carrey played a more mature, and identifiable character through Fletcher Reed, half liar, half lawyer (a clever opening joke probably lost in translation in all the foreign versions). While it does flirt a little bit with the too-busy-to-see-his-son father clich&eacute;, it avoids it by focusing on lying, this is Fletcher's problem, he can't see his child because he just built his whole life, professional, social and familial, on lying. And when the kid gets one lie too much, he blows the candle of his birthday cake and makes the wish that his father can't lie during 24 hours, the curse applies immediately with the hilarious sex aftermath comment followed by the unforgettable drool-inducing elevator scene. Indeed, this scene speaks for all the men who tried to maintain eye-control in front of a nice pair of juicy  well, that's our mind whispering to us, and Fletcher's nightmare is that it's his mind controlling his words. And while transposing his case to my personal life, I wondered to what extent my life would have been different if I had one day without lying. I even shudder thinking to the eventuality of my wife asking me some questions about my past. Of course, it's just a film, but still. So, as soon as the curse operates, the movie takes off for a magnificent, flamboyant bravura performance from Jim Carrey, one gag after another, making the little archetypes, from the cute Justin Cooper with the worst haircut ever to Maura Tierney, the comprehensive divorced wife who still has feelings toward her ex-husband and the dull and boring replacer, Cary Elwes doing well in a rather ungrateful role, not to mention the scene-stealing Jennifer Tilly as the slutty ambitious unfaithful wife, they all become insignificant, because it's Carrey's film. And Carrey carries it with the power of his face, and a terrific script, one that visits every kind of situation where the 'to lie or not to lie' dilemma plays a pivotal role, even one that allows Fletcher to relieve himself by roasting everyone during an unforgettable board meeting, literally the film's laugh-out-loudest moment. And we catch our breath during some genuine moments of true father- and-son tenderness showcasing an unknown capability for seriousness, something the previous movies didn't show. And "Liar, Liar" probably played a vital and pivotal role in Carrey's career, proving he was at ease with slapstick humor (damn, I can't get the face he had with the luggage thing stuck in his face) and emotions too, a versatility that would be confirmed in "The Truman Show" one year later. And "Liar, Liar" concludes with a nice moral, if you build your life on lies, it might collapse sooner or later, if did for Fletcher, but the essential remained, and he would finally value it.

    Jim Carrey does have a gift for slapstick comedy, making you laugh all the way to the bank, this is the second of the three movies that Tom Shadyac and Jim Carrey made together and to me it is also my second favorite after Bruce Almighty but before Ace Ventura. The thing for me is that Liar Lair, didn't strike as a very funny movie, after a while the slapstick humor become more annoying than it was entertaining. The storyline which has a sticking resemblance to a Twilight series episode which will be easy to catch by twilight fans, had the tale of not being able to lie for just 24 hours, while the Twilight series episode was about the protagonist not being able to lie as long as he owned a car or something. The movie plot is about a chronic liar and divorc&eacute;e who has wrecked his home with his insensitivity, and his carelessness. With only one thing that is true in his life Fletcher (Jim Carrey) was still finding it hard to meet up to expectations as his constant lying was costing him his relationship with his son Max (Justin Cooper). After Fletcher blew off his son's birthday party to have sex with his co-worker (lying that he had to work) Max decided to make a wish that his father will not be able to lie for a whole 24 hours. Now Fletcher is a lawyer, who has a multi-million dollar case that he is on at the moment, a case all built on lies and he is finding it difficult to keep at it, since he can't lie nor ask a question knowing full well that the answer is a lie. Well Liar Liar found a way to make a man who is insensitive and not caring find a way to have a happy ending, and all he did to learn his lesson was winning a case with some honest deductions, and chasing his son on a hijacked mobile stairway in an airport which landed him on a stretcher. Like all other Tom and Carrey movies it was a box office hit, recouping its production cost and more. This is not my favorite Carrey movie and as I have said not my favorite of his duo with Tom Shadyac but Liar Liar has its moments. So if you are jumping on the wagon of a Carrey DVD collection; you may want to consider this one, but mind you to me it is just there. www.lagsreviews.com

    Fletcher Reede (Jim Carrey) is a fast talking attorney, and he is an amazing perpetual liar. He is divorced from his wife Audrey (Maura Tierney). When he breaks his promise to his son to be at his birthday party, his son uses his birthday wish to make his father stop lying for one full day. Jerry (Cary Elwes) is Audrey's new boyfriend, and he wants to take her to Boston away from Fletcher. Jim Carrey is using all his skills both physical and verbal for this Jim Carrey vehicle. You have appreciate that he put so much energy in this performance. He's not a likable guy until he stops lying. If you can stick it out until then, he might just grow on you.

    Liar Liar **1/2 (out of 4) 86 mins/ 12 Cast: Jim Carrey, Maura Tierney, Justin Cooper, Cary Elwes, Anne Haney, Jennifer Tilly, Amanda Donohoe, Jason Bernard, Swoosie Kurtz, Mitch Ryan, Christopher Mayer, Eric Pierpoint Director: Tom Shadyac Plot: A boy of 5 wishes his father would stop lying and his wish comes true, with varying consequences. JJ's Verdict: Jim Carrey, at his rubber-faced best (or worst if you hate it, like me), manages to create a sweet and loving film that would actually be better off without him. The majority of his films are just vehicles for him with little plot, but this role wasn't written for him and actually has a good plot which Carrey unfortunately distracts you from. Liar Liar focuses on Carrey's Fletcher Redde, a fast-talking and outgoing lawyer who is ready to lie to win his case as quick as a flash. So when he lets down his 5- year-old son (Justin Cooper) yet again, making many lies in the process, the boy makes a birthday wish to prevent his dad from lying for a whole day. This wish comes true without any explanation and becomes problematic for Fletcher as he cannot lie during a case where the woman he is defending is certainly in the wrong. It is kind of ironic for Fletcher that although some aspects of his life go horribly wrong, his relationship with his son and wife improves drastically. Carrey, although he puts a huge amount of effort into the film, is just not funny when he goes into his ridiculous and over-the-top physical humour mode. Although it works when he is playing around with his son, it is just not a normal thing someone would do. He flaps his arms like crazy and pulls off almost impossible facial expressions but I'm afraid he just isn't funny. In fact the only time he is funny, is a scene where he isn't jumping around everywhere but just talking. I wish he would do more of it because he is actually a very funny guy which shows off in the worryingly hilarious credits (worrying because it is probably the best part of the film). Liar Liar is a loving and actually quite cute film, which also gives us some decently entertaining court scenes. It is just a shame its lead actor doesn't suit the role he is given.

    This is the film that shot Jim Carrey to super-star status in the late 90s. Until he starred in this film, he had been in "Dumb and Dumber", "The Mask" and "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" to name a few. None of them are quite as funny or entertaining as "Liar Liar." It's basically the story of a lawyer who lies quite often, until on his son's birthday, there is a wish made for him to not lie for one day. My, the things that occur! Carrey stars as Fletcher Reede, a defense attorney who wins his cases by having the defendants lie. His life is turned upside down however, after his son's magical wish comes true. He realizes afterward that it is family that matters most, not his work. The film sends a good message to parents about not lying to your children.

    Liar Liar is a hilarious comedy about a career-focused attorney, Fletcher Reede, who has a bad habit of lying in his personal as well as professional life. Ultimately, Fletcher's son, Max, becomes fed up with his father's lies and inconsistencies and decides to put an end to it using a birthday wish. Max wishes that for one day his father cannot tell a lie. Max's wish comes true setting forth a series of hysterical events and circumstances for Fletcher. This turn of events seems like a miracle to Max who can no longer be hurt by Fletcher's lies, but where Fletcher struggles the most is in his profession. Fletcher's strong reputation as a defense attorney is based significantly on his impressive lying skills, a theme that is portrayed throughout the entire film. (The word "liar" is even used as a pun on the word "lawyer" in the very first scene of the film.) Fletcher's professional performance is basically rendered nonexistent without the ability to lie, mislead, or withhold a truthful answer. Fletcher's struggle is most evident during the trial of an extremely important divorce case Fletcher plans on winning by having his client commit perjury on the stand. But Fletcher cannot even ask a question if he knows the answer is a lie. The film continues to focus on Fletcher's predicament as an attorney with the inability to lie. At the end of his struggle, but before the day has ended, Fletcher ultimately has a change of conscience about the way he has been living his life. He realizes that he has been living senselessly and that Max is his first and most important priority. Although the comedy is over the top at times, Jim Carrey plays the role perfectly and is as hilarious as he's ever been. I mean, how could we expect anything different? I laugh constantly every time I watch this movie and feel like it never gets old. I recommend it every chance I get!

    My mother, my late aunt, and I picked up this movie because we thought it was going to be good. The concept might have worked, but the problem was that Jim Carrey spoiled everything by his extreme facial mugging. We compared him to Jerry Lewis, whom he was trying to imitate, but even Lewis never twisted his face around so much like Carrey kept doing in this movie. After a half hour, we got sick of it and unloaded the video. It's a high-concept idea, and perhaps could have worked if some other actor had done the job. If instead of twisting his face around to an extreme when he couldn't give a false answer to a question in a courtroom, the lawyer might have used a more subtle way of showing he couldn't talk, the movie might have had some laughs. But this movie had me choose to avoid any movies with Jim Carrey in it if possible. And that was the lesson I took from "Liar Liar".

    This movie is brilliant! Simply brilliant! It is so hilarious, and so funny, words can not begin to describe it. Even though I know it to be impossible I will give it a shot. The story is simply magnificent! It is like a story from a children's storybook, a book of old fairy tales. It's so amazingly brilliant and clever, I am actually out of words. No kidding! The story is so touching. It's the story of the love between father and son, mixed with jealousy, scumbags, Jim Carrey and the truth. It is a masterpiece of a movie! I have seen it several times before and still I did not mind watching it again. Actually, it was as if I had never seen it before. The acting in this movie is no less than the one of a master. Jim Carrey is a true legend. He is one of the funniest persons in the history of funny persons. He is one of the best comedians this world has ever seen. His humor is like no other. His acting indescribably unique and utter genius. He is beyond comparison! His brilliancy is also previewed in other movies, such as, "Ace Ventura: The Pet Detective", "Bruce Almighty", "A series of unfortunate events", "Yes man". And around the Christmas holidays, we think of "A Christmas Carol" and "The Grinch" of course. Timeless classics!

Jerry (Cary Elwes) is Audrey's new boyfriend, and he wants to take her to Boston away from Fletcher. Jim Carrey is using all his skills both physical and verbal for this Jim Carrey vehicle. You have appreciate that he put so much energy in this performance. He's not a likable guy until he stops lying. If you can stick it out until then, he might just grow on you.

    Liar Liar **1/2 (out of 4) 86 mins/ 12 Cast: Jim Carrey, Maura Tierney, Justin Cooper, Cary Elwes, Anne Haney, Jennifer Tilly, Amanda Donohoe, Jason Bernard, Swoosie Kurtz, Mitch Ryan, Christopher Mayer, Eric Pierpoint Director: Tom Shadyac Plot: A boy of 5 wishes his father would stop lying and his wish comes true, with varying consequences. JJ's Verdict: Jim Carrey, at his rubber-faced best (or worst if you hate it, like me), manages to create a sweet and loving film that would actually be better off without him. The majority of his films are just vehicles for him with little plot, but this role wasn't written for him and actually has a good plot which Carrey unfortunately distracts you from. Liar Liar focuses on Carrey's Fletcher Redde, a fast-talking and outgoing lawyer who is ready to lie to win his case as quick as a flash. So when he lets down his 5- year-old son (Justin Cooper) yet again, making many lies in the process, the boy makes a birthday wish to prevent his dad from lying for a whole day. This wish comes true without any explanation and becomes problematic for Fletcher as he cannot lie during a case where the woman he is defending is certainly in the wrong. It is kind of ironic for Fletcher that although some aspects of his life go horribly wrong, his relationship with his son and wife improves drastically. Carrey, although he puts a huge amount of effort into the film, is just not funny when he goes into his ridiculous and over-the-top physical humour mode. Although it works when he is playing around with his son, it is just not a normal thing someone would do. He flaps his arms like crazy and pulls off almost impossible facial expressions but I'm afraid he just isn't funny. In fact the only time he is funny, is a scene where he isn't jumping around everywhere but just talking. I wish he would do more of it because he is actually a very funny guy which shows off in the worryingly hilarious credits (worrying because it is probably the best part of the film). Liar Liar is a loving and actually quite cute film, which also gives us some decently entertaining court scenes. It is just a shame its lead actor doesn't suit the role he is given.

    This is the film that shot Jim Carrey to super-star status in the late 90s. Until he starred in this film, he had been in "Dumb and Dumber", "The Mask" and "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" to name a few. None of them are quite as funny or entertaining as "Liar Liar." It's basically the story of a lawyer who lies quite often, until on his son's birthday, there is a wish made for him to not lie for one day. My, the things that occur! Carrey stars as Fletcher Reede, a defense attorney who wins his cases by having the defendants lie. His life is turned upside down however, after his son's magical wish comes true. He realizes afterward that it is family that matters most, not his work. The film sends a good message to parents about not lying to your children.

    Liar Liar is a hilarious comedy about a career-focused attorney, Fletcher Reede, who has a bad habit of lying in his personal as well as professional life. Ultimately, Fletcher's son, Max, becomes fed up with his father's lies and inconsistencies and decides to put an end to it using a birthday wish. Max wishes that for one day his father cannot tell a lie. Max's wish comes true setting forth a series of hysterical events and circumstances for Fletcher. This turn of events seems like a miracle to Max who can no longer be hurt by Fletcher's lies, but where Fletcher struggles the most is in his profession. Fletcher's strong reputation as a defense attorney is based significantly on his impressive lying skills, a theme that is portrayed throughout the entire film. (The word "liar" is even used as a pun on the word "lawyer" in the very first scene of the film.) Fletcher's professional performance is basically rendered nonexistent without the ability to lie, mislead, or withhold a truthful answer. Fletcher's struggle is most evident during the trial of an extremely important divorce case Fletcher plans on winning by having his client commit perjury on the stand. But Fletcher cannot even ask a question if he knows the answer is a lie. The film continues to focus on Fletcher's predicament as an attorney with the inability to lie. At the end of his struggle, but before the day has ended, Fletcher ultimately has a change of conscience about the way he has been living his life. He realizes that he has been living senselessly and that Max is his first and most important priority. Although the comedy is over the top at times, Jim Carrey plays the role perfectly and is as hilarious as he's ever been. I mean, how could we expect anything different? I laugh constantly every time I watch this movie and feel like it never gets old. I recommend it every chance I get!

    My mother, my late aunt, and I picked up this movie because we thought it was going to be good. The concept might have worked, but the problem was that Jim Carrey spoiled everything by his extreme facial mugging. We compared him to Jerry Lewis, whom he was trying to imitate, but even Lewis never twisted his face around so much like Carrey kept doing in this movie. After a half hour, we got sick of it and unloaded the video. It's a high-concept idea, and perhaps could have worked if some other actor had done the job. If instead of twisting his face around to an extreme when he couldn't give a false answer to a question in a courtroom, the lawyer might have used a more subtle way of showing he couldn't talk, the movie might have had some laughs. But this movie had me choose to avoid any movies with Jim Carrey in it if possible. And that was the lesson I took from "Liar Liar".

    This movie is brilliant! Simply brilliant! It is so hilarious, and so funny, words can not begin to describe it. Even though I know it to be impossible I will give it a shot. The story is simply magnificent! It is like a story from a children's storybook, a book of old fairy tales. It's so amazingly brilliant and clever, I am actually out of words. No kidding! The story is so touching. It's the story of the love between father and son, mixed with jealousy, scumbags, Jim Carrey and the truth. It is a masterpiece of a movie! I have seen it several times before and still I did not mind watching it again. Actually, it was as if I had never seen it before. The acting in this movie is no less than the one of a master. Jim Carrey is a true legend. He is one of the funniest persons in the history of funny persons. He is one of the best comedians this world has ever seen. His humor is like no other. His acting indescribably unique and utter genius. He is beyond comparison! His brilliancy is also previewed in other movies, such as, "Ace Ventura: The Pet Detective", "Bruce Almighty", "A series of unfortunate events", "Yes man". And around the Christmas holidays, we think of "A Christmas Carol" and "The Grinch" of course. Timeless classics! Last time I checked Mr. Carrey was the 69th highest ranked actor in the world according to www.IMDb.com. I am not surprised by this, but I am surprised he is not ranked higher. He is nothing short of a genius! He is one of my favorite actors. Along with Jackie Chan, Mark Vincent (AKA Vin Diesel), Will Smith, Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Owen Wilson, Leo DiCaprio, Johnny Depp (definitely) and many more. Anywho, my point is this. "Liar, Liar" is a great movie and I couldn't find a single negative thing to say about it, therefore, I give it 10/10 stars. 100%. Yup, that is correct. That is my opinion and I am sticking to it. Bon Soir. Guten Nacth. Buenos Noches. Goodnight. God natt. - Shevy

    This movie is very much and example of a Jim Carrey film where Carrey runs rough shod over the script and puts on a one man comedy show. The results of this is very funny. The thing is it is one of many films that establishes Carey as a sort of Jerry Lewis for this generation. His manic comedy is very much like Lewis was in his prime. Carrey has a lot of energy here as a Lawyer who has to tell the truth for 24 hours due to his sons wish. There is some Lewis type schmaltz in his sympathy for the kiddies. In a way Carrey came along at the right time because his manic humor can include adult themes more in the 1990's where Jerry Lewis was more limited by censors what he could do. This gives Carrey's Comedy more bite than Lewis could have in his movies. For example he can tell a woman she has big... where Lewis would just be able to mug a va va voom in his movies. Carrey is very funny when he does his stuff. That is the main reason to

    Ever since societies existed, lies could either be the drivers or killers of human relationships, but I guess we have to blame it on truth. The trick with the truth is that sometimes we want to tell it but not to hear it, or vice versa. Do we really want to know what is said about us at the third person? Truth is a social double-edged sword, and lying a psychic boomerang, hitting you in the face when you don't expect it. This is why the main premise of a film like "Liar, Liar" where a man endures the curse of not lying, worse: not being able to articulate one lousy syllabic that wouldn't tell the truth is not only hilarious, but intellectually challenging, as it incites us to question the place 'lying', occupies in our lives and daily agendas... and occasionally on America's judiciary system. Indeed, maybe the fact that the story focuses on a slick lawyer in Los Angeles, a sort of Lionel Hutz in flesh and blood and competence, asks a bit too much on the suspension of disbelief department, still what a premise, the kind that probably started with a simple "what if" question and one wondered how no one ever got this idea before. It seems so clever, yet so simple, but it's not a laugh-riot guarantee either, my guess is that it's the kind of plot premises that can only work if you have the comical performance to efficiently conduct it from paper to screens. Think about that, "a man can't lie", so what, what is funny? The fact that he can't lie can easily become redundant; it's all in the diversity of reactions then. And who's better than Jim Carrey to takes you by surprises even when you expect to laugh? Only Carrey could have been so hilariously, pathetically, frantically funny in his desperate attempts to let one single lie comes out of his mouth, especially the day of a very tough divorce and child custody trial. Jim Carrey delivers his funniest performance, and certainly one of the funniest of the 90's, Adam Sandler? Chris Farley? "Liar, Liar" is the ultimate proof that Carrey is the real thing when it comes to comedy. Carrey's face is a gift from Cinematic Gods, hell, you don't even need CGI, it's like every parcel of his face is capable of displaying more hilarious elasticity than all the comics of his generation combined in all of their films. "Liar, Liar" is 80 minutes of demonstration, of Carrey's talent and comical superiority. Naturally, it's not just all about grimaces, funny faces or scream, like the best comedies, "Liar, Liar" has a heart and maintains an overwhelming everyday feeling, we're enjoying Carrey's talent, but still, we think of our own lives or lies. Marking the return of Jim Carrey after the film 'that almost ruined his career' according to Homer Simpson, "Liar, Liar" is the second collaboration with Tom Shadyak after "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" in 1994, the breakthrough year where he starred in 3 movies from the Box- office Top 10. He made it again with "Liar, Liar", for all the zaniness, Jim Carrey played a more mature, and identifiable character through Fletcher Reed, half liar, half lawyer (a clever opening joke probably lost in translation in all the foreign versions). While it does flirt a little bit with the too-busy-to-see-his-son father clich&eacute;, it avoids it by focusing on lying, this is Fletcher's problem, he can't see his child because he just built his whole life, professional, social and familial, on lying. And when the kid gets one lie too much, he blows the candle of his birthday cake and makes the wish that his father can't lie during 24 hours, the curse applies immediately with the hilarious sex aftermath comment followed by the unforgettable drool-inducing elevator scene. Indeed, this scene speaks for all the men who tried to maintain eye-control in front of a nice pair of juicy  well, that's our mind whispering to us, and Fletcher's nightmare is that it's his mind controlling his words. And while transposing his case to my personal life, I wondered to what extent my life would have been different if I had one day without lying. I even shudder thinking to the eventuality of my wife asking me some questions about my past. Of course, it's just a film, but still. So, as soon as the curse operates, the movie takes off for a magnificent, flamboyant bravura performance from Jim Carrey, one gag after another, making the little archetypes, from the cute Justin Cooper with the worst haircut ever to Maura Tierney, the comprehensive divorced wife who still has feelings toward her ex-husband and the dull and boring replacer, Cary Elwes doing well in a rather ungrateful role, not to mention the scene-stealing Jennifer Tilly as the slutty ambitious unfaithful wife, they all become insignificant, because it's Carrey's film. And Carrey carries it with the power of his face, and a terrific script, one that visits every kind of situation where the 'to lie or not to lie' dilemma plays a pivotal role, even one that allows Fletcher to relieve himself by roasting everyone during an unforgettable board meeting, literally the film's laugh-out-loudest moment. And we catch our breath during some genuine moments of true father- and-son tenderness showcasing an unknown capability for seriousness, something the previous movies didn't show. And "Liar, Liar" probably played a vital and pivotal role in Carrey's career, proving he was at ease with slapstick humor (damn, I can't get the face he had with the luggage thing stuck in his face) and emotions too, a versatility that would be confirmed in "The Truman Show" one year later. And "Liar, Liar" concludes with a nice moral, if you build your life on lies, it might collapse sooner or later, if did for Fletcher, but the essential remained, and he would finally value it.

    Jim Carrey does have a gift for slapstick comedy, making you laugh all the way to the bank, this is the second of the three movies that Tom Shadyac and Jim Carrey made together and to me it is also my second favorite after Bruce Almighty but before Ace Ventura. The thing for me is that Liar Lair, didn't strike as a very funny movie, after a while the slapstick humor become more annoying than it was entertaining. The storyline which has a sticking resemblance to a Twilight series episode which will be easy to catch by twilight fans, had the tale of not being able to lie for just 24 hours, while the Twilight series episode was about the protagonist not being able to lie as long as he owned a car or something. The movie plot is about a chronic liar and divorc&eacute;e who has wrecked his home with his insensitivity, and his carelessness. With only one thing that is true in his life Fletcher (Jim Carrey) was still finding it hard to meet up to expectations as his constant lying was costing him his relationship with his son Max (Justin Cooper). After Fletcher blew off his son's birthday party to have sex with his co-worker (lying that he had to work) Max decided to make a wish that his father will not be able to lie for a whole 24 hours. Now Fletcher is a lawyer, who has a multi-million dollar case that he is on at the moment, a case all built on lies and he is finding it difficult to keep at it, since he can't lie nor ask a question knowing full well that the answer is a lie. Well Liar Liar found a way to make a man who is insensitive and not caring find a way to have a happy ending, and all he did to learn his lesson was winning a case with some honest deductions, and chasing his son on a hijacked mobile stairway in an airport which landed him on a stretcher. Like all other Tom and Carrey movies it was a box office hit, recouping its production cost and more. This is not my favorite Carrey movie and as I have said not my favorite of his duo with Tom Shadyac but Liar Liar has its moments. So if you are jumping on the wagon of a Carrey DVD collection; you may want to consider this one, but mind you to me it is just there. www.lagsreviews.com
