    In the popular TV series of the same name (1963-1967), David Janssen played the lead role of a doctor who had been tried, convicted, and sentenced to die for the murder of his wife. The doctor, Richard Kimble, was innocent of the crime. Because of a train wreck, Kimble was able to escape and subsequently search for the one-armed man that he knew was the real culprit. Folks tuned in every week to see how the doctor fared. Despite many close calls and being fanatically pursued by a relentless Lt. Gerard, Kimble remained elusive. Finally, after four years, Kimble and his quarry were trapped atop a water tower in the presence of Gerard, who shot the one-armed murderer from the ground. That final episode on a Tuesday in August of 1967 garnered a 72 percent share of all USA TV viewers. The 1993 movie of the same name maintains the same premise although the plot is rather different. An innocent doctor (now a vascular surgeon), Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) is on the run and is, at the same time, trying to locate the one-armed murderer of his wife, Helen Kimble (Sela Ward) before the authorities close in and execute him. In the movie's brief prologue, all available evidence had pointed to the doctor's guilt. The sentence was surprising and unusually swift. So, without any hope for deliverance, he finds himself handcuffed while riding in a prison bus to his hapless destiny. Directly because of a m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, the bus tumbles down an embankment directly onto train tracks. The massive collision of a freight train and the bus is as sensational as ever seen on screen. The locomotive may be derailed, but its momentum chases Kimble as he desperately runs for his life (No models: The train and bus were real!). Skillfully able to evade his pursuers, Dr. Kimble works his way back to Chicago where he resumes contacts with his friends and sympathizers. With few places to lick his wounds in a hostile winter and with no resources  and even slightly wounded  Kimble somehow defies the odds and stays free. See how he casually walks into a hospital, and, as a doctor knows exactly what to do: (1) self treat his wound, (2) grab a quick meal, (3) shave his beard, (4) clean up, (5) find suitable clothing, and (6) leave in an ambulance. Kimble's pursuit is led by Deputy US Marshal Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones). Gerard is obsessed with catching Kimble, and his manhunt is on a massive scale. Tommy Lee Jones as Gerard, whose screen presence is immense, is steadfast in his mission. He is alert, intelligent, and weather-beaten, and leaves no doubt who is in charge. He often adopts a superior tone. But, in the course of the film, as new facts are presented, Gerard's facial expressions and body language subtlety change as he comes to realize that the beleaguered surgeon may be innocent after all. Yet, he doggedly keeps up the chase, as he has a job to do, and not judge (Kimble: "I didn't kill my wife!" Gerard: "I don't care!"). He has a team that includes right-hand man Cosmo Renfro (Joe Pantoliano), Erin Poole (L. Scott Campbell), Noah Newman (Tom Wood), and Biggs (Daniel Roebuck). There are other characters, like Kelly and Rosetti of the Chicago Police Department; Kelly is especially adamant about Kimble's guilt right up to the very end. Meanwhile Kimble, using his brains as well as his wits, is eventually able to gain access to Cook County Hospital, where he searches for those who have prosthetic right arms. The doctor narrows the search to a manageable five names. He finds one man, a Frederick Sykes (Andreas Katsulas), an ex-policeman working in the security business. In the meantime Kimble finds a place to stay in a Polish woman's basement apartment. He is betrayed by her drug-dealing son but escapes. Back in the hospital, Kimble is instrumental in saving a boy's life by a quick diagnosis and altering the regular hospital doctor's instructions. Kimble meticulously pieces the puzzle together and realizes that he, and not his wife, was the real target. Kimble breaks into sullied Sykes apartment for more information. Dr. Lentz, deceased (actually murdered) the previous year, and Kimble's supposed friend Dr. Charles Nichols (Jeroen Krabbe) falsified the records/research of the dangers of a new drug (RDU 90 = Provasic) that caused liver damage to line their pockets. Knowing that Kimble would be against them, they hired Sykes to do their dirty work. There is an altercation on the Chicago El with Kimble and Sykes. Kimble then heads for the Grand Ballroom where an honorary dinner is being held for Dr. Nichols, who is touting the dangerous new drug as a miracle. The final confrontation occurs on a rooftop and in a laundry room. The movie, focusing on two determined, smart, and hardy men pitted against each other, builds suspense and excitement with plausible situations (except for the dam leap, the origins of which may be Alfred Hitchcocks' 1942 feature, "Saboteur"). The chase is stronger than the murder plot, which can be confusing. But the performances are very good, and Harrison Ford certainly appears in his element although Tommy Lee Jones won the coveted Oscar. Although Sela Ward's character died early, flashbacks enhance her screen time. Great cinematography and on-location shooting are always a plus. A final word: Unlike many modern movies, the language is not vulgar. "The Fugitive" is enjoyable even after many viewings.

    Harry Ford, looking like.... well, Harry Ford (same haircut, same stupid look on his face), is accused by the cops - against all sensibility on their part - of killing his wife for her fortune, even though Ford's 'Dr. Richard Kimble' is wealthy in his own right. Over two solid hours of cat and mouse plays out between Ford and marshal Tom Lee Jones: FORD: "I didn't kill my wife!" JONES: "Yeah, you did. There he goes! Get him! Whoops! He got away!" AUDIENCE: "Yawnnnn.... zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz". Joe Pantoliano sports his worst toupee as Jones' moronic sidekick while Ron Dean tags along for laughs as one of several pig-headed cops who are sure they've got their man in Ford amidst all the circumstantial evidence. Long, boring, movie with no relief from all the running, ducking, dodging, and those highly intense scenes where Ford is searching for information on computer screens. Yeah, work that keyboard, Harry. Oh no, you pressed the wrong key! Better backspace fast! How Ford ever got a career in the movies should be listed in the Guiness World Book of Records under the category "Luckiest Motherfu***rs of All-Time".

    Harrison Ford is a brilliant actor end of story. You gotta love his performance in this film and im not gonna lie here but the 80s and 90s were the best films of all compare to now(except some of them that are brilliant like Shrek,Tangled etc). The Fugitive is based off a TV series of the same name and tells the story of a Doctor Kimple(played by Harrison Ford) who's wife got murdered by a one hand guy who lost his hand in an accident and wears a prosthetic hand.But none of the cops believe him when he is up in court as they thrown him in jail as they think HIS the one that murdered his own wife. But when the train that brings him to jail breaks down,Richard(sporting long grey hair and a bushy grey beard)goes on the run and changes his appearance(by dying and chopping his hair) as well as shaving off his beard in order for the police not to notice him and to prove that he is an innocent man. So when one of the FBI agents tracks him down(played by Tommy Lee Jones),Richard proves to him that he is telling the truth about the man with the prosthetic hand,but will Lee Jones' charcther believe his story and let Richard get away?? Bottom Line this movie was brilliant. You gotta love the story,you gotta love the acting and everything about this film is fantastic. I know I know its not aimed towards women like me,and I don't wanna sound racist when saying it but I for one would highly put this film in at no 20 on my list of all time favourite movies. Is it my all time favourite movie No but is it a great film YES. Also keep an eye out for Jane Lynch(a very young looking Lynch)from Glee and Julianne Moore.

    The Fugitive has its plot pulled out of an 80s TV show with credible success. I don't know if the fans of the original series liked it, but I did. The good. Captivating story. Well built scenario and characters resulting in a nice intrigue. Gripping pace that won't let you down and give you only a few pauses. Solid action and acting. The actors. Commendable work by Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones. The bad. Lee Jones' character and actions as well as his whole work structure are a bit over the top. The ugly. Nothing. The result. If you like intrigue, Ford, Lee Jones, or a story about a guy trying to clear his name, it's definitely for you. If you like action, you'll also find your entertainment. There's even a bit of romance and a cap on the violence so the ladies might find their own too.

    Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones do what they do best in this heart stopping man hunt. They give you their clich&eacute;d gawks, studied replies and cowboy humor. And we love 'em for it. We also have a murder investigation, accompanied by the flashbacks of convicted Dr. Kimbel while on the run. The supplemental plot surrounding a wonder drug drives the finale a bit more than necessary as Hollywood goes straight to the obligatory good versus evil fisticuffs. Up until then, the action scenes trump each other and are always held up by the drama. What man wouldn't be obsessed with finding the truth when having Sela ward taken from you in her prime? While the one-armed bandit stays true to the TV storyline, our doctor saving a little boys' life seemed a bit over the top, but this blockbuster film still holds up over time.

    The film starts directly with the story without going into establishing much in the starting. The story starts with Harrison ford being accused of his wife's murder. Now after seeing so many movies, it is inevitable for me to think, where the plot will eventually go. But the story is simple without paying much emphasis on twists. The man is falsely accused and runs away owing to unusual circumstances and then starts to work in order to prove his innocence. There is pretty much just the running away from the police in the entire film. The plot is simple and what makes the movie worth watching are its fascinating screenplay and the power to grab your heart. The casting is one of the best. It could not have been better. From the starting itself the undoubted innocence on the face of Harrison ford as Dr. kimbley is the clue for everyone that he is falsely accused. This is the entire film. I cannot spoil the movie further because there is nothing much in the plot. Tommy lee Jones on the other hand again looks so sympathizing as the police officer that I knew from the beginning that he is going to help in the end. The movie is the best example of how a very simple plot can be so exciting. I was bound to think whether there can be a formula to make successful films. However, at times I got irritated at how he is able to escape always just from under the nose but then the innocent look on his face doesn't allow to go deeper into that. The film is very much normal and one of the best at the same times. MESSAGE: "Everyone gets a chance." VERDICT: "A recommended watch."

    Before watching this film I read that it was based on a 1960s TV series, that much of the dialogue was improvised, and that the script was still being written as filming started. That didn't bode well because, as we know, actors are interminably capable of speech, but dialogue is something different. However, maybe this is the exception to the rule, as Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones are both brilliant in their roles and if much of that was improvised, all credit to them. Jones got the Oscar for his role as by Lt. Gerard but Ford is equally impressive as the wronged Dr Richard Kimble, falsely accused of the murder of his wife (Sela Ward). We see her mostly in flashback and this is a believable relationship, unlike in the sequel using Wesley Snipes in the Ford role. The film is a cat and mouse chase as Gerard pursues Kimble through various settings. The sense of tension, perfectly backed by the music of James Newton Howard, builds like in a Hitchcock movie, which is a credit to director Andrew Davis. Michael Chapman's cinematography is crisp and sharp and clinical. Perfect for this film. As Kimble is being hunted by Gerard, he is himself hunting for the mysterious one-armed man who was the real murderer of his wife, but what was the motive? Using his medical knowledge and his analytical skill he aims to find his quarry before Gerard finds him! But Gerard is also piecing the truth together. Simple plot that twists and turns as it develops. In a sense you find yourself rooting for both men as they both come across as warm and intelligent, pursing their intertwined goals. I really can't find fault here. This is one of the top films ever. Why the IMDb rating is so low, I don't know. I'll do what I can to move it up a bit.

    Seeing the Nick Love big screen version of THE SWEENEY I was struck as to how cynical the marketing was . It could be any high octane thriller set around a bunch of bank robbers in London with a crime squad led by a rough diamond cop trying to bring the crooks to book . In other words it's simply called THE SWEENEY because it's got a ready made market for people who fondly remember the original TV show . This is pre-dated by this big screen version of the television show of THE FUGITIVE which features Harrison Ford playing a character called Dr Richard Kimble being pursued by a cop called Gerard in a film that is nothing more than a cynical exercise in trying to cash in on a half remembered TV show from yesteryear . That is not to say it's a bad film as such but anyone expecting anything along the lines of the TV original won't recognise this film as sharing anything in common with the David Janssen series As it stands if you like loud , brash , action packed muliplex entertainment then you'll certainly enjoy this movie . The downside is that you have to take the rough with the smooth and this comes in the form of plot contrivance . Interestingly the original court case is skated over and the audience never given a reason why Kimble is found guilty of the murder of his wife . Of course sharing the name of the TV series THE FUGITIVE and a character played by Harrison Ford in 1993 the audience know Kimble must be innocent but even so the evidence must have been rather damning . Being a contrived plot means that in order for the story to progress more and more ludicrous things involving good luck/bad luck has to happen which strains credibility when you stop to think about anything . The shark is well and truly jumped relatively early in the film where Kimble takes a dive of a dam falling several hundred feet in to a waterfall which must contain several thousand tons of water and surviving This sequence ties in with the protagonist's nemesis US Marshall Samuel Gerard who has the almostsupernatural ability to be one step ahead of the other characters . Kimble disappears in a blocked off tunnel ? He's obviously escaped down a drain . He jumps off the top of a dam ? He's obviously survived the fall . He looks through some garbage and concludes Kimble is using a false ID One almost hopes Gerard does something credible such as throw his hands up and say " Hey guys the trail has gone cold " but I guess that would mean less tension and excitement in a film that merely exists to wretch up tension and excitement to a multiplex audience . A fact reflected in its massive box office takings

But when the train that brings him to jail breaks down,Richard(sporting long grey hair and a bushy grey beard)goes on the run and changes his appearance(by dying and chopping his hair) as well as shaving off his beard in order for the police not to notice him and to prove that he is an innocent man. So when one of the FBI agents tracks him down(played by Tommy Lee Jones),Richard proves to him that he is telling the truth about the man with the prosthetic hand,but will Lee Jones' charcther believe his story and let Richard get away?? Bottom Line this movie was brilliant. You gotta love the story,you gotta love the acting and everything about this film is fantastic. I know I know its not aimed towards women like me,and I don't wanna sound racist when saying it but I for one would highly put this film in at no 20 on my list of all time favourite movies. Is it my all time favourite movie No but is it a great film YES. Also keep an eye out for Jane Lynch(a very young looking Lynch)from Glee and Julianne Moore.

    The Fugitive has its plot pulled out of an 80s TV show with credible success. I don't know if the fans of the original series liked it, but I did. The good. Captivating story. Well built scenario and characters resulting in a nice intrigue. Gripping pace that won't let you down and give you only a few pauses. Solid action and acting. The actors. Commendable work by Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones. The bad. Lee Jones' character and actions as well as his whole work structure are a bit over the top. The ugly. Nothing. The result. If you like intrigue, Ford, Lee Jones, or a story about a guy trying to clear his name, it's definitely for you. If you like action, you'll also find your entertainment. There's even a bit of romance and a cap on the violence so the ladies might find their own too.

    Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones do what they do best in this heart stopping man hunt. They give you their clich&eacute;d gawks, studied replies and cowboy humor. And we love 'em for it. We also have a murder investigation, accompanied by the flashbacks of convicted Dr. Kimbel while on the run. The supplemental plot surrounding a wonder drug drives the finale a bit more than necessary as Hollywood goes straight to the obligatory good versus evil fisticuffs. Up until then, the action scenes trump each other and are always held up by the drama. What man wouldn't be obsessed with finding the truth when having Sela ward taken from you in her prime? While the one-armed bandit stays true to the TV storyline, our doctor saving a little boys' life seemed a bit over the top, but this blockbuster film still holds up over time.

    The film starts directly with the story without going into establishing much in the starting. The story starts with Harrison ford being accused of his wife's murder. Now after seeing so many movies, it is inevitable for me to think, where the plot will eventually go. But the story is simple without paying much emphasis on twists. The man is falsely accused and runs away owing to unusual circumstances and then starts to work in order to prove his innocence. There is pretty much just the running away from the police in the entire film. The plot is simple and what makes the movie worth watching are its fascinating screenplay and the power to grab your heart. The casting is one of the best. It could not have been better. From the starting itself the undoubted innocence on the face of Harrison ford as Dr. kimbley is the clue for everyone that he is falsely accused. This is the entire film. I cannot spoil the movie further because there is nothing much in the plot. Tommy lee Jones on the other hand again looks so sympathizing as the police officer that I knew from the beginning that he is going to help in the end. The movie is the best example of how a very simple plot can be so exciting. I was bound to think whether there can be a formula to make successful films. However, at times I got irritated at how he is able to escape always just from under the nose but then the innocent look on his face doesn't allow to go deeper into that. The film is very much normal and one of the best at the same times. MESSAGE: "Everyone gets a chance." VERDICT: "A recommended watch."

    Before watching this film I read that it was based on a 1960s TV series, that much of the dialogue was improvised, and that the script was still being written as filming started. That didn't bode well because, as we know, actors are interminably capable of speech, but dialogue is something different. However, maybe this is the exception to the rule, as Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones are both brilliant in their roles and if much of that was improvised, all credit to them. Jones got the Oscar for his role as by Lt. Gerard but Ford is equally impressive as the wronged Dr Richard Kimble, falsely accused of the murder of his wife (Sela Ward). We see her mostly in flashback and this is a believable relationship, unlike in the sequel using Wesley Snipes in the Ford role. The film is a cat and mouse chase as Gerard pursues Kimble through various settings. The sense of tension, perfectly backed by the music of James Newton Howard, builds like in a Hitchcock movie, which is a credit to director Andrew Davis. Michael Chapman's cinematography is crisp and sharp and clinical. Perfect for this film. As Kimble is being hunted by Gerard, he is himself hunting for the mysterious one-armed man who was the real murderer of his wife, but what was the motive? Using his medical knowledge and his analytical skill he aims to find his quarry before Gerard finds him! But Gerard is also piecing the truth together. Simple plot that twists and turns as it develops. In a sense you find yourself rooting for both men as they both come across as warm and intelligent, pursing their intertwined goals. I really can't find fault here. This is one of the top films ever. Why the IMDb rating is so low, I don't know. I'll do what I can to move it up a bit.

    Seeing the Nick Love big screen version of THE SWEENEY I was struck as to how cynical the marketing was . It could be any high octane thriller set around a bunch of bank robbers in London with a crime squad led by a rough diamond cop trying to bring the crooks to book . In other words it's simply called THE SWEENEY because it's got a ready made market for people who fondly remember the original TV show . This is pre-dated by this big screen version of the television show of THE FUGITIVE which features Harrison Ford playing a character called Dr Richard Kimble being pursued by a cop called Gerard in a film that is nothing more than a cynical exercise in trying to cash in on a half remembered TV show from yesteryear . That is not to say it's a bad film as such but anyone expecting anything along the lines of the TV original won't recognise this film as sharing anything in common with the David Janssen series As it stands if you like loud , brash , action packed muliplex entertainment then you'll certainly enjoy this movie . The downside is that you have to take the rough with the smooth and this comes in the form of plot contrivance . Interestingly the original court case is skated over and the audience never given a reason why Kimble is found guilty of the murder of his wife . Of course sharing the name of the TV series THE FUGITIVE and a character played by Harrison Ford in 1993 the audience know Kimble must be innocent but even so the evidence must have been rather damning . Being a contrived plot means that in order for the story to progress more and more ludicrous things involving good luck/bad luck has to happen which strains credibility when you stop to think about anything . The shark is well and truly jumped relatively early in the film where Kimble takes a dive of a dam falling several hundred feet in to a waterfall which must contain several thousand tons of water and surviving This sequence ties in with the protagonist's nemesis US Marshall Samuel Gerard who has the almostsupernatural ability to be one step ahead of the other characters . Kimble disappears in a blocked off tunnel ? He's obviously escaped down a drain . He jumps off the top of a dam ? He's obviously survived the fall . He looks through some garbage and concludes Kimble is using a false ID One almost hopes Gerard does something credible such as throw his hands up and say " Hey guys the trail has gone cold " but I guess that would mean less tension and excitement in a film that merely exists to wretch up tension and excitement to a multiplex audience . A fact reflected in its massive box office takings

    In the popular TV series of the same name (1963-1967), David Janssen played the lead role of a doctor who had been tried, convicted, and sentenced to die for the murder of his wife. The doctor, Richard Kimble, was innocent of the crime. Because of a train wreck, Kimble was able to escape and subsequently search for the one-armed man that he knew was the real culprit. Folks tuned in every week to see how the doctor fared. Despite many close calls and being fanatically pursued by a relentless Lt. Gerard, Kimble remained elusive. Finally, after four years, Kimble and his quarry were trapped atop a water tower in the presence of Gerard, who shot the one-armed murderer from the ground. That final episode on a Tuesday in August of 1967 garnered a 72 percent share of all USA TV viewers. The 1993 movie of the same name maintains the same premise although the plot is rather different. An innocent doctor (now a vascular surgeon), Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) is on the run and is, at the same time, trying to locate the one-armed murderer of his wife, Helen Kimble (Sela Ward) before the authorities close in and execute him. In the movie's brief prologue, all available evidence had pointed to the doctor's guilt. The sentence was surprising and unusually swift. So, without any hope for deliverance, he finds himself handcuffed while riding in a prison bus to his hapless destiny. Directly because of a m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, the bus tumbles down an embankment directly onto train tracks. The massive collision of a freight train and the bus is as sensational as ever seen on screen. The locomotive may be derailed, but its momentum chases Kimble as he desperately runs for his life (No models: The train and bus were real!). Skillfully able to evade his pursuers, Dr. Kimble works his way back to Chicago where he resumes contacts with his friends and sympathizers. With few places to lick his wounds in a hostile winter and with no resources  and even slightly wounded  Kimble somehow defies the odds and stays free. See how he casually walks into a hospital, and, as a doctor knows exactly what to do: (1) self treat his wound, (2) grab a quick meal, (3) shave his beard, (4) clean up, (5) find suitable clothing, and (6) leave in an ambulance. Kimble's pursuit is led by Deputy US Marshal Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones). Gerard is obsessed with catching Kimble, and his manhunt is on a massive scale. Tommy Lee Jones as Gerard, whose screen presence is immense, is steadfast in his mission. He is alert, intelligent, and weather-beaten, and leaves no doubt who is in charge. He often adopts a superior tone. But, in the course of the film, as new facts are presented, Gerard's facial expressions and body language subtlety change as he comes to realize that the beleaguered surgeon may be innocent after all. Yet, he doggedly keeps up the chase, as he has a job to do, and not judge (Kimble: "I didn't kill my wife!" Gerard: "I don't care!"). He has a team that includes right-hand man Cosmo Renfro (Joe Pantoliano), Erin Poole (L. Scott Campbell), Noah Newman (Tom Wood), and Biggs (Daniel Roebuck). There are other characters, like Kelly and Rosetti of the Chicago Police Department; Kelly is especially adamant about Kimble's guilt right up to the very end. Meanwhile Kimble, using his brains as well as his wits, is eventually able to gain access to Cook County Hospital, where he searches for those who have prosthetic right arms. The doctor narrows the search to a manageable five names. He finds one man, a Frederick Sykes (Andreas Katsulas), an ex-policeman working in the security business. In the meantime Kimble finds a place to stay in a Polish woman's basement apartment. He is betrayed by her drug-dealing son but escapes. Back in the hospital, Kimble is instrumental in saving a boy's life by a quick diagnosis and altering the regular hospital doctor's instructions. Kimble meticulously pieces the puzzle together and realizes that he, and not his wife, was the real target. Kimble breaks into sullied Sykes apartment for more information. Dr. Lentz, deceased (actually murdered) the previous year, and Kimble's supposed friend Dr. Charles Nichols (Jeroen Krabbe) falsified the records/research of the dangers of a new drug (RDU 90 = Provasic) that caused liver damage to line their pockets. Knowing that Kimble would be against them, they hired Sykes to do their dirty work. There is an altercation on the Chicago El with Kimble and Sykes. Kimble then heads for the Grand Ballroom where an honorary dinner is being held for Dr. Nichols, who is touting the dangerous new drug as a miracle. The final confrontation occurs on a rooftop and in a laundry room. The movie, focusing on two determined, smart, and hardy men pitted against each other, builds suspense and excitement with plausible situations (except for the dam leap, the origins of which may be Alfred Hitchcocks' 1942 feature, "Saboteur"). The chase is stronger than the murder plot, which can be confusing. But the performances are very good, and Harrison Ford certainly appears in his element although Tommy Lee Jones won the coveted Oscar. Although Sela Ward's character died early, flashbacks enhance her screen time. Great cinematography and on-location shooting are always a plus. A final word: Unlike many modern movies, the language is not vulgar. "The Fugitive" is enjoyable even after many viewings.

    Harry Ford, looking like.... well, Harry Ford (same haircut, same stupid look on his face), is accused by the cops - against all sensibility on their part - of killing his wife for her fortune, even though Ford's 'Dr. Richard Kimble' is wealthy in his own right. Over two solid hours of cat and mouse plays out between Ford and marshal Tom Lee Jones: FORD: "I didn't kill my wife!" JONES: "Yeah, you did. There he goes! Get him! Whoops! He got away!" AUDIENCE: "Yawnnnn.... zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz". Joe Pantoliano sports his worst toupee as Jones' moronic sidekick while Ron Dean tags along for laughs as one of several pig-headed cops who are sure they've got their man in Ford amidst all the circumstantial evidence. Long, boring, movie with no relief from all the running, ducking, dodging, and those highly intense scenes where Ford is searching for information on computer screens. Yeah, work that keyboard, Harry. Oh no, you pressed the wrong key! Better backspace fast! How Ford ever got a career in the movies should be listed in the Guiness World Book of Records under the category "Luckiest Motherfu***rs of All-Time".

    if this isn't the best ever adaptation from a TV series to a movie I don't know what is.. please tell me because I would like to know what would top this one.. the story of the one armed man is back finally 30 years in the making , I remember bits and pieces from the old TV show which I intend to find somewhere and own one day, because I never finished seeing the whole season,, so you have a shortened version here, Tommy Lee Jones,, vs. Harrison Ford,, plain and simple,, our Marshall and his crackpot team must figure out a way to catch the very elusive and dapper, Dr. Richard Kimble ,, who we all know did not kill his wife,, but with all the mounting evidence,, and the good Dr's total lack of his whereabouts, it's really kind of hard to believe him.. on his way to prison, the train flips over, and presto , the Dr. is now on the run,, I personally love the dam jump scene,, and the part where the Marshall says he just doesn't give a damn. what a wonderful action movie,, lot's of suspense great plot,, scenery acting,, a perfect movie with the perfect actors of that time period playing those parts.

    In the popular TV series of the same name (1963-1967), David Janssen played the lead role of a doctor who had been tried, convicted, and sentenced to die for the murder of his wife. The doctor, Richard Kimble, was innocent of the crime. Because of a train wreck, Kimble was able to escape and subsequently search for the one-armed man that he knew was the real culprit. Folks tuned in every week to see how the doctor fared. Despite many close calls and being fanatically pursued by a relentless Lt. Gerard, Kimble remained elusive. Finally, after four years, Kimble and his quarry were trapped atop a water tower in the presence of Gerard, who shot the one-armed murderer from the ground. That final episode on a Tuesday in August of 1967 garnered a 72 percent share of all USA TV viewers. The 1993 movie of the same name maintains the same premise although the plot is rather different. An innocent doctor (now a vascular surgeon), Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) is on the run and is, at the same time, trying to locate the one-armed murderer of his wife, Helen Kimble (Sela Ward) before the authorities close in and execute him. In the movie's brief prologue, all available evidence had pointed to the doctor's guilt. The sentence was surprising and unusually swift. So, without any hope for deliverance, he finds himself handcuffed while riding in a prison bus to his hapless destiny. Directly because of a m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, the bus tumbles down an embankment directly onto train tracks. The massive collision of a freight train and the bus is as sensational as ever seen on screen. The locomotive may be derailed, but its momentum chases Kimble as he desperately runs for his life (No models: The train and bus were real!). Skillfully able to evade his pursuers, Dr. Kimble works his way back to Chicago where he resumes contacts with his friends and sympathizers. With few places to lick his wounds in a hostile winter and with no resources  and even slightly wounded  Kimble somehow defies the odds and stays free. See how he casually walks into a hospital, and, as a doctor knows exactly what to do: (1) self treat his wound, (2) grab a quick meal, (3) shave his beard, (4) clean up, (5) find suitable clothing, and (6) leave in an ambulance. Kimble's pursuit is led by Deputy US Marshal Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones). Gerard is obsessed with catching Kimble, and his manhunt is on a massive scale. Tommy Lee Jones as Gerard, whose screen presence is immense, is steadfast in his mission. He is alert, intelligent, and weather-beaten, and leaves no doubt who is in charge. He often adopts a superior tone. But, in the course of the film, as new facts are presented, Gerard's facial expressions and body language subtlety change as he comes to realize that the beleaguered surgeon may be innocent after all. Yet, he doggedly keeps up the chase, as he has a job to do, and not judge (Kimble: "I didn't kill my wife!" Gerard: "I don't care!"). He has a team that includes right-hand man Cosmo Renfro (Joe Pantoliano), Erin Poole (L. Scott Campbell), Noah Newman (Tom Wood), and Biggs (Daniel Roebuck). There are other characters, like Kelly and Rosetti of the Chicago Police Department; Kelly is especially adamant about Kimble's guilt right up to the very end. Meanwhile Kimble, using his brains as well as his wits, is eventually able to gain access to Cook County Hospital, where he searches for those who have prosthetic right arms. The doctor narrows the search to a manageable five names. He finds one man, a Frederick Sykes (Andreas Katsulas), an ex-policeman working in the security business. In the meantime Kimble finds a place to stay in a Polish woman's basement apartment. He is betrayed by her drug-dealing son but escapes. Back in the hospital, Kimble is instrumental in saving a boy's life by a quick diagnosis and altering the regular hospital doctor's instructions. Kimble meticulously pieces the puzzle together and realizes that he, and not his wife, was the real target. Kimble breaks into sullied Sykes apartment for more information. Dr. Lentz, deceased (actually murdered) the previous year, and Kimble's supposed friend Dr. Charles Nichols (Jeroen Krabbe) falsified the records/research of the dangers of a new drug (RDU 90 = Provasic) that caused liver damage to line their pockets. Knowing that Kimble would be against them, they hired Sykes to do their dirty work. There is an altercation on the Chicago El with Kimble and Sykes. Kimble then heads for the Grand Ballroom where an honorary dinner is being held for Dr. Nichols, who is touting the dangerous new drug as a miracle. The final confrontation occurs on a rooftop and in a laundry room. The movie, focusing on two determined, smart, and hardy men pitted against each other, builds suspense and excitement with plausible situations (except for the dam leap, the origins of which may be Alfred Hitchcocks' 1942 feature, "Saboteur"). The chase is stronger than the murder plot, which can be confusing. But the performances are very good, and Harrison Ford certainly appears in his element although Tommy Lee Jones won the coveted Oscar. Although Sela Ward's character died early, flashbacks enhance her screen time. Great cinematography and on-location shooting are always a plus. A final word: Unlike many modern movies, the language is not vulgar. "The Fugitive" is enjoyable even after many viewings.

    Harry Ford, looking like.... well, Harry Ford (same haircut, same stupid look on his face), is accused by the cops - against all sensibility on their part - of killing his wife for her fortune, even though Ford's 'Dr. Richard Kimble' is wealthy in his own right. Over two solid hours of cat and mouse plays out between Ford and marshal Tom Lee Jones: FORD: "I didn't kill my wife!" JONES: "Yeah, you did. There he goes! Get him! Whoops! He got away!" AUDIENCE: "Yawnnnn.... zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz". Joe Pantoliano sports his worst toupee as Jones' moronic sidekick while Ron Dean tags along for laughs as one of several pig-headed cops who are sure they've got their man in Ford amidst all the circumstantial evidence. Long, boring, movie with no relief from all the running, ducking, dodging, and those highly intense scenes where Ford is searching for information on computer screens. Yeah, work that keyboard, Harry. Oh no, you pressed the wrong key! Better backspace fast! How Ford ever got a career in the movies should be listed in the Guiness World Book of Records under the category "Luckiest Motherfu***rs of All-Time".

    Harrison Ford is a brilliant actor end of story. You gotta love his performance in this film and im not gonna lie here but the 80s and 90s were the best films of all compare to now(except some of them that are brilliant like Shrek,Tangled etc). The Fugitive is based off a TV series of the same name and tells the story of a Doctor Kimple(played by Harrison Ford) who's wife got murdered by a one hand guy who lost his hand in an accident and wears a prosthetic hand.But none of the cops believe him when he is up in court as they thrown him in jail as they think HIS the one that murdered his own wife. But when the train that brings him to jail breaks down,Richard(sporting long grey hair and a bushy grey beard)goes on the run and changes his appearance(by dying and chopping his hair) as well as shaving off his beard in order for the police not to notice him and to prove that he is an innocent man. So when one of the FBI agents tracks him down(played by Tommy Lee Jones),Richard proves to him that he is telling the truth about the man with the prosthetic hand,but will Lee Jones' charcther believe his story and let Richard get away?? Bottom Line this movie was brilliant. You gotta love the story,you gotta love the acting and everything about this film is fantastic. I know I know its not aimed towards women like me,and I don't wanna sound racist when saying it but I for one would highly put this film in at no 20 on my list of all time favourite movies. Is it my all time favourite movie No but is it a great film YES. Also keep an eye out for Jane Lynch(a very young looking Lynch)from Glee and Julianne Moore.

    The Fugitive has its plot pulled out of an 80s TV show with credible success. I don't know if the fans of the original series liked it, but I did. The good. Captivating story. Well built scenario and characters resulting in a nice intrigue. Gripping pace that won't let you down and give you only a few pauses. Solid action and acting. The actors. Commendable work by Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones. The bad. Lee Jones' character and actions as well as his whole work structure are a bit over the top. The ugly. Nothing. The result. If you like intrigue, Ford, Lee Jones, or a story about a guy trying to clear his name, it's definitely for you. If you like action, you'll also find your entertainment. There's even a bit of romance and a cap on the violence so the ladies might find their own too.

    Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones do what they do best in this heart stopping man hunt. They give you their clich&eacute;d gawks, studied replies and cowboy humor. And we love 'em for it. We also have a murder investigation, accompanied by the flashbacks of convicted Dr. Kimbel while on the run. The supplemental plot surrounding a wonder drug drives the finale a bit more than necessary as Hollywood goes straight to the obligatory good versus evil fisticuffs. Up until then, the action scenes trump each other and are always held up by the drama. What man wouldn't be obsessed with finding the truth when having Sela ward taken from you in her prime? While the one-armed bandit stays true to the TV storyline, our doctor saving a little boys' life seemed a bit over the top, but this blockbuster film still holds up over time.

    The film starts directly with the story without going into establishing much in the starting. The story starts with Harrison ford being accused of his wife's murder. Now after seeing so many movies, it is inevitable for me to think, where the plot will eventually go. But the story is simple without paying much emphasis on twists. The man is falsely accused and runs away owing to unusual circumstances and then starts to work in order to prove his innocence. There is pretty much just the running away from the police in the entire film. The plot is simple and what makes the movie worth watching are its fascinating screenplay and the power to grab your heart. The casting is one of the best. It could not have been better. From the starting itself the undoubted innocence on the face of Harrison ford as Dr. kimbley is the clue for everyone that he is falsely accused. This is the entire film. I cannot spoil the movie further because there is nothing much in the plot. Tommy lee Jones on the other hand again looks so sympathizing as the police officer that I knew from the beginning that he is going to help in the end. The movie is the best example of how a very simple plot can be so exciting. I was bound to think whether there can be a formula to make successful films. However, at times I got irritated at how he is able to escape always just from under the nose but then the innocent look on his face doesn't allow to go deeper into that. The film is very much normal and one of the best at the same times. MESSAGE: "Everyone gets a chance." VERDICT: "A recommended watch."

    Before watching this film I read that it was based on a 1960s TV series, that much of the dialogue was improvised, and that the script was still being written as filming started. That didn't bode well because, as we know, actors are interminably capable of speech, but dialogue is something different. However, maybe this is the exception to the rule, as Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones are both brilliant in their roles and if much of that was improvised, all credit to them. Jones got the Oscar for his role as by Lt. Gerard but Ford is equally impressive as the wronged Dr Richard Kimble, falsely accused of the murder of his wife (Sela Ward). We see her mostly in flashback and this is a believable relationship, unlike in the sequel using Wesley Snipes in the Ford role. The film is a cat and mouse chase as Gerard pursues Kimble through various settings. The sense of tension, perfectly backed by the music of James Newton Howard, builds like in a Hitchcock movie, which is a credit to director Andrew Davis. Michael Chapman's cinematography is crisp and sharp and clinical. Perfect for this film. As Kimble is being hunted by Gerard, he is himself hunting for the mysterious one-armed man who was the real murderer of his wife, but what was the motive? Using his medical knowledge and his analytical skill he aims to find his quarry before Gerard finds him! But Gerard is also piecing the truth together. Simple plot that twists and turns as it develops. In a sense you find yourself rooting for both men as they both come across as warm and intelligent, pursing their intertwined goals. I really can't find fault here. This is one of the top films ever. Why the IMDb rating is so low, I don't know. I'll do what I can to move it up a bit.

    Seeing the Nick Love big screen version of THE SWEENEY I was struck as to how cynical the marketing was . It could be any high octane thriller set around a bunch of bank robbers in London with a crime squad led by a rough diamond cop trying to bring the crooks to book . In other words it's simply called THE SWEENEY because it's got a ready made market for people who fondly remember the original TV show . This is pre-dated by this big screen version of the television show of THE FUGITIVE which features Harrison Ford playing a character called Dr Richard Kimble being pursued by a cop called Gerard in a film that is nothing more than a cynical exercise in trying to cash in on a half remembered TV show from yesteryear . That is not to say it's a bad film as such but anyone expecting anything along the lines of the TV original won't recognise this film as sharing anything in common with the David Janssen series As it stands if you like loud , brash , action packed muliplex entertainment then you'll certainly enjoy this movie . The downside is that you have to take the rough with the smooth and this comes in the form of plot contrivance . Interestingly the original court case is skated over and the audience never given a reason why Kimble is found guilty of the murder of his wife . Of course sharing the name of the TV series THE FUGITIVE and a character played by Harrison Ford in 1993 the audience know Kimble must be innocent but even so the evidence must have been rather damning . Being a contrived plot means that in order for the story to progress more and more ludicrous things involving good luck/bad luck has to happen which strains credibility when you stop to think about anything . The shark is well and truly jumped relatively early in the film where Kimble takes a dive of a dam falling several hundred feet in to a waterfall which must contain several thousand tons of water and surviving This sequence ties in with the protagonist's nemesis US Marshall Samuel Gerard who has the almostsupernatural ability to be one step ahead of the other characters . Kimble disappears in a blocked off tunnel ? He's obviously escaped down a drain . He jumps off the top of a dam ? He's obviously survived the fall . He looks through some garbage and concludes Kimble is using a false ID One almost hopes Gerard does something credible such as throw his hands up and say " Hey guys the trail has gone cold " but I guess that would mean less tension and excitement in a film that merely exists to wretch up tension and excitement to a multiplex audience . A fact reflected in its massive box office takings

The supplemental plot surrounding a wonder drug drives the finale a bit more than necessary as Hollywood goes straight to the obligatory good versus evil fisticuffs. Up until then, the action scenes trump each other and are always held up by the drama. What man wouldn't be obsessed with finding the truth when having Sela ward taken from you in her prime? While the one-armed bandit stays true to the TV storyline, our doctor saving a little boys' life seemed a bit over the top, but this blockbuster film still holds up over time.

    The film starts directly with the story without going into establishing much in the starting. The story starts with Harrison ford being accused of his wife's murder. Now after seeing so many movies, it is inevitable for me to think, where the plot will eventually go. But the story is simple without paying much emphasis on twists. The man is falsely accused and runs away owing to unusual circumstances and then starts to work in order to prove his innocence. There is pretty much just the running away from the police in the entire film. The plot is simple and what makes the movie worth watching are its fascinating screenplay and the power to grab your heart. The casting is one of the best. It could not have been better. From the starting itself the undoubted innocence on the face of Harrison ford as Dr. kimbley is the clue for everyone that he is falsely accused. This is the entire film. I cannot spoil the movie further because there is nothing much in the plot. Tommy lee Jones on the other hand again looks so sympathizing as the police officer that I knew from the beginning that he is going to help in the end. The movie is the best example of how a very simple plot can be so exciting. I was bound to think whether there can be a formula to make successful films. However, at times I got irritated at how he is able to escape always just from under the nose but then the innocent look on his face doesn't allow to go deeper into that. The film is very much normal and one of the best at the same times. MESSAGE: "Everyone gets a chance." VERDICT: "A recommended watch."

    Before watching this film I read that it was based on a 1960s TV series, that much of the dialogue was improvised, and that the script was still being written as filming started. That didn't bode well because, as we know, actors are interminably capable of speech, but dialogue is something different. However, maybe this is the exception to the rule, as Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones are both brilliant in their roles and if much of that was improvised, all credit to them. Jones got the Oscar for his role as by Lt. Gerard but Ford is equally impressive as the wronged Dr Richard Kimble, falsely accused of the murder of his wife (Sela Ward). We see her mostly in flashback and this is a believable relationship, unlike in the sequel using Wesley Snipes in the Ford role. The film is a cat and mouse chase as Gerard pursues Kimble through various settings. The sense of tension, perfectly backed by the music of James Newton Howard, builds like in a Hitchcock movie, which is a credit to director Andrew Davis. Michael Chapman's cinematography is crisp and sharp and clinical. Perfect for this film. As Kimble is being hunted by Gerard, he is himself hunting for the mysterious one-armed man who was the real murderer of his wife, but what was the motive? Using his medical knowledge and his analytical skill he aims to find his quarry before Gerard finds him! But Gerard is also piecing the truth together. Simple plot that twists and turns as it develops. In a sense you find yourself rooting for both men as they both come across as warm and intelligent, pursing their intertwined goals. I really can't find fault here. This is one of the top films ever. Why the IMDb rating is so low, I don't know. I'll do what I can to move it up a bit.

    Seeing the Nick Love big screen version of THE SWEENEY I was struck as to how cynical the marketing was . It could be any high octane thriller set around a bunch of bank robbers in London with a crime squad led by a rough diamond cop trying to bring the crooks to book . In other words it's simply called THE SWEENEY because it's got a ready made market for people who fondly remember the original TV show . This is pre-dated by this big screen version of the television show of THE FUGITIVE which features Harrison Ford playing a character called Dr Richard Kimble being pursued by a cop called Gerard in a film that is nothing more than a cynical exercise in trying to cash in on a half remembered TV show from yesteryear . That is not to say it's a bad film as such but anyone expecting anything along the lines of the TV original won't recognise this film as sharing anything in common with the David Janssen series As it stands if you like loud , brash , action packed muliplex entertainment then you'll certainly enjoy this movie . The downside is that you have to take the rough with the smooth and this comes in the form of plot contrivance . Interestingly the original court case is skated over and the audience never given a reason why Kimble is found guilty of the murder of his wife . Of course sharing the name of the TV series THE FUGITIVE and a character played by Harrison Ford in 1993 the audience know Kimble must be innocent but even so the evidence must have been rather damning . Being a contrived plot means that in order for the story to progress more and more ludicrous things involving good luck/bad luck has to happen which strains credibility when you stop to think about anything . The shark is well and truly jumped relatively early in the film where Kimble takes a dive of a dam falling several hundred feet in to a waterfall which must contain several thousand tons of water and surviving This sequence ties in with the protagonist's nemesis US Marshall Samuel Gerard who has the almostsupernatural ability to be one step ahead of the other characters . Kimble disappears in a blocked off tunnel ? He's obviously escaped down a drain . He jumps off the top of a dam ? He's obviously survived the fall . He looks through some garbage and concludes Kimble is using a false ID One almost hopes Gerard does something credible such as throw his hands up and say " Hey guys the trail has gone cold " but I guess that would mean less tension and excitement in a film that merely exists to wretch up tension and excitement to a multiplex audience . A fact reflected in its massive box office takings

    In the popular TV series of the same name (1963-1967), David Janssen played the lead role of a doctor who had been tried, convicted, and sentenced to die for the murder of his wife. The doctor, Richard Kimble, was innocent of the crime. Because of a train wreck, Kimble was able to escape and subsequently search for the one-armed man that he knew was the real culprit. Folks tuned in every week to see how the doctor fared. Despite many close calls and being fanatically pursued by a relentless Lt. Gerard, Kimble remained elusive. Finally, after four years, Kimble and his quarry were trapped atop a water tower in the presence of Gerard, who shot the one-armed murderer from the ground. That final episode on a Tuesday in August of 1967 garnered a 72 percent share of all USA TV viewers. The 1993 movie of the same name maintains the same premise although the plot is rather different. An innocent doctor (now a vascular surgeon), Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) is on the run and is, at the same time, trying to locate the one-armed murderer of his wife, Helen Kimble (Sela Ward) before the authorities close in and execute him. In the movie's brief prologue, all available evidence had pointed to the doctor's guilt. The sentence was surprising and unusually swift. So, without any hope for deliverance, he finds himself handcuffed while riding in a prison bus to his hapless destiny. Directly because of a m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, the bus tumbles down an embankment directly onto train tracks. The massive collision of a freight train and the bus is as sensational as ever seen on screen. The locomotive may be derailed, but its momentum chases Kimble as he desperately runs for his life (No models: The train and bus were real!). Skillfully able to evade his pursuers, Dr. Kimble works his way back to Chicago where he resumes contacts with his friends and sympathizers. With few places to lick his wounds in a hostile winter and with no resources  and even slightly wounded  Kimble somehow defies the odds and stays free. See how he casually walks into a hospital, and, as a doctor knows exactly what to do: (1) self treat his wound, (2) grab a quick meal, (3) shave his beard, (4) clean up, (5) find suitable clothing, and (6) leave in an ambulance. Kimble's pursuit is led by Deputy US Marshal Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones). Gerard is obsessed with catching Kimble, and his manhunt is on a massive scale. Tommy Lee Jones as Gerard, whose screen presence is immense, is steadfast in his mission. He is alert, intelligent, and weather-beaten, and leaves no doubt who is in charge. He often adopts a superior tone. But, in the course of the film, as new facts are presented, Gerard's facial expressions and body language subtlety change as he comes to realize that the beleaguered surgeon may be innocent after all. Yet, he doggedly keeps up the chase, as he has a job to do, and not judge (Kimble: "I didn't kill my wife!" Gerard: "I don't care!"). He has a team that includes right-hand man Cosmo Renfro (Joe Pantoliano), Erin Poole (L. Scott Campbell), Noah Newman (Tom Wood), and Biggs (Daniel Roebuck). There are other characters, like Kelly and Rosetti of the Chicago Police Department; Kelly is especially adamant about Kimble's guilt right up to the very end. Meanwhile Kimble, using his brains as well as his wits, is eventually able to gain access to Cook County Hospital, where he searches for those who have prosthetic right arms. The doctor narrows the search to a manageable five names. He finds one man, a Frederick Sykes (Andreas Katsulas), an ex-policeman working in the security business. In the meantime Kimble finds a place to stay in a Polish woman's basement apartment. He is betrayed by her drug-dealing son but escapes. Back in the hospital, Kimble is instrumental in saving a boy's life by a quick diagnosis and altering the regular hospital doctor's instructions. Kimble meticulously pieces the puzzle together and realizes that he, and not his wife, was the real target. Kimble breaks into sullied Sykes apartment for more information. Dr. Lentz, deceased (actually murdered) the previous year, and Kimble's supposed friend Dr. Charles Nichols (Jeroen Krabbe) falsified the records/research of the dangers of a new drug (RDU 90 = Provasic) that caused liver damage to line their pockets. Knowing that Kimble would be against them, they hired Sykes to do their dirty work. There is an altercation on the Chicago El with Kimble and Sykes. Kimble then heads for the Grand Ballroom where an honorary dinner is being held for Dr. Nichols, who is touting the dangerous new drug as a miracle. The final confrontation occurs on a rooftop and in a laundry room. The movie, focusing on two determined, smart, and hardy men pitted against each other, builds suspense and excitement with plausible situations (except for the dam leap, the origins of which may be Alfred Hitchcocks' 1942 feature, "Saboteur"). The chase is stronger than the murder plot, which can be confusing. But the performances are very good, and Harrison Ford certainly appears in his element although Tommy Lee Jones won the coveted Oscar. Although Sela Ward's character died early, flashbacks enhance her screen time. Great cinematography and on-location shooting are always a plus. A final word: Unlike many modern movies, the language is not vulgar. "The Fugitive" is enjoyable even after many viewings.

    Harry Ford, looking like.... well, Harry Ford (same haircut, same stupid look on his face), is accused by the cops - against all sensibility on their part - of killing his wife for her fortune, even though Ford's 'Dr. Richard Kimble' is wealthy in his own right. Over two solid hours of cat and mouse plays out between Ford and marshal Tom Lee Jones: FORD: "I didn't kill my wife!" JONES: "Yeah, you did. There he goes! Get him! Whoops! He got away!" AUDIENCE: "Yawnnnn.... zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz". Joe Pantoliano sports his worst toupee as Jones' moronic sidekick while Ron Dean tags along for laughs as one of several pig-headed cops who are sure they've got their man in Ford amidst all the circumstantial evidence. Long, boring, movie with no relief from all the running, ducking, dodging, and those highly intense scenes where Ford is searching for information on computer screens. Yeah, work that keyboard, Harry. Oh no, you pressed the wrong key! Better backspace fast! How Ford ever got a career in the movies should be listed in the Guiness World Book of Records under the category "Luckiest Motherfu***rs of All-Time".

    if this isn't the best ever adaptation from a TV series to a movie I don't know what is.. please tell me because I would like to know what would top this one.. the story of the one armed man is back finally 30 years in the making , I remember bits and pieces from the old TV show which I intend to find somewhere and own one day, because I never finished seeing the whole season,, so you have a shortened version here, Tommy Lee Jones,, vs. Harrison Ford,, plain and simple,, our Marshall and his crackpot team must figure out a way to catch the very elusive and dapper, Dr. Richard Kimble ,, who we all know did not kill his wife,, but with all the mounting evidence,, and the good Dr's total lack of his whereabouts, it's really kind of hard to believe him.. on his way to prison, the train flips over, and presto , the Dr. is now on the run,, I personally love the dam jump scene,, and the part where the Marshall says he just doesn't give a damn. what a wonderful action movie,, lot's of suspense great plot,, scenery acting,, a perfect movie with the perfect actors of that time period playing those parts.

    Harrison Ford is a brilliant actor end of story. You gotta love his performance in this film and im not gonna lie here but the 80s and 90s were the best films of all compare to now(except some of them that are brilliant like Shrek,Tangled etc). The Fugitive is based off a TV series of the same name and tells the story of a Doctor Kimple(played by Harrison Ford) who's wife got murdered by a one hand guy who lost his hand in an accident and wears a prosthetic hand.But none of the cops believe him when he is up in court as they thrown him in jail as they think HIS the one that murdered his own wife. But when the train that brings him to jail breaks down,Richard(sporting long grey hair and a bushy grey beard)goes on the run and changes his appearance(by dying and chopping his hair) as well as shaving off his beard in order for the police not to notice him and to prove that he is an innocent man. So when one of the FBI agents tracks him down(played by Tommy Lee Jones),Richard proves to him that he is telling the truth about the man with the prosthetic hand,but will Lee Jones' charcther believe his story and let Richard get away?? Bottom Line this movie was brilliant. You gotta love the story,you gotta love the acting and everything about this film is fantastic. I know I know its not aimed towards women like me,and I don't wanna sound racist when saying it but I for one would highly put this film in at no 20 on my list of all time favourite movies. Is it my all time favourite movie No but is it a great film YES. Also keep an eye out for Jane Lynch(a very young looking Lynch)from Glee and Julianne Moore.

    The Fugitive has its plot pulled out of an 80s TV show with credible success. I don't know if the fans of the original series liked it, but I did. The good. Captivating story. Well built scenario and characters resulting in a nice intrigue. Gripping pace that won't let you down and give you only a few pauses. Solid action and acting. The actors. Commendable work by Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones. The bad. Lee Jones' character and actions as well as his whole work structure are a bit over the top. The ugly. Nothing. The result. If you like intrigue, Ford, Lee Jones, or a story about a guy trying to clear his name, it's definitely for you. If you like action, you'll also find your entertainment. There's even a bit of romance and a cap on the violence so the ladies might find their own too.

Meanwhile Kimble, using his brains as well as his wits, is eventually able to gain access to Cook County Hospital, where he searches for those who have prosthetic right arms. The doctor narrows the search to a manageable five names. He finds one man, a Frederick Sykes (Andreas Katsulas), an ex-policeman working in the security business. In the meantime Kimble finds a place to stay in a Polish woman's basement apartment. He is betrayed by her drug-dealing son but escapes. Back in the hospital, Kimble is instrumental in saving a boy's life by a quick diagnosis and altering the regular hospital doctor's instructions. Kimble meticulously pieces the puzzle together and realizes that he, and not his wife, was the real target. Kimble breaks into sullied Sykes apartment for more information. Dr. Lentz, deceased (actually murdered) the previous year, and Kimble's supposed friend Dr. Charles Nichols (Jeroen Krabbe) falsified the records/research of the dangers of a new drug (RDU 90 = Provasic) that caused liver damage to line their pockets. Knowing that Kimble would be against them, they hired Sykes to do their dirty work. There is an altercation on the Chicago El with Kimble and Sykes. Kimble then heads for the Grand Ballroom where an honorary dinner is being held for Dr. Nichols, who is touting the dangerous new drug as a miracle. The final confrontation occurs on a rooftop and in a laundry room. The movie, focusing on two determined, smart, and hardy men pitted against each other, builds suspense and excitement with plausible situations (except for the dam leap, the origins of which may be Alfred Hitchcocks' 1942 feature, "Saboteur"). The chase is stronger than the murder plot, which can be confusing. But the performances are very good, and Harrison Ford certainly appears in his element although Tommy Lee Jones won the coveted Oscar. Although Sela Ward's character died early, flashbacks enhance her screen time. Great cinematography and on-location shooting are always a plus. A final word: Unlike many modern movies, the language is not vulgar. "The Fugitive" is enjoyable even after many viewings.

    Harry Ford, looking like.... well, Harry Ford (same haircut, same stupid look on his face), is accused by the cops - against all sensibility on their part - of killing his wife for her fortune, even though Ford's 'Dr. Richard Kimble' is wealthy in his own right. Over two solid hours of cat and mouse plays out between Ford and marshal Tom Lee Jones: FORD: "I didn't kill my wife!" JONES: "Yeah, you did. There he goes! Get him! Whoops! He got away!" AUDIENCE: "Yawnnnn.... zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz". Joe Pantoliano sports his worst toupee as Jones' moronic sidekick while Ron Dean tags along for laughs as one of several pig-headed cops who are sure they've got their man in Ford amidst all the circumstantial evidence. Long, boring, movie with no relief from all the running, ducking, dodging, and those highly intense scenes where Ford is searching for information on computer screens. Yeah, work that keyboard, Harry. Oh no, you pressed the wrong key! Better backspace fast! How Ford ever got a career in the movies should be listed in the Guiness World Book of Records under the category "Luckiest Motherfu***rs of All-Time".

    Harrison Ford is a brilliant actor end of story. You gotta love his performance in this film and im not gonna lie here but the 80s and 90s were the best films of all compare to now(except some of them that are brilliant like Shrek,Tangled etc). The Fugitive is based off a TV series of the same name and tells the story of a Doctor Kimple(played by Harrison Ford) who's wife got murdered by a one hand guy who lost his hand in an accident and wears a prosthetic hand.But none of the cops believe him when he is up in court as they thrown him in jail as they think HIS the one that murdered his own wife. But when the train that brings him to jail breaks down,Richard(sporting long grey hair and a bushy grey beard)goes on the run and changes his appearance(by dying and chopping his hair) as well as shaving off his beard in order for the police not to notice him and to prove that he is an innocent man. So when one of the FBI agents tracks him down(played by Tommy Lee Jones),Richard proves to him that he is telling the truth about the man with the prosthetic hand,but will Lee Jones' charcther believe his story and let Richard get away?? Bottom Line this movie was brilliant. You gotta love the story,you gotta love the acting and everything about this film is fantastic. I know I know its not aimed towards women like me,and I don't wanna sound racist when saying it but I for one would highly put this film in at no 20 on my list of all time favourite movies. Is it my all time favourite movie No but is it a great film YES. Also keep an eye out for Jane Lynch(a very young looking Lynch)from Glee and Julianne Moore.

    The Fugitive has its plot pulled out of an 80s TV show with credible success. I don't know if the fans of the original series liked it, but I did. The good. Captivating story. Well built scenario and characters resulting in a nice intrigue. Gripping pace that won't let you down and give you only a few pauses. Solid action and acting. The actors. Commendable work by Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones. The bad. Lee Jones' character and actions as well as his whole work structure are a bit over the top. The ugly. Nothing. The result. If you like intrigue, Ford, Lee Jones, or a story about a guy trying to clear his name, it's definitely for you. If you like action, you'll also find your entertainment. There's even a bit of romance and a cap on the violence so the ladies might find their own too.

    Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones do what they do best in this heart stopping man hunt. They give you their clich&eacute;d gawks, studied replies and cowboy humor. And we love 'em for it. We also have a murder investigation, accompanied by the flashbacks of convicted Dr. Kimbel while on the run. The supplemental plot surrounding a wonder drug drives the finale a bit more than necessary as Hollywood goes straight to the obligatory good versus evil fisticuffs. Up until then, the action scenes trump each other and are always held up by the drama. What man wouldn't be obsessed with finding the truth when having Sela ward taken from you in her prime? While the one-armed bandit stays true to the TV storyline, our doctor saving a little boys' life seemed a bit over the top, but this blockbuster film still holds up over time.

    The film starts directly with the story without going into establishing much in the starting. The story starts with Harrison ford being accused of his wife's murder. Now after seeing so many movies, it is inevitable for me to think, where the plot will eventually go. But the story is simple without paying much emphasis on twists. The man is falsely accused and runs away owing to unusual circumstances and then starts to work in order to prove his innocence. There is pretty much just the running away from the police in the entire film. The plot is simple and what makes the movie worth watching are its fascinating screenplay and the power to grab your heart. The casting is one of the best. It could not have been better. From the starting itself the undoubted innocence on the face of Harrison ford as Dr. kimbley is the clue for everyone that he is falsely accused. This is the entire film. I cannot spoil the movie further because there is nothing much in the plot. Tommy lee Jones on the other hand again looks so sympathizing as the police officer that I knew from the beginning that he is going to help in the end. The movie is the best example of how a very simple plot can be so exciting. I was bound to think whether there can be a formula to make successful films. However, at times I got irritated at how he is able to escape always just from under the nose but then the innocent look on his face doesn't allow to go deeper into that. The film is very much normal and one of the best at the same times. MESSAGE: "Everyone gets a chance." VERDICT: "A recommended watch."

    Before watching this film I read that it was based on a 1960s TV series, that much of the dialogue was improvised, and that the script was still being written as filming started. That didn't bode well because, as we know, actors are interminably capable of speech, but dialogue is something different. However, maybe this is the exception to the rule, as Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones are both brilliant in their roles and if much of that was improvised, all credit to them. Jones got the Oscar for his role as by Lt. Gerard but Ford is equally impressive as the wronged Dr Richard Kimble, falsely accused of the murder of his wife (Sela Ward). We see her mostly in flashback and this is a believable relationship, unlike in the sequel using Wesley Snipes in the Ford role. The film is a cat and mouse chase as Gerard pursues Kimble through various settings. The sense of tension, perfectly backed by the music of James Newton Howard, builds like in a Hitchcock movie, which is a credit to director Andrew Davis. Michael Chapman's cinematography is crisp and sharp and clinical. Perfect for this film. As Kimble is being hunted by Gerard, he is himself hunting for the mysterious one-armed man who was the real murderer of his wife, but what was the motive? Using his medical knowledge and his analytical skill he aims to find his quarry before Gerard finds him! But Gerard is also piecing the truth together. Simple plot that twists and turns as it develops. In a sense you find yourself rooting for both men as they both come across as warm and intelligent, pursing their intertwined goals. I really can't find fault here. This is one of the top films ever. Why the IMDb rating is so low, I don't know. I'll do what I can to move it up a bit.

    Seeing the Nick Love big screen version of THE SWEENEY I was struck as to how cynical the marketing was . It could be any high octane thriller set around a bunch of bank robbers in London with a crime squad led by a rough diamond cop trying to bring the crooks to book . In other words it's simply called THE SWEENEY because it's got a ready made market for people who fondly remember the original TV show . This is pre-dated by this big screen version of the television show of THE FUGITIVE which features Harrison Ford playing a character called Dr Richard Kimble being pursued by a cop called Gerard in a film that is nothing more than a cynical exercise in trying to cash in on a half remembered TV show from yesteryear . That is not to say it's a bad film as such but anyone expecting anything along the lines of the TV original won't recognise this film as sharing anything in common with the David Janssen series As it stands if you like loud , brash , action packed muliplex entertainment then you'll certainly enjoy this movie . The downside is that you have to take the rough with the smooth and this comes in the form of plot contrivance . Interestingly the original court case is skated over and the audience never given a reason why Kimble is found guilty of the murder of his wife . Of course sharing the name of the TV series THE FUGITIVE and a character played by Harrison Ford in 1993 the audience know Kimble must be innocent but even so the evidence must have been rather damning . Being a contrived plot means that in order for the story to progress more and more ludicrous things involving good luck/bad luck has to happen which strains credibility when you stop to think about anything . The shark is well and truly jumped relatively early in the film where Kimble takes a dive of a dam falling several hundred feet in to a waterfall which must contain several thousand tons of water and surviving This sequence ties in with the protagonist's nemesis US Marshall Samuel Gerard who has the almostsupernatural ability to be one step ahead of the other characters . Kimble disappears in a blocked off tunnel ? He's obviously escaped down a drain . He jumps off the top of a dam ? He's obviously survived the fall . He looks through some garbage and concludes Kimble is using a false ID One almost hopes Gerard does something credible such as throw his hands up and say " Hey guys the trail has gone cold " but I guess that would mean less tension and excitement in a film that merely exists to wretch up tension and excitement to a multiplex audience . A fact reflected in its massive box office takings

    In the popular TV series of the same name (1963-1967), David Janssen played the lead role of a doctor who had been tried, convicted, and sentenced to die for the murder of his wife. The doctor, Richard Kimble, was innocent of the crime. Because of a train wreck, Kimble was able to escape and subsequently search for the one-armed man that he knew was the real culprit. Folks tuned in every week to see how the doctor fared. Despite many close calls and being fanatically pursued by a relentless Lt. Gerard, Kimble remained elusive. Finally, after four years, Kimble and his quarry were trapped atop a water tower in the presence of Gerard, who shot the one-armed murderer from the ground. That final episode on a Tuesday in August of 1967 garnered a 72 percent share of all USA TV viewers. The 1993 movie of the same name maintains the same premise although the plot is rather different. An innocent doctor (now a vascular surgeon), Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) is on the run and is, at the same time, trying to locate the one-armed murderer of his wife, Helen Kimble (Sela Ward) before the authorities close in and execute him. In the movie's brief prologue, all available evidence had pointed to the doctor's guilt. The sentence was surprising and unusually swift. So, without any hope for deliverance, he finds himself handcuffed while riding in a prison bus to his hapless destiny. Directly because of a m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, the bus tumbles down an embankment directly onto train tracks. The massive collision of a freight train and the bus is as sensational as ever seen on screen. The locomotive may be derailed, but its momentum chases Kimble as he desperately runs for his life (No models: The train and bus were real!). Skillfully able to evade his pursuers, Dr. Kimble works his way back to Chicago where he resumes contacts with his friends and sympathizers. With few places to lick his wounds in a hostile winter and with no resources  and even slightly wounded  Kimble somehow defies the odds and stays free. See how he casually walks into a hospital, and, as a doctor knows exactly what to do: (1) self treat his wound, (2) grab a quick meal, (3) shave his beard, (4) clean up, (5) find suitable clothing, and (6) leave in an ambulance. Kimble's pursuit is led by Deputy US Marshal Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones). Gerard is obsessed with catching Kimble, and his manhunt is on a massive scale. Tommy Lee Jones as Gerard, whose screen presence is immense, is steadfast in his mission. He is alert, intelligent, and weather-beaten, and leaves no doubt who is in charge. He often adopts a superior tone. But, in the course of the film, as new facts are presented, Gerard's facial expressions and body language subtlety change as he comes to realize that the beleaguered surgeon may be innocent after all. Yet, he doggedly keeps up the chase, as he has a job to do, and not judge (Kimble: "I didn't kill my wife!" Gerard: "I don't care!"). He has a team that includes right-hand man Cosmo Renfro (Joe Pantoliano), Erin Poole (L. Scott Campbell), Noah Newman (Tom Wood), and Biggs (Daniel Roebuck). There are other characters, like Kelly and Rosetti of the Chicago Police Department; Kelly is especially adamant about Kimble's guilt right up to the very end. Meanwhile Kimble, using his brains as well as his wits, is eventually able to gain access to Cook County Hospital, where he searches for those who have prosthetic right arms. The doctor narrows the search to a manageable five names. He finds one man, a Frederick Sykes (Andreas Katsulas), an ex-policeman working in the security business. In the meantime Kimble finds a place to stay in a Polish woman's basement apartment. He is betrayed by her drug-dealing son but escapes. Back in the hospital, Kimble is instrumental in saving a boy's life by a quick diagnosis and altering the regular hospital doctor's instructions. Kimble meticulously pieces the puzzle together and realizes that he, and not his wife, was the real target. Kimble breaks into sullied Sykes apartment for more information. Dr. Lentz, deceased (actually murdered) the previous year, and Kimble's supposed friend Dr. Charles Nichols (Jeroen Krabbe) falsified the records/research of the dangers of a new drug (RDU 90 = Provasic) that caused liver damage to line their pockets. Knowing that Kimble would be against them, they hired Sykes to do their dirty work. There is an altercation on the Chicago El with Kimble and Sykes. Kimble then heads for the Grand Ballroom where an honorary dinner is being held for Dr. Nichols, who is touting the dangerous new drug as a miracle. The final confrontation occurs on a rooftop and in a laundry room. The movie, focusing on two determined, smart, and hardy men pitted against each other, builds suspense and excitement with plausible situations (except for the dam leap, the origins of which may be Alfred Hitchcocks' 1942 feature, "Saboteur"). The chase is stronger than the murder plot, which can be confusing.

However, maybe this is the exception to the rule, as Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones are both brilliant in their roles and if much of that was improvised, all credit to them. Jones got the Oscar for his role as by Lt. Gerard but Ford is equally impressive as the wronged Dr Richard Kimble, falsely accused of the murder of his wife (Sela Ward). We see her mostly in flashback and this is a believable relationship, unlike in the sequel using Wesley Snipes in the Ford role. The film is a cat and mouse chase as Gerard pursues Kimble through various settings. The sense of tension, perfectly backed by the music of James Newton Howard, builds like in a Hitchcock movie, which is a credit to director Andrew Davis. Michael Chapman's cinematography is crisp and sharp and clinical. Perfect for this film. As Kimble is being hunted by Gerard, he is himself hunting for the mysterious one-armed man who was the real murderer of his wife, but what was the motive? Using his medical knowledge and his analytical skill he aims to find his quarry before Gerard finds him! But Gerard is also piecing the truth together. Simple plot that twists and turns as it develops. In a sense you find yourself rooting for both men as they both come across as warm and intelligent, pursing their intertwined goals. I really can't find fault here. This is one of the top films ever. Why the IMDb rating is so low, I don't know. I'll do what I can to move it up a bit.

    Seeing the Nick Love big screen version of THE SWEENEY I was struck as to how cynical the marketing was . It could be any high octane thriller set around a bunch of bank robbers in London with a crime squad led by a rough diamond cop trying to bring the crooks to book . In other words it's simply called THE SWEENEY because it's got a ready made market for people who fondly remember the original TV show . This is pre-dated by this big screen version of the television show of THE FUGITIVE which features Harrison Ford playing a character called Dr Richard Kimble being pursued by a cop called Gerard in a film that is nothing more than a cynical exercise in trying to cash in on a half remembered TV show from yesteryear . That is not to say it's a bad film as such but anyone expecting anything along the lines of the TV original won't recognise this film as sharing anything in common with the David Janssen series As it stands if you like loud , brash , action packed muliplex entertainment then you'll certainly enjoy this movie . The downside is that you have to take the rough with the smooth and this comes in the form of plot contrivance . Interestingly the original court case is skated over and the audience never given a reason why Kimble is found guilty of the murder of his wife . Of course sharing the name of the TV series THE FUGITIVE and a character played by Harrison Ford in 1993 the audience know Kimble must be innocent but even so the evidence must have been rather damning . Being a contrived plot means that in order for the story to progress more and more ludicrous things involving good luck/bad luck has to happen which strains credibility when you stop to think about anything . The shark is well and truly jumped relatively early in the film where Kimble takes a dive of a dam falling several hundred feet in to a waterfall which must contain several thousand tons of water and surviving This sequence ties in with the protagonist's nemesis US Marshall Samuel Gerard who has the almostsupernatural ability to be one step ahead of the other characters . Kimble disappears in a blocked off tunnel ? He's obviously escaped down a drain . He jumps off the top of a dam ? He's obviously survived the fall . He looks through some garbage and concludes Kimble is using a false ID One almost hopes Gerard does something credible such as throw his hands up and say " Hey guys the trail has gone cold " but I guess that would mean less tension and excitement in a film that merely exists to wretch up tension and excitement to a multiplex audience . A fact reflected in its massive box office takings

    In the popular TV series of the same name (1963-1967), David Janssen played the lead role of a doctor who had been tried, convicted, and sentenced to die for the murder of his wife. The doctor, Richard Kimble, was innocent of the crime. Because of a train wreck, Kimble was able to escape and subsequently search for the one-armed man that he knew was the real culprit. Folks tuned in every week to see how the doctor fared. Despite many close calls and being fanatically pursued by a relentless Lt. Gerard, Kimble remained elusive. Finally, after four years, Kimble and his quarry were trapped atop a water tower in the presence of Gerard, who shot the one-armed murderer from the ground. That final episode on a Tuesday in August of 1967 garnered a 72 percent share of all USA TV viewers. The 1993 movie of the same name maintains the same premise although the plot is rather different. An innocent doctor (now a vascular surgeon), Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) is on the run and is, at the same time, trying to locate the one-armed murderer of his wife, Helen Kimble (Sela Ward) before the authorities close in and execute him. In the movie's brief prologue, all available evidence had pointed to the doctor's guilt. The sentence was surprising and unusually swift. So, without any hope for deliverance, he finds himself handcuffed while riding in a prison bus to his hapless destiny. Directly because of a m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, the bus tumbles down an embankment directly onto train tracks. The massive collision of a freight train and the bus is as sensational as ever seen on screen. The locomotive may be derailed, but its momentum chases Kimble as he desperately runs for his life (No models: The train and bus were real!). Skillfully able to evade his pursuers, Dr. Kimble works his way back to Chicago where he resumes contacts with his friends and sympathizers. With few places to lick his wounds in a hostile winter and with no resources  and even slightly wounded  Kimble somehow defies the odds and stays free. See how he casually walks into a hospital, and, as a doctor knows exactly what to do: (1) self treat his wound, (2) grab a quick meal, (3) shave his beard, (4) clean up, (5) find suitable clothing, and (6) leave in an ambulance. Kimble's pursuit is led by Deputy US Marshal Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones). Gerard is obsessed with catching Kimble, and his manhunt is on a massive scale. Tommy Lee Jones as Gerard, whose screen presence is immense, is steadfast in his mission. He is alert, intelligent, and weather-beaten, and leaves no doubt who is in charge. He often adopts a superior tone. But, in the course of the film, as new facts are presented, Gerard's facial expressions and body language subtlety change as he comes to realize that the beleaguered surgeon may be innocent after all. Yet, he doggedly keeps up the chase, as he has a job to do, and not judge (Kimble: "I didn't kill my wife!" Gerard: "I don't care!"). He has a team that includes right-hand man Cosmo Renfro (Joe Pantoliano), Erin Poole (L. Scott Campbell), Noah Newman (Tom Wood), and Biggs (Daniel Roebuck). There are other characters, like Kelly and Rosetti of the Chicago Police Department; Kelly is especially adamant about Kimble's guilt right up to the very end. Meanwhile Kimble, using his brains as well as his wits, is eventually able to gain access to Cook County Hospital, where he searches for those who have prosthetic right arms. The doctor narrows the search to a manageable five names. He finds one man, a Frederick Sykes (Andreas Katsulas), an ex-policeman working in the security business. In the meantime Kimble finds a place to stay in a Polish woman's basement apartment. He is betrayed by her drug-dealing son but escapes. Back in the hospital, Kimble is instrumental in saving a boy's life by a quick diagnosis and altering the regular hospital doctor's instructions. Kimble meticulously pieces the puzzle together and realizes that he, and not his wife, was the real target. Kimble breaks into sullied Sykes apartment for more information. Dr. Lentz, deceased (actually murdered) the previous year, and Kimble's supposed friend Dr. Charles Nichols (Jeroen Krabbe) falsified the records/research of the dangers of a new drug (RDU 90 = Provasic) that caused liver damage to line their pockets. Knowing that Kimble would be against them, they hired Sykes to do their dirty work. There is an altercation on the Chicago El with Kimble and Sykes. Kimble then heads for the Grand Ballroom where an honorary dinner is being held for Dr. Nichols, who is touting the dangerous new drug as a miracle. The final confrontation occurs on a rooftop and in a laundry room. The movie, focusing on two determined, smart, and hardy men pitted against each other, builds suspense and excitement with plausible situations (except for the dam leap, the origins of which may be Alfred Hitchcocks' 1942 feature, "Saboteur"). The chase is stronger than the murder plot, which can be confusing. But the performances are very good, and Harrison Ford certainly appears in his element although Tommy Lee Jones won the coveted Oscar. Although Sela Ward's character died early, flashbacks enhance her screen time. Great cinematography and on-location shooting are always a plus. A final word: Unlike many modern movies, the language is not vulgar. "The Fugitive" is enjoyable even after many viewings.

    Harry Ford, looking like.... well, Harry Ford (same haircut, same stupid look on his face), is accused by the cops - against all sensibility on their part - of killing his wife for her fortune, even though Ford's 'Dr. Richard Kimble' is wealthy in his own right. Over two solid hours of cat and mouse plays out between Ford and marshal Tom Lee Jones: FORD: "I didn't kill my wife!" JONES: "Yeah, you did. There he goes! Get him! Whoops! He got away!" AUDIENCE: "Yawnnnn.... zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz". Joe Pantoliano sports his worst toupee as Jones' moronic sidekick while Ron Dean tags along for laughs as one of several pig-headed cops who are sure they've got their man in Ford amidst all the circumstantial evidence. Long, boring, movie with no relief from all the running, ducking, dodging, and those highly intense scenes where Ford is searching for information on computer screens. Yeah, work that keyboard, Harry. Oh no, you pressed the wrong key! Better backspace fast! How Ford ever got a career in the movies should be listed in the Guiness World Book of Records under the category "Luckiest Motherfu***rs of All-Time".

    if this isn't the best ever adaptation from a TV series to a movie I don't know what is.. please tell me because I would like to know what would top this one.. the story of the one armed man is back finally 30 years in the making , I remember bits and pieces from the old TV show which I intend to find somewhere and own one day, because I never finished seeing the whole season,, so you have a shortened version here, Tommy Lee Jones,, vs. Harrison Ford,, plain and simple,, our Marshall and his crackpot team must figure out a way to catch the very elusive and dapper, Dr. Richard Kimble ,, who we all know did not kill his wife,, but with all the mounting evidence,, and the good Dr's total lack of his whereabouts, it's really kind of hard to believe him.. on his way to prison, the train flips over, and presto , the Dr. is now on the run,, I personally love the dam jump scene,, and the part where the Marshall says he just doesn't give a damn. what a wonderful action movie,, lot's of suspense great plot,, scenery acting,, a perfect movie with the perfect actors of that time period playing those parts.

    Harrison Ford is a brilliant actor end of story. You gotta love his performance in this film and im not gonna lie here but the 80s and 90s were the best films of all compare to now(except some of them that are brilliant like Shrek,Tangled etc). The Fugitive is based off a TV series of the same name and tells the story of a Doctor Kimple(played by Harrison Ford) who's wife got murdered by a one hand guy who lost his hand in an accident and wears a prosthetic hand.But none of the cops believe him when he is up in court as they thrown him in jail as they think HIS the one that murdered his own wife. But when the train that brings him to jail breaks down,Richard(sporting long grey hair and a bushy grey beard)goes on the run and changes his appearance(by dying and chopping his hair) as well as shaving off his beard in order for the police not to notice him and to prove that he is an innocent man. So when one of the FBI agents tracks him down(played by Tommy Lee Jones),Richard proves to him that he is telling the truth about the man with the prosthetic hand,but will Lee Jones' charcther believe his story and let Richard get away?? Bottom Line this movie was brilliant. You gotta love the story,you gotta love the acting and everything about this film is fantastic. I know I know its not aimed towards women like me,and I don't wanna sound racist when saying it but I for one would highly put this film in at no 20 on my list of all time favourite movies. Is it my all time favourite movie No but is it a great film YES. Also keep an eye out for Jane Lynch(a very young looking Lynch)from Glee and Julianne Moore.

    The Fugitive has its plot pulled out of an 80s TV show with credible success. I don't know if the fans of the original series liked it, but I did. The good. Captivating story. Well built scenario and characters resulting in a nice intrigue. Gripping pace that won't let you down and give you only a few pauses. Solid action and acting. The actors. Commendable work by Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones. The bad. Lee Jones' character and actions as well as his whole work structure are a bit over the top. The ugly. Nothing. The result. If you like intrigue, Ford, Lee Jones, or a story about a guy trying to clear his name, it's definitely for you. If you like action, you'll also find your entertainment. There's even a bit of romance and a cap on the violence so the ladies might find their own too.

    Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones do what they do best in this heart stopping man hunt. They give you their clich&eacute;d gawks, studied replies and cowboy humor. And we love 'em for it. We also have a murder investigation, accompanied by the flashbacks of convicted Dr. Kimbel while on the run. The supplemental plot surrounding a wonder drug drives the finale a bit more than necessary as Hollywood goes straight to the obligatory good versus evil fisticuffs. Up until then, the action scenes trump each other and are always held up by the drama. What man wouldn't be obsessed with finding the truth when having Sela ward taken from you in her prime? While the one-armed bandit stays true to the TV storyline, our doctor saving a little boys' life seemed a bit over the top, but this blockbuster film still holds up over time.

    The film starts directly with the story without going into establishing much in the starting. The story starts with Harrison ford being accused of his wife's murder. Now after seeing so many movies, it is inevitable for me to think, where the plot will eventually go. But the story is simple without paying much emphasis on twists. The man is falsely accused and runs away owing to unusual circumstances and then starts to work in order to prove his innocence. There is pretty much just the running away from the police in the entire film. The plot is simple and what makes the movie worth watching are its fascinating screenplay and the power to grab your heart. The casting is one of the best. It could not have been better. From the starting itself the undoubted innocence on the face of Harrison ford as Dr. kimbley is the clue for everyone that he is falsely accused. This is the entire film. I cannot spoil the movie further because there is nothing much in the plot. Tommy lee Jones on the other hand again looks so sympathizing as the police officer that I knew from the beginning that he is going to help in the end. The movie is the best example of how a very simple plot can be so exciting. I was bound to think whether there can be a formula to make successful films. However, at times I got irritated at how he is able to escape always just from under the nose but then the innocent look on his face doesn't allow to go deeper into that. The film is very much normal and one of the best at the same times. MESSAGE: "Everyone gets a chance." VERDICT: "A recommended watch."

Long, boring, movie with no relief from all the running, ducking, dodging, and those highly intense scenes where Ford is searching for information on computer screens. Yeah, work that keyboard, Harry. Oh no, you pressed the wrong key! Better backspace fast! How Ford ever got a career in the movies should be listed in the Guiness World Book of Records under the category "Luckiest Motherfu***rs of All-Time".

    if this isn't the best ever adaptation from a TV series to a movie I don't know what is.. please tell me because I would like to know what would top this one.. the story of the one armed man is back finally 30 years in the making , I remember bits and pieces from the old TV show which I intend to find somewhere and own one day, because I never finished seeing the whole season,, so you have a shortened version here, Tommy Lee Jones,, vs. Harrison Ford,, plain and simple,, our Marshall and his crackpot team must figure out a way to catch the very elusive and dapper, Dr. Richard Kimble ,, who we all know did not kill his wife,, but with all the mounting evidence,, and the good Dr's total lack of his whereabouts, it's really kind of hard to believe him.. on his way to prison, the train flips over, and presto , the Dr. is now on the run,, I personally love the dam jump scene,, and the part where the Marshall says he just doesn't give a damn. what a wonderful action movie,, lot's of suspense great plot,, scenery acting,, a perfect movie with the perfect actors of that time period playing those parts.

    Harrison Ford is a brilliant actor end of story. You gotta love his performance in this film and im not gonna lie here but the 80s and 90s were the best films of all compare to now(except some of them that are brilliant like Shrek,Tangled etc). The Fugitive is based off a TV series of the same name and tells the story of a Doctor Kimple(played by Harrison Ford) who's wife got murdered by a one hand guy who lost his hand in an accident and wears a prosthetic hand.But none of the cops believe him when he is up in court as they thrown him in jail as they think HIS the one that murdered his own wife. But when the train that brings him to jail breaks down,Richard(sporting long grey hair and a bushy grey beard)goes on the run and changes his appearance(by dying and chopping his hair) as well as shaving off his beard in order for the police not to notice him and to prove that he is an innocent man. So when one of the FBI agents tracks him down(played by Tommy Lee Jones),Richard proves to him that he is telling the truth about the man with the prosthetic hand,but will Lee Jones' charcther believe his story and let Richard get away?? Bottom Line this movie was brilliant. You gotta love the story,you gotta love the acting and everything about this film is fantastic. I know I know its not aimed towards women like me,and I don't wanna sound racist when saying it but I for one would highly put this film in at no 20 on my list of all time favourite movies. Is it my all time favourite movie No but is it a great film YES. Also keep an eye out for Jane Lynch(a very young looking Lynch)from Glee and Julianne Moore.

    The Fugitive has its plot pulled out of an 80s TV show with credible success. I don't know if the fans of the original series liked it, but I did. The good. Captivating story. Well built scenario and characters resulting in a nice intrigue. Gripping pace that won't let you down and give you only a few pauses. Solid action and acting. The actors. Commendable work by Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones. The bad. Lee Jones' character and actions as well as his whole work structure are a bit over the top. The ugly. Nothing. The result. If you like intrigue, Ford, Lee Jones, or a story about a guy trying to clear his name, it's definitely for you. If you like action, you'll also find your entertainment. There's even a bit of romance and a cap on the violence so the ladies might find their own too.

    Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones do what they do best in this heart stopping man hunt. They give you their clich&eacute;d gawks, studied replies and cowboy humor. And we love 'em for it. We also have a murder investigation, accompanied by the flashbacks of convicted Dr. Kimbel while on the run. The supplemental plot surrounding a wonder drug drives the finale a bit more than necessary as Hollywood goes straight to the obligatory good versus evil fisticuffs. Up until then, the action scenes trump each other and are always held up by the drama. What man wouldn't be obsessed with finding the truth when having Sela ward taken from you in her prime? While the one-armed bandit stays true to the TV storyline, our doctor saving a little boys' life seemed a bit over the top, but this blockbuster film still holds up over time.

    The film starts directly with the story without going into establishing much in the starting. The story starts with Harrison ford being accused of his wife's murder. Now after seeing so many movies, it is inevitable for me to think, where the plot will eventually go. But the story is simple without paying much emphasis on twists. The man is falsely accused and runs away owing to unusual circumstances and then starts to work in order to prove his innocence. There is pretty much just the running away from the police in the entire film. The plot is simple and what makes the movie worth watching are its fascinating screenplay and the power to grab your heart. The casting is one of the best. It could not have been better. From the starting itself the undoubted innocence on the face of Harrison ford as Dr. kimbley is the clue for everyone that he is falsely accused. This is the entire film. I cannot spoil the movie further because there is nothing much in the plot. Tommy lee Jones on the other hand again looks so sympathizing as the police officer that I knew from the beginning that he is going to help in the end. The movie is the best example of how a very simple plot can be so exciting. I was bound to think whether there can be a formula to make successful films. However, at times I got irritated at how he is able to escape always just from under the nose but then the innocent look on his face doesn't allow to go deeper into that. The film is very much normal and one of the best at the same times. MESSAGE: "Everyone gets a chance." VERDICT: "A recommended watch."

    Before watching this film I read that it was based on a 1960s TV series, that much of the dialogue was improvised, and that the script was still being written as filming started. That didn't bode well because, as we know, actors are interminably capable of speech, but dialogue is something different. However, maybe this is the exception to the rule, as Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones are both brilliant in their roles and if much of that was improvised, all credit to them. Jones got the Oscar for his role as by Lt. Gerard but Ford is equally impressive as the wronged Dr Richard Kimble, falsely accused of the murder of his wife (Sela Ward). We see her mostly in flashback and this is a believable relationship, unlike in the sequel using Wesley Snipes in the Ford role. The film is a cat and mouse chase as Gerard pursues Kimble through various settings. The sense of tension, perfectly backed by the music of James Newton Howard, builds like in a Hitchcock movie, which is a credit to director Andrew Davis. Michael Chapman's cinematography is crisp and sharp and clinical. Perfect for this film. As Kimble is being hunted by Gerard, he is himself hunting for the mysterious one-armed man who was the real murderer of his wife, but what was the motive? Using his medical knowledge and his analytical skill he aims to find his quarry before Gerard finds him! But Gerard is also piecing the truth together. Simple plot that twists and turns as it develops. In a sense you find yourself rooting for both men as they both come across as warm and intelligent, pursing their intertwined goals. I really can't find fault here. This is one of the top films ever. Why the IMDb rating is so low, I don't know. I'll do what I can to move it up a bit.

    Chase Movie That Often Jumps The Shark

    Seeing the Nick Love big screen version of THE SWEENEY I was struck as to how cynical the marketing was . It could be any high octane thriller set around a bunch of bank robbers in London with a crime squad led by a rough diamond cop trying to bring the crooks to book . In other words it's simply called THE SWEENEY because it's got a ready made market for people who fondly remember the original TV show . This is pre-dated by this big screen version of the television show of THE FUGITIVE which features Harrison Ford playing a character called Dr Richard Kimble being pursued by a cop called Gerard in a film that is nothing more than a cynical exercise in trying to cash in on a half remembered TV show from yesteryear . That is not to say it's a bad film as such but anyone expecting anything along the lines of the TV original won't recognise this film as sharing anything in common with the David Janssen series As it stands if you like loud , brash , action packed muliplex entertainment then you'll certainly enjoy this movie . The downside is that you have to take the rough with the smooth and this comes in the form of plot contrivance . Interestingly the original court case is skated over and the audience never given a reason why Kimble is found guilty of the murder of his wife . Of course sharing the name of the TV series THE FUGITIVE and a character played by Harrison Ford in 1993 the audience know Kimble must be innocent but even so the evidence must have been rather damning . Being a contrived plot means that in order for the story to progress more and more ludicrous things involving good luck/bad luck has to happen which strains credibility when you stop to think about anything . The shark is well and truly jumped relatively early in the film where Kimble takes a dive of a dam falling several hundred feet in to a waterfall which must contain several thousand tons of water and surviving This sequence ties in with the protagonist's nemesis US Marshall Samuel Gerard who has the almostsupernatural ability to be one step ahead of the other characters . Kimble disappears in a blocked off tunnel ? He's obviously escaped down a drain . He jumps off the top of a dam ? He's obviously survived the fall . He looks through some garbage and concludes Kimble is using a false ID One almost hopes Gerard does something credible such as throw his hands up and say " Hey guys the trail has gone cold " but I guess that would mean less tension and excitement in a film that merely exists to wretch up tension and excitement to a multiplex audience . A fact reflected in its massive box office takings
