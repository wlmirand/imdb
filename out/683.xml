    Awesome movie. It's a Disney movie so it's got all the rough edges smoothed down, the level of 'offensive' has been completely focus group polished out of it. The closest we get is one of the movies flattest jokes about flatulence in space. Despite this, it has aged very well and remains one of the absolute best quotable funny movies ever made. This is chiefly due to the charisma of the lead character, a Poindexter computer scientist cum everyman who somehow manages to not only become an astronaut candidate but also ends up on a flight mission to Mars. Parts of this were filmed at Johnson Space Center and for the time is reasonably realistic to the look and work. I've got a friend who was an uncredited extra in this and according to him they used a lot of NASA engineers as extras too. If you like slapstick and absurd comedy it is hard to do better than this, and the bonus is you can watch it with your kids. Highly recommended for fans of off kilter absurdness. There are some low points, such as the pointless (yet still funny) shoehorned romance, and the complete waste of Beau Bridges and William Sadler who both play it straight. This is not an ensemble movie, it is nearly completely driven by the comedy timing and dialog of Harland Williams. This movie desperately needs the full BluRay treatment with commentary from all the principles.

    Fred Z. Randall is a geeky spacecraft designer, who gets the chance to make his dream come true. Travel to Mars as a member of the first manned flight there.... Liking this film really depends on whether or not you like the main star, Harland Williams. Here in the UK, he's only really famous for his scene in Dumb and Dumber, and everything else he's done non-Farrelly, has gone straight to DVD and disappeared without a trace. What appealed to me about this movie, and you will know where I am coming from if you've read my other reviews, is that its one of those films from the late nineties that were rife and were released almost every other week. Comedies that shouldn't be good, but for some reason, you seem to have some endearment for them. Carpool, Gone Fishin', Most Wanted, the list is endless, and the films are as watchable as ever. It's a straight forward movie, silly geek gets a job that is over his head, every one hates him and takes liberties to begin with, but come the end, he's the hero and he falls in love. It's straight forward silly stuff, with a few laughs that you can switch your brain off to for ninety or so minutes. If you haven't seen it and like this sort of movies, catch it, its quite funny

    Rocketman is amazingly funny - a top favorite comedy of mine, especially in the underrated category. I put two other movies along side this one in this category - Down Periscope, with Kelsey Grammar and, once again, Harland Williams, and Bushwacked with Daniel Stern (City Slickers). These 3 movies are simply hilarious and are excellent selections to play for others, since they probably haven't seen them, and they're perfect for playing when families are over, because the kids and the adults all enjoy them. Harland Williams is a phenomenal actor and is a perfect fit for his role in this movie - his only starring role in a movie, I believe. It's such a shame that he hasn't starred in more movies and that he's been in so many duds. It seems like he has become a solid bit-part actor, which is such a waste of his talent. He was excellent in Down Periscope, where he made sounds like a whale. His facial expressions and ability to make odd sounds are simply amazing. Rocketman has a superb cast and many memorable parts and lines. I especially like the opening segment where Kelsey Grammar is teeing off, and the fart segment, which I know is the tried and true crude humor attempt, but it just works - even better than the famous fart segment of The Nutty Professor! The love story is very nice and the "Wish Upon a Star" song is a real Disney moment. This is an excellent family Great film!

    Hilarious. I've always felt that 'Rocketman' was one of Disney's best and most under-appreciated live-action films of the last thirty years. It has so many elements of the traditional formula that makes it so Disney, as a die-hard fan, I find it hard to resist. This film is a homage to so much of what Disney loved. It really is a reference to the innovative 'Man in Space' series from the 1950's 'Wonderful World of Disney', and from movies like Disney's 60's comedy 'Moon Pilot'. Not to mention the references to Pinocchio. Harland Williams is not exactly the type of comedian you would expect to see in a family comedy, but then again, neither is Eddie Murphy or even, say Buddy Hackett, for that matter. All of those comics have a pretty raunchy sense of humour outside of their Disney films. I've seen William's stand up humour outside of 'Rocketman', and it is pretty vulgar and college. In this Disney film it is completely wholesome and harmless with perhaps the exception of a scene that features drunkenness. The only thing that may possibly offend is the reference to evolution at the expense of Michelangelo and the Vatican ceiling. But hey. Disney himself was a devout Christian who didn't bother to question science. Very few people did in the 50's. Ever been to a Disney park and seen the different stages of man in evolution? I have. Seen 'Spaceship Earth'? I have. Need I go on? I bet you wish I wouldn't. Look it's not our fault yall wanna start all over again. This might just well prove to be the funniest if not the most controversial film experience of the twentieth century next to '2001: A Space Odyssey'. Anyway you feel on the subject of evolution, this film will blow your roof and rocket you to Mars and beyond.

    Slapstick run amok is about the closest that human speech can come to describing this movie. As it careens in random directions, you scratch your head trying to figure out what's going on, and wondering if you missed something. It's worth a laugh, at least on the level of laughing at how amateurish and childish it is. The Pee Wee Herman look-alike act-alike screaming with that exaggerated shrill voice at cover-the-ears intensity reaches the pain threshold at times. His acting is fine, but the director has him going over the top way too often. At anything. Every scene. Here's the deal: a bumbling but gifted computer geek gets tapped to be on the first manned landing on Mars. Don't ask. With two other people and a chimp (no, really). The chimp mugs, and so does quasi-Pee-Wee. When he's not screeching that is. Pee Wee from the Mars lander gets the whole world to sing campfire songs: I'm surprised somebody didn't just shoot him down. More goofy stuff happens on the voyage, each joke dumber than the last. The likable cast makes the most of the low-brow material. This one's only popcorn filler stuff, though.

    Okay, It's been 12 years since this movie came out. I was 4 when it was released. I first saw it on Disney Channel, and after that...I STILL CANT GET THE IMAGE OF HARLAND SCREAMING IN PAIN WHEN THE CHIMP BITES HIM! Rolling around in that office with the clearly stuffed monkey. In a regular movie this would be seen as cheesy and childish. OH NOT ROCKETMAN SIR, NO NOT THIS. I have seen a lot of Harland Williams movies: his older ones: Dumb and Dumber(C'mon give it here you pumpkin pie haircutted freak!) Half Baked(Oh you like popcorn don't'ya?Makes your teeth go,POPPOPaPOP!) even his creepier but funny uncredited role in Something About Mary (Why do 8 minute abs when there's 6 minute abs?!) Rocketman(Commander are you sure were heading towards planet earth it looks a lot like the sun! Don't question my authority you incompetent fool!AGAAHhhhhhaahahaha..mornin!) And of course Freddy got Fingered (his scream alone is hilarious: AAAAHUeueee!!!AAAAAHueeee!!!HEEEHAhhHEEHAahhAAAAAHuee!!!) Even his newer stuff Employee of the Month and hes got his new sketch movie Child wild But I think Rocketman is him at his best!

    I have no idea why this movie got so many bad reviews, it is awesome. I can't think of a single movie that made me laugh harder. I saw Rocketman in theaters back in the mid-90's, I laughed so hard I literally fell out of my seat. Harland Willims is seriously underrated. Just the part where he has to connect his space suite to William Sadlers (another excellent actor), makes the movie worth watching. Overall, I say this is one of the best Disney movies to come out in the 1990's. It's clean enough for the whole family to watch and is entertaining to both adults and children. 10 out of 10

    You just can't help but love this movie if there is even a little kid left in you at all. Yes a lot of the humor is juvenile but it still is just plain fun all around. Whenever I just want to sit and laugh and forget the stress in my life this is the movie I pop in. Do yourself a favor and indulge in a little low brow humor once in awhile. The entire cast is perfect for this film even the monkey just fits perfect. I don't understand the few negative reviews left for rocket man. You have to have no sense of humor what so ever. If all you like is high brow intellectual indie films then why did you watch this movie in the first place. It is a pure good natured funny fest.

    When I first saw this movie there were times I was laughing so much and so hard that I had trouble catching my breath! Sometimes ya need an ultra-slapstick, goofy movie to dump the weight of the world right off your shoulders and this movie did it for me. Harland Williams is a comic actor genius. HA! The film is a sensational rarity where kids and adults can just be total laughing fools at Williams' antics in this comic "masterpiece of resistance." Lordy, right from the beginning, clear through to the end, the impressive comic craft work, hilarious jokes and physical comedy does not let up. Harland Williams is, without doubt, one of THE most funny actors in the business and I wish that we could all see him in more films. The cool thing about this film is that it sure spits in the eye of all of the pretentious movie snobs who would look down on this film labeling it "unsophisticated, sophomoric" base humor...in reality, this work shows all of us where REAL comedy can take us...like on a ride that is just as thrilling as any hyped up amusement park roller coaster! A GREAT MOVIE FOR ALL TIME...this and "What About Bob?"!

    I could not stop laughing even hours later the movie was over. The natural innocence and ignorance (also a touch of genius) Harland Williams has shown in his character was simply superb. The movie has tons of jokes thrown at you and you simply cannot resist them. You have to be a little patient at the start of the movie. The reason for this is after seeing Harland william's Charlie Chaplin type acts at the start, you think it is going to be just another comedy movie. But then, when he gets a chance to be an astronaut you get a felling of "taken inside" the movie without your consciousness. The monkey and Harland Williams seat interchange inside the rocket and what all happens after that till the rocket lands is the ultimate comedy to relish. The climax too was a nerve wracking finish. It takes you to the edge of the seat when Harland just gets it right in taking the rocket back to the track thus avoiding a crash. The best thing is what he uses to fill in the gap for a missing wire. On a whole till date this is the Best Comedy movie i have ever seen in my life.

The best thing is what he uses to fill in the gap for a missing wire. On a whole till date this is the Best Comedy movie i have ever seen in my life.

    Awesome movie. It's a Disney movie so it's got all the rough edges smoothed down, the level of 'offensive' has been completely focus group polished out of it. The closest we get is one of the movies flattest jokes about flatulence in space. Despite this, it has aged very well and remains one of the absolute best quotable funny movies ever made. This is chiefly due to the charisma of the lead character, a Poindexter computer scientist cum everyman who somehow manages to not only become an astronaut candidate but also ends up on a flight mission to Mars. Parts of this were filmed at Johnson Space Center and for the time is reasonably realistic to the look and work. I've got a friend who was an uncredited extra in this and according to him they used a lot of NASA engineers as extras too. If you like slapstick and absurd comedy it is hard to do better than this, and the bonus is you can watch it with your kids. Highly recommended for fans of off kilter absurdness. There are some low points, such as the pointless (yet still funny) shoehorned romance, and the complete waste of Beau Bridges and William Sadler who both play it straight. This is not an ensemble movie, it is nearly completely driven by the comedy timing and dialog of Harland Williams. This movie desperately needs the full BluRay treatment with commentary from all the principles.

    Fred Z. Randall is a geeky spacecraft designer, who gets the chance to make his dream come true. Travel to Mars as a member of the first manned flight there.... Liking this film really depends on whether or not you like the main star, Harland Williams. Here in the UK, he's only really famous for his scene in Dumb and Dumber, and everything else he's done non-Farrelly, has gone straight to DVD and disappeared without a trace. What appealed to me about this movie, and you will know where I am coming from if you've read my other reviews, is that its one of those films from the late nineties that were rife and were released almost every other week. Comedies that shouldn't be good, but for some reason, you seem to have some endearment for them. Carpool, Gone Fishin', Most Wanted, the list is endless, and the films are as watchable as ever. It's a straight forward movie, silly geek gets a job that is over his head, every one hates him and takes liberties to begin with, but come the end, he's the hero and he falls in love. It's straight forward silly stuff, with a few laughs that you can switch your brain off to for ninety or so minutes. If you haven't seen it and like this sort of movies, catch it, its quite funny

    Rocketman is amazingly funny - a top favorite comedy of mine, especially in the underrated category. I put two other movies along side this one in this category - Down Periscope, with Kelsey Grammar and, once again, Harland Williams, and Bushwacked with Daniel Stern (City Slickers). These 3 movies are simply hilarious and are excellent selections to play for others, since they probably haven't seen them, and they're perfect for playing when families are over, because the kids and the adults all enjoy them. Harland Williams is a phenomenal actor and is a perfect fit for his role in this movie - his only starring role in a movie, I believe. It's such a shame that he hasn't starred in more movies and that he's been in so many duds. It seems like he has become a solid bit-part actor, which is such a waste of his talent. He was excellent in Down Periscope, where he made sounds like a whale. His facial expressions and ability to make odd sounds are simply amazing. Rocketman has a superb cast and many memorable parts and lines. I especially like the opening segment where Kelsey Grammar is teeing off, and the fart segment, which I know is the tried and true crude humor attempt, but it just works - even better than the famous fart segment of The Nutty Professor! The love story is very nice and the "Wish Upon a Star" song is a real Disney moment. This is an excellent family Great film!

    Hilarious. I've always felt that 'Rocketman' was one of Disney's best and most under-appreciated live-action films of the last thirty years. It has so many elements of the traditional formula that makes it so Disney, as a die-hard fan, I find it hard to resist. This film is a homage to so much of what Disney loved. It really is a reference to the innovative 'Man in Space' series from the 1950's 'Wonderful World of Disney', and from movies like Disney's 60's comedy 'Moon Pilot'. Not to mention the references to Pinocchio. Harland Williams is not exactly the type of comedian you would expect to see in a family comedy, but then again, neither is Eddie Murphy or even, say Buddy Hackett, for that matter. All of those comics have a pretty raunchy sense of humour outside of their Disney films. I've seen William's stand up humour outside of 'Rocketman', and it is pretty vulgar and college. In this Disney film it is completely wholesome and harmless with perhaps the exception of a scene that features drunkenness. The only thing that may possibly offend is the reference to evolution at the expense of Michelangelo and the Vatican ceiling. But hey. Disney himself was a devout Christian who didn't bother to question science. Very few people did in the 50's. Ever been to a Disney park and seen the different stages of man in evolution? I have. Seen 'Spaceship Earth'? I have. Need I go on? I bet you wish I wouldn't. Look it's not our fault yall wanna start all over again. This might just well prove to be the funniest if not the most controversial film experience of the twentieth century next to '2001: A Space Odyssey'. Anyway you feel on the subject of evolution, this film will blow your roof and rocket you to Mars and beyond.

    Slapstick run amok is about the closest that human speech can come to describing this movie. As it careens in random directions, you scratch your head trying to figure out what's going on, and wondering if you missed something. It's worth a laugh, at least on the level of laughing at how amateurish and childish it is. The Pee Wee Herman look-alike act-alike screaming with that exaggerated shrill voice at cover-the-ears intensity reaches the pain threshold at times. His acting is fine, but the director has him going over the top way too often. At anything. Every scene. Here's the deal: a bumbling but gifted computer geek gets tapped to be on the first manned landing on Mars. Don't ask. With two other people and a chimp (no, really). The chimp mugs, and so does quasi-Pee-Wee. When he's not screeching that is. Pee Wee from the Mars lander gets the whole world to sing campfire songs: I'm surprised somebody didn't just shoot him down. More goofy stuff happens on the voyage, each joke dumber than the last. The likable cast makes the most of the low-brow material. This one's only popcorn filler stuff, though.

    Okay, It's been 12 years since this movie came out. I was 4 when it was released. I first saw it on Disney Channel, and after that...I STILL CANT GET THE IMAGE OF HARLAND SCREAMING IN PAIN WHEN THE CHIMP BITES HIM! Rolling around in that office with the clearly stuffed monkey. In a regular movie this would be seen as cheesy and childish. OH NOT ROCKETMAN SIR, NO NOT THIS. I have seen a lot of Harland Williams movies: his older ones: Dumb and Dumber(C'mon give it here you pumpkin pie haircutted freak!) Half Baked(Oh you like popcorn don't'ya?Makes your teeth go,POPPOPaPOP!) even his creepier but funny uncredited role in Something About Mary (Why do 8 minute abs when there's 6 minute abs?!) Rocketman(Commander are you sure were heading towards planet earth it looks a lot like the sun! Don't question my authority you incompetent fool!AGAAHhhhhhaahahaha..mornin!) And of course Freddy got Fingered (his scream alone is hilarious: AAAAHUeueee!!!AAAAAHueeee!!!HEEEHAhhHEEHAahhAAAAAHuee!!!) Even his newer stuff Employee of the Month and hes got his new sketch movie Child wild But I think Rocketman is him at his best!

    I have no idea why this movie got so many bad reviews, it is awesome. I can't think of a single movie that made me laugh harder. I saw Rocketman in theaters back in the mid-90's, I laughed so hard I literally fell out of my seat. Harland Willims is seriously underrated. Just the part where he has to connect his space suite to William Sadlers (another excellent actor), makes the movie worth watching. Overall, I say this is one of the best Disney movies to come out in the 1990's. It's clean enough for the whole family to watch and is entertaining to both adults and children. 10 out of 10

    You just can't help but love this movie if there is even a little kid left in you at all. Yes a lot of the humor is juvenile but it still is just plain fun all around. Whenever I just want to sit and laugh and forget the stress in my life this is the movie I pop in. Do yourself a favor and indulge in a little low brow humor once in awhile. The entire cast is perfect for this film even the monkey just fits perfect. I don't understand the few negative reviews left for rocket man. You have to have no sense of humor what so ever. If all you like is high brow intellectual indie films then why did you watch this movie in the first place. It is a pure good natured funny fest.

    When I first saw this movie there were times I was laughing so much and so hard that I had trouble catching my breath! Sometimes ya need an ultra-slapstick, goofy movie to dump the weight of the world right off your shoulders and this movie did it for me. Harland Williams is a comic actor genius. HA! The film is a sensational rarity where kids and adults can just be total laughing fools at Williams' antics in this comic "masterpiece of resistance." Lordy, right from the beginning, clear through to the end, the impressive comic craft work, hilarious jokes and physical comedy does not let up. Harland Williams is, without doubt, one of THE most funny actors in the business and I wish that we could all see him in more films. The cool thing about this film is that it sure spits in the eye of all of the pretentious movie snobs who would look down on this film labeling it "unsophisticated, sophomoric" base humor...in reality, this work shows all of us where REAL comedy can take us...like on a ride that is just as thrilling as any hyped up amusement park roller coaster! A GREAT MOVIE FOR ALL TIME...this and "What About Bob?"!

    I could not stop laughing even hours later the movie was over. The natural innocence and ignorance (also a touch of genius) Harland Williams has shown in his character was simply superb. The movie has tons of jokes thrown at you and you simply cannot resist them. You have to be a little patient at the start of the movie. The reason for this is after seeing Harland william's Charlie Chaplin type acts at the start, you think it is going to be just another comedy movie. But then, when he gets a chance to be an astronaut you get a felling of "taken inside" the movie without your consciousness. The monkey and Harland Williams seat interchange inside the rocket and what all happens after that till the rocket lands is the ultimate comedy to relish. The climax too was a nerve wracking finish.

This movie desperately needs the full BluRay treatment with commentary from all the principles.

    Fred Z. Randall is a geeky spacecraft designer, who gets the chance to make his dream come true. Travel to Mars as a member of the first manned flight there.... Liking this film really depends on whether or not you like the main star, Harland Williams. Here in the UK, he's only really famous for his scene in Dumb and Dumber, and everything else he's done non-Farrelly, has gone straight to DVD and disappeared without a trace. What appealed to me about this movie, and you will know where I am coming from if you've read my other reviews, is that its one of those films from the late nineties that were rife and were released almost every other week. Comedies that shouldn't be good, but for some reason, you seem to have some endearment for them. Carpool, Gone Fishin', Most Wanted, the list is endless, and the films are as watchable as ever. It's a straight forward movie, silly geek gets a job that is over his head, every one hates him and takes liberties to begin with, but come the end, he's the hero and he falls in love. It's straight forward silly stuff, with a few laughs that you can switch your brain off to for ninety or so minutes. If you haven't seen it and like this sort of movies, catch it, its quite funny

    Rocketman is amazingly funny - a top favorite comedy of mine, especially in the underrated category. I put two other movies along side this one in this category - Down Periscope, with Kelsey Grammar and, once again, Harland Williams, and Bushwacked with Daniel Stern (City Slickers). These 3 movies are simply hilarious and are excellent selections to play for others, since they probably haven't seen them, and they're perfect for playing when families are over, because the kids and the adults all enjoy them. Harland Williams is a phenomenal actor and is a perfect fit for his role in this movie - his only starring role in a movie, I believe. It's such a shame that he hasn't starred in more movies and that he's been in so many duds. It seems like he has become a solid bit-part actor, which is such a waste of his talent. He was excellent in Down Periscope, where he made sounds like a whale. His facial expressions and ability to make odd sounds are simply amazing. Rocketman has a superb cast and many memorable parts and lines. I especially like the opening segment where Kelsey Grammar is teeing off, and the fart segment, which I know is the tried and true crude humor attempt, but it just works - even better than the famous fart segment of The Nutty Professor! The love story is very nice and the "Wish Upon a Star" song is a real Disney moment. This is an excellent family Great film!

    Hilarious. I've always felt that 'Rocketman' was one of Disney's best and most under-appreciated live-action films of the last thirty years. It has so many elements of the traditional formula that makes it so Disney, as a die-hard fan, I find it hard to resist. This film is a homage to so much of what Disney loved. It really is a reference to the innovative 'Man in Space' series from the 1950's 'Wonderful World of Disney', and from movies like Disney's 60's comedy 'Moon Pilot'. Not to mention the references to Pinocchio. Harland Williams is not exactly the type of comedian you would expect to see in a family comedy, but then again, neither is Eddie Murphy or even, say Buddy Hackett, for that matter. All of those comics have a pretty raunchy sense of humour outside of their Disney films. I've seen William's stand up humour outside of 'Rocketman', and it is pretty vulgar and college. In this Disney film it is completely wholesome and harmless with perhaps the exception of a scene that features drunkenness. The only thing that may possibly offend is the reference to evolution at the expense of Michelangelo and the Vatican ceiling. But hey. Disney himself was a devout Christian who didn't bother to question science. Very few people did in the 50's. Ever been to a Disney park and seen the different stages of man in evolution? I have. Seen 'Spaceship Earth'? I have. Need I go on? I bet you wish I wouldn't. Look it's not our fault yall wanna start all over again. This might just well prove to be the funniest if not the most controversial film experience of the twentieth century next to '2001: A Space Odyssey'. Anyway you feel on the subject of evolution, this film will blow your roof and rocket you to Mars and beyond.

    Slapstick run amok is about the closest that human speech can come to describing this movie. As it careens in random directions, you scratch your head trying to figure out what's going on, and wondering if you missed something. It's worth a laugh, at least on the level of laughing at how amateurish and childish it is. The Pee Wee Herman look-alike act-alike screaming with that exaggerated shrill voice at cover-the-ears intensity reaches the pain threshold at times. His acting is fine, but the director has him going over the top way too often. At anything. Every scene. Here's the deal: a bumbling but gifted computer geek gets tapped to be on the first manned landing on Mars. Don't ask. With two other people and a chimp (no, really). The chimp mugs, and so does quasi-Pee-Wee. When he's not screeching that is. Pee Wee from the Mars lander gets the whole world to sing campfire songs: I'm surprised somebody didn't just shoot him down. More goofy stuff happens on the voyage, each joke dumber than the last. The likable cast makes the most of the low-brow material. This one's only popcorn filler stuff, though.

    Okay, It's been 12 years since this movie came out. I was 4 when it was released. I first saw it on Disney Channel, and after that...I STILL CANT GET THE IMAGE OF HARLAND SCREAMING IN PAIN WHEN THE CHIMP BITES HIM! Rolling around in that office with the clearly stuffed monkey. In a regular movie this would be seen as cheesy and childish. OH NOT ROCKETMAN SIR, NO NOT THIS. I have seen a lot of Harland Williams movies: his older ones: Dumb and Dumber(C'mon give it here you pumpkin pie haircutted freak!) Half Baked(Oh you like popcorn don't'ya?Makes your teeth go,POPPOPaPOP!) even his creepier but funny uncredited role in Something About Mary (Why do 8 minute abs when there's 6 minute abs?!) Rocketman(Commander are you sure were heading towards planet earth it looks a lot like the sun! Don't question my authority you incompetent fool!AGAAHhhhhhaahahaha..mornin!) And of course Freddy got Fingered (his scream alone is hilarious: AAAAHUeueee!!!AAAAAHueeee!!!HEEEHAhhHEEHAahhAAAAAHuee!!!) Even his newer stuff Employee of the Month and hes got his new sketch movie Child wild But I think Rocketman is him at his best!

    I have no idea why this movie got so many bad reviews, it is awesome. I can't think of a single movie that made me laugh harder. I saw Rocketman in theaters back in the mid-90's, I laughed so hard I literally fell out of my seat. Harland Willims is seriously underrated. Just the part where he has to connect his space suite to William Sadlers (another excellent actor), makes the movie worth watching. Overall, I say this is one of the best Disney movies to come out in the 1990's. It's clean enough for the whole family to watch and is entertaining to both adults and children. 10 out of 10

    You just can't help but love this movie if there is even a little kid left in you at all. Yes a lot of the humor is juvenile but it still is just plain fun all around. Whenever I just want to sit and laugh and forget the stress in my life this is the movie I pop in. Do yourself a favor and indulge in a little low brow humor once in awhile. The entire cast is perfect for this film even the monkey just fits perfect. I don't understand the few negative reviews left for rocket man. You have to have no sense of humor what so ever. If all you like is high brow intellectual indie films then why did you watch this movie in the first place. It is a pure good natured funny fest.

    When I first saw this movie there were times I was laughing so much and so hard that I had trouble catching my breath! Sometimes ya need an ultra-slapstick, goofy movie to dump the weight of the world right off your shoulders and this movie did it for me. Harland Williams is a comic actor genius. HA! The film is a sensational rarity where kids and adults can just be total laughing fools at Williams' antics in this comic "masterpiece of resistance." Lordy, right from the beginning, clear through to the end, the impressive comic craft work, hilarious jokes and physical comedy does not let up. Harland Williams is, without doubt, one of THE most funny actors in the business and I wish that we could all see him in more films. The cool thing about this film is that it sure spits in the eye of all of the pretentious movie snobs who would look down on this film labeling it "unsophisticated, sophomoric" base humor...in reality, this work shows all of us where REAL comedy can take us...like on a ride that is just as thrilling as any hyped up amusement park roller coaster! A GREAT MOVIE FOR ALL TIME...this and "What About Bob?"!

    I could not stop laughing even hours later the movie was over. The natural innocence and ignorance (also a touch of genius) Harland Williams has shown in his character was simply superb. The movie has tons of jokes thrown at you and you simply cannot resist them. You have to be a little patient at the start of the movie. The reason for this is after seeing Harland william's Charlie Chaplin type acts at the start, you think it is going to be just another comedy movie. But then, when he gets a chance to be an astronaut you get a felling of "taken inside" the movie without your consciousness. The monkey and Harland Williams seat interchange inside the rocket and what all happens after that till the rocket lands is the ultimate comedy to relish. The climax too was a nerve wracking finish. It takes you to the edge of the seat when Harland just gets it right in taking the rocket back to the track thus avoiding a crash. The best thing is what he uses to fill in the gap for a missing wire. On a whole till date this is the Best Comedy movie i have ever seen in my life.

    Awesome movie. It's a Disney movie so it's got all the rough edges smoothed down, the level of 'offensive' has been completely focus group polished out of it. The closest we get is one of the movies flattest jokes about flatulence in space. Despite this, it has aged very well and remains one of the absolute best quotable funny movies ever made. This is chiefly due to the charisma of the lead character, a Poindexter computer scientist cum everyman who somehow manages to not only become an astronaut candidate but also ends up on a flight mission to Mars. Parts of this were filmed at Johnson Space Center and for the time is reasonably realistic to the look and work. I've got a friend who was an uncredited extra in this and according to him they used a lot of NASA engineers as extras too. If you like slapstick and absurd comedy it is hard to do better than this, and the bonus is you can watch it with your kids. Highly recommended for fans of off kilter absurdness. There are some low points, such as the pointless (yet still funny) shoehorned romance, and the complete waste of Beau Bridges and William Sadler who both play it straight. This is not an ensemble movie, it is nearly completely driven by the comedy timing and dialog of Harland Williams.

    Rocketman is amazingly funny - a top favorite comedy of mine, especially in the underrated category. I put two other movies along side this one in this category - Down Periscope, with Kelsey Grammar and, once again, Harland Williams, and Bushwacked with Daniel Stern (City Slickers). These 3 movies are simply hilarious and are excellent selections to play for others, since they probably haven't seen them, and they're perfect for playing when families are over, because the kids and the adults all enjoy them. Harland Williams is a phenomenal actor and is a perfect fit for his role in this movie - his only starring role in a movie, I believe. It's such a shame that he hasn't starred in more movies and that he's been in so many duds. It seems like he has become a solid bit-part actor, which is such a waste of his talent. He was excellent in Down Periscope, where he made sounds like a whale. His facial expressions and ability to make odd sounds are simply amazing. Rocketman has a superb cast and many memorable parts and lines. I especially like the opening segment where Kelsey Grammar is teeing off, and the fart segment, which I know is the tried and true crude humor attempt, but it just works - even better than the famous fart segment of The Nutty Professor! The love story is very nice and the "Wish Upon a Star" song is a real Disney moment. This is an excellent family Great film!

    Hilarious. I've always felt that 'Rocketman' was one of Disney's best and most under-appreciated live-action films of the last thirty years. It has so many elements of the traditional formula that makes it so Disney, as a die-hard fan, I find it hard to resist. This film is a homage to so much of what Disney loved. It really is a reference to the innovative 'Man in Space' series from the 1950's 'Wonderful World of Disney', and from movies like Disney's 60's comedy 'Moon Pilot'. Not to mention the references to Pinocchio. Harland Williams is not exactly the type of comedian you would expect to see in a family comedy, but then again, neither is Eddie Murphy or even, say Buddy Hackett, for that matter. All of those comics have a pretty raunchy sense of humour outside of their Disney films. I've seen William's stand up humour outside of 'Rocketman', and it is pretty vulgar and college. In this Disney film it is completely wholesome and harmless with perhaps the exception of a scene that features drunkenness. The only thing that may possibly offend is the reference to evolution at the expense of Michelangelo and the Vatican ceiling. But hey. Disney himself was a devout Christian who didn't bother to question science. Very few people did in the 50's. Ever been to a Disney park and seen the different stages of man in evolution? I have. Seen 'Spaceship Earth'? I have. Need I go on? I bet you wish I wouldn't. Look it's not our fault yall wanna start all over again. This might just well prove to be the funniest if not the most controversial film experience of the twentieth century next to '2001: A Space Odyssey'. Anyway you feel on the subject of evolution, this film will blow your roof and rocket you to Mars and beyond.

    Slapstick run amok is about the closest that human speech can come to describing this movie. As it careens in random directions, you scratch your head trying to figure out what's going on, and wondering if you missed something. It's worth a laugh, at least on the level of laughing at how amateurish and childish it is. The Pee Wee Herman look-alike act-alike screaming with that exaggerated shrill voice at cover-the-ears intensity reaches the pain threshold at times. His acting is fine, but the director has him going over the top way too often. At anything. Every scene. Here's the deal: a bumbling but gifted computer geek gets tapped to be on the first manned landing on Mars. Don't ask. With two other people and a chimp (no, really). The chimp mugs, and so does quasi-Pee-Wee. When he's not screeching that is. Pee Wee from the Mars lander gets the whole world to sing campfire songs: I'm surprised somebody didn't just shoot him down. More goofy stuff happens on the voyage, each joke dumber than the last. The likable cast makes the most of the low-brow material. This one's only popcorn filler stuff, though.

    Okay, It's been 12 years since this movie came out. I was 4 when it was released. I first saw it on Disney Channel, and after that...I STILL CANT GET THE IMAGE OF HARLAND SCREAMING IN PAIN WHEN THE CHIMP BITES HIM! Rolling around in that office with the clearly stuffed monkey. In a regular movie this would be seen as cheesy and childish. OH NOT ROCKETMAN SIR, NO NOT THIS. I have seen a lot of Harland Williams movies: his older ones: Dumb and Dumber(C'mon give it here you pumpkin pie haircutted freak!) Half Baked(Oh you like popcorn don't'ya?Makes your teeth go,POPPOPaPOP!) even his creepier but funny uncredited role in Something About Mary (Why do 8 minute abs when there's 6 minute abs?!) Rocketman(Commander are you sure were heading towards planet earth it looks a lot like the sun! Don't question my authority you incompetent fool!AGAAHhhhhhaahahaha..mornin!) And of course Freddy got Fingered (his scream alone is hilarious: AAAAHUeueee!!!AAAAAHueeee!!!HEEEHAhhHEEHAahhAAAAAHuee!!!) Even his newer stuff Employee of the Month and hes got his new sketch movie Child wild But I think Rocketman is him at his best!

    I have no idea why this movie got so many bad reviews, it is awesome. I can't think of a single movie that made me laugh harder. I saw Rocketman in theaters back in the mid-90's, I laughed so hard I literally fell out of my seat. Harland Willims is seriously underrated. Just the part where he has to connect his space suite to William Sadlers (another excellent actor), makes the movie worth watching. Overall, I say this is one of the best Disney movies to come out in the 1990's. It's clean enough for the whole family to watch and is entertaining to both adults and children. 10 out of 10

    You just can't help but love this movie if there is even a little kid left in you at all. Yes a lot of the humor is juvenile but it still is just plain fun all around. Whenever I just want to sit and laugh and forget the stress in my life this is the movie I pop in. Do yourself a favor and indulge in a little low brow humor once in awhile. The entire cast is perfect for this film even the monkey just fits perfect. I don't understand the few negative reviews left for rocket man. You have to have no sense of humor what so ever. If all you like is high brow intellectual indie films then why did you watch this movie in the first place. It is a pure good natured funny fest.

    When I first saw this movie there were times I was laughing so much and so hard that I had trouble catching my breath! Sometimes ya need an ultra-slapstick, goofy movie to dump the weight of the world right off your shoulders and this movie did it for me. Harland Williams is a comic actor genius. HA! The film is a sensational rarity where kids and adults can just be total laughing fools at Williams' antics in this comic "masterpiece of resistance." Lordy, right from the beginning, clear through to the end, the impressive comic craft work, hilarious jokes and physical comedy does not let up. Harland Williams is, without doubt, one of THE most funny actors in the business and I wish that we could all see him in more films. The cool thing about this film is that it sure spits in the eye of all of the pretentious movie snobs who would look down on this film labeling it "unsophisticated, sophomoric" base humor...in reality, this work shows all of us where REAL comedy can take us...like on a ride that is just as thrilling as any hyped up amusement park roller coaster! A GREAT MOVIE FOR ALL TIME...this and "What About Bob?"!

    I could not stop laughing even hours later the movie was over. The natural innocence and ignorance (also a touch of genius) Harland Williams has shown in his character was simply superb. The movie has tons of jokes thrown at you and you simply cannot resist them. You have to be a little patient at the start of the movie. The reason for this is after seeing Harland william's Charlie Chaplin type acts at the start, you think it is going to be just another comedy movie. But then, when he gets a chance to be an astronaut you get a felling of "taken inside" the movie without your consciousness. The monkey and Harland Williams seat interchange inside the rocket and what all happens after that till the rocket lands is the ultimate comedy to relish. The climax too was a nerve wracking finish. It takes you to the edge of the seat when Harland just gets it right in taking the rocket back to the track thus avoiding a crash. The best thing is what he uses to fill in the gap for a missing wire. On a whole till date this is the Best Comedy movie i have ever seen in my life.
