    Saw this on the MoMax movie network. The sound and Hi-Def video were excellent, as was the moody trumpet sounds of Terrence Blanchard. Wesley Snipes is Roemello Skuggs. He grew up in Harlem and as a youngster started making runs for the local drug dealer. Over time he got to the point where he himself, along with his brother, became one of the major dealers. But as always happens, either sooner or later, this type of living catches up with you. Friction and killings escalated when another dealer began competing for territory. Meanwhile Roemello for the first time in his life finds a woman he wants to be with. Until then the women always asked him for attention, and he could leave them alone with no problem. But this time was different, he found himself caring to be with her, and thinking about getting out of the drug business, and leaving Harlem for the Carolinas and a picket fence life. None of that came easy, and many close to him died. The film has many unflattering images and language of the underbelly of New York, but I suppose that was the point. Overall a good movie to see, although many times it moved very slowly as certain characters got into long conversations.

    This feature is a grim, violent urban saga of a dysfunctional family that plays out amid the decay and ugliness of Harlem. This storied community, long neglected and portrayed as unredeemable, takes another hit as families disintegrate and drug wars are the order of the day. The film has an odd symmetry in that it opens and closes with scenes of drug overdoses which may explain why two impressionable youngsters who should know better get swallowed up drug distribution activities and violent crime. The movie also shows black men in a very poor light as every single character is flawed beyond measure and not one of them has a single redeeming quality. Besides the self-loathing of Harlem and its residents, the film's parallel theme serves up the familiar race war shoot-outs between black hoodlums and Mafia thugs who are determined to hold on to lucrative drug markets uptown. Wesley Snipes headlines a good cast that is sadly wasted in this picture. Michael Wright is very good as the angry, bitter Raynathan but with films like "Super Fly", "New Jack City" and several other films of this type out there, who needs another one?

    Plot Synopsis Sugar Hill is a 1994 American crime-drama/neo-noir film starring Wesley Snipes and Michael Wright as brothers Roemello and Raynathan Skuggs. The film focuses on the two brothers, who are major drug dealers in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City. I love this movie because it shows the real grit behind a lifestyle that is often glamorized. People look at hustlers and gold-diggers and see the money, cars and jewelry. Rarely do you see the pain that is associated with obtaining those possessions. This movie gives you a small glimpse of what it's really like in the streets.

    but it can't be. It's just not that good. The writing is substandard. And the one thing that stands out is the weepy jazz soundtrack that is intrusive and annoying. The basic plot, how the black drug runners in the ghetto relate to each other and to the Mob, not a bad idea. And the idea that Wesley Snipes gets sick of the whole thing and wants more from life. Not bad. In fact, Snipes is pretty good in the role. Almost everyone else is pretty awful. It's interesting how lacking in interesting this movie is. Not much seems to happen except once in a while a gun goes off. I think "New Jack City" is likely a better call, not nearly as stylish, nor as pretentious, but more solid as a story.

    I have always loved this film and will always love this film till my dying days. It reminds me of a time when Black cinema broke the mold with the stories that were told and how those stories were told. Sugar Hill is a well written and well acted tale film noir drama that never got the respect it truly deserves. Roemello(Wesley Snipes) wants to break free from a world of crime but is constantly dragged back in. He cant live a normal life or have a girlfriend in it because something bad is always happening around him. His brother Raynathan(Michael Wright) is very high-strung and causes some of Roemello's problems plus he has to deal with his drug-addicted father A.R.(Clarence Williams III). Wesley Snipes best performance is Roemello Skuggs. This movie proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that Wesley can act as well as play a serious role. Michael Wright is good as Raynathan even though he can get buckwild at times. Clarence Williams III is excellent as their drug-afflicted father A.R. He was always a great actor that never got enough credit for great roles such as this one, Hoodlum and Deep Cover. Theresa Randle is is pretty good as Roemello's girlfriend Melissa. She is innocent in the sense that she is not numb to death and violence and actually feels pain upon seeing something like for instance a dead body. Melissa is gorgeous as well as likable. There are also some strong performances by Abe Vigoda and Ernie Hudson. I love the setting of the movie as well as the cinematography. Director Leon Ichaso has an eye for scenery and you can see that as you watch this movie. Its a shame that the movie didn't do well and the director never did another movie again. I would have liked to see another movie from him. In short Sugar Hill is an underrated masterpiece. No self-respecting fan of Black Cinema should be without a copy of Sugar Hill. PS: don't allow these trend-following cookie-cutter review writing craven sheep that run amok on IMDb dictate to you what is a good film. As far as they're concerned any film that doesn't make the Top 250 is not worth viewing. The opinions of spineless puppets are absolutely worthless.

    This is an average gangster film, that's overlong and mediocre, with a rather dull story, the performances were very good though. All the characters are interesting, but not much else, and the story just wasn't able to keep me interested for it's over length in 120 minutes,however Wesley Snipes is simply amazing in this, he is the reason that made it bearable for me. I taped this on the Action movie channel, and I must say I was very disappointed after that extremely powerful and disturbing opening, it all goes downhill from there, plus the ending just didn't cut it for me as it was much too silly for my liking. It had a lot of potential however it just didn't reach it and Wesley has done a much better film like this (New Jack City), plus I didn't really care for any of the characters even if they were somewhat interesting. I would only recommend this to Wesley Snipes fans even then as I said rent New Jack City ,and it's decently made but terribly written, plus it's too depressing. This is an average gangster film, that's overlong and mediocre, with a rather dull story, the performances were very good though, worth a watch I suppose but not much more, you can do better. The Direction is OK. Leon Ichaso does an OK job here with decent camera work, good angles however the pace is terribly inconsistent. The Acting is actually very good and that's what it made it bearable even if I didn't like the characters. Wesley Snipes is amazing as always and is amazing here, he is the likable one out of the bunch as you will feel for him to try and lead a non drug related life, I really liked him!. Clarence Williams III is very good as the drug addicted father, I felt sorry for him. Theresa Randle is decent as the love interest and did what she had to do adequately. Michael Wright is very good as the brother, but I didn't care for his character at all. Rest of the cast are fine. Overall worth a watch I suppose but I wouldn't go out of my way to see it. ** out of 5

    "Sugar Hill" tells the story of two Harlem drug-dealing brothers, Romello & Ray Nathan Skuggs, who struggle to stay on top of their chosen profession as well as their relationship with drug-addicted father Arthur Romello Skuggs(Clarence Williams III). Romello realizes that his life has gone in the wrong direction & that he wants out, to honor his deceased mother's wishes for him. Ray Nathan(Michael Wright), heir apparent to the drug ring, wants to get rid of the competition & rule Harlem with his younger brother. Romello(Wesley Snipes), fed up & idealistic, wants out of the drug business & is looking to start over with new girlfriend Melissa(Theresa Randle). Scared of becoming a target, Melissa wants nothing to do with Romello who convinces her to leave with him. Romello tries to bring together a bitter Ray Nathan & strung-out druggie Arthur to no avail. Romello forgave his father for the past & desires Ray Nathan to reconcile before its too late. Ray Nathan is still angry with his father for the death of junkie mother Ella Skuggs. Romello finally convinces Melissa to be with him & leave to begin a new life together. Romello wants only to take Ray Nathan, Arthur, Melissa & himself back to the South to start over & away from the drug & street life. The problem: Gus(Abe Vigoda), an old Italian drug lord & Lolly(Ernie Hudson), new drug dealer & ex boxing champ, want the brothers out of the way as well as their territories in the drug trade. Gus has a history with Arthur Romello & makes Romello aware of it. Gus told Romello that his father killed his brother Sal many years ago. Lolly kills fellow dealer & best friend Ricky Goggles(Steve Harris) as a warning to Romello & Ray Nathan. Ray Nathan in turn murders one of Gus's men. Lolly calls in a hit on Romello but kills a local wannabe gangster Kymie Daniels(Donald Faison). Romello tells Gus he is out of the game & prepares to leave with Melissa. Ray Nathan kills Arthur by giving him a overdosed shot of heroin. Ray next goes to Gus & Lolly to concede but instead kills them in the restaurant. Ray Nathan then runs into Romello & tells him he killed their father. The two argue with Ray Nathan accidentally shooting Romello with Melissa watching in horror. The film ends with Romello sitting in a wheelchair with Melissa & son living in the South, starting life anew. A good film with a very tragic ending. Unbelievable scene where Arthur(Williams III)overdoses while Ray Nathan watches in horror & shame. The realism of Arthur's overdose is unforgettable & wreaks of solid acting talent. This film does little to glorify drug dealers & rightfully so. No Nino Browns to despise this time!! Check it out.

    Wesley Snipes gives a heart felt performance in this movie about two brothers who get involved as young children with the White Mafia. Snipes and Wright truly are opposites in this one, which gives the movie a nice blend pace as you await Wright to snap at any moment. Added in the mix is actress Theresa Randle who does a nice job convincing you there is more to Snipes character than just killing for hire. Interaction between Snipes'character and his father are very well done. Adding a feel of compassion and hate. Wright's character gives this film an extra push in the category of character depth. Best scene: Snipes'character (Romello) tries to have a sit down dinner with his father and brother. Some of the best lines in the film are said in this scene. I recommend this movie it has appeal to a wide audience.

    For those of you who like this film, a little history. I worked on it as the boom operator for the LA part of the shoot (8 weeks out of 11). The shooting script had a linear structure with no flashback, a history of the Skruggs brothers since they were kids. It was re-edited into the flashback structure after a bad test screening. I'm not sure that this was necessarily better, but it enabled Leon Ichaso and the editors to make trims they might not otherwise have been able to make. The rough cut I saw was a much clearer story, but it played a little long. I think if they had stuck with the original it might have been more successful commercially and artistically. The original title of the script was "Skeezer," and we shot it as "Harlem." At one point near the end of shooting there was talk of a tongue-in-cheek "contest" to see who could come up with the best new title.

    A superior Godfather part 3, this story touched me, just like the godfather trilogy it doesn't glorify the life unlike goodfellas makes it interesting, it isn't about masterminding a criminal plot, it looks at the people affected by it negatively, such as the brothers dad who was really a symbol of what the brothers had turned many people into, the little bits that tell us romello is disturbed by this is beautiful, reminds me of requiem for a dream, Romellos character is also one of the most interesting of the genre, a man who is still obviously a hardened gangsta yet still has a distinct human side as witnessed by his killing of one of his best friends murderers, where he states sincerely "im not like m brother" before delivering a fatal gunshot. As for the ending where Michael Wrights character enters the room with gus and the dealer, so troubled and proceeds to waste em both, in my opinion is one of the best scenes i have ever seen. i have only ever this movie once, yet it still strikes me as the best movie out of the 350 or so I've seen including many in the top 250 and i always name it as my favourite, please makers give it a region 2 release so i can once again live this film.

    For those of you who like this film, a little history. I worked on it as the boom operator for the LA part of the shoot (8 weeks out of 11). The shooting script had a linear structure with no flashback, a history of the Skruggs brothers since they were kids. It was re-edited into the flashback structure after a bad test screening. I'm not sure that this was necessarily better, but it enabled Leon Ichaso and the editors to make trims they might not otherwise have been able to make. The rough cut I saw was a much clearer story, but it played a little long. I think if they had stuck with the original it might have been more successful commercially and artistically. The original title of the script was "Skeezer," and we shot it as "Harlem." At one point near the end of shooting there was talk of a tongue-in-cheek "contest" to see who could come up with the best new title.

    A superior Godfather part 3, this story touched me, just like the godfather trilogy it doesn't glorify the life unlike goodfellas makes it interesting, it isn't about masterminding a criminal plot, it looks at the people affected by it negatively, such as the brothers dad who was really a symbol of what the brothers had turned many people into, the little bits that tell us romello is disturbed by this is beautiful, reminds me of requiem for a dream, Romellos character is also one of the most interesting of the genre, a man who is still obviously a hardened gangsta yet still has a distinct human side as witnessed by his killing of one of his best friends murderers, where he states sincerely "im not like m brother" before delivering a fatal gunshot. As for the ending where Michael Wrights character enters the room with gus and the dealer, so troubled and proceeds to waste em both, in my opinion is one of the best scenes i have ever seen. i have only ever this movie once, yet it still strikes me as the best movie out of the 350 or so I've seen including many in the top 250 and i always name it as my favourite, please makers give it a region 2 release so i can once again live this film.

    Saw this on the MoMax movie network. The sound and Hi-Def video were excellent, as was the moody trumpet sounds of Terrence Blanchard. Wesley Snipes is Roemello Skuggs. He grew up in Harlem and as a youngster started making runs for the local drug dealer. Over time he got to the point where he himself, along with his brother, became one of the major dealers. But as always happens, either sooner or later, this type of living catches up with you. Friction and killings escalated when another dealer began competing for territory. Meanwhile Roemello for the first time in his life finds a woman he wants to be with. Until then the women always asked him for attention, and he could leave them alone with no problem. But this time was different, he found himself caring to be with her, and thinking about getting out of the drug business, and leaving Harlem for the Carolinas and a picket fence life. None of that came easy, and many close to him died. The film has many unflattering images and language of the underbelly of New York, but I suppose that was the point. Overall a good movie to see, although many times it moved very slowly as certain characters got into long conversations.

    This feature is a grim, violent urban saga of a dysfunctional family that plays out amid the decay and ugliness of Harlem. This storied community, long neglected and portrayed as unredeemable, takes another hit as families disintegrate and drug wars are the order of the day. The film has an odd symmetry in that it opens and closes with scenes of drug overdoses which may explain why two impressionable youngsters who should know better get swallowed up drug distribution activities and violent crime. The movie also shows black men in a very poor light as every single character is flawed beyond measure and not one of them has a single redeeming quality. Besides the self-loathing of Harlem and its residents, the film's parallel theme serves up the familiar race war shoot-outs between black hoodlums and Mafia thugs who are determined to hold on to lucrative drug markets uptown. Wesley Snipes headlines a good cast that is sadly wasted in this picture. Michael Wright is very good as the angry, bitter Raynathan but with films like "Super Fly", "New Jack City" and several other films of this type out there, who needs another one?

    Plot Synopsis Sugar Hill is a 1994 American crime-drama/neo-noir film starring Wesley Snipes and Michael Wright as brothers Roemello and Raynathan Skuggs. The film focuses on the two brothers, who are major drug dealers in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City. I love this movie because it shows the real grit behind a lifestyle that is often glamorized. People look at hustlers and gold-diggers and see the money, cars and jewelry. Rarely do you see the pain that is associated with obtaining those possessions. This movie gives you a small glimpse of what it's really like in the streets.

    but it can't be. It's just not that good. The writing is substandard. And the one thing that stands out is the weepy jazz soundtrack that is intrusive and annoying. The basic plot, how the black drug runners in the ghetto relate to each other and to the Mob, not a bad idea. And the idea that Wesley Snipes gets sick of the whole thing and wants more from life. Not bad. In fact, Snipes is pretty good in the role. Almost everyone else is pretty awful. It's interesting how lacking in interesting this movie is. Not much seems to happen except once in a while a gun goes off. I think "New Jack City" is likely a better call, not nearly as stylish, nor as pretentious, but more solid as a story.

    I have always loved this film and will always love this film till my dying days. It reminds me of a time when Black cinema broke the mold with the stories that were told and how those stories were told. Sugar Hill is a well written and well acted tale film noir drama that never got the respect it truly deserves. Roemello(Wesley Snipes) wants to break free from a world of crime but is constantly dragged back in. He cant live a normal life or have a girlfriend in it because something bad is always happening around him. His brother Raynathan(Michael Wright) is very high-strung and causes some of Roemello's problems plus he has to deal with his drug-addicted father A.R.(Clarence Williams III). Wesley Snipes best performance is Roemello Skuggs. This movie proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that Wesley can act as well as play a serious role. Michael Wright is good as Raynathan even though he can get buckwild at times. Clarence Williams III is excellent as their drug-afflicted father A.R. He was always a great actor that never got enough credit for great roles such as this one, Hoodlum and Deep Cover. Theresa Randle is is pretty good as Roemello's girlfriend Melissa. She is innocent in the sense that she is not numb to death and violence and actually feels pain upon seeing something like for instance a dead body. Melissa is gorgeous as well as likable. There are also some strong performances by Abe Vigoda and Ernie Hudson. I love the setting of the movie as well as the cinematography. Director Leon Ichaso has an eye for scenery and you can see that as you watch this movie. Its a shame that the movie didn't do well and the director never did another movie again. I would have liked to see another movie from him. In short Sugar Hill is an underrated masterpiece. No self-respecting fan of Black Cinema should be without a copy of Sugar Hill. PS: don't allow these trend-following cookie-cutter review writing craven sheep that run amok on IMDb dictate to you what is a good film. As far as they're concerned any film that doesn't make the Top 250 is not worth viewing. The opinions of spineless puppets are absolutely worthless.

    This is an average gangster film, that's overlong and mediocre, with a rather dull story, the performances were very good though. All the characters are interesting, but not much else, and the story just wasn't able to keep me interested for it's over length in 120 minutes,however Wesley Snipes is simply amazing in this, he is the reason that made it bearable for me. I taped this on the Action movie channel, and I must say I was very disappointed after that extremely powerful and disturbing opening, it all goes downhill from there, plus the ending just didn't cut it for me as it was much too silly for my liking. It had a lot of potential however it just didn't reach it and Wesley has done a much better film like this (New Jack City), plus I didn't really care for any of the characters even if they were somewhat interesting. I would only recommend this to Wesley Snipes fans even then as I said rent New Jack City ,and it's decently made but terribly written, plus it's too depressing. This is an average gangster film, that's overlong and mediocre, with a rather dull story, the performances were very good though, worth a watch I suppose but not much more, you can do better. The Direction is OK. Leon Ichaso does an OK job here with decent camera work, good angles however the pace is terribly inconsistent. The Acting is actually very good and that's what it made it bearable even if I didn't like the characters. Wesley Snipes is amazing as always and is amazing here, he is the likable one out of the bunch as you will feel for him to try and lead a non drug related life, I really liked him!. Clarence Williams III is very good as the drug addicted father, I felt sorry for him. Theresa Randle is decent as the love interest and did what she had to do adequately. Michael Wright is very good as the brother, but I didn't care for his character at all. Rest of the cast are fine. Overall worth a watch I suppose but I wouldn't go out of my way to see it. ** out of 5

    "Sugar Hill" tells the story of two Harlem drug-dealing brothers, Romello & Ray Nathan Skuggs, who struggle to stay on top of their chosen profession as well as their relationship with drug-addicted father Arthur Romello Skuggs(Clarence Williams III). Romello realizes that his life has gone in the wrong direction & that he wants out, to honor his deceased mother's wishes for him. Ray Nathan(Michael Wright), heir apparent to the drug ring, wants to get rid of the competition & rule Harlem with his younger brother. Romello(Wesley Snipes), fed up & idealistic, wants out of the drug business & is looking to start over with new girlfriend Melissa(Theresa Randle). Scared of becoming a target, Melissa wants nothing to do with Romello who convinces her to leave with him. Romello tries to bring together a bitter Ray Nathan & strung-out druggie Arthur to no avail. Romello forgave his father for the past & desires Ray Nathan to reconcile before its too late. Ray Nathan is still angry with his father for the death of junkie mother Ella Skuggs. Romello finally convinces Melissa to be with him & leave to begin a new life together. Romello wants only to take Ray Nathan, Arthur, Melissa & himself back to the South to start over & away from the drug & street life. The problem: Gus(Abe Vigoda), an old Italian drug lord & Lolly(Ernie Hudson), new drug dealer & ex boxing champ, want the brothers out of the way as well as their territories in the drug trade. Gus has a history with Arthur Romello & makes Romello aware of it. Gus told Romello that his father killed his brother Sal many years ago. Lolly kills fellow dealer & best friend Ricky Goggles(Steve Harris) as a warning to Romello & Ray Nathan. Ray Nathan in turn murders one of Gus's men. Lolly calls in a hit on Romello but kills a local wannabe gangster Kymie Daniels(Donald Faison). Romello tells Gus he is out of the game & prepares to leave with Melissa. Ray Nathan kills Arthur by giving him a overdosed shot of heroin. Ray next goes to Gus & Lolly to concede but instead kills them in the restaurant. Ray Nathan then runs into Romello & tells him he killed their father. The two argue with Ray Nathan accidentally shooting Romello with Melissa watching in horror. The film ends with Romello sitting in a wheelchair with Melissa & son living in the South, starting life anew. A good film with a very tragic ending. Unbelievable scene where Arthur(Williams III)overdoses while Ray Nathan watches in horror & shame. The realism of Arthur's overdose is unforgettable & wreaks of solid acting talent. This film does little to glorify drug dealers & rightfully so. No Nino Browns to despise this time!! Check it out.

    Wesley Snipes gives a heart felt performance in this movie about two brothers who get involved as young children with the White Mafia. Snipes and Wright truly are opposites in this one, which gives the movie a nice blend pace as you await Wright to snap at any moment. Added in the mix is actress Theresa Randle who does a nice job convincing you there is more to Snipes character than just killing for hire. Interaction between Snipes'character and his father are very well done. Adding a feel of compassion and hate. Wright's character gives this film an extra push in the category of character depth. Best scene: Snipes'character (Romello) tries to have a sit down dinner with his father and brother. Some of the best lines in the film are said in this scene. I recommend this movie it has appeal to a wide audience.

Snipes and Wright truly are opposites in this one, which gives the movie a nice blend pace as you await Wright to snap at any moment. Added in the mix is actress Theresa Randle who does a nice job convincing you there is more to Snipes character than just killing for hire. Interaction between Snipes'character and his father are very well done. Adding a feel of compassion and hate. Wright's character gives this film an extra push in the category of character depth. Best scene: Snipes'character (Romello) tries to have a sit down dinner with his father and brother. Some of the best lines in the film are said in this scene. I recommend this movie it has appeal to a wide audience.

    For those of you who like this film, a little history. I worked on it as the boom operator for the LA part of the shoot (8 weeks out of 11). The shooting script had a linear structure with no flashback, a history of the Skruggs brothers since they were kids. It was re-edited into the flashback structure after a bad test screening. I'm not sure that this was necessarily better, but it enabled Leon Ichaso and the editors to make trims they might not otherwise have been able to make. The rough cut I saw was a much clearer story, but it played a little long. I think if they had stuck with the original it might have been more successful commercially and artistically. The original title of the script was "Skeezer," and we shot it as "Harlem." At one point near the end of shooting there was talk of a tongue-in-cheek "contest" to see who could come up with the best new title.

    A superior Godfather part 3, this story touched me, just like the godfather trilogy it doesn't glorify the life unlike goodfellas makes it interesting, it isn't about masterminding a criminal plot, it looks at the people affected by it negatively, such as the brothers dad who was really a symbol of what the brothers had turned many people into, the little bits that tell us romello is disturbed by this is beautiful, reminds me of requiem for a dream, Romellos character is also one of the most interesting of the genre, a man who is still obviously a hardened gangsta yet still has a distinct human side as witnessed by his killing of one of his best friends murderers, where he states sincerely "im not like m brother" before delivering a fatal gunshot. As for the ending where Michael Wrights character enters the room with gus and the dealer, so troubled and proceeds to waste em both, in my opinion is one of the best scenes i have ever seen. i have only ever this movie once, yet it still strikes me as the best movie out of the 350 or so I've seen including many in the top 250 and i always name it as my favourite, please makers give it a region 2 release so i can once again live this film.
