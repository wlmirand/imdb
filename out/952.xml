 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Wayne Wang's follow-up movie to Smoke presents a series of improvisational situations strung together to form a pastiche of Brooklyn's diverse ethnicity, offbeat humor, and essential humanity. Many of the same characters inhabiting Auggie Wren's Brooklyn Cigar Store in Smoke return here to expound on their philosophy of smoking, relationships, baseball, New York, and Belgian Waffles. Most of all, this is a movie about living life, off-the-cuff.

    Brooklyn, New York has changed over the last 18 years since this film first premiered. The location near Prospect Park is now one of the most desirable locales to live and reside in the borough and even in New York City. Brooklyn's transformation from a working class borough has changed in some parts. Brooklyn has become hip for the trend setters. It also gentrified in areas especially near the Prospect Park, Brooklyn's Central Park. Still, the film reminds me of another time when Brooklyn wasn't so hip or trendy but real. The people of Brooklyn and New York City like Harvey Keitel, Lou Reed, and others recall their likes and dislikes as well. They spend their time smoking at the Brooklyn Cigar Shop where Augie played by Keitel is the manager but not the owner. The cast includes top notch performers like Lily Tomlin, Lou Reed, Roseanne, Mira Sorvino, etc. A lot of the film's script seems improvised but it makes the film more authentic to documenting the life in a day.

    A companion piece to Smoke rather than a sequel, and as such it works well enough, but the fact that it's made mostly of outtakes and improvisations is easily detectable, and it feels far too disjointed, while still trying rather feebly for a coherent storyline, especially in the epilogue. However, the acting is good enough that many scenes shine through, some of the cameos feel forced but most of them are spot-on (brilliant appearances from Madonna, Roseanne and Jim Jarmusch especially) and it's enjoyable for fans of the original Smoke as well as Jarmusch fans, although all too often it feels like a Jarmusch carbon copy that doesn't have Jim's unique spark and vision.

    definitely worth a watch this movie is about Brooklyn in New york city and people living there. The Story is about a small tobacco shop with interviews of various people living in Brooklyn about Brooklyn. so its almost like a documentary in its own way. It got a good story and lots of tales to tell about people and their lives. Not an action movie more of a calm story type of movie with a lot of talking that gives you a lot of insight into peoples lives in that area and a personal story of the tobacco salesman that works in the shop.

    I have founded this semidocumentary about the Brooklynian way of life from an ordinary man's POV rather amusing and compellingand very sarcastic and mordant; it's studded with vaguely familiar faces (whose identities are mostly unknown to me, as I am not a frequenter of the culture in causethe Jarmusch/ Madonna brands ). The movie is, as I suggested, ironicyet _unconclusively so. It is unassuming, sometimes funny, and Mel Gorham is very sexy. On the other hand, it's not too intense or particularly successful at seizing the hidden life of Brooklyn. It has the intelligent, not really intellectual or particularly inspired look of other similar attemptslike some Mamet outings . It's not insightful or meaningfulbut funny, light, enjoyable. It is also cruel and merciless in exposing empty livespeople to whom the Dodgers' leaving was the most important thing in their lives, etc., insipid, lifeless existences, withered humanity, banal destines soaked in ugliness. This world is wholly alien to me. This Auster intellectuality, like some Mamet mean intellectuality, seems not very far from the W. Allen intellectuality. I guess the film is for the most part ironic; yet if it was meant to convey a certain savor of Brooklyn life, it did not succeedat least with those ignorant of Brooklyn things. The Dodgers and the Belgian waffles are part of that Americana (what Amis once stated as 'too much trolley-car nostalgia and baseball-mitt Americana, too much ancestor worship, too much piety ') that is particularly unattractive to me. In this sociological sense ,the movie describes an utterly uninteresting world and humanity. These things do not seem to me childishbut, on the contrary, senile and boring. These ingredients are particularly repulsive to me. What strikes is the artificiality and shallowness and inner poverty of these clich&eacute;s. Some 60 years ago, some Europeans, many French Europeans hinted this might denote a styleand even be a stylish thing. Maybe they meant different realities, or maybe things changed too much.

    I saw this film twice. As a cinema lover, I perfectly know what Paul Auster and, most of all, the actors, wanted to show in this movie. It's just a global view of Brooklyn: what's good or funny or bad up there. The story is alright. But that's not what disappointed me when I saw it. What really bugged me was the way some characters were depicted. The female characters,for example, ( Violeta !!) are really dire. They are a summation of all "female" defaults: yelling, crying, spoiled, selfish, and so on. What a pity...Though there are some funny scenes, I must admit (especially the shots featuring Lou Reed). There are also pretty great shots showing John Lurie (one of the best actors ever) playing with his jazz band.

    This semi-sequel to "Smoke" continues the adventures of Auggie Wren (Harvey Keitel) and his friends. I thought that the most interesting part was Jim Jarmusch as the man smoking his last cigar. But overall, "Blue in the Face" looks at life in general. Maybe it's not quite as great as the original, but still definitely worth seeing. And I remember when I saw it in the theater that it featured Jerry Garcia's last music video. Really good. All in all, this is another example of how great indie cinema is. Also starring Michael J. Fox, Roseanne, Lily Tomlin, Jared Harris, Giancarlo Esposito, John Lurie and Madonna.

    I don't mind improvisation. In fact, good improvisation is better than actors following a written script. Some of the funniest scenes have benefited from good improvisation. Think of almost any Robin Williams movie. Or, the Billy Crystal scene with Meg Ryan where he has her saying things in a funny voice. Or, how about the team that made such movies as Best in Show and Waiting For Guffman? But this movie, Blue in the Face, just does not come off as good improvisation. It is clear what they are doing, but it comes across as unsure and uneven, and not particularly funny. Interlaced throughout the movie are nondescript people reciting facts about Brooklyn -- how many potholes in the streets, for example. There is a thread of a story. The owner of a cigar shop intends to turn it into a health food store. And, the locals don't approve. There are tense moments when we wonder if the cigar shop will persist. Anyway, it is a movie for certain tastes, it just isn't a movie for my tastes.

    I found 'Blue In The Face' much more enjoyable than 'Smoke': it is funnier and more genuine. Although I must admit that seeing 'Smoke' allowed me to discover Paul Auster's novels, many of which are also set in New York (Personally I would recommend The Invention Of Solitude and Oracle Night). Here are a couple quotes from 'Blue In The Face' that I found hilarious: Lou Reed: Yes, I'm smoking cigarettes and many of my friends have died of it. On the other hand, while I'm smoking cigarettes, I'm not downing a bottle of Scotch in 15 minutes. So looked at from this point of view, it's a health tool. Lou Reed: My childhood was so unpleasant that I don't remember anything I think before age 31.

    Equivalent to a cinematic rendition of an,albeit localised(heh) version of James Joyce's 'Dubliners' insofar as it evokes what to me (a non-Brookliner, in fact a Dubliner) what it might feel like to be 'part of a community'....beautiful at every turn, this masterpiece evokes,simply,the everyday interaction of 'characters'(The evocation helped somewhat by the presence of celebrities; i.e.- individuals that carry a 'Gravitas' and pre-known persona (we imagine) that yet inhabits the space of this wonderfully intimate piece of cinema.It is nice to see players allowed to be themselves, wonderfully devoid of all the usual personal and public affectations,and constraints that inevitably surround them in the context of a mainstream $X million dollar production...and produce something that immerses the viewer in the realm of 'an area'....a locale.....(in this case Brooklyn N.Y.C.)...and allows foreigners,such as myself to indulge myself in 'something' that is both 'known and familiar' and actually unknown.Kietel,Reed,Jarmusch,Malik Yoba,Gorham excel themselves in this epic vignette of real-town life in a place within a place.This could be down-town 'anywhere'.I salute all concerned with realising this refreshing piece of brilliance. -Love David Loughran

    Actors can improvise when a script is provided to build from, but this movie started only with characters and then allowed bad actors, and horrible writers, to deliver off the cuff lines. This is the movie actors do when they want to "really experience their craft". Unfortunately, one learns, without writers, these actors have no craft. The movie is most unfortunate because it followed a very nice movie, "Smoke", and came from a very good write, "Auster". Someone, Auster and Wang most off all, should have finished the movie but then recognize it for what it is, a behind the scenes ego-trip for everyone involved, and just included it as an interesting bit on the Smoke DVD.

    I saw this film twice. As a cinema lover, I perfectly know what Paul Auster and, most of all, the actors, wanted to show in this movie. It's just a global view of Brooklyn: what's good or funny or bad up there. The story is alright. But that's not what disappointed me when I saw it. What really bugged me was the way some characters were depicted. The female characters,for example, ( Violeta !!) are really dire. They are a summation of all "female" defaults: yelling, crying, spoiled, selfish, and so on. What a pity...Though there are some funny scenes, I must admit (especially the shots featuring Lou Reed). There are also pretty great shots showing John Lurie (one of the best actors ever) playing with his jazz band.

    This semi-sequel to "Smoke" continues the adventures of Auggie Wren (Harvey Keitel) and his friends. I thought that the most interesting part was Jim Jarmusch as the man smoking his last cigar. But overall, "Blue in the Face" looks at life in general. Maybe it's not quite as great as the original, but still definitely worth seeing. And I remember when I saw it in the theater that it featured Jerry Garcia's last music video. Really good. All in all, this is another example of how great indie cinema is. Also starring Michael J. Fox, Roseanne, Lily Tomlin, Jared Harris, Giancarlo Esposito, John Lurie and Madonna.

    I found 'Blue In The Face' much more enjoyable than 'Smoke': it is funnier and more genuine. Although I must admit that seeing 'Smoke' allowed me to discover Paul Auster's novels, many of which are also set in New York (Personally I would recommend The Invention Of Solitude and Oracle Night). Here are a couple quotes from 'Blue In The Face' that I found hilarious: Lou Reed: Yes, I'm smoking cigarettes and many of my friends have died of it. On the other hand, while I'm smoking cigarettes, I'm not downing a bottle of Scotch in 15 minutes. So looked at from this point of view, it's a health tool. Lou Reed: My childhood was so unpleasant that I don't remember anything I think before age 31.

    Equivalent to a cinematic rendition of an,albeit localised(heh) version of James Joyce's 'Dubliners' insofar as it evokes what to me (a non-Brookliner, in fact a Dubliner) what it might feel like to be 'part of a community'....beautiful at every turn, this masterpiece evokes,simply,the everyday interaction of 'characters'(The evocation helped somewhat by the presence of celebrities; i.e.- individuals that carry a 'Gravitas' and pre-known persona (we imagine) that yet inhabits the space of this wonderfully intimate piece of cinema.It is nice to see players allowed to be themselves, wonderfully devoid of all the usual personal and public affectations,and constraints that inevitably surround them in the context of a mainstream $X million dollar production...and produce something that immerses the viewer in the realm of 'an area'....a locale.....(in this case Brooklyn N.Y.C.)...and allows foreigners,such as myself to indulge myself in 'something' that is both 'known and familiar' and actually unknown.Kietel,Reed,Jarmusch,Malik Yoba,Gorham excel themselves in this epic vignette of real-town life in a place within a place.This could be down-town 'anywhere'.I salute all concerned with realising this refreshing piece of brilliance. -Love David Loughran

    Actors can improvise when a script is provided to build from, but this movie started only with characters and then allowed bad actors, and horrible writers, to deliver off the cuff lines. This is the movie actors do when they want to "really experience their craft". Unfortunately, one learns, without writers, these actors have no craft. The movie is most unfortunate because it followed a very nice movie, "Smoke", and came from a very good write, "Auster". Someone, Auster and Wang most off all, should have finished the movie but then recognize it for what it is, a behind the scenes ego-trip for everyone involved, and just included it as an interesting bit on the Smoke DVD.

    Brooklyn, New York has changed over the last 18 years since this film first premiered. The location near Prospect Park is now one of the most desirable locales to live and reside in the borough and even in New York City. Brooklyn's transformation from a working class borough has changed in some parts. Brooklyn has become hip for the trend setters. It also gentrified in areas especially near the Prospect Park, Brooklyn's Central Park. Still, the film reminds me of another time when Brooklyn wasn't so hip or trendy but real. The people of Brooklyn and New York City like Harvey Keitel, Lou Reed, and others recall their likes and dislikes as well. They spend their time smoking at the Brooklyn Cigar Shop where Augie played by Keitel is the manager but not the owner. The cast includes top notch performers like Lily Tomlin, Lou Reed, Roseanne, Mira Sorvino, etc. A lot of the film's script seems improvised but it makes the film more authentic to documenting the life in a day.

    A companion piece to Smoke rather than a sequel, and as such it works well enough, but the fact that it's made mostly of outtakes and improvisations is easily detectable, and it feels far too disjointed, while still trying rather feebly for a coherent storyline, especially in the epilogue. However, the acting is good enough that many scenes shine through, some of the cameos feel forced but most of them are spot-on (brilliant appearances from Madonna, Roseanne and Jim Jarmusch especially) and it's enjoyable for fans of the original Smoke as well as Jarmusch fans, although all too often it feels like a Jarmusch carbon copy that doesn't have Jim's unique spark and vision.

    definitely worth a watch this movie is about Brooklyn in New york city and people living there. The Story is about a small tobacco shop with interviews of various people living in Brooklyn about Brooklyn. so its almost like a documentary in its own way. It got a good story and lots of tales to tell about people and their lives. Not an action movie more of a calm story type of movie with a lot of talking that gives you a lot of insight into peoples lives in that area and a personal story of the tobacco salesman that works in the shop.

    I have founded this semidocumentary about the Brooklynian way of life from an ordinary man's POV rather amusing and compellingand very sarcastic and mordant; it's studded with vaguely familiar faces (whose identities are mostly unknown to me, as I am not a frequenter of the culture in causethe Jarmusch/ Madonna brands ). The movie is, as I suggested, ironicyet _unconclusively so. It is unassuming, sometimes funny, and Mel Gorham is very sexy. On the other hand, it's not too intense or particularly successful at seizing the hidden life of Brooklyn. It has the intelligent, not really intellectual or particularly inspired look of other similar attemptslike some Mamet outings . It's not insightful or meaningfulbut funny, light, enjoyable. It is also cruel and merciless in exposing empty livespeople to whom the Dodgers' leaving was the most important thing in their lives, etc., insipid, lifeless existences, withered humanity, banal destines soaked in ugliness. This world is wholly alien to me. This Auster intellectuality, like some Mamet mean intellectuality, seems not very far from the W. Allen intellectuality. I guess the film is for the most part ironic; yet if it was meant to convey a certain savor of Brooklyn life, it did not succeedat least with those ignorant of Brooklyn things. The Dodgers and the Belgian waffles are part of that Americana (what Amis once stated as 'too much trolley-car nostalgia and baseball-mitt Americana, too much ancestor worship, too much piety ') that is particularly unattractive to me. In this sociological sense ,the movie describes an utterly uninteresting world and humanity. These things do not seem to me childishbut, on the contrary, senile and boring. These ingredients are particularly repulsive to me. What strikes is the artificiality and shallowness and inner poverty of these clich&eacute;s. Some 60 years ago, some Europeans, many French Europeans hinted this might denote a styleand even be a stylish thing. Maybe they meant different realities, or maybe things changed too much.

    Equivalent to a cinematic rendition of an,albeit localised(heh) version of James Joyce's 'Dubliners' insofar as it evokes what to me (a non-Brookliner, in fact a Dubliner) what it might feel like to be 'part of a community'....beautiful at every turn, this masterpiece evokes,simply,the everyday interaction of 'characters'(The evocation helped somewhat by the presence of celebrities; i.e.- individuals that carry a 'Gravitas' and pre-known persona (we imagine) that yet inhabits the space of this wonderfully intimate piece of cinema.It is nice to see players allowed to be themselves, wonderfully devoid of all the usual personal and public affectations,and constraints that inevitably surround them in the context of a mainstream $X million dollar production...and produce something that immerses the viewer in the realm of 'an area'....a locale.....(in this case Brooklyn N.Y.C.)...and allows foreigners,such as myself to indulge myself in 'something' that is both 'known and familiar' and actually unknown.Kietel,Reed,Jarmusch,Malik Yoba,Gorham excel themselves in this epic vignette of real-town life in a place within a place.This could be down-town 'anywhere'.I salute all concerned with realising this refreshing piece of brilliance. -Love David Loughran

    Actors can improvise when a script is provided to build from, but this movie started only with characters and then allowed bad actors, and horrible writers, to deliver off the cuff lines. This is the movie actors do when they want to "really experience their craft". Unfortunately, one learns, without writers, these actors have no craft. The movie is most unfortunate because it followed a very nice movie, "Smoke", and came from a very good write, "Auster". Someone, Auster and Wang most off all, should have finished the movie but then recognize it for what it is, a behind the scenes ego-trip for everyone involved, and just included it as an interesting bit on the Smoke DVD.
