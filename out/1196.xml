    "The Savage Nights" is an adaptation of Cyril Collard's semi-autobiographical novel "Les Nuits Fauves", published in 1989.The Brutal honesty is one of the most commendable aspects of this film. ... i mean don't we all try to hide our faults and flaws just so we can be socially acceptable ... while this one character comes out and bares his soul to the world.Collard plays himself in the movie which perhaps enlivens the struggles of the character with his bisexuality , his illness(AIDS) that was a new phenomenon in that era with the knowledge about it scares and a young mans acceptance to his situation.Bravery not always means going with arms against an enemy sometimes it's just telling the truth that is the bravest and most noblest of deeds ,Cyril Collard didn't try to camouflage anything the sheer courage behind this movie is what brings me to tears.His cry in the movie "i want to live" is unforgettable and literally breaks my heart.

    "Les nuits fauves" is one of the most honest films I have ever seen about human condition and one of the aspects of our sexuality. For a start, the depiction of ambisexuality is quite sincere, showing the suffering this ambiguous sexual behavior (considered an orientation, in spite of its apparent lack of direction) brings to people really involved or in love with the so-called bisexual entity who feels attracted to both men and women. The motion picture is not fiction or a bad joke, but mainly facts based on Cyril Collard's own life, who infected the woman he was involved with (played here by Romane Bohringer), knowing he was HIV-positive. First came the revelation through the novel of the same title, and then the film, in which he played his own part because no French actor even considered to play it, finding it too risky for their careers. Collard plays himself apparently as he was: a vain, irresponsible, hedonistic strong case of satyriasis (the male counterpart for female erotic mania), and thanks for his daring to show his lifestyle, his passions and his mistakes, at least he left a starting point for open-minded partners to discuss a subject that may be affecting their relationships. It is a film as hard and bleak as Wong Kar-Wai's "Happy Together", but both are necessary. There is time for "To Wong Foo" and for "Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"; there is even time for explicitness. But there should be also time for putting moralistic judgment aside, and watch and talk about dramas that show aspects of our condition that we tend to trivialize or deny, and that may make unhappy the persons we love. Five days after Cyril Collard died, "Les nuits fauves" won the C&eacute;sar (France's top film prize) for Best Film, Best First Work, Best Film Editing and Best Female Newcomer (Miss Bohringer, who three years later played again the "victim" of two men in love: Leonardo DiCaprio and David Thewlis, as Rimbaud and Verlaine, in Total Eclipse). Collard's motion picture also won the Audience Award, the International Film Critics Prize and the Special Jury Prize at the Festival of Young Cinema, in Torino, Italy.

    even when facing death, the guy (Cyril Collard) never considered to repent. generally speaking, the movie is about the so called "open relationship" a guy sleeps with another guy, then, sleeps with that guy's girlfriend, then, with the girlfriend's girlfriend(roommate). etc just like most french movies of the genre, there is nothing new. the guy who was like that deserved a totally good riddance..worthless and ruinful in the world..so being rotten in hell might be hopeful. since IMDb is happy at deleting my sincere reviews(against their radical leftist world view and true nature).well, that's enough for this one. amen

    This film was a succ&egrave;s de scandale when it was released twenty years ago, and although (in Europe and America) HIV is not the death sentence that it was at the time, the film still packs an emotional wallop. It is the portrait of a completely self-centered man who is willing to put others at risk in search of his own pleasure and self-actualization. Is he a despicable character? Yes. Does that mean the film is automatically bad? No,however... The film contains too many unfocused scenes of characters lashing out. By the fourth or fifth scene of the young female protagonist screaming on the phone, screaming in the street, screaming at the door of the apartment, it becomes overdetermined. The film tries to tackle too many subjects--sadomasochism, skinheads, internalized homophobia, bisexuality, AIDS and responsibility, teenage love... it ends up something of a hot mess. I gave it six out of ten because I feel that it is worth seeing, because it captures a certain zeitgeist of the pre-antiretroviral moment, but one does feel a bit on watching it today that it has not aged all that well.

    Terrible, meaningless French film with trademark French characters who are totally unlikeable and completely self centred. Plot deals with a very heavy, multi-layered subject - that of AIDS and bi-sexual relationships - yet fails entirely in its attempt to do anything with it. The whole movie is almost like a lame excuse for controversial sex scenes, though this is nothing new to the French. The reasonably strong performances from the lead players can do nothing to redeem their ugly roles and the nonsense which one might otherwise call a storyline. "Savage Nights" never stood a chance! This is such a bad movie its just plain frustrating trying to sift through the mess, confusion and loathsome people to find a reason why? Why?!! All controversy and no idea! Just downright awful! When you tell a story, have a point. Friday, September 15, 1995 - Astor Theatre

    Difficult for me to understand that this movie got a Cesar and even worse that viewers would like it. Sick people can be found in any race, religion, gender or sexual orientation. True enough, numerous movies will explore the black side of humanity and some are remarkable pieces of art. When it comes to sexuality, the subject is more delicate and requires a lot of intelligence from the part of the director to get the message, if any, across. In Les Nuits Fauves, I believe the border is crossed by showing devious animal behavior attached to the main character, a bisexual gay. And this is not what homosexuality is about. Garbage is the only word which comes to my mind, but again, others may have a different opinion.

    ...but pictures a completely different perspective on HIV and AIDS. No supportive family here. No struggle with society for it to acknowledge on our humanity, regardless of sexual preference or health status. This picture is an invaluable reference for all those trying to understand terminal disease -AIDS in particular- or in the process of facing death. Just seems important to mention that Collard's actual treatments were filmed and included on the final cut. The bouncing around of high-low's, from absolute certainty of overcoming the disease to deep depression and sending everything -love included- straight to hell. But also the dangerous and sometimes silly sense of humor with which the director plays his role, is what makes this movie invaluable to me. To my knowledge this is the first film in which HIV positive blood is used as a defensive weapon, and saves the life of two of the characters. I sincerely hope that there is some form of afterlife, and that they have cable. Collard deserves to know he was, is, deeply appreciated, as so many others who where "cheated" out of time, to see their work achieve recognition. One is what one does, they say.

    The movie is a classical tragedy. The star, writer, director Cyril Collard has Aids and knows he is dying when making the film. He storms and rages against the forces of negativity and affirms life in ways that seem obscene to many, but really focus on the basics of life, love and the willingness to actually live your life, even knowing that you are about to die. To quote Dylan Thomas, "He rages against the dying of the night." This is not a gloomy film, except for the immense talent that Collard has in a number of areas, not the least writing and directing. The tragedy is that his libertine life of reckless homosexuality killed him (and many others). Unlike Philadelphia, an artifice of politically correct, maudlin nonsense, this film has Aids sometimes right in your face and sometimes in the background, but it is always there. Hedonism killed many and still does in the Aids epidemic and in the U.S.A., this film would attract few positive reviews and almost no distribution because Collard refuses to play the victim game. Over 80% of Aids deaths have been caused by homosexual behavior. In the film Collard can't control his impulses and because of Aids he wants to squeeze as much out of life as he can. The love story with Laura, beautifully played by Romane Bohringer, is tragic in and of itself, but their love is fatally compromised by his disease. Collard desperately wanted to live his life with Aids and not have Aids run his life. Unfortunately, that is impossible, although he gives it a mighty effort to free himself from thoughts of death, which never really leave him. He continues to have grimy homosexual encounters, supposedly not involving dangerous sex (at least in the film); my surmise is that in real life he lived dangerously right up to the end. When he has sex with Laura the first time, he doesn't use a condom and doesn't tell her he has Aids--a classic kind of denial, an attempt to conquer the disease through action , which is selfish. Many homosexuals will see this film, which other scenes do not really show them in a positive light, as a film to suppress. Reckless behavior has volcanoed in the last few years, but gets no publicity because of the left-wing press who refuses to see Aids victims as anything but victims, who didn't really cause their disease. Collard's film slaps the faces of hypocrisy and lying about Aids again and again in this film. It is a testimony to his will to live and to make a film that doesn't cover up the reality of how Aids is spread and how little impulse control many gays have. Drugs will not stop Aids deaths, safe sex and sometimes no sex will. Also, and very important, Collard wants to show that the heterosexual relationship with a loving woman is the way to live your life, but for him his refusal to control his impulses and perhaps his genetic inability to control them (though that is difficult to infer), keeps him from what would have saved him. Hedonism is not spat on in this movie, but its terrible results in many cases are exemplified in the tragic death of such a talented and lovely man.

    Les Nuits Fauves/savage nights: for those of you who are maybe not accustomed to watching world cinema, i wouldn't advise you view this as your first taster! Most of you who have an A-level in French may know this one......Although far from a pleasant plot, the film's excellent cinematography and use of rich, vivid dream sequences, more than makes up for the lack of inter-character development. What makes this film more tragic is the fact that its main star (and director)also a bisexual 'free spirit', had a somewhat similar end to his life, dying from an HIV related illness just one year after the movie was released. i think this adds to the whole feeling of the film - as you watch his respective lovers (one male, one a teenage girl) desperately try to hold his admiration and attention, you almost forget that the main character himself is trying to come to terms with his own eventual demise. although a serious subject, the carefree attitude of the main man leaves a sense of Hope.

    One of the best early films to deal with AIDs and the powerful feelings that come up when one has to deal with it. The acting and the passion of the roles by the actors is very good, very intense. The love for life that comes through in the desperation of the main characters is beautiful. Lots of frustration and anger about having AIDs but ultimately the choice to fight to live comes through and this film was much ahead of it's American counterparts for the time. Most of the contemporary films in America were about the death and dying of people with Aids not the struggle to go on living and that's what sets this film apart from the others of it's time. Highly recommended!!

Highly recommended!!

    "The Savage Nights" is an adaptation of Cyril Collard's semi-autobiographical novel "Les Nuits Fauves", published in 1989.The Brutal honesty is one of the most commendable aspects of this film. ... i mean don't we all try to hide our faults and flaws just so we can be socially acceptable ... while this one character comes out and bares his soul to the world.Collard plays himself in the movie which perhaps enlivens the struggles of the character with his bisexuality , his illness(AIDS) that was a new phenomenon in that era with the knowledge about it scares and a young mans acceptance to his situation.Bravery not always means going with arms against an enemy sometimes it's just telling the truth that is the bravest and most noblest of deeds ,Cyril Collard didn't try to camouflage anything the sheer courage behind this movie is what brings me to tears.His cry in the movie "i want to live" is unforgettable and literally breaks my heart.

    "Les nuits fauves" is one of the most honest films I have ever seen about human condition and one of the aspects of our sexuality. For a start, the depiction of ambisexuality is quite sincere, showing the suffering this ambiguous sexual behavior (considered an orientation, in spite of its apparent lack of direction) brings to people really involved or in love with the so-called bisexual entity who feels attracted to both men and women. The motion picture is not fiction or a bad joke, but mainly facts based on Cyril Collard's own life, who infected the woman he was involved with (played here by Romane Bohringer), knowing he was HIV-positive. First came the revelation through the novel of the same title, and then the film, in which he played his own part because no French actor even considered to play it, finding it too risky for their careers. Collard plays himself apparently as he was: a vain, irresponsible, hedonistic strong case of satyriasis (the male counterpart for female erotic mania), and thanks for his daring to show his lifestyle, his passions and his mistakes, at least he left a starting point for open-minded partners to discuss a subject that may be affecting their relationships. It is a film as hard and bleak as Wong Kar-Wai's "Happy Together", but both are necessary. There is time for "To Wong Foo" and for "Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"; there is even time for explicitness. But there should be also time for putting moralistic judgment aside, and watch and talk about dramas that show aspects of our condition that we tend to trivialize or deny, and that may make unhappy the persons we love. Five days after Cyril Collard died, "Les nuits fauves" won the C&eacute;sar (France's top film prize) for Best Film, Best First Work, Best Film Editing and Best Female Newcomer (Miss Bohringer, who three years later played again the "victim" of two men in love: Leonardo DiCaprio and David Thewlis, as Rimbaud and Verlaine, in Total Eclipse). Collard's motion picture also won the Audience Award, the International Film Critics Prize and the Special Jury Prize at the Festival of Young Cinema, in Torino, Italy.

    even when facing death, the guy (Cyril Collard) never considered to repent. generally speaking, the movie is about the so called "open relationship" a guy sleeps with another guy, then, sleeps with that guy's girlfriend, then, with the girlfriend's girlfriend(roommate). etc just like most french movies of the genre, there is nothing new. the guy who was like that deserved a totally good riddance..worthless and ruinful in the world..so being rotten in hell might be hopeful. since IMDb is happy at deleting my sincere reviews(against their radical leftist world view and true nature).well, that's enough for this one. amen

    This film was a succ&egrave;s de scandale when it was released twenty years ago, and although (in Europe and America) HIV is not the death sentence that it was at the time, the film still packs an emotional wallop. It is the portrait of a completely self-centered man who is willing to put others at risk in search of his own pleasure and self-actualization. Is he a despicable character? Yes. Does that mean the film is automatically bad? No,however... The film contains too many unfocused scenes of characters lashing out. By the fourth or fifth scene of the young female protagonist screaming on the phone, screaming in the street, screaming at the door of the apartment, it becomes overdetermined. The film tries to tackle too many subjects--sadomasochism, skinheads, internalized homophobia, bisexuality, AIDS and responsibility, teenage love... it ends up something of a hot mess. I gave it six out of ten because I feel that it is worth seeing, because it captures a certain zeitgeist of the pre-antiretroviral moment, but one does feel a bit on watching it today that it has not aged all that well.

    Terrible, meaningless French film with trademark French characters who are totally unlikeable and completely self centred. Plot deals with a very heavy, multi-layered subject - that of AIDS and bi-sexual relationships - yet fails entirely in its attempt to do anything with it. The whole movie is almost like a lame excuse for controversial sex scenes, though this is nothing new to the French. The reasonably strong performances from the lead players can do nothing to redeem their ugly roles and the nonsense which one might otherwise call a storyline. "Savage Nights" never stood a chance! This is such a bad movie its just plain frustrating trying to sift through the mess, confusion and loathsome people to find a reason why? Why?!! All controversy and no idea! Just downright awful! When you tell a story, have a point. Friday, September 15, 1995 - Astor Theatre

    Difficult for me to understand that this movie got a Cesar and even worse that viewers would like it. Sick people can be found in any race, religion, gender or sexual orientation. True enough, numerous movies will explore the black side of humanity and some are remarkable pieces of art. When it comes to sexuality, the subject is more delicate and requires a lot of intelligence from the part of the director to get the message, if any, across. In Les Nuits Fauves, I believe the border is crossed by showing devious animal behavior attached to the main character, a bisexual gay. And this is not what homosexuality is about. Garbage is the only word which comes to my mind, but again, others may have a different opinion.

    ...but pictures a completely different perspective on HIV and AIDS. No supportive family here. No struggle with society for it to acknowledge on our humanity, regardless of sexual preference or health status. This picture is an invaluable reference for all those trying to understand terminal disease -AIDS in particular- or in the process of facing death. Just seems important to mention that Collard's actual treatments were filmed and included on the final cut. The bouncing around of high-low's, from absolute certainty of overcoming the disease to deep depression and sending everything -love included- straight to hell. But also the dangerous and sometimes silly sense of humor with which the director plays his role, is what makes this movie invaluable to me. To my knowledge this is the first film in which HIV positive blood is used as a defensive weapon, and saves the life of two of the characters. I sincerely hope that there is some form of afterlife, and that they have cable. Collard deserves to know he was, is, deeply appreciated, as so many others who where "cheated" out of time, to see their work achieve recognition. One is what one does, they say.

    The movie is a classical tragedy. The star, writer, director Cyril Collard has Aids and knows he is dying when making the film. He storms and rages against the forces of negativity and affirms life in ways that seem obscene to many, but really focus on the basics of life, love and the willingness to actually live your life, even knowing that you are about to die. To quote Dylan Thomas, "He rages against the dying of the night." This is not a gloomy film, except for the immense talent that Collard has in a number of areas, not the least writing and directing. The tragedy is that his libertine life of reckless homosexuality killed him (and many others). Unlike Philadelphia, an artifice of politically correct, maudlin nonsense, this film has Aids sometimes right in your face and sometimes in the background, but it is always there. Hedonism killed many and still does in the Aids epidemic and in the U.S.A., this film would attract few positive reviews and almost no distribution because Collard refuses to play the victim game. Over 80% of Aids deaths have been caused by homosexual behavior. In the film Collard can't control his impulses and because of Aids he wants to squeeze as much out of life as he can. The love story with Laura, beautifully played by Romane Bohringer, is tragic in and of itself, but their love is fatally compromised by his disease. Collard desperately wanted to live his life with Aids and not have Aids run his life. Unfortunately, that is impossible, although he gives it a mighty effort to free himself from thoughts of death, which never really leave him. He continues to have grimy homosexual encounters, supposedly not involving dangerous sex (at least in the film); my surmise is that in real life he lived dangerously right up to the end. When he has sex with Laura the first time, he doesn't use a condom and doesn't tell her he has Aids--a classic kind of denial, an attempt to conquer the disease through action , which is selfish. Many homosexuals will see this film, which other scenes do not really show them in a positive light, as a film to suppress. Reckless behavior has volcanoed in the last few years, but gets no publicity because of the left-wing press who refuses to see Aids victims as anything but victims, who didn't really cause their disease. Collard's film slaps the faces of hypocrisy and lying about Aids again and again in this film. It is a testimony to his will to live and to make a film that doesn't cover up the reality of how Aids is spread and how little impulse control many gays have. Drugs will not stop Aids deaths, safe sex and sometimes no sex will. Also, and very important, Collard wants to show that the heterosexual relationship with a loving woman is the way to live your life, but for him his refusal to control his impulses and perhaps his genetic inability to control them (though that is difficult to infer), keeps him from what would have saved him. Hedonism is not spat on in this movie, but its terrible results in many cases are exemplified in the tragic death of such a talented and lovely man.

    Les Nuits Fauves/savage nights: for those of you who are maybe not accustomed to watching world cinema, i wouldn't advise you view this as your first taster! Most of you who have an A-level in French may know this one......Although far from a pleasant plot, the film's excellent cinematography and use of rich, vivid dream sequences, more than makes up for the lack of inter-character development. What makes this film more tragic is the fact that its main star (and director)also a bisexual 'free spirit', had a somewhat similar end to his life, dying from an HIV related illness just one year after the movie was released. i think this adds to the whole feeling of the film - as you watch his respective lovers (one male, one a teenage girl) desperately try to hold his admiration and attention, you almost forget that the main character himself is trying to come to terms with his own eventual demise. although a serious subject, the carefree attitude of the main man leaves a sense of Hope.

    One of the best early films to deal with AIDs and the powerful feelings that come up when one has to deal with it. The acting and the passion of the roles by the actors is very good, very intense. The love for life that comes through in the desperation of the main characters is beautiful. Lots of frustration and anger about having AIDs but ultimately the choice to fight to live comes through and this film was much ahead of it's American counterparts for the time. Most of the contemporary films in America were about the death and dying of people with Aids not the struggle to go on living and that's what sets this film apart from the others of it's time.
