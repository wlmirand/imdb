    Victor Frankenstein is inspired to become a doctor by the tragic death of his mother during childbirth. With the help of his mentor's notes and plenty of necessary human parts, he creates an artificial life form. Victor rejects the artificial man he just created due the horrifying outlook of the creature. He tries to kill it and promises to change his own nature for the better. The monster escapes and later swears revenge. Among the many remakes and reboots of horror classics in the 90's, this one was brought to screen by Kenneth Branagh along with superlative actors such as De Niro, Helena Bonham Carter, Ian Holm, John Cleese and Tom Hulce among others. Branagh obviously wanted to class up the epic horror story and so goes for the emotional touch instead of pure horror. Helena and De Niro gave amazing performances, but they are hampered by the hamfisted writing and direction. After a great start to his character where he was totally immersed in it, you can see De Niro almost giving up by the end. Branagh who also plays the lead as Victor Frankenstein is overzealous and an unsympathetic character even when he tries his hardest to make you empathize with him. At the end of the day, the Frankenstein is pretentious, yet flat and uninspiring. There's melodrama and then there's the parody of a melodrama. Unfortunately, this one falls in the latter category even with all its good intentions. There were several times where I unintentionally burst out laughing. I haven't read the novel, but this movie sure doesn't deserve to put up Mary Shelley's name and tarnish her reputation. 4/10

    Kenneth Branagh's film adaptation of Shelley's classic novel, "Frankenstein," is probably more faithful to the novel than other adaptations. Robert DeNiro gave a brilliant performance as the Creature almost unrecognizable. Kenneth Branagh is wonderful as the mad scientist Victor Frankenstein but I was confused by why he abandoned his creation perhaps he realized his abomination. Shelley was way ahead in writing about how man wants to play and be God but not realizing the consequences. The film has a strong supporting cast with recognizable British actors and actresses. Helena Bonham Carter is great as Elizabeth but don't forget Ian Holm as Victor's father or Cherie Lunghi as his mother. The film's quality is first rate but perhaps slow moving at times until the conclusion. Still Branagh is always brilliant especially as Victor Frankenstein.

    To try and show us what a diverse actor he is, Boob Dinero took the part of The Monster in this slapdash version of the Mary Shelley classic. He's kind, he's considerate, he's --- Mr. Nice Guy Frankenstein! Ol' Frankie has noticed that a poor family has no viddles for supper tonight, so The Frankster decides to help out by tearing up a hundred turnips out the frozen ground and leaving them on the family's doorstep..... awwww, that was sweet. I'm sure that's just what they wanted -- to eat turnips until Christmas. If Franky-Wanky is so cool, then why didn't he wash the damn things before he offered them as a gift? Or how come he didn't pull a six-pack of Spam out of the ground so the family could have some meat on their plates? Uninspired (and totally unnecessary) remake. Boob Dinero may be the most over-rated bad actor around. Want proof? See him in 'Awakenings'.... pffft.... now THAT sucked!!

    In the nineties films based upon works of literature were commonly given an official title incorporating the name of the author of the work, so this film was at the time often referred to as "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" rather than simply "Frankenstein". There was, apparently, a technical reason for this connected with copyright law, but some viewers and reviewers took this form of title as an indication that the film would be more faithful to the original book than previous attempts to film it had been. Such an expectation was to be disappointed in the case of something like the eccentric "William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet" (definitely Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet rather than Shakespeare's), but here Kenneth Branagh does try and remain more faithful to the original than those old Boris Karloff adaptations from the thirties. (Branagh was so keen on authenticity that he even retained the love between Victor Frankenstein and his adopted sister Elizabeth, something which seems far creepier today, even though they are not related by blood, than it probably did in Shelley's day. The main part of the story takes place in the 1790s, the decade when the French Revolution was at its height, and when revolutionary fervour threatened to overwhelm the rest of Europe. There is no direct reference to these events in the film, but the period is certainly an appropriate one, as young Victor is aiming to bring about a revolution in the scientific sphere far more radical than anything attempted by the likes of Robespierre and Saint-Just in the political sphere. Victor has been obsessed with death ever since his mother died giving birth to his younger brother, and vows that he will use his scientific studies to find a way to conquer death. He comes to believe, from his study of the works of alchemists, that it is possible to create life by artificial means, and persists with his experiments despite the warning of his teacher Professor Waldman that they can only end in disaster. He eventually manages to create a being by piecing together parts from various human corpses and to bring it to life by means of electricity. Branagh not only directed but also starred as Victor, one of two remarkable performances in this film. In this version Frankenstein is not a mad scientist holed up in some spooky old castle, but rather a young student at the University of Ingolstadt. (This was at one time one of the most famous universities in Germany, but it closed in 1799, only a few years after the story is set). Nor is he some nerdy or unworldly intellectual, but rather a passionate young man whose two great passions are his love for Elizabeth and his belief that his work will confer great benefits on mankind. This is a highly physical performance; we get to see plenty of shots of Branagh's naked torso, emphasising his character's passionate nature. The other outstanding performance comes from Robert De Niro as the Monster, or The Creation as it is referred to here. The Creation is, a hideous, deformed creature, yet at first its impulses are gentle, kindly ones. If is only when it is rejected by humanity that it becomes murderous, vowing revenge on mankind in general and in particular on its creator, who has bestowed upon it the unwanted gift of life. De Niro was an actor who made a sensational start to his career in the seventies, starring in films like "Godfather II" and "Taxi Driver", and although his reputation has perhaps suffered somewhat since as a result of his appearing in too many inferior movies, he nevertheless retains the power to shock us by some electrifying performance. "King of Comedy", "The Mission" and "Cape Fear" were all examples of this power, and "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" is another. He manages the difficult feat of making The Creation both frightful and pitiable. Despite the late eighteenth century setting, this is no work of "heritage drama" in the Merchant/Ivory style. It is rather a visually dark film, one which dwells on the squalor of the past rather than its splendours. Even the scenes set in the elegant Frankenstein family home are rather gloomy; Branagh clearly intended to give it a look which matches the tragic and violent events which make up its plot. (Shelley's novel can be seen as an exercise on Gothic horror as well as pioneering science fiction). Mary Shelley does not perhaps rank as highly in the modern pantheon of English literature as her husband Percy, but she does at least have the distinction of having created in "Frankenstein" one of the great myths of modern times, a story which is known to millions who have never read her original novel. (I am here using the word "myth" in William Golding's sense to mean not a falsehood but a truth which can only be told in the form of a story). The familiarity of that story is, of course, mainly due to the many film adaptations, although it must be said that some of those were not very faithful. Kenneth Branagh, however, deserves credit for making a film which respects the intellectual and philosophical complexity of Shelley's original. I would not rank it quite as highly as some of his great Shakespeare adaptations, notably "Much Ado about Nothing" and "Hamlet", but it runs them a close second. 8/10

    Science versus Religion: The Idea which was Destined to Fail With knowledge comes personal responsibility; the denial of responsibility leads to tragic outcomes. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is a movie about a scientist Victor Frankenstein who becomes obsessed with the idea of creating life after his mother's death, which devastates him. He works hard for a long time until his creation is complete, but the first signs of life in the monster's corpse terrify him and he decides to destroy it. The creature, however, manages to escape from Frankenstein's laboratory which then becomes the start of his agony. After he steps into a real world he is not accepted by society, but on the contrary, is faced humiliation, aversion and reprobation. Thus, all these facts give a start to a tragedy which does not leave anyone indifferent. In my opinion, it is misnomer to call the existence "Monster" as most of us do. I would rather say he is a victim, a pathetic creature - an outcome of human-being's uncontrolled thirst for knowledge. However, as we know, Victor Frankenstein did not pursue anything bad, all he wanted was to reduce human-being's suffering of loss. Initially, his intention was to bring people happiness, because after he lost his mother he felt on himself how it is to lose someone. But unfortunately, he could not accomplish what he desired to accomplish, in fact. He totally failed. In the rest of my essay, I would like to talk about the reasons of his failure. First reason of his failure is the fact that by creating the existence, doctor Frankenstein oversteps all the bounds of morality and deference to God. Moreover, he oversteps all the bounds of science. He was excessively thirsty for knowledge, but that was the limit. Consciously or unconsciously, but by creating the "human-like existence", he automatically becomes omniscient  that is, God-like. However, as we know, from religious perspective, no one except God is allowed to do anything like that, as our protagonist does. In order to realize his crazy idea, Frankenstein sweeps everything away on his road including all aspects of ethics. However, even his idea about creating a human, is out of sanity that can foreshadow his eventual fail. No matter how good and kind Frankenstein's intentions were, his attempts to outreach almighty goes beyond the limit and, in the long run, he pays a very high price to all his deeds. Second reason that leads him to fail is his irresponsibility to his own creature. After creating the being, Frankenstein himself becomes terrified of it. How come it is possible? Is it typical of a father to get scared of his son? When God created us did he show the same attitude to its creatures?  No. After almighty created us we were put into a paradise, where our roots Adam and Eve were supported with everything  shelter, food, work and the most important thing  the Father's love and care. But what the poor existence faces after he is created?  Reprobation. The doctor is the one who creates the creature and he must be the one who should take responsibility for his life. However, as we watched, Frankenstein initially treats his creature as a neuter gender and even does not bother himself to name it. I think if he had taken care of his being and taught him what is good and what is bad, things would have taken completely another turn. And the final reason of such a tragic end is the rejection of "the unnamed" by society. The creature is bitter and dejected after being turned away from human civilization, much the same way that Adam in "Paradise Lost" was turned out of the Garden of Eden. One difference, though, makes the creature a sympathetic character. In the biblical story, Adam causes his own fate by sinning. In this case, Frankenstein causes the creature's hideous existence that leads to the creature's being spurned. Thus, being over and over again rejected by society makes the creature become violent and revengeful. Such a poor, devil-may-care attitude of people to him kills all good traits in him. To conclude, no matter what is the creature like, no matter how good or bad he is, his monstrous appearance would never allow him to grow accustomed to society. He is created to be rejected. It is fact, very bitter fact - the outcome of human-being's irresponsibility and egoism to fulfill its thirst for knowledge. According to Bible, knowledge is considered to be an evil that can destroy the humanity. Just like Eve, doctor Frankenstein reaches for a prohibited knowledge. He goes beyond the limit of a science and morality. He acts against God's rules, which does not lead to anything good, but to a severe punishment.

    Much like "Bram Stoker's Dracula (Coppola produced), here is a stylish, beautifully filmed, & acted update of a classic story. Some people fault Kenneth Branagh for his hyper dramatics, both in the direction, editing, & his acting in this film. I say it was just terrific! Here is a man so obsessed by his mother's death, that he wants nothing less than to bring an end to death! His whirlwind performance is a hypnotizing! A man so possessed by his vision, that it would eventually destroy everyone around him he loves & eventually himself. The most extreme case of irony, of a man who wanted to give life, but in the end brought nothing but death. Robert De Niro. What can I say about his performance as the monster? Not since Boris Karloff's great portrayal, have I seen such pathos, love, & and anger in Frankstein's creation. His interpretation should of at least won him an Oscar nomination. Nothing short of brilliant! "Mary Shelly's Frankenstein" is a film filled with a tornadic vortex of emotions, actions, & circumstance. It is a film that can sweep the viewer in to it's catapulting crescendos & crashes. An emotional roller-coaster ride to one man's oblivion. Profoundly sad, but also, profoundly mesmerizing! Only "the Bride of Frankenstein" matches this film in importance, as a truly transcending film from a classic story, of one man's madness.

    This is a good film but it does NOT follow the Frankenstein story quite well. I think Francis Ford Coppola put a little more effort into his version of Bram Stoker's Dracula than what he put into his adaptation of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. First the deviations from the novel: 1. The creature: In the original novel he had long black hair and did not speak like a Stroke victim. He was actually hyper intelligent and learned exceedingly fast. He was very articulate, perhaps more so than his creator and quoted things like Paradise Lost. In the novel he did not sound like a stroke victim. 2. Elizabeth's heart was not ripped out in the novel. She was strangled. 3. Elizabeth was never brought back in the style of the Frankenstein creature in the novel. For many this is the point where the film jumps the shark. 4. I don't like that this film leaves out the secondary moral of the story. The first moral is always remembered in films that one should not tamper in God's territory, that we should not mess with nature. But what many films forget is the secondary moral, that like a child who had been neglected by a parent the creature had to learn to forgive and that revenge would bring him no peace. I don't know why so many films leave this aspect out. If you want a version of Frankenstein that actually follows Mary Shelley's novel check out the version produced by Hallmark and released to DVD by Lion's Gate starring Luke Goss as the creature. That mini-series version of Frankenstein from 2004 is the most faithful to the book and has (in my opinion) the most sympathetic version of the creature. Now, aside from straying from the novel I will not deny this is a good film, even if some moments are rather hammy and feel as if they were created specifically for the film. This is still an enjoyable movie and does retain the basic ideas behind Mary Shelley's novel. This is a good film with many good actors and special effects that hold up well after nearly twenty years. It's a timeless story and when done correctly the film adaptation is ageless. This was done well. This is one of my top five favorite Frankenstein movies. My favorite Frankenstein films are as follows: 1. The Hallmark version of Frankenstein starring Luke Goss and released through Lion's Gate in 2004. Don't confuse it with any other Frankenstein productions from 2004. Make certain it is the version with Luke Goss as the creature if you choose to watch it. 2. The Bride from 1984. Not to be confused with the more well known "Bride of Frankenstein" this one starred Sting as Baron Frankenstein and Clancy Brown as the creature. This one is a guilty pleasure for me because even though it is cheesy (and very Hammer-esque) it is one of the only versions to have a happy ending for the creature. 3. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. This one is good for it's production values and for drawing attention to the original novel. It's not as faithful as it likes to boast but it is still a good movie. 4. Frankenstein created woman. This is a good one released through Hammer and featuring Peter Cushing as Dr. Frankenstein. This one is cheesy but enjoyable and has all the trappings one expects from a Hammer movie. 5. Frankenstein with Boris Karloff for creating the famous archetype. This 1931 Frankenstein does not follow the book but it is good film and was well made. The image of the creature in this film adaptation with his flat head, bolts in the neck, (apparently) green skin, and elevator shoes is probably the most well known and most associated with the creature even though it's nothing like what Mary Shelley described. 6. Bride of Frankenstein, the sequel to the Karloff version of Frankenestein and directly continues where the 1931 version ended.

    Despite the title, this is not Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein." It's the reanimated corpse of Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein," stitched together with various horror-movie conventions that didn't exist yet in Shelley's time, partly because we've come to know them from other film versions of "Frankenstein." For instance, early in the novel, the 17-year-old Victor Frankenstein begins university and has a couple of quiet office conversations with Professors Krempe and Waldman, neither of whom are medical doctors. He then skips Krempe's lectures and attends only the more inspiring Waldman's. Here, we get the thirty-something (!) Branagh confronting Krempe in a lecture / operating theater, loudly demanding instruction in the ancient theories of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus -- theories that the novel's Victor had already given up on. It's a flashier scene, it's very Hollywood, and it may be "inspired by" Shelley's version, but it nearly reverses the novel's point, scrambling its analysis of how Victor ends up going wrong. The portrayal of the Creature also messes with the story's moral. Yes, he's played for sympathy in a way that's in line with the novel; this may be how Branagh and Coppola convinced themselves that they were doing Shelley's version. But as others here have noted, DeNiro, even with a Bronx accent, is not frightening enough. OK, so he's got some facial scars -- he's not eight feet tall, he doesn't look overpowering, and he seems too obviously decent to suddenly start killing people. Granted, it would be hard even for a great actor to capture the eloquent and well- read yet savage beast that Shelley imagines, but you at least need to make him look frightening enough that we can understand people attacking him and fleeing in terror. The fact that he's "ugly," as he puts it, isn't enough to explain the tragedy. In that regard, a more "traditional" Halloween or horror-movie Frankenstein might actually have served the story better. There are other very big changes, especially late in the story, but I won't give them away. If you leave Shelley out of it -- and in fairness, the producers should have left her out of the title -- and if you overlook a number of things that don't make much sense, then it's a glossy and reasonably entertaining version of "Frankenstein." But it's not Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein," it's another in a long line of loose adaptations.

    Beautiful sets, magnificent lighting and a cornucopia of some of the finest actors on the planet cannot save this film from a real dog of a script and appalling direction. People run here, there, and everywhere. Lighting flashes, Nooooooooooo! is yelled and yelled again. Its a dogs dinner of every trope in the business, with much emphasis on "significant" lines from shallowly developed characters and scenes that linger or hinge on some inconsequential point that may have seemed dramatic somewhere, sometime, but not in the final product. It's nearly two hours long, but feels like three and perhaps should have been cut to one. There is little to celebrate save one great shot worthy of note, Victor Frankenstein carrying the body of Elizabeth up a winding staircase of towering RKO magnificence whilst trailing a long blood red cape.

Such an expectation was to be disappointed in the case of something like the eccentric "William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet" (definitely Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet rather than Shakespeare's), but here Kenneth Branagh does try and remain more faithful to the original than those old Boris Karloff adaptations from the thirties. (Branagh was so keen on authenticity that he even retained the love between Victor Frankenstein and his adopted sister Elizabeth, something which seems far creepier today, even though they are not related by blood, than it probably did in Shelley's day. The main part of the story takes place in the 1790s, the decade when the French Revolution was at its height, and when revolutionary fervour threatened to overwhelm the rest of Europe. There is no direct reference to these events in the film, but the period is certainly an appropriate one, as young Victor is aiming to bring about a revolution in the scientific sphere far more radical than anything attempted by the likes of Robespierre and Saint-Just in the political sphere. Victor has been obsessed with death ever since his mother died giving birth to his younger brother, and vows that he will use his scientific studies to find a way to conquer death. He comes to believe, from his study of the works of alchemists, that it is possible to create life by artificial means, and persists with his experiments despite the warning of his teacher Professor Waldman that they can only end in disaster. He eventually manages to create a being by piecing together parts from various human corpses and to bring it to life by means of electricity. Branagh not only directed but also starred as Victor, one of two remarkable performances in this film. In this version Frankenstein is not a mad scientist holed up in some spooky old castle, but rather a young student at the University of Ingolstadt. (This was at one time one of the most famous universities in Germany, but it closed in 1799, only a few years after the story is set). Nor is he some nerdy or unworldly intellectual, but rather a passionate young man whose two great passions are his love for Elizabeth and his belief that his work will confer great benefits on mankind. This is a highly physical performance; we get to see plenty of shots of Branagh's naked torso, emphasising his character's passionate nature. The other outstanding performance comes from Robert De Niro as the Monster, or The Creation as it is referred to here. The Creation is, a hideous, deformed creature, yet at first its impulses are gentle, kindly ones. If is only when it is rejected by humanity that it becomes murderous, vowing revenge on mankind in general and in particular on its creator, who has bestowed upon it the unwanted gift of life. De Niro was an actor who made a sensational start to his career in the seventies, starring in films like "Godfather II" and "Taxi Driver", and although his reputation has perhaps suffered somewhat since as a result of his appearing in too many inferior movies, he nevertheless retains the power to shock us by some electrifying performance. "King of Comedy", "The Mission" and "Cape Fear" were all examples of this power, and "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" is another. He manages the difficult feat of making The Creation both frightful and pitiable. Despite the late eighteenth century setting, this is no work of "heritage drama" in the Merchant/Ivory style. It is rather a visually dark film, one which dwells on the squalor of the past rather than its splendours. Even the scenes set in the elegant Frankenstein family home are rather gloomy; Branagh clearly intended to give it a look which matches the tragic and violent events which make up its plot. (Shelley's novel can be seen as an exercise on Gothic horror as well as pioneering science fiction). Mary Shelley does not perhaps rank as highly in the modern pantheon of English literature as her husband Percy, but she does at least have the distinction of having created in "Frankenstein" one of the great myths of modern times, a story which is known to millions who have never read her original novel. (I am here using the word "myth" in William Golding's sense to mean not a falsehood but a truth which can only be told in the form of a story). The familiarity of that story is, of course, mainly due to the many film adaptations, although it must be said that some of those were not very faithful. Kenneth Branagh, however, deserves credit for making a film which respects the intellectual and philosophical complexity of Shelley's original. I would not rank it quite as highly as some of his great Shakespeare adaptations, notably "Much Ado about Nothing" and "Hamlet", but it runs them a close second. 8/10

    Science versus Religion: The Idea which was Destined to Fail With knowledge comes personal responsibility; the denial of responsibility leads to tragic outcomes. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is a movie about a scientist Victor Frankenstein who becomes obsessed with the idea of creating life after his mother's death, which devastates him. He works hard for a long time until his creation is complete, but the first signs of life in the monster's corpse terrify him and he decides to destroy it. The creature, however, manages to escape from Frankenstein's laboratory which then becomes the start of his agony. After he steps into a real world he is not accepted by society, but on the contrary, is faced humiliation, aversion and reprobation. Thus, all these facts give a start to a tragedy which does not leave anyone indifferent. In my opinion, it is misnomer to call the existence "Monster" as most of us do. I would rather say he is a victim, a pathetic creature - an outcome of human-being's uncontrolled thirst for knowledge. However, as we know, Victor Frankenstein did not pursue anything bad, all he wanted was to reduce human-being's suffering of loss. Initially, his intention was to bring people happiness, because after he lost his mother he felt on himself how it is to lose someone. But unfortunately, he could not accomplish what he desired to accomplish, in fact. He totally failed. In the rest of my essay, I would like to talk about the reasons of his failure. First reason of his failure is the fact that by creating the existence, doctor Frankenstein oversteps all the bounds of morality and deference to God. Moreover, he oversteps all the bounds of science. He was excessively thirsty for knowledge, but that was the limit. Consciously or unconsciously, but by creating the "human-like existence", he automatically becomes omniscient  that is, God-like. However, as we know, from religious perspective, no one except God is allowed to do anything like that, as our protagonist does. In order to realize his crazy idea, Frankenstein sweeps everything away on his road including all aspects of ethics. However, even his idea about creating a human, is out of sanity that can foreshadow his eventual fail. No matter how good and kind Frankenstein's intentions were, his attempts to outreach almighty goes beyond the limit and, in the long run, he pays a very high price to all his deeds. Second reason that leads him to fail is his irresponsibility to his own creature. After creating the being, Frankenstein himself becomes terrified of it. How come it is possible? Is it typical of a father to get scared of his son? When God created us did he show the same attitude to its creatures?  No. After almighty created us we were put into a paradise, where our roots Adam and Eve were supported with everything  shelter, food, work and the most important thing  the Father's love and care. But what the poor existence faces after he is created?  Reprobation. The doctor is the one who creates the creature and he must be the one who should take responsibility for his life. However, as we watched, Frankenstein initially treats his creature as a neuter gender and even does not bother himself to name it. I think if he had taken care of his being and taught him what is good and what is bad, things would have taken completely another turn. And the final reason of such a tragic end is the rejection of "the unnamed" by society. The creature is bitter and dejected after being turned away from human civilization, much the same way that Adam in "Paradise Lost" was turned out of the Garden of Eden. One difference, though, makes the creature a sympathetic character. In the biblical story, Adam causes his own fate by sinning. In this case, Frankenstein causes the creature's hideous existence that leads to the creature's being spurned. Thus, being over and over again rejected by society makes the creature become violent and revengeful. Such a poor, devil-may-care attitude of people to him kills all good traits in him. To conclude, no matter what is the creature like, no matter how good or bad he is, his monstrous appearance would never allow him to grow accustomed to society. He is created to be rejected. It is fact, very bitter fact - the outcome of human-being's irresponsibility and egoism to fulfill its thirst for knowledge. According to Bible, knowledge is considered to be an evil that can destroy the humanity. Just like Eve, doctor Frankenstein reaches for a prohibited knowledge. He goes beyond the limit of a science and morality. He acts against God's rules, which does not lead to anything good, but to a severe punishment.

    Much like "Bram Stoker's Dracula (Coppola produced), here is a stylish, beautifully filmed, & acted update of a classic story. Some people fault Kenneth Branagh for his hyper dramatics, both in the direction, editing, & his acting in this film. I say it was just terrific! Here is a man so obsessed by his mother's death, that he wants nothing less than to bring an end to death! His whirlwind performance is a hypnotizing! A man so possessed by his vision, that it would eventually destroy everyone around him he loves & eventually himself. The most extreme case of irony, of a man who wanted to give life, but in the end brought nothing but death. Robert De Niro. What can I say about his performance as the monster? Not since Boris Karloff's great portrayal, have I seen such pathos, love, & and anger in Frankstein's creation. His interpretation should of at least won him an Oscar nomination. Nothing short of brilliant! "Mary Shelly's Frankenstein" is a film filled with a tornadic vortex of emotions, actions, & circumstance. It is a film that can sweep the viewer in to it's catapulting crescendos & crashes. An emotional roller-coaster ride to one man's oblivion. Profoundly sad, but also, profoundly mesmerizing! Only "the Bride of Frankenstein" matches this film in importance, as a truly transcending film from a classic story, of one man's madness.

    This is a good film but it does NOT follow the Frankenstein story quite well. I think Francis Ford Coppola put a little more effort into his version of Bram Stoker's Dracula than what he put into his adaptation of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. First the deviations from the novel: 1. The creature: In the original novel he had long black hair and did not speak like a Stroke victim. He was actually hyper intelligent and learned exceedingly fast. He was very articulate, perhaps more so than his creator and quoted things like Paradise Lost. In the novel he did not sound like a stroke victim. 2. Elizabeth's heart was not ripped out in the novel. She was strangled. 3. Elizabeth was never brought back in the style of the Frankenstein creature in the novel. For many this is the point where the film jumps the shark. 4. I don't like that this film leaves out the secondary moral of the story. The first moral is always remembered in films that one should not tamper in God's territory, that we should not mess with nature. But what many films forget is the secondary moral, that like a child who had been neglected by a parent the creature had to learn to forgive and that revenge would bring him no peace. I don't know why so many films leave this aspect out. If you want a version of Frankenstein that actually follows Mary Shelley's novel check out the version produced by Hallmark and released to DVD by Lion's Gate starring Luke Goss as the creature. That mini-series version of Frankenstein from 2004 is the most faithful to the book and has (in my opinion) the most sympathetic version of the creature. Now, aside from straying from the novel I will not deny this is a good film, even if some moments are rather hammy and feel as if they were created specifically for the film. This is still an enjoyable movie and does retain the basic ideas behind Mary Shelley's novel. This is a good film with many good actors and special effects that hold up well after nearly twenty years. It's a timeless story and when done correctly the film adaptation is ageless. This was done well. This is one of my top five favorite Frankenstein movies. My favorite Frankenstein films are as follows: 1. The Hallmark version of Frankenstein starring Luke Goss and released through Lion's Gate in 2004. Don't confuse it with any other Frankenstein productions from 2004. Make certain it is the version with Luke Goss as the creature if you choose to watch it. 2. The Bride from 1984. Not to be confused with the more well known "Bride of Frankenstein" this one starred Sting as Baron Frankenstein and Clancy Brown as the creature. This one is a guilty pleasure for me because even though it is cheesy (and very Hammer-esque) it is one of the only versions to have a happy ending for the creature. 3. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. This one is good for it's production values and for drawing attention to the original novel. It's not as faithful as it likes to boast but it is still a good movie. 4. Frankenstein created woman. This is a good one released through Hammer and featuring Peter Cushing as Dr. Frankenstein. This one is cheesy but enjoyable and has all the trappings one expects from a Hammer movie. 5. Frankenstein with Boris Karloff for creating the famous archetype. This 1931 Frankenstein does not follow the book but it is good film and was well made. The image of the creature in this film adaptation with his flat head, bolts in the neck, (apparently) green skin, and elevator shoes is probably the most well known and most associated with the creature even though it's nothing like what Mary Shelley described. 6. Bride of Frankenstein, the sequel to the Karloff version of Frankenestein and directly continues where the 1931 version ended.

    Despite the title, this is not Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein." It's the reanimated corpse of Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein," stitched together with various horror-movie conventions that didn't exist yet in Shelley's time, partly because we've come to know them from other film versions of "Frankenstein." For instance, early in the novel, the 17-year-old Victor Frankenstein begins university and has a couple of quiet office conversations with Professors Krempe and Waldman, neither of whom are medical doctors. He then skips Krempe's lectures and attends only the more inspiring Waldman's. Here, we get the thirty-something (!) Branagh confronting Krempe in a lecture / operating theater, loudly demanding instruction in the ancient theories of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus -- theories that the novel's Victor had already given up on. It's a flashier scene, it's very Hollywood, and it may be "inspired by" Shelley's version, but it nearly reverses the novel's point, scrambling its analysis of how Victor ends up going wrong. The portrayal of the Creature also messes with the story's moral. Yes, he's played for sympathy in a way that's in line with the novel; this may be how Branagh and Coppola convinced themselves that they were doing Shelley's version. But as others here have noted, DeNiro, even with a Bronx accent, is not frightening enough. OK, so he's got some facial scars -- he's not eight feet tall, he doesn't look overpowering, and he seems too obviously decent to suddenly start killing people. Granted, it would be hard even for a great actor to capture the eloquent and well- read yet savage beast that Shelley imagines, but you at least need to make him look frightening enough that we can understand people attacking him and fleeing in terror. The fact that he's "ugly," as he puts it, isn't enough to explain the tragedy. In that regard, a more "traditional" Halloween or horror-movie Frankenstein might actually have served the story better. There are other very big changes, especially late in the story, but I won't give them away. If you leave Shelley out of it -- and in fairness, the producers should have left her out of the title -- and if you overlook a number of things that don't make much sense, then it's a glossy and reasonably entertaining version of "Frankenstein." But it's not Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein," it's another in a long line of loose adaptations.

    Beautiful sets, magnificent lighting and a cornucopia of some of the finest actors on the planet cannot save this film from a real dog of a script and appalling direction. People run here, there, and everywhere. Lighting flashes, Nooooooooooo! is yelled and yelled again. Its a dogs dinner of every trope in the business, with much emphasis on "significant" lines from shallowly developed characters and scenes that linger or hinge on some inconsequential point that may have seemed dramatic somewhere, sometime, but not in the final product. It's nearly two hours long, but feels like three and perhaps should have been cut to one. There is little to celebrate save one great shot worthy of note, Victor Frankenstein carrying the body of Elizabeth up a winding staircase of towering RKO magnificence whilst trailing a long blood red cape.

    Victor Frankenstein is inspired to become a doctor by the tragic death of his mother during childbirth. With the help of his mentor's notes and plenty of necessary human parts, he creates an artificial life form. Victor rejects the artificial man he just created due the horrifying outlook of the creature. He tries to kill it and promises to change his own nature for the better. The monster escapes and later swears revenge. Among the many remakes and reboots of horror classics in the 90's, this one was brought to screen by Kenneth Branagh along with superlative actors such as De Niro, Helena Bonham Carter, Ian Holm, John Cleese and Tom Hulce among others. Branagh obviously wanted to class up the epic horror story and so goes for the emotional touch instead of pure horror. Helena and De Niro gave amazing performances, but they are hampered by the hamfisted writing and direction. After a great start to his character where he was totally immersed in it, you can see De Niro almost giving up by the end. Branagh who also plays the lead as Victor Frankenstein is overzealous and an unsympathetic character even when he tries his hardest to make you empathize with him. At the end of the day, the Frankenstein is pretentious, yet flat and uninspiring. There's melodrama and then there's the parody of a melodrama. Unfortunately, this one falls in the latter category even with all its good intentions. There were several times where I unintentionally burst out laughing. I haven't read the novel, but this movie sure doesn't deserve to put up Mary Shelley's name and tarnish her reputation. 4/10

    Kenneth Branagh's film adaptation of Shelley's classic novel, "Frankenstein," is probably more faithful to the novel than other adaptations. Robert DeNiro gave a brilliant performance as the Creature almost unrecognizable. Kenneth Branagh is wonderful as the mad scientist Victor Frankenstein but I was confused by why he abandoned his creation perhaps he realized his abomination. Shelley was way ahead in writing about how man wants to play and be God but not realizing the consequences. The film has a strong supporting cast with recognizable British actors and actresses. Helena Bonham Carter is great as Elizabeth but don't forget Ian Holm as Victor's father or Cherie Lunghi as his mother. The film's quality is first rate but perhaps slow moving at times until the conclusion. Still Branagh is always brilliant especially as Victor Frankenstein.

    To try and show us what a diverse actor he is, Boob Dinero took the part of The Monster in this slapdash version of the Mary Shelley classic. He's kind, he's considerate, he's --- Mr. Nice Guy Frankenstein! Ol' Frankie has noticed that a poor family has no viddles for supper tonight, so The Frankster decides to help out by tearing up a hundred turnips out the frozen ground and leaving them on the family's doorstep..... awwww, that was sweet. I'm sure that's just what they wanted -- to eat turnips until Christmas. If Franky-Wanky is so cool, then why didn't he wash the damn things before he offered them as a gift? Or how come he didn't pull a six-pack of Spam out of the ground so the family could have some meat on their plates? Uninspired (and totally unnecessary) remake. Boob Dinero may be the most over-rated bad actor around. Want proof? See him in 'Awakenings'.... pffft.... now THAT sucked!!

    Forced to Survive in the real world, a man-made creature losses his Child- like innocence and transforms into an adult with bitterness, lust, vengeance - and deadly reasoning. This movie is a great tribute to Mary Shelly's novel. I read the novel when i was a kid, this movie just great, Robert DN plays the awesome monster, who longs for worldly things like normal human after being artificially created - a possible reference to Genetic engineering gone to waste like Terminator seeds (by Monsanto). other references or rip-off made by Time Burton Frankweenie in 1984 i think and then again animation in 2013

One difference, though, makes the creature a sympathetic character. In the biblical story, Adam causes his own fate by sinning. In this case, Frankenstein causes the creature's hideous existence that leads to the creature's being spurned. Thus, being over and over again rejected by society makes the creature become violent and revengeful. Such a poor, devil-may-care attitude of people to him kills all good traits in him. To conclude, no matter what is the creature like, no matter how good or bad he is, his monstrous appearance would never allow him to grow accustomed to society. He is created to be rejected. It is fact, very bitter fact - the outcome of human-being's irresponsibility and egoism to fulfill its thirst for knowledge. According to Bible, knowledge is considered to be an evil that can destroy the humanity. Just like Eve, doctor Frankenstein reaches for a prohibited knowledge. He goes beyond the limit of a science and morality. He acts against God's rules, which does not lead to anything good, but to a severe punishment.

    Much like "Bram Stoker's Dracula (Coppola produced), here is a stylish, beautifully filmed, & acted update of a classic story. Some people fault Kenneth Branagh for his hyper dramatics, both in the direction, editing, & his acting in this film. I say it was just terrific! Here is a man so obsessed by his mother's death, that he wants nothing less than to bring an end to death! His whirlwind performance is a hypnotizing! A man so possessed by his vision, that it would eventually destroy everyone around him he loves & eventually himself. The most extreme case of irony, of a man who wanted to give life, but in the end brought nothing but death. Robert De Niro. What can I say about his performance as the monster? Not since Boris Karloff's great portrayal, have I seen such pathos, love, & and anger in Frankstein's creation. His interpretation should of at least won him an Oscar nomination. Nothing short of brilliant! "Mary Shelly's Frankenstein" is a film filled with a tornadic vortex of emotions, actions, & circumstance. It is a film that can sweep the viewer in to it's catapulting crescendos & crashes. An emotional roller-coaster ride to one man's oblivion. Profoundly sad, but also, profoundly mesmerizing! Only "the Bride of Frankenstein" matches this film in importance, as a truly transcending film from a classic story, of one man's madness.

    This is a good film but it does NOT follow the Frankenstein story quite well. I think Francis Ford Coppola put a little more effort into his version of Bram Stoker's Dracula than what he put into his adaptation of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. First the deviations from the novel: 1. The creature: In the original novel he had long black hair and did not speak like a Stroke victim. He was actually hyper intelligent and learned exceedingly fast. He was very articulate, perhaps more so than his creator and quoted things like Paradise Lost. In the novel he did not sound like a stroke victim. 2. Elizabeth's heart was not ripped out in the novel. She was strangled. 3. Elizabeth was never brought back in the style of the Frankenstein creature in the novel. For many this is the point where the film jumps the shark. 4. I don't like that this film leaves out the secondary moral of the story. The first moral is always remembered in films that one should not tamper in God's territory, that we should not mess with nature. But what many films forget is the secondary moral, that like a child who had been neglected by a parent the creature had to learn to forgive and that revenge would bring him no peace. I don't know why so many films leave this aspect out. If you want a version of Frankenstein that actually follows Mary Shelley's novel check out the version produced by Hallmark and released to DVD by Lion's Gate starring Luke Goss as the creature. That mini-series version of Frankenstein from 2004 is the most faithful to the book and has (in my opinion) the most sympathetic version of the creature. Now, aside from straying from the novel I will not deny this is a good film, even if some moments are rather hammy and feel as if they were created specifically for the film. This is still an enjoyable movie and does retain the basic ideas behind Mary Shelley's novel. This is a good film with many good actors and special effects that hold up well after nearly twenty years. It's a timeless story and when done correctly the film adaptation is ageless. This was done well. This is one of my top five favorite Frankenstein movies. My favorite Frankenstein films are as follows: 1. The Hallmark version of Frankenstein starring Luke Goss and released through Lion's Gate in 2004. Don't confuse it with any other Frankenstein productions from 2004. Make certain it is the version with Luke Goss as the creature if you choose to watch it. 2. The Bride from 1984. Not to be confused with the more well known "Bride of Frankenstein" this one starred Sting as Baron Frankenstein and Clancy Brown as the creature. This one is a guilty pleasure for me because even though it is cheesy (and very Hammer-esque) it is one of the only versions to have a happy ending for the creature. 3. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. This one is good for it's production values and for drawing attention to the original novel. It's not as faithful as it likes to boast but it is still a good movie. 4. Frankenstein created woman. This is a good one released through Hammer and featuring Peter Cushing as Dr. Frankenstein. This one is cheesy but enjoyable and has all the trappings one expects from a Hammer movie. 5. Frankenstein with Boris Karloff for creating the famous archetype. This 1931 Frankenstein does not follow the book but it is good film and was well made. The image of the creature in this film adaptation with his flat head, bolts in the neck, (apparently) green skin, and elevator shoes is probably the most well known and most associated with the creature even though it's nothing like what Mary Shelley described. 6. Bride of Frankenstein, the sequel to the Karloff version of Frankenestein and directly continues where the 1931 version ended.

    Despite the title, this is not Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein." It's the reanimated corpse of Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein," stitched together with various horror-movie conventions that didn't exist yet in Shelley's time, partly because we've come to know them from other film versions of "Frankenstein." For instance, early in the novel, the 17-year-old Victor Frankenstein begins university and has a couple of quiet office conversations with Professors Krempe and Waldman, neither of whom are medical doctors. He then skips Krempe's lectures and attends only the more inspiring Waldman's. Here, we get the thirty-something (!) Branagh confronting Krempe in a lecture / operating theater, loudly demanding instruction in the ancient theories of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus -- theories that the novel's Victor had already given up on. It's a flashier scene, it's very Hollywood, and it may be "inspired by" Shelley's version, but it nearly reverses the novel's point, scrambling its analysis of how Victor ends up going wrong. The portrayal of the Creature also messes with the story's moral. Yes, he's played for sympathy in a way that's in line with the novel; this may be how Branagh and Coppola convinced themselves that they were doing Shelley's version. But as others here have noted, DeNiro, even with a Bronx accent, is not frightening enough. OK, so he's got some facial scars -- he's not eight feet tall, he doesn't look overpowering, and he seems too obviously decent to suddenly start killing people. Granted, it would be hard even for a great actor to capture the eloquent and well- read yet savage beast that Shelley imagines, but you at least need to make him look frightening enough that we can understand people attacking him and fleeing in terror. The fact that he's "ugly," as he puts it, isn't enough to explain the tragedy. In that regard, a more "traditional" Halloween or horror-movie Frankenstein might actually have served the story better. There are other very big changes, especially late in the story, but I won't give them away. If you leave Shelley out of it -- and in fairness, the producers should have left her out of the title -- and if you overlook a number of things that don't make much sense, then it's a glossy and reasonably entertaining version of "Frankenstein." But it's not Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein," it's another in a long line of loose adaptations.

    Beautiful sets, magnificent lighting and a cornucopia of some of the finest actors on the planet cannot save this film from a real dog of a script and appalling direction. People run here, there, and everywhere. Lighting flashes, Nooooooooooo! is yelled and yelled again. Its a dogs dinner of every trope in the business, with much emphasis on "significant" lines from shallowly developed characters and scenes that linger or hinge on some inconsequential point that may have seemed dramatic somewhere, sometime, but not in the final product. It's nearly two hours long, but feels like three and perhaps should have been cut to one. There is little to celebrate save one great shot worthy of note, Victor Frankenstein carrying the body of Elizabeth up a winding staircase of towering RKO magnificence whilst trailing a long blood red cape.

    Victor Frankenstein is inspired to become a doctor by the tragic death of his mother during childbirth. With the help of his mentor's notes and plenty of necessary human parts, he creates an artificial life form. Victor rejects the artificial man he just created due the horrifying outlook of the creature. He tries to kill it and promises to change his own nature for the better. The monster escapes and later swears revenge. Among the many remakes and reboots of horror classics in the 90's, this one was brought to screen by Kenneth Branagh along with superlative actors such as De Niro, Helena Bonham Carter, Ian Holm, John Cleese and Tom Hulce among others. Branagh obviously wanted to class up the epic horror story and so goes for the emotional touch instead of pure horror. Helena and De Niro gave amazing performances, but they are hampered by the hamfisted writing and direction. After a great start to his character where he was totally immersed in it, you can see De Niro almost giving up by the end. Branagh who also plays the lead as Victor Frankenstein is overzealous and an unsympathetic character even when he tries his hardest to make you empathize with him. At the end of the day, the Frankenstein is pretentious, yet flat and uninspiring. There's melodrama and then there's the parody of a melodrama. Unfortunately, this one falls in the latter category even with all its good intentions. There were several times where I unintentionally burst out laughing. I haven't read the novel, but this movie sure doesn't deserve to put up Mary Shelley's name and tarnish her reputation. 4/10

    Kenneth Branagh's film adaptation of Shelley's classic novel, "Frankenstein," is probably more faithful to the novel than other adaptations. Robert DeNiro gave a brilliant performance as the Creature almost unrecognizable. Kenneth Branagh is wonderful as the mad scientist Victor Frankenstein but I was confused by why he abandoned his creation perhaps he realized his abomination. Shelley was way ahead in writing about how man wants to play and be God but not realizing the consequences. The film has a strong supporting cast with recognizable British actors and actresses. Helena Bonham Carter is great as Elizabeth but don't forget Ian Holm as Victor's father or Cherie Lunghi as his mother. The film's quality is first rate but perhaps slow moving at times until the conclusion. Still Branagh is always brilliant especially as Victor Frankenstein.

    To try and show us what a diverse actor he is, Boob Dinero took the part of The Monster in this slapdash version of the Mary Shelley classic. He's kind, he's considerate, he's --- Mr. Nice Guy Frankenstein! Ol' Frankie has noticed that a poor family has no viddles for supper tonight, so The Frankster decides to help out by tearing up a hundred turnips out the frozen ground and leaving them on the family's doorstep..... awwww, that was sweet. I'm sure that's just what they wanted -- to eat turnips until Christmas. If Franky-Wanky is so cool, then why didn't he wash the damn things before he offered them as a gift? Or how come he didn't pull a six-pack of Spam out of the ground so the family could have some meat on their plates? Uninspired (and totally unnecessary) remake. Boob Dinero may be the most over-rated bad actor around. Want proof? See him in 'Awakenings'.... pffft.... now THAT sucked!!

    Forced to Survive in the real world, a man-made creature losses his Child- like innocence and transforms into an adult with bitterness, lust, vengeance - and deadly reasoning. This movie is a great tribute to Mary Shelly's novel. I read the novel when i was a kid, this movie just great, Robert DN plays the awesome monster, who longs for worldly things like normal human after being artificially created - a possible reference to Genetic engineering gone to waste like Terminator seeds (by Monsanto). other references or rip-off made by Time Burton Frankweenie in 1984 i think and then again animation in 2013

    In the nineties films based upon works of literature were commonly given an official title incorporating the name of the author of the work, so this film was at the time often referred to as "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" rather than simply "Frankenstein". There was, apparently, a technical reason for this connected with copyright law, but some viewers and reviewers took this form of title as an indication that the film would be more faithful to the original book than previous attempts to film it had been. Such an expectation was to be disappointed in the case of something like the eccentric "William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet" (definitely Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet rather than Shakespeare's), but here Kenneth Branagh does try and remain more faithful to the original than those old Boris Karloff adaptations from the thirties. (Branagh was so keen on authenticity that he even retained the love between Victor Frankenstein and his adopted sister Elizabeth, something which seems far creepier today, even though they are not related by blood, than it probably did in Shelley's day. The main part of the story takes place in the 1790s, the decade when the French Revolution was at its height, and when revolutionary fervour threatened to overwhelm the rest of Europe. There is no direct reference to these events in the film, but the period is certainly an appropriate one, as young Victor is aiming to bring about a revolution in the scientific sphere far more radical than anything attempted by the likes of Robespierre and Saint-Just in the political sphere. Victor has been obsessed with death ever since his mother died giving birth to his younger brother, and vows that he will use his scientific studies to find a way to conquer death. He comes to believe, from his study of the works of alchemists, that it is possible to create life by artificial means, and persists with his experiments despite the warning of his teacher Professor Waldman that they can only end in disaster. He eventually manages to create a being by piecing together parts from various human corpses and to bring it to life by means of electricity. Branagh not only directed but also starred as Victor, one of two remarkable performances in this film. In this version Frankenstein is not a mad scientist holed up in some spooky old castle, but rather a young student at the University of Ingolstadt. (This was at one time one of the most famous universities in Germany, but it closed in 1799, only a few years after the story is set). Nor is he some nerdy or unworldly intellectual, but rather a passionate young man whose two great passions are his love for Elizabeth and his belief that his work will confer great benefits on mankind. This is a highly physical performance; we get to see plenty of shots of Branagh's naked torso, emphasising his character's passionate nature. The other outstanding performance comes from Robert De Niro as the Monster, or The Creation as it is referred to here. The Creation is, a hideous, deformed creature, yet at first its impulses are gentle, kindly ones. If is only when it is rejected by humanity that it becomes murderous, vowing revenge on mankind in general and in particular on its creator, who has bestowed upon it the unwanted gift of life. De Niro was an actor who made a sensational start to his career in the seventies, starring in films like "Godfather II" and "Taxi Driver", and although his reputation has perhaps suffered somewhat since as a result of his appearing in too many inferior movies, he nevertheless retains the power to shock us by some electrifying performance. "King of Comedy", "The Mission" and "Cape Fear" were all examples of this power, and "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" is another. He manages the difficult feat of making The Creation both frightful and pitiable. Despite the late eighteenth century setting, this is no work of "heritage drama" in the Merchant/Ivory style. It is rather a visually dark film, one which dwells on the squalor of the past rather than its splendours. Even the scenes set in the elegant Frankenstein family home are rather gloomy; Branagh clearly intended to give it a look which matches the tragic and violent events which make up its plot. (Shelley's novel can be seen as an exercise on Gothic horror as well as pioneering science fiction). Mary Shelley does not perhaps rank as highly in the modern pantheon of English literature as her husband Percy, but she does at least have the distinction of having created in "Frankenstein" one of the great myths of modern times, a story which is known to millions who have never read her original novel. (I am here using the word "myth" in William Golding's sense to mean not a falsehood but a truth which can only be told in the form of a story). The familiarity of that story is, of course, mainly due to the many film adaptations, although it must be said that some of those were not very faithful. Kenneth Branagh, however, deserves credit for making a film which respects the intellectual and philosophical complexity of Shelley's original. I would not rank it quite as highly as some of his great Shakespeare adaptations, notably "Much Ado about Nothing" and "Hamlet", but it runs them a close second. 8/10

    Science versus Religion: The Idea which was Destined to Fail With knowledge comes personal responsibility; the denial of responsibility leads to tragic outcomes. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is a movie about a scientist Victor Frankenstein who becomes obsessed with the idea of creating life after his mother's death, which devastates him. He works hard for a long time until his creation is complete, but the first signs of life in the monster's corpse terrify him and he decides to destroy it. The creature, however, manages to escape from Frankenstein's laboratory which then becomes the start of his agony. After he steps into a real world he is not accepted by society, but on the contrary, is faced humiliation, aversion and reprobation. Thus, all these facts give a start to a tragedy which does not leave anyone indifferent. In my opinion, it is misnomer to call the existence "Monster" as most of us do. I would rather say he is a victim, a pathetic creature - an outcome of human-being's uncontrolled thirst for knowledge. However, as we know, Victor Frankenstein did not pursue anything bad, all he wanted was to reduce human-being's suffering of loss. Initially, his intention was to bring people happiness, because after he lost his mother he felt on himself how it is to lose someone. But unfortunately, he could not accomplish what he desired to accomplish, in fact. He totally failed. In the rest of my essay, I would like to talk about the reasons of his failure. First reason of his failure is the fact that by creating the existence, doctor Frankenstein oversteps all the bounds of morality and deference to God. Moreover, he oversteps all the bounds of science. He was excessively thirsty for knowledge, but that was the limit. Consciously or unconsciously, but by creating the "human-like existence", he automatically becomes omniscient  that is, God-like. However, as we know, from religious perspective, no one except God is allowed to do anything like that, as our protagonist does. In order to realize his crazy idea, Frankenstein sweeps everything away on his road including all aspects of ethics. However, even his idea about creating a human, is out of sanity that can foreshadow his eventual fail. No matter how good and kind Frankenstein's intentions were, his attempts to outreach almighty goes beyond the limit and, in the long run, he pays a very high price to all his deeds. Second reason that leads him to fail is his irresponsibility to his own creature. After creating the being, Frankenstein himself becomes terrified of it. How come it is possible? Is it typical of a father to get scared of his son? When God created us did he show the same attitude to its creatures?  No. After almighty created us we were put into a paradise, where our roots Adam and Eve were supported with everything  shelter, food, work and the most important thing  the Father's love and care. But what the poor existence faces after he is created?  Reprobation. The doctor is the one who creates the creature and he must be the one who should take responsibility for his life. However, as we watched, Frankenstein initially treats his creature as a neuter gender and even does not bother himself to name it. I think if he had taken care of his being and taught him what is good and what is bad, things would have taken completely another turn. And the final reason of such a tragic end is the rejection of "the unnamed" by society. The creature is bitter and dejected after being turned away from human civilization, much the same way that Adam in "Paradise Lost" was turned out of the Garden of Eden. One difference, though, makes the creature a sympathetic character. In the biblical story, Adam causes his own fate by sinning. In this case, Frankenstein causes the creature's hideous existence that leads to the creature's being spurned. Thus, being over and over again rejected by society makes the creature become violent and revengeful. Such a poor, devil-may-care attitude of people to him kills all good traits in him. To conclude, no matter what is the creature like, no matter how good or bad he is, his monstrous appearance would never allow him to grow accustomed to society. He is created to be rejected. It is fact, very bitter fact - the outcome of human-being's irresponsibility and egoism to fulfill its thirst for knowledge. According to Bible, knowledge is considered to be an evil that can destroy the humanity. Just like Eve, doctor Frankenstein reaches for a prohibited knowledge. He goes beyond the limit of a science and morality. He acts against God's rules, which does not lead to anything good, but to a severe punishment.

Yes, he's played for sympathy in a way that's in line with the novel; this may be how Branagh and Coppola convinced themselves that they were doing Shelley's version. But as others here have noted, DeNiro, even with a Bronx accent, is not frightening enough. OK, so he's got some facial scars -- he's not eight feet tall, he doesn't look overpowering, and he seems too obviously decent to suddenly start killing people. Granted, it would be hard even for a great actor to capture the eloquent and well- read yet savage beast that Shelley imagines, but you at least need to make him look frightening enough that we can understand people attacking him and fleeing in terror. The fact that he's "ugly," as he puts it, isn't enough to explain the tragedy. In that regard, a more "traditional" Halloween or horror-movie Frankenstein might actually have served the story better. There are other very big changes, especially late in the story, but I won't give them away. If you leave Shelley out of it -- and in fairness, the producers should have left her out of the title -- and if you overlook a number of things that don't make much sense, then it's a glossy and reasonably entertaining version of "Frankenstein." But it's not Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein," it's another in a long line of loose adaptations.

    Beautiful sets, magnificent lighting and a cornucopia of some of the finest actors on the planet cannot save this film from a real dog of a script and appalling direction. People run here, there, and everywhere. Lighting flashes, Nooooooooooo! is yelled and yelled again. Its a dogs dinner of every trope in the business, with much emphasis on "significant" lines from shallowly developed characters and scenes that linger or hinge on some inconsequential point that may have seemed dramatic somewhere, sometime, but not in the final product. It's nearly two hours long, but feels like three and perhaps should have been cut to one. There is little to celebrate save one great shot worthy of note, Victor Frankenstein carrying the body of Elizabeth up a winding staircase of towering RKO magnificence whilst trailing a long blood red cape.

    Victor Frankenstein is inspired to become a doctor by the tragic death of his mother during childbirth. With the help of his mentor's notes and plenty of necessary human parts, he creates an artificial life form. Victor rejects the artificial man he just created due the horrifying outlook of the creature. He tries to kill it and promises to change his own nature for the better. The monster escapes and later swears revenge. Among the many remakes and reboots of horror classics in the 90's, this one was brought to screen by Kenneth Branagh along with superlative actors such as De Niro, Helena Bonham Carter, Ian Holm, John Cleese and Tom Hulce among others. Branagh obviously wanted to class up the epic horror story and so goes for the emotional touch instead of pure horror. Helena and De Niro gave amazing performances, but they are hampered by the hamfisted writing and direction. After a great start to his character where he was totally immersed in it, you can see De Niro almost giving up by the end. Branagh who also plays the lead as Victor Frankenstein is overzealous and an unsympathetic character even when he tries his hardest to make you empathize with him. At the end of the day, the Frankenstein is pretentious, yet flat and uninspiring. There's melodrama and then there's the parody of a melodrama. Unfortunately, this one falls in the latter category even with all its good intentions. There were several times where I unintentionally burst out laughing. I haven't read the novel, but this movie sure doesn't deserve to put up Mary Shelley's name and tarnish her reputation. 4/10

    Kenneth Branagh's film adaptation of Shelley's classic novel, "Frankenstein," is probably more faithful to the novel than other adaptations. Robert DeNiro gave a brilliant performance as the Creature almost unrecognizable. Kenneth Branagh is wonderful as the mad scientist Victor Frankenstein but I was confused by why he abandoned his creation perhaps he realized his abomination. Shelley was way ahead in writing about how man wants to play and be God but not realizing the consequences. The film has a strong supporting cast with recognizable British actors and actresses. Helena Bonham Carter is great as Elizabeth but don't forget Ian Holm as Victor's father or Cherie Lunghi as his mother. The film's quality is first rate but perhaps slow moving at times until the conclusion. Still Branagh is always brilliant especially as Victor Frankenstein.

    To try and show us what a diverse actor he is, Boob Dinero took the part of The Monster in this slapdash version of the Mary Shelley classic. He's kind, he's considerate, he's --- Mr. Nice Guy Frankenstein! Ol' Frankie has noticed that a poor family has no viddles for supper tonight, so The Frankster decides to help out by tearing up a hundred turnips out the frozen ground and leaving them on the family's doorstep..... awwww, that was sweet. I'm sure that's just what they wanted -- to eat turnips until Christmas. If Franky-Wanky is so cool, then why didn't he wash the damn things before he offered them as a gift? Or how come he didn't pull a six-pack of Spam out of the ground so the family could have some meat on their plates? Uninspired (and totally unnecessary) remake. Boob Dinero may be the most over-rated bad actor around. Want proof? See him in 'Awakenings'.... pffft.... now THAT sucked!!

    In the nineties films based upon works of literature were commonly given an official title incorporating the name of the author of the work, so this film was at the time often referred to as "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" rather than simply "Frankenstein". There was, apparently, a technical reason for this connected with copyright law, but some viewers and reviewers took this form of title as an indication that the film would be more faithful to the original book than previous attempts to film it had been. Such an expectation was to be disappointed in the case of something like the eccentric "William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet" (definitely Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet rather than Shakespeare's), but here Kenneth Branagh does try and remain more faithful to the original than those old Boris Karloff adaptations from the thirties. (Branagh was so keen on authenticity that he even retained the love between Victor Frankenstein and his adopted sister Elizabeth, something which seems far creepier today, even though they are not related by blood, than it probably did in Shelley's day. The main part of the story takes place in the 1790s, the decade when the French Revolution was at its height, and when revolutionary fervour threatened to overwhelm the rest of Europe. There is no direct reference to these events in the film, but the period is certainly an appropriate one, as young Victor is aiming to bring about a revolution in the scientific sphere far more radical than anything attempted by the likes of Robespierre and Saint-Just in the political sphere. Victor has been obsessed with death ever since his mother died giving birth to his younger brother, and vows that he will use his scientific studies to find a way to conquer death. He comes to believe, from his study of the works of alchemists, that it is possible to create life by artificial means, and persists with his experiments despite the warning of his teacher Professor Waldman that they can only end in disaster. He eventually manages to create a being by piecing together parts from various human corpses and to bring it to life by means of electricity. Branagh not only directed but also starred as Victor, one of two remarkable performances in this film. In this version Frankenstein is not a mad scientist holed up in some spooky old castle, but rather a young student at the University of Ingolstadt. (This was at one time one of the most famous universities in Germany, but it closed in 1799, only a few years after the story is set). Nor is he some nerdy or unworldly intellectual, but rather a passionate young man whose two great passions are his love for Elizabeth and his belief that his work will confer great benefits on mankind. This is a highly physical performance; we get to see plenty of shots of Branagh's naked torso, emphasising his character's passionate nature. The other outstanding performance comes from Robert De Niro as the Monster, or The Creation as it is referred to here. The Creation is, a hideous, deformed creature, yet at first its impulses are gentle, kindly ones. If is only when it is rejected by humanity that it becomes murderous, vowing revenge on mankind in general and in particular on its creator, who has bestowed upon it the unwanted gift of life. De Niro was an actor who made a sensational start to his career in the seventies, starring in films like "Godfather II" and "Taxi Driver", and although his reputation has perhaps suffered somewhat since as a result of his appearing in too many inferior movies, he nevertheless retains the power to shock us by some electrifying performance. "King of Comedy", "The Mission" and "Cape Fear" were all examples of this power, and "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" is another. He manages the difficult feat of making The Creation both frightful and pitiable. Despite the late eighteenth century setting, this is no work of "heritage drama" in the Merchant/Ivory style. It is rather a visually dark film, one which dwells on the squalor of the past rather than its splendours. Even the scenes set in the elegant Frankenstein family home are rather gloomy; Branagh clearly intended to give it a look which matches the tragic and violent events which make up its plot. (Shelley's novel can be seen as an exercise on Gothic horror as well as pioneering science fiction). Mary Shelley does not perhaps rank as highly in the modern pantheon of English literature as her husband Percy, but she does at least have the distinction of having created in "Frankenstein" one of the great myths of modern times, a story which is known to millions who have never read her original novel. (I am here using the word "myth" in William Golding's sense to mean not a falsehood but a truth which can only be told in the form of a story). The familiarity of that story is, of course, mainly due to the many film adaptations, although it must be said that some of those were not very faithful. Kenneth Branagh, however, deserves credit for making a film which respects the intellectual and philosophical complexity of Shelley's original. I would not rank it quite as highly as some of his great Shakespeare adaptations, notably "Much Ado about Nothing" and "Hamlet", but it runs them a close second. 8/10

    Science versus Religion: The Idea which was Destined to Fail With knowledge comes personal responsibility; the denial of responsibility leads to tragic outcomes. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is a movie about a scientist Victor Frankenstein who becomes obsessed with the idea of creating life after his mother's death, which devastates him. He works hard for a long time until his creation is complete, but the first signs of life in the monster's corpse terrify him and he decides to destroy it. The creature, however, manages to escape from Frankenstein's laboratory which then becomes the start of his agony. After he steps into a real world he is not accepted by society, but on the contrary, is faced humiliation, aversion and reprobation. Thus, all these facts give a start to a tragedy which does not leave anyone indifferent. In my opinion, it is misnomer to call the existence "Monster" as most of us do. I would rather say he is a victim, a pathetic creature - an outcome of human-being's uncontrolled thirst for knowledge. However, as we know, Victor Frankenstein did not pursue anything bad, all he wanted was to reduce human-being's suffering of loss. Initially, his intention was to bring people happiness, because after he lost his mother he felt on himself how it is to lose someone. But unfortunately, he could not accomplish what he desired to accomplish, in fact. He totally failed. In the rest of my essay, I would like to talk about the reasons of his failure. First reason of his failure is the fact that by creating the existence, doctor Frankenstein oversteps all the bounds of morality and deference to God. Moreover, he oversteps all the bounds of science. He was excessively thirsty for knowledge, but that was the limit. Consciously or unconsciously, but by creating the "human-like existence", he automatically becomes omniscient  that is, God-like. However, as we know, from religious perspective, no one except God is allowed to do anything like that, as our protagonist does. In order to realize his crazy idea, Frankenstein sweeps everything away on his road including all aspects of ethics. However, even his idea about creating a human, is out of sanity that can foreshadow his eventual fail. No matter how good and kind Frankenstein's intentions were, his attempts to outreach almighty goes beyond the limit and, in the long run, he pays a very high price to all his deeds. Second reason that leads him to fail is his irresponsibility to his own creature. After creating the being, Frankenstein himself becomes terrified of it. How come it is possible? Is it typical of a father to get scared of his son? When God created us did he show the same attitude to its creatures?  No. After almighty created us we were put into a paradise, where our roots Adam and Eve were supported with everything  shelter, food, work and the most important thing  the Father's love and care. But what the poor existence faces after he is created?  Reprobation. The doctor is the one who creates the creature and he must be the one who should take responsibility for his life. However, as we watched, Frankenstein initially treats his creature as a neuter gender and even does not bother himself to name it. I think if he had taken care of his being and taught him what is good and what is bad, things would have taken completely another turn. And the final reason of such a tragic end is the rejection of "the unnamed" by society. The creature is bitter and dejected after being turned away from human civilization, much the same way that Adam in "Paradise Lost" was turned out of the Garden of Eden. One difference, though, makes the creature a sympathetic character. In the biblical story, Adam causes his own fate by sinning. In this case, Frankenstein causes the creature's hideous existence that leads to the creature's being spurned. Thus, being over and over again rejected by society makes the creature become violent and revengeful. Such a poor, devil-may-care attitude of people to him kills all good traits in him. To conclude, no matter what is the creature like, no matter how good or bad he is, his monstrous appearance would never allow him to grow accustomed to society. He is created to be rejected. It is fact, very bitter fact - the outcome of human-being's irresponsibility and egoism to fulfill its thirst for knowledge. According to Bible, knowledge is considered to be an evil that can destroy the humanity. Just like Eve, doctor Frankenstein reaches for a prohibited knowledge. He goes beyond the limit of a science and morality. He acts against God's rules, which does not lead to anything good, but to a severe punishment.

    Much like "Bram Stoker's Dracula (Coppola produced), here is a stylish, beautifully filmed, & acted update of a classic story. Some people fault Kenneth Branagh for his hyper dramatics, both in the direction, editing, & his acting in this film. I say it was just terrific! Here is a man so obsessed by his mother's death, that he wants nothing less than to bring an end to death! His whirlwind performance is a hypnotizing! A man so possessed by his vision, that it would eventually destroy everyone around him he loves & eventually himself. The most extreme case of irony, of a man who wanted to give life, but in the end brought nothing but death. Robert De Niro. What can I say about his performance as the monster? Not since Boris Karloff's great portrayal, have I seen such pathos, love, & and anger in Frankstein's creation. His interpretation should of at least won him an Oscar nomination. Nothing short of brilliant! "Mary Shelly's Frankenstein" is a film filled with a tornadic vortex of emotions, actions, & circumstance. It is a film that can sweep the viewer in to it's catapulting crescendos & crashes. An emotional roller-coaster ride to one man's oblivion. Profoundly sad, but also, profoundly mesmerizing! Only "the Bride of Frankenstein" matches this film in importance, as a truly transcending film from a classic story, of one man's madness.

    This is a good film but it does NOT follow the Frankenstein story quite well. I think Francis Ford Coppola put a little more effort into his version of Bram Stoker's Dracula than what he put into his adaptation of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. First the deviations from the novel: 1. The creature: In the original novel he had long black hair and did not speak like a Stroke victim. He was actually hyper intelligent and learned exceedingly fast. He was very articulate, perhaps more so than his creator and quoted things like Paradise Lost. In the novel he did not sound like a stroke victim. 2. Elizabeth's heart was not ripped out in the novel. She was strangled. 3. Elizabeth was never brought back in the style of the Frankenstein creature in the novel. For many this is the point where the film jumps the shark. 4. I don't like that this film leaves out the secondary moral of the story. The first moral is always remembered in films that one should not tamper in God's territory, that we should not mess with nature. But what many films forget is the secondary moral, that like a child who had been neglected by a parent the creature had to learn to forgive and that revenge would bring him no peace. I don't know why so many films leave this aspect out. If you want a version of Frankenstein that actually follows Mary Shelley's novel check out the version produced by Hallmark and released to DVD by Lion's Gate starring Luke Goss as the creature. That mini-series version of Frankenstein from 2004 is the most faithful to the book and has (in my opinion) the most sympathetic version of the creature. Now, aside from straying from the novel I will not deny this is a good film, even if some moments are rather hammy and feel as if they were created specifically for the film. This is still an enjoyable movie and does retain the basic ideas behind Mary Shelley's novel. This is a good film with many good actors and special effects that hold up well after nearly twenty years. It's a timeless story and when done correctly the film adaptation is ageless. This was done well. This is one of my top five favorite Frankenstein movies. My favorite Frankenstein films are as follows: 1. The Hallmark version of Frankenstein starring Luke Goss and released through Lion's Gate in 2004. Don't confuse it with any other Frankenstein productions from 2004. Make certain it is the version with Luke Goss as the creature if you choose to watch it. 2. The Bride from 1984. Not to be confused with the more well known "Bride of Frankenstein" this one starred Sting as Baron Frankenstein and Clancy Brown as the creature. This one is a guilty pleasure for me because even though it is cheesy (and very Hammer-esque) it is one of the only versions to have a happy ending for the creature. 3. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. This one is good for it's production values and for drawing attention to the original novel. It's not as faithful as it likes to boast but it is still a good movie. 4. Frankenstein created woman. This is a good one released through Hammer and featuring Peter Cushing as Dr. Frankenstein. This one is cheesy but enjoyable and has all the trappings one expects from a Hammer movie. 5. Frankenstein with Boris Karloff for creating the famous archetype. This 1931 Frankenstein does not follow the book but it is good film and was well made. The image of the creature in this film adaptation with his flat head, bolts in the neck, (apparently) green skin, and elevator shoes is probably the most well known and most associated with the creature even though it's nothing like what Mary Shelley described. 6. Bride of Frankenstein, the sequel to the Karloff version of Frankenestein and directly continues where the 1931 version ended.

    Despite the title, this is not Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein." It's the reanimated corpse of Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein," stitched together with various horror-movie conventions that didn't exist yet in Shelley's time, partly because we've come to know them from other film versions of "Frankenstein." For instance, early in the novel, the 17-year-old Victor Frankenstein begins university and has a couple of quiet office conversations with Professors Krempe and Waldman, neither of whom are medical doctors. He then skips Krempe's lectures and attends only the more inspiring Waldman's. Here, we get the thirty-something (!) Branagh confronting Krempe in a lecture / operating theater, loudly demanding instruction in the ancient theories of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus -- theories that the novel's Victor had already given up on. It's a flashier scene, it's very Hollywood, and it may be "inspired by" Shelley's version, but it nearly reverses the novel's point, scrambling its analysis of how Victor ends up going wrong. The portrayal of the Creature also messes with the story's moral. Yes, he's played for sympathy in a way that's in line with the novel; this may be how Branagh and Coppola convinced themselves that they were doing Shelley's version. But as others here have noted, DeNiro, even with a Bronx accent, is not frightening enough. OK, so he's got some facial scars -- he's not eight feet tall, he doesn't look overpowering, and he seems too obviously decent to suddenly start killing people. Granted, it would be hard even for a great actor to capture the eloquent and well- read yet savage beast that Shelley imagines, but you at least need to make him look frightening enough that we can understand people attacking him and fleeing in terror. The fact that he's "ugly," as he puts it, isn't enough to explain the tragedy. In that regard, a more "traditional" Halloween or horror-movie Frankenstein might actually have served the story better.

    In the nineties films based upon works of literature were commonly given an official title incorporating the name of the author of the work, so this film was at the time often referred to as "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" rather than simply "Frankenstein". There was, apparently, a technical reason for this connected with copyright law, but some viewers and reviewers took this form of title as an indication that the film would be more faithful to the original book than previous attempts to film it had been. Such an expectation was to be disappointed in the case of something like the eccentric "William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet" (definitely Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet rather than Shakespeare's), but here Kenneth Branagh does try and remain more faithful to the original than those old Boris Karloff adaptations from the thirties. (Branagh was so keen on authenticity that he even retained the love between Victor Frankenstein and his adopted sister Elizabeth, something which seems far creepier today, even though they are not related by blood, than it probably did in Shelley's day. The main part of the story takes place in the 1790s, the decade when the French Revolution was at its height, and when revolutionary fervour threatened to overwhelm the rest of Europe. There is no direct reference to these events in the film, but the period is certainly an appropriate one, as young Victor is aiming to bring about a revolution in the scientific sphere far more radical than anything attempted by the likes of Robespierre and Saint-Just in the political sphere. Victor has been obsessed with death ever since his mother died giving birth to his younger brother, and vows that he will use his scientific studies to find a way to conquer death. He comes to believe, from his study of the works of alchemists, that it is possible to create life by artificial means, and persists with his experiments despite the warning of his teacher Professor Waldman that they can only end in disaster. He eventually manages to create a being by piecing together parts from various human corpses and to bring it to life by means of electricity. Branagh not only directed but also starred as Victor, one of two remarkable performances in this film. In this version Frankenstein is not a mad scientist holed up in some spooky old castle, but rather a young student at the University of Ingolstadt. (This was at one time one of the most famous universities in Germany, but it closed in 1799, only a few years after the story is set). Nor is he some nerdy or unworldly intellectual, but rather a passionate young man whose two great passions are his love for Elizabeth and his belief that his work will confer great benefits on mankind. This is a highly physical performance; we get to see plenty of shots of Branagh's naked torso, emphasising his character's passionate nature. The other outstanding performance comes from Robert De Niro as the Monster, or The Creation as it is referred to here. The Creation is, a hideous, deformed creature, yet at first its impulses are gentle, kindly ones. If is only when it is rejected by humanity that it becomes murderous, vowing revenge on mankind in general and in particular on its creator, who has bestowed upon it the unwanted gift of life. De Niro was an actor who made a sensational start to his career in the seventies, starring in films like "Godfather II" and "Taxi Driver", and although his reputation has perhaps suffered somewhat since as a result of his appearing in too many inferior movies, he nevertheless retains the power to shock us by some electrifying performance. "King of Comedy", "The Mission" and "Cape Fear" were all examples of this power, and "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" is another. He manages the difficult feat of making The Creation both frightful and pitiable. Despite the late eighteenth century setting, this is no work of "heritage drama" in the Merchant/Ivory style. It is rather a visually dark film, one which dwells on the squalor of the past rather than its splendours. Even the scenes set in the elegant Frankenstein family home are rather gloomy; Branagh clearly intended to give it a look which matches the tragic and violent events which make up its plot. (Shelley's novel can be seen as an exercise on Gothic horror as well as pioneering science fiction). Mary Shelley does not perhaps rank as highly in the modern pantheon of English literature as her husband Percy, but she does at least have the distinction of having created in "Frankenstein" one of the great myths of modern times, a story which is known to millions who have never read her original novel. (I am here using the word "myth" in William Golding's sense to mean not a falsehood but a truth which can only be told in the form of a story). The familiarity of that story is, of course, mainly due to the many film adaptations, although it must be said that some of those were not very faithful. Kenneth Branagh, however, deserves credit for making a film which respects the intellectual and philosophical complexity of Shelley's original. I would not rank it quite as highly as some of his great Shakespeare adaptations, notably "Much Ado about Nothing" and "Hamlet", but it runs them a close second. 8/10

    Science versus Religion: The Idea which was Destined to Fail With knowledge comes personal responsibility; the denial of responsibility leads to tragic outcomes. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is a movie about a scientist Victor Frankenstein who becomes obsessed with the idea of creating life after his mother's death, which devastates him. He works hard for a long time until his creation is complete, but the first signs of life in the monster's corpse terrify him and he decides to destroy it. The creature, however, manages to escape from Frankenstein's laboratory which then becomes the start of his agony. After he steps into a real world he is not accepted by society, but on the contrary, is faced humiliation, aversion and reprobation. Thus, all these facts give a start to a tragedy which does not leave anyone indifferent. In my opinion, it is misnomer to call the existence "Monster" as most of us do. I would rather say he is a victim, a pathetic creature - an outcome of human-being's uncontrolled thirst for knowledge. However, as we know, Victor Frankenstein did not pursue anything bad, all he wanted was to reduce human-being's suffering of loss. Initially, his intention was to bring people happiness, because after he lost his mother he felt on himself how it is to lose someone. But unfortunately, he could not accomplish what he desired to accomplish, in fact. He totally failed. In the rest of my essay, I would like to talk about the reasons of his failure. First reason of his failure is the fact that by creating the existence, doctor Frankenstein oversteps all the bounds of morality and deference to God. Moreover, he oversteps all the bounds of science. He was excessively thirsty for knowledge, but that was the limit. Consciously or unconsciously, but by creating the "human-like existence", he automatically becomes omniscient  that is, God-like. However, as we know, from religious perspective, no one except God is allowed to do anything like that, as our protagonist does. In order to realize his crazy idea, Frankenstein sweeps everything away on his road including all aspects of ethics. However, even his idea about creating a human, is out of sanity that can foreshadow his eventual fail. No matter how good and kind Frankenstein's intentions were, his attempts to outreach almighty goes beyond the limit and, in the long run, he pays a very high price to all his deeds. Second reason that leads him to fail is his irresponsibility to his own creature. After creating the being, Frankenstein himself becomes terrified of it. How come it is possible? Is it typical of a father to get scared of his son? When God created us did he show the same attitude to its creatures?  No. After almighty created us we were put into a paradise, where our roots Adam and Eve were supported with everything  shelter, food, work and the most important thing  the Father's love and care. But what the poor existence faces after he is created?  Reprobation. The doctor is the one who creates the creature and he must be the one who should take responsibility for his life. However, as we watched, Frankenstein initially treats his creature as a neuter gender and even does not bother himself to name it. I think if he had taken care of his being and taught him what is good and what is bad, things would have taken completely another turn. And the final reason of such a tragic end is the rejection of "the unnamed" by society. The creature is bitter and dejected after being turned away from human civilization, much the same way that Adam in "Paradise Lost" was turned out of the Garden of Eden. One difference, though, makes the creature a sympathetic character. In the biblical story, Adam causes his own fate by sinning. In this case, Frankenstein causes the creature's hideous existence that leads to the creature's being spurned. Thus, being over and over again rejected by society makes the creature become violent and revengeful. Such a poor, devil-may-care attitude of people to him kills all good traits in him. To conclude, no matter what is the creature like, no matter how good or bad he is, his monstrous appearance would never allow him to grow accustomed to society. He is created to be rejected. It is fact, very bitter fact - the outcome of human-being's irresponsibility and egoism to fulfill its thirst for knowledge. According to Bible, knowledge is considered to be an evil that can destroy the humanity. Just like Eve, doctor Frankenstein reaches for a prohibited knowledge. He goes beyond the limit of a science and morality. He acts against God's rules, which does not lead to anything good, but to a severe punishment.

    Much like "Bram Stoker's Dracula (Coppola produced), here is a stylish, beautifully filmed, & acted update of a classic story. Some people fault Kenneth Branagh for his hyper dramatics, both in the direction, editing, & his acting in this film. I say it was just terrific! Here is a man so obsessed by his mother's death, that he wants nothing less than to bring an end to death! His whirlwind performance is a hypnotizing! A man so possessed by his vision, that it would eventually destroy everyone around him he loves & eventually himself. The most extreme case of irony, of a man who wanted to give life, but in the end brought nothing but death. Robert De Niro. What can I say about his performance as the monster? Not since Boris Karloff's great portrayal, have I seen such pathos, love, & and anger in Frankstein's creation. His interpretation should of at least won him an Oscar nomination. Nothing short of brilliant! "Mary Shelly's Frankenstein" is a film filled with a tornadic vortex of emotions, actions, & circumstance. It is a film that can sweep the viewer in to it's catapulting crescendos & crashes. An emotional roller-coaster ride to one man's oblivion. Profoundly sad, but also, profoundly mesmerizing! Only "the Bride of Frankenstein" matches this film in importance, as a truly transcending film from a classic story, of one man's madness.

    This is a good film but it does NOT follow the Frankenstein story quite well. I think Francis Ford Coppola put a little more effort into his version of Bram Stoker's Dracula than what he put into his adaptation of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. First the deviations from the novel: 1. The creature: In the original novel he had long black hair and did not speak like a Stroke victim. He was actually hyper intelligent and learned exceedingly fast. He was very articulate, perhaps more so than his creator and quoted things like Paradise Lost. In the novel he did not sound like a stroke victim. 2. Elizabeth's heart was not ripped out in the novel. She was strangled. 3. Elizabeth was never brought back in the style of the Frankenstein creature in the novel. For many this is the point where the film jumps the shark. 4. I don't like that this film leaves out the secondary moral of the story. The first moral is always remembered in films that one should not tamper in God's territory, that we should not mess with nature. But what many films forget is the secondary moral, that like a child who had been neglected by a parent the creature had to learn to forgive and that revenge would bring him no peace. I don't know why so many films leave this aspect out. If you want a version of Frankenstein that actually follows Mary Shelley's novel check out the version produced by Hallmark and released to DVD by Lion's Gate starring Luke Goss as the creature. That mini-series version of Frankenstein from 2004 is the most faithful to the book and has (in my opinion) the most sympathetic version of the creature. Now, aside from straying from the novel I will not deny this is a good film, even if some moments are rather hammy and feel as if they were created specifically for the film. This is still an enjoyable movie and does retain the basic ideas behind Mary Shelley's novel. This is a good film with many good actors and special effects that hold up well after nearly twenty years. It's a timeless story and when done correctly the film adaptation is ageless. This was done well. This is one of my top five favorite Frankenstein movies. My favorite Frankenstein films are as follows: 1. The Hallmark version of Frankenstein starring Luke Goss and released through Lion's Gate in 2004. Don't confuse it with any other Frankenstein productions from 2004. Make certain it is the version with Luke Goss as the creature if you choose to watch it. 2. The Bride from 1984. Not to be confused with the more well known "Bride of Frankenstein" this one starred Sting as Baron Frankenstein and Clancy Brown as the creature. This one is a guilty pleasure for me because even though it is cheesy (and very Hammer-esque) it is one of the only versions to have a happy ending for the creature. 3. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. This one is good for it's production values and for drawing attention to the original novel. It's not as faithful as it likes to boast but it is still a good movie. 4. Frankenstein created woman. This is a good one released through Hammer and featuring Peter Cushing as Dr. Frankenstein. This one is cheesy but enjoyable and has all the trappings one expects from a Hammer movie. 5. Frankenstein with Boris Karloff for creating the famous archetype. This 1931 Frankenstein does not follow the book but it is good film and was well made. The image of the creature in this film adaptation with his flat head, bolts in the neck, (apparently) green skin, and elevator shoes is probably the most well known and most associated with the creature even though it's nothing like what Mary Shelley described. 6. Bride of Frankenstein, the sequel to the Karloff version of Frankenestein and directly continues where the 1931 version ended.

    Despite the title, this is not Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein." It's the reanimated corpse of Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein," stitched together with various horror-movie conventions that didn't exist yet in Shelley's time, partly because we've come to know them from other film versions of "Frankenstein." For instance, early in the novel, the 17-year-old Victor Frankenstein begins university and has a couple of quiet office conversations with Professors Krempe and Waldman, neither of whom are medical doctors. He then skips Krempe's lectures and attends only the more inspiring Waldman's. Here, we get the thirty-something (!) Branagh confronting Krempe in a lecture / operating theater, loudly demanding instruction in the ancient theories of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus -- theories that the novel's Victor had already given up on. It's a flashier scene, it's very Hollywood, and it may be "inspired by" Shelley's version, but it nearly reverses the novel's point, scrambling its analysis of how Victor ends up going wrong. The portrayal of the Creature also messes with the story's moral. Yes, he's played for sympathy in a way that's in line with the novel; this may be how Branagh and Coppola convinced themselves that they were doing Shelley's version. But as others here have noted, DeNiro, even with a Bronx accent, is not frightening enough. OK, so he's got some facial scars -- he's not eight feet tall, he doesn't look overpowering, and he seems too obviously decent to suddenly start killing people. Granted, it would be hard even for a great actor to capture the eloquent and well- read yet savage beast that Shelley imagines, but you at least need to make him look frightening enough that we can understand people attacking him and fleeing in terror. The fact that he's "ugly," as he puts it, isn't enough to explain the tragedy. In that regard, a more "traditional" Halloween or horror-movie Frankenstein might actually have served the story better. There are other very big changes, especially late in the story, but I won't give them away. If you leave Shelley out of it -- and in fairness, the producers should have left her out of the title -- and if you overlook a number of things that don't make much sense, then it's a glossy and reasonably entertaining version of "Frankenstein." But it's not Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein," it's another in a long line of loose adaptations.

    Beautiful sets, magnificent lighting and a cornucopia of some of the finest actors on the planet cannot save this film from a real dog of a script and appalling direction. People run here, there, and everywhere. Lighting flashes, Nooooooooooo! is yelled and yelled again. Its a dogs dinner of every trope in the business, with much emphasis on "significant" lines from shallowly developed characters and scenes that linger or hinge on some inconsequential point that may have seemed dramatic somewhere, sometime, but not in the final product. It's nearly two hours long, but feels like three and perhaps should have been cut to one. There is little to celebrate save one great shot worthy of note, Victor Frankenstein carrying the body of Elizabeth up a winding staircase of towering RKO magnificence whilst trailing a long blood red cape.

    Victor Frankenstein is inspired to become a doctor by the tragic death of his mother during childbirth. With the help of his mentor's notes and plenty of necessary human parts, he creates an artificial life form. Victor rejects the artificial man he just created due the horrifying outlook of the creature. He tries to kill it and promises to change his own nature for the better. The monster escapes and later swears revenge. Among the many remakes and reboots of horror classics in the 90's, this one was brought to screen by Kenneth Branagh along with superlative actors such as De Niro, Helena Bonham Carter, Ian Holm, John Cleese and Tom Hulce among others. Branagh obviously wanted to class up the epic horror story and so goes for the emotional touch instead of pure horror. Helena and De Niro gave amazing performances, but they are hampered by the hamfisted writing and direction. After a great start to his character where he was totally immersed in it, you can see De Niro almost giving up by the end. Branagh who also plays the lead as Victor Frankenstein is overzealous and an unsympathetic character even when he tries his hardest to make you empathize with him. At the end of the day, the Frankenstein is pretentious, yet flat and uninspiring. There's melodrama and then there's the parody of a melodrama. Unfortunately, this one falls in the latter category even with all its good intentions. There were several times where I unintentionally burst out laughing. I haven't read the novel, but this movie sure doesn't deserve to put up Mary Shelley's name and tarnish her reputation. 4/10

    Kenneth Branagh's film adaptation of Shelley's classic novel, "Frankenstein," is probably more faithful to the novel than other adaptations. Robert DeNiro gave a brilliant performance as the Creature almost unrecognizable. Kenneth Branagh is wonderful as the mad scientist Victor Frankenstein but I was confused by why he abandoned his creation perhaps he realized his abomination. Shelley was way ahead in writing about how man wants to play and be God but not realizing the consequences. The film has a strong supporting cast with recognizable British actors and actresses. Helena Bonham Carter is great as Elizabeth but don't forget Ian Holm as Victor's father or Cherie Lunghi as his mother. The film's quality is first rate but perhaps slow moving at times until the conclusion. Still Branagh is always brilliant especially as Victor Frankenstein.

    To try and show us what a diverse actor he is, Boob Dinero took the part of The Monster in this slapdash version of the Mary Shelley classic. He's kind, he's considerate, he's --- Mr. Nice Guy Frankenstein! Ol' Frankie has noticed that a poor family has no viddles for supper tonight, so The Frankster decides to help out by tearing up a hundred turnips out the frozen ground and leaving them on the family's doorstep..... awwww, that was sweet. I'm sure that's just what they wanted -- to eat turnips until Christmas. If Franky-Wanky is so cool, then why didn't he wash the damn things before he offered them as a gift? Or how come he didn't pull a six-pack of Spam out of the ground so the family could have some meat on their plates? Uninspired (and totally unnecessary) remake. Boob Dinero may be the most over-rated bad actor around. Want proof? See him in 'Awakenings'.... pffft.... now THAT sucked!!

    Forced to Survive in the real world, a man-made creature losses his Child- like innocence and transforms into an adult with bitterness, lust, vengeance - and deadly reasoning. This movie is a great tribute to Mary Shelly's novel. I read the novel when i was a kid, this movie just great, Robert DN plays the awesome monster, who longs for worldly things like normal human after being artificially created - a possible reference to Genetic engineering gone to waste like Terminator seeds (by Monsanto). other references or rip-off made by Time Burton Frankweenie in 1984 i think and then again animation in 2013

The creature is bitter and dejected after being turned away from human civilization, much the same way that Adam in "Paradise Lost" was turned out of the Garden of Eden. One difference, though, makes the creature a sympathetic character. In the biblical story, Adam causes his own fate by sinning. In this case, Frankenstein causes the creature's hideous existence that leads to the creature's being spurned. Thus, being over and over again rejected by society makes the creature become violent and revengeful. Such a poor, devil-may-care attitude of people to him kills all good traits in him. To conclude, no matter what is the creature like, no matter how good or bad he is, his monstrous appearance would never allow him to grow accustomed to society. He is created to be rejected. It is fact, very bitter fact - the outcome of human-being's irresponsibility and egoism to fulfill its thirst for knowledge. According to Bible, knowledge is considered to be an evil that can destroy the humanity. Just like Eve, doctor Frankenstein reaches for a prohibited knowledge. He goes beyond the limit of a science and morality. He acts against God's rules, which does not lead to anything good, but to a severe punishment.

    Much like "Bram Stoker's Dracula (Coppola produced), here is a stylish, beautifully filmed, & acted update of a classic story. Some people fault Kenneth Branagh for his hyper dramatics, both in the direction, editing, & his acting in this film. I say it was just terrific! Here is a man so obsessed by his mother's death, that he wants nothing less than to bring an end to death! His whirlwind performance is a hypnotizing! A man so possessed by his vision, that it would eventually destroy everyone around him he loves & eventually himself. The most extreme case of irony, of a man who wanted to give life, but in the end brought nothing but death. Robert De Niro. What can I say about his performance as the monster? Not since Boris Karloff's great portrayal, have I seen such pathos, love, & and anger in Frankstein's creation. His interpretation should of at least won him an Oscar nomination. Nothing short of brilliant! "Mary Shelly's Frankenstein" is a film filled with a tornadic vortex of emotions, actions, & circumstance. It is a film that can sweep the viewer in to it's catapulting crescendos & crashes. An emotional roller-coaster ride to one man's oblivion. Profoundly sad, but also, profoundly mesmerizing! Only "the Bride of Frankenstein" matches this film in importance, as a truly transcending film from a classic story, of one man's madness.

    This is a good film but it does NOT follow the Frankenstein story quite well. I think Francis Ford Coppola put a little more effort into his version of Bram Stoker's Dracula than what he put into his adaptation of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. First the deviations from the novel: 1. The creature: In the original novel he had long black hair and did not speak like a Stroke victim. He was actually hyper intelligent and learned exceedingly fast. He was very articulate, perhaps more so than his creator and quoted things like Paradise Lost. In the novel he did not sound like a stroke victim. 2. Elizabeth's heart was not ripped out in the novel. She was strangled. 3. Elizabeth was never brought back in the style of the Frankenstein creature in the novel. For many this is the point where the film jumps the shark. 4. I don't like that this film leaves out the secondary moral of the story. The first moral is always remembered in films that one should not tamper in God's territory, that we should not mess with nature. But what many films forget is the secondary moral, that like a child who had been neglected by a parent the creature had to learn to forgive and that revenge would bring him no peace. I don't know why so many films leave this aspect out. If you want a version of Frankenstein that actually follows Mary Shelley's novel check out the version produced by Hallmark and released to DVD by Lion's Gate starring Luke Goss as the creature. That mini-series version of Frankenstein from 2004 is the most faithful to the book and has (in my opinion) the most sympathetic version of the creature. Now, aside from straying from the novel I will not deny this is a good film, even if some moments are rather hammy and feel as if they were created specifically for the film. This is still an enjoyable movie and does retain the basic ideas behind Mary Shelley's novel. This is a good film with many good actors and special effects that hold up well after nearly twenty years. It's a timeless story and when done correctly the film adaptation is ageless. This was done well. This is one of my top five favorite Frankenstein movies. My favorite Frankenstein films are as follows: 1. The Hallmark version of Frankenstein starring Luke Goss and released through Lion's Gate in 2004. Don't confuse it with any other Frankenstein productions from 2004. Make certain it is the version with Luke Goss as the creature if you choose to watch it. 2. The Bride from 1984. Not to be confused with the more well known "Bride of Frankenstein" this one starred Sting as Baron Frankenstein and Clancy Brown as the creature. This one is a guilty pleasure for me because even though it is cheesy (and very Hammer-esque) it is one of the only versions to have a happy ending for the creature. 3. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. This one is good for it's production values and for drawing attention to the original novel. It's not as faithful as it likes to boast but it is still a good movie. 4. Frankenstein created woman. This is a good one released through Hammer and featuring Peter Cushing as Dr. Frankenstein. This one is cheesy but enjoyable and has all the trappings one expects from a Hammer movie. 5. Frankenstein with Boris Karloff for creating the famous archetype. This 1931 Frankenstein does not follow the book but it is good film and was well made. The image of the creature in this film adaptation with his flat head, bolts in the neck, (apparently) green skin, and elevator shoes is probably the most well known and most associated with the creature even though it's nothing like what Mary Shelley described. 6. Bride of Frankenstein, the sequel to the Karloff version of Frankenestein and directly continues where the 1931 version ended.

    Despite the title, this is not Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein." It's the reanimated corpse of Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein," stitched together with various horror-movie conventions that didn't exist yet in Shelley's time, partly because we've come to know them from other film versions of "Frankenstein." For instance, early in the novel, the 17-year-old Victor Frankenstein begins university and has a couple of quiet office conversations with Professors Krempe and Waldman, neither of whom are medical doctors. He then skips Krempe's lectures and attends only the more inspiring Waldman's. Here, we get the thirty-something (!) Branagh confronting Krempe in a lecture / operating theater, loudly demanding instruction in the ancient theories of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus -- theories that the novel's Victor had already given up on. It's a flashier scene, it's very Hollywood, and it may be "inspired by" Shelley's version, but it nearly reverses the novel's point, scrambling its analysis of how Victor ends up going wrong. The portrayal of the Creature also messes with the story's moral. Yes, he's played for sympathy in a way that's in line with the novel; this may be how Branagh and Coppola convinced themselves that they were doing Shelley's version. But as others here have noted, DeNiro, even with a Bronx accent, is not frightening enough. OK, so he's got some facial scars -- he's not eight feet tall, he doesn't look overpowering, and he seems too obviously decent to suddenly start killing people. Granted, it would be hard even for a great actor to capture the eloquent and well- read yet savage beast that Shelley imagines, but you at least need to make him look frightening enough that we can understand people attacking him and fleeing in terror. The fact that he's "ugly," as he puts it, isn't enough to explain the tragedy. In that regard, a more "traditional" Halloween or horror-movie Frankenstein might actually have served the story better. There are other very big changes, especially late in the story, but I won't give them away. If you leave Shelley out of it -- and in fairness, the producers should have left her out of the title -- and if you overlook a number of things that don't make much sense, then it's a glossy and reasonably entertaining version of "Frankenstein." But it's not Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein," it's another in a long line of loose adaptations.

    Beautiful sets, magnificent lighting and a cornucopia of some of the finest actors on the planet cannot save this film from a real dog of a script and appalling direction. People run here, there, and everywhere. Lighting flashes, Nooooooooooo! is yelled and yelled again. Its a dogs dinner of every trope in the business, with much emphasis on "significant" lines from shallowly developed characters and scenes that linger or hinge on some inconsequential point that may have seemed dramatic somewhere, sometime, but not in the final product. It's nearly two hours long, but feels like three and perhaps should have been cut to one. There is little to celebrate save one great shot worthy of note, Victor Frankenstein carrying the body of Elizabeth up a winding staircase of towering RKO magnificence whilst trailing a long blood red cape.

    Victor Frankenstein is inspired to become a doctor by the tragic death of his mother during childbirth. With the help of his mentor's notes and plenty of necessary human parts, he creates an artificial life form. Victor rejects the artificial man he just created due the horrifying outlook of the creature. He tries to kill it and promises to change his own nature for the better. The monster escapes and later swears revenge. Among the many remakes and reboots of horror classics in the 90's, this one was brought to screen by Kenneth Branagh along with superlative actors such as De Niro, Helena Bonham Carter, Ian Holm, John Cleese and Tom Hulce among others. Branagh obviously wanted to class up the epic horror story and so goes for the emotional touch instead of pure horror. Helena and De Niro gave amazing performances, but they are hampered by the hamfisted writing and direction. After a great start to his character where he was totally immersed in it, you can see De Niro almost giving up by the end. Branagh who also plays the lead as Victor Frankenstein is overzealous and an unsympathetic character even when he tries his hardest to make you empathize with him. At the end of the day, the Frankenstein is pretentious, yet flat and uninspiring. There's melodrama and then there's the parody of a melodrama. Unfortunately, this one falls in the latter category even with all its good intentions. There were several times where I unintentionally burst out laughing. I haven't read the novel, but this movie sure doesn't deserve to put up Mary Shelley's name and tarnish her reputation. 4/10

    Kenneth Branagh's film adaptation of Shelley's classic novel, "Frankenstein," is probably more faithful to the novel than other adaptations. Robert DeNiro gave a brilliant performance as the Creature almost unrecognizable. Kenneth Branagh is wonderful as the mad scientist Victor Frankenstein but I was confused by why he abandoned his creation perhaps he realized his abomination. Shelley was way ahead in writing about how man wants to play and be God but not realizing the consequences. The film has a strong supporting cast with recognizable British actors and actresses. Helena Bonham Carter is great as Elizabeth but don't forget Ian Holm as Victor's father or Cherie Lunghi as his mother. The film's quality is first rate but perhaps slow moving at times until the conclusion. Still Branagh is always brilliant especially as Victor Frankenstein.

    To try and show us what a diverse actor he is, Boob Dinero took the part of The Monster in this slapdash version of the Mary Shelley classic. He's kind, he's considerate, he's --- Mr. Nice Guy Frankenstein! Ol' Frankie has noticed that a poor family has no viddles for supper tonight, so The Frankster decides to help out by tearing up a hundred turnips out the frozen ground and leaving them on the family's doorstep..... awwww, that was sweet. I'm sure that's just what they wanted -- to eat turnips until Christmas. If Franky-Wanky is so cool, then why didn't he wash the damn things before he offered them as a gift? Or how come he didn't pull a six-pack of Spam out of the ground so the family could have some meat on their plates? Uninspired (and totally unnecessary) remake. Boob Dinero may be the most over-rated bad actor around. Want proof? See him in 'Awakenings'.... pffft.... now THAT sucked!!

    Forced to Survive in the real world, a man-made creature losses his Child- like innocence and transforms into an adult with bitterness, lust, vengeance - and deadly reasoning. This movie is a great tribute to Mary Shelly's novel. I read the novel when i was a kid, this movie just great, Robert DN plays the awesome monster, who longs for worldly things like normal human after being artificially created - a possible reference to Genetic engineering gone to waste like Terminator seeds (by Monsanto). other references or rip-off made by Time Burton Frankweenie in 1984 i think and then again animation in 2013

    In the nineties films based upon works of literature were commonly given an official title incorporating the name of the author of the work, so this film was at the time often referred to as "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" rather than simply "Frankenstein". There was, apparently, a technical reason for this connected with copyright law, but some viewers and reviewers took this form of title as an indication that the film would be more faithful to the original book than previous attempts to film it had been. Such an expectation was to be disappointed in the case of something like the eccentric "William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet" (definitely Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet rather than Shakespeare's), but here Kenneth Branagh does try and remain more faithful to the original than those old Boris Karloff adaptations from the thirties. (Branagh was so keen on authenticity that he even retained the love between Victor Frankenstein and his adopted sister Elizabeth, something which seems far creepier today, even though they are not related by blood, than it probably did in Shelley's day. The main part of the story takes place in the 1790s, the decade when the French Revolution was at its height, and when revolutionary fervour threatened to overwhelm the rest of Europe. There is no direct reference to these events in the film, but the period is certainly an appropriate one, as young Victor is aiming to bring about a revolution in the scientific sphere far more radical than anything attempted by the likes of Robespierre and Saint-Just in the political sphere. Victor has been obsessed with death ever since his mother died giving birth to his younger brother, and vows that he will use his scientific studies to find a way to conquer death. He comes to believe, from his study of the works of alchemists, that it is possible to create life by artificial means, and persists with his experiments despite the warning of his teacher Professor Waldman that they can only end in disaster. He eventually manages to create a being by piecing together parts from various human corpses and to bring it to life by means of electricity. Branagh not only directed but also starred as Victor, one of two remarkable performances in this film. In this version Frankenstein is not a mad scientist holed up in some spooky old castle, but rather a young student at the University of Ingolstadt. (This was at one time one of the most famous universities in Germany, but it closed in 1799, only a few years after the story is set). Nor is he some nerdy or unworldly intellectual, but rather a passionate young man whose two great passions are his love for Elizabeth and his belief that his work will confer great benefits on mankind. This is a highly physical performance; we get to see plenty of shots of Branagh's naked torso, emphasising his character's passionate nature. The other outstanding performance comes from Robert De Niro as the Monster, or The Creation as it is referred to here. The Creation is, a hideous, deformed creature, yet at first its impulses are gentle, kindly ones. If is only when it is rejected by humanity that it becomes murderous, vowing revenge on mankind in general and in particular on its creator, who has bestowed upon it the unwanted gift of life. De Niro was an actor who made a sensational start to his career in the seventies, starring in films like "Godfather II" and "Taxi Driver", and although his reputation has perhaps suffered somewhat since as a result of his appearing in too many inferior movies, he nevertheless retains the power to shock us by some electrifying performance. "King of Comedy", "The Mission" and "Cape Fear" were all examples of this power, and "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" is another. He manages the difficult feat of making The Creation both frightful and pitiable. Despite the late eighteenth century setting, this is no work of "heritage drama" in the Merchant/Ivory style. It is rather a visually dark film, one which dwells on the squalor of the past rather than its splendours. Even the scenes set in the elegant Frankenstein family home are rather gloomy; Branagh clearly intended to give it a look which matches the tragic and violent events which make up its plot. (Shelley's novel can be seen as an exercise on Gothic horror as well as pioneering science fiction). Mary Shelley does not perhaps rank as highly in the modern pantheon of English literature as her husband Percy, but she does at least have the distinction of having created in "Frankenstein" one of the great myths of modern times, a story which is known to millions who have never read her original novel. (I am here using the word "myth" in William Golding's sense to mean not a falsehood but a truth which can only be told in the form of a story). The familiarity of that story is, of course, mainly due to the many film adaptations, although it must be said that some of those were not very faithful. Kenneth Branagh, however, deserves credit for making a film which respects the intellectual and philosophical complexity of Shelley's original. I would not rank it quite as highly as some of his great Shakespeare adaptations, notably "Much Ado about Nothing" and "Hamlet", but it runs them a close second. 8/10

    Science versus Religion: The Idea which was Destined to Fail With knowledge comes personal responsibility; the denial of responsibility leads to tragic outcomes. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is a movie about a scientist Victor Frankenstein who becomes obsessed with the idea of creating life after his mother's death, which devastates him. He works hard for a long time until his creation is complete, but the first signs of life in the monster's corpse terrify him and he decides to destroy it. The creature, however, manages to escape from Frankenstein's laboratory which then becomes the start of his agony. After he steps into a real world he is not accepted by society, but on the contrary, is faced humiliation, aversion and reprobation. Thus, all these facts give a start to a tragedy which does not leave anyone indifferent. In my opinion, it is misnomer to call the existence "Monster" as most of us do. I would rather say he is a victim, a pathetic creature - an outcome of human-being's uncontrolled thirst for knowledge. However, as we know, Victor Frankenstein did not pursue anything bad, all he wanted was to reduce human-being's suffering of loss. Initially, his intention was to bring people happiness, because after he lost his mother he felt on himself how it is to lose someone. But unfortunately, he could not accomplish what he desired to accomplish, in fact. He totally failed. In the rest of my essay, I would like to talk about the reasons of his failure. First reason of his failure is the fact that by creating the existence, doctor Frankenstein oversteps all the bounds of morality and deference to God. Moreover, he oversteps all the bounds of science. He was excessively thirsty for knowledge, but that was the limit. Consciously or unconsciously, but by creating the "human-like existence", he automatically becomes omniscient  that is, God-like. However, as we know, from religious perspective, no one except God is allowed to do anything like that, as our protagonist does. In order to realize his crazy idea, Frankenstein sweeps everything away on his road including all aspects of ethics. However, even his idea about creating a human, is out of sanity that can foreshadow his eventual fail. No matter how good and kind Frankenstein's intentions were, his attempts to outreach almighty goes beyond the limit and, in the long run, he pays a very high price to all his deeds. Second reason that leads him to fail is his irresponsibility to his own creature. After creating the being, Frankenstein himself becomes terrified of it. How come it is possible? Is it typical of a father to get scared of his son? When God created us did he show the same attitude to its creatures?  No. After almighty created us we were put into a paradise, where our roots Adam and Eve were supported with everything  shelter, food, work and the most important thing  the Father's love and care. But what the poor existence faces after he is created?  Reprobation. The doctor is the one who creates the creature and he must be the one who should take responsibility for his life. However, as we watched, Frankenstein initially treats his creature as a neuter gender and even does not bother himself to name it. I think if he had taken care of his being and taught him what is good and what is bad, things would have taken completely another turn. And the final reason of such a tragic end is the rejection of "the unnamed" by society. The creature is bitter and dejected after being turned away from human civilization, much the same way that Adam in "Paradise Lost" was turned out of the Garden of Eden. One difference, though, makes the creature a sympathetic character. In the biblical story, Adam causes his own fate by sinning. In this case, Frankenstein causes the creature's hideous existence that leads to the creature's being spurned. Thus, being over and over again rejected by society makes the creature become violent and revengeful. Such a poor, devil-may-care attitude of people to him kills all good traits in him. To conclude, no matter what is the creature like, no matter how good or bad he is, his monstrous appearance would never allow him to grow accustomed to society. He is created to be rejected. It is fact, very bitter fact - the outcome of human-being's irresponsibility and egoism to fulfill its thirst for knowledge. According to Bible, knowledge is considered to be an evil that can destroy the humanity. Just like Eve, doctor Frankenstein reaches for a prohibited knowledge. He goes beyond the limit of a science and morality. He acts against God's rules, which does not lead to anything good, but to a severe punishment.

It's a flashier scene, it's very Hollywood, and it may be "inspired by" Shelley's version, but it nearly reverses the novel's point, scrambling its analysis of how Victor ends up going wrong. The portrayal of the Creature also messes with the story's moral. Yes, he's played for sympathy in a way that's in line with the novel; this may be how Branagh and Coppola convinced themselves that they were doing Shelley's version. But as others here have noted, DeNiro, even with a Bronx accent, is not frightening enough. OK, so he's got some facial scars -- he's not eight feet tall, he doesn't look overpowering, and he seems too obviously decent to suddenly start killing people. Granted, it would be hard even for a great actor to capture the eloquent and well- read yet savage beast that Shelley imagines, but you at least need to make him look frightening enough that we can understand people attacking him and fleeing in terror. The fact that he's "ugly," as he puts it, isn't enough to explain the tragedy. In that regard, a more "traditional" Halloween or horror-movie Frankenstein might actually have served the story better. There are other very big changes, especially late in the story, but I won't give them away. If you leave Shelley out of it -- and in fairness, the producers should have left her out of the title -- and if you overlook a number of things that don't make much sense, then it's a glossy and reasonably entertaining version of "Frankenstein." But it's not Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein," it's another in a long line of loose adaptations.

    Beautiful sets, magnificent lighting and a cornucopia of some of the finest actors on the planet cannot save this film from a real dog of a script and appalling direction. People run here, there, and everywhere. Lighting flashes, Nooooooooooo! is yelled and yelled again. Its a dogs dinner of every trope in the business, with much emphasis on "significant" lines from shallowly developed characters and scenes that linger or hinge on some inconsequential point that may have seemed dramatic somewhere, sometime, but not in the final product. It's nearly two hours long, but feels like three and perhaps should have been cut to one. There is little to celebrate save one great shot worthy of note, Victor Frankenstein carrying the body of Elizabeth up a winding staircase of towering RKO magnificence whilst trailing a long blood red cape.

    Victor Frankenstein is inspired to become a doctor by the tragic death of his mother during childbirth. With the help of his mentor's notes and plenty of necessary human parts, he creates an artificial life form. Victor rejects the artificial man he just created due the horrifying outlook of the creature. He tries to kill it and promises to change his own nature for the better. The monster escapes and later swears revenge. Among the many remakes and reboots of horror classics in the 90's, this one was brought to screen by Kenneth Branagh along with superlative actors such as De Niro, Helena Bonham Carter, Ian Holm, John Cleese and Tom Hulce among others. Branagh obviously wanted to class up the epic horror story and so goes for the emotional touch instead of pure horror. Helena and De Niro gave amazing performances, but they are hampered by the hamfisted writing and direction. After a great start to his character where he was totally immersed in it, you can see De Niro almost giving up by the end. Branagh who also plays the lead as Victor Frankenstein is overzealous and an unsympathetic character even when he tries his hardest to make you empathize with him. At the end of the day, the Frankenstein is pretentious, yet flat and uninspiring. There's melodrama and then there's the parody of a melodrama. Unfortunately, this one falls in the latter category even with all its good intentions. There were several times where I unintentionally burst out laughing. I haven't read the novel, but this movie sure doesn't deserve to put up Mary Shelley's name and tarnish her reputation. 4/10

    Kenneth Branagh's film adaptation of Shelley's classic novel, "Frankenstein," is probably more faithful to the novel than other adaptations. Robert DeNiro gave a brilliant performance as the Creature almost unrecognizable. Kenneth Branagh is wonderful as the mad scientist Victor Frankenstein but I was confused by why he abandoned his creation perhaps he realized his abomination. Shelley was way ahead in writing about how man wants to play and be God but not realizing the consequences. The film has a strong supporting cast with recognizable British actors and actresses. Helena Bonham Carter is great as Elizabeth but don't forget Ian Holm as Victor's father or Cherie Lunghi as his mother. The film's quality is first rate but perhaps slow moving at times until the conclusion. Still Branagh is always brilliant especially as Victor Frankenstein.

    To try and show us what a diverse actor he is, Boob Dinero took the part of The Monster in this slapdash version of the Mary Shelley classic. He's kind, he's considerate, he's --- Mr. Nice Guy Frankenstein! Ol' Frankie has noticed that a poor family has no viddles for supper tonight, so The Frankster decides to help out by tearing up a hundred turnips out the frozen ground and leaving them on the family's doorstep..... awwww, that was sweet. I'm sure that's just what they wanted -- to eat turnips until Christmas. If Franky-Wanky is so cool, then why didn't he wash the damn things before he offered them as a gift? Or how come he didn't pull a six-pack of Spam out of the ground so the family could have some meat on their plates? Uninspired (and totally unnecessary) remake. Boob Dinero may be the most over-rated bad actor around. Want proof? See him in 'Awakenings'.... pffft.... now THAT sucked!!

    In the nineties films based upon works of literature were commonly given an official title incorporating the name of the author of the work, so this film was at the time often referred to as "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" rather than simply "Frankenstein". There was, apparently, a technical reason for this connected with copyright law, but some viewers and reviewers took this form of title as an indication that the film would be more faithful to the original book than previous attempts to film it had been. Such an expectation was to be disappointed in the case of something like the eccentric "William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet" (definitely Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet rather than Shakespeare's), but here Kenneth Branagh does try and remain more faithful to the original than those old Boris Karloff adaptations from the thirties. (Branagh was so keen on authenticity that he even retained the love between Victor Frankenstein and his adopted sister Elizabeth, something which seems far creepier today, even though they are not related by blood, than it probably did in Shelley's day. The main part of the story takes place in the 1790s, the decade when the French Revolution was at its height, and when revolutionary fervour threatened to overwhelm the rest of Europe. There is no direct reference to these events in the film, but the period is certainly an appropriate one, as young Victor is aiming to bring about a revolution in the scientific sphere far more radical than anything attempted by the likes of Robespierre and Saint-Just in the political sphere. Victor has been obsessed with death ever since his mother died giving birth to his younger brother, and vows that he will use his scientific studies to find a way to conquer death. He comes to believe, from his study of the works of alchemists, that it is possible to create life by artificial means, and persists with his experiments despite the warning of his teacher Professor Waldman that they can only end in disaster. He eventually manages to create a being by piecing together parts from various human corpses and to bring it to life by means of electricity. Branagh not only directed but also starred as Victor, one of two remarkable performances in this film. In this version Frankenstein is not a mad scientist holed up in some spooky old castle, but rather a young student at the University of Ingolstadt. (This was at one time one of the most famous universities in Germany, but it closed in 1799, only a few years after the story is set). Nor is he some nerdy or unworldly intellectual, but rather a passionate young man whose two great passions are his love for Elizabeth and his belief that his work will confer great benefits on mankind. This is a highly physical performance; we get to see plenty of shots of Branagh's naked torso, emphasising his character's passionate nature. The other outstanding performance comes from Robert De Niro as the Monster, or The Creation as it is referred to here. The Creation is, a hideous, deformed creature, yet at first its impulses are gentle, kindly ones. If is only when it is rejected by humanity that it becomes murderous, vowing revenge on mankind in general and in particular on its creator, who has bestowed upon it the unwanted gift of life. De Niro was an actor who made a sensational start to his career in the seventies, starring in films like "Godfather II" and "Taxi Driver", and although his reputation has perhaps suffered somewhat since as a result of his appearing in too many inferior movies, he nevertheless retains the power to shock us by some electrifying performance. "King of Comedy", "The Mission" and "Cape Fear" were all examples of this power, and "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" is another. He manages the difficult feat of making The Creation both frightful and pitiable. Despite the late eighteenth century setting, this is no work of "heritage drama" in the Merchant/Ivory style. It is rather a visually dark film, one which dwells on the squalor of the past rather than its splendours. Even the scenes set in the elegant Frankenstein family home are rather gloomy; Branagh clearly intended to give it a look which matches the tragic and violent events which make up its plot. (Shelley's novel can be seen as an exercise on Gothic horror as well as pioneering science fiction). Mary Shelley does not perhaps rank as highly in the modern pantheon of English literature as her husband Percy, but she does at least have the distinction of having created in "Frankenstein" one of the great myths of modern times, a story which is known to millions who have never read her original novel. (I am here using the word "myth" in William Golding's sense to mean not a falsehood but a truth which can only be told in the form of a story). The familiarity of that story is, of course, mainly due to the many film adaptations, although it must be said that some of those were not very faithful. Kenneth Branagh, however, deserves credit for making a film which respects the intellectual and philosophical complexity of Shelley's original. I would not rank it quite as highly as some of his great Shakespeare adaptations, notably "Much Ado about Nothing" and "Hamlet", but it runs them a close second. 8/10

    Science versus Religion: The Idea which was Destined to Fail With knowledge comes personal responsibility; the denial of responsibility leads to tragic outcomes. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is a movie about a scientist Victor Frankenstein who becomes obsessed with the idea of creating life after his mother's death, which devastates him. He works hard for a long time until his creation is complete, but the first signs of life in the monster's corpse terrify him and he decides to destroy it. The creature, however, manages to escape from Frankenstein's laboratory which then becomes the start of his agony. After he steps into a real world he is not accepted by society, but on the contrary, is faced humiliation, aversion and reprobation. Thus, all these facts give a start to a tragedy which does not leave anyone indifferent. In my opinion, it is misnomer to call the existence "Monster" as most of us do. I would rather say he is a victim, a pathetic creature - an outcome of human-being's uncontrolled thirst for knowledge. However, as we know, Victor Frankenstein did not pursue anything bad, all he wanted was to reduce human-being's suffering of loss. Initially, his intention was to bring people happiness, because after he lost his mother he felt on himself how it is to lose someone. But unfortunately, he could not accomplish what he desired to accomplish, in fact. He totally failed. In the rest of my essay, I would like to talk about the reasons of his failure. First reason of his failure is the fact that by creating the existence, doctor Frankenstein oversteps all the bounds of morality and deference to God. Moreover, he oversteps all the bounds of science. He was excessively thirsty for knowledge, but that was the limit. Consciously or unconsciously, but by creating the "human-like existence", he automatically becomes omniscient  that is, God-like. However, as we know, from religious perspective, no one except God is allowed to do anything like that, as our protagonist does. In order to realize his crazy idea, Frankenstein sweeps everything away on his road including all aspects of ethics. However, even his idea about creating a human, is out of sanity that can foreshadow his eventual fail. No matter how good and kind Frankenstein's intentions were, his attempts to outreach almighty goes beyond the limit and, in the long run, he pays a very high price to all his deeds. Second reason that leads him to fail is his irresponsibility to his own creature. After creating the being, Frankenstein himself becomes terrified of it. How come it is possible? Is it typical of a father to get scared of his son? When God created us did he show the same attitude to its creatures?  No. After almighty created us we were put into a paradise, where our roots Adam and Eve were supported with everything  shelter, food, work and the most important thing  the Father's love and care. But what the poor existence faces after he is created?  Reprobation. The doctor is the one who creates the creature and he must be the one who should take responsibility for his life. However, as we watched, Frankenstein initially treats his creature as a neuter gender and even does not bother himself to name it. I think if he had taken care of his being and taught him what is good and what is bad, things would have taken completely another turn. And the final reason of such a tragic end is the rejection of "the unnamed" by society. The creature is bitter and dejected after being turned away from human civilization, much the same way that Adam in "Paradise Lost" was turned out of the Garden of Eden. One difference, though, makes the creature a sympathetic character. In the biblical story, Adam causes his own fate by sinning. In this case, Frankenstein causes the creature's hideous existence that leads to the creature's being spurned. Thus, being over and over again rejected by society makes the creature become violent and revengeful. Such a poor, devil-may-care attitude of people to him kills all good traits in him. To conclude, no matter what is the creature like, no matter how good or bad he is, his monstrous appearance would never allow him to grow accustomed to society. He is created to be rejected. It is fact, very bitter fact - the outcome of human-being's irresponsibility and egoism to fulfill its thirst for knowledge. According to Bible, knowledge is considered to be an evil that can destroy the humanity. Just like Eve, doctor Frankenstein reaches for a prohibited knowledge. He goes beyond the limit of a science and morality. He acts against God's rules, which does not lead to anything good, but to a severe punishment.

    Much like "Bram Stoker's Dracula (Coppola produced), here is a stylish, beautifully filmed, & acted update of a classic story. Some people fault Kenneth Branagh for his hyper dramatics, both in the direction, editing, & his acting in this film. I say it was just terrific! Here is a man so obsessed by his mother's death, that he wants nothing less than to bring an end to death! His whirlwind performance is a hypnotizing! A man so possessed by his vision, that it would eventually destroy everyone around him he loves & eventually himself. The most extreme case of irony, of a man who wanted to give life, but in the end brought nothing but death. Robert De Niro. What can I say about his performance as the monster? Not since Boris Karloff's great portrayal, have I seen such pathos, love, & and anger in Frankstein's creation. His interpretation should of at least won him an Oscar nomination. Nothing short of brilliant! "Mary Shelly's Frankenstein" is a film filled with a tornadic vortex of emotions, actions, & circumstance. It is a film that can sweep the viewer in to it's catapulting crescendos & crashes. An emotional roller-coaster ride to one man's oblivion. Profoundly sad, but also, profoundly mesmerizing! Only "the Bride of Frankenstein" matches this film in importance, as a truly transcending film from a classic story, of one man's madness.

    This is a good film but it does NOT follow the Frankenstein story quite well. I think Francis Ford Coppola put a little more effort into his version of Bram Stoker's Dracula than what he put into his adaptation of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. First the deviations from the novel: 1. The creature: In the original novel he had long black hair and did not speak like a Stroke victim. He was actually hyper intelligent and learned exceedingly fast. He was very articulate, perhaps more so than his creator and quoted things like Paradise Lost. In the novel he did not sound like a stroke victim. 2. Elizabeth's heart was not ripped out in the novel. She was strangled. 3. Elizabeth was never brought back in the style of the Frankenstein creature in the novel. For many this is the point where the film jumps the shark. 4. I don't like that this film leaves out the secondary moral of the story. The first moral is always remembered in films that one should not tamper in God's territory, that we should not mess with nature. But what many films forget is the secondary moral, that like a child who had been neglected by a parent the creature had to learn to forgive and that revenge would bring him no peace. I don't know why so many films leave this aspect out. If you want a version of Frankenstein that actually follows Mary Shelley's novel check out the version produced by Hallmark and released to DVD by Lion's Gate starring Luke Goss as the creature. That mini-series version of Frankenstein from 2004 is the most faithful to the book and has (in my opinion) the most sympathetic version of the creature. Now, aside from straying from the novel I will not deny this is a good film, even if some moments are rather hammy and feel as if they were created specifically for the film. This is still an enjoyable movie and does retain the basic ideas behind Mary Shelley's novel. This is a good film with many good actors and special effects that hold up well after nearly twenty years. It's a timeless story and when done correctly the film adaptation is ageless. This was done well. This is one of my top five favorite Frankenstein movies. My favorite Frankenstein films are as follows: 1. The Hallmark version of Frankenstein starring Luke Goss and released through Lion's Gate in 2004. Don't confuse it with any other Frankenstein productions from 2004. Make certain it is the version with Luke Goss as the creature if you choose to watch it. 2. The Bride from 1984. Not to be confused with the more well known "Bride of Frankenstein" this one starred Sting as Baron Frankenstein and Clancy Brown as the creature. This one is a guilty pleasure for me because even though it is cheesy (and very Hammer-esque) it is one of the only versions to have a happy ending for the creature. 3. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. This one is good for it's production values and for drawing attention to the original novel. It's not as faithful as it likes to boast but it is still a good movie. 4. Frankenstein created woman. This is a good one released through Hammer and featuring Peter Cushing as Dr. Frankenstein. This one is cheesy but enjoyable and has all the trappings one expects from a Hammer movie. 5. Frankenstein with Boris Karloff for creating the famous archetype. This 1931 Frankenstein does not follow the book but it is good film and was well made. The image of the creature in this film adaptation with his flat head, bolts in the neck, (apparently) green skin, and elevator shoes is probably the most well known and most associated with the creature even though it's nothing like what Mary Shelley described. 6. Bride of Frankenstein, the sequel to the Karloff version of Frankenestein and directly continues where the 1931 version ended.

    Despite the title, this is not Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein." It's the reanimated corpse of Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein," stitched together with various horror-movie conventions that didn't exist yet in Shelley's time, partly because we've come to know them from other film versions of "Frankenstein." For instance, early in the novel, the 17-year-old Victor Frankenstein begins university and has a couple of quiet office conversations with Professors Krempe and Waldman, neither of whom are medical doctors. He then skips Krempe's lectures and attends only the more inspiring Waldman's. Here, we get the thirty-something (!) Branagh confronting Krempe in a lecture / operating theater, loudly demanding instruction in the ancient theories of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus -- theories that the novel's Victor had already given up on. It's a flashier scene, it's very Hollywood, and it may be "inspired by" Shelley's version, but it nearly reverses the novel's point, scrambling its analysis of how Victor ends up going wrong.

    In the nineties films based upon works of literature were commonly given an official title incorporating the name of the author of the work, so this film was at the time often referred to as "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" rather than simply "Frankenstein". There was, apparently, a technical reason for this connected with copyright law, but some viewers and reviewers took this form of title as an indication that the film would be more faithful to the original book than previous attempts to film it had been. Such an expectation was to be disappointed in the case of something like the eccentric "William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet" (definitely Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet rather than Shakespeare's), but here Kenneth Branagh does try and remain more faithful to the original than those old Boris Karloff adaptations from the thirties. (Branagh was so keen on authenticity that he even retained the love between Victor Frankenstein and his adopted sister Elizabeth, something which seems far creepier today, even though they are not related by blood, than it probably did in Shelley's day. The main part of the story takes place in the 1790s, the decade when the French Revolution was at its height, and when revolutionary fervour threatened to overwhelm the rest of Europe. There is no direct reference to these events in the film, but the period is certainly an appropriate one, as young Victor is aiming to bring about a revolution in the scientific sphere far more radical than anything attempted by the likes of Robespierre and Saint-Just in the political sphere. Victor has been obsessed with death ever since his mother died giving birth to his younger brother, and vows that he will use his scientific studies to find a way to conquer death. He comes to believe, from his study of the works of alchemists, that it is possible to create life by artificial means, and persists with his experiments despite the warning of his teacher Professor Waldman that they can only end in disaster. He eventually manages to create a being by piecing together parts from various human corpses and to bring it to life by means of electricity. Branagh not only directed but also starred as Victor, one of two remarkable performances in this film. In this version Frankenstein is not a mad scientist holed up in some spooky old castle, but rather a young student at the University of Ingolstadt. (This was at one time one of the most famous universities in Germany, but it closed in 1799, only a few years after the story is set). Nor is he some nerdy or unworldly intellectual, but rather a passionate young man whose two great passions are his love for Elizabeth and his belief that his work will confer great benefits on mankind. This is a highly physical performance; we get to see plenty of shots of Branagh's naked torso, emphasising his character's passionate nature. The other outstanding performance comes from Robert De Niro as the Monster, or The Creation as it is referred to here. The Creation is, a hideous, deformed creature, yet at first its impulses are gentle, kindly ones. If is only when it is rejected by humanity that it becomes murderous, vowing revenge on mankind in general and in particular on its creator, who has bestowed upon it the unwanted gift of life. De Niro was an actor who made a sensational start to his career in the seventies, starring in films like "Godfather II" and "Taxi Driver", and although his reputation has perhaps suffered somewhat since as a result of his appearing in too many inferior movies, he nevertheless retains the power to shock us by some electrifying performance. "King of Comedy", "The Mission" and "Cape Fear" were all examples of this power, and "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" is another. He manages the difficult feat of making The Creation both frightful and pitiable. Despite the late eighteenth century setting, this is no work of "heritage drama" in the Merchant/Ivory style. It is rather a visually dark film, one which dwells on the squalor of the past rather than its splendours. Even the scenes set in the elegant Frankenstein family home are rather gloomy; Branagh clearly intended to give it a look which matches the tragic and violent events which make up its plot. (Shelley's novel can be seen as an exercise on Gothic horror as well as pioneering science fiction). Mary Shelley does not perhaps rank as highly in the modern pantheon of English literature as her husband Percy, but she does at least have the distinction of having created in "Frankenstein" one of the great myths of modern times, a story which is known to millions who have never read her original novel. (I am here using the word "myth" in William Golding's sense to mean not a falsehood but a truth which can only be told in the form of a story). The familiarity of that story is, of course, mainly due to the many film adaptations, although it must be said that some of those were not very faithful. Kenneth Branagh, however, deserves credit for making a film which respects the intellectual and philosophical complexity of Shelley's original. I would not rank it quite as highly as some of his great Shakespeare adaptations, notably "Much Ado about Nothing" and "Hamlet", but it runs them a close second. 8/10

    Science versus Religion: The Idea which was Destined to Fail With knowledge comes personal responsibility; the denial of responsibility leads to tragic outcomes. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is a movie about a scientist Victor Frankenstein who becomes obsessed with the idea of creating life after his mother's death, which devastates him. He works hard for a long time until his creation is complete, but the first signs of life in the monster's corpse terrify him and he decides to destroy it. The creature, however, manages to escape from Frankenstein's laboratory which then becomes the start of his agony. After he steps into a real world he is not accepted by society, but on the contrary, is faced humiliation, aversion and reprobation. Thus, all these facts give a start to a tragedy which does not leave anyone indifferent. In my opinion, it is misnomer to call the existence "Monster" as most of us do. I would rather say he is a victim, a pathetic creature - an outcome of human-being's uncontrolled thirst for knowledge. However, as we know, Victor Frankenstein did not pursue anything bad, all he wanted was to reduce human-being's suffering of loss. Initially, his intention was to bring people happiness, because after he lost his mother he felt on himself how it is to lose someone. But unfortunately, he could not accomplish what he desired to accomplish, in fact. He totally failed. In the rest of my essay, I would like to talk about the reasons of his failure. First reason of his failure is the fact that by creating the existence, doctor Frankenstein oversteps all the bounds of morality and deference to God. Moreover, he oversteps all the bounds of science. He was excessively thirsty for knowledge, but that was the limit. Consciously or unconsciously, but by creating the "human-like existence", he automatically becomes omniscient  that is, God-like. However, as we know, from religious perspective, no one except God is allowed to do anything like that, as our protagonist does. In order to realize his crazy idea, Frankenstein sweeps everything away on his road including all aspects of ethics. However, even his idea about creating a human, is out of sanity that can foreshadow his eventual fail. No matter how good and kind Frankenstein's intentions were, his attempts to outreach almighty goes beyond the limit and, in the long run, he pays a very high price to all his deeds. Second reason that leads him to fail is his irresponsibility to his own creature. After creating the being, Frankenstein himself becomes terrified of it. How come it is possible? Is it typical of a father to get scared of his son? When God created us did he show the same attitude to its creatures?  No. After almighty created us we were put into a paradise, where our roots Adam and Eve were supported with everything  shelter, food, work and the most important thing  the Father's love and care. But what the poor existence faces after he is created?  Reprobation. The doctor is the one who creates the creature and he must be the one who should take responsibility for his life. However, as we watched, Frankenstein initially treats his creature as a neuter gender and even does not bother himself to name it. I think if he had taken care of his being and taught him what is good and what is bad, things would have taken completely another turn. And the final reason of such a tragic end is the rejection of "the unnamed" by society. The creature is bitter and dejected after being turned away from human civilization, much the same way that Adam in "Paradise Lost" was turned out of the Garden of Eden. One difference, though, makes the creature a sympathetic character. In the biblical story, Adam causes his own fate by sinning. In this case, Frankenstein causes the creature's hideous existence that leads to the creature's being spurned. Thus, being over and over again rejected by society makes the creature become violent and revengeful. Such a poor, devil-may-care attitude of people to him kills all good traits in him. To conclude, no matter what is the creature like, no matter how good or bad he is, his monstrous appearance would never allow him to grow accustomed to society. He is created to be rejected. It is fact, very bitter fact - the outcome of human-being's irresponsibility and egoism to fulfill its thirst for knowledge. According to Bible, knowledge is considered to be an evil that can destroy the humanity. Just like Eve, doctor Frankenstein reaches for a prohibited knowledge. He goes beyond the limit of a science and morality. He acts against God's rules, which does not lead to anything good, but to a severe punishment.

    Much like "Bram Stoker's Dracula (Coppola produced), here is a stylish, beautifully filmed, & acted update of a classic story. Some people fault Kenneth Branagh for his hyper dramatics, both in the direction, editing, & his acting in this film. I say it was just terrific! Here is a man so obsessed by his mother's death, that he wants nothing less than to bring an end to death! His whirlwind performance is a hypnotizing! A man so possessed by his vision, that it would eventually destroy everyone around him he loves & eventually himself. The most extreme case of irony, of a man who wanted to give life, but in the end brought nothing but death. Robert De Niro. What can I say about his performance as the monster? Not since Boris Karloff's great portrayal, have I seen such pathos, love, & and anger in Frankstein's creation. His interpretation should of at least won him an Oscar nomination. Nothing short of brilliant! "Mary Shelly's Frankenstein" is a film filled with a tornadic vortex of emotions, actions, & circumstance. It is a film that can sweep the viewer in to it's catapulting crescendos & crashes. An emotional roller-coaster ride to one man's oblivion. Profoundly sad, but also, profoundly mesmerizing! Only "the Bride of Frankenstein" matches this film in importance, as a truly transcending film from a classic story, of one man's madness.

    This is a good film but it does NOT follow the Frankenstein story quite well. I think Francis Ford Coppola put a little more effort into his version of Bram Stoker's Dracula than what he put into his adaptation of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. First the deviations from the novel: 1. The creature: In the original novel he had long black hair and did not speak like a Stroke victim. He was actually hyper intelligent and learned exceedingly fast. He was very articulate, perhaps more so than his creator and quoted things like Paradise Lost. In the novel he did not sound like a stroke victim. 2. Elizabeth's heart was not ripped out in the novel. She was strangled. 3. Elizabeth was never brought back in the style of the Frankenstein creature in the novel. For many this is the point where the film jumps the shark. 4. I don't like that this film leaves out the secondary moral of the story. The first moral is always remembered in films that one should not tamper in God's territory, that we should not mess with nature. But what many films forget is the secondary moral, that like a child who had been neglected by a parent the creature had to learn to forgive and that revenge would bring him no peace. I don't know why so many films leave this aspect out. If you want a version of Frankenstein that actually follows Mary Shelley's novel check out the version produced by Hallmark and released to DVD by Lion's Gate starring Luke Goss as the creature. That mini-series version of Frankenstein from 2004 is the most faithful to the book and has (in my opinion) the most sympathetic version of the creature. Now, aside from straying from the novel I will not deny this is a good film, even if some moments are rather hammy and feel as if they were created specifically for the film. This is still an enjoyable movie and does retain the basic ideas behind Mary Shelley's novel. This is a good film with many good actors and special effects that hold up well after nearly twenty years. It's a timeless story and when done correctly the film adaptation is ageless. This was done well. This is one of my top five favorite Frankenstein movies. My favorite Frankenstein films are as follows: 1. The Hallmark version of Frankenstein starring Luke Goss and released through Lion's Gate in 2004. Don't confuse it with any other Frankenstein productions from 2004. Make certain it is the version with Luke Goss as the creature if you choose to watch it. 2. The Bride from 1984. Not to be confused with the more well known "Bride of Frankenstein" this one starred Sting as Baron Frankenstein and Clancy Brown as the creature. This one is a guilty pleasure for me because even though it is cheesy (and very Hammer-esque) it is one of the only versions to have a happy ending for the creature. 3. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. This one is good for it's production values and for drawing attention to the original novel. It's not as faithful as it likes to boast but it is still a good movie. 4. Frankenstein created woman. This is a good one released through Hammer and featuring Peter Cushing as Dr. Frankenstein. This one is cheesy but enjoyable and has all the trappings one expects from a Hammer movie. 5. Frankenstein with Boris Karloff for creating the famous archetype. This 1931 Frankenstein does not follow the book but it is good film and was well made. The image of the creature in this film adaptation with his flat head, bolts in the neck, (apparently) green skin, and elevator shoes is probably the most well known and most associated with the creature even though it's nothing like what Mary Shelley described. 6. Bride of Frankenstein, the sequel to the Karloff version of Frankenestein and directly continues where the 1931 version ended.

    The reanimated corpse of Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein"

    Despite the title, this is not Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein." It's the reanimated corpse of Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein," stitched together with various horror-movie conventions that didn't exist yet in Shelley's time, partly because we've come to know them from other film versions of "Frankenstein." For instance, early in the novel, the 17-year-old Victor Frankenstein begins university and has a couple of quiet office conversations with Professors Krempe and Waldman, neither of whom are medical doctors. He then skips Krempe's lectures and attends only the more inspiring Waldman's. Here, we get the thirty-something (!) Branagh confronting Krempe in a lecture / operating theater, loudly demanding instruction in the ancient theories of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus -- theories that the novel's Victor had already given up on. It's a flashier scene, it's very Hollywood, and it may be "inspired by" Shelley's version, but it nearly reverses the novel's point, scrambling its analysis of how Victor ends up going wrong. The portrayal of the Creature also messes with the story's moral. Yes, he's played for sympathy in a way that's in line with the novel; this may be how Branagh and Coppola convinced themselves that they were doing Shelley's version. But as others here have noted, DeNiro, even with a Bronx accent, is not frightening enough. OK, so he's got some facial scars -- he's not eight feet tall, he doesn't look overpowering, and he seems too obviously decent to suddenly start killing people. Granted, it would be hard even for a great actor to capture the eloquent and well- read yet savage beast that Shelley imagines, but you at least need to make him look frightening enough that we can understand people attacking him and fleeing in terror. The fact that he's "ugly," as he puts it, isn't enough to explain the tragedy. In that regard, a more "traditional" Halloween or horror-movie Frankenstein might actually have served the story better. There are other very big changes, especially late in the story, but I won't give them away. If you leave Shelley out of it -- and in fairness, the producers should have left her out of the title -- and if you overlook a number of things that don't make much sense, then it's a glossy and reasonably entertaining version of "Frankenstein." But it's not Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein," it's another in a long line of loose adaptations.

    Beautiful sets, magnificent lighting and a cornucopia of some of the finest actors on the planet cannot save this film from a real dog of a script and appalling direction. People run here, there, and everywhere. Lighting flashes, Nooooooooooo! is yelled and yelled again. Its a dogs dinner of every trope in the business, with much emphasis on "significant" lines from shallowly developed characters and scenes that linger or hinge on some inconsequential point that may have seemed dramatic somewhere, sometime, but not in the final product. It's nearly two hours long, but feels like three and perhaps should have been cut to one. There is little to celebrate save one great shot worthy of note, Victor Frankenstein carrying the body of Elizabeth up a winding staircase of towering RKO magnificence whilst trailing a long blood red cape.
