    Los Angeles commercial director Wesley Snipes goes to New York to visit dying childhood friend Robert Downey, Jr. (who is in the latter stages of AIDS) and has a quick affair with yuppie Nastassja Kinski. Their secret seems safe until one year later Snipes returns to New York with his erotic, but oft-times mean-spirited wife (Ming Na-Wen) and they meet Kinski by chance when they find out that she is actually married to Downey Jr.'s older brother (a cold and seemingly unfeeling Kyle MacLachlan, even equipped with latex gloves because of his fear of catching AIDS). Would-be potboiler is actually pretty tame in the end with Snipes and Na-Wen providing a few light sparks with a couple of emotional sparring matches, but probably the greatest conflict actually occurs between Snipes and his boss (Thomas Haden Church who in the end is really only a window-dressing character here). Kinski and MacLachlan are more quiet and supposedly deep-thinking than anything else and in the end it is Downey, Jr. who is the revelation being almost unrecognizable as a young man whose body and mind are beginning to decay from his horrid illness. However, it is almost like he is in the wrong film as his part just basically is used as a bridge on more than one occasion between Snipes and Kinski. Writer/director Mike Figgis (who was fresh off "Leaving Las Vegas" in 1995) tends to use coincidence, chance, and splintered relationships between major roles to get his points across. The film stutters and drags to its finale, finally resolving with a would-be jaw-dropping conclusion which in actuality most could probably see a mile away. Just lacks the fire and intensity needed to be much more than a curiosity and little else. 2.5 out of 5 stars.

    I watched it on television in one of these bizarre named channels that often spread some garbage movies. I first was surprised because of the Wesley Snipes appearance in these kind of movie. He normally plays main characters in some mediocre action movies like Blade, making me doubt of his skills as an actor. But in this one he is different: the only action move he made was a single ''kick?'' (a little confusing battle) to some robbers who deserved some more kicks, if we don't count the sex scenes as action scenes of course. It's interesting how he can express feelings like embarrassment, intense love although he keeps his tough-guy style like in the scene where he talks about television with his friends. Natassja Kinski assumed very good the Karen character form by playing a saddened and hurt Karen after being attacked by the robbers. Great acting by the way in the two meetings of the couples in New York, I already smelted that something odd was going to happen. I didn't noticed any plot holes but finally we don't know nearly anything about the characters. The whole film was centered into that ''One Night Stand'', we don't know anything about Max and Mimi's children, about Max past (we know that he likes to smoke joints with his friend Charlie), about Vernon, nothing. It was just a funny succession of consequences that happened after only one night. Some details of the film where very strange though, seeming senseless if I may say. Why the sex scene between Max and Mimi is so long? Was the pot smoking habitude of Max placed there only to fit with the dog smelling Max's pants scene? Why did they made a scene in which Max and his friends talked about television? It's like Kafka does with his novels, writing stories without a reasonable plot just for the art of writing. This movie is made only for the art of movie-making, nothing else. Each scene isn't connected to the other by the common way, it's like each and every one of them are separated by days or maybe years. There's always a dark halo surrounding every moment of the film, especially every time Max meets Karen at the parking, the hotel room, the hospital and at the final party. It's a good film despite what others may say, just watch it.

    If you only know Wesley Snipes from commercials for exercise equipment or Blade the part Vampire movies, then you probably don't remember him back before he was a clich&eacute;. Back when he did things like the Crazy "To Wong Foo". He is great in this movie. Everyone is great. You kinda know it is going to be one of those great little movies when you start seeing the usual suspects of great little indie movies like Kyle McLachlan and Robert Downey Jr plus of course, Julian Sands. Beautifully shot, emotionally wrenching, very human and tolerant about love in all it's aspects (gay/straight, bi-racial, etc) it is just a great great movie. I found it a feel-good movie even though there gut wrenching scenes of loss, mostly thanks to the brilliant Downey. I find it very life affirming.

    Watched "One Night Stand", followed by "Goodfellas" and then watched the Director's Commentary for "One Night Stand." Englightening. Intriguing. Sloppy. "One Night Stand" took on a lot: Racism, Stereotypes, Adultery, AIDS, Family-life. One IMDb author badmouthing this film: "How is this realistic?" In the grand scope of life, we do much more unrealistic things. Problem is, moviegoers need something more refined and a great deal more palatable. We've all eaten Mac & Cheese over the stove and had fancy steak dinners in the same calendar year, yet it's not good on the big screen. The ensemble delivers the story well. The major problem is in Figgis. He takes on way too much at once. He has to edit things down and all these realistic situations (because life is crazy) seem so unrealistic by the moviegoer's eye. He should have reigned it in quite a bit. There was such an attempt to joust with everything, to be REAL. I really cannot even get a handle on writing a short review. If you love Indie pics, you'll love this one. If you love director commentaries, you'll love this one, too. If you want a straight-forward flick, you'll hate "One Night Stand." The editing was rushed and the story was encumbered by all the extra-curriculars: Black Husband/Asian Wife, two-way extra-marital affairs, bi-coastal stereotyping, the Gay/AIDS "agenda." Whoo boy. I just don't have the time to tackle it all adequately, so I'll comment on the actors, which would have made a better script and better editing into a 7 or 8 star film (Goodfellas: 8, The Departed and Rocky: 10. In my book, you have to fire on every cylinder to be a 10. Most films are 4, 5, or 6). Wesley Snipes: Great Dramatic Acting about a man torn between where he is and where he wants to be in life. Ming-Na: excellent "American neglected wife" who happens to be Asian. Very anti-stereotypical role. Her stage presence is underscored by how poorly her role was written. She delivers it strongly. Thomas Hayden Church: He really performed so well, you wished for more of him on Camera, unfortunately, he was written only in support. Nastassia Kinski: Part Muse, Part Heroine in distress, Part Mistress foil to Wen's Mimi. Robert Downey Jr: Drug addict. If you've seen any movie where his character is some sort of addict, you've seen him before. Tab A, meet Slot B. Kyle MacLaughlin: Weakest player. Offered little substance to the movie - which he should have had a major part. Unfortunately, the scrip was way too heavy. Way too complicated, like life often is. A good screenplay strikes the balance, complicating only what is necessary. This script fails that, and in the end, the director has to rush through places where he should stop to breathe, and breathes in places he should have rushed.

    I absolutely love this movie. Figgis' use of music gives me chills and I don't find some of the 'coincidences', in the movie's plot too unbelievable. Rather than being a clich&eacute;d Hollywood film on adultery, I've always thought it to be a joyful celebration of life in the face of mortality. Robert Downey Jnr. milks a whole scene for comedic effect solely with the use of his owl-like eyes. While a similar scene in your average film would be knee-deep in pap miserabilism. There is something subversive in the director and actors finding humour amidst such morbidity. But it's the music that keeps me coming back. Figgis' enthusiasm for jazz is well in evidence here and there's even a neat use of Nina Simone's 'Exactly Like You'. Natassja Kinski and Ming Na Wen don't hurt none either.

    I couldn't tell what was supposed to be the point of "One Night Stand". So there was a bunch of stuff about interracial relationships. Many other movies have done a much better job with that stuff. How could Mike Figgis, after creating a masterpiece like "Leaving Las Vegas" create something so disjointed with this movie? It wastes Wesley Snipes, Nastassja Kinski, Kyle MacLachlan, Ming-Na, Robert Downey Jr and John Ratzenberger on complete nonsense. If this movie has any redeeming qualities, it's that it gave Thomas Haden Church an early starring role, paving the way for him to star in "Sideways". So, in conclusion, Wesley Snipes's character says that anything's better than LA. I, for one, would rather choke on LA's smog than have to watch this movie again.

    Okay, so I've read all of the reviews on this movie. Let me break it down for you. I rented this movie already having a general idea what it was about. Even though I don't care for movies about infidelity, I wanted to see this particular one anyways. Ming-Na Wen is by far my absolute favorite actor, and I have always enjoyed watching Wesley Snipes' action movies. I've read the reviews and have concluded that this movie is getting far too much credit for it's "artsy" side. Yes, I agree with another reviewer that the movie is better once you watch the director's commentary version, but that doesn't replace the fact that I watched the entire movie with my stomach in knots. And don't get it twisted, it IS about infidelity. As the title suggests, there's a one night stand. Okay, I was expecting that. But the events that follow just drag the viewer down. Robert Downey Jr. played a decent role, but nothing extraordinary as others might have you believe. The entire movie is depressing, and the last ten minutes or so of the movie all the way up to the ending is just terrible! I'm not going to spoil anything, but let me just say that I hated it. The two scenes towards the end sealed my negative vote on this movie. I hate to write this, too. As I said, my favorite actor is in the movie, and I really enjoy most of the roles the other main actors have played in other films. But this flick dragged me down, and I wanted to eat a bullet by the end of the movie. Keep in mind, that the director (Michael Figgis) has a thing for infidelity (Does "Internal Affairs" ring any bells?), so just go into it knowing that. I'm sad to say it, but "One Night Stand" was a downer, despite all of the great actors and acting. Honestly, I would not recommend it. If you enjoy being cheated on and watching it happen to other people as well, then you'll probably love this movie. Knock yourself out.

    I find this film pointless. Big deal, there was an interracial relationship. This theme can hardly highlight a movie. And Robert Downey Jr. is totally wasted, having the oxygen mask on him for most of his role. Then again, they should have put oxygen masks on the rest of the cast, to stifle their lines. Come to think about, the audience in the theaters probably needed oxygen masks to keep from fainting at this poor flock. I even found the sex scenes uninteresting. What exactly was the theme or idea, or plot of this movie. No need to issue a spoiler here, because anyone watching this movie should be thoroughly dis-interested in the ending.

    The movie didn't appeal to my wont for pure "feel-good" escapism - but then again neither did Leaving Las Vegas - and the movie follows a similar vein in exposing the uncomfortable nature of unadorned life littered with human flaws and gifts. What gave me a new perspective on the movie was the commentary that very closely correlated with the colour "unblindness" rampant in the society of the commentator. As a Canadian living in rainbow land - Vancouver - seeing mixed racial or ethnic pairings was no remarkable thing - and it didn't hit me what a large role that feature in the movie plays to American audiences. Further judgement was passed on moral issues surrounding homosexual activity and the resulting disease of AIDS. The real moral faux pas or transgression was infidelity - not homosexuality or pairing with someone who complements your phenotype - it is the breaking of trust. If the viewer is more moved by the "shocking" mixed racial and homo gendered sex than the break in trust - then it says something uncomfortable about our shaded view of the world. Divine cast.

    I hated this movie. It is quite possibly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Part of my problem with it is the clever ending. Part of my problem with it is the typical Hollywood sympathetic portrayal of the Saintly AIDS-stricken Homosexual Wise Man. Part of my problem with it is that I just don't like Wesley Snipes much as an actor; to me, the same arrogant personality is present in every movie I've seen him in. Part of it was some extremely cheesy dialog meant to establish his wife's character: Wesley: "But, Honey, the kids...." Ming-na: "F*** the kids, I'm coming!"

    I find this film pointless. Big deal, there was an interracial relationship. This theme can hardly highlight a movie. And Robert Downey Jr. is totally wasted, having the oxygen mask on him for most of his role. Then again, they should have put oxygen masks on the rest of the cast, to stifle their lines. Come to think about, the audience in the theaters probably needed oxygen masks to keep from fainting at this poor flock. I even found the sex scenes uninteresting. What exactly was the theme or idea, or plot of this movie. No need to issue a spoiler here, because anyone watching this movie should be thoroughly dis-interested in the ending.

    The movie didn't appeal to my wont for pure "feel-good" escapism - but then again neither did Leaving Las Vegas - and the movie follows a similar vein in exposing the uncomfortable nature of unadorned life littered with human flaws and gifts. What gave me a new perspective on the movie was the commentary that very closely correlated with the colour "unblindness" rampant in the society of the commentator. As a Canadian living in rainbow land - Vancouver - seeing mixed racial or ethnic pairings was no remarkable thing - and it didn't hit me what a large role that feature in the movie plays to American audiences. Further judgement was passed on moral issues surrounding homosexual activity and the resulting disease of AIDS. The real moral faux pas or transgression was infidelity - not homosexuality or pairing with someone who complements your phenotype - it is the breaking of trust. If the viewer is more moved by the "shocking" mixed racial and homo gendered sex than the break in trust - then it says something uncomfortable about our shaded view of the world. Divine cast.

    I hated this movie. It is quite possibly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Part of my problem with it is the clever ending. Part of my problem with it is the typical Hollywood sympathetic portrayal of the Saintly AIDS-stricken Homosexual Wise Man. Part of my problem with it is that I just don't like Wesley Snipes much as an actor; to me, the same arrogant personality is present in every movie I've seen him in. Part of it was some extremely cheesy dialog meant to establish his wife's character: Wesley: "But, Honey, the kids...." Ming-na: "F*** the kids, I'm coming!"

    Los Angeles commercial director Wesley Snipes goes to New York to visit dying childhood friend Robert Downey, Jr. (who is in the latter stages of AIDS) and has a quick affair with yuppie Nastassja Kinski. Their secret seems safe until one year later Snipes returns to New York with his erotic, but oft-times mean-spirited wife (Ming Na-Wen) and they meet Kinski by chance when they find out that she is actually married to Downey Jr.'s older brother (a cold and seemingly unfeeling Kyle MacLachlan, even equipped with latex gloves because of his fear of catching AIDS). Would-be potboiler is actually pretty tame in the end with Snipes and Na-Wen providing a few light sparks with a couple of emotional sparring matches, but probably the greatest conflict actually occurs between Snipes and his boss (Thomas Haden Church who in the end is really only a window-dressing character here). Kinski and MacLachlan are more quiet and supposedly deep-thinking than anything else and in the end it is Downey, Jr. who is the revelation being almost unrecognizable as a young man whose body and mind are beginning to decay from his horrid illness. However, it is almost like he is in the wrong film as his part just basically is used as a bridge on more than one occasion between Snipes and Kinski. Writer/director Mike Figgis (who was fresh off "Leaving Las Vegas" in 1995) tends to use coincidence, chance, and splintered relationships between major roles to get his points across. The film stutters and drags to its finale, finally resolving with a would-be jaw-dropping conclusion which in actuality most could probably see a mile away. Just lacks the fire and intensity needed to be much more than a curiosity and little else. 2.5 out of 5 stars.

    I watched it on television in one of these bizarre named channels that often spread some garbage movies. I first was surprised because of the Wesley Snipes appearance in these kind of movie. He normally plays main characters in some mediocre action movies like Blade, making me doubt of his skills as an actor. But in this one he is different: the only action move he made was a single ''kick?'' (a little confusing battle) to some robbers who deserved some more kicks, if we don't count the sex scenes as action scenes of course. It's interesting how he can express feelings like embarrassment, intense love although he keeps his tough-guy style like in the scene where he talks about television with his friends. Natassja Kinski assumed very good the Karen character form by playing a saddened and hurt Karen after being attacked by the robbers. Great acting by the way in the two meetings of the couples in New York, I already smelted that something odd was going to happen. I didn't noticed any plot holes but finally we don't know nearly anything about the characters. The whole film was centered into that ''One Night Stand'', we don't know anything about Max and Mimi's children, about Max past (we know that he likes to smoke joints with his friend Charlie), about Vernon, nothing. It was just a funny succession of consequences that happened after only one night. Some details of the film where very strange though, seeming senseless if I may say. Why the sex scene between Max and Mimi is so long? Was the pot smoking habitude of Max placed there only to fit with the dog smelling Max's pants scene? Why did they made a scene in which Max and his friends talked about television? It's like Kafka does with his novels, writing stories without a reasonable plot just for the art of writing. This movie is made only for the art of movie-making, nothing else. Each scene isn't connected to the other by the common way, it's like each and every one of them are separated by days or maybe years. There's always a dark halo surrounding every moment of the film, especially every time Max meets Karen at the parking, the hotel room, the hospital and at the final party. It's a good film despite what others may say, just watch it.

    If you only know Wesley Snipes from commercials for exercise equipment or Blade the part Vampire movies, then you probably don't remember him back before he was a clich&eacute;. Back when he did things like the Crazy "To Wong Foo". He is great in this movie. Everyone is great. You kinda know it is going to be one of those great little movies when you start seeing the usual suspects of great little indie movies like Kyle McLachlan and Robert Downey Jr plus of course, Julian Sands. Beautifully shot, emotionally wrenching, very human and tolerant about love in all it's aspects (gay/straight, bi-racial, etc) it is just a great great movie. I found it a feel-good movie even though there gut wrenching scenes of loss, mostly thanks to the brilliant Downey. I find it very life affirming.

    Watched "One Night Stand", followed by "Goodfellas" and then watched the Director's Commentary for "One Night Stand." Englightening. Intriguing. Sloppy. "One Night Stand" took on a lot: Racism, Stereotypes, Adultery, AIDS, Family-life. One IMDb author badmouthing this film: "How is this realistic?" In the grand scope of life, we do much more unrealistic things. Problem is, moviegoers need something more refined and a great deal more palatable. We've all eaten Mac & Cheese over the stove and had fancy steak dinners in the same calendar year, yet it's not good on the big screen. The ensemble delivers the story well. The major problem is in Figgis. He takes on way too much at once. He has to edit things down and all these realistic situations (because life is crazy) seem so unrealistic by the moviegoer's eye. He should have reigned it in quite a bit. There was such an attempt to joust with everything, to be REAL. I really cannot even get a handle on writing a short review. If you love Indie pics, you'll love this one. If you love director commentaries, you'll love this one, too. If you want a straight-forward flick, you'll hate "One Night Stand." The editing was rushed and the story was encumbered by all the extra-curriculars: Black Husband/Asian Wife, two-way extra-marital affairs, bi-coastal stereotyping, the Gay/AIDS "agenda." Whoo boy. I just don't have the time to tackle it all adequately, so I'll comment on the actors, which would have made a better script and better editing into a 7 or 8 star film (Goodfellas: 8, The Departed and Rocky: 10. In my book, you have to fire on every cylinder to be a 10. Most films are 4, 5, or 6). Wesley Snipes: Great Dramatic Acting about a man torn between where he is and where he wants to be in life. Ming-Na: excellent "American neglected wife" who happens to be Asian. Very anti-stereotypical role. Her stage presence is underscored by how poorly her role was written. She delivers it strongly. Thomas Hayden Church: He really performed so well, you wished for more of him on Camera, unfortunately, he was written only in support. Nastassia Kinski: Part Muse, Part Heroine in distress, Part Mistress foil to Wen's Mimi. Robert Downey Jr: Drug addict. If you've seen any movie where his character is some sort of addict, you've seen him before. Tab A, meet Slot B. Kyle MacLaughlin: Weakest player. Offered little substance to the movie - which he should have had a major part. Unfortunately, the scrip was way too heavy. Way too complicated, like life often is. A good screenplay strikes the balance, complicating only what is necessary. This script fails that, and in the end, the director has to rush through places where he should stop to breathe, and breathes in places he should have rushed.

    I absolutely love this movie. Figgis' use of music gives me chills and I don't find some of the 'coincidences', in the movie's plot too unbelievable. Rather than being a clich&eacute;d Hollywood film on adultery, I've always thought it to be a joyful celebration of life in the face of mortality. Robert Downey Jnr. milks a whole scene for comedic effect solely with the use of his owl-like eyes. While a similar scene in your average film would be knee-deep in pap miserabilism. There is something subversive in the director and actors finding humour amidst such morbidity. But it's the music that keeps me coming back. Figgis' enthusiasm for jazz is well in evidence here and there's even a neat use of Nina Simone's 'Exactly Like You'. Natassja Kinski and Ming Na Wen don't hurt none either.

    I couldn't tell what was supposed to be the point of "One Night Stand". So there was a bunch of stuff about interracial relationships. Many other movies have done a much better job with that stuff. How could Mike Figgis, after creating a masterpiece like "Leaving Las Vegas" create something so disjointed with this movie? It wastes Wesley Snipes, Nastassja Kinski, Kyle MacLachlan, Ming-Na, Robert Downey Jr and John Ratzenberger on complete nonsense. If this movie has any redeeming qualities, it's that it gave Thomas Haden Church an early starring role, paving the way for him to star in "Sideways". So, in conclusion, Wesley Snipes's character says that anything's better than LA. I, for one, would rather choke on LA's smog than have to watch this movie again.

    Okay, so I've read all of the reviews on this movie. Let me break it down for you. I rented this movie already having a general idea what it was about. Even though I don't care for movies about infidelity, I wanted to see this particular one anyways. Ming-Na Wen is by far my absolute favorite actor, and I have always enjoyed watching Wesley Snipes' action movies. I've read the reviews and have concluded that this movie is getting far too much credit for it's "artsy" side. Yes, I agree with another reviewer that the movie is better once you watch the director's commentary version, but that doesn't replace the fact that I watched the entire movie with my stomach in knots. And don't get it twisted, it IS about infidelity. As the title suggests, there's a one night stand. Okay, I was expecting that. But the events that follow just drag the viewer down. Robert Downey Jr. played a decent role, but nothing extraordinary as others might have you believe. The entire movie is depressing, and the last ten minutes or so of the movie all the way up to the ending is just terrible! I'm not going to spoil anything, but let me just say that I hated it. The two scenes towards the end sealed my negative vote on this movie. I hate to write this, too. As I said, my favorite actor is in the movie, and I really enjoy most of the roles the other main actors have played in other films. But this flick dragged me down, and I wanted to eat a bullet by the end of the movie. Keep in mind, that the director (Michael Figgis) has a thing for infidelity (Does "Internal Affairs" ring any bells?), so just go into it knowing that. I'm sad to say it, but "One Night Stand" was a downer, despite all of the great actors and acting. Honestly, I would not recommend it. If you enjoy being cheated on and watching it happen to other people as well, then you'll probably love this movie. Knock yourself out.

The entire movie is depressing, and the last ten minutes or so of the movie all the way up to the ending is just terrible! I'm not going to spoil anything, but let me just say that I hated it. The two scenes towards the end sealed my negative vote on this movie. I hate to write this, too. As I said, my favorite actor is in the movie, and I really enjoy most of the roles the other main actors have played in other films. But this flick dragged me down, and I wanted to eat a bullet by the end of the movie. Keep in mind, that the director (Michael Figgis) has a thing for infidelity (Does "Internal Affairs" ring any bells?), so just go into it knowing that. I'm sad to say it, but "One Night Stand" was a downer, despite all of the great actors and acting. Honestly, I would not recommend it. If you enjoy being cheated on and watching it happen to other people as well, then you'll probably love this movie. Knock yourself out.

    I find this film pointless. Big deal, there was an interracial relationship. This theme can hardly highlight a movie. And Robert Downey Jr. is totally wasted, having the oxygen mask on him for most of his role. Then again, they should have put oxygen masks on the rest of the cast, to stifle their lines. Come to think about, the audience in the theaters probably needed oxygen masks to keep from fainting at this poor flock. I even found the sex scenes uninteresting. What exactly was the theme or idea, or plot of this movie. No need to issue a spoiler here, because anyone watching this movie should be thoroughly dis-interested in the ending.

    The movie didn't appeal to my wont for pure "feel-good" escapism - but then again neither did Leaving Las Vegas - and the movie follows a similar vein in exposing the uncomfortable nature of unadorned life littered with human flaws and gifts. What gave me a new perspective on the movie was the commentary that very closely correlated with the colour "unblindness" rampant in the society of the commentator. As a Canadian living in rainbow land - Vancouver - seeing mixed racial or ethnic pairings was no remarkable thing - and it didn't hit me what a large role that feature in the movie plays to American audiences. Further judgement was passed on moral issues surrounding homosexual activity and the resulting disease of AIDS. The real moral faux pas or transgression was infidelity - not homosexuality or pairing with someone who complements your phenotype - it is the breaking of trust. If the viewer is more moved by the "shocking" mixed racial and homo gendered sex than the break in trust - then it says something uncomfortable about our shaded view of the world. Divine cast.

    I hated this movie. It is quite possibly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Part of my problem with it is the clever ending. Part of my problem with it is the typical Hollywood sympathetic portrayal of the Saintly AIDS-stricken Homosexual Wise Man. Part of my problem with it is that I just don't like Wesley Snipes much as an actor; to me, the same arrogant personality is present in every movie I've seen him in. Part of it was some extremely cheesy dialog meant to establish his wife's character: Wesley: "But, Honey, the kids...." Ming-na: "F*** the kids, I'm coming!"

    Los Angeles commercial director Wesley Snipes goes to New York to visit dying childhood friend Robert Downey, Jr. (who is in the latter stages of AIDS) and has a quick affair with yuppie Nastassja Kinski. Their secret seems safe until one year later Snipes returns to New York with his erotic, but oft-times mean-spirited wife (Ming Na-Wen) and they meet Kinski by chance when they find out that she is actually married to Downey Jr.'s older brother (a cold and seemingly unfeeling Kyle MacLachlan, even equipped with latex gloves because of his fear of catching AIDS). Would-be potboiler is actually pretty tame in the end with Snipes and Na-Wen providing a few light sparks with a couple of emotional sparring matches, but probably the greatest conflict actually occurs between Snipes and his boss (Thomas Haden Church who in the end is really only a window-dressing character here). Kinski and MacLachlan are more quiet and supposedly deep-thinking than anything else and in the end it is Downey, Jr. who is the revelation being almost unrecognizable as a young man whose body and mind are beginning to decay from his horrid illness. However, it is almost like he is in the wrong film as his part just basically is used as a bridge on more than one occasion between Snipes and Kinski. Writer/director Mike Figgis (who was fresh off "Leaving Las Vegas" in 1995) tends to use coincidence, chance, and splintered relationships between major roles to get his points across. The film stutters and drags to its finale, finally resolving with a would-be jaw-dropping conclusion which in actuality most could probably see a mile away. Just lacks the fire and intensity needed to be much more than a curiosity and little else. 2.5 out of 5 stars.

    I watched it on television in one of these bizarre named channels that often spread some garbage movies. I first was surprised because of the Wesley Snipes appearance in these kind of movie. He normally plays main characters in some mediocre action movies like Blade, making me doubt of his skills as an actor. But in this one he is different: the only action move he made was a single ''kick?'' (a little confusing battle) to some robbers who deserved some more kicks, if we don't count the sex scenes as action scenes of course. It's interesting how he can express feelings like embarrassment, intense love although he keeps his tough-guy style like in the scene where he talks about television with his friends. Natassja Kinski assumed very good the Karen character form by playing a saddened and hurt Karen after being attacked by the robbers. Great acting by the way in the two meetings of the couples in New York, I already smelted that something odd was going to happen. I didn't noticed any plot holes but finally we don't know nearly anything about the characters. The whole film was centered into that ''One Night Stand'', we don't know anything about Max and Mimi's children, about Max past (we know that he likes to smoke joints with his friend Charlie), about Vernon, nothing. It was just a funny succession of consequences that happened after only one night. Some details of the film where very strange though, seeming senseless if I may say. Why the sex scene between Max and Mimi is so long? Was the pot smoking habitude of Max placed there only to fit with the dog smelling Max's pants scene? Why did they made a scene in which Max and his friends talked about television? It's like Kafka does with his novels, writing stories without a reasonable plot just for the art of writing. This movie is made only for the art of movie-making, nothing else. Each scene isn't connected to the other by the common way, it's like each and every one of them are separated by days or maybe years. There's always a dark halo surrounding every moment of the film, especially every time Max meets Karen at the parking, the hotel room, the hospital and at the final party. It's a good film despite what others may say, just watch it.

    If you only know Wesley Snipes from commercials for exercise equipment or Blade the part Vampire movies, then you probably don't remember him back before he was a clich&eacute;. Back when he did things like the Crazy "To Wong Foo". He is great in this movie. Everyone is great. You kinda know it is going to be one of those great little movies when you start seeing the usual suspects of great little indie movies like Kyle McLachlan and Robert Downey Jr plus of course, Julian Sands. Beautifully shot, emotionally wrenching, very human and tolerant about love in all it's aspects (gay/straight, bi-racial, etc) it is just a great great movie. I found it a feel-good movie even though there gut wrenching scenes of loss, mostly thanks to the brilliant Downey. I find it very life affirming.

    Watched "One Night Stand", followed by "Goodfellas" and then watched the Director's Commentary for "One Night Stand." Englightening. Intriguing. Sloppy. "One Night Stand" took on a lot: Racism, Stereotypes, Adultery, AIDS, Family-life. One IMDb author badmouthing this film: "How is this realistic?" In the grand scope of life, we do much more unrealistic things. Problem is, moviegoers need something more refined and a great deal more palatable. We've all eaten Mac & Cheese over the stove and had fancy steak dinners in the same calendar year, yet it's not good on the big screen. The ensemble delivers the story well. The major problem is in Figgis. He takes on way too much at once. He has to edit things down and all these realistic situations (because life is crazy) seem so unrealistic by the moviegoer's eye. He should have reigned it in quite a bit. There was such an attempt to joust with everything, to be REAL. I really cannot even get a handle on writing a short review. If you love Indie pics, you'll love this one. If you love director commentaries, you'll love this one, too. If you want a straight-forward flick, you'll hate "One Night Stand." The editing was rushed and the story was encumbered by all the extra-curriculars: Black Husband/Asian Wife, two-way extra-marital affairs, bi-coastal stereotyping, the Gay/AIDS "agenda." Whoo boy. I just don't have the time to tackle it all adequately, so I'll comment on the actors, which would have made a better script and better editing into a 7 or 8 star film (Goodfellas: 8, The Departed and Rocky: 10. In my book, you have to fire on every cylinder to be a 10. Most films are 4, 5, or 6). Wesley Snipes: Great Dramatic Acting about a man torn between where he is and where he wants to be in life. Ming-Na: excellent "American neglected wife" who happens to be Asian. Very anti-stereotypical role. Her stage presence is underscored by how poorly her role was written. She delivers it strongly. Thomas Hayden Church: He really performed so well, you wished for more of him on Camera, unfortunately, he was written only in support. Nastassia Kinski: Part Muse, Part Heroine in distress, Part Mistress foil to Wen's Mimi. Robert Downey Jr: Drug addict. If you've seen any movie where his character is some sort of addict, you've seen him before. Tab A, meet Slot B. Kyle MacLaughlin: Weakest player. Offered little substance to the movie - which he should have had a major part. Unfortunately, the scrip was way too heavy. Way too complicated, like life often is. A good screenplay strikes the balance, complicating only what is necessary. This script fails that, and in the end, the director has to rush through places where he should stop to breathe, and breathes in places he should have rushed.

    I absolutely love this movie. Figgis' use of music gives me chills and I don't find some of the 'coincidences', in the movie's plot too unbelievable. Rather than being a clich&eacute;d Hollywood film on adultery, I've always thought it to be a joyful celebration of life in the face of mortality. Robert Downey Jnr. milks a whole scene for comedic effect solely with the use of his owl-like eyes. While a similar scene in your average film would be knee-deep in pap miserabilism. There is something subversive in the director and actors finding humour amidst such morbidity. But it's the music that keeps me coming back. Figgis' enthusiasm for jazz is well in evidence here and there's even a neat use of Nina Simone's 'Exactly Like You'. Natassja Kinski and Ming Na Wen don't hurt none either.

    I couldn't tell what was supposed to be the point of "One Night Stand". So there was a bunch of stuff about interracial relationships. Many other movies have done a much better job with that stuff. How could Mike Figgis, after creating a masterpiece like "Leaving Las Vegas" create something so disjointed with this movie? It wastes Wesley Snipes, Nastassja Kinski, Kyle MacLachlan, Ming-Na, Robert Downey Jr and John Ratzenberger on complete nonsense. If this movie has any redeeming qualities, it's that it gave Thomas Haden Church an early starring role, paving the way for him to star in "Sideways". So, in conclusion, Wesley Snipes's character says that anything's better than LA. I, for one, would rather choke on LA's smog than have to watch this movie again.

    Okay, so I've read all of the reviews on this movie. Let me break it down for you. I rented this movie already having a general idea what it was about. Even though I don't care for movies about infidelity, I wanted to see this particular one anyways. Ming-Na Wen is by far my absolute favorite actor, and I have always enjoyed watching Wesley Snipes' action movies. I've read the reviews and have concluded that this movie is getting far too much credit for it's "artsy" side. Yes, I agree with another reviewer that the movie is better once you watch the director's commentary version, but that doesn't replace the fact that I watched the entire movie with my stomach in knots. And don't get it twisted, it IS about infidelity. As the title suggests, there's a one night stand. Okay, I was expecting that. But the events that follow just drag the viewer down. Robert Downey Jr. played a decent role, but nothing extraordinary as others might have you believe. The entire movie is depressing, and the last ten minutes or so of the movie all the way up to the ending is just terrible! I'm not going to spoil anything, but let me just say that I hated it. The two scenes towards the end sealed my negative vote on this movie. I hate to write this, too.
