 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Textile company heir Wayland is accused of murder of a prostitute named Elizabeth, whose body was found cut in two in the park. The murder is investigated by tough detective Kennesaw and his less experienced partner Braxton. Wayland is a heavy drinker and compulsive liar, he is prone to memory losses and periods of heavy violence. He is rich enough to access necessary information, and he gets the interrogators' own dark secrets - Kennesaw is angry about affairs his wife had and had let off steam with Elizabeth, and Braxton has gambling debts with Mook, who is demanding payment.

    This movie is a hidden treasure . A clever and dark psychological thriller . It reminds me of a movie that David Fincher ("Se7en") would have made if he was in shape . "The Liar" or "The Deceiver" as the movie is sometimes known is an intriguing movie that keeps you at the edge of your seat. This is an example of movie in which you can have three people talking in one room and you can't take your eyes off screen. The movie is really dark and full of tension. You can never know what will happens next and what dark secret will be revealed. You must figure out for yourself what is true and what is lie. Tim Ruth is great as the main hero (?) who toys with other people minds. He is really one strange guy. Chris Penn gives a really good support in a rather standard role of not too bright cop. The real star here is Michael Rooker who is AMAZING . His performance deserves an Oscar. You have to see it for yourself. Renee Zellweger and Ellen Burstyn also give quite memorable performances. Great movie . A pearl . I give it 8/10.

    Deceiver (AKA: Liar) is directed and written by Jonas and Josh Pate. It stars Tim Roth, Chris Penn, Michael Rooker, Ellen Burstyn, Ren&eacute;e Zellweger and Rosanna Arquette. Music is by Harry Gregson-Williams and cinematography by Bill Butler. The gruesome murder of a prostitute finds chief suspect James Wayland (Roth) in an interrogation room undergoing a lie detector test. Two detectives, Phillip Braxton (Penn) and Edward Kennesaw (Rooker), are overseeing the test and sure of Wayland's guilt. But they are soon to find that Wayland is no push over and as the mind games start, dark secrets begin to come into play... Without doubt it's an acquired taste, met with indifference upon its release and still causing debates on internet forums, Deceiver is one of those films that infuriates and fascinates in equal measure. As the title of the film suggests, deception and untruths are the order of the day here, not just in the claustrophobic interrogation room, but also in how the brothers Pate toy with us the audience. With its reliance on a non linear structure and convoluted plot, focusing the attention is greatly required, especially since the use of a rug-pull device will either seal or kill the deal. As the walls close in on the interrogation room sequences and the flashbacks and character subplots flit in and out of the tale, the Pate brothers bring striking photography and angles into play. Sometimes it's a POV camera technique that has an edginess that seems to be probing for a crack in the armour of the person it looks at, at other instances it's distorted backdrops that run concurrently with the psychological chaos buzzing around the sweat tinged room. While the dialogue the characters are given crackles with the hard-boiled intensity that graced many a 40s and 50s noir thriller. With a trio of superb lead male performances leading the way and a narrative loaded with duplicity and deviousness, Deceiver is crackerjack neo-noir. It's guilty of excess at times, and it's not hard to understand why some find the trickery too much to bare, but for those who like labyrinthine crime thrillers then this hits the spot. In fact! Repeat viewing is very much recommended. 8/10

    Deceiver is another of these must see movies. It's one of my top ten favorites. The movie works partially because of the solid performances from it's leads, Roth, an actor who never disappoints, the best of the three. Very much like that AFI winner, The Interview, Deceiver is much more fun in the way Roth screws with you. He's the prime suspect in the murder of a high class call girl, Elizabeth Loftas (Renee Zewellger) who oozes a lot of damn sexiness, as well being a pitiable character, who you really feel sorry for, not just in her demise. There are moments in the film, and it's mainly towards the end, that you don't believe Roth is actually the killer. In his interview, where he's hounded by two cops, (Michael Rooker and Chris Penn) over a couple of days, Roth is obviously playing his own game, prolonging the interview, failing a polygraph, by faking a cough, whatever. We don't know what trick he has up his sleeve next. One scene, this game, involving cards and lies, one that Roth was obviously spose' to get caught out on, he outsmarts them, by playing funny buggers. I loved it. He's also an epileptic, we discover, this disability working to his advantage. We learn some interesting facts on epilepsy, and it's effects if mixed with this lethal drink, Roth's drunk, where a famous artist is referred as told by Michael Parks, always great, as a psychiatrist. In one violent scene, Roth explodes under pressure and begins throttling Rooker. These two cops have their own demons, Penn a gambler, Rooker, an old acquaintance of the dead hooker. Roth knows all the background of these cops, as we can see how this fits into the story, also as in Roth's plan of deception. Roth has ties with Penn's gambling friends where money can buy information. As Roth tells them "I'm filthy rich, loaded". We even have one imaginary scene in a rich dining room with Roth and his parents. They're seated, at one end of this long, table, Roth sitting at other. Obviously from this, we get the gist he's not on social grounds with his parents, or, he's just an isolated child. It's a funny scene due to some of Roth's dialogue, where he gets up, goes to his mother and stabs her, then sits back down and continues buttering his bread, some blood merging with the butter on the knife. Roth makes this movie, enjoyably entertaining, that you wouldn't want another actor to fill this character's shoes. He's so funny in many scenes, being smug and grinning loud. The relationship between Rooker and his wife (Rosanna Arquette) who's just scenery in this movie was just puzzling, like an enigma. Like Roth, Rooker flashes out too, one weird scene in Rooker's kitchen. What the hell what that about. Things become quite heated as the film comes to wraps, with Rooker even being putting on the stand. When Rooker, is questioned as to killing Loftas, he can't answer. This movie never loses it's fire, right, up to the end, and it's killer twist. I never found any bit of the movie boring. It's solid background story is great in one hell of an underrated movie. Ellen Burstyn, as evil auntie Mook, who runs the gambling operation, where Penn's indebted to them, rules. Whatever happened to that really nice mother/actress she played the Exorcist.

    This has hints of Abel Ferrara about it (esp. the welcome appearance of the late and lamented Chris Penn from Ferrara's 'The Funeral.') I've seen this twice now, and am still not quite sure who really murdered Elizabeth. It doesn't really matter, I suppose, but there's a sense here in which style predominates a bit too strongly over substance. Michael Rooker & Tim Roth overact a bit - so the steadying presence of Chris Penn is helpful here. I'd liked to have known more about Roth's upbringing and so forth than we're granted. The scenes of him with his parents & friends are some of the best - all that baloney with lie detectors in dimly lit rooms becomes a bit dreary after a while. Nice to see 1) Michael Parks (one of the nastiest villains in Twin Peaks) - here confirming one's idea that psychiatrists and psychologists are easily more strange and conflicted than their patients, and 2) Mark Damon - most famous in American cinema from Roger Corman's Fall of the House of Usher way back in 1960! Worth an outing if you should ever get bored with the Pittsburgh Penguins, but hardly worth all the effort you need to expend in an attempt to 'work out the story.' (By the way, are all American police really like this?)

    First of all, this is not really a mystery thriller, it's more of an opportunity for the actors to chew the scenery. The plot makes no sense and the ending even less. It is pretentious in the extreme. Evidently the writers thought they were exploring the depths of the human soul and how people deceive themselves and others. Actually it's a mess. The three main characters, the suspect (Tim Roth) and the two cops are rotten to the core; in fact every character in this movie is rotten except for the prostitute/victim (Zellweger) who's an amiable dunce. A young woman has been murdered. The suspect is hooked to a lie detector and begins a game of psychological cat and mouse, the premise of which is so bogus it's impossible to sustain interest. All three, suspect and two cops, are lying and covering up unsavory parts of their lives. I got the feeling that the script was designed by postmodernists who don't believe there is any reality or any truth. This makes for terrible storytelling because if there's no reality as a reference point, there is absolutely no interest in the outcome. This is "Last Year at Marianbad" disguised as thriller. The ending doesn't make any sense because we are never told who actually committed the murder. We're given a brief scene, about five seconds, at the very end which suggests that the suspect has in fact faked his death and is revived, but that is too little to be sure of anything. How could that happen? Or was that just another flashback? Since everything seems to take place in an alternate surrealistic universe, where nothing makes sense anyway, then the only thought we are left with is: "Who cares?"

    ..with celebrities such as Tim Roth, Renee Z, and Chris Penn...I have the answer. This movie was beyond horrible. The blatant anachronisms are never explained, the "twist" was anything but...and well, shoot (imdb wouldn't allow me to say spell out a different word..even when i tried to use alternative spelling-huh, what a family friendly site!), folks..save your dollar and/or time and don't bother. I'm also adding text here because my initial review was very brief--I attempted to just tell you'll that this movie stinks...but apparently I have to go on. and on. and on. so once again, don't see this movie. it stinks. it stinks. P.S. don't believe reviewers that tell you must be intelligent to "get" this movie. if you don't get it, it's because the movie failed miserably. period. period.

    CAUTION ****SPOILERS************ STARTS WITH A SPOILER! ** The staged death near the end was a bit implausible and Braxton's part was not completely explained. Seems the money he puts in the Lieutenant Kennesaw's drawer is planted to give the Lieutenant grief, but was Braxton in on it? Is the appearance of Kennesaw taking payments or bribes sufficient justice for a murderer? Especially when they had a videotape showing that Kennesaw knew the hooker and was sexually violent with her -- possibly enough to establish a solid case for homicide? So why not just have him arrested and forego the need for Wayland to go underground and lose his inheritance? Like IMDBer "Robertllr" asked, why was the staged Braxton "debt" to Mookie integral to the plot? Sure, it was a flexing by Wayland, but unnecessary. And why other than to feed one's own ego was this insidious game even played against the police, especially tormenting Kennesaw? Yes there were lots of implausibilities and possibly unexplained parts of the plots. Elisabeth was adorable and rose above the part and lines, upstaging Rosanna Arquette (Mrs. Kennesaw) who had a similar part but looked terrible in character. Shapely Elisabeth is pretty and portrayed the tenderness in her platonic bond with Wayland nicely. The shrink and Mookie are famous actors and their fairly minor parts were very well-played. Ellen Burstyn as Mookie, with that hair, looked like Cate Blanchett when she played Bob Dylan in "I'm Not There." The film showed some anti-law enforcement leanings: a guy gets routinely manhandled by two cops in the background yet visible area at the station, just outside the interrogation room. The police in my city are much smarter and better-educated than this. The polygraph team is composed of a security guard that barely finished high school, and a knotted up, jealous, insecure tough, who are openly advertising they have, can and will manipulate the testing to try to convict Wayland, and brag about how poor lie detector results have locked men up for years. The most blatant incredibility is the cops' simplistic read on Wayland's answers: OK you have admitted to lies that aren't white lies so you must be a habitual, malicious liar. When he showed them he could trick the lie detector machine by picking a playing card, and causing it to malfunction when he lied and told the truth, they naturally would have suspended the test. And the cops' remarks that you can't outsmart the machine" was ludicrous and inconsistent, as polygraph tests are not determinant. I liked everything about else this film. It wasn't as involved as Usual Suspects, and the similarities were few. I disagree with Ebert about this being about cleverness for cleverness' sake, and the plot trumping the actors. But I can't hold a candle to Ebert. Roth received a British Oscar and has been nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe. Ebert says the plot upstaged the actors and that this as a film about actors rather than characters. It's interesting that he's the star of TV's "Lie to Me," in which he's Dr. Cal Lightman, an Expert in Lies and Liars. I liked the ending. What tipped it to me was the mortician with the shiner, though the overly-long camera shot on the face of the vaguely familiar ambulance-driver only sort of evoked a little suspicion. Got it this as my free Blockbuster "oldies" flicks. What a treasure!

    This film has a very simple story, a murder is committed with only one suspect and the police are using a lie detector to try and prove he did it. The film is interesting mainly due to the performance of Roth as the suspect who is determined to prove his innocence, whether true or not, by whatever means necessary. This is a dark and smart film with both Roth and Rooker giving excellent performances. The pace is quick with tense interrogations being broken up by flashbacks and background showing a little of the problems faced by each character. The ending is a little off, it is too convenient and not as good as the rest of the writing. A good if flawed film.

    One thing you'll immediately notice about this crime thriller is its extremely dark look, this movie really makes you appreciate sunlight. All the action happens in this one really unpleasant interrogation room, only some occasional flashbacks make you remember there's a world outside, a world full of pain that is. The claustrophobic atmosphere is the strongest point to this movie, because it makes the psychological insights to our three main characters all the more interesting. Who did it isn't the main issue here, the main issue is how and when the killer will finally be caught. Eventually the eternal darkness gets tiresome, but by then the plot is actually moving someplace so it doesn't really matter. What does matter is the ending though, which I've seen quite a lot of times before, often better written. That is to me the only disappointment to this movie, the predictability of the ending. Other than that it's a nice piece of atmosphere.

    An extremely dirty movie. Everything is dirty: a horrid crime where the victim is a prostitute and the main suspect is a rich young epileptic with no moral boundaries who drinks drugs down with absinthe. The investigation is led by a gambler and a man haunted by his own dark ghosts, threatening to destroy his marriage. The operator's work is also dirty, the picture is dark, people's faces reveal more and more animalistic features of their owners, turning the all in monsters by the end of the film. The investigation spiraling out of control reveals increasingly dirty details of the case. The end is shocking in it's cruelty. This movie may be crossing a moral verge of our perception of "dirt", making us watch it till the end never taking our eyes off the screen. It reaches it's goad - we become engrossed in the "dirt", seduced by it's dark appeal. An exquisitely dirty movie.

We're given a brief scene, about five seconds, at the very end which suggests that the suspect has in fact faked his death and is revived, but that is too little to be sure of anything. How could that happen? Or was that just another flashback? Since everything seems to take place in an alternate surrealistic universe, where nothing makes sense anyway, then the only thought we are left with is: "Who cares?"

    ..with celebrities such as Tim Roth, Renee Z, and Chris Penn...I have the answer. This movie was beyond horrible. The blatant anachronisms are never explained, the "twist" was anything but...and well, shoot (imdb wouldn't allow me to say spell out a different word..even when i tried to use alternative spelling-huh, what a family friendly site!), folks..save your dollar and/or time and don't bother. I'm also adding text here because my initial review was very brief--I attempted to just tell you'll that this movie stinks...but apparently I have to go on. and on. and on. so once again, don't see this movie. it stinks. it stinks. P.S. don't believe reviewers that tell you must be intelligent to "get" this movie. if you don't get it, it's because the movie failed miserably. period. period.

    CAUTION ****SPOILERS************ STARTS WITH A SPOILER! ** The staged death near the end was a bit implausible and Braxton's part was not completely explained. Seems the money he puts in the Lieutenant Kennesaw's drawer is planted to give the Lieutenant grief, but was Braxton in on it? Is the appearance of Kennesaw taking payments or bribes sufficient justice for a murderer? Especially when they had a videotape showing that Kennesaw knew the hooker and was sexually violent with her -- possibly enough to establish a solid case for homicide? So why not just have him arrested and forego the need for Wayland to go underground and lose his inheritance? Like IMDBer "Robertllr" asked, why was the staged Braxton "debt" to Mookie integral to the plot? Sure, it was a flexing by Wayland, but unnecessary. And why other than to feed one's own ego was this insidious game even played against the police, especially tormenting Kennesaw? Yes there were lots of implausibilities and possibly unexplained parts of the plots. Elisabeth was adorable and rose above the part and lines, upstaging Rosanna Arquette (Mrs. Kennesaw) who had a similar part but looked terrible in character. Shapely Elisabeth is pretty and portrayed the tenderness in her platonic bond with Wayland nicely. The shrink and Mookie are famous actors and their fairly minor parts were very well-played. Ellen Burstyn as Mookie, with that hair, looked like Cate Blanchett when she played Bob Dylan in "I'm Not There." The film showed some anti-law enforcement leanings: a guy gets routinely manhandled by two cops in the background yet visible area at the station, just outside the interrogation room. The police in my city are much smarter and better-educated than this. The polygraph team is composed of a security guard that barely finished high school, and a knotted up, jealous, insecure tough, who are openly advertising they have, can and will manipulate the testing to try to convict Wayland, and brag about how poor lie detector results have locked men up for years. The most blatant incredibility is the cops' simplistic read on Wayland's answers: OK you have admitted to lies that aren't white lies so you must be a habitual, malicious liar. When he showed them he could trick the lie detector machine by picking a playing card, and causing it to malfunction when he lied and told the truth, they naturally would have suspended the test. And the cops' remarks that you can't outsmart the machine" was ludicrous and inconsistent, as polygraph tests are not determinant. I liked everything about else this film. It wasn't as involved as Usual Suspects, and the similarities were few. I disagree with Ebert about this being about cleverness for cleverness' sake, and the plot trumping the actors. But I can't hold a candle to Ebert. Roth received a British Oscar and has been nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe. Ebert says the plot upstaged the actors and that this as a film about actors rather than characters. It's interesting that he's the star of TV's "Lie to Me," in which he's Dr. Cal Lightman, an Expert in Lies and Liars. I liked the ending. What tipped it to me was the mortician with the shiner, though the overly-long camera shot on the face of the vaguely familiar ambulance-driver only sort of evoked a little suspicion. Got it this as my free Blockbuster "oldies" flicks. What a treasure!

    This film has a very simple story, a murder is committed with only one suspect and the police are using a lie detector to try and prove he did it. The film is interesting mainly due to the performance of Roth as the suspect who is determined to prove his innocence, whether true or not, by whatever means necessary. This is a dark and smart film with both Roth and Rooker giving excellent performances. The pace is quick with tense interrogations being broken up by flashbacks and background showing a little of the problems faced by each character. The ending is a little off, it is too convenient and not as good as the rest of the writing. A good if flawed film.

    One thing you'll immediately notice about this crime thriller is its extremely dark look, this movie really makes you appreciate sunlight. All the action happens in this one really unpleasant interrogation room, only some occasional flashbacks make you remember there's a world outside, a world full of pain that is. The claustrophobic atmosphere is the strongest point to this movie, because it makes the psychological insights to our three main characters all the more interesting. Who did it isn't the main issue here, the main issue is how and when the killer will finally be caught. Eventually the eternal darkness gets tiresome, but by then the plot is actually moving someplace so it doesn't really matter. What does matter is the ending though, which I've seen quite a lot of times before, often better written. That is to me the only disappointment to this movie, the predictability of the ending. Other than that it's a nice piece of atmosphere.

    An extremely dirty movie. Everything is dirty: a horrid crime where the victim is a prostitute and the main suspect is a rich young epileptic with no moral boundaries who drinks drugs down with absinthe. The investigation is led by a gambler and a man haunted by his own dark ghosts, threatening to destroy his marriage. The operator's work is also dirty, the picture is dark, people's faces reveal more and more animalistic features of their owners, turning the all in monsters by the end of the film. The investigation spiraling out of control reveals increasingly dirty details of the case. The end is shocking in it's cruelty. This movie may be crossing a moral verge of our perception of "dirt", making us watch it till the end never taking our eyes off the screen. It reaches it's goad - we become engrossed in the "dirt", seduced by it's dark appeal. An exquisitely dirty movie.

    This movie is a hidden treasure . A clever and dark psychological thriller . It reminds me of a movie that David Fincher ("Se7en") would have made if he was in shape . "The Liar" or "The Deceiver" as the movie is sometimes known is an intriguing movie that keeps you at the edge of your seat. This is an example of movie in which you can have three people talking in one room and you can't take your eyes off screen. The movie is really dark and full of tension. You can never know what will happens next and what dark secret will be revealed. You must figure out for yourself what is true and what is lie. Tim Ruth is great as the main hero (?) who toys with other people minds. He is really one strange guy. Chris Penn gives a really good support in a rather standard role of not too bright cop. The real star here is Michael Rooker who is AMAZING . His performance deserves an Oscar. You have to see it for yourself. Renee Zellweger and Ellen Burstyn also give quite memorable performances. Great movie . A pearl . I give it 8/10.

    Deceiver (AKA: Liar) is directed and written by Jonas and Josh Pate. It stars Tim Roth, Chris Penn, Michael Rooker, Ellen Burstyn, Ren&eacute;e Zellweger and Rosanna Arquette. Music is by Harry Gregson-Williams and cinematography by Bill Butler. The gruesome murder of a prostitute finds chief suspect James Wayland (Roth) in an interrogation room undergoing a lie detector test. Two detectives, Phillip Braxton (Penn) and Edward Kennesaw (Rooker), are overseeing the test and sure of Wayland's guilt. But they are soon to find that Wayland is no push over and as the mind games start, dark secrets begin to come into play... Without doubt it's an acquired taste, met with indifference upon its release and still causing debates on internet forums, Deceiver is one of those films that infuriates and fascinates in equal measure. As the title of the film suggests, deception and untruths are the order of the day here, not just in the claustrophobic interrogation room, but also in how the brothers Pate toy with us the audience. With its reliance on a non linear structure and convoluted plot, focusing the attention is greatly required, especially since the use of a rug-pull device will either seal or kill the deal. As the walls close in on the interrogation room sequences and the flashbacks and character subplots flit in and out of the tale, the Pate brothers bring striking photography and angles into play. Sometimes it's a POV camera technique that has an edginess that seems to be probing for a crack in the armour of the person it looks at, at other instances it's distorted backdrops that run concurrently with the psychological chaos buzzing around the sweat tinged room. While the dialogue the characters are given crackles with the hard-boiled intensity that graced many a 40s and 50s noir thriller. With a trio of superb lead male performances leading the way and a narrative loaded with duplicity and deviousness, Deceiver is crackerjack neo-noir. It's guilty of excess at times, and it's not hard to understand why some find the trickery too much to bare, but for those who like labyrinthine crime thrillers then this hits the spot. In fact! Repeat viewing is very much recommended. 8/10

    Deceiver is another of these must see movies. It's one of my top ten favorites. The movie works partially because of the solid performances from it's leads, Roth, an actor who never disappoints, the best of the three. Very much like that AFI winner, The Interview, Deceiver is much more fun in the way Roth screws with you. He's the prime suspect in the murder of a high class call girl, Elizabeth Loftas (Renee Zewellger) who oozes a lot of damn sexiness, as well being a pitiable character, who you really feel sorry for, not just in her demise. There are moments in the film, and it's mainly towards the end, that you don't believe Roth is actually the killer. In his interview, where he's hounded by two cops, (Michael Rooker and Chris Penn) over a couple of days, Roth is obviously playing his own game, prolonging the interview, failing a polygraph, by faking a cough, whatever. We don't know what trick he has up his sleeve next. One scene, this game, involving cards and lies, one that Roth was obviously spose' to get caught out on, he outsmarts them, by playing funny buggers. I loved it. He's also an epileptic, we discover, this disability working to his advantage. We learn some interesting facts on epilepsy, and it's effects if mixed with this lethal drink, Roth's drunk, where a famous artist is referred as told by Michael Parks, always great, as a psychiatrist. In one violent scene, Roth explodes under pressure and begins throttling Rooker. These two cops have their own demons, Penn a gambler, Rooker, an old acquaintance of the dead hooker. Roth knows all the background of these cops, as we can see how this fits into the story, also as in Roth's plan of deception. Roth has ties with Penn's gambling friends where money can buy information. As Roth tells them "I'm filthy rich, loaded". We even have one imaginary scene in a rich dining room with Roth and his parents. They're seated, at one end of this long, table, Roth sitting at other. Obviously from this, we get the gist he's not on social grounds with his parents, or, he's just an isolated child. It's a funny scene due to some of Roth's dialogue, where he gets up, goes to his mother and stabs her, then sits back down and continues buttering his bread, some blood merging with the butter on the knife. Roth makes this movie, enjoyably entertaining, that you wouldn't want another actor to fill this character's shoes. He's so funny in many scenes, being smug and grinning loud. The relationship between Rooker and his wife (Rosanna Arquette) who's just scenery in this movie was just puzzling, like an enigma. Like Roth, Rooker flashes out too, one weird scene in Rooker's kitchen. What the hell what that about. Things become quite heated as the film comes to wraps, with Rooker even being putting on the stand. When Rooker, is questioned as to killing Loftas, he can't answer. This movie never loses it's fire, right, up to the end, and it's killer twist. I never found any bit of the movie boring. It's solid background story is great in one hell of an underrated movie. Ellen Burstyn, as evil auntie Mook, who runs the gambling operation, where Penn's indebted to them, rules. Whatever happened to that really nice mother/actress she played the Exorcist.

    This has hints of Abel Ferrara about it (esp. the welcome appearance of the late and lamented Chris Penn from Ferrara's 'The Funeral.') I've seen this twice now, and am still not quite sure who really murdered Elizabeth. It doesn't really matter, I suppose, but there's a sense here in which style predominates a bit too strongly over substance. Michael Rooker & Tim Roth overact a bit - so the steadying presence of Chris Penn is helpful here. I'd liked to have known more about Roth's upbringing and so forth than we're granted. The scenes of him with his parents & friends are some of the best - all that baloney with lie detectors in dimly lit rooms becomes a bit dreary after a while. Nice to see 1) Michael Parks (one of the nastiest villains in Twin Peaks) - here confirming one's idea that psychiatrists and psychologists are easily more strange and conflicted than their patients, and 2) Mark Damon - most famous in American cinema from Roger Corman's Fall of the House of Usher way back in 1960! Worth an outing if you should ever get bored with the Pittsburgh Penguins, but hardly worth all the effort you need to expend in an attempt to 'work out the story.' (By the way, are all American police really like this?)

    First of all, this is not really a mystery thriller, it's more of an opportunity for the actors to chew the scenery. The plot makes no sense and the ending even less. It is pretentious in the extreme. Evidently the writers thought they were exploring the depths of the human soul and how people deceive themselves and others. Actually it's a mess. The three main characters, the suspect (Tim Roth) and the two cops are rotten to the core; in fact every character in this movie is rotten except for the prostitute/victim (Zellweger) who's an amiable dunce. A young woman has been murdered. The suspect is hooked to a lie detector and begins a game of psychological cat and mouse, the premise of which is so bogus it's impossible to sustain interest. All three, suspect and two cops, are lying and covering up unsavory parts of their lives. I got the feeling that the script was designed by postmodernists who don't believe there is any reality or any truth. This makes for terrible storytelling because if there's no reality as a reference point, there is absolutely no interest in the outcome. This is "Last Year at Marianbad" disguised as thriller. The ending doesn't make any sense because we are never told who actually committed the murder. We're given a brief scene, about five seconds, at the very end which suggests that the suspect has in fact faked his death and is revived, but that is too little to be sure of anything.

Very much like that AFI winner, The Interview, Deceiver is much more fun in the way Roth screws with you. He's the prime suspect in the murder of a high class call girl, Elizabeth Loftas (Renee Zewellger) who oozes a lot of damn sexiness, as well being a pitiable character, who you really feel sorry for, not just in her demise. There are moments in the film, and it's mainly towards the end, that you don't believe Roth is actually the killer. In his interview, where he's hounded by two cops, (Michael Rooker and Chris Penn) over a couple of days, Roth is obviously playing his own game, prolonging the interview, failing a polygraph, by faking a cough, whatever. We don't know what trick he has up his sleeve next. One scene, this game, involving cards and lies, one that Roth was obviously spose' to get caught out on, he outsmarts them, by playing funny buggers. I loved it. He's also an epileptic, we discover, this disability working to his advantage. We learn some interesting facts on epilepsy, and it's effects if mixed with this lethal drink, Roth's drunk, where a famous artist is referred as told by Michael Parks, always great, as a psychiatrist. In one violent scene, Roth explodes under pressure and begins throttling Rooker. These two cops have their own demons, Penn a gambler, Rooker, an old acquaintance of the dead hooker. Roth knows all the background of these cops, as we can see how this fits into the story, also as in Roth's plan of deception. Roth has ties with Penn's gambling friends where money can buy information. As Roth tells them "I'm filthy rich, loaded". We even have one imaginary scene in a rich dining room with Roth and his parents. They're seated, at one end of this long, table, Roth sitting at other. Obviously from this, we get the gist he's not on social grounds with his parents, or, he's just an isolated child. It's a funny scene due to some of Roth's dialogue, where he gets up, goes to his mother and stabs her, then sits back down and continues buttering his bread, some blood merging with the butter on the knife. Roth makes this movie, enjoyably entertaining, that you wouldn't want another actor to fill this character's shoes. He's so funny in many scenes, being smug and grinning loud. The relationship between Rooker and his wife (Rosanna Arquette) who's just scenery in this movie was just puzzling, like an enigma. Like Roth, Rooker flashes out too, one weird scene in Rooker's kitchen. What the hell what that about. Things become quite heated as the film comes to wraps, with Rooker even being putting on the stand. When Rooker, is questioned as to killing Loftas, he can't answer. This movie never loses it's fire, right, up to the end, and it's killer twist. I never found any bit of the movie boring. It's solid background story is great in one hell of an underrated movie. Ellen Burstyn, as evil auntie Mook, who runs the gambling operation, where Penn's indebted to them, rules. Whatever happened to that really nice mother/actress she played the Exorcist.

    This has hints of Abel Ferrara about it (esp. the welcome appearance of the late and lamented Chris Penn from Ferrara's 'The Funeral.') I've seen this twice now, and am still not quite sure who really murdered Elizabeth. It doesn't really matter, I suppose, but there's a sense here in which style predominates a bit too strongly over substance. Michael Rooker & Tim Roth overact a bit - so the steadying presence of Chris Penn is helpful here. I'd liked to have known more about Roth's upbringing and so forth than we're granted. The scenes of him with his parents & friends are some of the best - all that baloney with lie detectors in dimly lit rooms becomes a bit dreary after a while. Nice to see 1) Michael Parks (one of the nastiest villains in Twin Peaks) - here confirming one's idea that psychiatrists and psychologists are easily more strange and conflicted than their patients, and 2) Mark Damon - most famous in American cinema from Roger Corman's Fall of the House of Usher way back in 1960! Worth an outing if you should ever get bored with the Pittsburgh Penguins, but hardly worth all the effort you need to expend in an attempt to 'work out the story.' (By the way, are all American police really like this?)

    First of all, this is not really a mystery thriller, it's more of an opportunity for the actors to chew the scenery. The plot makes no sense and the ending even less. It is pretentious in the extreme. Evidently the writers thought they were exploring the depths of the human soul and how people deceive themselves and others. Actually it's a mess. The three main characters, the suspect (Tim Roth) and the two cops are rotten to the core; in fact every character in this movie is rotten except for the prostitute/victim (Zellweger) who's an amiable dunce. A young woman has been murdered. The suspect is hooked to a lie detector and begins a game of psychological cat and mouse, the premise of which is so bogus it's impossible to sustain interest. All three, suspect and two cops, are lying and covering up unsavory parts of their lives. I got the feeling that the script was designed by postmodernists who don't believe there is any reality or any truth. This makes for terrible storytelling because if there's no reality as a reference point, there is absolutely no interest in the outcome. This is "Last Year at Marianbad" disguised as thriller. The ending doesn't make any sense because we are never told who actually committed the murder. We're given a brief scene, about five seconds, at the very end which suggests that the suspect has in fact faked his death and is revived, but that is too little to be sure of anything. How could that happen? Or was that just another flashback? Since everything seems to take place in an alternate surrealistic universe, where nothing makes sense anyway, then the only thought we are left with is: "Who cares?"

The blatant anachronisms are never explained, the "twist" was anything but...and well, shoot (imdb wouldn't allow me to say spell out a different word..even when i tried to use alternative spelling-huh, what a family friendly site!), folks..save your dollar and/or time and don't bother. I'm also adding text here because my initial review was very brief--I attempted to just tell you'll that this movie stinks...but apparently I have to go on. and on. and on. so once again, don't see this movie. it stinks. it stinks. P.S. don't believe reviewers that tell you must be intelligent to "get" this movie. if you don't get it, it's because the movie failed miserably. period. period.

    CAUTION ****SPOILERS************ STARTS WITH A SPOILER! ** The staged death near the end was a bit implausible and Braxton's part was not completely explained. Seems the money he puts in the Lieutenant Kennesaw's drawer is planted to give the Lieutenant grief, but was Braxton in on it? Is the appearance of Kennesaw taking payments or bribes sufficient justice for a murderer? Especially when they had a videotape showing that Kennesaw knew the hooker and was sexually violent with her -- possibly enough to establish a solid case for homicide? So why not just have him arrested and forego the need for Wayland to go underground and lose his inheritance? Like IMDBer "Robertllr" asked, why was the staged Braxton "debt" to Mookie integral to the plot? Sure, it was a flexing by Wayland, but unnecessary. And why other than to feed one's own ego was this insidious game even played against the police, especially tormenting Kennesaw? Yes there were lots of implausibilities and possibly unexplained parts of the plots. Elisabeth was adorable and rose above the part and lines, upstaging Rosanna Arquette (Mrs. Kennesaw) who had a similar part but looked terrible in character. Shapely Elisabeth is pretty and portrayed the tenderness in her platonic bond with Wayland nicely. The shrink and Mookie are famous actors and their fairly minor parts were very well-played. Ellen Burstyn as Mookie, with that hair, looked like Cate Blanchett when she played Bob Dylan in "I'm Not There." The film showed some anti-law enforcement leanings: a guy gets routinely manhandled by two cops in the background yet visible area at the station, just outside the interrogation room. The police in my city are much smarter and better-educated than this. The polygraph team is composed of a security guard that barely finished high school, and a knotted up, jealous, insecure tough, who are openly advertising they have, can and will manipulate the testing to try to convict Wayland, and brag about how poor lie detector results have locked men up for years. The most blatant incredibility is the cops' simplistic read on Wayland's answers: OK you have admitted to lies that aren't white lies so you must be a habitual, malicious liar. When he showed them he could trick the lie detector machine by picking a playing card, and causing it to malfunction when he lied and told the truth, they naturally would have suspended the test. And the cops' remarks that you can't outsmart the machine" was ludicrous and inconsistent, as polygraph tests are not determinant. I liked everything about else this film. It wasn't as involved as Usual Suspects, and the similarities were few. I disagree with Ebert about this being about cleverness for cleverness' sake, and the plot trumping the actors. But I can't hold a candle to Ebert. Roth received a British Oscar and has been nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe. Ebert says the plot upstaged the actors and that this as a film about actors rather than characters. It's interesting that he's the star of TV's "Lie to Me," in which he's Dr. Cal Lightman, an Expert in Lies and Liars. I liked the ending. What tipped it to me was the mortician with the shiner, though the overly-long camera shot on the face of the vaguely familiar ambulance-driver only sort of evoked a little suspicion. Got it this as my free Blockbuster "oldies" flicks. What a treasure!

    This film has a very simple story, a murder is committed with only one suspect and the police are using a lie detector to try and prove he did it. The film is interesting mainly due to the performance of Roth as the suspect who is determined to prove his innocence, whether true or not, by whatever means necessary. This is a dark and smart film with both Roth and Rooker giving excellent performances. The pace is quick with tense interrogations being broken up by flashbacks and background showing a little of the problems faced by each character. The ending is a little off, it is too convenient and not as good as the rest of the writing. A good if flawed film.

    One thing you'll immediately notice about this crime thriller is its extremely dark look, this movie really makes you appreciate sunlight. All the action happens in this one really unpleasant interrogation room, only some occasional flashbacks make you remember there's a world outside, a world full of pain that is. The claustrophobic atmosphere is the strongest point to this movie, because it makes the psychological insights to our three main characters all the more interesting. Who did it isn't the main issue here, the main issue is how and when the killer will finally be caught. Eventually the eternal darkness gets tiresome, but by then the plot is actually moving someplace so it doesn't really matter. What does matter is the ending though, which I've seen quite a lot of times before, often better written. That is to me the only disappointment to this movie, the predictability of the ending. Other than that it's a nice piece of atmosphere.

    An extremely dirty movie. Everything is dirty: a horrid crime where the victim is a prostitute and the main suspect is a rich young epileptic with no moral boundaries who drinks drugs down with absinthe. The investigation is led by a gambler and a man haunted by his own dark ghosts, threatening to destroy his marriage. The operator's work is also dirty, the picture is dark, people's faces reveal more and more animalistic features of their owners, turning the all in monsters by the end of the film. The investigation spiraling out of control reveals increasingly dirty details of the case. The end is shocking in it's cruelty. This movie may be crossing a moral verge of our perception of "dirt", making us watch it till the end never taking our eyes off the screen. It reaches it's goad - we become engrossed in the "dirt", seduced by it's dark appeal. An exquisitely dirty movie.

    This movie is a hidden treasure . A clever and dark psychological thriller . It reminds me of a movie that David Fincher ("Se7en") would have made if he was in shape . "The Liar" or "The Deceiver" as the movie is sometimes known is an intriguing movie that keeps you at the edge of your seat. This is an example of movie in which you can have three people talking in one room and you can't take your eyes off screen. The movie is really dark and full of tension. You can never know what will happens next and what dark secret will be revealed. You must figure out for yourself what is true and what is lie. Tim Ruth is great as the main hero (?) who toys with other people minds. He is really one strange guy. Chris Penn gives a really good support in a rather standard role of not too bright cop. The real star here is Michael Rooker who is AMAZING . His performance deserves an Oscar. You have to see it for yourself. Renee Zellweger and Ellen Burstyn also give quite memorable performances. Great movie . A pearl . I give it 8/10.

    Deceiver (AKA: Liar) is directed and written by Jonas and Josh Pate. It stars Tim Roth, Chris Penn, Michael Rooker, Ellen Burstyn, Ren&eacute;e Zellweger and Rosanna Arquette. Music is by Harry Gregson-Williams and cinematography by Bill Butler. The gruesome murder of a prostitute finds chief suspect James Wayland (Roth) in an interrogation room undergoing a lie detector test. Two detectives, Phillip Braxton (Penn) and Edward Kennesaw (Rooker), are overseeing the test and sure of Wayland's guilt. But they are soon to find that Wayland is no push over and as the mind games start, dark secrets begin to come into play... Without doubt it's an acquired taste, met with indifference upon its release and still causing debates on internet forums, Deceiver is one of those films that infuriates and fascinates in equal measure. As the title of the film suggests, deception and untruths are the order of the day here, not just in the claustrophobic interrogation room, but also in how the brothers Pate toy with us the audience. With its reliance on a non linear structure and convoluted plot, focusing the attention is greatly required, especially since the use of a rug-pull device will either seal or kill the deal. As the walls close in on the interrogation room sequences and the flashbacks and character subplots flit in and out of the tale, the Pate brothers bring striking photography and angles into play. Sometimes it's a POV camera technique that has an edginess that seems to be probing for a crack in the armour of the person it looks at, at other instances it's distorted backdrops that run concurrently with the psychological chaos buzzing around the sweat tinged room. While the dialogue the characters are given crackles with the hard-boiled intensity that graced many a 40s and 50s noir thriller. With a trio of superb lead male performances leading the way and a narrative loaded with duplicity and deviousness, Deceiver is crackerjack neo-noir. It's guilty of excess at times, and it's not hard to understand why some find the trickery too much to bare, but for those who like labyrinthine crime thrillers then this hits the spot. In fact! Repeat viewing is very much recommended. 8/10

Who did it isn't the main issue here, the main issue is how and when the killer will finally be caught. Eventually the eternal darkness gets tiresome, but by then the plot is actually moving someplace so it doesn't really matter. What does matter is the ending though, which I've seen quite a lot of times before, often better written. That is to me the only disappointment to this movie, the predictability of the ending. Other than that it's a nice piece of atmosphere.

    An extremely dirty movie. Everything is dirty: a horrid crime where the victim is a prostitute and the main suspect is a rich young epileptic with no moral boundaries who drinks drugs down with absinthe. The investigation is led by a gambler and a man haunted by his own dark ghosts, threatening to destroy his marriage. The operator's work is also dirty, the picture is dark, people's faces reveal more and more animalistic features of their owners, turning the all in monsters by the end of the film. The investigation spiraling out of control reveals increasingly dirty details of the case. The end is shocking in it's cruelty. This movie may be crossing a moral verge of our perception of "dirt", making us watch it till the end never taking our eyes off the screen. It reaches it's goad - we become engrossed in the "dirt", seduced by it's dark appeal. An exquisitely dirty movie.

    This movie is a hidden treasure . A clever and dark psychological thriller . It reminds me of a movie that David Fincher ("Se7en") would have made if he was in shape . "The Liar" or "The Deceiver" as the movie is sometimes known is an intriguing movie that keeps you at the edge of your seat. This is an example of movie in which you can have three people talking in one room and you can't take your eyes off screen. The movie is really dark and full of tension. You can never know what will happens next and what dark secret will be revealed. You must figure out for yourself what is true and what is lie. Tim Ruth is great as the main hero (?) who toys with other people minds. He is really one strange guy. Chris Penn gives a really good support in a rather standard role of not too bright cop. The real star here is Michael Rooker who is AMAZING . His performance deserves an Oscar. You have to see it for yourself. Renee Zellweger and Ellen Burstyn also give quite memorable performances. Great movie . A pearl . I give it 8/10.

    Deceiver (AKA: Liar) is directed and written by Jonas and Josh Pate. It stars Tim Roth, Chris Penn, Michael Rooker, Ellen Burstyn, Ren&eacute;e Zellweger and Rosanna Arquette. Music is by Harry Gregson-Williams and cinematography by Bill Butler. The gruesome murder of a prostitute finds chief suspect James Wayland (Roth) in an interrogation room undergoing a lie detector test. Two detectives, Phillip Braxton (Penn) and Edward Kennesaw (Rooker), are overseeing the test and sure of Wayland's guilt. But they are soon to find that Wayland is no push over and as the mind games start, dark secrets begin to come into play... Without doubt it's an acquired taste, met with indifference upon its release and still causing debates on internet forums, Deceiver is one of those films that infuriates and fascinates in equal measure. As the title of the film suggests, deception and untruths are the order of the day here, not just in the claustrophobic interrogation room, but also in how the brothers Pate toy with us the audience. With its reliance on a non linear structure and convoluted plot, focusing the attention is greatly required, especially since the use of a rug-pull device will either seal or kill the deal. As the walls close in on the interrogation room sequences and the flashbacks and character subplots flit in and out of the tale, the Pate brothers bring striking photography and angles into play. Sometimes it's a POV camera technique that has an edginess that seems to be probing for a crack in the armour of the person it looks at, at other instances it's distorted backdrops that run concurrently with the psychological chaos buzzing around the sweat tinged room. While the dialogue the characters are given crackles with the hard-boiled intensity that graced many a 40s and 50s noir thriller. With a trio of superb lead male performances leading the way and a narrative loaded with duplicity and deviousness, Deceiver is crackerjack neo-noir. It's guilty of excess at times, and it's not hard to understand why some find the trickery too much to bare, but for those who like labyrinthine crime thrillers then this hits the spot. In fact! Repeat viewing is very much recommended. 8/10

    Deceiver is another of these must see movies. It's one of my top ten favorites. The movie works partially because of the solid performances from it's leads, Roth, an actor who never disappoints, the best of the three. Very much like that AFI winner, The Interview, Deceiver is much more fun in the way Roth screws with you. He's the prime suspect in the murder of a high class call girl, Elizabeth Loftas (Renee Zewellger) who oozes a lot of damn sexiness, as well being a pitiable character, who you really feel sorry for, not just in her demise. There are moments in the film, and it's mainly towards the end, that you don't believe Roth is actually the killer. In his interview, where he's hounded by two cops, (Michael Rooker and Chris Penn) over a couple of days, Roth is obviously playing his own game, prolonging the interview, failing a polygraph, by faking a cough, whatever. We don't know what trick he has up his sleeve next. One scene, this game, involving cards and lies, one that Roth was obviously spose' to get caught out on, he outsmarts them, by playing funny buggers. I loved it. He's also an epileptic, we discover, this disability working to his advantage. We learn some interesting facts on epilepsy, and it's effects if mixed with this lethal drink, Roth's drunk, where a famous artist is referred as told by Michael Parks, always great, as a psychiatrist. In one violent scene, Roth explodes under pressure and begins throttling Rooker. These two cops have their own demons, Penn a gambler, Rooker, an old acquaintance of the dead hooker. Roth knows all the background of these cops, as we can see how this fits into the story, also as in Roth's plan of deception. Roth has ties with Penn's gambling friends where money can buy information. As Roth tells them "I'm filthy rich, loaded". We even have one imaginary scene in a rich dining room with Roth and his parents. They're seated, at one end of this long, table, Roth sitting at other. Obviously from this, we get the gist he's not on social grounds with his parents, or, he's just an isolated child. It's a funny scene due to some of Roth's dialogue, where he gets up, goes to his mother and stabs her, then sits back down and continues buttering his bread, some blood merging with the butter on the knife. Roth makes this movie, enjoyably entertaining, that you wouldn't want another actor to fill this character's shoes. He's so funny in many scenes, being smug and grinning loud. The relationship between Rooker and his wife (Rosanna Arquette) who's just scenery in this movie was just puzzling, like an enigma. Like Roth, Rooker flashes out too, one weird scene in Rooker's kitchen. What the hell what that about. Things become quite heated as the film comes to wraps, with Rooker even being putting on the stand. When Rooker, is questioned as to killing Loftas, he can't answer. This movie never loses it's fire, right, up to the end, and it's killer twist. I never found any bit of the movie boring. It's solid background story is great in one hell of an underrated movie. Ellen Burstyn, as evil auntie Mook, who runs the gambling operation, where Penn's indebted to them, rules. Whatever happened to that really nice mother/actress she played the Exorcist.

    This has hints of Abel Ferrara about it (esp. the welcome appearance of the late and lamented Chris Penn from Ferrara's 'The Funeral.') I've seen this twice now, and am still not quite sure who really murdered Elizabeth. It doesn't really matter, I suppose, but there's a sense here in which style predominates a bit too strongly over substance. Michael Rooker & Tim Roth overact a bit - so the steadying presence of Chris Penn is helpful here. I'd liked to have known more about Roth's upbringing and so forth than we're granted. The scenes of him with his parents & friends are some of the best - all that baloney with lie detectors in dimly lit rooms becomes a bit dreary after a while. Nice to see 1) Michael Parks (one of the nastiest villains in Twin Peaks) - here confirming one's idea that psychiatrists and psychologists are easily more strange and conflicted than their patients, and 2) Mark Damon - most famous in American cinema from Roger Corman's Fall of the House of Usher way back in 1960! Worth an outing if you should ever get bored with the Pittsburgh Penguins, but hardly worth all the effort you need to expend in an attempt to 'work out the story.' (By the way, are all American police really like this?)

    First of all, this is not really a mystery thriller, it's more of an opportunity for the actors to chew the scenery. The plot makes no sense and the ending even less. It is pretentious in the extreme. Evidently the writers thought they were exploring the depths of the human soul and how people deceive themselves and others. Actually it's a mess. The three main characters, the suspect (Tim Roth) and the two cops are rotten to the core; in fact every character in this movie is rotten except for the prostitute/victim (Zellweger) who's an amiable dunce. A young woman has been murdered. The suspect is hooked to a lie detector and begins a game of psychological cat and mouse, the premise of which is so bogus it's impossible to sustain interest. All three, suspect and two cops, are lying and covering up unsavory parts of their lives. I got the feeling that the script was designed by postmodernists who don't believe there is any reality or any truth. This makes for terrible storytelling because if there's no reality as a reference point, there is absolutely no interest in the outcome. This is "Last Year at Marianbad" disguised as thriller. The ending doesn't make any sense because we are never told who actually committed the murder. We're given a brief scene, about five seconds, at the very end which suggests that the suspect has in fact faked his death and is revived, but that is too little to be sure of anything. How could that happen? Or was that just another flashback? Since everything seems to take place in an alternate surrealistic universe, where nothing makes sense anyway, then the only thought we are left with is: "Who cares?"

    ..with celebrities such as Tim Roth, Renee Z, and Chris Penn...I have the answer. This movie was beyond horrible. The blatant anachronisms are never explained, the "twist" was anything but...and well, shoot (imdb wouldn't allow me to say spell out a different word..even when i tried to use alternative spelling-huh, what a family friendly site!), folks..save your dollar and/or time and don't bother. I'm also adding text here because my initial review was very brief--I attempted to just tell you'll that this movie stinks...but apparently I have to go on. and on. and on. so once again, don't see this movie. it stinks. it stinks. P.S. don't believe reviewers that tell you must be intelligent to "get" this movie. if you don't get it, it's because the movie failed miserably. period. period.

    CAUTION ****SPOILERS************ STARTS WITH A SPOILER! ** The staged death near the end was a bit implausible and Braxton's part was not completely explained. Seems the money he puts in the Lieutenant Kennesaw's drawer is planted to give the Lieutenant grief, but was Braxton in on it? Is the appearance of Kennesaw taking payments or bribes sufficient justice for a murderer? Especially when they had a videotape showing that Kennesaw knew the hooker and was sexually violent with her -- possibly enough to establish a solid case for homicide? So why not just have him arrested and forego the need for Wayland to go underground and lose his inheritance? Like IMDBer "Robertllr" asked, why was the staged Braxton "debt" to Mookie integral to the plot? Sure, it was a flexing by Wayland, but unnecessary. And why other than to feed one's own ego was this insidious game even played against the police, especially tormenting Kennesaw? Yes there were lots of implausibilities and possibly unexplained parts of the plots. Elisabeth was adorable and rose above the part and lines, upstaging Rosanna Arquette (Mrs. Kennesaw) who had a similar part but looked terrible in character. Shapely Elisabeth is pretty and portrayed the tenderness in her platonic bond with Wayland nicely. The shrink and Mookie are famous actors and their fairly minor parts were very well-played. Ellen Burstyn as Mookie, with that hair, looked like Cate Blanchett when she played Bob Dylan in "I'm Not There." The film showed some anti-law enforcement leanings: a guy gets routinely manhandled by two cops in the background yet visible area at the station, just outside the interrogation room. The police in my city are much smarter and better-educated than this. The polygraph team is composed of a security guard that barely finished high school, and a knotted up, jealous, insecure tough, who are openly advertising they have, can and will manipulate the testing to try to convict Wayland, and brag about how poor lie detector results have locked men up for years. The most blatant incredibility is the cops' simplistic read on Wayland's answers: OK you have admitted to lies that aren't white lies so you must be a habitual, malicious liar. When he showed them he could trick the lie detector machine by picking a playing card, and causing it to malfunction when he lied and told the truth, they naturally would have suspended the test. And the cops' remarks that you can't outsmart the machine" was ludicrous and inconsistent, as polygraph tests are not determinant. I liked everything about else this film. It wasn't as involved as Usual Suspects, and the similarities were few. I disagree with Ebert about this being about cleverness for cleverness' sake, and the plot trumping the actors. But I can't hold a candle to Ebert. Roth received a British Oscar and has been nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe. Ebert says the plot upstaged the actors and that this as a film about actors rather than characters. It's interesting that he's the star of TV's "Lie to Me," in which he's Dr. Cal Lightman, an Expert in Lies and Liars. I liked the ending. What tipped it to me was the mortician with the shiner, though the overly-long camera shot on the face of the vaguely familiar ambulance-driver only sort of evoked a little suspicion. Got it this as my free Blockbuster "oldies" flicks. What a treasure!

    This film has a very simple story, a murder is committed with only one suspect and the police are using a lie detector to try and prove he did it. The film is interesting mainly due to the performance of Roth as the suspect who is determined to prove his innocence, whether true or not, by whatever means necessary. This is a dark and smart film with both Roth and Rooker giving excellent performances. The pace is quick with tense interrogations being broken up by flashbacks and background showing a little of the problems faced by each character. The ending is a little off, it is too convenient and not as good as the rest of the writing. A good if flawed film.

    ..with celebrities such as Tim Roth, Renee Z, and Chris Penn...I have the answer. This movie was beyond horrible. The blatant anachronisms are never explained, the "twist" was anything but...and well, shoot (imdb wouldn't allow me to say spell out a different word..even when i tried to use alternative spelling-huh, what a family friendly site!), folks..save your dollar and/or time and don't bother. I'm also adding text here because my initial review was very brief--I attempted to just tell you'll that this movie stinks...but apparently I have to go on. and on. and on. so once again, don't see this movie. it stinks. it stinks. P.S. don't believe reviewers that tell you must be intelligent to "get" this movie. if you don't get it, it's because the movie failed miserably. period. period.

    CAUTION ****SPOILERS************ STARTS WITH A SPOILER! ** The staged death near the end was a bit implausible and Braxton's part was not completely explained. Seems the money he puts in the Lieutenant Kennesaw's drawer is planted to give the Lieutenant grief, but was Braxton in on it? Is the appearance of Kennesaw taking payments or bribes sufficient justice for a murderer? Especially when they had a videotape showing that Kennesaw knew the hooker and was sexually violent with her -- possibly enough to establish a solid case for homicide? So why not just have him arrested and forego the need for Wayland to go underground and lose his inheritance? Like IMDBer "Robertllr" asked, why was the staged Braxton "debt" to Mookie integral to the plot? Sure, it was a flexing by Wayland, but unnecessary. And why other than to feed one's own ego was this insidious game even played against the police, especially tormenting Kennesaw? Yes there were lots of implausibilities and possibly unexplained parts of the plots. Elisabeth was adorable and rose above the part and lines, upstaging Rosanna Arquette (Mrs. Kennesaw) who had a similar part but looked terrible in character. Shapely Elisabeth is pretty and portrayed the tenderness in her platonic bond with Wayland nicely. The shrink and Mookie are famous actors and their fairly minor parts were very well-played. Ellen Burstyn as Mookie, with that hair, looked like Cate Blanchett when she played Bob Dylan in "I'm Not There." The film showed some anti-law enforcement leanings: a guy gets routinely manhandled by two cops in the background yet visible area at the station, just outside the interrogation room. The police in my city are much smarter and better-educated than this. The polygraph team is composed of a security guard that barely finished high school, and a knotted up, jealous, insecure tough, who are openly advertising they have, can and will manipulate the testing to try to convict Wayland, and brag about how poor lie detector results have locked men up for years. The most blatant incredibility is the cops' simplistic read on Wayland's answers: OK you have admitted to lies that aren't white lies so you must be a habitual, malicious liar. When he showed them he could trick the lie detector machine by picking a playing card, and causing it to malfunction when he lied and told the truth, they naturally would have suspended the test. And the cops' remarks that you can't outsmart the machine" was ludicrous and inconsistent, as polygraph tests are not determinant. I liked everything about else this film. It wasn't as involved as Usual Suspects, and the similarities were few. I disagree with Ebert about this being about cleverness for cleverness' sake, and the plot trumping the actors. But I can't hold a candle to Ebert. Roth received a British Oscar and has been nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe. Ebert says the plot upstaged the actors and that this as a film about actors rather than characters. It's interesting that he's the star of TV's "Lie to Me," in which he's Dr. Cal Lightman, an Expert in Lies and Liars. I liked the ending. What tipped it to me was the mortician with the shiner, though the overly-long camera shot on the face of the vaguely familiar ambulance-driver only sort of evoked a little suspicion. Got it this as my free Blockbuster "oldies" flicks. What a treasure!

    This film has a very simple story, a murder is committed with only one suspect and the police are using a lie detector to try and prove he did it. The film is interesting mainly due to the performance of Roth as the suspect who is determined to prove his innocence, whether true or not, by whatever means necessary. This is a dark and smart film with both Roth and Rooker giving excellent performances. The pace is quick with tense interrogations being broken up by flashbacks and background showing a little of the problems faced by each character. The ending is a little off, it is too convenient and not as good as the rest of the writing. A good if flawed film.

    One thing you'll immediately notice about this crime thriller is its extremely dark look, this movie really makes you appreciate sunlight. All the action happens in this one really unpleasant interrogation room, only some occasional flashbacks make you remember there's a world outside, a world full of pain that is. The claustrophobic atmosphere is the strongest point to this movie, because it makes the psychological insights to our three main characters all the more interesting. Who did it isn't the main issue here, the main issue is how and when the killer will finally be caught. Eventually the eternal darkness gets tiresome, but by then the plot is actually moving someplace so it doesn't really matter. What does matter is the ending though, which I've seen quite a lot of times before, often better written. That is to me the only disappointment to this movie, the predictability of the ending. Other than that it's a nice piece of atmosphere.

    An extremely dirty movie. Everything is dirty: a horrid crime where the victim is a prostitute and the main suspect is a rich young epileptic with no moral boundaries who drinks drugs down with absinthe. The investigation is led by a gambler and a man haunted by his own dark ghosts, threatening to destroy his marriage. The operator's work is also dirty, the picture is dark, people's faces reveal more and more animalistic features of their owners, turning the all in monsters by the end of the film. The investigation spiraling out of control reveals increasingly dirty details of the case. The end is shocking in it's cruelty. This movie may be crossing a moral verge of our perception of "dirt", making us watch it till the end never taking our eyes off the screen. It reaches it's goad - we become engrossed in the "dirt", seduced by it's dark appeal. An exquisitely dirty movie.
