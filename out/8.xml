    This is a story of a little pig. His name is Babe. Arthur who is a famer got Babe in Harvest festival and he takes care of him. His farm has so many animals. The life of Babe with many animals in farm starts. I like this movie so much. All animals are so pretty. We can hear that the animals talk. Of course, the human in the movie cannot hear the voice of animals. Babe is kind to everyone, he is really pure and he tackles everything with all his efforts. Therefor I like Babe so much. And I love his friends in farm too. When Babe is in trouble, his friends do them best to help him. That made me happy. This movie tells me the importance of friends. This is a heart-warming film. I recommend you to watch this movie. This story will make you smile and feel happy.

    A pig, Babe, is taken to a farm and is taken care of by the farmers for eating. There, there are various animals which have great originality. The husband comes to like Babe and he tries to take part in sheepdog contest with Babe. Of course, everyone make a fool of them, but the husband believes Babe's ability. I love pig! Their bottom is cute! I felt interesting that a human and a pig feel their destiny. The combination that a pig and a dog, or a pig and a duck is amusing. The animals get terrified that they are eaten by farmers. Certainly, eating is killing for animals. I got to feel that that action is cruel. Babe is a obedient and good pig, therefore everyone come to love him. His character is wonderful. The husband is also nice because he cheers Babe hard. I could know that how he cherishes his animals. This is a heart warming story. You can have happy feelings.

    This movie is for family and children but it is enough for adults to enjoy watching the movie. One day, a pig is received by a old man as a prize. At first, the man think the pig will for a dinner on Christmas day. The pig is raised by sheepdogs and the old man at a stock farm. The scene is calm. There are many animals with the pig. The pig, named Babe is very clever so I was fascinated with Babe. The old man is kind so he loves the pig gradually. The pig succeed in many things and he get to be trusted by other animals. What I liked in this movie is that all animals can speak fluently like people, it was nice and very interesting. The expressions are just like animals have real feelings. The musics witch are used in the movie are also nice. After watching this movie, I thought each animal has their heats and feeling. Animals also have their society and classes. We should be friendly with animals more even mice. Since I watched this movie at only 5 years old for the first time, I watched this movie many times. If you watch this movie, you must think animals are so lovely. You will also be fascinated with Babe and other animals.

    One day, a farmer won a contest guessing the weight of a pig and he brings the pig to his farm. This film is about the growth of the pig. The pig is called Babe by other animals and he is very cute, honest and moderate, so everyone loves him. I like his smile because his smile makes me warm emotion. As I said, this story describes the growth of Babe. He tries to become like a shepherd dog though he is a pig. I think that this story describes that it is important to pursue dreams even if it seems to be impossible or difficult and also tells us the importance of holding a pure but steady and firm mind for our own dreams. I recommend everyone to watch the film because not only Babe is cute but also this film tells us the very important things in our life.

    Babe is a great movie with a really sweet storyline,a great voice cast as well as an inspired performance by James Cromwell and some very likable and memorable characters.The movie is a great movie for the whole famly,it has enough in it to entertain both younger and older audiences.I certainly don't think that is a Best Picture nominee,although it did definitely deserve the Academy Award Best Visual Effects as the movie is very well made.These talking animal films are usually only fun for children,but Babe has enough in it for the entire family to enjoy and I would highly recommend it as a film for the whole family to watch. Farmer Hoggett (James Cromwell) trains a pig who was taken away from his mother and grew up with sheepdogs,to herd sheep himself.

    Babe was one of the very first films that I watched during childhood, it tells the story about a juvenile pig (The "Babe" of the title.) who is trained to become a sheepdog (Well, a "sheeppig" really.) in order to avoid the slaughter house. Babe encounters some dangerous escapades, so he learns the dangers of life, like any child would if they were entering the real life world. I liked this film; especially its brilliant animatronics, it won for best special effects in 1995, and it really deserved that award. James Cromwell's performance as Farmer Hoggett was also stunning. The music fitted the mood of the film very well, even if the instrumental for "If I had Words" felt very repetitive, it was a great piece of music that the film boosted its heartstrings-pulling potential with. My only drawback was the singing mice who narrated the chapter titles, they made me cringe; but it still didn't stop me from enjoying this wonderful, wonderful movie. I give it an eight. 9/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    - A I am not a favorite of films with the little stories inside a big motion picture, but the stories in this one are so well done that it didn't bother me and made appreciate the film even more. All the animals are lovable with their own personalities. The story is silly, but in a fun, family friendly way of a pig thinking he's a dog and then acts like one throughout with the hilarious ending at the dog show. This was an excellent film that had tough competition for best picture but easily one of the best family films for all ages. Don't judge it as an animal film, it may surprise you.

    An inspiring, wonderful, sad, funny, poetic film which is nothing less than No.4 in my all time list. Pork is my favourite meat, and I almost gave it up over this... until common sense kicked in. There is no more charming and humble hero than the title porker, and with the aid of a bit of blue screen technology which creates the illusion that they can talk, him and his farmyard buddies create a cast that put 99.999999% of human casts to shame with their wit and intelligence. It's just one of those magical movies where everything works... Even James Cromwell's cheesy impromptu dance to help cheer a sick Babe up is a splendid, life-affirming moment. But it doesn't shy away from the darker side either, as the sight of abattoir slaughter and a sheep being ripped apart by dogs remind us that life is not all sunshine and lollypops. I could fill an encyclopedia on all the thing I adore about this lovely, lovely film, but the fact I'm not ending the review with a sarcastic quip should be a good indicator that this truly is, something very special indeed. 10/10

    This is a film that is Art. I held back from seeing it because I hate jumping on bandwagons or going along with the crowd about anything, but I was surprised when I found myself welling up with tears even before the beginning credits completely rolled past. Something was coming that was completely disarming and I could already sense that. A story that could not be confronted behind a social mask or cultural pose of any kind. It went past all the carefully constructed chains of reason and straight for the heart. Before I saw this film, I never understood what people meant by the '- end of childhood innocence -'. After this film, I realized it had something to do with other living beings dying so that you could thrive in your survival. This being an unalterable Fact of Life. It also has to do with slaughterhouses, wringing chickens' necks, cracking eggs open and frying their contents before these fully develop into chicks and pickled pigs feet and bacon. In other words, Life and Death are inextricably bound up in the warp and woof of existence on this planet. 'Babe' is about those precious childhood moments where everything that benefits us seems to be bestowed upon us by the magic of our parents and there is no death. No awareness that ears of corn and cabbages sacrifice themselves for us at the fullest flowering of their development so that we can have popcorn and coleslaw. Set it out that way and you have the angst of adolescence. The realization that even the best intentions and the most wholesome living does not exempt us from facing the vicissitudes that lead to the Grim Reaper eventually paying us a call. It takes the punch out of the joke and the life out of the party. I remember in a film called 'The Misfits' Marilyn Monroe got all upset because Clark Gable was roping Mustangs out on the open plains to be turned into dog food. She would rant and have tantrums about it, but it all seemed so very childish. Like someone or some teacher never sat her down and explained to her about the Food Chain. The point being of course that she was not protesting about the Mustangs at all, but about some universe where Mustangs rope humans and turn them into food for some kind of pets they are harboring. After all, what goes around comes around, doesn't it? She just didn't want to end up someone's favorite recipe in a cookbook somewhere. She was wondering, as children often do without being fully able to articulate it, why we can't all just get along without killing and eating each other? But what if there was a way out of all this killing and eating that's so lip smacking good? 'Babe' lightly and gently explores this question. While holding back the answer that the adults keep to themselves. That bacon will still fry even as Babe lives.

    "Babe" resurrects a kind of magic we thought to have disappeared since the glorious age of Walt Disney classics. It's an animal-centered movie but through its inspirational story and endearing sweetness, remains closer to "Bambi" and "Dumbo" than "The Jungle Book" or even "The Lion King". "Babe" is the name of a little pig that grew up in an Australian farm owned by Arthur Hogget (James Cromwell) and dreamed of becoming a sheep dog. But there's a time to get to that dream, and the director Chris Noonan starts by immersing us into the farm, it's in Australia, but as a matter of fact, it can be any farm, as imagined by any child from any place in the world. Farm in "Babe" is not just a beautiful dream-like setting, it happens to be a codified universe where each species has a specific place depending on its utility. The rooster wakes up the farmer, the hens make eggs, cows give milk, dogs herd the sheep, cat chase mice, horses transport etc. In this hierarchy, pigs are in the bottom, their only purpose being to grow up, to get fat so they can be eaten and go to Paradise, a place so beautiful no pig ever came back from. The film deals with pigs' fate with a gravity that mirrors the dramatic death of Bambi's mother, but also through comedy with the unforgettable Ferdinand the Duck who tries to replace the rooster to be spared from being eaten. Babe is an outcast, but like "Dumbo" and in a lesser measure "Pinocchio", in the gentle sense of the word. Indeed, he wants to be useful, to be part of the farm's collective effort. The charm of "Babe" is to create a character to which any kid can identify with; inspired by the idea of following their dreams no matter how silly they sound. But nothing is silly when handled in a smooth and sensitive way. Babe respects the order and the leadership of Rex, the male sheepdog, he plays with Rex and his female Fly's puppies, but they have the right to be in home, along with the cat, but he can't. This feeling of rejection is the cement of kids' personalities because it's a way for children to determine what they can bring to the others. The story goes on, punctuated by the songs of three little mice, with a high-pitched voice that make anything they say irresistible to the ears. The film is an extraordinary achievement as it really focuses on animals' feelings more than their actions. In a sad scene where Rex and Fly's puppies are sold, you could see the sadness in the two parent's eyes, and ironically, Rex, the hard-nosed and grouchy one seemed to be most devastated, we'd learn later than he'd already experience loss. The 'puppies' scene isn't shot in an overly dramatic way because its main purpose is to show that even the sheepdogs must deal with some aspects of their lives they don't necessary like. The second purpose is to build the relationship between Babe and Fly. As a new adoptive mother, Fly believes that Babe can make a good replacement for Rex, who never won a championship since the day he lost sheep during a pouring rain and became almost deaf. The farm owner, Hogget, sees the same potential in Babe and decides to give him a chance. Why? As the narrator says: "These little ideas that tickled and nagged and refused to go away should never be ignored for in them lie the seeds of destiny", that's the kind of movie quotes that takes you by surprise and displays a level of smartness that can appeal to both kids and adults. Also, it starts off the core of the story, which is less the coming-of-age of Babe than the beautiful relationship between the little pig and his master. James Cromwell, was rightfully Oscar-nominated for Best Supporting Actor because this is the kind of role you can't cheat on. It might be easy to pretend to talk to a pig, but there are emotions that cannot be feigned, and the look on Cromwell's eyes in some scenes betrayed a genuine attachment. But again, it's not that easy to make out of a pig, a believable sheep dog. In a key scene, Fly orders Babe to shout at the sheep, to be more aggressive. After all, he's still a pig, his master might change his mind: it's still a life-and-death situation. That was the make it or break it part of the script, had Babe commanded the sheep through violence, the film would have lost me. Naturally, "Babe" respects both the children and the adult's intelligence by not operating a 180&deg; turn on its character. Babe is first mocked but it's by talking to the sheep gently, by explaining what he wants to Maa, the older one, that he gets what he wants. The point is not to teach that being nice might open every door, but that sometimes you get to better results by getting things your way. It's about respecting the others, and not assuming someone's silly or wouldn't understand because he or she's different. The dogs are constantly insulting sheep but a very clever twist reveals at the end, that the sheep doesn't think much of the dogs either, both prejudices being due to some ancestral conditioning. If anything, Babe is a lesson of humility, gentleness and perseverance. The ending can come as predictable but there's more in the film than a simple plot. it's about self-acceptance, respect before inspiring the recognition and the love of people that count in our lives, something powerfully conveyed by the Cromwell's face with his "That'll do, pig. That'll do". And from a man of few words, each one carried the same magical resonance than the moment where Pinocchio became a real boy and Dumbo started flying in the circus.

The point being of course that she was not protesting about the Mustangs at all, but about some universe where Mustangs rope humans and turn them into food for some kind of pets they are harboring. After all, what goes around comes around, doesn't it? She just didn't want to end up someone's favorite recipe in a cookbook somewhere. She was wondering, as children often do without being fully able to articulate it, why we can't all just get along without killing and eating each other? But what if there was a way out of all this killing and eating that's so lip smacking good? 'Babe' lightly and gently explores this question. While holding back the answer that the adults keep to themselves. That bacon will still fry even as Babe lives.

    "Babe" resurrects a kind of magic we thought to have disappeared since the glorious age of Walt Disney classics. It's an animal-centered movie but through its inspirational story and endearing sweetness, remains closer to "Bambi" and "Dumbo" than "The Jungle Book" or even "The Lion King". "Babe" is the name of a little pig that grew up in an Australian farm owned by Arthur Hogget (James Cromwell) and dreamed of becoming a sheep dog. But there's a time to get to that dream, and the director Chris Noonan starts by immersing us into the farm, it's in Australia, but as a matter of fact, it can be any farm, as imagined by any child from any place in the world. Farm in "Babe" is not just a beautiful dream-like setting, it happens to be a codified universe where each species has a specific place depending on its utility. The rooster wakes up the farmer, the hens make eggs, cows give milk, dogs herd the sheep, cat chase mice, horses transport etc. In this hierarchy, pigs are in the bottom, their only purpose being to grow up, to get fat so they can be eaten and go to Paradise, a place so beautiful no pig ever came back from. The film deals with pigs' fate with a gravity that mirrors the dramatic death of Bambi's mother, but also through comedy with the unforgettable Ferdinand the Duck who tries to replace the rooster to be spared from being eaten. Babe is an outcast, but like "Dumbo" and in a lesser measure "Pinocchio", in the gentle sense of the word. Indeed, he wants to be useful, to be part of the farm's collective effort. The charm of "Babe" is to create a character to which any kid can identify with; inspired by the idea of following their dreams no matter how silly they sound. But nothing is silly when handled in a smooth and sensitive way. Babe respects the order and the leadership of Rex, the male sheepdog, he plays with Rex and his female Fly's puppies, but they have the right to be in home, along with the cat, but he can't. This feeling of rejection is the cement of kids' personalities because it's a way for children to determine what they can bring to the others. The story goes on, punctuated by the songs of three little mice, with a high-pitched voice that make anything they say irresistible to the ears. The film is an extraordinary achievement as it really focuses on animals' feelings more than their actions. In a sad scene where Rex and Fly's puppies are sold, you could see the sadness in the two parent's eyes, and ironically, Rex, the hard-nosed and grouchy one seemed to be most devastated, we'd learn later than he'd already experience loss. The 'puppies' scene isn't shot in an overly dramatic way because its main purpose is to show that even the sheepdogs must deal with some aspects of their lives they don't necessary like. The second purpose is to build the relationship between Babe and Fly. As a new adoptive mother, Fly believes that Babe can make a good replacement for Rex, who never won a championship since the day he lost sheep during a pouring rain and became almost deaf. The farm owner, Hogget, sees the same potential in Babe and decides to give him a chance. Why? As the narrator says: "These little ideas that tickled and nagged and refused to go away should never be ignored for in them lie the seeds of destiny", that's the kind of movie quotes that takes you by surprise and displays a level of smartness that can appeal to both kids and adults. Also, it starts off the core of the story, which is less the coming-of-age of Babe than the beautiful relationship between the little pig and his master. James Cromwell, was rightfully Oscar-nominated for Best Supporting Actor because this is the kind of role you can't cheat on. It might be easy to pretend to talk to a pig, but there are emotions that cannot be feigned, and the look on Cromwell's eyes in some scenes betrayed a genuine attachment. But again, it's not that easy to make out of a pig, a believable sheep dog. In a key scene, Fly orders Babe to shout at the sheep, to be more aggressive. After all, he's still a pig, his master might change his mind: it's still a life-and-death situation. That was the make it or break it part of the script, had Babe commanded the sheep through violence, the film would have lost me. Naturally, "Babe" respects both the children and the adult's intelligence by not operating a 180&deg; turn on its character. Babe is first mocked but it's by talking to the sheep gently, by explaining what he wants to Maa, the older one, that he gets what he wants. The point is not to teach that being nice might open every door, but that sometimes you get to better results by getting things your way. It's about respecting the others, and not assuming someone's silly or wouldn't understand because he or she's different. The dogs are constantly insulting sheep but a very clever twist reveals at the end, that the sheep doesn't think much of the dogs either, both prejudices being due to some ancestral conditioning. If anything, Babe is a lesson of humility, gentleness and perseverance. The ending can come as predictable but there's more in the film than a simple plot. it's about self-acceptance, respect before inspiring the recognition and the love of people that count in our lives, something powerfully conveyed by the Cromwell's face with his "That'll do, pig. That'll do". And from a man of few words, each one carried the same magical resonance than the moment where Pinocchio became a real boy and Dumbo started flying in the circus.

    A pig, Babe, is taken to a farm and is taken care of by the farmers for eating. There, there are various animals which have great originality. The husband comes to like Babe and he tries to take part in sheepdog contest with Babe. Of course, everyone make a fool of them, but the husband believes Babe's ability. I love pig! Their bottom is cute! I felt interesting that a human and a pig feel their destiny. The combination that a pig and a dog, or a pig and a duck is amusing. The animals get terrified that they are eaten by farmers. Certainly, eating is killing for animals. I got to feel that that action is cruel. Babe is a obedient and good pig, therefore everyone come to love him. His character is wonderful. The husband is also nice because he cheers Babe hard. I could know that how he cherishes his animals. This is a heart warming story. You can have happy feelings.

    This movie is for family and children but it is enough for adults to enjoy watching the movie. One day, a pig is received by a old man as a prize. At first, the man think the pig will for a dinner on Christmas day. The pig is raised by sheepdogs and the old man at a stock farm. The scene is calm. There are many animals with the pig. The pig, named Babe is very clever so I was fascinated with Babe. The old man is kind so he loves the pig gradually. The pig succeed in many things and he get to be trusted by other animals. What I liked in this movie is that all animals can speak fluently like people, it was nice and very interesting. The expressions are just like animals have real feelings. The musics witch are used in the movie are also nice. After watching this movie, I thought each animal has their heats and feeling. Animals also have their society and classes. We should be friendly with animals more even mice. Since I watched this movie at only 5 years old for the first time, I watched this movie many times. If you watch this movie, you must think animals are so lovely. You will also be fascinated with Babe and other animals.

    One day, a farmer won a contest guessing the weight of a pig and he brings the pig to his farm. This film is about the growth of the pig. The pig is called Babe by other animals and he is very cute, honest and moderate, so everyone loves him. I like his smile because his smile makes me warm emotion. As I said, this story describes the growth of Babe. He tries to become like a shepherd dog though he is a pig. I think that this story describes that it is important to pursue dreams even if it seems to be impossible or difficult and also tells us the importance of holding a pure but steady and firm mind for our own dreams. I recommend everyone to watch the film because not only Babe is cute but also this film tells us the very important things in our life.

    Babe is a great movie with a really sweet storyline,a great voice cast as well as an inspired performance by James Cromwell and some very likable and memorable characters.The movie is a great movie for the whole famly,it has enough in it to entertain both younger and older audiences.I certainly don't think that is a Best Picture nominee,although it did definitely deserve the Academy Award Best Visual Effects as the movie is very well made.These talking animal films are usually only fun for children,but Babe has enough in it for the entire family to enjoy and I would highly recommend it as a film for the whole family to watch. Farmer Hoggett (James Cromwell) trains a pig who was taken away from his mother and grew up with sheepdogs,to herd sheep himself.

    Babe was one of the very first films that I watched during childhood, it tells the story about a juvenile pig (The "Babe" of the title.) who is trained to become a sheepdog (Well, a "sheeppig" really.) in order to avoid the slaughter house. Babe encounters some dangerous escapades, so he learns the dangers of life, like any child would if they were entering the real life world. I liked this film; especially its brilliant animatronics, it won for best special effects in 1995, and it really deserved that award. James Cromwell's performance as Farmer Hoggett was also stunning. The music fitted the mood of the film very well, even if the instrumental for "If I had Words" felt very repetitive, it was a great piece of music that the film boosted its heartstrings-pulling potential with. My only drawback was the singing mice who narrated the chapter titles, they made me cringe; but it still didn't stop me from enjoying this wonderful, wonderful movie. I give it an eight. 9/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    - A I am not a favorite of films with the little stories inside a big motion picture, but the stories in this one are so well done that it didn't bother me and made appreciate the film even more. All the animals are lovable with their own personalities. The story is silly, but in a fun, family friendly way of a pig thinking he's a dog and then acts like one throughout with the hilarious ending at the dog show. This was an excellent film that had tough competition for best picture but easily one of the best family films for all ages. Don't judge it as an animal film, it may surprise you.

    An inspiring, wonderful, sad, funny, poetic film which is nothing less than No.4 in my all time list. Pork is my favourite meat, and I almost gave it up over this... until common sense kicked in. There is no more charming and humble hero than the title porker, and with the aid of a bit of blue screen technology which creates the illusion that they can talk, him and his farmyard buddies create a cast that put 99.999999% of human casts to shame with their wit and intelligence. It's just one of those magical movies where everything works... Even James Cromwell's cheesy impromptu dance to help cheer a sick Babe up is a splendid, life-affirming moment. But it doesn't shy away from the darker side either, as the sight of abattoir slaughter and a sheep being ripped apart by dogs remind us that life is not all sunshine and lollypops. I could fill an encyclopedia on all the thing I adore about this lovely, lovely film, but the fact I'm not ending the review with a sarcastic quip should be a good indicator that this truly is, something very special indeed. 10/10

    This is a film that is Art. I held back from seeing it because I hate jumping on bandwagons or going along with the crowd about anything, but I was surprised when I found myself welling up with tears even before the beginning credits completely rolled past. Something was coming that was completely disarming and I could already sense that. A story that could not be confronted behind a social mask or cultural pose of any kind. It went past all the carefully constructed chains of reason and straight for the heart. Before I saw this film, I never understood what people meant by the '- end of childhood innocence -'. After this film, I realized it had something to do with other living beings dying so that you could thrive in your survival. This being an unalterable Fact of Life. It also has to do with slaughterhouses, wringing chickens' necks, cracking eggs open and frying their contents before these fully develop into chicks and pickled pigs feet and bacon. In other words, Life and Death are inextricably bound up in the warp and woof of existence on this planet. 'Babe' is about those precious childhood moments where everything that benefits us seems to be bestowed upon us by the magic of our parents and there is no death. No awareness that ears of corn and cabbages sacrifice themselves for us at the fullest flowering of their development so that we can have popcorn and coleslaw. Set it out that way and you have the angst of adolescence. The realization that even the best intentions and the most wholesome living does not exempt us from facing the vicissitudes that lead to the Grim Reaper eventually paying us a call. It takes the punch out of the joke and the life out of the party. I remember in a film called 'The Misfits' Marilyn Monroe got all upset because Clark Gable was roping Mustangs out on the open plains to be turned into dog food. She would rant and have tantrums about it, but it all seemed so very childish. Like someone or some teacher never sat her down and explained to her about the Food Chain. The point being of course that she was not protesting about the Mustangs at all, but about some universe where Mustangs rope humans and turn them into food for some kind of pets they are harboring. After all, what goes around comes around, doesn't it? She just didn't want to end up someone's favorite recipe in a cookbook somewhere. She was wondering, as children often do without being fully able to articulate it, why we can't all just get along without killing and eating each other? But what if there was a way out of all this killing and eating that's so lip smacking good? 'Babe' lightly and gently explores this question. While holding back the answer that the adults keep to themselves. That bacon will still fry even as Babe lives.

    - A I am not a favorite of films with the little stories inside a big motion picture, but the stories in this one are so well done that it didn't bother me and made appreciate the film even more. All the animals are lovable with their own personalities. The story is silly, but in a fun, family friendly way of a pig thinking he's a dog and then acts like one throughout with the hilarious ending at the dog show. This was an excellent film that had tough competition for best picture but easily one of the best family films for all ages. Don't judge it as an animal film, it may surprise you.

    An inspiring, wonderful, sad, funny, poetic film which is nothing less than No.4 in my all time list. Pork is my favourite meat, and I almost gave it up over this... until common sense kicked in. There is no more charming and humble hero than the title porker, and with the aid of a bit of blue screen technology which creates the illusion that they can talk, him and his farmyard buddies create a cast that put 99.999999% of human casts to shame with their wit and intelligence. It's just one of those magical movies where everything works... Even James Cromwell's cheesy impromptu dance to help cheer a sick Babe up is a splendid, life-affirming moment. But it doesn't shy away from the darker side either, as the sight of abattoir slaughter and a sheep being ripped apart by dogs remind us that life is not all sunshine and lollypops. I could fill an encyclopedia on all the thing I adore about this lovely, lovely film, but the fact I'm not ending the review with a sarcastic quip should be a good indicator that this truly is, something very special indeed. 10/10

    This is a film that is Art. I held back from seeing it because I hate jumping on bandwagons or going along with the crowd about anything, but I was surprised when I found myself welling up with tears even before the beginning credits completely rolled past. Something was coming that was completely disarming and I could already sense that. A story that could not be confronted behind a social mask or cultural pose of any kind. It went past all the carefully constructed chains of reason and straight for the heart. Before I saw this film, I never understood what people meant by the '- end of childhood innocence -'. After this film, I realized it had something to do with other living beings dying so that you could thrive in your survival. This being an unalterable Fact of Life. It also has to do with slaughterhouses, wringing chickens' necks, cracking eggs open and frying their contents before these fully develop into chicks and pickled pigs feet and bacon. In other words, Life and Death are inextricably bound up in the warp and woof of existence on this planet. 'Babe' is about those precious childhood moments where everything that benefits us seems to be bestowed upon us by the magic of our parents and there is no death. No awareness that ears of corn and cabbages sacrifice themselves for us at the fullest flowering of their development so that we can have popcorn and coleslaw. Set it out that way and you have the angst of adolescence. The realization that even the best intentions and the most wholesome living does not exempt us from facing the vicissitudes that lead to the Grim Reaper eventually paying us a call. It takes the punch out of the joke and the life out of the party. I remember in a film called 'The Misfits' Marilyn Monroe got all upset because Clark Gable was roping Mustangs out on the open plains to be turned into dog food. She would rant and have tantrums about it, but it all seemed so very childish. Like someone or some teacher never sat her down and explained to her about the Food Chain. The point being of course that she was not protesting about the Mustangs at all, but about some universe where Mustangs rope humans and turn them into food for some kind of pets they are harboring. After all, what goes around comes around, doesn't it? She just didn't want to end up someone's favorite recipe in a cookbook somewhere. She was wondering, as children often do without being fully able to articulate it, why we can't all just get along without killing and eating each other? But what if there was a way out of all this killing and eating that's so lip smacking good? 'Babe' lightly and gently explores this question. While holding back the answer that the adults keep to themselves. That bacon will still fry even as Babe lives.

    "Babe" resurrects a kind of magic we thought to have disappeared since the glorious age of Walt Disney classics. It's an animal-centered movie but through its inspirational story and endearing sweetness, remains closer to "Bambi" and "Dumbo" than "The Jungle Book" or even "The Lion King". "Babe" is the name of a little pig that grew up in an Australian farm owned by Arthur Hogget (James Cromwell) and dreamed of becoming a sheep dog. But there's a time to get to that dream, and the director Chris Noonan starts by immersing us into the farm, it's in Australia, but as a matter of fact, it can be any farm, as imagined by any child from any place in the world. Farm in "Babe" is not just a beautiful dream-like setting, it happens to be a codified universe where each species has a specific place depending on its utility. The rooster wakes up the farmer, the hens make eggs, cows give milk, dogs herd the sheep, cat chase mice, horses transport etc. In this hierarchy, pigs are in the bottom, their only purpose being to grow up, to get fat so they can be eaten and go to Paradise, a place so beautiful no pig ever came back from. The film deals with pigs' fate with a gravity that mirrors the dramatic death of Bambi's mother, but also through comedy with the unforgettable Ferdinand the Duck who tries to replace the rooster to be spared from being eaten. Babe is an outcast, but like "Dumbo" and in a lesser measure "Pinocchio", in the gentle sense of the word. Indeed, he wants to be useful, to be part of the farm's collective effort. The charm of "Babe" is to create a character to which any kid can identify with; inspired by the idea of following their dreams no matter how silly they sound. But nothing is silly when handled in a smooth and sensitive way. Babe respects the order and the leadership of Rex, the male sheepdog, he plays with Rex and his female Fly's puppies, but they have the right to be in home, along with the cat, but he can't. This feeling of rejection is the cement of kids' personalities because it's a way for children to determine what they can bring to the others. The story goes on, punctuated by the songs of three little mice, with a high-pitched voice that make anything they say irresistible to the ears. The film is an extraordinary achievement as it really focuses on animals' feelings more than their actions. In a sad scene where Rex and Fly's puppies are sold, you could see the sadness in the two parent's eyes, and ironically, Rex, the hard-nosed and grouchy one seemed to be most devastated, we'd learn later than he'd already experience loss. The 'puppies' scene isn't shot in an overly dramatic way because its main purpose is to show that even the sheepdogs must deal with some aspects of their lives they don't necessary like. The second purpose is to build the relationship between Babe and Fly. As a new adoptive mother, Fly believes that Babe can make a good replacement for Rex, who never won a championship since the day he lost sheep during a pouring rain and became almost deaf. The farm owner, Hogget, sees the same potential in Babe and decides to give him a chance. Why? As the narrator says: "These little ideas that tickled and nagged and refused to go away should never be ignored for in them lie the seeds of destiny", that's the kind of movie quotes that takes you by surprise and displays a level of smartness that can appeal to both kids and adults. Also, it starts off the core of the story, which is less the coming-of-age of Babe than the beautiful relationship between the little pig and his master. James Cromwell, was rightfully Oscar-nominated for Best Supporting Actor because this is the kind of role you can't cheat on. It might be easy to pretend to talk to a pig, but there are emotions that cannot be feigned, and the look on Cromwell's eyes in some scenes betrayed a genuine attachment. But again, it's not that easy to make out of a pig, a believable sheep dog. In a key scene, Fly orders Babe to shout at the sheep, to be more aggressive. After all, he's still a pig, his master might change his mind: it's still a life-and-death situation. That was the make it or break it part of the script, had Babe commanded the sheep through violence, the film would have lost me. Naturally, "Babe" respects both the children and the adult's intelligence by not operating a 180&deg; turn on its character. Babe is first mocked but it's by talking to the sheep gently, by explaining what he wants to Maa, the older one, that he gets what he wants. The point is not to teach that being nice might open every door, but that sometimes you get to better results by getting things your way. It's about respecting the others, and not assuming someone's silly or wouldn't understand because he or she's different. The dogs are constantly insulting sheep but a very clever twist reveals at the end, that the sheep doesn't think much of the dogs either, both prejudices being due to some ancestral conditioning. If anything, Babe is a lesson of humility, gentleness and perseverance. The ending can come as predictable but there's more in the film than a simple plot. it's about self-acceptance, respect before inspiring the recognition and the love of people that count in our lives, something powerfully conveyed by the Cromwell's face with his "That'll do, pig. That'll do". And from a man of few words, each one carried the same magical resonance than the moment where Pinocchio became a real boy and Dumbo started flying in the circus.

The life of Babe with many animals in farm starts. I like this movie so much. All animals are so pretty. We can hear that the animals talk. Of course, the human in the movie cannot hear the voice of animals. Babe is kind to everyone, he is really pure and he tackles everything with all his efforts. Therefor I like Babe so much. And I love his friends in farm too. When Babe is in trouble, his friends do them best to help him. That made me happy. This movie tells me the importance of friends. This is a heart-warming film. I recommend you to watch this movie. This story will make you smile and feel happy.

    A pig, Babe, is taken to a farm and is taken care of by the farmers for eating. There, there are various animals which have great originality. The husband comes to like Babe and he tries to take part in sheepdog contest with Babe. Of course, everyone make a fool of them, but the husband believes Babe's ability. I love pig! Their bottom is cute! I felt interesting that a human and a pig feel their destiny. The combination that a pig and a dog, or a pig and a duck is amusing. The animals get terrified that they are eaten by farmers. Certainly, eating is killing for animals. I got to feel that that action is cruel. Babe is a obedient and good pig, therefore everyone come to love him. His character is wonderful. The husband is also nice because he cheers Babe hard. I could know that how he cherishes his animals. This is a heart warming story. You can have happy feelings.

    This movie is for family and children but it is enough for adults to enjoy watching the movie. One day, a pig is received by a old man as a prize. At first, the man think the pig will for a dinner on Christmas day. The pig is raised by sheepdogs and the old man at a stock farm. The scene is calm. There are many animals with the pig. The pig, named Babe is very clever so I was fascinated with Babe. The old man is kind so he loves the pig gradually. The pig succeed in many things and he get to be trusted by other animals. What I liked in this movie is that all animals can speak fluently like people, it was nice and very interesting. The expressions are just like animals have real feelings. The musics witch are used in the movie are also nice. After watching this movie, I thought each animal has their heats and feeling. Animals also have their society and classes. We should be friendly with animals more even mice. Since I watched this movie at only 5 years old for the first time, I watched this movie many times. If you watch this movie, you must think animals are so lovely. You will also be fascinated with Babe and other animals.

    One day, a farmer won a contest guessing the weight of a pig and he brings the pig to his farm. This film is about the growth of the pig. The pig is called Babe by other animals and he is very cute, honest and moderate, so everyone loves him. I like his smile because his smile makes me warm emotion. As I said, this story describes the growth of Babe. He tries to become like a shepherd dog though he is a pig. I think that this story describes that it is important to pursue dreams even if it seems to be impossible or difficult and also tells us the importance of holding a pure but steady and firm mind for our own dreams. I recommend everyone to watch the film because not only Babe is cute but also this film tells us the very important things in our life.

    Babe is a great movie with a really sweet storyline,a great voice cast as well as an inspired performance by James Cromwell and some very likable and memorable characters.The movie is a great movie for the whole famly,it has enough in it to entertain both younger and older audiences.I certainly don't think that is a Best Picture nominee,although it did definitely deserve the Academy Award Best Visual Effects as the movie is very well made.These talking animal films are usually only fun for children,but Babe has enough in it for the entire family to enjoy and I would highly recommend it as a film for the whole family to watch. Farmer Hoggett (James Cromwell) trains a pig who was taken away from his mother and grew up with sheepdogs,to herd sheep himself.

    Babe was one of the very first films that I watched during childhood, it tells the story about a juvenile pig (The "Babe" of the title.) who is trained to become a sheepdog (Well, a "sheeppig" really.) in order to avoid the slaughter house. Babe encounters some dangerous escapades, so he learns the dangers of life, like any child would if they were entering the real life world. I liked this film; especially its brilliant animatronics, it won for best special effects in 1995, and it really deserved that award. James Cromwell's performance as Farmer Hoggett was also stunning. The music fitted the mood of the film very well, even if the instrumental for "If I had Words" felt very repetitive, it was a great piece of music that the film boosted its heartstrings-pulling potential with. My only drawback was the singing mice who narrated the chapter titles, they made me cringe; but it still didn't stop me from enjoying this wonderful, wonderful movie. I give it an eight. 9/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

The musics witch are used in the movie are also nice. After watching this movie, I thought each animal has their heats and feeling. Animals also have their society and classes. We should be friendly with animals more even mice. Since I watched this movie at only 5 years old for the first time, I watched this movie many times. If you watch this movie, you must think animals are so lovely. You will also be fascinated with Babe and other animals.

    One day, a farmer won a contest guessing the weight of a pig and he brings the pig to his farm. This film is about the growth of the pig. The pig is called Babe by other animals and he is very cute, honest and moderate, so everyone loves him. I like his smile because his smile makes me warm emotion. As I said, this story describes the growth of Babe. He tries to become like a shepherd dog though he is a pig. I think that this story describes that it is important to pursue dreams even if it seems to be impossible or difficult and also tells us the importance of holding a pure but steady and firm mind for our own dreams. I recommend everyone to watch the film because not only Babe is cute but also this film tells us the very important things in our life.

    Babe is a great movie with a really sweet storyline,a great voice cast as well as an inspired performance by James Cromwell and some very likable and memorable characters.The movie is a great movie for the whole famly,it has enough in it to entertain both younger and older audiences.I certainly don't think that is a Best Picture nominee,although it did definitely deserve the Academy Award Best Visual Effects as the movie is very well made.These talking animal films are usually only fun for children,but Babe has enough in it for the entire family to enjoy and I would highly recommend it as a film for the whole family to watch. Farmer Hoggett (James Cromwell) trains a pig who was taken away from his mother and grew up with sheepdogs,to herd sheep himself.

    Babe was one of the very first films that I watched during childhood, it tells the story about a juvenile pig (The "Babe" of the title.) who is trained to become a sheepdog (Well, a "sheeppig" really.) in order to avoid the slaughter house. Babe encounters some dangerous escapades, so he learns the dangers of life, like any child would if they were entering the real life world. I liked this film; especially its brilliant animatronics, it won for best special effects in 1995, and it really deserved that award. James Cromwell's performance as Farmer Hoggett was also stunning. The music fitted the mood of the film very well, even if the instrumental for "If I had Words" felt very repetitive, it was a great piece of music that the film boosted its heartstrings-pulling potential with. My only drawback was the singing mice who narrated the chapter titles, they made me cringe; but it still didn't stop me from enjoying this wonderful, wonderful movie. I give it an eight. 9/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    - A I am not a favorite of films with the little stories inside a big motion picture, but the stories in this one are so well done that it didn't bother me and made appreciate the film even more. All the animals are lovable with their own personalities. The story is silly, but in a fun, family friendly way of a pig thinking he's a dog and then acts like one throughout with the hilarious ending at the dog show. This was an excellent film that had tough competition for best picture but easily one of the best family films for all ages. Don't judge it as an animal film, it may surprise you.

    An inspiring, wonderful, sad, funny, poetic film which is nothing less than No.4 in my all time list. Pork is my favourite meat, and I almost gave it up over this... until common sense kicked in. There is no more charming and humble hero than the title porker, and with the aid of a bit of blue screen technology which creates the illusion that they can talk, him and his farmyard buddies create a cast that put 99.999999% of human casts to shame with their wit and intelligence. It's just one of those magical movies where everything works... Even James Cromwell's cheesy impromptu dance to help cheer a sick Babe up is a splendid, life-affirming moment. But it doesn't shy away from the darker side either, as the sight of abattoir slaughter and a sheep being ripped apart by dogs remind us that life is not all sunshine and lollypops. I could fill an encyclopedia on all the thing I adore about this lovely, lovely film, but the fact I'm not ending the review with a sarcastic quip should be a good indicator that this truly is, something very special indeed. 10/10

    This is a film that is Art. I held back from seeing it because I hate jumping on bandwagons or going along with the crowd about anything, but I was surprised when I found myself welling up with tears even before the beginning credits completely rolled past. Something was coming that was completely disarming and I could already sense that. A story that could not be confronted behind a social mask or cultural pose of any kind. It went past all the carefully constructed chains of reason and straight for the heart. Before I saw this film, I never understood what people meant by the '- end of childhood innocence -'. After this film, I realized it had something to do with other living beings dying so that you could thrive in your survival. This being an unalterable Fact of Life. It also has to do with slaughterhouses, wringing chickens' necks, cracking eggs open and frying their contents before these fully develop into chicks and pickled pigs feet and bacon. In other words, Life and Death are inextricably bound up in the warp and woof of existence on this planet. 'Babe' is about those precious childhood moments where everything that benefits us seems to be bestowed upon us by the magic of our parents and there is no death. No awareness that ears of corn and cabbages sacrifice themselves for us at the fullest flowering of their development so that we can have popcorn and coleslaw. Set it out that way and you have the angst of adolescence. The realization that even the best intentions and the most wholesome living does not exempt us from facing the vicissitudes that lead to the Grim Reaper eventually paying us a call. It takes the punch out of the joke and the life out of the party. I remember in a film called 'The Misfits' Marilyn Monroe got all upset because Clark Gable was roping Mustangs out on the open plains to be turned into dog food. She would rant and have tantrums about it, but it all seemed so very childish. Like someone or some teacher never sat her down and explained to her about the Food Chain. The point being of course that she was not protesting about the Mustangs at all, but about some universe where Mustangs rope humans and turn them into food for some kind of pets they are harboring. After all, what goes around comes around, doesn't it? She just didn't want to end up someone's favorite recipe in a cookbook somewhere. She was wondering, as children often do without being fully able to articulate it, why we can't all just get along without killing and eating each other? But what if there was a way out of all this killing and eating that's so lip smacking good? 'Babe' lightly and gently explores this question. While holding back the answer that the adults keep to themselves. That bacon will still fry even as Babe lives.

    "Babe" resurrects a kind of magic we thought to have disappeared since the glorious age of Walt Disney classics. It's an animal-centered movie but through its inspirational story and endearing sweetness, remains closer to "Bambi" and "Dumbo" than "The Jungle Book" or even "The Lion King". "Babe" is the name of a little pig that grew up in an Australian farm owned by Arthur Hogget (James Cromwell) and dreamed of becoming a sheep dog. But there's a time to get to that dream, and the director Chris Noonan starts by immersing us into the farm, it's in Australia, but as a matter of fact, it can be any farm, as imagined by any child from any place in the world. Farm in "Babe" is not just a beautiful dream-like setting, it happens to be a codified universe where each species has a specific place depending on its utility. The rooster wakes up the farmer, the hens make eggs, cows give milk, dogs herd the sheep, cat chase mice, horses transport etc. In this hierarchy, pigs are in the bottom, their only purpose being to grow up, to get fat so they can be eaten and go to Paradise, a place so beautiful no pig ever came back from. The film deals with pigs' fate with a gravity that mirrors the dramatic death of Bambi's mother, but also through comedy with the unforgettable Ferdinand the Duck who tries to replace the rooster to be spared from being eaten. Babe is an outcast, but like "Dumbo" and in a lesser measure "Pinocchio", in the gentle sense of the word. Indeed, he wants to be useful, to be part of the farm's collective effort. The charm of "Babe" is to create a character to which any kid can identify with; inspired by the idea of following their dreams no matter how silly they sound. But nothing is silly when handled in a smooth and sensitive way. Babe respects the order and the leadership of Rex, the male sheepdog, he plays with Rex and his female Fly's puppies, but they have the right to be in home, along with the cat, but he can't. This feeling of rejection is the cement of kids' personalities because it's a way for children to determine what they can bring to the others. The story goes on, punctuated by the songs of three little mice, with a high-pitched voice that make anything they say irresistible to the ears. The film is an extraordinary achievement as it really focuses on animals' feelings more than their actions. In a sad scene where Rex and Fly's puppies are sold, you could see the sadness in the two parent's eyes, and ironically, Rex, the hard-nosed and grouchy one seemed to be most devastated, we'd learn later than he'd already experience loss. The 'puppies' scene isn't shot in an overly dramatic way because its main purpose is to show that even the sheepdogs must deal with some aspects of their lives they don't necessary like. The second purpose is to build the relationship between Babe and Fly. As a new adoptive mother, Fly believes that Babe can make a good replacement for Rex, who never won a championship since the day he lost sheep during a pouring rain and became almost deaf. The farm owner, Hogget, sees the same potential in Babe and decides to give him a chance. Why? As the narrator says: "These little ideas that tickled and nagged and refused to go away should never be ignored for in them lie the seeds of destiny", that's the kind of movie quotes that takes you by surprise and displays a level of smartness that can appeal to both kids and adults. Also, it starts off the core of the story, which is less the coming-of-age of Babe than the beautiful relationship between the little pig and his master. James Cromwell, was rightfully Oscar-nominated for Best Supporting Actor because this is the kind of role you can't cheat on. It might be easy to pretend to talk to a pig, but there are emotions that cannot be feigned, and the look on Cromwell's eyes in some scenes betrayed a genuine attachment. But again, it's not that easy to make out of a pig, a believable sheep dog. In a key scene, Fly orders Babe to shout at the sheep, to be more aggressive. After all, he's still a pig, his master might change his mind: it's still a life-and-death situation. That was the make it or break it part of the script, had Babe commanded the sheep through violence, the film would have lost me. Naturally, "Babe" respects both the children and the adult's intelligence by not operating a 180&deg; turn on its character. Babe is first mocked but it's by talking to the sheep gently, by explaining what he wants to Maa, the older one, that he gets what he wants. The point is not to teach that being nice might open every door, but that sometimes you get to better results by getting things your way. It's about respecting the others, and not assuming someone's silly or wouldn't understand because he or she's different. The dogs are constantly insulting sheep but a very clever twist reveals at the end, that the sheep doesn't think much of the dogs either, both prejudices being due to some ancestral conditioning. If anything, Babe is a lesson of humility, gentleness and perseverance. The ending can come as predictable but there's more in the film than a simple plot. it's about self-acceptance, respect before inspiring the recognition and the love of people that count in our lives, something powerfully conveyed by the Cromwell's face with his "That'll do, pig. That'll do". And from a man of few words, each one carried the same magical resonance than the moment where Pinocchio became a real boy and Dumbo started flying in the circus.

    This is a story of a little pig. His name is Babe. Arthur who is a famer got Babe in Harvest festival and he takes care of him. His farm has so many animals. The life of Babe with many animals in farm starts. I like this movie so much. All animals are so pretty. We can hear that the animals talk. Of course, the human in the movie cannot hear the voice of animals. Babe is kind to everyone, he is really pure and he tackles everything with all his efforts. Therefor I like Babe so much. And I love his friends in farm too. When Babe is in trouble, his friends do them best to help him. That made me happy. This movie tells me the importance of friends. This is a heart-warming film. I recommend you to watch this movie. This story will make you smile and feel happy.

    A pig, Babe, is taken to a farm and is taken care of by the farmers for eating. There, there are various animals which have great originality. The husband comes to like Babe and he tries to take part in sheepdog contest with Babe. Of course, everyone make a fool of them, but the husband believes Babe's ability. I love pig! Their bottom is cute! I felt interesting that a human and a pig feel their destiny. The combination that a pig and a dog, or a pig and a duck is amusing. The animals get terrified that they are eaten by farmers. Certainly, eating is killing for animals. I got to feel that that action is cruel. Babe is a obedient and good pig, therefore everyone come to love him. His character is wonderful. The husband is also nice because he cheers Babe hard. I could know that how he cherishes his animals. This is a heart warming story. You can have happy feelings.

Babe is first mocked but it's by talking to the sheep gently, by explaining what he wants to Maa, the older one, that he gets what he wants. The point is not to teach that being nice might open every door, but that sometimes you get to better results by getting things your way. It's about respecting the others, and not assuming someone's silly or wouldn't understand because he or she's different. The dogs are constantly insulting sheep but a very clever twist reveals at the end, that the sheep doesn't think much of the dogs either, both prejudices being due to some ancestral conditioning. If anything, Babe is a lesson of humility, gentleness and perseverance. The ending can come as predictable but there's more in the film than a simple plot. it's about self-acceptance, respect before inspiring the recognition and the love of people that count in our lives, something powerfully conveyed by the Cromwell's face with his "That'll do, pig. That'll do". And from a man of few words, each one carried the same magical resonance than the moment where Pinocchio became a real boy and Dumbo started flying in the circus.

    This is a story of a little pig. His name is Babe. Arthur who is a famer got Babe in Harvest festival and he takes care of him. His farm has so many animals. The life of Babe with many animals in farm starts. I like this movie so much. All animals are so pretty. We can hear that the animals talk. Of course, the human in the movie cannot hear the voice of animals. Babe is kind to everyone, he is really pure and he tackles everything with all his efforts. Therefor I like Babe so much. And I love his friends in farm too. When Babe is in trouble, his friends do them best to help him. That made me happy. This movie tells me the importance of friends. This is a heart-warming film. I recommend you to watch this movie. This story will make you smile and feel happy.

    A pig, Babe, is taken to a farm and is taken care of by the farmers for eating. There, there are various animals which have great originality. The husband comes to like Babe and he tries to take part in sheepdog contest with Babe. Of course, everyone make a fool of them, but the husband believes Babe's ability. I love pig! Their bottom is cute! I felt interesting that a human and a pig feel their destiny. The combination that a pig and a dog, or a pig and a duck is amusing. The animals get terrified that they are eaten by farmers. Certainly, eating is killing for animals. I got to feel that that action is cruel. Babe is a obedient and good pig, therefore everyone come to love him. His character is wonderful. The husband is also nice because he cheers Babe hard. I could know that how he cherishes his animals. This is a heart warming story. You can have happy feelings.

    This movie is for family and children but it is enough for adults to enjoy watching the movie. One day, a pig is received by a old man as a prize. At first, the man think the pig will for a dinner on Christmas day. The pig is raised by sheepdogs and the old man at a stock farm. The scene is calm. There are many animals with the pig. The pig, named Babe is very clever so I was fascinated with Babe. The old man is kind so he loves the pig gradually. The pig succeed in many things and he get to be trusted by other animals. What I liked in this movie is that all animals can speak fluently like people, it was nice and very interesting. The expressions are just like animals have real feelings. The musics witch are used in the movie are also nice. After watching this movie, I thought each animal has their heats and feeling. Animals also have their society and classes. We should be friendly with animals more even mice. Since I watched this movie at only 5 years old for the first time, I watched this movie many times. If you watch this movie, you must think animals are so lovely. You will also be fascinated with Babe and other animals.

    One day, a farmer won a contest guessing the weight of a pig and he brings the pig to his farm. This film is about the growth of the pig. The pig is called Babe by other animals and he is very cute, honest and moderate, so everyone loves him. I like his smile because his smile makes me warm emotion. As I said, this story describes the growth of Babe. He tries to become like a shepherd dog though he is a pig. I think that this story describes that it is important to pursue dreams even if it seems to be impossible or difficult and also tells us the importance of holding a pure but steady and firm mind for our own dreams. I recommend everyone to watch the film because not only Babe is cute but also this film tells us the very important things in our life.

    Babe is a great movie with a really sweet storyline,a great voice cast as well as an inspired performance by James Cromwell and some very likable and memorable characters.The movie is a great movie for the whole famly,it has enough in it to entertain both younger and older audiences.I certainly don't think that is a Best Picture nominee,although it did definitely deserve the Academy Award Best Visual Effects as the movie is very well made.These talking animal films are usually only fun for children,but Babe has enough in it for the entire family to enjoy and I would highly recommend it as a film for the whole family to watch. Farmer Hoggett (James Cromwell) trains a pig who was taken away from his mother and grew up with sheepdogs,to herd sheep himself.

    Babe was one of the very first films that I watched during childhood, it tells the story about a juvenile pig (The "Babe" of the title.) who is trained to become a sheepdog (Well, a "sheeppig" really.) in order to avoid the slaughter house. Babe encounters some dangerous escapades, so he learns the dangers of life, like any child would if they were entering the real life world. I liked this film; especially its brilliant animatronics, it won for best special effects in 1995, and it really deserved that award. James Cromwell's performance as Farmer Hoggett was also stunning. The music fitted the mood of the film very well, even if the instrumental for "If I had Words" felt very repetitive, it was a great piece of music that the film boosted its heartstrings-pulling potential with. My only drawback was the singing mice who narrated the chapter titles, they made me cringe; but it still didn't stop me from enjoying this wonderful, wonderful movie. I give it an eight. 9/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    - A I am not a favorite of films with the little stories inside a big motion picture, but the stories in this one are so well done that it didn't bother me and made appreciate the film even more. All the animals are lovable with their own personalities. The story is silly, but in a fun, family friendly way of a pig thinking he's a dog and then acts like one throughout with the hilarious ending at the dog show. This was an excellent film that had tough competition for best picture but easily one of the best family films for all ages. Don't judge it as an animal film, it may surprise you.

    An inspiring, wonderful, sad, funny, poetic film which is nothing less than No.4 in my all time list. Pork is my favourite meat, and I almost gave it up over this... until common sense kicked in. There is no more charming and humble hero than the title porker, and with the aid of a bit of blue screen technology which creates the illusion that they can talk, him and his farmyard buddies create a cast that put 99.999999% of human casts to shame with their wit and intelligence. It's just one of those magical movies where everything works... Even James Cromwell's cheesy impromptu dance to help cheer a sick Babe up is a splendid, life-affirming moment. But it doesn't shy away from the darker side either, as the sight of abattoir slaughter and a sheep being ripped apart by dogs remind us that life is not all sunshine and lollypops. I could fill an encyclopedia on all the thing I adore about this lovely, lovely film, but the fact I'm not ending the review with a sarcastic quip should be a good indicator that this truly is, something very special indeed. 10/10

    This is a film that is Art. I held back from seeing it because I hate jumping on bandwagons or going along with the crowd about anything, but I was surprised when I found myself welling up with tears even before the beginning credits completely rolled past. Something was coming that was completely disarming and I could already sense that. A story that could not be confronted behind a social mask or cultural pose of any kind. It went past all the carefully constructed chains of reason and straight for the heart. Before I saw this film, I never understood what people meant by the '- end of childhood innocence -'. After this film, I realized it had something to do with other living beings dying so that you could thrive in your survival. This being an unalterable Fact of Life. It also has to do with slaughterhouses, wringing chickens' necks, cracking eggs open and frying their contents before these fully develop into chicks and pickled pigs feet and bacon. In other words, Life and Death are inextricably bound up in the warp and woof of existence on this planet. 'Babe' is about those precious childhood moments where everything that benefits us seems to be bestowed upon us by the magic of our parents and there is no death. No awareness that ears of corn and cabbages sacrifice themselves for us at the fullest flowering of their development so that we can have popcorn and coleslaw. Set it out that way and you have the angst of adolescence. The realization that even the best intentions and the most wholesome living does not exempt us from facing the vicissitudes that lead to the Grim Reaper eventually paying us a call. It takes the punch out of the joke and the life out of the party. I remember in a film called 'The Misfits' Marilyn Monroe got all upset because Clark Gable was roping Mustangs out on the open plains to be turned into dog food. She would rant and have tantrums about it, but it all seemed so very childish. Like someone or some teacher never sat her down and explained to her about the Food Chain. The point being of course that she was not protesting about the Mustangs at all, but about some universe where Mustangs rope humans and turn them into food for some kind of pets they are harboring. After all, what goes around comes around, doesn't it? She just didn't want to end up someone's favorite recipe in a cookbook somewhere. She was wondering, as children often do without being fully able to articulate it, why we can't all just get along without killing and eating each other? But what if there was a way out of all this killing and eating that's so lip smacking good? 'Babe' lightly and gently explores this question. While holding back the answer that the adults keep to themselves. That bacon will still fry even as Babe lives.

    "Babe" resurrects a kind of magic we thought to have disappeared since the glorious age of Walt Disney classics. It's an animal-centered movie but through its inspirational story and endearing sweetness, remains closer to "Bambi" and "Dumbo" than "The Jungle Book" or even "The Lion King". "Babe" is the name of a little pig that grew up in an Australian farm owned by Arthur Hogget (James Cromwell) and dreamed of becoming a sheep dog. But there's a time to get to that dream, and the director Chris Noonan starts by immersing us into the farm, it's in Australia, but as a matter of fact, it can be any farm, as imagined by any child from any place in the world. Farm in "Babe" is not just a beautiful dream-like setting, it happens to be a codified universe where each species has a specific place depending on its utility. The rooster wakes up the farmer, the hens make eggs, cows give milk, dogs herd the sheep, cat chase mice, horses transport etc. In this hierarchy, pigs are in the bottom, their only purpose being to grow up, to get fat so they can be eaten and go to Paradise, a place so beautiful no pig ever came back from. The film deals with pigs' fate with a gravity that mirrors the dramatic death of Bambi's mother, but also through comedy with the unforgettable Ferdinand the Duck who tries to replace the rooster to be spared from being eaten. Babe is an outcast, but like "Dumbo" and in a lesser measure "Pinocchio", in the gentle sense of the word. Indeed, he wants to be useful, to be part of the farm's collective effort. The charm of "Babe" is to create a character to which any kid can identify with; inspired by the idea of following their dreams no matter how silly they sound. But nothing is silly when handled in a smooth and sensitive way. Babe respects the order and the leadership of Rex, the male sheepdog, he plays with Rex and his female Fly's puppies, but they have the right to be in home, along with the cat, but he can't. This feeling of rejection is the cement of kids' personalities because it's a way for children to determine what they can bring to the others. The story goes on, punctuated by the songs of three little mice, with a high-pitched voice that make anything they say irresistible to the ears. The film is an extraordinary achievement as it really focuses on animals' feelings more than their actions. In a sad scene where Rex and Fly's puppies are sold, you could see the sadness in the two parent's eyes, and ironically, Rex, the hard-nosed and grouchy one seemed to be most devastated, we'd learn later than he'd already experience loss. The 'puppies' scene isn't shot in an overly dramatic way because its main purpose is to show that even the sheepdogs must deal with some aspects of their lives they don't necessary like. The second purpose is to build the relationship between Babe and Fly. As a new adoptive mother, Fly believes that Babe can make a good replacement for Rex, who never won a championship since the day he lost sheep during a pouring rain and became almost deaf. The farm owner, Hogget, sees the same potential in Babe and decides to give him a chance. Why? As the narrator says: "These little ideas that tickled and nagged and refused to go away should never be ignored for in them lie the seeds of destiny", that's the kind of movie quotes that takes you by surprise and displays a level of smartness that can appeal to both kids and adults. Also, it starts off the core of the story, which is less the coming-of-age of Babe than the beautiful relationship between the little pig and his master. James Cromwell, was rightfully Oscar-nominated for Best Supporting Actor because this is the kind of role you can't cheat on. It might be easy to pretend to talk to a pig, but there are emotions that cannot be feigned, and the look on Cromwell's eyes in some scenes betrayed a genuine attachment. But again, it's not that easy to make out of a pig, a believable sheep dog. In a key scene, Fly orders Babe to shout at the sheep, to be more aggressive. After all, he's still a pig, his master might change his mind: it's still a life-and-death situation. That was the make it or break it part of the script, had Babe commanded the sheep through violence, the film would have lost me. Naturally, "Babe" respects both the children and the adult's intelligence by not operating a 180&deg; turn on its character. Babe is first mocked but it's by talking to the sheep gently, by explaining what he wants to Maa, the older one, that he gets what he wants. The point is not to teach that being nice might open every door, but that sometimes you get to better results by getting things your way. It's about respecting the others, and not assuming someone's silly or wouldn't understand because he or she's different. The dogs are constantly insulting sheep but a very clever twist reveals at the end, that the sheep doesn't think much of the dogs either, both prejudices being due to some ancestral conditioning. If anything, Babe is a lesson of humility, gentleness and perseverance. The ending can come as predictable but there's more in the film than a simple plot. it's about self-acceptance, respect before inspiring the recognition and the love of people that count in our lives, something powerfully conveyed by the Cromwell's face with his "That'll do, pig. That'll do". And from a man of few words, each one carried the same magical resonance than the moment where Pinocchio became a real boy and Dumbo started flying in the circus.

    "Babe" resurrects a kind of magic we thought to have disappeared since the glorious age of Walt Disney classics. It's an animal-centered movie but through its inspirational story and endearing sweetness, remains closer to "Bambi" and "Dumbo" than "The Jungle Book" or even "The Lion King". "Babe" is the name of a little pig that grew up in an Australian farm owned by Arthur Hogget (James Cromwell) and dreamed of becoming a sheep dog. But there's a time to get to that dream, and the director Chris Noonan starts by immersing us into the farm, it's in Australia, but as a matter of fact, it can be any farm, as imagined by any child from any place in the world. Farm in "Babe" is not just a beautiful dream-like setting, it happens to be a codified universe where each species has a specific place depending on its utility. The rooster wakes up the farmer, the hens make eggs, cows give milk, dogs herd the sheep, cat chase mice, horses transport etc. In this hierarchy, pigs are in the bottom, their only purpose being to grow up, to get fat so they can be eaten and go to Paradise, a place so beautiful no pig ever came back from. The film deals with pigs' fate with a gravity that mirrors the dramatic death of Bambi's mother, but also through comedy with the unforgettable Ferdinand the Duck who tries to replace the rooster to be spared from being eaten. Babe is an outcast, but like "Dumbo" and in a lesser measure "Pinocchio", in the gentle sense of the word. Indeed, he wants to be useful, to be part of the farm's collective effort. The charm of "Babe" is to create a character to which any kid can identify with; inspired by the idea of following their dreams no matter how silly they sound. But nothing is silly when handled in a smooth and sensitive way. Babe respects the order and the leadership of Rex, the male sheepdog, he plays with Rex and his female Fly's puppies, but they have the right to be in home, along with the cat, but he can't. This feeling of rejection is the cement of kids' personalities because it's a way for children to determine what they can bring to the others. The story goes on, punctuated by the songs of three little mice, with a high-pitched voice that make anything they say irresistible to the ears. The film is an extraordinary achievement as it really focuses on animals' feelings more than their actions. In a sad scene where Rex and Fly's puppies are sold, you could see the sadness in the two parent's eyes, and ironically, Rex, the hard-nosed and grouchy one seemed to be most devastated, we'd learn later than he'd already experience loss. The 'puppies' scene isn't shot in an overly dramatic way because its main purpose is to show that even the sheepdogs must deal with some aspects of their lives they don't necessary like. The second purpose is to build the relationship between Babe and Fly. As a new adoptive mother, Fly believes that Babe can make a good replacement for Rex, who never won a championship since the day he lost sheep during a pouring rain and became almost deaf. The farm owner, Hogget, sees the same potential in Babe and decides to give him a chance. Why? As the narrator says: "These little ideas that tickled and nagged and refused to go away should never be ignored for in them lie the seeds of destiny", that's the kind of movie quotes that takes you by surprise and displays a level of smartness that can appeal to both kids and adults. Also, it starts off the core of the story, which is less the coming-of-age of Babe than the beautiful relationship between the little pig and his master. James Cromwell, was rightfully Oscar-nominated for Best Supporting Actor because this is the kind of role you can't cheat on. It might be easy to pretend to talk to a pig, but there are emotions that cannot be feigned, and the look on Cromwell's eyes in some scenes betrayed a genuine attachment. But again, it's not that easy to make out of a pig, a believable sheep dog. In a key scene, Fly orders Babe to shout at the sheep, to be more aggressive. After all, he's still a pig, his master might change his mind: it's still a life-and-death situation. That was the make it or break it part of the script, had Babe commanded the sheep through violence, the film would have lost me. Naturally, "Babe" respects both the children and the adult's intelligence by not operating a 180&deg; turn on its character. Babe is first mocked but it's by talking to the sheep gently, by explaining what he wants to Maa, the older one, that he gets what he wants. The point is not to teach that being nice might open every door, but that sometimes you get to better results by getting things your way. It's about respecting the others, and not assuming someone's silly or wouldn't understand because he or she's different. The dogs are constantly insulting sheep but a very clever twist reveals at the end, that the sheep doesn't think much of the dogs either, both prejudices being due to some ancestral conditioning. If anything, Babe is a lesson of humility, gentleness and perseverance. The ending can come as predictable but there's more in the film than a simple plot. it's about self-acceptance, respect before inspiring the recognition and the love of people that count in our lives, something powerfully conveyed by the Cromwell's face with his "That'll do, pig. That'll do". And from a man of few words, each one carried the same magical resonance than the moment where Pinocchio became a real boy and Dumbo started flying in the circus.

The life of Babe with many animals in farm starts. I like this movie so much. All animals are so pretty. We can hear that the animals talk. Of course, the human in the movie cannot hear the voice of animals. Babe is kind to everyone, he is really pure and he tackles everything with all his efforts. Therefor I like Babe so much. And I love his friends in farm too. When Babe is in trouble, his friends do them best to help him. That made me happy. This movie tells me the importance of friends. This is a heart-warming film. I recommend you to watch this movie. This story will make you smile and feel happy.

    A pig, Babe, is taken to a farm and is taken care of by the farmers for eating. There, there are various animals which have great originality. The husband comes to like Babe and he tries to take part in sheepdog contest with Babe. Of course, everyone make a fool of them, but the husband believes Babe's ability. I love pig! Their bottom is cute! I felt interesting that a human and a pig feel their destiny. The combination that a pig and a dog, or a pig and a duck is amusing. The animals get terrified that they are eaten by farmers. Certainly, eating is killing for animals. I got to feel that that action is cruel. Babe is a obedient and good pig, therefore everyone come to love him. His character is wonderful. The husband is also nice because he cheers Babe hard. I could know that how he cherishes his animals. This is a heart warming story. You can have happy feelings.

    This movie is for family and children but it is enough for adults to enjoy watching the movie. One day, a pig is received by a old man as a prize. At first, the man think the pig will for a dinner on Christmas day. The pig is raised by sheepdogs and the old man at a stock farm. The scene is calm. There are many animals with the pig. The pig, named Babe is very clever so I was fascinated with Babe. The old man is kind so he loves the pig gradually. The pig succeed in many things and he get to be trusted by other animals. What I liked in this movie is that all animals can speak fluently like people, it was nice and very interesting. The expressions are just like animals have real feelings. The musics witch are used in the movie are also nice. After watching this movie, I thought each animal has their heats and feeling. Animals also have their society and classes. We should be friendly with animals more even mice. Since I watched this movie at only 5 years old for the first time, I watched this movie many times. If you watch this movie, you must think animals are so lovely. You will also be fascinated with Babe and other animals.

    One day, a farmer won a contest guessing the weight of a pig and he brings the pig to his farm. This film is about the growth of the pig. The pig is called Babe by other animals and he is very cute, honest and moderate, so everyone loves him. I like his smile because his smile makes me warm emotion. As I said, this story describes the growth of Babe. He tries to become like a shepherd dog though he is a pig. I think that this story describes that it is important to pursue dreams even if it seems to be impossible or difficult and also tells us the importance of holding a pure but steady and firm mind for our own dreams. I recommend everyone to watch the film because not only Babe is cute but also this film tells us the very important things in our life.

    Babe is a great movie with a really sweet storyline,a great voice cast as well as an inspired performance by James Cromwell and some very likable and memorable characters.The movie is a great movie for the whole famly,it has enough in it to entertain both younger and older audiences.I certainly don't think that is a Best Picture nominee,although it did definitely deserve the Academy Award Best Visual Effects as the movie is very well made.These talking animal films are usually only fun for children,but Babe has enough in it for the entire family to enjoy and I would highly recommend it as a film for the whole family to watch. Farmer Hoggett (James Cromwell) trains a pig who was taken away from his mother and grew up with sheepdogs,to herd sheep himself.

    Babe was one of the very first films that I watched during childhood, it tells the story about a juvenile pig (The "Babe" of the title.) who is trained to become a sheepdog (Well, a "sheeppig" really.) in order to avoid the slaughter house. Babe encounters some dangerous escapades, so he learns the dangers of life, like any child would if they were entering the real life world. I liked this film; especially its brilliant animatronics, it won for best special effects in 1995, and it really deserved that award. James Cromwell's performance as Farmer Hoggett was also stunning. The music fitted the mood of the film very well, even if the instrumental for "If I had Words" felt very repetitive, it was a great piece of music that the film boosted its heartstrings-pulling potential with. My only drawback was the singing mice who narrated the chapter titles, they made me cringe; but it still didn't stop me from enjoying this wonderful, wonderful movie. I give it an eight. 9/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    - A I am not a favorite of films with the little stories inside a big motion picture, but the stories in this one are so well done that it didn't bother me and made appreciate the film even more. All the animals are lovable with their own personalities. The story is silly, but in a fun, family friendly way of a pig thinking he's a dog and then acts like one throughout with the hilarious ending at the dog show. This was an excellent film that had tough competition for best picture but easily one of the best family films for all ages. Don't judge it as an animal film, it may surprise you.

    An inspiring, wonderful, sad, funny, poetic film which is nothing less than No.4 in my all time list. Pork is my favourite meat, and I almost gave it up over this... until common sense kicked in. There is no more charming and humble hero than the title porker, and with the aid of a bit of blue screen technology which creates the illusion that they can talk, him and his farmyard buddies create a cast that put 99.999999% of human casts to shame with their wit and intelligence. It's just one of those magical movies where everything works... Even James Cromwell's cheesy impromptu dance to help cheer a sick Babe up is a splendid, life-affirming moment. But it doesn't shy away from the darker side either, as the sight of abattoir slaughter and a sheep being ripped apart by dogs remind us that life is not all sunshine and lollypops. I could fill an encyclopedia on all the thing I adore about this lovely, lovely film, but the fact I'm not ending the review with a sarcastic quip should be a good indicator that this truly is, something very special indeed. 10/10

    This is a film that is Art. I held back from seeing it because I hate jumping on bandwagons or going along with the crowd about anything, but I was surprised when I found myself welling up with tears even before the beginning credits completely rolled past. Something was coming that was completely disarming and I could already sense that. A story that could not be confronted behind a social mask or cultural pose of any kind. It went past all the carefully constructed chains of reason and straight for the heart. Before I saw this film, I never understood what people meant by the '- end of childhood innocence -'. After this film, I realized it had something to do with other living beings dying so that you could thrive in your survival. This being an unalterable Fact of Life. It also has to do with slaughterhouses, wringing chickens' necks, cracking eggs open and frying their contents before these fully develop into chicks and pickled pigs feet and bacon. In other words, Life and Death are inextricably bound up in the warp and woof of existence on this planet. 'Babe' is about those precious childhood moments where everything that benefits us seems to be bestowed upon us by the magic of our parents and there is no death. No awareness that ears of corn and cabbages sacrifice themselves for us at the fullest flowering of their development so that we can have popcorn and coleslaw. Set it out that way and you have the angst of adolescence. The realization that even the best intentions and the most wholesome living does not exempt us from facing the vicissitudes that lead to the Grim Reaper eventually paying us a call. It takes the punch out of the joke and the life out of the party. I remember in a film called 'The Misfits' Marilyn Monroe got all upset because Clark Gable was roping Mustangs out on the open plains to be turned into dog food. She would rant and have tantrums about it, but it all seemed so very childish. Like someone or some teacher never sat her down and explained to her about the Food Chain. The point being of course that she was not protesting about the Mustangs at all, but about some universe where Mustangs rope humans and turn them into food for some kind of pets they are harboring. After all, what goes around comes around, doesn't it? She just didn't want to end up someone's favorite recipe in a cookbook somewhere. She was wondering, as children often do without being fully able to articulate it, why we can't all just get along without killing and eating each other? But what if there was a way out of all this killing and eating that's so lip smacking good? 'Babe' lightly and gently explores this question. While holding back the answer that the adults keep to themselves. That bacon will still fry even as Babe lives.
