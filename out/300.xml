 <sinopse>
  Hijackers seize the plane carrying the President of the United States and his family, but he (an ex-soldier) works from hiding to defeat them.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  The President of the USA goes to Moscow and gives a stirring speech outlining the USA's new "Zero-tolerance" policy with respect to terrorism. On the flight home, terrorists take over Air Force One (the President's official plane) and take the passengers (including his wife and daughter) hostage. The terrorists plan to execute one hostage every half-hour unless/until their demands are met. However, the President is a former Medal of Honor winner, so the terrorists may be in for a surprise...

    President James Marshall (Harrison Ford) is a no non-sense leader who just gave a zero tolerance on terrorism speech. Ironically, terrorists hijackers take over Air Force One. Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman) the leader of the terrorists is a Russian nationalist looking to free General Radek (J&uuml;rgen Prochnow) and replace the Russian government. Wolfgang Petersen directs this action movie. Forget about any realism problems, this is strictly a popcorn movie. There is no need to turn on your brain. Harrison Ford is a credible president, and more importantly, he is a credible action hero. The vice president (Glenn Close) is running things from the White House. There is just too much talking, negotiating, and too much international politics seriousness. At over 2 hours, there are too many slow parts. And the ending has way too many climaxes. They should think about who needs to be killed last. They should kill the big bad last because that should be the one big climax.

    Air Force One. This was the first ever action film that I ever saw as a kid, and I have loved it ever since. It was the film that introduced me to two of my all time favorite actors, Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman, and introduced me to a kick-ass quality of movies which I compared to this. The story entails a band of Russian terrorists, led by the always brilliant and cunning Gary Oldman, sneaking aboard Air Force One, the president of the United State's personal aircraft. The president, played expertly by Harrison Ford, stays aboard to do combat with the terrorist in the bowels (baggage deck) of the airplane. It is kind of just "Die Hard on Air Force One" but I still think its good. I have to mention that this movie is directed by Wolfgang Petersen, the same man who gave us Das Boot, one of the greatest films ever made. He knows how to direct his actors with dignity and make them seem very real given these circumstances (except Poseidon that was a bad movie) The action scenes are very convincing, especially the mid-air rescue at the end of the movie, as well as the hand to hand combat that Ford engages in. The performances are absolutely phenomenal in this film. Harrison Ford gives us a President who goes with his gut on the new policy he gives at the beginning of the movie, and who will never leave his family to die, unlike everyone else who would bolt. Then there is Gary Oldman. Good God is this guy brilliant. His character Ivan is one of the best villains ever put to movies. He's a patriot, he's mean, he's tender about his past, he's imposing, and he is just menacing. Oldman is one of the best actors ever and when you put him with Harrison Ford, the chemistry between hero and villain is out of this world. Glenn Close rounds out as the iron willed Vice President who will still believe in the president even while the others aren't so sure given the predicament. Like Mary Poppins, this film introduced me to the great world of cinema and inspired me to become a filmmaker at a young age. There have been others as I have grown up, but this and the other movie I just mentioned are the two that got me rolling. A movie with good pacing, zippy action, and phenomenal acting, this is one of the best.

The terrorists plan to execute one hostage every half-hour until their demands are met. However, the President is Harrison Ford, a former Medal of Honour winner..... How can anyone hate this movie, if you suspend your disbelief for two hours and try to ignore the blatant patriotism? Its Die Hard on a plane (again), but with Harrison Ford as The President of The USA. The pitch must have been amazing. Its a no brainier. I cannot think of anyone better for the role, and the casting of Oldman is genius, because at the time, thanks to Leon, The Fifth Element, and True Romance, he was the go to guy for playing the villain, plus he's British, and we all know that Brits are the best Bad Guys (according to Hollywood). Yes it's a silly film, and the script is cringeworthy (get off my plane is worthy of Schwarzennegar), but the action is solid, Ford will never be better, and Oldman is brilliant, even thought there is one line he spouts in a cockney accent. And for a two hour movie, it goes at a hectic pace, even when we go through the old round the table stuff with the VP and Dean Stockwell looking serious, like you do in all these types of movies. Turn off your brains for a couple of hours, and you will be in for a treat...

    Quick recap: Well without revealing it for everyone, lets just say the President is so bad-ass he saves the day, single-handedly killing all the bad guys a la Rambo (but with bare hands), then making love to all the women on board, before going on to land the plane blindfolded & gagged on an airstrip the size of a Brazilian, (no-one gets hurt) all the while jingoistic music is playing in the score and all the cast are chanting "USA, USA, USA". I can't remember who, where, how or indeed why this was recommended to me but whoever it was (i assume you know who you are) should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves, as should Ford, Oldman, Close & Macy. I hope the green was worth it.

    I love the film. Great idea from the writers and wise casting decision. Harrison Ford plays a good role here in addition to his previous roles like Han Solo, Indiana Jones, Dr. Richard Kimble and Jack Ryan, etc. During one of my surfing time in the net, I've found out that the Jack Ryan character became president of the United States so I've watched Air Force One again. How I wished the writers of this film collaborated with Tom Clancy to use the Jack Ryan character for their film. The film was already great, it would become super great if Jack Ryan was the main character but just like what I've said earlier great idea from the writers of this film. Another possibility for this film is a sequel. I've just watched White House Down last week. What a great film also. I've thought to use the characters from Air Force One particularly President James Marshall in that film. It would have been a great team up. Channing Tatum and Harrison Ford. Jaime Foxx also portrayed a good president there. For the conclusion, Air Force One is a good film. Worthy of preservation and accolades. I should have been a writer long ago. Air Force One starring Harrison Ford as President James Marshall (President Jack Ryan) Air Force One part two (White House Down) Opening lines for the trailer: First his plane was hijacked, now near the end of his presidency, his house has been trespassed. But this time he is not alone..... Harrison Ford as President James Marshall (President Jack Ryan) and Channing Tatum in a sequel to Air Force One White House Down

    Taking time out from being a statue in the park, Harry Ford is The President. Some dudes hijack his plane and chaos ensues. Mostly a Star Wars special effects convention with video game animation of the Air Force One 747 doing everything in the air except make coffee. The film doesn't fail to maintain a high level of excitement, but it simply goes on too long. By the time Ford takes control of the plane, I'm ready to see him land the damn thing so I can get up and go to the bathroom, but the gunfire and the melodramatics and the time I'm spending looking at the clock increases. Ford is his wooden self and Dean Stockwell looks and acts like Maxwell Smart, but the dependable Glenn Close delivers an intense performance as the Vice President. Out of a possible '10', I give this film 3 pieces of cheese.

    just loved this movie,, first off ain't Gary Oldman the perfect bad azz for this movie,, Harrisson Ford delivers the knockout punch as the president,, and Glen Close as the VP,, very good touch, the president is left with a choice, either release a very bad man from a foreign prison or lose life on Air Force Once,, I don't imagine Obama would be fighting terrorists on a plane.. oops I voted for him,, o well.. so you have someone playing for the other side, and for awhile it's a guessing game as to who that might be,, I loved all the action in this movie,, you had gun play, fist fights,, explosions, a little bit of mystery thrown your way,, all in all I cant' find that much wrong with the movie at all and if I do it escapes me at the moment,, in a way you kinda root for our Russian cold war villain ,, kinda felt sorry for him in a way.. thought this was a great Harisson Ford movie,, way to go.

    I turned this movie off after the first five minutes. I can't stand the liberal elites in Hollywood who blast viewers with their political talking points within the first few minutes of what is suppose to be a thrilling action film. To further describe my outrage, the filmmakers have Harrison Ford's president character denounce the US for its failure to intervene in countries undergoing humanitarian crises. It's as if the benevolent elites in Hollywood want Americans who don't want to police the world and solve every single domestic problem facing less fortunate and successful countries to feel guilty about wanting the US to mind its own business and demand that American political authorities work for the interest of those who pay the damn bills in the first place. The filmmakers could've at least waited until the end of the film to sermonize viewers with their liberal propaganda.

    Tried again to watch this dross again on the TV last night. Failed again. I stood twenty minutes this time, until the bullshit meter went off the clock. The ridiculous SEAL team battle at the beginning where the baddies were all bad shots was laughable. Then the assault on the 747 with rifles firing on full auto was utterly ridiculous. It would have taken only one of these rounds to have punctured the pressure hull, yet none did. Why did some rooms on the plane seem to be huge offices on dry land and nothing like plane compartments ? To get past the obvious security checks simply have a platoons worth of M16s already on the plane for them to use. Surely a dumb move by the Secret Service, an even dumber move by the scriptwriters. Why did Ford and Oldman waste their time on this? Had a big bill just come in from the IRS ?

    OBS spoilers. The movie start of very good, some terrorist hijacks the airplane and takes hostages... Harrison Ford is hiding himself somewhere in the airplanes bottom... and then he kick some of the terrorists asses...,so far the movie is very good and very exiting. BUT in the last 20 minutes to movie just freaks out get VERY ridiculous, and that destroyed the hole movies. Everything was Very great except the last 20 minutes. But overall this is a really good movie that you should watch and the casting is very good also. Well the only bad thing with this movies is the last 20 minutes and the CGI is not very good it looks like some crappy video game especially when it crashes to the water at the end of movie.

It was the film that introduced me to two of my all time favorite actors, Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman, and introduced me to a kick-ass quality of movies which I compared to this. The story entails a band of Russian terrorists, led by the always brilliant and cunning Gary Oldman, sneaking aboard Air Force One, the president of the United State's personal aircraft. The president, played expertly by Harrison Ford, stays aboard to do combat with the terrorist in the bowels (baggage deck) of the airplane. It is kind of just "Die Hard on Air Force One" but I still think its good. I have to mention that this movie is directed by Wolfgang Petersen, the same man who gave us Das Boot, one of the greatest films ever made. He knows how to direct his actors with dignity and make them seem very real given these circumstances (except Poseidon that was a bad movie) The action scenes are very convincing, especially the mid-air rescue at the end of the movie, as well as the hand to hand combat that Ford engages in. The performances are absolutely phenomenal in this film. Harrison Ford gives us a President who goes with his gut on the new policy he gives at the beginning of the movie, and who will never leave his family to die, unlike everyone else who would bolt. Then there is Gary Oldman. Good God is this guy brilliant. His character Ivan is one of the best villains ever put to movies. He's a patriot, he's mean, he's tender about his past, he's imposing, and he is just menacing. Oldman is one of the best actors ever and when you put him with Harrison Ford, the chemistry between hero and villain is out of this world. Glenn Close rounds out as the iron willed Vice President who will still believe in the president even while the others aren't so sure given the predicament. Like Mary Poppins, this film introduced me to the great world of cinema and inspired me to become a filmmaker at a young age. There have been others as I have grown up, but this and the other movie I just mentioned are the two that got me rolling. A movie with good pacing, zippy action, and phenomenal acting, this is one of the best.

    The President goes to Moscow and gives a speech outlining the USA's new "Zero- tolerance" policy with respect to terrorism. On the flight home, terrorists take over Air Force One, and take the passengers, including his wife and daughter, hostage. The terrorists plan to execute one hostage every half-hour until their demands are met. However, the President is Harrison Ford, a former Medal of Honour winner..... How can anyone hate this movie, if you suspend your disbelief for two hours and try to ignore the blatant patriotism? Its Die Hard on a plane (again), but with Harrison Ford as The President of The USA. The pitch must have been amazing. Its a no brainier. I cannot think of anyone better for the role, and the casting of Oldman is genius, because at the time, thanks to Leon, The Fifth Element, and True Romance, he was the go to guy for playing the villain, plus he's British, and we all know that Brits are the best Bad Guys (according to Hollywood). Yes it's a silly film, and the script is cringeworthy (get off my plane is worthy of Schwarzennegar), but the action is solid, Ford will never be better, and Oldman is brilliant, even thought there is one line he spouts in a cockney accent. And for a two hour movie, it goes at a hectic pace, even when we go through the old round the table stuff with the VP and Dean Stockwell looking serious, like you do in all these types of movies. Turn off your brains for a couple of hours, and you will be in for a treat...

    Quick recap: Well without revealing it for everyone, lets just say the President is so bad-ass he saves the day, single-handedly killing all the bad guys a la Rambo (but with bare hands), then making love to all the women on board, before going on to land the plane blindfolded & gagged on an airstrip the size of a Brazilian, (no-one gets hurt) all the while jingoistic music is playing in the score and all the cast are chanting "USA, USA, USA". I can't remember who, where, how or indeed why this was recommended to me but whoever it was (i assume you know who you are) should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves, as should Ford, Oldman, Close & Macy. I hope the green was worth it.

    I love the film. Great idea from the writers and wise casting decision. Harrison Ford plays a good role here in addition to his previous roles like Han Solo, Indiana Jones, Dr. Richard Kimble and Jack Ryan, etc. During one of my surfing time in the net, I've found out that the Jack Ryan character became president of the United States so I've watched Air Force One again. How I wished the writers of this film collaborated with Tom Clancy to use the Jack Ryan character for their film. The film was already great, it would become super great if Jack Ryan was the main character but just like what I've said earlier great idea from the writers of this film. Another possibility for this film is a sequel. I've just watched White House Down last week. What a great film also. I've thought to use the characters from Air Force One particularly President James Marshall in that film. It would have been a great team up. Channing Tatum and Harrison Ford. Jaime Foxx also portrayed a good president there. For the conclusion, Air Force One is a good film. Worthy of preservation and accolades. I should have been a writer long ago. Air Force One starring Harrison Ford as President James Marshall (President Jack Ryan) Air Force One part two (White House Down) Opening lines for the trailer: First his plane was hijacked, now near the end of his presidency, his house has been trespassed. But this time he is not alone..... Harrison Ford as President James Marshall (President Jack Ryan) and Channing Tatum in a sequel to Air Force One White House Down

    Taking time out from being a statue in the park, Harry Ford is The President. Some dudes hijack his plane and chaos ensues. Mostly a Star Wars special effects convention with video game animation of the Air Force One 747 doing everything in the air except make coffee. The film doesn't fail to maintain a high level of excitement, but it simply goes on too long. By the time Ford takes control of the plane, I'm ready to see him land the damn thing so I can get up and go to the bathroom, but the gunfire and the melodramatics and the time I'm spending looking at the clock increases. Ford is his wooden self and Dean Stockwell looks and acts like Maxwell Smart, but the dependable Glenn Close delivers an intense performance as the Vice President. Out of a possible '10', I give this film 3 pieces of cheese.

    just loved this movie,, first off ain't Gary Oldman the perfect bad azz for this movie,, Harrisson Ford delivers the knockout punch as the president,, and Glen Close as the VP,, very good touch, the president is left with a choice, either release a very bad man from a foreign prison or lose life on Air Force Once,, I don't imagine Obama would be fighting terrorists on a plane.. oops I voted for him,, o well.. so you have someone playing for the other side, and for awhile it's a guessing game as to who that might be,, I loved all the action in this movie,, you had gun play, fist fights,, explosions, a little bit of mystery thrown your way,, all in all I cant' find that much wrong with the movie at all and if I do it escapes me at the moment,, in a way you kinda root for our Russian cold war villain ,, kinda felt sorry for him in a way.. thought this was a great Harisson Ford movie,, way to go.

    I turned this movie off after the first five minutes. I can't stand the liberal elites in Hollywood who blast viewers with their political talking points within the first few minutes of what is suppose to be a thrilling action film. To further describe my outrage, the filmmakers have Harrison Ford's president character denounce the US for its failure to intervene in countries undergoing humanitarian crises. It's as if the benevolent elites in Hollywood want Americans who don't want to police the world and solve every single domestic problem facing less fortunate and successful countries to feel guilty about wanting the US to mind its own business and demand that American political authorities work for the interest of those who pay the damn bills in the first place. The filmmakers could've at least waited until the end of the film to sermonize viewers with their liberal propaganda.

    Tried again to watch this dross again on the TV last night. Failed again. I stood twenty minutes this time, until the bullshit meter went off the clock. The ridiculous SEAL team battle at the beginning where the baddies were all bad shots was laughable. Then the assault on the 747 with rifles firing on full auto was utterly ridiculous. It would have taken only one of these rounds to have punctured the pressure hull, yet none did. Why did some rooms on the plane seem to be huge offices on dry land and nothing like plane compartments ? To get past the obvious security checks simply have a platoons worth of M16s already on the plane for them to use. Surely a dumb move by the Secret Service, an even dumber move by the scriptwriters. Why did Ford and Oldman waste their time on this? Had a big bill just come in from the IRS ?

    OBS spoilers. The movie start of very good, some terrorist hijacks the airplane and takes hostages... Harrison Ford is hiding himself somewhere in the airplanes bottom... and then he kick some of the terrorists asses...,so far the movie is very good and very exiting. BUT in the last 20 minutes to movie just freaks out get VERY ridiculous, and that destroyed the hole movies. Everything was Very great except the last 20 minutes. But overall this is a really good movie that you should watch and the casting is very good also. Well the only bad thing with this movies is the last 20 minutes and the CGI is not very good it looks like some crappy video game especially when it crashes to the water at the end of movie.

    President James Marshall (Harrison Ford) is a no non-sense leader who just gave a zero tolerance on terrorism speech. Ironically, terrorists hijackers take over Air Force One. Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman) the leader of the terrorists is a Russian nationalist looking to free General Radek (J&uuml;rgen Prochnow) and replace the Russian government. Wolfgang Petersen directs this action movie. Forget about any realism problems, this is strictly a popcorn movie. There is no need to turn on your brain. Harrison Ford is a credible president, and more importantly, he is a credible action hero. The vice president (Glenn Close) is running things from the White House. There is just too much talking, negotiating, and too much international politics seriousness. At over 2 hours, there are too many slow parts. And the ending has way too many climaxes. They should think about who needs to be killed last. They should kill the big bad last because that should be the one big climax.

    Quick recap: Well without revealing it for everyone, lets just say the President is so bad-ass he saves the day, single-handedly killing all the bad guys a la Rambo (but with bare hands), then making love to all the women on board, before going on to land the plane blindfolded & gagged on an airstrip the size of a Brazilian, (no-one gets hurt) all the while jingoistic music is playing in the score and all the cast are chanting "USA, USA, USA". I can't remember who, where, how or indeed why this was recommended to me but whoever it was (i assume you know who you are) should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves, as should Ford, Oldman, Close & Macy. I hope the green was worth it.

    I love the film. Great idea from the writers and wise casting decision. Harrison Ford plays a good role here in addition to his previous roles like Han Solo, Indiana Jones, Dr. Richard Kimble and Jack Ryan, etc. During one of my surfing time in the net, I've found out that the Jack Ryan character became president of the United States so I've watched Air Force One again. How I wished the writers of this film collaborated with Tom Clancy to use the Jack Ryan character for their film. The film was already great, it would become super great if Jack Ryan was the main character but just like what I've said earlier great idea from the writers of this film. Another possibility for this film is a sequel. I've just watched White House Down last week. What a great film also. I've thought to use the characters from Air Force One particularly President James Marshall in that film. It would have been a great team up. Channing Tatum and Harrison Ford. Jaime Foxx also portrayed a good president there. For the conclusion, Air Force One is a good film. Worthy of preservation and accolades. I should have been a writer long ago. Air Force One starring Harrison Ford as President James Marshall (President Jack Ryan) Air Force One part two (White House Down) Opening lines for the trailer: First his plane was hijacked, now near the end of his presidency, his house has been trespassed. But this time he is not alone..... Harrison Ford as President James Marshall (President Jack Ryan) and Channing Tatum in a sequel to Air Force One White House Down

    Taking time out from being a statue in the park, Harry Ford is The President. Some dudes hijack his plane and chaos ensues. Mostly a Star Wars special effects convention with video game animation of the Air Force One 747 doing everything in the air except make coffee. The film doesn't fail to maintain a high level of excitement, but it simply goes on too long. By the time Ford takes control of the plane, I'm ready to see him land the damn thing so I can get up and go to the bathroom, but the gunfire and the melodramatics and the time I'm spending looking at the clock increases. Ford is his wooden self and Dean Stockwell looks and acts like Maxwell Smart, but the dependable Glenn Close delivers an intense performance as the Vice President. Out of a possible '10', I give this film 3 pieces of cheese.

    just loved this movie,, first off ain't Gary Oldman the perfect bad azz for this movie,, Harrisson Ford delivers the knockout punch as the president,, and Glen Close as the VP,, very good touch, the president is left with a choice, either release a very bad man from a foreign prison or lose life on Air Force Once,, I don't imagine Obama would be fighting terrorists on a plane.. oops I voted for him,, o well.. so you have someone playing for the other side, and for awhile it's a guessing game as to who that might be,, I loved all the action in this movie,, you had gun play, fist fights,, explosions, a little bit of mystery thrown your way,, all in all I cant' find that much wrong with the movie at all and if I do it escapes me at the moment,, in a way you kinda root for our Russian cold war villain ,, kinda felt sorry for him in a way.. thought this was a great Harisson Ford movie,, way to go.

    I turned this movie off after the first five minutes. I can't stand the liberal elites in Hollywood who blast viewers with their political talking points within the first few minutes of what is suppose to be a thrilling action film. To further describe my outrage, the filmmakers have Harrison Ford's president character denounce the US for its failure to intervene in countries undergoing humanitarian crises. It's as if the benevolent elites in Hollywood want Americans who don't want to police the world and solve every single domestic problem facing less fortunate and successful countries to feel guilty about wanting the US to mind its own business and demand that American political authorities work for the interest of those who pay the damn bills in the first place. The filmmakers could've at least waited until the end of the film to sermonize viewers with their liberal propaganda.

    Tried again to watch this dross again on the TV last night. Failed again. I stood twenty minutes this time, until the bullshit meter went off the clock. The ridiculous SEAL team battle at the beginning where the baddies were all bad shots was laughable. Then the assault on the 747 with rifles firing on full auto was utterly ridiculous. It would have taken only one of these rounds to have punctured the pressure hull, yet none did. Why did some rooms on the plane seem to be huge offices on dry land and nothing like plane compartments ? To get past the obvious security checks simply have a platoons worth of M16s already on the plane for them to use. Surely a dumb move by the Secret Service, an even dumber move by the scriptwriters. Why did Ford and Oldman waste their time on this? Had a big bill just come in from the IRS ?

    OBS spoilers. The movie start of very good, some terrorist hijacks the airplane and takes hostages... Harrison Ford is hiding himself somewhere in the airplanes bottom... and then he kick some of the terrorists asses...,so far the movie is very good and very exiting. BUT in the last 20 minutes to movie just freaks out get VERY ridiculous, and that destroyed the hole movies. Everything was Very great except the last 20 minutes. But overall this is a really good movie that you should watch and the casting is very good also. Well the only bad thing with this movies is the last 20 minutes and the CGI is not very good it looks like some crappy video game especially when it crashes to the water at the end of movie.

    President James Marshall (Harrison Ford) is a no non-sense leader who just gave a zero tolerance on terrorism speech. Ironically, terrorists hijackers take over Air Force One. Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman) the leader of the terrorists is a Russian nationalist looking to free General Radek (J&uuml;rgen Prochnow) and replace the Russian government. Wolfgang Petersen directs this action movie. Forget about any realism problems, this is strictly a popcorn movie. There is no need to turn on your brain. Harrison Ford is a credible president, and more importantly, he is a credible action hero. The vice president (Glenn Close) is running things from the White House. There is just too much talking, negotiating, and too much international politics seriousness. At over 2 hours, there are too many slow parts. And the ending has way too many climaxes. They should think about who needs to be killed last. They should kill the big bad last because that should be the one big climax.

    Air Force One. This was the first ever action film that I ever saw as a kid, and I have loved it ever since. It was the film that introduced me to two of my all time favorite actors, Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman, and introduced me to a kick-ass quality of movies which I compared to this. The story entails a band of Russian terrorists, led by the always brilliant and cunning Gary Oldman, sneaking aboard Air Force One, the president of the United State's personal aircraft. The president, played expertly by Harrison Ford, stays aboard to do combat with the terrorist in the bowels (baggage deck) of the airplane. It is kind of just "Die Hard on Air Force One" but I still think its good. I have to mention that this movie is directed by Wolfgang Petersen, the same man who gave us Das Boot, one of the greatest films ever made. He knows how to direct his actors with dignity and make them seem very real given these circumstances (except Poseidon that was a bad movie) The action scenes are very convincing, especially the mid-air rescue at the end of the movie, as well as the hand to hand combat that Ford engages in. The performances are absolutely phenomenal in this film. Harrison Ford gives us a President who goes with his gut on the new policy he gives at the beginning of the movie, and who will never leave his family to die, unlike everyone else who would bolt. Then there is Gary Oldman. Good God is this guy brilliant. His character Ivan is one of the best villains ever put to movies. He's a patriot, he's mean, he's tender about his past, he's imposing, and he is just menacing. Oldman is one of the best actors ever and when you put him with Harrison Ford, the chemistry between hero and villain is out of this world. Glenn Close rounds out as the iron willed Vice President who will still believe in the president even while the others aren't so sure given the predicament. Like Mary Poppins, this film introduced me to the great world of cinema and inspired me to become a filmmaker at a young age. There have been others as I have grown up, but this and the other movie I just mentioned are the two that got me rolling. A movie with good pacing, zippy action, and phenomenal acting, this is one of the best.

    The President goes to Moscow and gives a speech outlining the USA's new "Zero- tolerance" policy with respect to terrorism. On the flight home, terrorists take over Air Force One, and take the passengers, including his wife and daughter, hostage. The terrorists plan to execute one hostage every half-hour until their demands are met. However, the President is Harrison Ford, a former Medal of Honour winner..... How can anyone hate this movie, if you suspend your disbelief for two hours and try to ignore the blatant patriotism? Its Die Hard on a plane (again), but with Harrison Ford as The President of The USA. The pitch must have been amazing. Its a no brainier. I cannot think of anyone better for the role, and the casting of Oldman is genius, because at the time, thanks to Leon, The Fifth Element, and True Romance, he was the go to guy for playing the villain, plus he's British, and we all know that Brits are the best Bad Guys (according to Hollywood). Yes it's a silly film, and the script is cringeworthy (get off my plane is worthy of Schwarzennegar), but the action is solid, Ford will never be better, and Oldman is brilliant, even thought there is one line he spouts in a cockney accent. And for a two hour movie, it goes at a hectic pace, even when we go through the old round the table stuff with the VP and Dean Stockwell looking serious, like you do in all these types of movies. Turn off your brains for a couple of hours, and you will be in for a treat...

    just loved this movie,, first off ain't Gary Oldman the perfect bad azz for this movie,, Harrisson Ford delivers the knockout punch as the president,, and Glen Close as the VP,, very good touch, the president is left with a choice, either release a very bad man from a foreign prison or lose life on Air Force Once,, I don't imagine Obama would be fighting terrorists on a plane.. oops I voted for him,, o well.. so you have someone playing for the other side, and for awhile it's a guessing game as to who that might be,, I loved all the action in this movie,, you had gun play, fist fights,, explosions, a little bit of mystery thrown your way,, all in all I cant' find that much wrong with the movie at all and if I do it escapes me at the moment,, in a way you kinda root for our Russian cold war villain ,, kinda felt sorry for him in a way.. thought this was a great Harisson Ford movie,, way to go.

    I turned this movie off after the first five minutes. I can't stand the liberal elites in Hollywood who blast viewers with their political talking points within the first few minutes of what is suppose to be a thrilling action film. To further describe my outrage, the filmmakers have Harrison Ford's president character denounce the US for its failure to intervene in countries undergoing humanitarian crises. It's as if the benevolent elites in Hollywood want Americans who don't want to police the world and solve every single domestic problem facing less fortunate and successful countries to feel guilty about wanting the US to mind its own business and demand that American political authorities work for the interest of those who pay the damn bills in the first place. The filmmakers could've at least waited until the end of the film to sermonize viewers with their liberal propaganda.

    Tried again to watch this dross again on the TV last night. Failed again. I stood twenty minutes this time, until the bullshit meter went off the clock. The ridiculous SEAL team battle at the beginning where the baddies were all bad shots was laughable. Then the assault on the 747 with rifles firing on full auto was utterly ridiculous. It would have taken only one of these rounds to have punctured the pressure hull, yet none did. Why did some rooms on the plane seem to be huge offices on dry land and nothing like plane compartments ? To get past the obvious security checks simply have a platoons worth of M16s already on the plane for them to use. Surely a dumb move by the Secret Service, an even dumber move by the scriptwriters. Why did Ford and Oldman waste their time on this? Had a big bill just come in from the IRS ?

    OBS spoilers. The movie start of very good, some terrorist hijacks the airplane and takes hostages... Harrison Ford is hiding himself somewhere in the airplanes bottom... and then he kick some of the terrorists asses...,so far the movie is very good and very exiting. BUT in the last 20 minutes to movie just freaks out get VERY ridiculous, and that destroyed the hole movies. Everything was Very great except the last 20 minutes. But overall this is a really good movie that you should watch and the casting is very good also. Well the only bad thing with this movies is the last 20 minutes and the CGI is not very good it looks like some crappy video game especially when it crashes to the water at the end of movie.

    President James Marshall (Harrison Ford) is a no non-sense leader who just gave a zero tolerance on terrorism speech. Ironically, terrorists hijackers take over Air Force One. Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman) the leader of the terrorists is a Russian nationalist looking to free General Radek (J&uuml;rgen Prochnow) and replace the Russian government. Wolfgang Petersen directs this action movie. Forget about any realism problems, this is strictly a popcorn movie. There is no need to turn on your brain. Harrison Ford is a credible president, and more importantly, he is a credible action hero. The vice president (Glenn Close) is running things from the White House. There is just too much talking, negotiating, and too much international politics seriousness. At over 2 hours, there are too many slow parts. And the ending has way too many climaxes. They should think about who needs to be killed last. They should kill the big bad last because that should be the one big climax.

    Air Force One. This was the first ever action film that I ever saw as a kid, and I have loved it ever since. It was the film that introduced me to two of my all time favorite actors, Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman, and introduced me to a kick-ass quality of movies which I compared to this. The story entails a band of Russian terrorists, led by the always brilliant and cunning Gary Oldman, sneaking aboard Air Force One, the president of the United State's personal aircraft. The president, played expertly by Harrison Ford, stays aboard to do combat with the terrorist in the bowels (baggage deck) of the airplane. It is kind of just "Die Hard on Air Force One" but I still think its good. I have to mention that this movie is directed by Wolfgang Petersen, the same man who gave us Das Boot, one of the greatest films ever made. He knows how to direct his actors with dignity and make them seem very real given these circumstances (except Poseidon that was a bad movie) The action scenes are very convincing, especially the mid-air rescue at the end of the movie, as well as the hand to hand combat that Ford engages in. The performances are absolutely phenomenal in this film. Harrison Ford gives us a President who goes with his gut on the new policy he gives at the beginning of the movie, and who will never leave his family to die, unlike everyone else who would bolt. Then there is Gary Oldman. Good God is this guy brilliant. His character Ivan is one of the best villains ever put to movies. He's a patriot, he's mean, he's tender about his past, he's imposing, and he is just menacing. Oldman is one of the best actors ever and when you put him with Harrison Ford, the chemistry between hero and villain is out of this world. Glenn Close rounds out as the iron willed Vice President who will still believe in the president even while the others aren't so sure given the predicament. Like Mary Poppins, this film introduced me to the great world of cinema and inspired me to become a filmmaker at a young age. There have been others as I have grown up, but this and the other movie I just mentioned are the two that got me rolling. A movie with good pacing, zippy action, and phenomenal acting, this is one of the best.

    The President goes to Moscow and gives a speech outlining the USA's new "Zero- tolerance" policy with respect to terrorism. On the flight home, terrorists take over Air Force One, and take the passengers, including his wife and daughter, hostage. The terrorists plan to execute one hostage every half-hour until their demands are met. However, the President is Harrison Ford, a former Medal of Honour winner..... How can anyone hate this movie, if you suspend your disbelief for two hours and try to ignore the blatant patriotism? Its Die Hard on a plane (again), but with Harrison Ford as The President of The USA. The pitch must have been amazing. Its a no brainier. I cannot think of anyone better for the role, and the casting of Oldman is genius, because at the time, thanks to Leon, The Fifth Element, and True Romance, he was the go to guy for playing the villain, plus he's British, and we all know that Brits are the best Bad Guys (according to Hollywood). Yes it's a silly film, and the script is cringeworthy (get off my plane is worthy of Schwarzennegar), but the action is solid, Ford will never be better, and Oldman is brilliant, even thought there is one line he spouts in a cockney accent. And for a two hour movie, it goes at a hectic pace, even when we go through the old round the table stuff with the VP and Dean Stockwell looking serious, like you do in all these types of movies. Turn off your brains for a couple of hours, and you will be in for a treat...

    Quick recap: Well without revealing it for everyone, lets just say the President is so bad-ass he saves the day, single-handedly killing all the bad guys a la Rambo (but with bare hands), then making love to all the women on board, before going on to land the plane blindfolded & gagged on an airstrip the size of a Brazilian, (no-one gets hurt) all the while jingoistic music is playing in the score and all the cast are chanting "USA, USA, USA". I can't remember who, where, how or indeed why this was recommended to me but whoever it was (i assume you know who you are) should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves, as should Ford, Oldman, Close & Macy. I hope the green was worth it.

    I love the film. Great idea from the writers and wise casting decision. Harrison Ford plays a good role here in addition to his previous roles like Han Solo, Indiana Jones, Dr. Richard Kimble and Jack Ryan, etc. During one of my surfing time in the net, I've found out that the Jack Ryan character became president of the United States so I've watched Air Force One again. How I wished the writers of this film collaborated with Tom Clancy to use the Jack Ryan character for their film. The film was already great, it would become super great if Jack Ryan was the main character but just like what I've said earlier great idea from the writers of this film. Another possibility for this film is a sequel. I've just watched White House Down last week. What a great film also. I've thought to use the characters from Air Force One particularly President James Marshall in that film. It would have been a great team up. Channing Tatum and Harrison Ford. Jaime Foxx also portrayed a good president there. For the conclusion, Air Force One is a good film. Worthy of preservation and accolades. I should have been a writer long ago. Air Force One starring Harrison Ford as President James Marshall (President Jack Ryan) Air Force One part two (White House Down) Opening lines for the trailer: First his plane was hijacked, now near the end of his presidency, his house has been trespassed. But this time he is not alone..... Harrison Ford as President James Marshall (President Jack Ryan) and Channing Tatum in a sequel to Air Force One White House Down

    Taking time out from being a statue in the park, Harry Ford is The President. Some dudes hijack his plane and chaos ensues. Mostly a Star Wars special effects convention with video game animation of the Air Force One 747 doing everything in the air except make coffee. The film doesn't fail to maintain a high level of excitement, but it simply goes on too long. By the time Ford takes control of the plane, I'm ready to see him land the damn thing so I can get up and go to the bathroom, but the gunfire and the melodramatics and the time I'm spending looking at the clock increases. Ford is his wooden self and Dean Stockwell looks and acts like Maxwell Smart, but the dependable Glenn Close delivers an intense performance as the Vice President. Out of a possible '10', I give this film 3 pieces of cheese.

Well the only bad thing with this movies is the last 20 minutes and the CGI is not very good it looks like some crappy video game especially when it crashes to the water at the end of movie.

    President James Marshall (Harrison Ford) is a no non-sense leader who just gave a zero tolerance on terrorism speech. Ironically, terrorists hijackers take over Air Force One. Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman) the leader of the terrorists is a Russian nationalist looking to free General Radek (J&uuml;rgen Prochnow) and replace the Russian government. Wolfgang Petersen directs this action movie. Forget about any realism problems, this is strictly a popcorn movie. There is no need to turn on your brain. Harrison Ford is a credible president, and more importantly, he is a credible action hero. The vice president (Glenn Close) is running things from the White House. There is just too much talking, negotiating, and too much international politics seriousness. At over 2 hours, there are too many slow parts. And the ending has way too many climaxes. They should think about who needs to be killed last. They should kill the big bad last because that should be the one big climax.

    Air Force One. This was the first ever action film that I ever saw as a kid, and I have loved it ever since. It was the film that introduced me to two of my all time favorite actors, Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman, and introduced me to a kick-ass quality of movies which I compared to this. The story entails a band of Russian terrorists, led by the always brilliant and cunning Gary Oldman, sneaking aboard Air Force One, the president of the United State's personal aircraft. The president, played expertly by Harrison Ford, stays aboard to do combat with the terrorist in the bowels (baggage deck) of the airplane. It is kind of just "Die Hard on Air Force One" but I still think its good. I have to mention that this movie is directed by Wolfgang Petersen, the same man who gave us Das Boot, one of the greatest films ever made. He knows how to direct his actors with dignity and make them seem very real given these circumstances (except Poseidon that was a bad movie) The action scenes are very convincing, especially the mid-air rescue at the end of the movie, as well as the hand to hand combat that Ford engages in. The performances are absolutely phenomenal in this film. Harrison Ford gives us a President who goes with his gut on the new policy he gives at the beginning of the movie, and who will never leave his family to die, unlike everyone else who would bolt. Then there is Gary Oldman. Good God is this guy brilliant. His character Ivan is one of the best villains ever put to movies. He's a patriot, he's mean, he's tender about his past, he's imposing, and he is just menacing. Oldman is one of the best actors ever and when you put him with Harrison Ford, the chemistry between hero and villain is out of this world. Glenn Close rounds out as the iron willed Vice President who will still believe in the president even while the others aren't so sure given the predicament. Like Mary Poppins, this film introduced me to the great world of cinema and inspired me to become a filmmaker at a young age. There have been others as I have grown up, but this and the other movie I just mentioned are the two that got me rolling. A movie with good pacing, zippy action, and phenomenal acting, this is one of the best.

    The President goes to Moscow and gives a speech outlining the USA's new "Zero- tolerance" policy with respect to terrorism. On the flight home, terrorists take over Air Force One, and take the passengers, including his wife and daughter, hostage. The terrorists plan to execute one hostage every half-hour until their demands are met. However, the President is Harrison Ford, a former Medal of Honour winner..... How can anyone hate this movie, if you suspend your disbelief for two hours and try to ignore the blatant patriotism? Its Die Hard on a plane (again), but with Harrison Ford as The President of The USA. The pitch must have been amazing. Its a no brainier. I cannot think of anyone better for the role, and the casting of Oldman is genius, because at the time, thanks to Leon, The Fifth Element, and True Romance, he was the go to guy for playing the villain, plus he's British, and we all know that Brits are the best Bad Guys (according to Hollywood). Yes it's a silly film, and the script is cringeworthy (get off my plane is worthy of Schwarzennegar), but the action is solid, Ford will never be better, and Oldman is brilliant, even thought there is one line he spouts in a cockney accent. And for a two hour movie, it goes at a hectic pace, even when we go through the old round the table stuff with the VP and Dean Stockwell looking serious, like you do in all these types of movies. Turn off your brains for a couple of hours, and you will be in for a treat...

    Quick recap: Well without revealing it for everyone, lets just say the President is so bad-ass he saves the day, single-handedly killing all the bad guys a la Rambo (but with bare hands), then making love to all the women on board, before going on to land the plane blindfolded & gagged on an airstrip the size of a Brazilian, (no-one gets hurt) all the while jingoistic music is playing in the score and all the cast are chanting "USA, USA, USA". I can't remember who, where, how or indeed why this was recommended to me but whoever it was (i assume you know who you are) should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves, as should Ford, Oldman, Close & Macy. I hope the green was worth it.

    I love the film. Great idea from the writers and wise casting decision. Harrison Ford plays a good role here in addition to his previous roles like Han Solo, Indiana Jones, Dr. Richard Kimble and Jack Ryan, etc. During one of my surfing time in the net, I've found out that the Jack Ryan character became president of the United States so I've watched Air Force One again. How I wished the writers of this film collaborated with Tom Clancy to use the Jack Ryan character for their film. The film was already great, it would become super great if Jack Ryan was the main character but just like what I've said earlier great idea from the writers of this film. Another possibility for this film is a sequel. I've just watched White House Down last week. What a great film also. I've thought to use the characters from Air Force One particularly President James Marshall in that film. It would have been a great team up. Channing Tatum and Harrison Ford. Jaime Foxx also portrayed a good president there. For the conclusion, Air Force One is a good film. Worthy of preservation and accolades. I should have been a writer long ago. Air Force One starring Harrison Ford as President James Marshall (President Jack Ryan) Air Force One part two (White House Down) Opening lines for the trailer: First his plane was hijacked, now near the end of his presidency, his house has been trespassed. But this time he is not alone..... Harrison Ford as President James Marshall (President Jack Ryan) and Channing Tatum in a sequel to Air Force One White House Down

    Taking time out from being a statue in the park, Harry Ford is The President. Some dudes hijack his plane and chaos ensues. Mostly a Star Wars special effects convention with video game animation of the Air Force One 747 doing everything in the air except make coffee. The film doesn't fail to maintain a high level of excitement, but it simply goes on too long. By the time Ford takes control of the plane, I'm ready to see him land the damn thing so I can get up and go to the bathroom, but the gunfire and the melodramatics and the time I'm spending looking at the clock increases. Ford is his wooden self and Dean Stockwell looks and acts like Maxwell Smart, but the dependable Glenn Close delivers an intense performance as the Vice President. Out of a possible '10', I give this film 3 pieces of cheese.

    just loved this movie,, first off ain't Gary Oldman the perfect bad azz for this movie,, Harrisson Ford delivers the knockout punch as the president,, and Glen Close as the VP,, very good touch, the president is left with a choice, either release a very bad man from a foreign prison or lose life on Air Force Once,, I don't imagine Obama would be fighting terrorists on a plane.. oops I voted for him,, o well.. so you have someone playing for the other side, and for awhile it's a guessing game as to who that might be,, I loved all the action in this movie,, you had gun play, fist fights,, explosions, a little bit of mystery thrown your way,, all in all I cant' find that much wrong with the movie at all and if I do it escapes me at the moment,, in a way you kinda root for our Russian cold war villain ,, kinda felt sorry for him in a way.. thought this was a great Harisson Ford movie,, way to go.

    I turned this movie off after the first five minutes. I can't stand the liberal elites in Hollywood who blast viewers with their political talking points within the first few minutes of what is suppose to be a thrilling action film. To further describe my outrage, the filmmakers have Harrison Ford's president character denounce the US for its failure to intervene in countries undergoing humanitarian crises. It's as if the benevolent elites in Hollywood want Americans who don't want to police the world and solve every single domestic problem facing less fortunate and successful countries to feel guilty about wanting the US to mind its own business and demand that American political authorities work for the interest of those who pay the damn bills in the first place. The filmmakers could've at least waited until the end of the film to sermonize viewers with their liberal propaganda.

    Tried again to watch this dross again on the TV last night. Failed again. I stood twenty minutes this time, until the bullshit meter went off the clock. The ridiculous SEAL team battle at the beginning where the baddies were all bad shots was laughable. Then the assault on the 747 with rifles firing on full auto was utterly ridiculous. It would have taken only one of these rounds to have punctured the pressure hull, yet none did. Why did some rooms on the plane seem to be huge offices on dry land and nothing like plane compartments ? To get past the obvious security checks simply have a platoons worth of M16s already on the plane for them to use. Surely a dumb move by the Secret Service, an even dumber move by the scriptwriters. Why did Ford and Oldman waste their time on this? Had a big bill just come in from the IRS ?
