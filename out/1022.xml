 <storyline>
  What do an elderly topiary gardener, a retired lion tamer, a man fascinated by mole rats, and a cutting-edge robotics designer have in common? Both nothing and everything in this unconventional documentary directed by Erroll Morris. Fast, Cheap & Out of Control (Referring to the robot specialist's strange philosophy of robot design structure, not Erroll Morris's documentary techniques!) interplays, overlaps, and interrelates these four separate and highly specialized documentary subjects in order to in truth study all of humanity, raising questions about the future of mankind.

    The foremost thing that can let a documentary work out as a good and interesting one is its subject. And let me just say, I could barely finish watching this documentary! There were several issues I was having with this documentary. The first is the most obvious one, that this documentary is focusing on four unrelated persons and completely different subjects. You could say that they are all connected through their passion for their work but there are millions of people out there with a passion for something. I mean, what makes these guys so special and worthy of featuring them in a documentary? And that brings me to the other problem of that the documentary just doesn't ever manage to get deep or involving with anything. The way it's set up, is that it just lets its subjects talk about their work but it doesn't tell you anything about the person itself, or what drives and motivates him. You were supposed to take all of this out of the way they were talking about their work I suppose but it just didn't worked out too well for me. It might had worked out for me if the different subjects were being a bit more interesting ones. But one involves a gardener, the other a robotics designer and the other a guy who is fascinated by mole rats. The one interesting subject involves a lion tamer but because every different subjects take up about as much screen time as the other, the documentary just doesn't ever find the time or space to let any of them work out as something good and interesting enough. It was really lacking some depth, which was due to the combination of its concepts and the approach to all of it. It actually became a very repetitive documentary after a while, since nothing in it ever felt as if it was progressing and going anywhere interesting or surprising. The style also became repetitive and predictable after a short while. The style actually seemed to be the foremost thing that was supposed to keep this documentary together and provide it with pace and visual splendor (with the help of acclaimed cinematographer Robert Richardson) as well but it really started to work against the documentary after a while. It actually helped to prevent this documentary from ever becoming a well enough focused one. I'm not exaggerating when I'm saying that, about half way through the documentary, I already got fed up with it and lost all interest. I really had a hard time finish watching it and when it finally did, I was glad it was all over with. It's not like I hated watching it but it just was a documentary I got absolutely nothing out of! 5/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    There are so many problems with this so-called documentary I don't know where to begin. For starters, this is really a fake documentary. There is so much stock footage and scenes from an old film strewn throughout, one wonders if the title Morris came up with for this film actually refers to his OWN film and how he made it. He probably shot this very quickly, very cheaply, and is just plain out of control as this story is a big mess. Most of this film is entirely boring, and most of the anecdotes the 4 subjects relate are boring. This film is also filled with scenes that have nothing to do with the story being told and it shows. How Roger Ebert and some other critics could have listed this in their top 10 the year it came out is shocking. One of the biggest problems, is that none of the 4 people being interviewed are very interesting. In truth, they probably could be, or likely have interesting things that could have been related/shown, but they all come off boring... and this is clearly Morris' fault, not the 4 people's. The lion tamer is the more interesting of the bunch, but he still is pretty boring in Morris' hands. What a shame. What a waste of celluloid. I really expected a better film, because I recall some of the critical claim it had gotten 14 or 15 years ago. But now that I finally saw this on one of the movie channels, those critics must have been on drugs. Actually... that might be the way to view this film... if you're high, you might actually like it since it's all over the place with weird, non-linear footage. And then if you fall asleep, you won't miss anything.

    My small survey of documentary types has brought me to this, and what a celebration! This is complex, meaningful cinema that just happens to be a documentary. It is intelligent, complex, deliberate and deeply thought provoking. I think it communicates something that isn't quite right, but the thing is communicated in the most effective way  by folding the idea being explained into the form of the explanation, the film itself. The core of this is the work of Rodney Brooks. He is a celebrated researcher in robotics and now the founder of the most promising company making these things. He is smart, articulate and the things he makes work as advertised. I've encountered him and his work professionally over the last 30 years. He makes machines that walk, and have some cognitive navigation skills. Walking is hard. While there are many research centers working on robotics, there are only two universities working on the underlying theories. MIT is the least shallow of these. Add in the fact that Brooks has manufactured thousands of graduates in his style of thinking, and you may appreciate why he may be one of the most influential thinkers on the planet. The theory here is that instead of thinking about a single brain, it makes sense to think in terms of a society of collaborating miniminds, agents. As a metaphor, bees, ants, termites are usual. And as usual, the metaphor in most quarters is taken too literally. Brooks does not quite do so, but this is the first compromise made by the filmmaker. Making agents systems that have the behavior you want is impossible without some structure in the society. A promising approach is to go deep and restructure logic. Instead, Brooks structures the agents into "subsumptive" layers. This mirrors special purpose roles of termites and molerats in colonies. Okay, here is an idea, an interesting one, and one that is already embedded in the general intellectual economy. Around this, Morris builds a film. Nominally, there are four "geniuses." One is our robotics theorist. We have an obsessive expert in molerats, so we have our metaphor made whole. We have a lion tamer. Now he fits into the idea architecture by explaining how he repeatedly risks his life to figure out and superficially control inscrutable animals. And finally we have a guy who reverses the metaphor; he takes living things with their natural agent system that wants to behave one way, and he forces it to look like larger living things. The resemblance is superficial and fragile. Two of these form the cinematic spine: the circus and the robots. Most of what we see apart from the four individuals themselves is a collage of circus footage and splices from old robot movies. We also have the synthesis of old "circus" movies with robotic influence. Peppered in are the two other guys and their cinematic expression. With the molerats, we have  well film of molerats. With the topiarist, we have some artistically photographed scenes of him working in the garden. The score is important in Morris films; here the composer tries to build subsumptive music, taking themes from movies and other recognizable sources, assigning them to types of clips we see, and subsuming them into a klezmer- inspired circus score where we are the audience. This really is a carefully structured piece of cinema, visually conveying ideas much deeper than one normally allows. The problem is that like the four men we are shown, the approach is still discrete, reductionist. It assumes that great sweeps of life can be logical, explained. We go to the circus and topiary garden to see this narrative. An influential professor treats grad students like so many ants, incrementally evolving "the system." A fellow "explains" the colony, as if observations equals insights. So here is the quandary with film and ideas. Film is about showing. The best ideas are about abstracting away distracting (and often false) appearances. A long form narrative film takes you places where you can invent your insights, with some guidance. A documentary feeds insights, but has to stick more with the "sight" than the "in." Still, the structure here and the ambition! It isn't real, but it does not have to be to warm us. Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.

    As you watch this film, you go through three phases: 1) What the heck is this? 2) Fascination 3) Synthesis - What does it all mean? Here's where I came out after a couple days of reflecting on the last question: These four guys have jobs that are quirky and about as different from one another as they could be. None the less, each man is fully absorbed in what he does and uses his job, over the course of a life time, as a meditation on two questions; Who am I? and What is the nature of the world? By the end, they all come to consistent conclusions about themselves, and because of the way their dialogue and images are interspersed, they blur and seem to merge into one single person. That one person then is absorbed by the world of their own mutual conception. The film is ambitious in undertaking these big questions and I think ultimately successful.

    Four obsessed men explaining their individual interests (wild animal trainer, topiary gardener, naked mole rat expert, robot designer) is how I would describe "Fast, Cheap & Out of Control". The documentary is somewhat redundant and not entirely successful. It might have benefited from a couple more eccentric characters, or perhaps telling a little about the topiary guy's wife for instance. The circus scenes and old black and white movie that strung the stories together was inadequate for maintaining interest through 82 minutes. The film's central theme seemed to be emphasizing the very thin line that separates madness from genius. These very original characters came across as both fascinating and sad. - MERK

    This documentary from Errol Morris is about four people and their jobs. They all share some common interest and I think Morris intended this to be "mankind's control over nature", though to me the connection was much simpler--all four had neat jobs and all four had an intense passion for what they did. Rarely have I seen people who love their work as much as these four men and because of this I found that there was a very likable sort of nobility about them. Some of the jobs seemed more exciting than others, but all four seemed intensely satisfied with their own particular job. There jobs were lion tamer, robotics professor, naked mole rat curator and master gardener/topiary expert. As for the style of the film, some of the negative criticisms others level against this film I just didn't agree with, though one I certainly did. The connecting archival film clips sometimes worked well and fit what was being said and done, though some just looked cheap and out of place--particularly the movie serial clips. However, despite this possible unfortunate choice, I loved the music, way of interconnecting the stories and overall format. Interesting and well worth a look if you like quirky documentaries. I liked this far more than Morris' first film, GATES OF HEAVEN (which was very stark and aimless compared to this one) and not as amazing as MR. DEATH--one of the best documentaries I have ever seen.

    I found the documentary entitled Fast, Cheap, and Out of Control to be a fairly interesting documentary. The documentary contained four "mini" documentaries about four interesting men. Each one of these men was extremely involved with his job, showing sheer love and enjoyment for one's job. The sad part, I must say, would have to be the subjects in which these individuals worked/studied. They were interesting for about five minutes, afterwards becoming boring and lasting entirely too long. The video was filmed in a very creative way though. I very much enjoyed the film of one thing with a voice dub over another. It played out excellent and also coincided nicely with the music.

    this movie was a little hard for me to get interested in. the way it was filmed, and how the information was presented was very entertaining, but the information itself was rather boring in my opinion. it's not a movie i would rush to the nearest rental store to get by any means. But if i saw it was on TV i might flip to it and watch it for a few minutes, then would become bored and find something a little more entertaining. All in all this is not a movie i would want to watch more than once, which is a major contribution in how i rate movies. if it entertains me enough to watch it more than once, i would give it a semi good or good rating, but if don't enjoy it enough to watch it more than once, it automatically becomes a pass in my book.

    This was a strange film, one that I'm not sure I completely understood. The editing was a little "out of control" all on its own. This is a review of four seemingly different careers- An animal trainer for the circus, a topiary gardener, a naked mole rat specialist, and a robot scientist. The film tried to find similarities between these three unique jobs. While this was interesting, informative, and slightly satirical, I did not find this a film that I would race to see again. My lack of total enthusiasm in regards to something like this may be only an individual's preference, so I cannot say I detested this movie, and not to see it.

    This was an interesting film,that would attract the attention of all ages for its bizarreness, and its uniqueness. It doesn't have the normal plot of most movies but contains an interesting unexpected list of characters which all pertain different jobs that are often not recognized and are found rare in the world. This movie will attract the interests and will possibly help and open a new range of career opportunities to the world that most have failed to recognize. These jobs not only take patience but passion, and willingness to go outside the box, rather than sit at work in your small cubicle watching the clock tick till you get off. This movie might create a greater desire in you to want to know more about this random jobs, which have now been introduced to you.

The sad part, I must say, would have to be the subjects in which these individuals worked/studied. They were interesting for about five minutes, afterwards becoming boring and lasting entirely too long. The video was filmed in a very creative way though. I very much enjoyed the film of one thing with a voice dub over another. It played out excellent and also coincided nicely with the music.

    this movie was a little hard for me to get interested in. the way it was filmed, and how the information was presented was very entertaining, but the information itself was rather boring in my opinion. it's not a movie i would rush to the nearest rental store to get by any means. But if i saw it was on TV i might flip to it and watch it for a few minutes, then would become bored and find something a little more entertaining. All in all this is not a movie i would want to watch more than once, which is a major contribution in how i rate movies. if it entertains me enough to watch it more than once, i would give it a semi good or good rating, but if don't enjoy it enough to watch it more than once, it automatically becomes a pass in my book.

    This was a strange film, one that I'm not sure I completely understood. The editing was a little "out of control" all on its own. This is a review of four seemingly different careers- An animal trainer for the circus, a topiary gardener, a naked mole rat specialist, and a robot scientist. The film tried to find similarities between these three unique jobs. While this was interesting, informative, and slightly satirical, I did not find this a film that I would race to see again. My lack of total enthusiasm in regards to something like this may be only an individual's preference, so I cannot say I detested this movie, and not to see it.

    This was an interesting film,that would attract the attention of all ages for its bizarreness, and its uniqueness. It doesn't have the normal plot of most movies but contains an interesting unexpected list of characters which all pertain different jobs that are often not recognized and are found rare in the world. This movie will attract the interests and will possibly help and open a new range of career opportunities to the world that most have failed to recognize. These jobs not only take patience but passion, and willingness to go outside the box, rather than sit at work in your small cubicle watching the clock tick till you get off. This movie might create a greater desire in you to want to know more about this random jobs, which have now been introduced to you.

    The foremost thing that can let a documentary work out as a good and interesting one is its subject. And let me just say, I could barely finish watching this documentary! There were several issues I was having with this documentary. The first is the most obvious one, that this documentary is focusing on four unrelated persons and completely different subjects. You could say that they are all connected through their passion for their work but there are millions of people out there with a passion for something. I mean, what makes these guys so special and worthy of featuring them in a documentary? And that brings me to the other problem of that the documentary just doesn't ever manage to get deep or involving with anything. The way it's set up, is that it just lets its subjects talk about their work but it doesn't tell you anything about the person itself, or what drives and motivates him. You were supposed to take all of this out of the way they were talking about their work I suppose but it just didn't worked out too well for me. It might had worked out for me if the different subjects were being a bit more interesting ones. But one involves a gardener, the other a robotics designer and the other a guy who is fascinated by mole rats. The one interesting subject involves a lion tamer but because every different subjects take up about as much screen time as the other, the documentary just doesn't ever find the time or space to let any of them work out as something good and interesting enough. It was really lacking some depth, which was due to the combination of its concepts and the approach to all of it. It actually became a very repetitive documentary after a while, since nothing in it ever felt as if it was progressing and going anywhere interesting or surprising. The style also became repetitive and predictable after a short while. The style actually seemed to be the foremost thing that was supposed to keep this documentary together and provide it with pace and visual splendor (with the help of acclaimed cinematographer Robert Richardson) as well but it really started to work against the documentary after a while. It actually helped to prevent this documentary from ever becoming a well enough focused one. I'm not exaggerating when I'm saying that, about half way through the documentary, I already got fed up with it and lost all interest. I really had a hard time finish watching it and when it finally did, I was glad it was all over with. It's not like I hated watching it but it just was a documentary I got absolutely nothing out of! 5/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    There are so many problems with this so-called documentary I don't know where to begin. For starters, this is really a fake documentary. There is so much stock footage and scenes from an old film strewn throughout, one wonders if the title Morris came up with for this film actually refers to his OWN film and how he made it. He probably shot this very quickly, very cheaply, and is just plain out of control as this story is a big mess. Most of this film is entirely boring, and most of the anecdotes the 4 subjects relate are boring. This film is also filled with scenes that have nothing to do with the story being told and it shows. How Roger Ebert and some other critics could have listed this in their top 10 the year it came out is shocking. One of the biggest problems, is that none of the 4 people being interviewed are very interesting. In truth, they probably could be, or likely have interesting things that could have been related/shown, but they all come off boring... and this is clearly Morris' fault, not the 4 people's. The lion tamer is the more interesting of the bunch, but he still is pretty boring in Morris' hands. What a shame. What a waste of celluloid. I really expected a better film, because I recall some of the critical claim it had gotten 14 or 15 years ago. But now that I finally saw this on one of the movie channels, those critics must have been on drugs. Actually... that might be the way to view this film... if you're high, you might actually like it since it's all over the place with weird, non-linear footage. And then if you fall asleep, you won't miss anything.

    My small survey of documentary types has brought me to this, and what a celebration! This is complex, meaningful cinema that just happens to be a documentary. It is intelligent, complex, deliberate and deeply thought provoking. I think it communicates something that isn't quite right, but the thing is communicated in the most effective way  by folding the idea being explained into the form of the explanation, the film itself. The core of this is the work of Rodney Brooks. He is a celebrated researcher in robotics and now the founder of the most promising company making these things. He is smart, articulate and the things he makes work as advertised. I've encountered him and his work professionally over the last 30 years. He makes machines that walk, and have some cognitive navigation skills. Walking is hard. While there are many research centers working on robotics, there are only two universities working on the underlying theories. MIT is the least shallow of these. Add in the fact that Brooks has manufactured thousands of graduates in his style of thinking, and you may appreciate why he may be one of the most influential thinkers on the planet. The theory here is that instead of thinking about a single brain, it makes sense to think in terms of a society of collaborating miniminds, agents. As a metaphor, bees, ants, termites are usual. And as usual, the metaphor in most quarters is taken too literally. Brooks does not quite do so, but this is the first compromise made by the filmmaker. Making agents systems that have the behavior you want is impossible without some structure in the society. A promising approach is to go deep and restructure logic. Instead, Brooks structures the agents into "subsumptive" layers. This mirrors special purpose roles of termites and molerats in colonies. Okay, here is an idea, an interesting one, and one that is already embedded in the general intellectual economy. Around this, Morris builds a film. Nominally, there are four "geniuses." One is our robotics theorist. We have an obsessive expert in molerats, so we have our metaphor made whole. We have a lion tamer. Now he fits into the idea architecture by explaining how he repeatedly risks his life to figure out and superficially control inscrutable animals. And finally we have a guy who reverses the metaphor; he takes living things with their natural agent system that wants to behave one way, and he forces it to look like larger living things. The resemblance is superficial and fragile. Two of these form the cinematic spine: the circus and the robots. Most of what we see apart from the four individuals themselves is a collage of circus footage and splices from old robot movies. We also have the synthesis of old "circus" movies with robotic influence. Peppered in are the two other guys and their cinematic expression. With the molerats, we have  well film of molerats. With the topiarist, we have some artistically photographed scenes of him working in the garden. The score is important in Morris films; here the composer tries to build subsumptive music, taking themes from movies and other recognizable sources, assigning them to types of clips we see, and subsuming them into a klezmer- inspired circus score where we are the audience. This really is a carefully structured piece of cinema, visually conveying ideas much deeper than one normally allows. The problem is that like the four men we are shown, the approach is still discrete, reductionist. It assumes that great sweeps of life can be logical, explained. We go to the circus and topiary garden to see this narrative. An influential professor treats grad students like so many ants, incrementally evolving "the system." A fellow "explains" the colony, as if observations equals insights. So here is the quandary with film and ideas. Film is about showing. The best ideas are about abstracting away distracting (and often false) appearances. A long form narrative film takes you places where you can invent your insights, with some guidance. A documentary feeds insights, but has to stick more with the "sight" than the "in." Still, the structure here and the ambition! It isn't real, but it does not have to be to warm us.

    As you watch this film, you go through three phases: 1) What the heck is this? 2) Fascination 3) Synthesis - What does it all mean? Here's where I came out after a couple days of reflecting on the last question: These four guys have jobs that are quirky and about as different from one another as they could be. None the less, each man is fully absorbed in what he does and uses his job, over the course of a life time, as a meditation on two questions; Who am I? and What is the nature of the world? By the end, they all come to consistent conclusions about themselves, and because of the way their dialogue and images are interspersed, they blur and seem to merge into one single person. That one person then is absorbed by the world of their own mutual conception. The film is ambitious in undertaking these big questions and I think ultimately successful.

    Four obsessed men explaining their individual interests (wild animal trainer, topiary gardener, naked mole rat expert, robot designer) is how I would describe "Fast, Cheap & Out of Control". The documentary is somewhat redundant and not entirely successful. It might have benefited from a couple more eccentric characters, or perhaps telling a little about the topiary guy's wife for instance. The circus scenes and old black and white movie that strung the stories together was inadequate for maintaining interest through 82 minutes. The film's central theme seemed to be emphasizing the very thin line that separates madness from genius. These very original characters came across as both fascinating and sad. - MERK

    This documentary from Errol Morris is about four people and their jobs. They all share some common interest and I think Morris intended this to be "mankind's control over nature", though to me the connection was much simpler--all four had neat jobs and all four had an intense passion for what they did. Rarely have I seen people who love their work as much as these four men and because of this I found that there was a very likable sort of nobility about them. Some of the jobs seemed more exciting than others, but all four seemed intensely satisfied with their own particular job. There jobs were lion tamer, robotics professor, naked mole rat curator and master gardener/topiary expert. As for the style of the film, some of the negative criticisms others level against this film I just didn't agree with, though one I certainly did. The connecting archival film clips sometimes worked well and fit what was being said and done, though some just looked cheap and out of place--particularly the movie serial clips. However, despite this possible unfortunate choice, I loved the music, way of interconnecting the stories and overall format. Interesting and well worth a look if you like quirky documentaries. I liked this far more than Morris' first film, GATES OF HEAVEN (which was very stark and aimless compared to this one) and not as amazing as MR. DEATH--one of the best documentaries I have ever seen.

They all share some common interest and I think Morris intended this to be "mankind's control over nature", though to me the connection was much simpler--all four had neat jobs and all four had an intense passion for what they did. Rarely have I seen people who love their work as much as these four men and because of this I found that there was a very likable sort of nobility about them. Some of the jobs seemed more exciting than others, but all four seemed intensely satisfied with their own particular job. There jobs were lion tamer, robotics professor, naked mole rat curator and master gardener/topiary expert. As for the style of the film, some of the negative criticisms others level against this film I just didn't agree with, though one I certainly did. The connecting archival film clips sometimes worked well and fit what was being said and done, though some just looked cheap and out of place--particularly the movie serial clips. However, despite this possible unfortunate choice, I loved the music, way of interconnecting the stories and overall format. Interesting and well worth a look if you like quirky documentaries. I liked this far more than Morris' first film, GATES OF HEAVEN (which was very stark and aimless compared to this one) and not as amazing as MR. DEATH--one of the best documentaries I have ever seen.

    I found the documentary entitled Fast, Cheap, and Out of Control to be a fairly interesting documentary. The documentary contained four "mini" documentaries about four interesting men. Each one of these men was extremely involved with his job, showing sheer love and enjoyment for one's job. The sad part, I must say, would have to be the subjects in which these individuals worked/studied. They were interesting for about five minutes, afterwards becoming boring and lasting entirely too long. The video was filmed in a very creative way though. I very much enjoyed the film of one thing with a voice dub over another. It played out excellent and also coincided nicely with the music.

    this movie was a little hard for me to get interested in. the way it was filmed, and how the information was presented was very entertaining, but the information itself was rather boring in my opinion. it's not a movie i would rush to the nearest rental store to get by any means. But if i saw it was on TV i might flip to it and watch it for a few minutes, then would become bored and find something a little more entertaining. All in all this is not a movie i would want to watch more than once, which is a major contribution in how i rate movies. if it entertains me enough to watch it more than once, i would give it a semi good or good rating, but if don't enjoy it enough to watch it more than once, it automatically becomes a pass in my book.

    This was a strange film, one that I'm not sure I completely understood. The editing was a little "out of control" all on its own. This is a review of four seemingly different careers- An animal trainer for the circus, a topiary gardener, a naked mole rat specialist, and a robot scientist. The film tried to find similarities between these three unique jobs. While this was interesting, informative, and slightly satirical, I did not find this a film that I would race to see again. My lack of total enthusiasm in regards to something like this may be only an individual's preference, so I cannot say I detested this movie, and not to see it.

    This was an interesting film,that would attract the attention of all ages for its bizarreness, and its uniqueness. It doesn't have the normal plot of most movies but contains an interesting unexpected list of characters which all pertain different jobs that are often not recognized and are found rare in the world. This movie will attract the interests and will possibly help and open a new range of career opportunities to the world that most have failed to recognize. These jobs not only take patience but passion, and willingness to go outside the box, rather than sit at work in your small cubicle watching the clock tick till you get off. This movie might create a greater desire in you to want to know more about this random jobs, which have now been introduced to you.

    The foremost thing that can let a documentary work out as a good and interesting one is its subject. And let me just say, I could barely finish watching this documentary! There were several issues I was having with this documentary. The first is the most obvious one, that this documentary is focusing on four unrelated persons and completely different subjects. You could say that they are all connected through their passion for their work but there are millions of people out there with a passion for something. I mean, what makes these guys so special and worthy of featuring them in a documentary? And that brings me to the other problem of that the documentary just doesn't ever manage to get deep or involving with anything. The way it's set up, is that it just lets its subjects talk about their work but it doesn't tell you anything about the person itself, or what drives and motivates him. You were supposed to take all of this out of the way they were talking about their work I suppose but it just didn't worked out too well for me. It might had worked out for me if the different subjects were being a bit more interesting ones. But one involves a gardener, the other a robotics designer and the other a guy who is fascinated by mole rats. The one interesting subject involves a lion tamer but because every different subjects take up about as much screen time as the other, the documentary just doesn't ever find the time or space to let any of them work out as something good and interesting enough. It was really lacking some depth, which was due to the combination of its concepts and the approach to all of it. It actually became a very repetitive documentary after a while, since nothing in it ever felt as if it was progressing and going anywhere interesting or surprising. The style also became repetitive and predictable after a short while. The style actually seemed to be the foremost thing that was supposed to keep this documentary together and provide it with pace and visual splendor (with the help of acclaimed cinematographer Robert Richardson) as well but it really started to work against the documentary after a while. It actually helped to prevent this documentary from ever becoming a well enough focused one. I'm not exaggerating when I'm saying that, about half way through the documentary, I already got fed up with it and lost all interest. I really had a hard time finish watching it and when it finally did, I was glad it was all over with. It's not like I hated watching it but it just was a documentary I got absolutely nothing out of! 5/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    There are so many problems with this so-called documentary I don't know where to begin. For starters, this is really a fake documentary. There is so much stock footage and scenes from an old film strewn throughout, one wonders if the title Morris came up with for this film actually refers to his OWN film and how he made it. He probably shot this very quickly, very cheaply, and is just plain out of control as this story is a big mess. Most of this film is entirely boring, and most of the anecdotes the 4 subjects relate are boring. This film is also filled with scenes that have nothing to do with the story being told and it shows. How Roger Ebert and some other critics could have listed this in their top 10 the year it came out is shocking. One of the biggest problems, is that none of the 4 people being interviewed are very interesting. In truth, they probably could be, or likely have interesting things that could have been related/shown, but they all come off boring... and this is clearly Morris' fault, not the 4 people's. The lion tamer is the more interesting of the bunch, but he still is pretty boring in Morris' hands. What a shame. What a waste of celluloid. I really expected a better film, because I recall some of the critical claim it had gotten 14 or 15 years ago. But now that I finally saw this on one of the movie channels, those critics must have been on drugs. Actually... that might be the way to view this film... if you're high, you might actually like it since it's all over the place with weird, non-linear footage. And then if you fall asleep, you won't miss anything.

    My small survey of documentary types has brought me to this, and what a celebration! This is complex, meaningful cinema that just happens to be a documentary. It is intelligent, complex, deliberate and deeply thought provoking. I think it communicates something that isn't quite right, but the thing is communicated in the most effective way  by folding the idea being explained into the form of the explanation, the film itself. The core of this is the work of Rodney Brooks. He is a celebrated researcher in robotics and now the founder of the most promising company making these things. He is smart, articulate and the things he makes work as advertised. I've encountered him and his work professionally over the last 30 years. He makes machines that walk, and have some cognitive navigation skills. Walking is hard. While there are many research centers working on robotics, there are only two universities working on the underlying theories. MIT is the least shallow of these. Add in the fact that Brooks has manufactured thousands of graduates in his style of thinking, and you may appreciate why he may be one of the most influential thinkers on the planet. The theory here is that instead of thinking about a single brain, it makes sense to think in terms of a society of collaborating miniminds, agents. As a metaphor, bees, ants, termites are usual. And as usual, the metaphor in most quarters is taken too literally. Brooks does not quite do so, but this is the first compromise made by the filmmaker. Making agents systems that have the behavior you want is impossible without some structure in the society. A promising approach is to go deep and restructure logic. Instead, Brooks structures the agents into "subsumptive" layers. This mirrors special purpose roles of termites and molerats in colonies. Okay, here is an idea, an interesting one, and one that is already embedded in the general intellectual economy. Around this, Morris builds a film. Nominally, there are four "geniuses." One is our robotics theorist. We have an obsessive expert in molerats, so we have our metaphor made whole. We have a lion tamer. Now he fits into the idea architecture by explaining how he repeatedly risks his life to figure out and superficially control inscrutable animals. And finally we have a guy who reverses the metaphor; he takes living things with their natural agent system that wants to behave one way, and he forces it to look like larger living things. The resemblance is superficial and fragile. Two of these form the cinematic spine: the circus and the robots. Most of what we see apart from the four individuals themselves is a collage of circus footage and splices from old robot movies. We also have the synthesis of old "circus" movies with robotic influence. Peppered in are the two other guys and their cinematic expression. With the molerats, we have  well film of molerats. With the topiarist, we have some artistically photographed scenes of him working in the garden. The score is important in Morris films; here the composer tries to build subsumptive music, taking themes from movies and other recognizable sources, assigning them to types of clips we see, and subsuming them into a klezmer- inspired circus score where we are the audience. This really is a carefully structured piece of cinema, visually conveying ideas much deeper than one normally allows. The problem is that like the four men we are shown, the approach is still discrete, reductionist. It assumes that great sweeps of life can be logical, explained. We go to the circus and topiary garden to see this narrative. An influential professor treats grad students like so many ants, incrementally evolving "the system." A fellow "explains" the colony, as if observations equals insights. So here is the quandary with film and ideas. Film is about showing. The best ideas are about abstracting away distracting (and often false) appearances. A long form narrative film takes you places where you can invent your insights, with some guidance. A documentary feeds insights, but has to stick more with the "sight" than the "in." Still, the structure here and the ambition! It isn't real, but it does not have to be to warm us. Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.

    As you watch this film, you go through three phases: 1) What the heck is this? 2) Fascination 3) Synthesis - What does it all mean? Here's where I came out after a couple days of reflecting on the last question: These four guys have jobs that are quirky and about as different from one another as they could be. None the less, each man is fully absorbed in what he does and uses his job, over the course of a life time, as a meditation on two questions; Who am I? and What is the nature of the world? By the end, they all come to consistent conclusions about themselves, and because of the way their dialogue and images are interspersed, they blur and seem to merge into one single person. That one person then is absorbed by the world of their own mutual conception. The film is ambitious in undertaking these big questions and I think ultimately successful.

    Four obsessed men explaining their individual interests (wild animal trainer, topiary gardener, naked mole rat expert, robot designer) is how I would describe "Fast, Cheap & Out of Control". The documentary is somewhat redundant and not entirely successful. It might have benefited from a couple more eccentric characters, or perhaps telling a little about the topiary guy's wife for instance. The circus scenes and old black and white movie that strung the stories together was inadequate for maintaining interest through 82 minutes. The film's central theme seemed to be emphasizing the very thin line that separates madness from genius. These very original characters came across as both fascinating and sad. - MERK
