 <sinopse>
  A demonic djinn attempts to grant its owner three wishes, which will allow him to summon his brethren to earth.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  In the beginning of the times, God created life into universe: light gave birth to angels, earth to men and fire to djin, creatures condemned to dwell in the void between the worlds. One who wakes a djin shall be given three wishes. Upon granting the third, an unholy legion of djins are freed through a doorway between the worlds upon the Earth. In 1127 A.D., in Persia, a sorcerer lures and traps a powerful Djinn in the stone of secret fire. In the present days, a drunken crane operator drops the valuable statue of Ahura Mazda over the assistant of Raymond Beaumont on the harbor, and one worker finds the huge and priceless opal red stone where Djin is seized. Alexandra Amberson, who works in an auction house, receives the stone for evaluation and accidentally awakes Djin. The evil creature is released later, charges the stone with people souls and feeds with their fears, while chasing Alexandra to force to make three wishes and unleash the demoniac fiends upon Earth.

    (This a re-watch, I have seen this once before) This movie start of with a bang, I loved the first scene in the movie, very odd and very gross, the effect was really good in those scene. I found plot really well done, I found wish master not too scary, I found him a little too funny to be scary! However I found him more creepy when he had the humans face, he got one hell of a evil face I was shocked with some of tye gore in this movie , wow, I didn't not see that come, Spoiler: (He makes a prison, rip a cop Jaw right of his face, Ouch!) that had to hurt! , really fun to watch! This was a really fun movie, the acting was not too bad in this movie, it's really suited the movie well, effect were nice in this movie. I going to give this movie 7 out of 10,

    Not a bad movie. Craven has his typical moments of horror and unreality, and a wonderful monster who really is a monster in the way he manipulates people. A Djinn is released from an ancient jewel, and starts granting wishes to people who never heard the adage, "Be Careful What you Wish for". Some of those are horror icons Kane Hodder, Tony Todd and Robert Englund. The special effects, just at the beginning of CGI technology, are very effective and the character portrayals are pretty interesting. But what makes this movie work is that Craven manages to deliver the scares with some pretty good timing. Sadly, as we will see, Much like Freddy Krueger, the Wishmaster will eventually find himself in the hands of less talented masters who don't get it.

    In ancient Persia, an evil creature called the Djinn wreaks havoc on a local kingdom before being sealed inside a fire opal. Centuries later, the stone, encased in a statue, is discovered when the statue is broken apart in a loading accident. A young gemologist, Alex, examines the jewel to appraise it. But she unwittingly awakes the Djinn inside. Soon the Djinn is loose on the streets, twisting people's wishes and and killing them so he can steal their souls. Eventually the Djinn disguises himself as an elegant man-about-town, Nathaniel Demarest. In both human & Djinn form, he pursues Alexandra to trick her into making three wishes, to enable his unholy legions to conquer the Earth... Even thought the film is as subtle as a sledgehammer, it's the nearest cinema has had to a new Jason/Freddy/Michael Myers in a very long time. Ignore the Presented by... moniker, it's for status,and get ready for some proper B-movie cheese. Divoff is excellent as the titular character, and chews his lines with glee. ##Kills are inventive, but beyond these two aspects, the film is just you average horror. The inclusion of (at the time) horrors greatest stars, is a little cringe worthy, and the effects are really bad, even for the limited budget. But if you can overlook, these little flaws, it's quite an good spin on the horror genre, with something original, which was lacking at the time of release (hello ironic horror).

    With all the slashers that came after Scream, it's nice to see a gimmicky supernatural monster doing the rounds. Rather than haunting dreams, this guy grants wishes, but uses a number of amusing play on word jokes, to make sure the wishes end in disaster. It's a bit of fun and you can make a game of guessing how the exact words would be interpreted by the Djinn. There's some dodgy CGI which again takes me back to being a teen, and nice practical effects. More for gore than genuine chills, this isn't one to watch to feel scared, just watch it for the entertainment.. Divoff has a lot of fun as the Djinn, and there are plenty of horror icon cameos to spot. A fun evenings viewing.

    Had the djinn asked me for a wish, I would have said 'I wish this film were made better" and he would surely have been stumped. I decided to give this a watch after being pleasantly surprised by the somewhat obscure Devil's Rejects (I gave it 4 out of 5 stars) but alas I was disappointed. The Wishmaster is a film with Wes Craven's name attached to it- so it can't be a complete disaster (and it isn't) but the quality of the horror is downright poor. The wishmaster refers to the arcane djinn who in fact is a baddie in this film. Granting three wishes to people, he ensures that if the guys aren't laconic they are ruined in some or the other way. Another twist in this tale: Djinn got a makeover!! Yeah, he's now stone-faced guy in the present world who says things like 'S**t hit the fan' and 'F*** it!'. Quite updated, indeed. Djinn enters modern world in a gemstone and is released of course. He then torments the unlucky ones till his showdown with the girl who has the gemstone. So we have Mr.Djinn burning, drowning, decapitating, crushing, piercing and cursing (with magic) the guys in a customary fashion- he grants their wish. Girl gets visions about the djinn and is completely disregarded by her b**** sister ('Oh, we'll have to go through therapy for you again!' Ah, the unbreakable bond of sisterhood). Girl keeps getting visions on her investigations and faints, shrieks and possily farts but that's not shown. Uptight, no-nonsense girl confronts the djinn, makes four wishes (bonus for her! Not fair for the others...) and vanquishes the djinn. Yipeee!! I'm being funny because the movie is for most of the time a crash bore. There's not a tingle of fervor nor panic in the air, what's there is clich&eacute;d underacting/non-acting. Yeah, there are actors who are sooooooooo stereotypical, I thought I was watching an advertisement. A few examples: 1) The vagabond old guy 2) The shopkeeper who argues with the vagabond old guy 3) The main lady's bimbo sister and her "That's oKAYYY!" to the djinn at the basketball court (Yeah, I was watching an ad!) 4) The creepy best friend turned boyfriend (At least scream when you see a hideous creature besides you) 5) Everyone in the opening scene Now coming to the two leads. Was I seeing Claire from Modern Family in the film or what? Yeah, you can say this lady is the poor version of Sidney Prescott. Neve Campbell brought a unique confidence in her character, one that does not get too boring but doesn't scream her lungs out either. This lady (Tammy, I suppose) gives contageous headaches to the audiences. The djinn can't outbeat Freddie Krueger, who is far more entertaining (yeah, I used the right word). The entire story goes like "Wish. Kill. Wish. Kill. Wish. Kill..... Finally We meet.... Wish. Wish.. Wish... Kill.Kill..Kill...AAAHHHH....Oh!" That's it . Fortunately, its got a decent climax, with gory deaths and lots of blood. The ending is highly predictable (Don't expect me to gasp), and the last kiss between girl and best friend turned boyfriend OBVIOUS. The Wishmaster would have been a horrendous pile of elephant dung balls had it excluded the last fifteen minutes. With that, its somewhat bearable but ultimately a sloppy work. My rating: 4/10

    "Hackmaster" would've been more clever, but eh. Anyhoo, save this one for the kids. You know how you see a movie when you're a young'un that scares the pants offa you, then you see it years later and think "that was it?" This is one of those. This has "kids" written all over it because it's got a scary dude in it. As far as horror movies go, that's all it's got. The rest is an unintentional joke. A jinn/ genie? Magical wishes? OK OK I admit that could have made a good plot. But it didn't and here's why. This movie is entirely too "real life." It's like "You've Got Mail" with Freddy Kreuger playing a minor role. Whether it be more of the horrific, or just the suspense that terrorizes people in the meantime, a good horror movie needs THAT. Wishmaster going clothes shopping while the saleslady flirts with him? That's not horror. Alexandra getting killer migraines every time the Wishmaster makes a wish real? Yawn. It just doesn't work. It's comical in all it's failure to deliver. It's so BASIC. It's cheap and easy. It's terrifying if you're 6 years old. The characters are BORING. Alexandra is boring. Everyone in her life is boring. Watching the victims pile up is pretty cool, but they're still boring. I doubt anyone roots for Alex to beat the Wishmaster because neither she nor anything in the movie has given you a reason to. But I also can't see how anyone roots for the Wishmaster because HE'S lame too. Evil jinn, yeah right. This guy's a poor imitation of a real villain. He's a joke. I imagine he got pants'ed and got his milk money taken away a lot when he was in grade-school (do jinns go to grade-school?). Everyone that falls victim to him is just as lame as he is and you know they're gonna die and furthermore Wishmaster is doing the world a favor by reducing the lame-o's. Anyways. The Wishmaster is some kind of Disney-gone-bad type of horror flick. Kids will probably like it though (ie be scared). So I wouldn't recommend any people possibly reading this to watch Wishmaster unless you've got kids that want to see a horror movie and then imagine Wishmaster's hiding under the bed so they can keep you up all night. As you can see, it's an all around bad film.

    When i first started watching this movie i wasn't sure if i was going to like it and even considered turning it off. But i'm glad that i didn't. Wes Craven has let me down before, but not this time. I thought that it was kind of hard to get into the story but once i got in i was stuck there. The visual effects were very good considering that the movie is over ten years old. One thing i really liked was the wish master's appearance, because he actually looked kind of scary. As far as being scary, i'd give it a 6 out of 10 on the scary scale. There are a few good scares, the one that really got me is the one on the tennis court. That scare alone proves that whoever did the monster makeup did a terrific job. Another thing that i liked about this movie is that the story is fresh and it's not boring. I also like how the wish master has a dark way to twist up someone's wish. Trust me this movie is definitely worth watching and is almost a must see for true horror fans.

    Let me begin by saying this film is not as bad as it's been made out to be sure it's a gore-fest at points and yes the dialogue is cheesy but surely that is what a B-movie is meant to be? The film has more substance than sequels that seem to spawn in the realm of horror movies. The film concerns a Djinn, Arabic for genie, who escapes from a statue to wreak havoc onto the world. He can sustain a human form if he can give someone 3 wishes. Andrew Divoff is delightfully malicious as the evil Djinn. The main cast give fair performances which can only be expected in a,remember, B-Movie. At times the film tries a bit to hard to please horror fans with various winks to other horror icons, Candyman and Freddy Kruger to name a few (Tony Todd and Robert Englund, respectively). But if you want a half decent horror movie to watch and don't care too much about substance then this film will not disappoint. Conclusion. A fun B-movie and a must for all horror fans. Though it does nothing to forward the genre.

    Robert Kurtzman (the K of KNB EFX) directs this fun horror movie that is, unsurprisingly, full of fantastic special effects for those who love a good bit of inventive gore splashed throughout their movies. It's all about the djinn (played by Andrew Divoff), an evil creature who grants wishes. Sadly, these wishes are almost always rather twisted (e.g. wish for a lot of money and you may find a relative just died and left you a large sum thanks to an insurance policy) and this granter of wishes is a million miles away from the nice "genie in the lamp" image we've been fed over the years. Granting wishes and causing havoc wherever he goes, the djinn is really only biding his time until he gets the one who woke him (Tammy Lauren) to make three wishes, upon the granting of the third wish our world will become ruled by the race of the djinn. Wishmaster works well for a number of reasons. First of all, Andrew Divoff is the kind of genre star that just IS. His fantastic, calm, mocking performance is up there with the best fun performances in horror. Then we have those numerous special effects I mentioned, they really are a joy to behold and all of them are a) highly inventive and b) created with no little skill and workmanship. There's also the fun to be had, quite simply, from the central concept - a pesky genie who will grant wishes but almost never in the way that you want them granted - it's great stuff. To top things off, we get a veritable who's who of horror stars scattered throughout the film. Robert Englund is in there, Kane Hodder has a small role, Angus Scrimm narrates the intro, Reggie Bannister appears, Tony Todd is always easy to spot, Ted Raimi is there and even Tom Savini has a blink-and-you'll-miss-him moment. A decent cast, a fun script and a number of truly entertaining gory moments. And that great central performance from Andrew Divoff. It's horror genre fun, through and through. See this if you like: Wishmaster 2, Faust, The Wisher.

    People have said this movie "sucks". Well let me tell you something this movie did suck, it sucked the oxygen out of the room! For some reason this film charged up me and my roommates to the point of insanity sitting on the edge of our seats going "Nooo don't make a wish, noooo!" Yeah it was good, it did for granting wish's what Jaws did for being in the ocean. It's and old tale i know, bad genie bad wishes, where the thing goes sideways is what happens to these poor bastards. Also this film is literally loaded like a Gatling gun with horror movie icons. Every ten seconds your sitting there someone walks by, ohh there's Kane Hodder, look over there that's Tony Todd makin a bad wish. You would think they knew, but no and to our delight we see some real tasty gore. The movie was more comical then scary which made the horror very nice. See it for yourself and don't skip on the sequel, just remember if your out and a stranger with a coffee cake face asks you to make a wish, do not do it. Unless your mad clever!

    When i first started watching this movie i wasn't sure if i was going to like it and even considered turning it off. But i'm glad that i didn't. Wes Craven has let me down before, but not this time. I thought that it was kind of hard to get into the story but once i got in i was stuck there. The visual effects were very good considering that the movie is over ten years old. One thing i really liked was the wish master's appearance, because he actually looked kind of scary. As far as being scary, i'd give it a 6 out of 10 on the scary scale. There are a few good scares, the one that really got me is the one on the tennis court. That scare alone proves that whoever did the monster makeup did a terrific job. Another thing that i liked about this movie is that the story is fresh and it's not boring. I also like how the wish master has a dark way to twist up someone's wish. Trust me this movie is definitely worth watching and is almost a must see for true horror fans.

    Let me begin by saying this film is not as bad as it's been made out to be sure it's a gore-fest at points and yes the dialogue is cheesy but surely that is what a B-movie is meant to be? The film has more substance than sequels that seem to spawn in the realm of horror movies. The film concerns a Djinn, Arabic for genie, who escapes from a statue to wreak havoc onto the world. He can sustain a human form if he can give someone 3 wishes. Andrew Divoff is delightfully malicious as the evil Djinn. The main cast give fair performances which can only be expected in a,remember, B-Movie. At times the film tries a bit to hard to please horror fans with various winks to other horror icons, Candyman and Freddy Kruger to name a few (Tony Todd and Robert Englund, respectively). But if you want a half decent horror movie to watch and don't care too much about substance then this film will not disappoint. Conclusion. A fun B-movie and a must for all horror fans. Though it does nothing to forward the genre.

    Robert Kurtzman (the K of KNB EFX) directs this fun horror movie that is, unsurprisingly, full of fantastic special effects for those who love a good bit of inventive gore splashed throughout their movies. It's all about the djinn (played by Andrew Divoff), an evil creature who grants wishes. Sadly, these wishes are almost always rather twisted (e.g. wish for a lot of money and you may find a relative just died and left you a large sum thanks to an insurance policy) and this granter of wishes is a million miles away from the nice "genie in the lamp" image we've been fed over the years. Granting wishes and causing havoc wherever he goes, the djinn is really only biding his time until he gets the one who woke him (Tammy Lauren) to make three wishes, upon the granting of the third wish our world will become ruled by the race of the djinn. Wishmaster works well for a number of reasons. First of all, Andrew Divoff is the kind of genre star that just IS. His fantastic, calm, mocking performance is up there with the best fun performances in horror. Then we have those numerous special effects I mentioned, they really are a joy to behold and all of them are a) highly inventive and b) created with no little skill and workmanship. There's also the fun to be had, quite simply, from the central concept - a pesky genie who will grant wishes but almost never in the way that you want them granted - it's great stuff. To top things off, we get a veritable who's who of horror stars scattered throughout the film. Robert Englund is in there, Kane Hodder has a small role, Angus Scrimm narrates the intro, Reggie Bannister appears, Tony Todd is always easy to spot, Ted Raimi is there and even Tom Savini has a blink-and-you'll-miss-him moment. A decent cast, a fun script and a number of truly entertaining gory moments. And that great central performance from Andrew Divoff. It's horror genre fun, through and through. See this if you like: Wishmaster 2, Faust, The Wisher.

    People have said this movie "sucks". Well let me tell you something this movie did suck, it sucked the oxygen out of the room! For some reason this film charged up me and my roommates to the point of insanity sitting on the edge of our seats going "Nooo don't make a wish, noooo!" Yeah it was good, it did for granting wish's what Jaws did for being in the ocean. It's and old tale i know, bad genie bad wishes, where the thing goes sideways is what happens to these poor bastards. Also this film is literally loaded like a Gatling gun with horror movie icons. Every ten seconds your sitting there someone walks by, ohh there's Kane Hodder, look over there that's Tony Todd makin a bad wish. You would think they knew, but no and to our delight we see some real tasty gore. The movie was more comical then scary which made the horror very nice. See it for yourself and don't skip on the sequel, just remember if your out and a stranger with a coffee cake face asks you to make a wish, do not do it. Unless your mad clever!

    (This a re-watch, I have seen this once before) This movie start of with a bang, I loved the first scene in the movie, very odd and very gross, the effect was really good in those scene. I found plot really well done, I found wish master not too scary, I found him a little too funny to be scary! However I found him more creepy when he had the humans face, he got one hell of a evil face I was shocked with some of tye gore in this movie , wow, I didn't not see that come, Spoiler: (He makes a prison, rip a cop Jaw right of his face, Ouch!) that had to hurt! , really fun to watch! This was a really fun movie, the acting was not too bad in this movie, it's really suited the movie well, effect were nice in this movie. I going to give this movie 7 out of 10,

    Not a bad movie. Craven has his typical moments of horror and unreality, and a wonderful monster who really is a monster in the way he manipulates people. A Djinn is released from an ancient jewel, and starts granting wishes to people who never heard the adage, "Be Careful What you Wish for". Some of those are horror icons Kane Hodder, Tony Todd and Robert Englund. The special effects, just at the beginning of CGI technology, are very effective and the character portrayals are pretty interesting. But what makes this movie work is that Craven manages to deliver the scares with some pretty good timing. Sadly, as we will see, Much like Freddy Krueger, the Wishmaster will eventually find himself in the hands of less talented masters who don't get it.

    In ancient Persia, an evil creature called the Djinn wreaks havoc on a local kingdom before being sealed inside a fire opal. Centuries later, the stone, encased in a statue, is discovered when the statue is broken apart in a loading accident. A young gemologist, Alex, examines the jewel to appraise it. But she unwittingly awakes the Djinn inside. Soon the Djinn is loose on the streets, twisting people's wishes and and killing them so he can steal their souls. Eventually the Djinn disguises himself as an elegant man-about-town, Nathaniel Demarest. In both human & Djinn form, he pursues Alexandra to trick her into making three wishes, to enable his unholy legions to conquer the Earth... Even thought the film is as subtle as a sledgehammer, it's the nearest cinema has had to a new Jason/Freddy/Michael Myers in a very long time. Ignore the Presented by... moniker, it's for status,and get ready for some proper B-movie cheese. Divoff is excellent as the titular character, and chews his lines with glee. ##Kills are inventive, but beyond these two aspects, the film is just you average horror. The inclusion of (at the time) horrors greatest stars, is a little cringe worthy, and the effects are really bad, even for the limited budget. But if you can overlook, these little flaws, it's quite an good spin on the horror genre, with something original, which was lacking at the time of release (hello ironic horror).

    With all the slashers that came after Scream, it's nice to see a gimmicky supernatural monster doing the rounds. Rather than haunting dreams, this guy grants wishes, but uses a number of amusing play on word jokes, to make sure the wishes end in disaster. It's a bit of fun and you can make a game of guessing how the exact words would be interpreted by the Djinn. There's some dodgy CGI which again takes me back to being a teen, and nice practical effects. More for gore than genuine chills, this isn't one to watch to feel scared, just watch it for the entertainment.. Divoff has a lot of fun as the Djinn, and there are plenty of horror icon cameos to spot. A fun evenings viewing.

    Had the djinn asked me for a wish, I would have said 'I wish this film were made better" and he would surely have been stumped. I decided to give this a watch after being pleasantly surprised by the somewhat obscure Devil's Rejects (I gave it 4 out of 5 stars) but alas I was disappointed. The Wishmaster is a film with Wes Craven's name attached to it- so it can't be a complete disaster (and it isn't) but the quality of the horror is downright poor. The wishmaster refers to the arcane djinn who in fact is a baddie in this film. Granting three wishes to people, he ensures that if the guys aren't laconic they are ruined in some or the other way. Another twist in this tale: Djinn got a makeover!! Yeah, he's now stone-faced guy in the present world who says things like 'S**t hit the fan' and 'F*** it!'. Quite updated, indeed. Djinn enters modern world in a gemstone and is released of course. He then torments the unlucky ones till his showdown with the girl who has the gemstone. So we have Mr.Djinn burning, drowning, decapitating, crushing, piercing and cursing (with magic) the guys in a customary fashion- he grants their wish. Girl gets visions about the djinn and is completely disregarded by her b**** sister ('Oh, we'll have to go through therapy for you again!' Ah, the unbreakable bond of sisterhood). Girl keeps getting visions on her investigations and faints, shrieks and possily farts but that's not shown. Uptight, no-nonsense girl confronts the djinn, makes four wishes (bonus for her! Not fair for the others...) and vanquishes the djinn. Yipeee!! I'm being funny because the movie is for most of the time a crash bore. There's not a tingle of fervor nor panic in the air, what's there is clich&eacute;d underacting/non-acting. Yeah, there are actors who are sooooooooo stereotypical, I thought I was watching an advertisement. A few examples: 1) The vagabond old guy 2) The shopkeeper who argues with the vagabond old guy 3) The main lady's bimbo sister and her "That's oKAYYY!" to the djinn at the basketball court (Yeah, I was watching an ad!) 4) The creepy best friend turned boyfriend (At least scream when you see a hideous creature besides you) 5) Everyone in the opening scene Now coming to the two leads. Was I seeing Claire from Modern Family in the film or what? Yeah, you can say this lady is the poor version of Sidney Prescott. Neve Campbell brought a unique confidence in her character, one that does not get too boring but doesn't scream her lungs out either. This lady (Tammy, I suppose) gives contageous headaches to the audiences. The djinn can't outbeat Freddie Krueger, who is far more entertaining (yeah, I used the right word). The entire story goes like "Wish. Kill. Wish. Kill. Wish. Kill..... Finally We meet.... Wish. Wish.. Wish... Kill.Kill..Kill...AAAHHHH....Oh!" That's it . Fortunately, its got a decent climax, with gory deaths and lots of blood. The ending is highly predictable (Don't expect me to gasp), and the last kiss between girl and best friend turned boyfriend OBVIOUS. The Wishmaster would have been a horrendous pile of elephant dung balls had it excluded the last fifteen minutes. With that, its somewhat bearable but ultimately a sloppy work. My rating: 4/10

    "Hackmaster" would've been more clever, but eh. Anyhoo, save this one for the kids. You know how you see a movie when you're a young'un that scares the pants offa you, then you see it years later and think "that was it?" This is one of those. This has "kids" written all over it because it's got a scary dude in it. As far as horror movies go, that's all it's got. The rest is an unintentional joke. A jinn/ genie? Magical wishes? OK OK I admit that could have made a good plot. But it didn't and here's why. This movie is entirely too "real life." It's like "You've Got Mail" with Freddy Kreuger playing a minor role. Whether it be more of the horrific, or just the suspense that terrorizes people in the meantime, a good horror movie needs THAT. Wishmaster going clothes shopping while the saleslady flirts with him? That's not horror. Alexandra getting killer migraines every time the Wishmaster makes a wish real? Yawn. It just doesn't work. It's comical in all it's failure to deliver. It's so BASIC. It's cheap and easy. It's terrifying if you're 6 years old. The characters are BORING. Alexandra is boring. Everyone in her life is boring. Watching the victims pile up is pretty cool, but they're still boring. I doubt anyone roots for Alex to beat the Wishmaster because neither she nor anything in the movie has given you a reason to. But I also can't see how anyone roots for the Wishmaster because HE'S lame too. Evil jinn, yeah right. This guy's a poor imitation of a real villain. He's a joke. I imagine he got pants'ed and got his milk money taken away a lot when he was in grade-school (do jinns go to grade-school?). Everyone that falls victim to him is just as lame as he is and you know they're gonna die and furthermore Wishmaster is doing the world a favor by reducing the lame-o's. Anyways. The Wishmaster is some kind of Disney-gone-bad type of horror flick. Kids will probably like it though (ie be scared). So I wouldn't recommend any people possibly reading this to watch Wishmaster unless you've got kids that want to see a horror movie and then imagine Wishmaster's hiding under the bed so they can keep you up all night. As you can see, it's an all around bad film.

Was I seeing Claire from Modern Family in the film or what? Yeah, you can say this lady is the poor version of Sidney Prescott. Neve Campbell brought a unique confidence in her character, one that does not get too boring but doesn't scream her lungs out either. This lady (Tammy, I suppose) gives contageous headaches to the audiences. The djinn can't outbeat Freddie Krueger, who is far more entertaining (yeah, I used the right word). The entire story goes like "Wish. Kill. Wish. Kill. Wish. Kill..... Finally We meet.... Wish. Wish.. Wish... Kill.Kill..Kill...AAAHHHH....Oh!" That's it . Fortunately, its got a decent climax, with gory deaths and lots of blood. The ending is highly predictable (Don't expect me to gasp), and the last kiss between girl and best friend turned boyfriend OBVIOUS. The Wishmaster would have been a horrendous pile of elephant dung balls had it excluded the last fifteen minutes. With that, its somewhat bearable but ultimately a sloppy work. My rating: 4/10

    "Hackmaster" would've been more clever, but eh. Anyhoo, save this one for the kids. You know how you see a movie when you're a young'un that scares the pants offa you, then you see it years later and think "that was it?" This is one of those. This has "kids" written all over it because it's got a scary dude in it. As far as horror movies go, that's all it's got. The rest is an unintentional joke. A jinn/ genie? Magical wishes? OK OK I admit that could have made a good plot. But it didn't and here's why. This movie is entirely too "real life." It's like "You've Got Mail" with Freddy Kreuger playing a minor role. Whether it be more of the horrific, or just the suspense that terrorizes people in the meantime, a good horror movie needs THAT. Wishmaster going clothes shopping while the saleslady flirts with him? That's not horror. Alexandra getting killer migraines every time the Wishmaster makes a wish real? Yawn. It just doesn't work. It's comical in all it's failure to deliver. It's so BASIC. It's cheap and easy. It's terrifying if you're 6 years old. The characters are BORING. Alexandra is boring. Everyone in her life is boring. Watching the victims pile up is pretty cool, but they're still boring. I doubt anyone roots for Alex to beat the Wishmaster because neither she nor anything in the movie has given you a reason to. But I also can't see how anyone roots for the Wishmaster because HE'S lame too. Evil jinn, yeah right. This guy's a poor imitation of a real villain. He's a joke. I imagine he got pants'ed and got his milk money taken away a lot when he was in grade-school (do jinns go to grade-school?). Everyone that falls victim to him is just as lame as he is and you know they're gonna die and furthermore Wishmaster is doing the world a favor by reducing the lame-o's. Anyways. The Wishmaster is some kind of Disney-gone-bad type of horror flick. Kids will probably like it though (ie be scared). So I wouldn't recommend any people possibly reading this to watch Wishmaster unless you've got kids that want to see a horror movie and then imagine Wishmaster's hiding under the bed so they can keep you up all night. As you can see, it's an all around bad film.

    When i first started watching this movie i wasn't sure if i was going to like it and even considered turning it off. But i'm glad that i didn't. Wes Craven has let me down before, but not this time. I thought that it was kind of hard to get into the story but once i got in i was stuck there. The visual effects were very good considering that the movie is over ten years old. One thing i really liked was the wish master's appearance, because he actually looked kind of scary. As far as being scary, i'd give it a 6 out of 10 on the scary scale. There are a few good scares, the one that really got me is the one on the tennis court. That scare alone proves that whoever did the monster makeup did a terrific job. Another thing that i liked about this movie is that the story is fresh and it's not boring. I also like how the wish master has a dark way to twist up someone's wish. Trust me this movie is definitely worth watching and is almost a must see for true horror fans.

    Let me begin by saying this film is not as bad as it's been made out to be sure it's a gore-fest at points and yes the dialogue is cheesy but surely that is what a B-movie is meant to be? The film has more substance than sequels that seem to spawn in the realm of horror movies. The film concerns a Djinn, Arabic for genie, who escapes from a statue to wreak havoc onto the world. He can sustain a human form if he can give someone 3 wishes. Andrew Divoff is delightfully malicious as the evil Djinn. The main cast give fair performances which can only be expected in a,remember, B-Movie. At times the film tries a bit to hard to please horror fans with various winks to other horror icons, Candyman and Freddy Kruger to name a few (Tony Todd and Robert Englund, respectively). But if you want a half decent horror movie to watch and don't care too much about substance then this film will not disappoint. Conclusion. A fun B-movie and a must for all horror fans. Though it does nothing to forward the genre.

    Robert Kurtzman (the K of KNB EFX) directs this fun horror movie that is, unsurprisingly, full of fantastic special effects for those who love a good bit of inventive gore splashed throughout their movies. It's all about the djinn (played by Andrew Divoff), an evil creature who grants wishes. Sadly, these wishes are almost always rather twisted (e.g. wish for a lot of money and you may find a relative just died and left you a large sum thanks to an insurance policy) and this granter of wishes is a million miles away from the nice "genie in the lamp" image we've been fed over the years. Granting wishes and causing havoc wherever he goes, the djinn is really only biding his time until he gets the one who woke him (Tammy Lauren) to make three wishes, upon the granting of the third wish our world will become ruled by the race of the djinn. Wishmaster works well for a number of reasons. First of all, Andrew Divoff is the kind of genre star that just IS. His fantastic, calm, mocking performance is up there with the best fun performances in horror. Then we have those numerous special effects I mentioned, they really are a joy to behold and all of them are a) highly inventive and b) created with no little skill and workmanship. There's also the fun to be had, quite simply, from the central concept - a pesky genie who will grant wishes but almost never in the way that you want them granted - it's great stuff. To top things off, we get a veritable who's who of horror stars scattered throughout the film. Robert Englund is in there, Kane Hodder has a small role, Angus Scrimm narrates the intro, Reggie Bannister appears, Tony Todd is always easy to spot, Ted Raimi is there and even Tom Savini has a blink-and-you'll-miss-him moment. A decent cast, a fun script and a number of truly entertaining gory moments. And that great central performance from Andrew Divoff. It's horror genre fun, through and through. See this if you like: Wishmaster 2, Faust, The Wisher.

    People have said this movie "sucks". Well let me tell you something this movie did suck, it sucked the oxygen out of the room! For some reason this film charged up me and my roommates to the point of insanity sitting on the edge of our seats going "Nooo don't make a wish, noooo!" Yeah it was good, it did for granting wish's what Jaws did for being in the ocean. It's and old tale i know, bad genie bad wishes, where the thing goes sideways is what happens to these poor bastards. Also this film is literally loaded like a Gatling gun with horror movie icons. Every ten seconds your sitting there someone walks by, ohh there's Kane Hodder, look over there that's Tony Todd makin a bad wish. You would think they knew, but no and to our delight we see some real tasty gore. The movie was more comical then scary which made the horror very nice. See it for yourself and don't skip on the sequel, just remember if your out and a stranger with a coffee cake face asks you to make a wish, do not do it. Unless your mad clever!

I found plot really well done, I found wish master not too scary, I found him a little too funny to be scary! However I found him more creepy when he had the humans face, he got one hell of a evil face I was shocked with some of tye gore in this movie , wow, I didn't not see that come, Spoiler: (He makes a prison, rip a cop Jaw right of his face, Ouch!) that had to hurt! , really fun to watch! This was a really fun movie, the acting was not too bad in this movie, it's really suited the movie well, effect were nice in this movie. I going to give this movie 7 out of 10,

    Not a bad movie. Craven has his typical moments of horror and unreality, and a wonderful monster who really is a monster in the way he manipulates people. A Djinn is released from an ancient jewel, and starts granting wishes to people who never heard the adage, "Be Careful What you Wish for". Some of those are horror icons Kane Hodder, Tony Todd and Robert Englund. The special effects, just at the beginning of CGI technology, are very effective and the character portrayals are pretty interesting. But what makes this movie work is that Craven manages to deliver the scares with some pretty good timing. Sadly, as we will see, Much like Freddy Krueger, the Wishmaster will eventually find himself in the hands of less talented masters who don't get it.

    In ancient Persia, an evil creature called the Djinn wreaks havoc on a local kingdom before being sealed inside a fire opal. Centuries later, the stone, encased in a statue, is discovered when the statue is broken apart in a loading accident. A young gemologist, Alex, examines the jewel to appraise it. But she unwittingly awakes the Djinn inside. Soon the Djinn is loose on the streets, twisting people's wishes and and killing them so he can steal their souls. Eventually the Djinn disguises himself as an elegant man-about-town, Nathaniel Demarest. In both human & Djinn form, he pursues Alexandra to trick her into making three wishes, to enable his unholy legions to conquer the Earth... Even thought the film is as subtle as a sledgehammer, it's the nearest cinema has had to a new Jason/Freddy/Michael Myers in a very long time. Ignore the Presented by... moniker, it's for status,and get ready for some proper B-movie cheese. Divoff is excellent as the titular character, and chews his lines with glee. ##Kills are inventive, but beyond these two aspects, the film is just you average horror. The inclusion of (at the time) horrors greatest stars, is a little cringe worthy, and the effects are really bad, even for the limited budget. But if you can overlook, these little flaws, it's quite an good spin on the horror genre, with something original, which was lacking at the time of release (hello ironic horror).

    With all the slashers that came after Scream, it's nice to see a gimmicky supernatural monster doing the rounds. Rather than haunting dreams, this guy grants wishes, but uses a number of amusing play on word jokes, to make sure the wishes end in disaster. It's a bit of fun and you can make a game of guessing how the exact words would be interpreted by the Djinn. There's some dodgy CGI which again takes me back to being a teen, and nice practical effects. More for gore than genuine chills, this isn't one to watch to feel scared, just watch it for the entertainment.. Divoff has a lot of fun as the Djinn, and there are plenty of horror icon cameos to spot. A fun evenings viewing.

    Had the djinn asked me for a wish, I would have said 'I wish this film were made better" and he would surely have been stumped. I decided to give this a watch after being pleasantly surprised by the somewhat obscure Devil's Rejects (I gave it 4 out of 5 stars) but alas I was disappointed. The Wishmaster is a film with Wes Craven's name attached to it- so it can't be a complete disaster (and it isn't) but the quality of the horror is downright poor. The wishmaster refers to the arcane djinn who in fact is a baddie in this film. Granting three wishes to people, he ensures that if the guys aren't laconic they are ruined in some or the other way. Another twist in this tale: Djinn got a makeover!! Yeah, he's now stone-faced guy in the present world who says things like 'S**t hit the fan' and 'F*** it!'. Quite updated, indeed. Djinn enters modern world in a gemstone and is released of course. He then torments the unlucky ones till his showdown with the girl who has the gemstone. So we have Mr.Djinn burning, drowning, decapitating, crushing, piercing and cursing (with magic) the guys in a customary fashion- he grants their wish. Girl gets visions about the djinn and is completely disregarded by her b**** sister ('Oh, we'll have to go through therapy for you again!' Ah, the unbreakable bond of sisterhood). Girl keeps getting visions on her investigations and faints, shrieks and possily farts but that's not shown. Uptight, no-nonsense girl confronts the djinn, makes four wishes (bonus for her! Not fair for the others...) and vanquishes the djinn. Yipeee!! I'm being funny because the movie is for most of the time a crash bore. There's not a tingle of fervor nor panic in the air, what's there is clich&eacute;d underacting/non-acting. Yeah, there are actors who are sooooooooo stereotypical, I thought I was watching an advertisement. A few examples: 1) The vagabond old guy 2) The shopkeeper who argues with the vagabond old guy 3) The main lady's bimbo sister and her "That's oKAYYY!" to the djinn at the basketball court (Yeah, I was watching an ad!) 4) The creepy best friend turned boyfriend (At least scream when you see a hideous creature besides you) 5) Everyone in the opening scene Now coming to the two leads. Was I seeing Claire from Modern Family in the film or what? Yeah, you can say this lady is the poor version of Sidney Prescott. Neve Campbell brought a unique confidence in her character, one that does not get too boring but doesn't scream her lungs out either. This lady (Tammy, I suppose) gives contageous headaches to the audiences. The djinn can't outbeat Freddie Krueger, who is far more entertaining (yeah, I used the right word). The entire story goes like "Wish. Kill. Wish. Kill. Wish. Kill..... Finally We meet.... Wish. Wish.. Wish... Kill.Kill..Kill...AAAHHHH....Oh!" That's it . Fortunately, its got a decent climax, with gory deaths and lots of blood. The ending is highly predictable (Don't expect me to gasp), and the last kiss between girl and best friend turned boyfriend OBVIOUS. The Wishmaster would have been a horrendous pile of elephant dung balls had it excluded the last fifteen minutes. With that, its somewhat bearable but ultimately a sloppy work. My rating: 4/10

Divoff is excellent as the titular character, and chews his lines with glee. ##Kills are inventive, but beyond these two aspects, the film is just you average horror. The inclusion of (at the time) horrors greatest stars, is a little cringe worthy, and the effects are really bad, even for the limited budget. But if you can overlook, these little flaws, it's quite an good spin on the horror genre, with something original, which was lacking at the time of release (hello ironic horror).

    With all the slashers that came after Scream, it's nice to see a gimmicky supernatural monster doing the rounds. Rather than haunting dreams, this guy grants wishes, but uses a number of amusing play on word jokes, to make sure the wishes end in disaster. It's a bit of fun and you can make a game of guessing how the exact words would be interpreted by the Djinn. There's some dodgy CGI which again takes me back to being a teen, and nice practical effects. More for gore than genuine chills, this isn't one to watch to feel scared, just watch it for the entertainment.. Divoff has a lot of fun as the Djinn, and there are plenty of horror icon cameos to spot. A fun evenings viewing.

    Had the djinn asked me for a wish, I would have said 'I wish this film were made better" and he would surely have been stumped. I decided to give this a watch after being pleasantly surprised by the somewhat obscure Devil's Rejects (I gave it 4 out of 5 stars) but alas I was disappointed. The Wishmaster is a film with Wes Craven's name attached to it- so it can't be a complete disaster (and it isn't) but the quality of the horror is downright poor. The wishmaster refers to the arcane djinn who in fact is a baddie in this film. Granting three wishes to people, he ensures that if the guys aren't laconic they are ruined in some or the other way. Another twist in this tale: Djinn got a makeover!! Yeah, he's now stone-faced guy in the present world who says things like 'S**t hit the fan' and 'F*** it!'. Quite updated, indeed. Djinn enters modern world in a gemstone and is released of course. He then torments the unlucky ones till his showdown with the girl who has the gemstone. So we have Mr.Djinn burning, drowning, decapitating, crushing, piercing and cursing (with magic) the guys in a customary fashion- he grants their wish. Girl gets visions about the djinn and is completely disregarded by her b**** sister ('Oh, we'll have to go through therapy for you again!' Ah, the unbreakable bond of sisterhood). Girl keeps getting visions on her investigations and faints, shrieks and possily farts but that's not shown. Uptight, no-nonsense girl confronts the djinn, makes four wishes (bonus for her! Not fair for the others...) and vanquishes the djinn. Yipeee!! I'm being funny because the movie is for most of the time a crash bore. There's not a tingle of fervor nor panic in the air, what's there is clich&eacute;d underacting/non-acting. Yeah, there are actors who are sooooooooo stereotypical, I thought I was watching an advertisement. A few examples: 1) The vagabond old guy 2) The shopkeeper who argues with the vagabond old guy 3) The main lady's bimbo sister and her "That's oKAYYY!" to the djinn at the basketball court (Yeah, I was watching an ad!) 4) The creepy best friend turned boyfriend (At least scream when you see a hideous creature besides you) 5) Everyone in the opening scene Now coming to the two leads. Was I seeing Claire from Modern Family in the film or what? Yeah, you can say this lady is the poor version of Sidney Prescott. Neve Campbell brought a unique confidence in her character, one that does not get too boring but doesn't scream her lungs out either. This lady (Tammy, I suppose) gives contageous headaches to the audiences. The djinn can't outbeat Freddie Krueger, who is far more entertaining (yeah, I used the right word). The entire story goes like "Wish. Kill. Wish. Kill. Wish. Kill..... Finally We meet.... Wish. Wish.. Wish... Kill.Kill..Kill...AAAHHHH....Oh!" That's it . Fortunately, its got a decent climax, with gory deaths and lots of blood. The ending is highly predictable (Don't expect me to gasp), and the last kiss between girl and best friend turned boyfriend OBVIOUS. The Wishmaster would have been a horrendous pile of elephant dung balls had it excluded the last fifteen minutes. With that, its somewhat bearable but ultimately a sloppy work. My rating: 4/10

    "Hackmaster" would've been more clever, but eh. Anyhoo, save this one for the kids. You know how you see a movie when you're a young'un that scares the pants offa you, then you see it years later and think "that was it?" This is one of those. This has "kids" written all over it because it's got a scary dude in it. As far as horror movies go, that's all it's got. The rest is an unintentional joke. A jinn/ genie? Magical wishes? OK OK I admit that could have made a good plot. But it didn't and here's why. This movie is entirely too "real life." It's like "You've Got Mail" with Freddy Kreuger playing a minor role. Whether it be more of the horrific, or just the suspense that terrorizes people in the meantime, a good horror movie needs THAT. Wishmaster going clothes shopping while the saleslady flirts with him? That's not horror. Alexandra getting killer migraines every time the Wishmaster makes a wish real? Yawn. It just doesn't work. It's comical in all it's failure to deliver. It's so BASIC. It's cheap and easy. It's terrifying if you're 6 years old. The characters are BORING. Alexandra is boring. Everyone in her life is boring. Watching the victims pile up is pretty cool, but they're still boring. I doubt anyone roots for Alex to beat the Wishmaster because neither she nor anything in the movie has given you a reason to. But I also can't see how anyone roots for the Wishmaster because HE'S lame too. Evil jinn, yeah right. This guy's a poor imitation of a real villain. He's a joke. I imagine he got pants'ed and got his milk money taken away a lot when he was in grade-school (do jinns go to grade-school?). Everyone that falls victim to him is just as lame as he is and you know they're gonna die and furthermore Wishmaster is doing the world a favor by reducing the lame-o's. Anyways. The Wishmaster is some kind of Disney-gone-bad type of horror flick. Kids will probably like it though (ie be scared). So I wouldn't recommend any people possibly reading this to watch Wishmaster unless you've got kids that want to see a horror movie and then imagine Wishmaster's hiding under the bed so they can keep you up all night. As you can see, it's an all around bad film.

    When i first started watching this movie i wasn't sure if i was going to like it and even considered turning it off. But i'm glad that i didn't. Wes Craven has let me down before, but not this time. I thought that it was kind of hard to get into the story but once i got in i was stuck there. The visual effects were very good considering that the movie is over ten years old. One thing i really liked was the wish master's appearance, because he actually looked kind of scary. As far as being scary, i'd give it a 6 out of 10 on the scary scale. There are a few good scares, the one that really got me is the one on the tennis court. That scare alone proves that whoever did the monster makeup did a terrific job. Another thing that i liked about this movie is that the story is fresh and it's not boring. I also like how the wish master has a dark way to twist up someone's wish. Trust me this movie is definitely worth watching and is almost a must see for true horror fans.

    Let me begin by saying this film is not as bad as it's been made out to be sure it's a gore-fest at points and yes the dialogue is cheesy but surely that is what a B-movie is meant to be? The film has more substance than sequels that seem to spawn in the realm of horror movies. The film concerns a Djinn, Arabic for genie, who escapes from a statue to wreak havoc onto the world. He can sustain a human form if he can give someone 3 wishes. Andrew Divoff is delightfully malicious as the evil Djinn. The main cast give fair performances which can only be expected in a,remember, B-Movie. At times the film tries a bit to hard to please horror fans with various winks to other horror icons, Candyman and Freddy Kruger to name a few (Tony Todd and Robert Englund, respectively). But if you want a half decent horror movie to watch and don't care too much about substance then this film will not disappoint. Conclusion. A fun B-movie and a must for all horror fans. Though it does nothing to forward the genre.

    Robert Kurtzman (the K of KNB EFX) directs this fun horror movie that is, unsurprisingly, full of fantastic special effects for those who love a good bit of inventive gore splashed throughout their movies. It's all about the djinn (played by Andrew Divoff), an evil creature who grants wishes. Sadly, these wishes are almost always rather twisted (e.g. wish for a lot of money and you may find a relative just died and left you a large sum thanks to an insurance policy) and this granter of wishes is a million miles away from the nice "genie in the lamp" image we've been fed over the years. Granting wishes and causing havoc wherever he goes, the djinn is really only biding his time until he gets the one who woke him (Tammy Lauren) to make three wishes, upon the granting of the third wish our world will become ruled by the race of the djinn. Wishmaster works well for a number of reasons. First of all, Andrew Divoff is the kind of genre star that just IS. His fantastic, calm, mocking performance is up there with the best fun performances in horror. Then we have those numerous special effects I mentioned, they really are a joy to behold and all of them are a) highly inventive and b) created with no little skill and workmanship. There's also the fun to be had, quite simply, from the central concept - a pesky genie who will grant wishes but almost never in the way that you want them granted - it's great stuff. To top things off, we get a veritable who's who of horror stars scattered throughout the film. Robert Englund is in there, Kane Hodder has a small role, Angus Scrimm narrates the intro, Reggie Bannister appears, Tony Todd is always easy to spot, Ted Raimi is there and even Tom Savini has a blink-and-you'll-miss-him moment. A decent cast, a fun script and a number of truly entertaining gory moments. And that great central performance from Andrew Divoff. It's horror genre fun, through and through. See this if you like: Wishmaster 2, Faust, The Wisher.

    People have said this movie "sucks". Well let me tell you something this movie did suck, it sucked the oxygen out of the room! For some reason this film charged up me and my roommates to the point of insanity sitting on the edge of our seats going "Nooo don't make a wish, noooo!" Yeah it was good, it did for granting wish's what Jaws did for being in the ocean. It's and old tale i know, bad genie bad wishes, where the thing goes sideways is what happens to these poor bastards. Also this film is literally loaded like a Gatling gun with horror movie icons. Every ten seconds your sitting there someone walks by, ohh there's Kane Hodder, look over there that's Tony Todd makin a bad wish. You would think they knew, but no and to our delight we see some real tasty gore. The movie was more comical then scary which made the horror very nice. See it for yourself and don't skip on the sequel, just remember if your out and a stranger with a coffee cake face asks you to make a wish, do not do it. Unless your mad clever!

    (This a re-watch, I have seen this once before) This movie start of with a bang, I loved the first scene in the movie, very odd and very gross, the effect was really good in those scene. I found plot really well done, I found wish master not too scary, I found him a little too funny to be scary! However I found him more creepy when he had the humans face, he got one hell of a evil face I was shocked with some of tye gore in this movie , wow, I didn't not see that come, Spoiler: (He makes a prison, rip a cop Jaw right of his face, Ouch!) that had to hurt! , really fun to watch! This was a really fun movie, the acting was not too bad in this movie, it's really suited the movie well, effect were nice in this movie. I going to give this movie 7 out of 10,

    Not a bad movie. Craven has his typical moments of horror and unreality, and a wonderful monster who really is a monster in the way he manipulates people. A Djinn is released from an ancient jewel, and starts granting wishes to people who never heard the adage, "Be Careful What you Wish for". Some of those are horror icons Kane Hodder, Tony Todd and Robert Englund. The special effects, just at the beginning of CGI technology, are very effective and the character portrayals are pretty interesting. But what makes this movie work is that Craven manages to deliver the scares with some pretty good timing. Sadly, as we will see, Much like Freddy Krueger, the Wishmaster will eventually find himself in the hands of less talented masters who don't get it.

    In ancient Persia, an evil creature called the Djinn wreaks havoc on a local kingdom before being sealed inside a fire opal. Centuries later, the stone, encased in a statue, is discovered when the statue is broken apart in a loading accident. A young gemologist, Alex, examines the jewel to appraise it. But she unwittingly awakes the Djinn inside. Soon the Djinn is loose on the streets, twisting people's wishes and and killing them so he can steal their souls. Eventually the Djinn disguises himself as an elegant man-about-town, Nathaniel Demarest. In both human & Djinn form, he pursues Alexandra to trick her into making three wishes, to enable his unholy legions to conquer the Earth... Even thought the film is as subtle as a sledgehammer, it's the nearest cinema has had to a new Jason/Freddy/Michael Myers in a very long time. Ignore the Presented by... moniker, it's for status,and get ready for some proper B-movie cheese. Divoff is excellent as the titular character, and chews his lines with glee. ##Kills are inventive, but beyond these two aspects, the film is just you average horror. The inclusion of (at the time) horrors greatest stars, is a little cringe worthy, and the effects are really bad, even for the limited budget. But if you can overlook, these little flaws, it's quite an good spin on the horror genre, with something original, which was lacking at the time of release (hello ironic horror).

Every ten seconds your sitting there someone walks by, ohh there's Kane Hodder, look over there that's Tony Todd makin a bad wish. You would think they knew, but no and to our delight we see some real tasty gore. The movie was more comical then scary which made the horror very nice. See it for yourself and don't skip on the sequel, just remember if your out and a stranger with a coffee cake face asks you to make a wish, do not do it. Unless your mad clever!

    (This a re-watch, I have seen this once before) This movie start of with a bang, I loved the first scene in the movie, very odd and very gross, the effect was really good in those scene. I found plot really well done, I found wish master not too scary, I found him a little too funny to be scary! However I found him more creepy when he had the humans face, he got one hell of a evil face I was shocked with some of tye gore in this movie , wow, I didn't not see that come, Spoiler: (He makes a prison, rip a cop Jaw right of his face, Ouch!) that had to hurt! , really fun to watch! This was a really fun movie, the acting was not too bad in this movie, it's really suited the movie well, effect were nice in this movie. I going to give this movie 7 out of 10,

    Not a bad movie. Craven has his typical moments of horror and unreality, and a wonderful monster who really is a monster in the way he manipulates people. A Djinn is released from an ancient jewel, and starts granting wishes to people who never heard the adage, "Be Careful What you Wish for". Some of those are horror icons Kane Hodder, Tony Todd and Robert Englund. The special effects, just at the beginning of CGI technology, are very effective and the character portrayals are pretty interesting. But what makes this movie work is that Craven manages to deliver the scares with some pretty good timing. Sadly, as we will see, Much like Freddy Krueger, the Wishmaster will eventually find himself in the hands of less talented masters who don't get it.

    In ancient Persia, an evil creature called the Djinn wreaks havoc on a local kingdom before being sealed inside a fire opal. Centuries later, the stone, encased in a statue, is discovered when the statue is broken apart in a loading accident. A young gemologist, Alex, examines the jewel to appraise it. But she unwittingly awakes the Djinn inside. Soon the Djinn is loose on the streets, twisting people's wishes and and killing them so he can steal their souls. Eventually the Djinn disguises himself as an elegant man-about-town, Nathaniel Demarest. In both human & Djinn form, he pursues Alexandra to trick her into making three wishes, to enable his unholy legions to conquer the Earth... Even thought the film is as subtle as a sledgehammer, it's the nearest cinema has had to a new Jason/Freddy/Michael Myers in a very long time. Ignore the Presented by... moniker, it's for status,and get ready for some proper B-movie cheese. Divoff is excellent as the titular character, and chews his lines with glee. ##Kills are inventive, but beyond these two aspects, the film is just you average horror. The inclusion of (at the time) horrors greatest stars, is a little cringe worthy, and the effects are really bad, even for the limited budget. But if you can overlook, these little flaws, it's quite an good spin on the horror genre, with something original, which was lacking at the time of release (hello ironic horror).

    With all the slashers that came after Scream, it's nice to see a gimmicky supernatural monster doing the rounds. Rather than haunting dreams, this guy grants wishes, but uses a number of amusing play on word jokes, to make sure the wishes end in disaster. It's a bit of fun and you can make a game of guessing how the exact words would be interpreted by the Djinn. There's some dodgy CGI which again takes me back to being a teen, and nice practical effects. More for gore than genuine chills, this isn't one to watch to feel scared, just watch it for the entertainment.. Divoff has a lot of fun as the Djinn, and there are plenty of horror icon cameos to spot. A fun evenings viewing.

    Had the djinn asked me for a wish, I would have said 'I wish this film were made better" and he would surely have been stumped. I decided to give this a watch after being pleasantly surprised by the somewhat obscure Devil's Rejects (I gave it 4 out of 5 stars) but alas I was disappointed. The Wishmaster is a film with Wes Craven's name attached to it- so it can't be a complete disaster (and it isn't) but the quality of the horror is downright poor. The wishmaster refers to the arcane djinn who in fact is a baddie in this film. Granting three wishes to people, he ensures that if the guys aren't laconic they are ruined in some or the other way. Another twist in this tale: Djinn got a makeover!! Yeah, he's now stone-faced guy in the present world who says things like 'S**t hit the fan' and 'F*** it!'. Quite updated, indeed. Djinn enters modern world in a gemstone and is released of course. He then torments the unlucky ones till his showdown with the girl who has the gemstone. So we have Mr.Djinn burning, drowning, decapitating, crushing, piercing and cursing (with magic) the guys in a customary fashion- he grants their wish. Girl gets visions about the djinn and is completely disregarded by her b**** sister ('Oh, we'll have to go through therapy for you again!' Ah, the unbreakable bond of sisterhood). Girl keeps getting visions on her investigations and faints, shrieks and possily farts but that's not shown. Uptight, no-nonsense girl confronts the djinn, makes four wishes (bonus for her! Not fair for the others...) and vanquishes the djinn. Yipeee!! I'm being funny because the movie is for most of the time a crash bore. There's not a tingle of fervor nor panic in the air, what's there is clich&eacute;d underacting/non-acting. Yeah, there are actors who are sooooooooo stereotypical, I thought I was watching an advertisement. A few examples: 1) The vagabond old guy 2) The shopkeeper who argues with the vagabond old guy 3) The main lady's bimbo sister and her "That's oKAYYY!" to the djinn at the basketball court (Yeah, I was watching an ad!) 4) The creepy best friend turned boyfriend (At least scream when you see a hideous creature besides you) 5) Everyone in the opening scene Now coming to the two leads. Was I seeing Claire from Modern Family in the film or what? Yeah, you can say this lady is the poor version of Sidney Prescott. Neve Campbell brought a unique confidence in her character, one that does not get too boring but doesn't scream her lungs out either. This lady (Tammy, I suppose) gives contageous headaches to the audiences. The djinn can't outbeat Freddie Krueger, who is far more entertaining (yeah, I used the right word). The entire story goes like "Wish. Kill. Wish. Kill. Wish. Kill..... Finally We meet.... Wish. Wish.. Wish... Kill.Kill..Kill...AAAHHHH....Oh!" That's it . Fortunately, its got a decent climax, with gory deaths and lots of blood. The ending is highly predictable (Don't expect me to gasp), and the last kiss between girl and best friend turned boyfriend OBVIOUS. The Wishmaster would have been a horrendous pile of elephant dung balls had it excluded the last fifteen minutes. With that, its somewhat bearable but ultimately a sloppy work. My rating: 4/10

    "Hackmaster" would've been more clever, but eh. Anyhoo, save this one for the kids. You know how you see a movie when you're a young'un that scares the pants offa you, then you see it years later and think "that was it?" This is one of those. This has "kids" written all over it because it's got a scary dude in it. As far as horror movies go, that's all it's got. The rest is an unintentional joke. A jinn/ genie? Magical wishes? OK OK I admit that could have made a good plot. But it didn't and here's why. This movie is entirely too "real life." It's like "You've Got Mail" with Freddy Kreuger playing a minor role. Whether it be more of the horrific, or just the suspense that terrorizes people in the meantime, a good horror movie needs THAT. Wishmaster going clothes shopping while the saleslady flirts with him? That's not horror. Alexandra getting killer migraines every time the Wishmaster makes a wish real? Yawn. It just doesn't work. It's comical in all it's failure to deliver. It's so BASIC. It's cheap and easy. It's terrifying if you're 6 years old. The characters are BORING. Alexandra is boring. Everyone in her life is boring. Watching the victims pile up is pretty cool, but they're still boring. I doubt anyone roots for Alex to beat the Wishmaster because neither she nor anything in the movie has given you a reason to. But I also can't see how anyone roots for the Wishmaster because HE'S lame too. Evil jinn, yeah right. This guy's a poor imitation of a real villain. He's a joke. I imagine he got pants'ed and got his milk money taken away a lot when he was in grade-school (do jinns go to grade-school?). Everyone that falls victim to him is just as lame as he is and you know they're gonna die and furthermore Wishmaster is doing the world a favor by reducing the lame-o's. Anyways. The Wishmaster is some kind of Disney-gone-bad type of horror flick. Kids will probably like it though (ie be scared). So I wouldn't recommend any people possibly reading this to watch Wishmaster unless you've got kids that want to see a horror movie and then imagine Wishmaster's hiding under the bed so they can keep you up all night. As you can see, it's an all around bad film.

    When i first started watching this movie i wasn't sure if i was going to like it and even considered turning it off. But i'm glad that i didn't. Wes Craven has let me down before, but not this time. I thought that it was kind of hard to get into the story but once i got in i was stuck there. The visual effects were very good considering that the movie is over ten years old. One thing i really liked was the wish master's appearance, because he actually looked kind of scary. As far as being scary, i'd give it a 6 out of 10 on the scary scale. There are a few good scares, the one that really got me is the one on the tennis court. That scare alone proves that whoever did the monster makeup did a terrific job. Another thing that i liked about this movie is that the story is fresh and it's not boring. I also like how the wish master has a dark way to twist up someone's wish. Trust me this movie is definitely worth watching and is almost a must see for true horror fans.

    Let me begin by saying this film is not as bad as it's been made out to be sure it's a gore-fest at points and yes the dialogue is cheesy but surely that is what a B-movie is meant to be? The film has more substance than sequels that seem to spawn in the realm of horror movies. The film concerns a Djinn, Arabic for genie, who escapes from a statue to wreak havoc onto the world. He can sustain a human form if he can give someone 3 wishes. Andrew Divoff is delightfully malicious as the evil Djinn. The main cast give fair performances which can only be expected in a,remember, B-Movie. At times the film tries a bit to hard to please horror fans with various winks to other horror icons, Candyman and Freddy Kruger to name a few (Tony Todd and Robert Englund, respectively). But if you want a half decent horror movie to watch and don't care too much about substance then this film will not disappoint. Conclusion. A fun B-movie and a must for all horror fans. Though it does nothing to forward the genre.

    Robert Kurtzman (the K of KNB EFX) directs this fun horror movie that is, unsurprisingly, full of fantastic special effects for those who love a good bit of inventive gore splashed throughout their movies. It's all about the djinn (played by Andrew Divoff), an evil creature who grants wishes. Sadly, these wishes are almost always rather twisted (e.g. wish for a lot of money and you may find a relative just died and left you a large sum thanks to an insurance policy) and this granter of wishes is a million miles away from the nice "genie in the lamp" image we've been fed over the years. Granting wishes and causing havoc wherever he goes, the djinn is really only biding his time until he gets the one who woke him (Tammy Lauren) to make three wishes, upon the granting of the third wish our world will become ruled by the race of the djinn. Wishmaster works well for a number of reasons. First of all, Andrew Divoff is the kind of genre star that just IS. His fantastic, calm, mocking performance is up there with the best fun performances in horror. Then we have those numerous special effects I mentioned, they really are a joy to behold and all of them are a) highly inventive and b) created with no little skill and workmanship. There's also the fun to be had, quite simply, from the central concept - a pesky genie who will grant wishes but almost never in the way that you want them granted - it's great stuff. To top things off, we get a veritable who's who of horror stars scattered throughout the film. Robert Englund is in there, Kane Hodder has a small role, Angus Scrimm narrates the intro, Reggie Bannister appears, Tony Todd is always easy to spot, Ted Raimi is there and even Tom Savini has a blink-and-you'll-miss-him moment. A decent cast, a fun script and a number of truly entertaining gory moments. And that great central performance from Andrew Divoff. It's horror genre fun, through and through. See this if you like: Wishmaster 2, Faust, The Wisher.

    People have said this movie "sucks". Well let me tell you something this movie did suck, it sucked the oxygen out of the room! For some reason this film charged up me and my roommates to the point of insanity sitting on the edge of our seats going "Nooo don't make a wish, noooo!" Yeah it was good, it did for granting wish's what Jaws did for being in the ocean. It's and old tale i know, bad genie bad wishes, where the thing goes sideways is what happens to these poor bastards. Also this film is literally loaded like a Gatling gun with horror movie icons. Every ten seconds your sitting there someone walks by, ohh there's Kane Hodder, look over there that's Tony Todd makin a bad wish.

The film has more substance than sequels that seem to spawn in the realm of horror movies. The film concerns a Djinn, Arabic for genie, who escapes from a statue to wreak havoc onto the world. He can sustain a human form if he can give someone 3 wishes. Andrew Divoff is delightfully malicious as the evil Djinn. The main cast give fair performances which can only be expected in a,remember, B-Movie. At times the film tries a bit to hard to please horror fans with various winks to other horror icons, Candyman and Freddy Kruger to name a few (Tony Todd and Robert Englund, respectively). But if you want a half decent horror movie to watch and don't care too much about substance then this film will not disappoint. Conclusion. A fun B-movie and a must for all horror fans. Though it does nothing to forward the genre.

    Robert Kurtzman (the K of KNB EFX) directs this fun horror movie that is, unsurprisingly, full of fantastic special effects for those who love a good bit of inventive gore splashed throughout their movies. It's all about the djinn (played by Andrew Divoff), an evil creature who grants wishes. Sadly, these wishes are almost always rather twisted (e.g. wish for a lot of money and you may find a relative just died and left you a large sum thanks to an insurance policy) and this granter of wishes is a million miles away from the nice "genie in the lamp" image we've been fed over the years. Granting wishes and causing havoc wherever he goes, the djinn is really only biding his time until he gets the one who woke him (Tammy Lauren) to make three wishes, upon the granting of the third wish our world will become ruled by the race of the djinn. Wishmaster works well for a number of reasons. First of all, Andrew Divoff is the kind of genre star that just IS. His fantastic, calm, mocking performance is up there with the best fun performances in horror. Then we have those numerous special effects I mentioned, they really are a joy to behold and all of them are a) highly inventive and b) created with no little skill and workmanship. There's also the fun to be had, quite simply, from the central concept - a pesky genie who will grant wishes but almost never in the way that you want them granted - it's great stuff. To top things off, we get a veritable who's who of horror stars scattered throughout the film. Robert Englund is in there, Kane Hodder has a small role, Angus Scrimm narrates the intro, Reggie Bannister appears, Tony Todd is always easy to spot, Ted Raimi is there and even Tom Savini has a blink-and-you'll-miss-him moment. A decent cast, a fun script and a number of truly entertaining gory moments. And that great central performance from Andrew Divoff. It's horror genre fun, through and through. See this if you like: Wishmaster 2, Faust, The Wisher.

    People have said this movie "sucks". Well let me tell you something this movie did suck, it sucked the oxygen out of the room! For some reason this film charged up me and my roommates to the point of insanity sitting on the edge of our seats going "Nooo don't make a wish, noooo!" Yeah it was good, it did for granting wish's what Jaws did for being in the ocean. It's and old tale i know, bad genie bad wishes, where the thing goes sideways is what happens to these poor bastards. Also this film is literally loaded like a Gatling gun with horror movie icons. Every ten seconds your sitting there someone walks by, ohh there's Kane Hodder, look over there that's Tony Todd makin a bad wish. You would think they knew, but no and to our delight we see some real tasty gore. The movie was more comical then scary which made the horror very nice. See it for yourself and don't skip on the sequel, just remember if your out and a stranger with a coffee cake face asks you to make a wish, do not do it. Unless your mad clever!

    (This a re-watch, I have seen this once before) This movie start of with a bang, I loved the first scene in the movie, very odd and very gross, the effect was really good in those scene. I found plot really well done, I found wish master not too scary, I found him a little too funny to be scary! However I found him more creepy when he had the humans face, he got one hell of a evil face I was shocked with some of tye gore in this movie , wow, I didn't not see that come, Spoiler: (He makes a prison, rip a cop Jaw right of his face, Ouch!) that had to hurt! , really fun to watch! This was a really fun movie, the acting was not too bad in this movie, it's really suited the movie well, effect were nice in this movie. I going to give this movie 7 out of 10,

    Not a bad movie. Craven has his typical moments of horror and unreality, and a wonderful monster who really is a monster in the way he manipulates people. A Djinn is released from an ancient jewel, and starts granting wishes to people who never heard the adage, "Be Careful What you Wish for". Some of those are horror icons Kane Hodder, Tony Todd and Robert Englund. The special effects, just at the beginning of CGI technology, are very effective and the character portrayals are pretty interesting. But what makes this movie work is that Craven manages to deliver the scares with some pretty good timing. Sadly, as we will see, Much like Freddy Krueger, the Wishmaster will eventually find himself in the hands of less talented masters who don't get it.

    In ancient Persia, an evil creature called the Djinn wreaks havoc on a local kingdom before being sealed inside a fire opal. Centuries later, the stone, encased in a statue, is discovered when the statue is broken apart in a loading accident. A young gemologist, Alex, examines the jewel to appraise it. But she unwittingly awakes the Djinn inside. Soon the Djinn is loose on the streets, twisting people's wishes and and killing them so he can steal their souls. Eventually the Djinn disguises himself as an elegant man-about-town, Nathaniel Demarest. In both human & Djinn form, he pursues Alexandra to trick her into making three wishes, to enable his unholy legions to conquer the Earth... Even thought the film is as subtle as a sledgehammer, it's the nearest cinema has had to a new Jason/Freddy/Michael Myers in a very long time. Ignore the Presented by... moniker, it's for status,and get ready for some proper B-movie cheese. Divoff is excellent as the titular character, and chews his lines with glee. ##Kills are inventive, but beyond these two aspects, the film is just you average horror. The inclusion of (at the time) horrors greatest stars, is a little cringe worthy, and the effects are really bad, even for the limited budget. But if you can overlook, these little flaws, it's quite an good spin on the horror genre, with something original, which was lacking at the time of release (hello ironic horror).

    With all the slashers that came after Scream, it's nice to see a gimmicky supernatural monster doing the rounds. Rather than haunting dreams, this guy grants wishes, but uses a number of amusing play on word jokes, to make sure the wishes end in disaster. It's a bit of fun and you can make a game of guessing how the exact words would be interpreted by the Djinn. There's some dodgy CGI which again takes me back to being a teen, and nice practical effects. More for gore than genuine chills, this isn't one to watch to feel scared, just watch it for the entertainment.. Divoff has a lot of fun as the Djinn, and there are plenty of horror icon cameos to spot. A fun evenings viewing.

    Had the djinn asked me for a wish, I would have said 'I wish this film were made better" and he would surely have been stumped. I decided to give this a watch after being pleasantly surprised by the somewhat obscure Devil's Rejects (I gave it 4 out of 5 stars) but alas I was disappointed. The Wishmaster is a film with Wes Craven's name attached to it- so it can't be a complete disaster (and it isn't) but the quality of the horror is downright poor. The wishmaster refers to the arcane djinn who in fact is a baddie in this film. Granting three wishes to people, he ensures that if the guys aren't laconic they are ruined in some or the other way. Another twist in this tale: Djinn got a makeover!! Yeah, he's now stone-faced guy in the present world who says things like 'S**t hit the fan' and 'F*** it!'. Quite updated, indeed. Djinn enters modern world in a gemstone and is released of course. He then torments the unlucky ones till his showdown with the girl who has the gemstone. So we have Mr.Djinn burning, drowning, decapitating, crushing, piercing and cursing (with magic) the guys in a customary fashion- he grants their wish. Girl gets visions about the djinn and is completely disregarded by her b**** sister ('Oh, we'll have to go through therapy for you again!' Ah, the unbreakable bond of sisterhood). Girl keeps getting visions on her investigations and faints, shrieks and possily farts but that's not shown. Uptight, no-nonsense girl confronts the djinn, makes four wishes (bonus for her! Not fair for the others...) and vanquishes the djinn. Yipeee!! I'm being funny because the movie is for most of the time a crash bore. There's not a tingle of fervor nor panic in the air, what's there is clich&eacute;d underacting/non-acting. Yeah, there are actors who are sooooooooo stereotypical, I thought I was watching an advertisement. A few examples: 1) The vagabond old guy 2) The shopkeeper who argues with the vagabond old guy 3) The main lady's bimbo sister and her "That's oKAYYY!" to the djinn at the basketball court (Yeah, I was watching an ad!) 4) The creepy best friend turned boyfriend (At least scream when you see a hideous creature besides you) 5) Everyone in the opening scene Now coming to the two leads. Was I seeing Claire from Modern Family in the film or what? Yeah, you can say this lady is the poor version of Sidney Prescott. Neve Campbell brought a unique confidence in her character, one that does not get too boring but doesn't scream her lungs out either. This lady (Tammy, I suppose) gives contageous headaches to the audiences. The djinn can't outbeat Freddie Krueger, who is far more entertaining (yeah, I used the right word). The entire story goes like "Wish. Kill. Wish. Kill. Wish. Kill..... Finally We meet.... Wish. Wish.. Wish... Kill.Kill..Kill...AAAHHHH....Oh!" That's it . Fortunately, its got a decent climax, with gory deaths and lots of blood. The ending is highly predictable (Don't expect me to gasp), and the last kiss between girl and best friend turned boyfriend OBVIOUS. The Wishmaster would have been a horrendous pile of elephant dung balls had it excluded the last fifteen minutes. With that, its somewhat bearable but ultimately a sloppy work. My rating: 4/10

    "Hackmaster" would've been more clever, but eh. Anyhoo, save this one for the kids. You know how you see a movie when you're a young'un that scares the pants offa you, then you see it years later and think "that was it?" This is one of those. This has "kids" written all over it because it's got a scary dude in it. As far as horror movies go, that's all it's got. The rest is an unintentional joke. A jinn/ genie? Magical wishes? OK OK I admit that could have made a good plot. But it didn't and here's why. This movie is entirely too "real life." It's like "You've Got Mail" with Freddy Kreuger playing a minor role. Whether it be more of the horrific, or just the suspense that terrorizes people in the meantime, a good horror movie needs THAT. Wishmaster going clothes shopping while the saleslady flirts with him? That's not horror. Alexandra getting killer migraines every time the Wishmaster makes a wish real? Yawn. It just doesn't work. It's comical in all it's failure to deliver. It's so BASIC. It's cheap and easy. It's terrifying if you're 6 years old. The characters are BORING. Alexandra is boring. Everyone in her life is boring. Watching the victims pile up is pretty cool, but they're still boring. I doubt anyone roots for Alex to beat the Wishmaster because neither she nor anything in the movie has given you a reason to. But I also can't see how anyone roots for the Wishmaster because HE'S lame too. Evil jinn, yeah right. This guy's a poor imitation of a real villain. He's a joke. I imagine he got pants'ed and got his milk money taken away a lot when he was in grade-school (do jinns go to grade-school?). Everyone that falls victim to him is just as lame as he is and you know they're gonna die and furthermore Wishmaster is doing the world a favor by reducing the lame-o's. Anyways. The Wishmaster is some kind of Disney-gone-bad type of horror flick. Kids will probably like it though (ie be scared). So I wouldn't recommend any people possibly reading this to watch Wishmaster unless you've got kids that want to see a horror movie and then imagine Wishmaster's hiding under the bed so they can keep you up all night. As you can see, it's an all around bad film.

    When i first started watching this movie i wasn't sure if i was going to like it and even considered turning it off. But i'm glad that i didn't. Wes Craven has let me down before, but not this time. I thought that it was kind of hard to get into the story but once i got in i was stuck there. The visual effects were very good considering that the movie is over ten years old. One thing i really liked was the wish master's appearance, because he actually looked kind of scary. As far as being scary, i'd give it a 6 out of 10 on the scary scale. There are a few good scares, the one that really got me is the one on the tennis court. That scare alone proves that whoever did the monster makeup did a terrific job. Another thing that i liked about this movie is that the story is fresh and it's not boring. I also like how the wish master has a dark way to twist up someone's wish. Trust me this movie is definitely worth watching and is almost a must see for true horror fans.
