    After Scott has a fight with his father and runs away, his father refuses to go after him. His mother, Collette, then goes to one of her former boyfriends, Jack, a lawyer, and tells him that he's her son's real father. Jack initially refuses. So she goes to another boyfriend, Dale, who goes off looking for Scott. Eventually the two men meet and realise that they are looking for the same boy and that Collette told them they are the boy's father. What follows is a desperate search and chase, because the boy doesn't want to go back.... On paper this must have sounded brilliant. Robin Williams, Billy Crystal, and Ivan Reitman. Three names that should give you comfort and confident when you know they are going to make a film together. So its a remake of a movie, The Birdcage was okay, but there is something really rotten about this movie. Williams and Crystal are as good as always, but the humour in this is just cringe worthy. Usually when you see Williams dress up and pretend, it'd be a hoot, but here, you end up feeling sorry for him. Crystal is just too violent, and here's the fundamental flaw with the film, its just too violent and dark. It should have been a family friendly movie, but the spate of innuendo, drug references, and unlikable characters, really make you dislike the film. Make it a little more slapstick, take out the vomiting, and drug lords, it would have been a winner, but its just forgettable and a dud in both stars CVs. But it has a cool Mel Gibson cameo.

    Let us see. The scene where (Williams) was trying so many "father" characters in front of a mirror, preparing for meeting his teen kid for the first time. Another one where he was personating a German producer. And a glimpse of (Crystal) as serious actor. Other than that, forget this movie, or simply, you'll do effortlessly ! Knowing that it's based on French movie leads to the fact that it isn't original. However watching it is what leads to the fact that it isn't funny! The script relies on just the presence of the 2 stars for the half of it, and makes easy toilet humor for the other. So it was between empty and disgusting. Seeing a moving human toilet (Williams at one point), or someone trapped in one (Greenwood in another) is what this movie considers as funny, and doesn't stop doing without any fear of repetition. As you see, this comedy has no talent and no conscience either ! Gathering 2 comedy rockets like (Robin Williams) and (Billy Crystal) in one movie is a great idea, this movie isn't. That neurotic actor was interesting character, but (Williams) had no actual situations or workable lines to do. That firm lawyer was supposed to be the very rational fretful opposite, which was disappointing knowing that it was played by (Crystal). The thing is he had no funny stuff, and his seriousness wasn't utilized in a funny way (unless you think that using his head to hit people is funny !). (Nastassja Kinski) and (Bruce Greenwood), naturally cameos, were imprisoned in that empty and disgusting script. Mel Gibson, most probably was coming across the studio while shooting, did an awful cameo. Again, the writing sucked there. The only one who was handled right things and did them rightly was the son. He undoubtedly was that lost, confused and desperate teen. Director (Ivan Reitman) does wonders with only creative scripts (remember Ghostbusters), so here's one movie he won't be proud of. As for the American movies based on French ones, long list during the 1980s and 1990s, this axiomatically remains in the bottom. And as a buddy comedy, other buddy comedies produced in the same year, from (Men in Black) to (Out to Sea), were more amusing and  sure  less gross! So the good side of (Fathers' Day) doesn't exceed "seeing" (Williams) and (Crystal) together in one movie. It has nothing to it script, and nothing in it feel. For the million time : Hollywood, in the last 2 decades, as if has everything except "the writing". Big tragedy that is, which you can live the most through the comedies.

    This is an American comedy staring Billy Crystal and Robin Williams and is about two grown men who are led to believe that they are the father of the same boy. An old high school girlfriend has lost her son and she approaches these men separately and tells them that the boy is their son and that he has gone missing. The men decide to seek him out and inadvertently meet and find out that they are chasing the same boy. Billy Crystal plays an upperclass lawyer who likes to think he is pretty straight and has an average life (if you count two ex-wives average, which unfortunately most people do) while Robin Williams is a crazy author who's life is quite dull, to the point where he wants to commit suicide. As for comedies, this movie is typical of America. It is funny but it is only because Robin William's character is quite bizarre. Billy Crystal, who is supposed to be a very funny comedian, is quite dull. Without the unusual character of Robin Williams, this movie would basically suck. There is a lot of Americanisms in this silly movie, such as everybody living happy at the end, and the kid lying to make everybody happy. Seriously though, lying may heal a short term wound, but it really does aggravate it in the long run. Its like putting a band aid on a bullet wound. Robin Williams' character is quite funny, but, unlike the French characters, his is just simply crazy. The French make cool characters because they are quirky. They are not outright crazy as the Americans tend to make theirs, they are just normal people with little extra things added to them. Still, can't blame them for their lack of creativity.

    Ivan Reitman's 'Fathers' Day' is a passable flick from the long-gone year 1997. It has a interesting premise & the well-known filmmaker does fairly well. It's not half as bad as it fared at the box office. 'Fathers' Day' is no milestone, nor it's a very-good film, but it surely as mentioned, is a one-time watch. The film has a decent start, a bland middle, and a fair climax. Reitmen's work, according to me, is just right. Coming straight to the acting department, Williams & Crystal both are the life of the show. Both are excel to the T. Julia Louis-Dreyfus has always been hot, and even her performance is quite okay. The Razzie Nomination was just uncalled for. Others are adequate. There's not much left to write, and a film like 'Fathers' Day' doesn't demand that either. Watch it, cause it's really not as bad as one would've told you.

    In 1983 Francis Veber did a delightful comedy called LES COMPERES, starring Gerard Depardieu and Pierre Richard, in which an ex-girlfriend approaches both men separately to help find her run-away son. It seems that, although raised by the girlfriend and her actual husband, she claims the boy was the son of either Depardieu or Richard (although she doesn't mention either of them to the other). That film follows both bungling potential daddies as they pursue their "son" and finally bring him back to his mother and her husband. American films (especially comedies) will occasionally steal ideas from French or other foreign cinemas - especially the French. It think it is more common with France because of the symbiotic relationship between our love-hate fascination with French culture, and their deep appreciation for American films. In any event, it took fourteen years before LES COMPERES was produced in the U.S. as FATHER'S DAY. It is special in several ways besides being based on such a successful French film. It is also (so far) the only co-starring vehicle for Billy Crystal and his friend and collaborator Robin Williams. They (of course) have the roles of Depardieu and Richard (although their jobs are different). The story is similar. Scott Andrews (Charles Hoffmeier) has an argument about his girlfriend Nikki Trainer (Haylee Johnson), and runs away with her. His mother Collette (Nastassja Kinski) decides to track down two old boyfriends that she had affairs with seventeen years before (the same age as Scott). One is Jack Lawrence, a successful lawyer (Crystal) and the other is an over-emotional, suicidal failed writer and actor (and mime) named Dale Putley (Williams). To both she says that the boy is actually there son. She keeps tight raps on this, but eventually her husband Bob (Bruce Greenwood) overhears her talking on the phone with Jack, and decides he must find the boy before his two rivals do. This is a change from the original movie, as the doings of Depardieu and Richards as friendly rivals was sufficiently funny by itself. Complicating Williams' search is his own emotional problems. But complicating Crystal's is that his lawyer is very busy, and on his third (presumably happy) marriage to Carrie (Julia Louis-Dreyfus). Jack turns down Colette's request at first - but when he is on a legal assignment in San Francisco (where Scott is supposed to be) he decides to get involved. Quickly it becomes apparent that Jack is far more efficient at getting to anywhere on this search than Dale - he won't take crap from anyone (as he does very effectively show with Nikki's father Russ Trainor (Charles Rocket) by almost crippling him when he starts being threatening. Dale (on the other hand) almost gets beaten up by Russ a couple of minutes afterward. The chemistry of the leads is the big plus here as they act and react with each other. At one point, when Crystal starts telling Hoffmeyer a story about his own youth, he just opens up the anecdote by saying "When I was ten years old my father took me to the circus". Williams quietly says, "That's a fascinating story.", as Crystal looks at him like he is crazy. Later, when it turns out the story really doesn't hold up too well as illustrating anything, Williams reassures Hoffmeyer "I didn't understand it either." The sequences include crashing several rock concerts, dealing with two dangerous drug dealers, bringing Hoffmeyer down to earth when he learns the girl of his dreams is not someone to die for, and reassuring Dreyfus that those crazy antics in Crystal's hotel room that she overheard on the phone were not anything to break their marriage over. There is some nice little throw away moments, such as Crystal at a legal deposition, learning from a seedy gentleman that two ruinous disasters at his previous businesses (a fire and a gas explosion - both after midnight) were "acts of God". Williams rehearsing in various costumes how to introduce himself to his "son" (including a rap artist, a sophisticate in a robe, and an eastern spiritual philosopher) is worth looking at. And then there is the cameo by Mel Gibson, as the ultimately stoned face piercing expert. The conclusion of the film is different from the French original. Some might think that a weakness, but I find it fascinating for giving an out to both men from a no-win situation. The change does not prevent the film from being entertaining to the viewer, if not as good as the original.

    If any of you have seen "Les Comperes" you know what I an talking about. This movie is just an absolute joke. Sure the big name talents make it seem like a great movie, but all in all it's just a waste of time. The storyline just doesn't seem as great. A kid runs away to follow a band. At least "Les Comperes" was funny. This was just *sighs* boring. Besides, Gerard Depardieu kicked the crap out of Francois Pignon so much it was just hilarious. This was just a watered down version of a pretty good French comedy. For once the French have done something better than us. It is a sign of things to come. Soon the U.S. will just bow down to the French as the better ones in movie making. Tis a shame!!!!!

    Robin Williams and Billy Crystal are two of the funniest men in the business and it is their own brilliance as comedians that makes FATHER'S DAY worth a look. In this rather lame comedy, a woman named Colette (a miscast Natassia Kinski)has a fight with her son (bland newcomer Charlie Hofheimer)who runs away from home to follow his girlfriend who is following a touring rock band. While the boy's father (Bruce Greenwood) sets out to find him, Colette calls two men from her past (Crystal, Williams)who she had affairs with years ago, tells both men that the boy is their son to get them to help in the search for the boy. Crystal is a successful attorney fresh into his third marriage (to Julia Louis Dreyfuss) and Williams is a suicidal writer who has a gun to his head when Colette calls. The plot takes all the routes you would expect but Williams and Crystal are so funny that you don't mind taking the ride. I suspect large portions of their scenes together are improvised and nobody does that better than these two. When these two are off-screen, the movie comes to a screeching halt, but when they are on, they somehow manage to make this convoluted mess worth sitting through. No classic, but Williams and Crystal fans might want to check it out.

    Father's Day is a cute movie with a few cameo appearances from Hollywood personalities. Sugar Ray plays several songs and Mel Gibson is a body piercer. Two men find each other as they search for a young boy who might be either of their sons. The son ends up getting in trouble as he follows Sugar Ray around to different cities and is saved from his problems by Dale (Billy Crystal) and Jack (Robin Williams). By the end of the movie, it turns out that neither of the men are the father of Scott and that Scott's mother was only using Dale and Jack to find her son for her. Both men return to their lives, happier and they both have their own women to share their future with. Its a happy, feel good movie with some good humor from Crystal and Williams. Pretty good movie, but nothing amazing to go out of your way to view. Its pretty much a Saturday afternoon sit down, relax, and have lunch kind of movie.

    I stumbled upon this movie while channel surfing and I was pretty pleased. I disagree with the other review. I thought this movie was hysterical. Robin Willaims' character, Dale, is so unstable that he can't handle any of the situations that come his way. Each thing that happened was funny... though totally unrealistic, I'll admit. The film was very well written, I thought, since a lot of the comments were very witty. I agree, though, that Collette (Scott's mother) was a weak character. She was really underdeveloped and I thought she was a pretty flat character. Overall, though, I think this movie deserves more that a "4." It's definitely worth your time.

    I liked Fathers' Day. It made me laugh. It's based on a very contrived French play, story so...well I think it took a lot of creativity to build the situations. Comedic exaggeration, physical stuff, and the tender ending, though it didn't get me to cry like Planes, Trains and Automobiles did make a good point. I relate to the whole "not knowing your father issue" and having accepted it find this movie tickles my absurd funny bone. Humorous treatments of serious issues offend some but this movie can get people talking and that's a good thing. I also like the fact that well know actors were put alongside a new actor, the one playing the young son. He did a great job portraying the ungrateful child.... Good Idea overall...

The sequences include crashing several rock concerts, dealing with two dangerous drug dealers, bringing Hoffmeyer down to earth when he learns the girl of his dreams is not someone to die for, and reassuring Dreyfus that those crazy antics in Crystal's hotel room that she overheard on the phone were not anything to break their marriage over. There is some nice little throw away moments, such as Crystal at a legal deposition, learning from a seedy gentleman that two ruinous disasters at his previous businesses (a fire and a gas explosion - both after midnight) were "acts of God". Williams rehearsing in various costumes how to introduce himself to his "son" (including a rap artist, a sophisticate in a robe, and an eastern spiritual philosopher) is worth looking at. And then there is the cameo by Mel Gibson, as the ultimately stoned face piercing expert. The conclusion of the film is different from the French original. Some might think that a weakness, but I find it fascinating for giving an out to both men from a no-win situation. The change does not prevent the film from being entertaining to the viewer, if not as good as the original.

    If any of you have seen "Les Comperes" you know what I an talking about. This movie is just an absolute joke. Sure the big name talents make it seem like a great movie, but all in all it's just a waste of time. The storyline just doesn't seem as great. A kid runs away to follow a band. At least "Les Comperes" was funny. This was just *sighs* boring. Besides, Gerard Depardieu kicked the crap out of Francois Pignon so much it was just hilarious. This was just a watered down version of a pretty good French comedy. For once the French have done something better than us. It is a sign of things to come. Soon the U.S. will just bow down to the French as the better ones in movie making. Tis a shame!!!!!

    Robin Williams and Billy Crystal are two of the funniest men in the business and it is their own brilliance as comedians that makes FATHER'S DAY worth a look. In this rather lame comedy, a woman named Colette (a miscast Natassia Kinski)has a fight with her son (bland newcomer Charlie Hofheimer)who runs away from home to follow his girlfriend who is following a touring rock band. While the boy's father (Bruce Greenwood) sets out to find him, Colette calls two men from her past (Crystal, Williams)who she had affairs with years ago, tells both men that the boy is their son to get them to help in the search for the boy. Crystal is a successful attorney fresh into his third marriage (to Julia Louis Dreyfuss) and Williams is a suicidal writer who has a gun to his head when Colette calls. The plot takes all the routes you would expect but Williams and Crystal are so funny that you don't mind taking the ride. I suspect large portions of their scenes together are improvised and nobody does that better than these two. When these two are off-screen, the movie comes to a screeching halt, but when they are on, they somehow manage to make this convoluted mess worth sitting through. No classic, but Williams and Crystal fans might want to check it out.

    Father's Day is a cute movie with a few cameo appearances from Hollywood personalities. Sugar Ray plays several songs and Mel Gibson is a body piercer. Two men find each other as they search for a young boy who might be either of their sons. The son ends up getting in trouble as he follows Sugar Ray around to different cities and is saved from his problems by Dale (Billy Crystal) and Jack (Robin Williams). By the end of the movie, it turns out that neither of the men are the father of Scott and that Scott's mother was only using Dale and Jack to find her son for her. Both men return to their lives, happier and they both have their own women to share their future with. Its a happy, feel good movie with some good humor from Crystal and Williams. Pretty good movie, but nothing amazing to go out of your way to view. Its pretty much a Saturday afternoon sit down, relax, and have lunch kind of movie.

    I stumbled upon this movie while channel surfing and I was pretty pleased. I disagree with the other review. I thought this movie was hysterical. Robin Willaims' character, Dale, is so unstable that he can't handle any of the situations that come his way. Each thing that happened was funny... though totally unrealistic, I'll admit. The film was very well written, I thought, since a lot of the comments were very witty. I agree, though, that Collette (Scott's mother) was a weak character. She was really underdeveloped and I thought she was a pretty flat character. Overall, though, I think this movie deserves more that a "4." It's definitely worth your time.

    I liked Fathers' Day. It made me laugh. It's based on a very contrived French play, story so...well I think it took a lot of creativity to build the situations. Comedic exaggeration, physical stuff, and the tender ending, though it didn't get me to cry like Planes, Trains and Automobiles did make a good point. I relate to the whole "not knowing your father issue" and having accepted it find this movie tickles my absurd funny bone. Humorous treatments of serious issues offend some but this movie can get people talking and that's a good thing. I also like the fact that well know actors were put alongside a new actor, the one playing the young son. He did a great job portraying the ungrateful child.... Good Idea overall...

    After Scott has a fight with his father and runs away, his father refuses to go after him. His mother, Collette, then goes to one of her former boyfriends, Jack, a lawyer, and tells him that he's her son's real father. Jack initially refuses. So she goes to another boyfriend, Dale, who goes off looking for Scott. Eventually the two men meet and realise that they are looking for the same boy and that Collette told them they are the boy's father. What follows is a desperate search and chase, because the boy doesn't want to go back.... On paper this must have sounded brilliant. Robin Williams, Billy Crystal, and Ivan Reitman. Three names that should give you comfort and confident when you know they are going to make a film together. So its a remake of a movie, The Birdcage was okay, but there is something really rotten about this movie. Williams and Crystal are as good as always, but the humour in this is just cringe worthy. Usually when you see Williams dress up and pretend, it'd be a hoot, but here, you end up feeling sorry for him. Crystal is just too violent, and here's the fundamental flaw with the film, its just too violent and dark. It should have been a family friendly movie, but the spate of innuendo, drug references, and unlikable characters, really make you dislike the film. Make it a little more slapstick, take out the vomiting, and drug lords, it would have been a winner, but its just forgettable and a dud in both stars CVs. But it has a cool Mel Gibson cameo.

    Let us see. The scene where (Williams) was trying so many "father" characters in front of a mirror, preparing for meeting his teen kid for the first time. Another one where he was personating a German producer. And a glimpse of (Crystal) as serious actor. Other than that, forget this movie, or simply, you'll do effortlessly ! Knowing that it's based on French movie leads to the fact that it isn't original. However watching it is what leads to the fact that it isn't funny! The script relies on just the presence of the 2 stars for the half of it, and makes easy toilet humor for the other. So it was between empty and disgusting. Seeing a moving human toilet (Williams at one point), or someone trapped in one (Greenwood in another) is what this movie considers as funny, and doesn't stop doing without any fear of repetition. As you see, this comedy has no talent and no conscience either ! Gathering 2 comedy rockets like (Robin Williams) and (Billy Crystal) in one movie is a great idea, this movie isn't. That neurotic actor was interesting character, but (Williams) had no actual situations or workable lines to do. That firm lawyer was supposed to be the very rational fretful opposite, which was disappointing knowing that it was played by (Crystal). The thing is he had no funny stuff, and his seriousness wasn't utilized in a funny way (unless you think that using his head to hit people is funny !). (Nastassja Kinski) and (Bruce Greenwood), naturally cameos, were imprisoned in that empty and disgusting script. Mel Gibson, most probably was coming across the studio while shooting, did an awful cameo. Again, the writing sucked there. The only one who was handled right things and did them rightly was the son. He undoubtedly was that lost, confused and desperate teen. Director (Ivan Reitman) does wonders with only creative scripts (remember Ghostbusters), so here's one movie he won't be proud of. As for the American movies based on French ones, long list during the 1980s and 1990s, this axiomatically remains in the bottom. And as a buddy comedy, other buddy comedies produced in the same year, from (Men in Black) to (Out to Sea), were more amusing and  sure  less gross! So the good side of (Fathers' Day) doesn't exceed "seeing" (Williams) and (Crystal) together in one movie. It has nothing to it script, and nothing in it feel. For the million time : Hollywood, in the last 2 decades, as if has everything except "the writing". Big tragedy that is, which you can live the most through the comedies.

    This is an American comedy staring Billy Crystal and Robin Williams and is about two grown men who are led to believe that they are the father of the same boy. An old high school girlfriend has lost her son and she approaches these men separately and tells them that the boy is their son and that he has gone missing. The men decide to seek him out and inadvertently meet and find out that they are chasing the same boy. Billy Crystal plays an upperclass lawyer who likes to think he is pretty straight and has an average life (if you count two ex-wives average, which unfortunately most people do) while Robin Williams is a crazy author who's life is quite dull, to the point where he wants to commit suicide. As for comedies, this movie is typical of America. It is funny but it is only because Robin William's character is quite bizarre. Billy Crystal, who is supposed to be a very funny comedian, is quite dull. Without the unusual character of Robin Williams, this movie would basically suck. There is a lot of Americanisms in this silly movie, such as everybody living happy at the end, and the kid lying to make everybody happy. Seriously though, lying may heal a short term wound, but it really does aggravate it in the long run. Its like putting a band aid on a bullet wound. Robin Williams' character is quite funny, but, unlike the French characters, his is just simply crazy. The French make cool characters because they are quirky. They are not outright crazy as the Americans tend to make theirs, they are just normal people with little extra things added to them. Still, can't blame them for their lack of creativity.

    Ivan Reitman's 'Fathers' Day' is a passable flick from the long-gone year 1997. It has a interesting premise & the well-known filmmaker does fairly well. It's not half as bad as it fared at the box office. 'Fathers' Day' is no milestone, nor it's a very-good film, but it surely as mentioned, is a one-time watch. The film has a decent start, a bland middle, and a fair climax. Reitmen's work, according to me, is just right. Coming straight to the acting department, Williams & Crystal both are the life of the show. Both are excel to the T. Julia Louis-Dreyfus has always been hot, and even her performance is quite okay. The Razzie Nomination was just uncalled for. Others are adequate. There's not much left to write, and a film like 'Fathers' Day' doesn't demand that either. Watch it, cause it's really not as bad as one would've told you.

    Good Remake of Francis Veber's Les Comperes

    In 1983 Francis Veber did a delightful comedy called LES COMPERES, starring Gerard Depardieu and Pierre Richard, in which an ex-girlfriend approaches both men separately to help find her run-away son. It seems that, although raised by the girlfriend and her actual husband, she claims the boy was the son of either Depardieu or Richard (although she doesn't mention either of them to the other). That film follows both bungling potential daddies as they pursue their "son" and finally bring him back to his mother and her husband. American films (especially comedies) will occasionally steal ideas from French or other foreign cinemas - especially the French. It think it is more common with France because of the symbiotic relationship between our love-hate fascination with French culture, and their deep appreciation for American films. In any event, it took fourteen years before LES COMPERES was produced in the U.S. as FATHER'S DAY. It is special in several ways besides being based on such a successful French film. It is also (so far) the only co-starring vehicle for Billy Crystal and his friend and collaborator Robin Williams. They (of course) have the roles of Depardieu and Richard (although their jobs are different). The story is similar. Scott Andrews (Charles Hoffmeier) has an argument about his girlfriend Nikki Trainer (Haylee Johnson), and runs away with her. His mother Collette (Nastassja Kinski) decides to track down two old boyfriends that she had affairs with seventeen years before (the same age as Scott). One is Jack Lawrence, a successful lawyer (Crystal) and the other is an over-emotional, suicidal failed writer and actor (and mime) named Dale Putley (Williams). To both she says that the boy is actually there son. She keeps tight raps on this, but eventually her husband Bob (Bruce Greenwood) overhears her talking on the phone with Jack, and decides he must find the boy before his two rivals do. This is a change from the original movie, as the doings of Depardieu and Richards as friendly rivals was sufficiently funny by itself. Complicating Williams' search is his own emotional problems. But complicating Crystal's is that his lawyer is very busy, and on his third (presumably happy) marriage to Carrie (Julia Louis-Dreyfus). Jack turns down Colette's request at first - but when he is on a legal assignment in San Francisco (where Scott is supposed to be) he decides to get involved. Quickly it becomes apparent that Jack is far more efficient at getting to anywhere on this search than Dale - he won't take crap from anyone (as he does very effectively show with Nikki's father Russ Trainor (Charles Rocket) by almost crippling him when he starts being threatening. Dale (on the other hand) almost gets beaten up by Russ a couple of minutes afterward. The chemistry of the leads is the big plus here as they act and react with each other. At one point, when Crystal starts telling Hoffmeyer a story about his own youth, he just opens up the anecdote by saying "When I was ten years old my father took me to the circus". Williams quietly says, "That's a fascinating story.", as Crystal looks at him like he is crazy. Later, when it turns out the story really doesn't hold up too well as illustrating anything, Williams reassures Hoffmeyer "I didn't understand it either." The sequences include crashing several rock concerts, dealing with two dangerous drug dealers, bringing Hoffmeyer down to earth when he learns the girl of his dreams is not someone to die for, and reassuring Dreyfus that those crazy antics in Crystal's hotel room that she overheard on the phone were not anything to break their marriage over. There is some nice little throw away moments, such as Crystal at a legal deposition, learning from a seedy gentleman that two ruinous disasters at his previous businesses (a fire and a gas explosion - both after midnight) were "acts of God". Williams rehearsing in various costumes how to introduce himself to his "son" (including a rap artist, a sophisticate in a robe, and an eastern spiritual philosopher) is worth looking at. And then there is the cameo by Mel Gibson, as the ultimately stoned face piercing expert. The conclusion of the film is different from the French original. Some might think that a weakness, but I find it fascinating for giving an out to both men from a no-win situation. The change does not prevent the film from being entertaining to the viewer, if not as good as the original.

    Ivan Reitman's 'Fathers' Day' is a passable flick from the long-gone year 1997. It has a interesting premise & the well-known filmmaker does fairly well. It's not half as bad as it fared at the box office. 'Fathers' Day' is no milestone, nor it's a very-good film, but it surely as mentioned, is a one-time watch. The film has a decent start, a bland middle, and a fair climax. Reitmen's work, according to me, is just right. Coming straight to the acting department, Williams & Crystal both are the life of the show. Both are excel to the T. Julia Louis-Dreyfus has always been hot, and even her performance is quite okay. The Razzie Nomination was just uncalled for. Others are adequate. There's not much left to write, and a film like 'Fathers' Day' doesn't demand that either. Watch it, cause it's really not as bad as one would've told you.

    In 1983 Francis Veber did a delightful comedy called LES COMPERES, starring Gerard Depardieu and Pierre Richard, in which an ex-girlfriend approaches both men separately to help find her run-away son. It seems that, although raised by the girlfriend and her actual husband, she claims the boy was the son of either Depardieu or Richard (although she doesn't mention either of them to the other). That film follows both bungling potential daddies as they pursue their "son" and finally bring him back to his mother and her husband. American films (especially comedies) will occasionally steal ideas from French or other foreign cinemas - especially the French. It think it is more common with France because of the symbiotic relationship between our love-hate fascination with French culture, and their deep appreciation for American films. In any event, it took fourteen years before LES COMPERES was produced in the U.S. as FATHER'S DAY. It is special in several ways besides being based on such a successful French film. It is also (so far) the only co-starring vehicle for Billy Crystal and his friend and collaborator Robin Williams. They (of course) have the roles of Depardieu and Richard (although their jobs are different). The story is similar. Scott Andrews (Charles Hoffmeier) has an argument about his girlfriend Nikki Trainer (Haylee Johnson), and runs away with her. His mother Collette (Nastassja Kinski) decides to track down two old boyfriends that she had affairs with seventeen years before (the same age as Scott). One is Jack Lawrence, a successful lawyer (Crystal) and the other is an over-emotional, suicidal failed writer and actor (and mime) named Dale Putley (Williams). To both she says that the boy is actually there son. She keeps tight raps on this, but eventually her husband Bob (Bruce Greenwood) overhears her talking on the phone with Jack, and decides he must find the boy before his two rivals do. This is a change from the original movie, as the doings of Depardieu and Richards as friendly rivals was sufficiently funny by itself. Complicating Williams' search is his own emotional problems. But complicating Crystal's is that his lawyer is very busy, and on his third (presumably happy) marriage to Carrie (Julia Louis-Dreyfus). Jack turns down Colette's request at first - but when he is on a legal assignment in San Francisco (where Scott is supposed to be) he decides to get involved. Quickly it becomes apparent that Jack is far more efficient at getting to anywhere on this search than Dale - he won't take crap from anyone (as he does very effectively show with Nikki's father Russ Trainor (Charles Rocket) by almost crippling him when he starts being threatening. Dale (on the other hand) almost gets beaten up by Russ a couple of minutes afterward. The chemistry of the leads is the big plus here as they act and react with each other. At one point, when Crystal starts telling Hoffmeyer a story about his own youth, he just opens up the anecdote by saying "When I was ten years old my father took me to the circus". Williams quietly says, "That's a fascinating story.", as Crystal looks at him like he is crazy. Later, when it turns out the story really doesn't hold up too well as illustrating anything, Williams reassures Hoffmeyer "I didn't understand it either." The sequences include crashing several rock concerts, dealing with two dangerous drug dealers, bringing Hoffmeyer down to earth when he learns the girl of his dreams is not someone to die for, and reassuring Dreyfus that those crazy antics in Crystal's hotel room that she overheard on the phone were not anything to break their marriage over. There is some nice little throw away moments, such as Crystal at a legal deposition, learning from a seedy gentleman that two ruinous disasters at his previous businesses (a fire and a gas explosion - both after midnight) were "acts of God". Williams rehearsing in various costumes how to introduce himself to his "son" (including a rap artist, a sophisticate in a robe, and an eastern spiritual philosopher) is worth looking at. And then there is the cameo by Mel Gibson, as the ultimately stoned face piercing expert. The conclusion of the film is different from the French original. Some might think that a weakness, but I find it fascinating for giving an out to both men from a no-win situation. The change does not prevent the film from being entertaining to the viewer, if not as good as the original.

    If any of you have seen "Les Comperes" you know what I an talking about. This movie is just an absolute joke. Sure the big name talents make it seem like a great movie, but all in all it's just a waste of time. The storyline just doesn't seem as great. A kid runs away to follow a band. At least "Les Comperes" was funny. This was just *sighs* boring. Besides, Gerard Depardieu kicked the crap out of Francois Pignon so much it was just hilarious. This was just a watered down version of a pretty good French comedy. For once the French have done something better than us. It is a sign of things to come. Soon the U.S. will just bow down to the French as the better ones in movie making. Tis a shame!!!!!

    Robin Williams and Billy Crystal are two of the funniest men in the business and it is their own brilliance as comedians that makes FATHER'S DAY worth a look. In this rather lame comedy, a woman named Colette (a miscast Natassia Kinski)has a fight with her son (bland newcomer Charlie Hofheimer)who runs away from home to follow his girlfriend who is following a touring rock band. While the boy's father (Bruce Greenwood) sets out to find him, Colette calls two men from her past (Crystal, Williams)who she had affairs with years ago, tells both men that the boy is their son to get them to help in the search for the boy. Crystal is a successful attorney fresh into his third marriage (to Julia Louis Dreyfuss) and Williams is a suicidal writer who has a gun to his head when Colette calls. The plot takes all the routes you would expect but Williams and Crystal are so funny that you don't mind taking the ride. I suspect large portions of their scenes together are improvised and nobody does that better than these two. When these two are off-screen, the movie comes to a screeching halt, but when they are on, they somehow manage to make this convoluted mess worth sitting through. No classic, but Williams and Crystal fans might want to check it out.

    Father's Day is a cute movie with a few cameo appearances from Hollywood personalities. Sugar Ray plays several songs and Mel Gibson is a body piercer. Two men find each other as they search for a young boy who might be either of their sons. The son ends up getting in trouble as he follows Sugar Ray around to different cities and is saved from his problems by Dale (Billy Crystal) and Jack (Robin Williams). By the end of the movie, it turns out that neither of the men are the father of Scott and that Scott's mother was only using Dale and Jack to find her son for her. Both men return to their lives, happier and they both have their own women to share their future with. Its a happy, feel good movie with some good humor from Crystal and Williams. Pretty good movie, but nothing amazing to go out of your way to view. Its pretty much a Saturday afternoon sit down, relax, and have lunch kind of movie.

    I stumbled upon this movie while channel surfing and I was pretty pleased. I disagree with the other review. I thought this movie was hysterical. Robin Willaims' character, Dale, is so unstable that he can't handle any of the situations that come his way. Each thing that happened was funny... though totally unrealistic, I'll admit. The film was very well written, I thought, since a lot of the comments were very witty. I agree, though, that Collette (Scott's mother) was a weak character. She was really underdeveloped and I thought she was a pretty flat character. Overall, though, I think this movie deserves more that a "4." It's definitely worth your time.

    I liked Fathers' Day. It made me laugh. It's based on a very contrived French play, story so...well I think it took a lot of creativity to build the situations. Comedic exaggeration, physical stuff, and the tender ending, though it didn't get me to cry like Planes, Trains and Automobiles did make a good point. I relate to the whole "not knowing your father issue" and having accepted it find this movie tickles my absurd funny bone. Humorous treatments of serious issues offend some but this movie can get people talking and that's a good thing. I also like the fact that well know actors were put alongside a new actor, the one playing the young son. He did a great job portraying the ungrateful child.... Good Idea overall...

    After Scott has a fight with his father and runs away, his father refuses to go after him. His mother, Collette, then goes to one of her former boyfriends, Jack, a lawyer, and tells him that he's her son's real father. Jack initially refuses. So she goes to another boyfriend, Dale, who goes off looking for Scott. Eventually the two men meet and realise that they are looking for the same boy and that Collette told them they are the boy's father. What follows is a desperate search and chase, because the boy doesn't want to go back.... On paper this must have sounded brilliant. Robin Williams, Billy Crystal, and Ivan Reitman. Three names that should give you comfort and confident when you know they are going to make a film together. So its a remake of a movie, The Birdcage was okay, but there is something really rotten about this movie. Williams and Crystal are as good as always, but the humour in this is just cringe worthy. Usually when you see Williams dress up and pretend, it'd be a hoot, but here, you end up feeling sorry for him. Crystal is just too violent, and here's the fundamental flaw with the film, its just too violent and dark. It should have been a family friendly movie, but the spate of innuendo, drug references, and unlikable characters, really make you dislike the film. Make it a little more slapstick, take out the vomiting, and drug lords, it would have been a winner, but its just forgettable and a dud in both stars CVs. But it has a cool Mel Gibson cameo.

    Let us see. The scene where (Williams) was trying so many "father" characters in front of a mirror, preparing for meeting his teen kid for the first time. Another one where he was personating a German producer. And a glimpse of (Crystal) as serious actor. Other than that, forget this movie, or simply, you'll do effortlessly ! Knowing that it's based on French movie leads to the fact that it isn't original. However watching it is what leads to the fact that it isn't funny! The script relies on just the presence of the 2 stars for the half of it, and makes easy toilet humor for the other. So it was between empty and disgusting. Seeing a moving human toilet (Williams at one point), or someone trapped in one (Greenwood in another) is what this movie considers as funny, and doesn't stop doing without any fear of repetition. As you see, this comedy has no talent and no conscience either ! Gathering 2 comedy rockets like (Robin Williams) and (Billy Crystal) in one movie is a great idea, this movie isn't. That neurotic actor was interesting character, but (Williams) had no actual situations or workable lines to do. That firm lawyer was supposed to be the very rational fretful opposite, which was disappointing knowing that it was played by (Crystal). The thing is he had no funny stuff, and his seriousness wasn't utilized in a funny way (unless you think that using his head to hit people is funny !). (Nastassja Kinski) and (Bruce Greenwood), naturally cameos, were imprisoned in that empty and disgusting script. Mel Gibson, most probably was coming across the studio while shooting, did an awful cameo. Again, the writing sucked there. The only one who was handled right things and did them rightly was the son. He undoubtedly was that lost, confused and desperate teen. Director (Ivan Reitman) does wonders with only creative scripts (remember Ghostbusters), so here's one movie he won't be proud of. As for the American movies based on French ones, long list during the 1980s and 1990s, this axiomatically remains in the bottom. And as a buddy comedy, other buddy comedies produced in the same year, from (Men in Black) to (Out to Sea), were more amusing and  sure  less gross! So the good side of (Fathers' Day) doesn't exceed "seeing" (Williams) and (Crystal) together in one movie. It has nothing to it script, and nothing in it feel. For the million time : Hollywood, in the last 2 decades, as if has everything except "the writing". Big tragedy that is, which you can live the most through the comedies.

    This is an American comedy staring Billy Crystal and Robin Williams and is about two grown men who are led to believe that they are the father of the same boy. An old high school girlfriend has lost her son and she approaches these men separately and tells them that the boy is their son and that he has gone missing. The men decide to seek him out and inadvertently meet and find out that they are chasing the same boy. Billy Crystal plays an upperclass lawyer who likes to think he is pretty straight and has an average life (if you count two ex-wives average, which unfortunately most people do) while Robin Williams is a crazy author who's life is quite dull, to the point where he wants to commit suicide. As for comedies, this movie is typical of America. It is funny but it is only because Robin William's character is quite bizarre. Billy Crystal, who is supposed to be a very funny comedian, is quite dull. Without the unusual character of Robin Williams, this movie would basically suck. There is a lot of Americanisms in this silly movie, such as everybody living happy at the end, and the kid lying to make everybody happy. Seriously though, lying may heal a short term wound, but it really does aggravate it in the long run. Its like putting a band aid on a bullet wound. Robin Williams' character is quite funny, but, unlike the French characters, his is just simply crazy. The French make cool characters because they are quirky. They are not outright crazy as the Americans tend to make theirs, they are just normal people with little extra things added to them. Still, can't blame them for their lack of creativity.
