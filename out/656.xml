    I can totally recognize how influential and ahead of its time Fritz Lang's M was, but I wasn't that impressed for the most part of the film unfortunately. First of all, the camera work is simply outstanding, having plenty of overhead shots as well as innovative techniques. I was quite surprised by how deep the story got in the last 15 minutes of the film, which led to a very powerful ending. The most interesting aspect here is the presence of a strong social criticism, demonstrated in the final discussions. Also, Peter Lorre was absolutely brilliant as Hans Beckert, the serial killer who murders children, making us believe how his heinous acts of violence are driven by this extreme compulsion within him. Now there are some things that bothered me. I felt the investigation scenes were too expository and overly stretched, making the film a little bloated. In addition, many scenes seemed to be sped up so that annoyed me a bit as they looked pretty unnatural. Finally, I didn't find any of the characters, apart from Hans Beckert, to be very interesting so that made it harder to get really engaged with the story sometimes. Overall, M is undoubtedly a revolutionary film and its ending was truly brilliant, but it had its bumps along the way.

    **1/2 out of **** Early German thriller from Fritz Lang ("Metropolis"), spotlighting a young Peter Lorre as a crazed child murderer. He selects innocent young girls and discreetly walks off with them, leaving the police force baffled as to trying to apprehend him and bring him to justice. So a concerned vigilante mob consisting of average citizens and hardened criminals take matters into their own hands in trying to catch the killer without interference from the law. My basic summation above sounds far more interesting than the way this overrated film plays out. I just re-watched this for my third (but final) time, on a Criterion DVD which offered the original German language version with English subtitles. The movie has a troubled history of having different prints at varying lengths, and this one was way overlong at around 109 minutes. I first saw M at the Film Forum in NYC, around the late 1990's. (It may have been a shorter English-dubbed version). At that time I recall being impressed at least with the intense ending, which highlights an emotional and sympathetic performance by Peter Lorre, where he is thrown at the mercy of a kangaroo court and actually pleads for the audience to consider his compulsions from his own warped perspective. It was based on that memory that I picked up the Criterion DVD release at the time it came out, which I may have spun maybe only one other time after I first bought it. However, I found this newest viewing to be dull and prolonged, with endless scenes of police procedures and discussions. Peter Lorre's screen time was precious little, and he only got to shine at the end for the last 15 minutes or so -- which was a good scene, but not worth enduring the rest of this tedium. There was not much in the way of "directorial flourishes". There are some nice suggestive visual setups at the opening to allude to Lorre's crimes, but that was about all. Just too much contemplating, searching, investigating, talking, meandering, to take up the most inflated guts of this film.

    A murderer of girls has frightened the entire city. The police are looking frantically, desperately, arresting anyone suspected. For other part, the leaders of the mob, angered by the raids that are suffering because of the murderer, they decide to seek their own It is the first film where a serial murderer appears, and without staying in the mere collection morbid murders the film makes a profound reflection on German society broken by war, economic instability, unemployment and crime. Fritz Lang got with "M" draw the profile of psychopath who later follow all his colleagues with varied shades. In the final scene, Peter Lorre shakes the heart of any viewer with its final monologue, achieving a degree of empathy with the public Lang movie structured into three parts. The first shows the murderer and their consequences. The second shows the viewer the competition between law enforcement, criticized for their lack of results and criminals harassed by the police in their search for the murderer, to reach the same goal but with different methods. And in the third, which is the most daunting a merciless manhunt. Both the pace, as the narrative, as the assembly of this film have nothing to learn any modern Thriler. Its advances in sound are memorable and the ability to Lang framing or sticking out all the juice possible (with Arno Wagner) of black and white photography is extraordinary. Especially memorable are the great opening sequence and comparison established between cops and robbers.

    Hailed as Director Fritz Lang's finest not just by critics & fans alike but Lang himself, M is a brilliantly written & directed psychological thriller about a serial killer, played superbly by Peter Lorre, and presents an underworld society that, after police's continued failure in arresting the accused & causing raids everyday which leads to disruptions & losses in the underworld daily lives, takes matters in their own hands in capturing the serial killer themselves. Brimming with superb screenplay, wonderfully crafted suspense, satisfying performances, superb photography & painting a very unusual picture of criminals trying to capture another criminal & then talking about justice or law & order, M is a thought-provoking & well-researched study into the mind of a serial killer and about the morals of right & wrong as well as our own society.

    Listen here: http://moccast.blogspot.no/2013/05/episode-three-m.html A colleague of mine recently asked about 'that film that used to be on with Peter Lore'. I instantly replied 'M'; it wasn't some smug retort to show how film literate I was it, was because of the simple fact M is not shown on television anymore. Why? Well I dare say the answer may have something to do with the fact that despite being made in 1931 it is as shocking today as it was upon its original release. Indeed, M is one of the rare films to never lose its relevancy, to never cease asking the type of questions that society chooses to ignore. Fritz Lang didn't just make a film about a serial killer and a police investigation designed to thrill audiences, he made a film that probed areas of psychology and the world we live that wasn't just native to the films country Germany; but one that transcends national boundaries and more worryingly time. In this episode we delve into M share our thoughts on what makes it such an important addition to the Masters of Cinema collection. http://moccast.blogspot.no/2013/05/episode-three-m.html

    Fritz Lang has always been one of my favorites and so is his masterpiece M. almost any of Lang's films can be related to M in some way. Here, we have a chance to travel into the mind of a madman and maybe even our own mind, as the title of the film suggests. (murderers among us), something that resonates again in Lang's later films such as Fury (1936) In M, LANG brilliantly succeeds in creating an atmosphere of menace through the use of sound. There are moments of dead silence which is sometimes broken abruptly, creating a feeling of unease. Lang also shows influence from Murnau (particularly "the last laugh") in terms of camera movements. I never forget a scene in which camera goes up the wall and (then through the window), enters the room in which beggars are being organized it is interesting that the cooperation between thieves and beggars is effectively organized as each beggar even receives a personnel number Also unforgettable for me are the shots that show Elsie's absence; an empty chair, empty staircase and finally Elsie' ball moving on the bushes and her balloon that is released from telephone wires. Definitely a great success for Herr Lang for all its cinematic achievements

    Peter Lorre stars in "M," a 1931 German Expressionist film directed by Fritz Lang. I saw a restored version of this film -- apparently over the years it has been being pieced together when new sections are found. This ran 111 minutes. Lorre plays a child murderer (and probably molester, though that isn't stated) who is terrorizing a town in Germany and writing to the police and to the press. Believe it or not, with such a serious and daring subject, the film actually has some humor. When the police can't get the murderer, a group of burglars, angry at all the extra security and difficulties the murderer has caused them, decide they have to get him themselves. They round up beggars, who are everywhere and not noticed, and the burglars watch them. Each person is responsible for a section of the city. The acting is marvelous. Lorre is magnificent as a pathetic man who has a compulsion to kill. The other actors are wonderful as well. Due to the difference in acting styles today, the audience laughed in a couple of places that were not meant to be laughed at. That's understandable. The film has sections which are completely silent, with no music. The end of the film is a little abrupt, but nevertheless effective. This is a true masterpiece from the hand of Fritz Lang, who also co-wrote the script. The print was excellent as well, and the film is in German with English subtitles. It was important to see the newly found pieces of the film, though I'm not sure how much it added. Definitely a film to see with Peter Lorre's great performance that made him a star.

    The movie opens with couple of children playing in front of an apartment, and a mother setting table for lunch for her daughter, yet to return from school. Everything seems normal and that's when the spine chilling felonious character surfaces. We immediately learn that, there is a child murderer in the town and has already slay ed 8 children and the girl whose mother is waiting for lunch is the ninth victim. The town becomes unrest about the untamed psychopath, still at large. The Police in desperation start raiding every corner of the town. The sudden surge in Police activity is a bad news for local gangsters and crime syndicates, as these raids disturb their business. The bad guys of underworld arrange a clandestine meet to decide how to get rid of Police raids. Only way they find is to catch the pathological child killer, the police looking for. The syndicate puts every beggar in the town on the man hunt. Each street will be monitored by a beggar and he'll keep an eye on the every girl child in the street until she goes in to home or school or passes to the next street. The effort pays off. A blind man selling balloons, hears a man passing by whistling and he suddenly recalls that the tune was same from a man who purchased a balloon for school girl few weeks ago, and the same day the girl went missing. The killer already has tenth victim with him, lured by a candy. The vendor quickly alerts nearest beggar, and the beggar, in order to not to lose the murderer in the crowd, pretends to slip and clutches the killer for support and transfers onto the back on his shoulder a big 'M' that he previously chalked on his palm. The murderer is caught and is bought to a remote warehouse to face trial. The trial is conducted by the parents of the victims, beggars and the underworld syndicate who hatched the plan. The murderer kind of defends his actions complaining that he is driven by these uncontrollable evil urges and blames his mental condition for his actions and pleads, others do not understand what he is going through. Just when the jury is about to declare verdict, police arrive and take him into custody. The real trial begins as the movie ends with a mother saying ' no sentence would bring back the dead children, and One has to keep closer watch over the children." The screen goes black as she adds, "All of you'.

    It's difficult to believe this is the man's first sound film. I prefer "Das Testament des Dr. Mabuse" (1933) not only as entertainment but also as an epitome of the exploration of the marriage between sight and sound, but this brilliant, too. The way he ties images and sounds together in a delirious dance makes me feel like I am at the heart of a mystery being unravelled, a symphony unfolding. I know Lang himself considered himself as a "social" director tackling "social" issues. For me his strength lies elsewhere, that is, in the beautiful editing of visually strong images into visually strong narratives. And his use of sound strengthens this: it's quite a marvel to witness how some sounds anticipate certain images and certain images give way to certain sounds. This film is most certainly an inspiration for B&eacute;la Tarr's "Werckmeister harm&oacute;ni&aacute;k" (2000), and unsurprisingly Tarr voted this as one of the top ten films in the 2012 Sight & Sound poll. There's the same sense of societal paranoia that projects into the black-and-white frame, especially in the crowd scenes.

    Overlong for sure and with a rather abrupt ending, this remarkably suspense filled film, is quite spellbinding at points, able to view several facets of society and interweave a number of stories with great clarity. Peter Lorre gives an impassioned performance, playing a servile and repugnant child murderer, before finally giving a powerful speech rebuking his captors and supplying an emotional and sympathetic statement on his plight. His performance is so good, we understand his problems, and any murderous intent we once had is quickly drained. As an essay on justice, and its motivations, the film weaves in its themes with great skill, the director able to juggle, drama, suspense, and a very real message with remarkable impact. The cinematography is amazing, able to tell a story with its powerful image easily: a strong visual drama. And the directors ability to illuminate the room and create emotion with his images is also very good, creating a paranoid or claustrophobic atmosphere with ease. Music is used sparingly, and the taut silence of chases, is particularly good. The editing is amazing for a film of this age, and create good tense storytelling with both complexity and clarity. The film lags a little in places, and could be tightened up all round, to create a taut, powerful thriller. But otherwise it is strong all round, with great images, performances, and production.

The real trial begins as the movie ends with a mother saying ' no sentence would bring back the dead children, and One has to keep closer watch over the children." The screen goes black as she adds, "All of you'.

    It's difficult to believe this is the man's first sound film. I prefer "Das Testament des Dr. Mabuse" (1933) not only as entertainment but also as an epitome of the exploration of the marriage between sight and sound, but this brilliant, too. The way he ties images and sounds together in a delirious dance makes me feel like I am at the heart of a mystery being unravelled, a symphony unfolding. I know Lang himself considered himself as a "social" director tackling "social" issues. For me his strength lies elsewhere, that is, in the beautiful editing of visually strong images into visually strong narratives. And his use of sound strengthens this: it's quite a marvel to witness how some sounds anticipate certain images and certain images give way to certain sounds. This film is most certainly an inspiration for B&eacute;la Tarr's "Werckmeister harm&oacute;ni&aacute;k" (2000), and unsurprisingly Tarr voted this as one of the top ten films in the 2012 Sight & Sound poll. There's the same sense of societal paranoia that projects into the black-and-white frame, especially in the crowd scenes.

    Overlong for sure and with a rather abrupt ending, this remarkably suspense filled film, is quite spellbinding at points, able to view several facets of society and interweave a number of stories with great clarity. Peter Lorre gives an impassioned performance, playing a servile and repugnant child murderer, before finally giving a powerful speech rebuking his captors and supplying an emotional and sympathetic statement on his plight. His performance is so good, we understand his problems, and any murderous intent we once had is quickly drained. As an essay on justice, and its motivations, the film weaves in its themes with great skill, the director able to juggle, drama, suspense, and a very real message with remarkable impact. The cinematography is amazing, able to tell a story with its powerful image easily: a strong visual drama. And the directors ability to illuminate the room and create emotion with his images is also very good, creating a paranoid or claustrophobic atmosphere with ease. Music is used sparingly, and the taut silence of chases, is particularly good. The editing is amazing for a film of this age, and create good tense storytelling with both complexity and clarity. The film lags a little in places, and could be tightened up all round, to create a taut, powerful thriller. But otherwise it is strong all round, with great images, performances, and production.

    I can totally recognize how influential and ahead of its time Fritz Lang's M was, but I wasn't that impressed for the most part of the film unfortunately. First of all, the camera work is simply outstanding, having plenty of overhead shots as well as innovative techniques. I was quite surprised by how deep the story got in the last 15 minutes of the film, which led to a very powerful ending. The most interesting aspect here is the presence of a strong social criticism, demonstrated in the final discussions. Also, Peter Lorre was absolutely brilliant as Hans Beckert, the serial killer who murders children, making us believe how his heinous acts of violence are driven by this extreme compulsion within him. Now there are some things that bothered me. I felt the investigation scenes were too expository and overly stretched, making the film a little bloated. In addition, many scenes seemed to be sped up so that annoyed me a bit as they looked pretty unnatural. Finally, I didn't find any of the characters, apart from Hans Beckert, to be very interesting so that made it harder to get really engaged with the story sometimes. Overall, M is undoubtedly a revolutionary film and its ending was truly brilliant, but it had its bumps along the way.

    **1/2 out of **** Early German thriller from Fritz Lang ("Metropolis"), spotlighting a young Peter Lorre as a crazed child murderer. He selects innocent young girls and discreetly walks off with them, leaving the police force baffled as to trying to apprehend him and bring him to justice. So a concerned vigilante mob consisting of average citizens and hardened criminals take matters into their own hands in trying to catch the killer without interference from the law. My basic summation above sounds far more interesting than the way this overrated film plays out. I just re-watched this for my third (but final) time, on a Criterion DVD which offered the original German language version with English subtitles. The movie has a troubled history of having different prints at varying lengths, and this one was way overlong at around 109 minutes. I first saw M at the Film Forum in NYC, around the late 1990's. (It may have been a shorter English-dubbed version). At that time I recall being impressed at least with the intense ending, which highlights an emotional and sympathetic performance by Peter Lorre, where he is thrown at the mercy of a kangaroo court and actually pleads for the audience to consider his compulsions from his own warped perspective. It was based on that memory that I picked up the Criterion DVD release at the time it came out, which I may have spun maybe only one other time after I first bought it. However, I found this newest viewing to be dull and prolonged, with endless scenes of police procedures and discussions. Peter Lorre's screen time was precious little, and he only got to shine at the end for the last 15 minutes or so -- which was a good scene, but not worth enduring the rest of this tedium. There was not much in the way of "directorial flourishes". There are some nice suggestive visual setups at the opening to allude to Lorre's crimes, but that was about all. Just too much contemplating, searching, investigating, talking, meandering, to take up the most inflated guts of this film.

    A murderer of girls has frightened the entire city. The police are looking frantically, desperately, arresting anyone suspected. For other part, the leaders of the mob, angered by the raids that are suffering because of the murderer, they decide to seek their own It is the first film where a serial murderer appears, and without staying in the mere collection morbid murders the film makes a profound reflection on German society broken by war, economic instability, unemployment and crime. Fritz Lang got with "M" draw the profile of psychopath who later follow all his colleagues with varied shades. In the final scene, Peter Lorre shakes the heart of any viewer with its final monologue, achieving a degree of empathy with the public Lang movie structured into three parts. The first shows the murderer and their consequences. The second shows the viewer the competition between law enforcement, criticized for their lack of results and criminals harassed by the police in their search for the murderer, to reach the same goal but with different methods. And in the third, which is the most daunting a merciless manhunt. Both the pace, as the narrative, as the assembly of this film have nothing to learn any modern Thriler. Its advances in sound are memorable and the ability to Lang framing or sticking out all the juice possible (with Arno Wagner) of black and white photography is extraordinary. Especially memorable are the great opening sequence and comparison established between cops and robbers.

    Hailed as Director Fritz Lang's finest not just by critics & fans alike but Lang himself, M is a brilliantly written & directed psychological thriller about a serial killer, played superbly by Peter Lorre, and presents an underworld society that, after police's continued failure in arresting the accused & causing raids everyday which leads to disruptions & losses in the underworld daily lives, takes matters in their own hands in capturing the serial killer themselves. Brimming with superb screenplay, wonderfully crafted suspense, satisfying performances, superb photography & painting a very unusual picture of criminals trying to capture another criminal & then talking about justice or law & order, M is a thought-provoking & well-researched study into the mind of a serial killer and about the morals of right & wrong as well as our own society.

    Listen here: http://moccast.blogspot.no/2013/05/episode-three-m.html A colleague of mine recently asked about 'that film that used to be on with Peter Lore'. I instantly replied 'M'; it wasn't some smug retort to show how film literate I was it, was because of the simple fact M is not shown on television anymore. Why? Well I dare say the answer may have something to do with the fact that despite being made in 1931 it is as shocking today as it was upon its original release. Indeed, M is one of the rare films to never lose its relevancy, to never cease asking the type of questions that society chooses to ignore. Fritz Lang didn't just make a film about a serial killer and a police investigation designed to thrill audiences, he made a film that probed areas of psychology and the world we live that wasn't just native to the films country Germany; but one that transcends national boundaries and more worryingly time. In this episode we delve into M share our thoughts on what makes it such an important addition to the Masters of Cinema collection. http://moccast.blogspot.no/2013/05/episode-three-m.html

    Fritz Lang has always been one of my favorites and so is his masterpiece M. almost any of Lang's films can be related to M in some way. Here, we have a chance to travel into the mind of a madman and maybe even our own mind, as the title of the film suggests. (murderers among us), something that resonates again in Lang's later films such as Fury (1936) In M, LANG brilliantly succeeds in creating an atmosphere of menace through the use of sound. There are moments of dead silence which is sometimes broken abruptly, creating a feeling of unease. Lang also shows influence from Murnau (particularly "the last laugh") in terms of camera movements. I never forget a scene in which camera goes up the wall and (then through the window), enters the room in which beggars are being organized it is interesting that the cooperation between thieves and beggars is effectively organized as each beggar even receives a personnel number Also unforgettable for me are the shots that show Elsie's absence; an empty chair, empty staircase and finally Elsie' ball moving on the bushes and her balloon that is released from telephone wires. Definitely a great success for Herr Lang for all its cinematic achievements

    Peter Lorre stars in "M," a 1931 German Expressionist film directed by Fritz Lang. I saw a restored version of this film -- apparently over the years it has been being pieced together when new sections are found. This ran 111 minutes. Lorre plays a child murderer (and probably molester, though that isn't stated) who is terrorizing a town in Germany and writing to the police and to the press. Believe it or not, with such a serious and daring subject, the film actually has some humor. When the police can't get the murderer, a group of burglars, angry at all the extra security and difficulties the murderer has caused them, decide they have to get him themselves. They round up beggars, who are everywhere and not noticed, and the burglars watch them. Each person is responsible for a section of the city. The acting is marvelous. Lorre is magnificent as a pathetic man who has a compulsion to kill. The other actors are wonderful as well. Due to the difference in acting styles today, the audience laughed in a couple of places that were not meant to be laughed at. That's understandable. The film has sections which are completely silent, with no music. The end of the film is a little abrupt, but nevertheless effective. This is a true masterpiece from the hand of Fritz Lang, who also co-wrote the script. The print was excellent as well, and the film is in German with English subtitles. It was important to see the newly found pieces of the film, though I'm not sure how much it added. Definitely a film to see with Peter Lorre's great performance that made him a star.

    The movie opens with couple of children playing in front of an apartment, and a mother setting table for lunch for her daughter, yet to return from school. Everything seems normal and that's when the spine chilling felonious character surfaces. We immediately learn that, there is a child murderer in the town and has already slay ed 8 children and the girl whose mother is waiting for lunch is the ninth victim. The town becomes unrest about the untamed psychopath, still at large. The Police in desperation start raiding every corner of the town. The sudden surge in Police activity is a bad news for local gangsters and crime syndicates, as these raids disturb their business. The bad guys of underworld arrange a clandestine meet to decide how to get rid of Police raids. Only way they find is to catch the pathological child killer, the police looking for. The syndicate puts every beggar in the town on the man hunt. Each street will be monitored by a beggar and he'll keep an eye on the every girl child in the street until she goes in to home or school or passes to the next street. The effort pays off. A blind man selling balloons, hears a man passing by whistling and he suddenly recalls that the tune was same from a man who purchased a balloon for school girl few weeks ago, and the same day the girl went missing. The killer already has tenth victim with him, lured by a candy. The vendor quickly alerts nearest beggar, and the beggar, in order to not to lose the murderer in the crowd, pretends to slip and clutches the killer for support and transfers onto the back on his shoulder a big 'M' that he previously chalked on his palm. The murderer is caught and is bought to a remote warehouse to face trial. The trial is conducted by the parents of the victims, beggars and the underworld syndicate who hatched the plan. The murderer kind of defends his actions complaining that he is driven by these uncontrollable evil urges and blames his mental condition for his actions and pleads, others do not understand what he is going through. Just when the jury is about to declare verdict, police arrive and take him into custody. The real trial begins as the movie ends with a mother saying ' no sentence would bring back the dead children, and One has to keep closer watch over the children." The screen goes black as she adds, "All of you'.

The town becomes unrest about the untamed psychopath, still at large. The Police in desperation start raiding every corner of the town. The sudden surge in Police activity is a bad news for local gangsters and crime syndicates, as these raids disturb their business. The bad guys of underworld arrange a clandestine meet to decide how to get rid of Police raids. Only way they find is to catch the pathological child killer, the police looking for. The syndicate puts every beggar in the town on the man hunt. Each street will be monitored by a beggar and he'll keep an eye on the every girl child in the street until she goes in to home or school or passes to the next street. The effort pays off. A blind man selling balloons, hears a man passing by whistling and he suddenly recalls that the tune was same from a man who purchased a balloon for school girl few weeks ago, and the same day the girl went missing. The killer already has tenth victim with him, lured by a candy. The vendor quickly alerts nearest beggar, and the beggar, in order to not to lose the murderer in the crowd, pretends to slip and clutches the killer for support and transfers onto the back on his shoulder a big 'M' that he previously chalked on his palm. The murderer is caught and is bought to a remote warehouse to face trial. The trial is conducted by the parents of the victims, beggars and the underworld syndicate who hatched the plan. The murderer kind of defends his actions complaining that he is driven by these uncontrollable evil urges and blames his mental condition for his actions and pleads, others do not understand what he is going through. Just when the jury is about to declare verdict, police arrive and take him into custody. The real trial begins as the movie ends with a mother saying ' no sentence would bring back the dead children, and One has to keep closer watch over the children." The screen goes black as she adds, "All of you'.

    It's difficult to believe this is the man's first sound film. I prefer "Das Testament des Dr. Mabuse" (1933) not only as entertainment but also as an epitome of the exploration of the marriage between sight and sound, but this brilliant, too. The way he ties images and sounds together in a delirious dance makes me feel like I am at the heart of a mystery being unravelled, a symphony unfolding. I know Lang himself considered himself as a "social" director tackling "social" issues. For me his strength lies elsewhere, that is, in the beautiful editing of visually strong images into visually strong narratives. And his use of sound strengthens this: it's quite a marvel to witness how some sounds anticipate certain images and certain images give way to certain sounds. This film is most certainly an inspiration for B&eacute;la Tarr's "Werckmeister harm&oacute;ni&aacute;k" (2000), and unsurprisingly Tarr voted this as one of the top ten films in the 2012 Sight & Sound poll. There's the same sense of societal paranoia that projects into the black-and-white frame, especially in the crowd scenes.

    Overlong for sure and with a rather abrupt ending, this remarkably suspense filled film, is quite spellbinding at points, able to view several facets of society and interweave a number of stories with great clarity. Peter Lorre gives an impassioned performance, playing a servile and repugnant child murderer, before finally giving a powerful speech rebuking his captors and supplying an emotional and sympathetic statement on his plight. His performance is so good, we understand his problems, and any murderous intent we once had is quickly drained. As an essay on justice, and its motivations, the film weaves in its themes with great skill, the director able to juggle, drama, suspense, and a very real message with remarkable impact. The cinematography is amazing, able to tell a story with its powerful image easily: a strong visual drama. And the directors ability to illuminate the room and create emotion with his images is also very good, creating a paranoid or claustrophobic atmosphere with ease. Music is used sparingly, and the taut silence of chases, is particularly good. The editing is amazing for a film of this age, and create good tense storytelling with both complexity and clarity. The film lags a little in places, and could be tightened up all round, to create a taut, powerful thriller. But otherwise it is strong all round, with great images, performances, and production.

    I can totally recognize how influential and ahead of its time Fritz Lang's M was, but I wasn't that impressed for the most part of the film unfortunately. First of all, the camera work is simply outstanding, having plenty of overhead shots as well as innovative techniques. I was quite surprised by how deep the story got in the last 15 minutes of the film, which led to a very powerful ending. The most interesting aspect here is the presence of a strong social criticism, demonstrated in the final discussions. Also, Peter Lorre was absolutely brilliant as Hans Beckert, the serial killer who murders children, making us believe how his heinous acts of violence are driven by this extreme compulsion within him. Now there are some things that bothered me. I felt the investigation scenes were too expository and overly stretched, making the film a little bloated. In addition, many scenes seemed to be sped up so that annoyed me a bit as they looked pretty unnatural. Finally, I didn't find any of the characters, apart from Hans Beckert, to be very interesting so that made it harder to get really engaged with the story sometimes. Overall, M is undoubtedly a revolutionary film and its ending was truly brilliant, but it had its bumps along the way.

    **1/2 out of **** Early German thriller from Fritz Lang ("Metropolis"), spotlighting a young Peter Lorre as a crazed child murderer. He selects innocent young girls and discreetly walks off with them, leaving the police force baffled as to trying to apprehend him and bring him to justice. So a concerned vigilante mob consisting of average citizens and hardened criminals take matters into their own hands in trying to catch the killer without interference from the law. My basic summation above sounds far more interesting than the way this overrated film plays out. I just re-watched this for my third (but final) time, on a Criterion DVD which offered the original German language version with English subtitles. The movie has a troubled history of having different prints at varying lengths, and this one was way overlong at around 109 minutes. I first saw M at the Film Forum in NYC, around the late 1990's. (It may have been a shorter English-dubbed version). At that time I recall being impressed at least with the intense ending, which highlights an emotional and sympathetic performance by Peter Lorre, where he is thrown at the mercy of a kangaroo court and actually pleads for the audience to consider his compulsions from his own warped perspective. It was based on that memory that I picked up the Criterion DVD release at the time it came out, which I may have spun maybe only one other time after I first bought it. However, I found this newest viewing to be dull and prolonged, with endless scenes of police procedures and discussions. Peter Lorre's screen time was precious little, and he only got to shine at the end for the last 15 minutes or so -- which was a good scene, but not worth enduring the rest of this tedium. There was not much in the way of "directorial flourishes". There are some nice suggestive visual setups at the opening to allude to Lorre's crimes, but that was about all. Just too much contemplating, searching, investigating, talking, meandering, to take up the most inflated guts of this film.

    A murderer of girls has frightened the entire city. The police are looking frantically, desperately, arresting anyone suspected. For other part, the leaders of the mob, angered by the raids that are suffering because of the murderer, they decide to seek their own It is the first film where a serial murderer appears, and without staying in the mere collection morbid murders the film makes a profound reflection on German society broken by war, economic instability, unemployment and crime. Fritz Lang got with "M" draw the profile of psychopath who later follow all his colleagues with varied shades. In the final scene, Peter Lorre shakes the heart of any viewer with its final monologue, achieving a degree of empathy with the public Lang movie structured into three parts. The first shows the murderer and their consequences. The second shows the viewer the competition between law enforcement, criticized for their lack of results and criminals harassed by the police in their search for the murderer, to reach the same goal but with different methods. And in the third, which is the most daunting a merciless manhunt. Both the pace, as the narrative, as the assembly of this film have nothing to learn any modern Thriler. Its advances in sound are memorable and the ability to Lang framing or sticking out all the juice possible (with Arno Wagner) of black and white photography is extraordinary. Especially memorable are the great opening sequence and comparison established between cops and robbers.

    Hailed as Director Fritz Lang's finest not just by critics & fans alike but Lang himself, M is a brilliantly written & directed psychological thriller about a serial killer, played superbly by Peter Lorre, and presents an underworld society that, after police's continued failure in arresting the accused & causing raids everyday which leads to disruptions & losses in the underworld daily lives, takes matters in their own hands in capturing the serial killer themselves. Brimming with superb screenplay, wonderfully crafted suspense, satisfying performances, superb photography & painting a very unusual picture of criminals trying to capture another criminal & then talking about justice or law & order, M is a thought-provoking & well-researched study into the mind of a serial killer and about the morals of right & wrong as well as our own society.

    Listen here: http://moccast.blogspot.no/2013/05/episode-three-m.html A colleague of mine recently asked about 'that film that used to be on with Peter Lore'. I instantly replied 'M'; it wasn't some smug retort to show how film literate I was it, was because of the simple fact M is not shown on television anymore. Why? Well I dare say the answer may have something to do with the fact that despite being made in 1931 it is as shocking today as it was upon its original release. Indeed, M is one of the rare films to never lose its relevancy, to never cease asking the type of questions that society chooses to ignore. Fritz Lang didn't just make a film about a serial killer and a police investigation designed to thrill audiences, he made a film that probed areas of psychology and the world we live that wasn't just native to the films country Germany; but one that transcends national boundaries and more worryingly time. In this episode we delve into M share our thoughts on what makes it such an important addition to the Masters of Cinema collection. http://moccast.blogspot.no/2013/05/episode-three-m.html

    Fritz Lang has always been one of my favorites and so is his masterpiece M. almost any of Lang's films can be related to M in some way. Here, we have a chance to travel into the mind of a madman and maybe even our own mind, as the title of the film suggests. (murderers among us), something that resonates again in Lang's later films such as Fury (1936) In M, LANG brilliantly succeeds in creating an atmosphere of menace through the use of sound. There are moments of dead silence which is sometimes broken abruptly, creating a feeling of unease. Lang also shows influence from Murnau (particularly "the last laugh") in terms of camera movements. I never forget a scene in which camera goes up the wall and (then through the window), enters the room in which beggars are being organized it is interesting that the cooperation between thieves and beggars is effectively organized as each beggar even receives a personnel number Also unforgettable for me are the shots that show Elsie's absence; an empty chair, empty staircase and finally Elsie' ball moving on the bushes and her balloon that is released from telephone wires. Definitely a great success for Herr Lang for all its cinematic achievements

    Peter Lorre stars in "M," a 1931 German Expressionist film directed by Fritz Lang. I saw a restored version of this film -- apparently over the years it has been being pieced together when new sections are found. This ran 111 minutes. Lorre plays a child murderer (and probably molester, though that isn't stated) who is terrorizing a town in Germany and writing to the police and to the press. Believe it or not, with such a serious and daring subject, the film actually has some humor. When the police can't get the murderer, a group of burglars, angry at all the extra security and difficulties the murderer has caused them, decide they have to get him themselves. They round up beggars, who are everywhere and not noticed, and the burglars watch them. Each person is responsible for a section of the city. The acting is marvelous. Lorre is magnificent as a pathetic man who has a compulsion to kill. The other actors are wonderful as well. Due to the difference in acting styles today, the audience laughed in a couple of places that were not meant to be laughed at. That's understandable. The film has sections which are completely silent, with no music. The end of the film is a little abrupt, but nevertheless effective. This is a true masterpiece from the hand of Fritz Lang, who also co-wrote the script. The print was excellent as well, and the film is in German with English subtitles. It was important to see the newly found pieces of the film, though I'm not sure how much it added. Definitely a film to see with Peter Lorre's great performance that made him a star.

Lorre is magnificent as a pathetic man who has a compulsion to kill. The other actors are wonderful as well. Due to the difference in acting styles today, the audience laughed in a couple of places that were not meant to be laughed at. That's understandable. The film has sections which are completely silent, with no music. The end of the film is a little abrupt, but nevertheless effective. This is a true masterpiece from the hand of Fritz Lang, who also co-wrote the script. The print was excellent as well, and the film is in German with English subtitles. It was important to see the newly found pieces of the film, though I'm not sure how much it added. Definitely a film to see with Peter Lorre's great performance that made him a star.

    The movie opens with couple of children playing in front of an apartment, and a mother setting table for lunch for her daughter, yet to return from school. Everything seems normal and that's when the spine chilling felonious character surfaces. We immediately learn that, there is a child murderer in the town and has already slay ed 8 children and the girl whose mother is waiting for lunch is the ninth victim. The town becomes unrest about the untamed psychopath, still at large. The Police in desperation start raiding every corner of the town. The sudden surge in Police activity is a bad news for local gangsters and crime syndicates, as these raids disturb their business. The bad guys of underworld arrange a clandestine meet to decide how to get rid of Police raids. Only way they find is to catch the pathological child killer, the police looking for. The syndicate puts every beggar in the town on the man hunt. Each street will be monitored by a beggar and he'll keep an eye on the every girl child in the street until she goes in to home or school or passes to the next street. The effort pays off. A blind man selling balloons, hears a man passing by whistling and he suddenly recalls that the tune was same from a man who purchased a balloon for school girl few weeks ago, and the same day the girl went missing. The killer already has tenth victim with him, lured by a candy. The vendor quickly alerts nearest beggar, and the beggar, in order to not to lose the murderer in the crowd, pretends to slip and clutches the killer for support and transfers onto the back on his shoulder a big 'M' that he previously chalked on his palm. The murderer is caught and is bought to a remote warehouse to face trial. The trial is conducted by the parents of the victims, beggars and the underworld syndicate who hatched the plan. The murderer kind of defends his actions complaining that he is driven by these uncontrollable evil urges and blames his mental condition for his actions and pleads, others do not understand what he is going through. Just when the jury is about to declare verdict, police arrive and take him into custody. The real trial begins as the movie ends with a mother saying ' no sentence would bring back the dead children, and One has to keep closer watch over the children." The screen goes black as she adds, "All of you'.

    It's difficult to believe this is the man's first sound film. I prefer "Das Testament des Dr. Mabuse" (1933) not only as entertainment but also as an epitome of the exploration of the marriage between sight and sound, but this brilliant, too. The way he ties images and sounds together in a delirious dance makes me feel like I am at the heart of a mystery being unravelled, a symphony unfolding. I know Lang himself considered himself as a "social" director tackling "social" issues. For me his strength lies elsewhere, that is, in the beautiful editing of visually strong images into visually strong narratives. And his use of sound strengthens this: it's quite a marvel to witness how some sounds anticipate certain images and certain images give way to certain sounds. This film is most certainly an inspiration for B&eacute;la Tarr's "Werckmeister harm&oacute;ni&aacute;k" (2000), and unsurprisingly Tarr voted this as one of the top ten films in the 2012 Sight & Sound poll. There's the same sense of societal paranoia that projects into the black-and-white frame, especially in the crowd scenes.

    Overlong for sure and with a rather abrupt ending, this remarkably suspense filled film, is quite spellbinding at points, able to view several facets of society and interweave a number of stories with great clarity. Peter Lorre gives an impassioned performance, playing a servile and repugnant child murderer, before finally giving a powerful speech rebuking his captors and supplying an emotional and sympathetic statement on his plight. His performance is so good, we understand his problems, and any murderous intent we once had is quickly drained. As an essay on justice, and its motivations, the film weaves in its themes with great skill, the director able to juggle, drama, suspense, and a very real message with remarkable impact. The cinematography is amazing, able to tell a story with its powerful image easily: a strong visual drama. And the directors ability to illuminate the room and create emotion with his images is also very good, creating a paranoid or claustrophobic atmosphere with ease. Music is used sparingly, and the taut silence of chases, is particularly good. The editing is amazing for a film of this age, and create good tense storytelling with both complexity and clarity. The film lags a little in places, and could be tightened up all round, to create a taut, powerful thriller. But otherwise it is strong all round, with great images, performances, and production.

    I can totally recognize how influential and ahead of its time Fritz Lang's M was, but I wasn't that impressed for the most part of the film unfortunately. First of all, the camera work is simply outstanding, having plenty of overhead shots as well as innovative techniques. I was quite surprised by how deep the story got in the last 15 minutes of the film, which led to a very powerful ending. The most interesting aspect here is the presence of a strong social criticism, demonstrated in the final discussions. Also, Peter Lorre was absolutely brilliant as Hans Beckert, the serial killer who murders children, making us believe how his heinous acts of violence are driven by this extreme compulsion within him. Now there are some things that bothered me. I felt the investigation scenes were too expository and overly stretched, making the film a little bloated. In addition, many scenes seemed to be sped up so that annoyed me a bit as they looked pretty unnatural. Finally, I didn't find any of the characters, apart from Hans Beckert, to be very interesting so that made it harder to get really engaged with the story sometimes. Overall, M is undoubtedly a revolutionary film and its ending was truly brilliant, but it had its bumps along the way.

    **1/2 out of **** Early German thriller from Fritz Lang ("Metropolis"), spotlighting a young Peter Lorre as a crazed child murderer. He selects innocent young girls and discreetly walks off with them, leaving the police force baffled as to trying to apprehend him and bring him to justice. So a concerned vigilante mob consisting of average citizens and hardened criminals take matters into their own hands in trying to catch the killer without interference from the law. My basic summation above sounds far more interesting than the way this overrated film plays out. I just re-watched this for my third (but final) time, on a Criterion DVD which offered the original German language version with English subtitles. The movie has a troubled history of having different prints at varying lengths, and this one was way overlong at around 109 minutes. I first saw M at the Film Forum in NYC, around the late 1990's. (It may have been a shorter English-dubbed version). At that time I recall being impressed at least with the intense ending, which highlights an emotional and sympathetic performance by Peter Lorre, where he is thrown at the mercy of a kangaroo court and actually pleads for the audience to consider his compulsions from his own warped perspective. It was based on that memory that I picked up the Criterion DVD release at the time it came out, which I may have spun maybe only one other time after I first bought it. However, I found this newest viewing to be dull and prolonged, with endless scenes of police procedures and discussions. Peter Lorre's screen time was precious little, and he only got to shine at the end for the last 15 minutes or so -- which was a good scene, but not worth enduring the rest of this tedium. There was not much in the way of "directorial flourishes". There are some nice suggestive visual setups at the opening to allude to Lorre's crimes, but that was about all. Just too much contemplating, searching, investigating, talking, meandering, to take up the most inflated guts of this film.

    A murderer of girls has frightened the entire city. The police are looking frantically, desperately, arresting anyone suspected. For other part, the leaders of the mob, angered by the raids that are suffering because of the murderer, they decide to seek their own It is the first film where a serial murderer appears, and without staying in the mere collection morbid murders the film makes a profound reflection on German society broken by war, economic instability, unemployment and crime. Fritz Lang got with "M" draw the profile of psychopath who later follow all his colleagues with varied shades. In the final scene, Peter Lorre shakes the heart of any viewer with its final monologue, achieving a degree of empathy with the public Lang movie structured into three parts. The first shows the murderer and their consequences. The second shows the viewer the competition between law enforcement, criticized for their lack of results and criminals harassed by the police in their search for the murderer, to reach the same goal but with different methods. And in the third, which is the most daunting a merciless manhunt. Both the pace, as the narrative, as the assembly of this film have nothing to learn any modern Thriler. Its advances in sound are memorable and the ability to Lang framing or sticking out all the juice possible (with Arno Wagner) of black and white photography is extraordinary. Especially memorable are the great opening sequence and comparison established between cops and robbers.

    Hailed as Director Fritz Lang's finest not just by critics & fans alike but Lang himself, M is a brilliantly written & directed psychological thriller about a serial killer, played superbly by Peter Lorre, and presents an underworld society that, after police's continued failure in arresting the accused & causing raids everyday which leads to disruptions & losses in the underworld daily lives, takes matters in their own hands in capturing the serial killer themselves. Brimming with superb screenplay, wonderfully crafted suspense, satisfying performances, superb photography & painting a very unusual picture of criminals trying to capture another criminal & then talking about justice or law & order, M is a thought-provoking & well-researched study into the mind of a serial killer and about the morals of right & wrong as well as our own society.

    Listen here: http://moccast.blogspot.no/2013/05/episode-three-m.html A colleague of mine recently asked about 'that film that used to be on with Peter Lore'. I instantly replied 'M'; it wasn't some smug retort to show how film literate I was it, was because of the simple fact M is not shown on television anymore. Why? Well I dare say the answer may have something to do with the fact that despite being made in 1931 it is as shocking today as it was upon its original release. Indeed, M is one of the rare films to never lose its relevancy, to never cease asking the type of questions that society chooses to ignore. Fritz Lang didn't just make a film about a serial killer and a police investigation designed to thrill audiences, he made a film that probed areas of psychology and the world we live that wasn't just native to the films country Germany; but one that transcends national boundaries and more worryingly time. In this episode we delve into M share our thoughts on what makes it such an important addition to the Masters of Cinema collection. http://moccast.blogspot.no/2013/05/episode-three-m.html

    Fritz Lang has always been one of my favorites and so is his masterpiece M. almost any of Lang's films can be related to M in some way. Here, we have a chance to travel into the mind of a madman and maybe even our own mind, as the title of the film suggests. (murderers among us), something that resonates again in Lang's later films such as Fury (1936) In M, LANG brilliantly succeeds in creating an atmosphere of menace through the use of sound. There are moments of dead silence which is sometimes broken abruptly, creating a feeling of unease. Lang also shows influence from Murnau (particularly "the last laugh") in terms of camera movements. I never forget a scene in which camera goes up the wall and (then through the window), enters the room in which beggars are being organized it is interesting that the cooperation between thieves and beggars is effectively organized as each beggar even receives a personnel number Also unforgettable for me are the shots that show Elsie's absence; an empty chair, empty staircase and finally Elsie' ball moving on the bushes and her balloon that is released from telephone wires. Definitely a great success for Herr Lang for all its cinematic achievements

    Peter Lorre stars in "M," a 1931 German Expressionist film directed by Fritz Lang. I saw a restored version of this film -- apparently over the years it has been being pieced together when new sections are found. This ran 111 minutes. Lorre plays a child murderer (and probably molester, though that isn't stated) who is terrorizing a town in Germany and writing to the police and to the press. Believe it or not, with such a serious and daring subject, the film actually has some humor. When the police can't get the murderer, a group of burglars, angry at all the extra security and difficulties the murderer has caused them, decide they have to get him themselves. They round up beggars, who are everywhere and not noticed, and the burglars watch them. Each person is responsible for a section of the city. The acting is marvelous. Lorre is magnificent as a pathetic man who has a compulsion to kill. The other actors are wonderful as well. Due to the difference in acting styles today, the audience laughed in a couple of places that were not meant to be laughed at. That's understandable. The film has sections which are completely silent, with no music. The end of the film is a little abrupt, but nevertheless effective. This is a true masterpiece from the hand of Fritz Lang, who also co-wrote the script. The print was excellent as well, and the film is in German with English subtitles. It was important to see the newly found pieces of the film, though I'm not sure how much it added. Definitely a film to see with Peter Lorre's great performance that made him a star.

I never forget a scene in which camera goes up the wall and (then through the window), enters the room in which beggars are being organized it is interesting that the cooperation between thieves and beggars is effectively organized as each beggar even receives a personnel number Also unforgettable for me are the shots that show Elsie's absence; an empty chair, empty staircase and finally Elsie' ball moving on the bushes and her balloon that is released from telephone wires. Definitely a great success for Herr Lang for all its cinematic achievements

    Peter Lorre stars in "M," a 1931 German Expressionist film directed by Fritz Lang. I saw a restored version of this film -- apparently over the years it has been being pieced together when new sections are found. This ran 111 minutes. Lorre plays a child murderer (and probably molester, though that isn't stated) who is terrorizing a town in Germany and writing to the police and to the press. Believe it or not, with such a serious and daring subject, the film actually has some humor. When the police can't get the murderer, a group of burglars, angry at all the extra security and difficulties the murderer has caused them, decide they have to get him themselves. They round up beggars, who are everywhere and not noticed, and the burglars watch them. Each person is responsible for a section of the city. The acting is marvelous. Lorre is magnificent as a pathetic man who has a compulsion to kill. The other actors are wonderful as well. Due to the difference in acting styles today, the audience laughed in a couple of places that were not meant to be laughed at. That's understandable. The film has sections which are completely silent, with no music. The end of the film is a little abrupt, but nevertheless effective. This is a true masterpiece from the hand of Fritz Lang, who also co-wrote the script. The print was excellent as well, and the film is in German with English subtitles. It was important to see the newly found pieces of the film, though I'm not sure how much it added. Definitely a film to see with Peter Lorre's great performance that made him a star.

    The movie opens with couple of children playing in front of an apartment, and a mother setting table for lunch for her daughter, yet to return from school. Everything seems normal and that's when the spine chilling felonious character surfaces. We immediately learn that, there is a child murderer in the town and has already slay ed 8 children and the girl whose mother is waiting for lunch is the ninth victim. The town becomes unrest about the untamed psychopath, still at large. The Police in desperation start raiding every corner of the town. The sudden surge in Police activity is a bad news for local gangsters and crime syndicates, as these raids disturb their business. The bad guys of underworld arrange a clandestine meet to decide how to get rid of Police raids. Only way they find is to catch the pathological child killer, the police looking for. The syndicate puts every beggar in the town on the man hunt. Each street will be monitored by a beggar and he'll keep an eye on the every girl child in the street until she goes in to home or school or passes to the next street. The effort pays off. A blind man selling balloons, hears a man passing by whistling and he suddenly recalls that the tune was same from a man who purchased a balloon for school girl few weeks ago, and the same day the girl went missing. The killer already has tenth victim with him, lured by a candy. The vendor quickly alerts nearest beggar, and the beggar, in order to not to lose the murderer in the crowd, pretends to slip and clutches the killer for support and transfers onto the back on his shoulder a big 'M' that he previously chalked on his palm. The murderer is caught and is bought to a remote warehouse to face trial. The trial is conducted by the parents of the victims, beggars and the underworld syndicate who hatched the plan. The murderer kind of defends his actions complaining that he is driven by these uncontrollable evil urges and blames his mental condition for his actions and pleads, others do not understand what he is going through. Just when the jury is about to declare verdict, police arrive and take him into custody. The real trial begins as the movie ends with a mother saying ' no sentence would bring back the dead children, and One has to keep closer watch over the children." The screen goes black as she adds, "All of you'.

    It's difficult to believe this is the man's first sound film. I prefer "Das Testament des Dr. Mabuse" (1933) not only as entertainment but also as an epitome of the exploration of the marriage between sight and sound, but this brilliant, too. The way he ties images and sounds together in a delirious dance makes me feel like I am at the heart of a mystery being unravelled, a symphony unfolding. I know Lang himself considered himself as a "social" director tackling "social" issues. For me his strength lies elsewhere, that is, in the beautiful editing of visually strong images into visually strong narratives. And his use of sound strengthens this: it's quite a marvel to witness how some sounds anticipate certain images and certain images give way to certain sounds. This film is most certainly an inspiration for B&eacute;la Tarr's "Werckmeister harm&oacute;ni&aacute;k" (2000), and unsurprisingly Tarr voted this as one of the top ten films in the 2012 Sight & Sound poll. There's the same sense of societal paranoia that projects into the black-and-white frame, especially in the crowd scenes.

    Overlong for sure and with a rather abrupt ending, this remarkably suspense filled film, is quite spellbinding at points, able to view several facets of society and interweave a number of stories with great clarity. Peter Lorre gives an impassioned performance, playing a servile and repugnant child murderer, before finally giving a powerful speech rebuking his captors and supplying an emotional and sympathetic statement on his plight. His performance is so good, we understand his problems, and any murderous intent we once had is quickly drained. As an essay on justice, and its motivations, the film weaves in its themes with great skill, the director able to juggle, drama, suspense, and a very real message with remarkable impact. The cinematography is amazing, able to tell a story with its powerful image easily: a strong visual drama. And the directors ability to illuminate the room and create emotion with his images is also very good, creating a paranoid or claustrophobic atmosphere with ease. Music is used sparingly, and the taut silence of chases, is particularly good. The editing is amazing for a film of this age, and create good tense storytelling with both complexity and clarity. The film lags a little in places, and could be tightened up all round, to create a taut, powerful thriller. But otherwise it is strong all round, with great images, performances, and production.

    I can totally recognize how influential and ahead of its time Fritz Lang's M was, but I wasn't that impressed for the most part of the film unfortunately. First of all, the camera work is simply outstanding, having plenty of overhead shots as well as innovative techniques. I was quite surprised by how deep the story got in the last 15 minutes of the film, which led to a very powerful ending. The most interesting aspect here is the presence of a strong social criticism, demonstrated in the final discussions. Also, Peter Lorre was absolutely brilliant as Hans Beckert, the serial killer who murders children, making us believe how his heinous acts of violence are driven by this extreme compulsion within him. Now there are some things that bothered me. I felt the investigation scenes were too expository and overly stretched, making the film a little bloated. In addition, many scenes seemed to be sped up so that annoyed me a bit as they looked pretty unnatural. Finally, I didn't find any of the characters, apart from Hans Beckert, to be very interesting so that made it harder to get really engaged with the story sometimes. Overall, M is undoubtedly a revolutionary film and its ending was truly brilliant, but it had its bumps along the way.

    **1/2 out of **** Early German thriller from Fritz Lang ("Metropolis"), spotlighting a young Peter Lorre as a crazed child murderer. He selects innocent young girls and discreetly walks off with them, leaving the police force baffled as to trying to apprehend him and bring him to justice. So a concerned vigilante mob consisting of average citizens and hardened criminals take matters into their own hands in trying to catch the killer without interference from the law. My basic summation above sounds far more interesting than the way this overrated film plays out. I just re-watched this for my third (but final) time, on a Criterion DVD which offered the original German language version with English subtitles. The movie has a troubled history of having different prints at varying lengths, and this one was way overlong at around 109 minutes. I first saw M at the Film Forum in NYC, around the late 1990's. (It may have been a shorter English-dubbed version). At that time I recall being impressed at least with the intense ending, which highlights an emotional and sympathetic performance by Peter Lorre, where he is thrown at the mercy of a kangaroo court and actually pleads for the audience to consider his compulsions from his own warped perspective. It was based on that memory that I picked up the Criterion DVD release at the time it came out, which I may have spun maybe only one other time after I first bought it. However, I found this newest viewing to be dull and prolonged, with endless scenes of police procedures and discussions. Peter Lorre's screen time was precious little, and he only got to shine at the end for the last 15 minutes or so -- which was a good scene, but not worth enduring the rest of this tedium. There was not much in the way of "directorial flourishes". There are some nice suggestive visual setups at the opening to allude to Lorre's crimes, but that was about all. Just too much contemplating, searching, investigating, talking, meandering, to take up the most inflated guts of this film.

    A murderer of girls has frightened the entire city. The police are looking frantically, desperately, arresting anyone suspected. For other part, the leaders of the mob, angered by the raids that are suffering because of the murderer, they decide to seek their own It is the first film where a serial murderer appears, and without staying in the mere collection morbid murders the film makes a profound reflection on German society broken by war, economic instability, unemployment and crime. Fritz Lang got with "M" draw the profile of psychopath who later follow all his colleagues with varied shades. In the final scene, Peter Lorre shakes the heart of any viewer with its final monologue, achieving a degree of empathy with the public Lang movie structured into three parts. The first shows the murderer and their consequences. The second shows the viewer the competition between law enforcement, criticized for their lack of results and criminals harassed by the police in their search for the murderer, to reach the same goal but with different methods. And in the third, which is the most daunting a merciless manhunt. Both the pace, as the narrative, as the assembly of this film have nothing to learn any modern Thriler. Its advances in sound are memorable and the ability to Lang framing or sticking out all the juice possible (with Arno Wagner) of black and white photography is extraordinary. Especially memorable are the great opening sequence and comparison established between cops and robbers.

    Hailed as Director Fritz Lang's finest not just by critics & fans alike but Lang himself, M is a brilliantly written & directed psychological thriller about a serial killer, played superbly by Peter Lorre, and presents an underworld society that, after police's continued failure in arresting the accused & causing raids everyday which leads to disruptions & losses in the underworld daily lives, takes matters in their own hands in capturing the serial killer themselves. Brimming with superb screenplay, wonderfully crafted suspense, satisfying performances, superb photography & painting a very unusual picture of criminals trying to capture another criminal & then talking about justice or law & order, M is a thought-provoking & well-researched study into the mind of a serial killer and about the morals of right & wrong as well as our own society.

    Listen here: http://moccast.blogspot.no/2013/05/episode-three-m.html A colleague of mine recently asked about 'that film that used to be on with Peter Lore'. I instantly replied 'M'; it wasn't some smug retort to show how film literate I was it, was because of the simple fact M is not shown on television anymore. Why? Well I dare say the answer may have something to do with the fact that despite being made in 1931 it is as shocking today as it was upon its original release. Indeed, M is one of the rare films to never lose its relevancy, to never cease asking the type of questions that society chooses to ignore. Fritz Lang didn't just make a film about a serial killer and a police investigation designed to thrill audiences, he made a film that probed areas of psychology and the world we live that wasn't just native to the films country Germany; but one that transcends national boundaries and more worryingly time. In this episode we delve into M share our thoughts on what makes it such an important addition to the Masters of Cinema collection. http://moccast.blogspot.no/2013/05/episode-three-m.html

    Fritz Lang has always been one of my favorites and so is his masterpiece M. almost any of Lang's films can be related to M in some way. Here, we have a chance to travel into the mind of a madman and maybe even our own mind, as the title of the film suggests. (murderers among us), something that resonates again in Lang's later films such as Fury (1936) In M, LANG brilliantly succeeds in creating an atmosphere of menace through the use of sound. There are moments of dead silence which is sometimes broken abruptly, creating a feeling of unease. Lang also shows influence from Murnau (particularly "the last laugh") in terms of camera movements. I never forget a scene in which camera goes up the wall and (then through the window), enters the room in which beggars are being organized it is interesting that the cooperation between thieves and beggars is effectively organized as each beggar even receives a personnel number Also unforgettable for me are the shots that show Elsie's absence; an empty chair, empty staircase and finally Elsie' ball moving on the bushes and her balloon that is released from telephone wires. Definitely a great success for Herr Lang for all its cinematic achievements

Fritz Lang didn't just make a film about a serial killer and a police investigation designed to thrill audiences, he made a film that probed areas of psychology and the world we live that wasn't just native to the films country Germany; but one that transcends national boundaries and more worryingly time. In this episode we delve into M share our thoughts on what makes it such an important addition to the Masters of Cinema collection. http://moccast.blogspot.no/2013/05/episode-three-m.html

    Fritz Lang has always been one of my favorites and so is his masterpiece M. almost any of Lang's films can be related to M in some way. Here, we have a chance to travel into the mind of a madman and maybe even our own mind, as the title of the film suggests. (murderers among us), something that resonates again in Lang's later films such as Fury (1936) In M, LANG brilliantly succeeds in creating an atmosphere of menace through the use of sound. There are moments of dead silence which is sometimes broken abruptly, creating a feeling of unease. Lang also shows influence from Murnau (particularly "the last laugh") in terms of camera movements. I never forget a scene in which camera goes up the wall and (then through the window), enters the room in which beggars are being organized it is interesting that the cooperation between thieves and beggars is effectively organized as each beggar even receives a personnel number Also unforgettable for me are the shots that show Elsie's absence; an empty chair, empty staircase and finally Elsie' ball moving on the bushes and her balloon that is released from telephone wires. Definitely a great success for Herr Lang for all its cinematic achievements

    Peter Lorre stars in "M," a 1931 German Expressionist film directed by Fritz Lang. I saw a restored version of this film -- apparently over the years it has been being pieced together when new sections are found. This ran 111 minutes. Lorre plays a child murderer (and probably molester, though that isn't stated) who is terrorizing a town in Germany and writing to the police and to the press. Believe it or not, with such a serious and daring subject, the film actually has some humor. When the police can't get the murderer, a group of burglars, angry at all the extra security and difficulties the murderer has caused them, decide they have to get him themselves. They round up beggars, who are everywhere and not noticed, and the burglars watch them. Each person is responsible for a section of the city. The acting is marvelous. Lorre is magnificent as a pathetic man who has a compulsion to kill. The other actors are wonderful as well. Due to the difference in acting styles today, the audience laughed in a couple of places that were not meant to be laughed at. That's understandable. The film has sections which are completely silent, with no music. The end of the film is a little abrupt, but nevertheless effective. This is a true masterpiece from the hand of Fritz Lang, who also co-wrote the script. The print was excellent as well, and the film is in German with English subtitles. It was important to see the newly found pieces of the film, though I'm not sure how much it added. Definitely a film to see with Peter Lorre's great performance that made him a star.

    The movie opens with couple of children playing in front of an apartment, and a mother setting table for lunch for her daughter, yet to return from school. Everything seems normal and that's when the spine chilling felonious character surfaces. We immediately learn that, there is a child murderer in the town and has already slay ed 8 children and the girl whose mother is waiting for lunch is the ninth victim. The town becomes unrest about the untamed psychopath, still at large. The Police in desperation start raiding every corner of the town. The sudden surge in Police activity is a bad news for local gangsters and crime syndicates, as these raids disturb their business. The bad guys of underworld arrange a clandestine meet to decide how to get rid of Police raids. Only way they find is to catch the pathological child killer, the police looking for. The syndicate puts every beggar in the town on the man hunt. Each street will be monitored by a beggar and he'll keep an eye on the every girl child in the street until she goes in to home or school or passes to the next street. The effort pays off. A blind man selling balloons, hears a man passing by whistling and he suddenly recalls that the tune was same from a man who purchased a balloon for school girl few weeks ago, and the same day the girl went missing. The killer already has tenth victim with him, lured by a candy. The vendor quickly alerts nearest beggar, and the beggar, in order to not to lose the murderer in the crowd, pretends to slip and clutches the killer for support and transfers onto the back on his shoulder a big 'M' that he previously chalked on his palm. The murderer is caught and is bought to a remote warehouse to face trial. The trial is conducted by the parents of the victims, beggars and the underworld syndicate who hatched the plan. The murderer kind of defends his actions complaining that he is driven by these uncontrollable evil urges and blames his mental condition for his actions and pleads, others do not understand what he is going through. Just when the jury is about to declare verdict, police arrive and take him into custody. The real trial begins as the movie ends with a mother saying ' no sentence would bring back the dead children, and One has to keep closer watch over the children." The screen goes black as she adds, "All of you'.

    It's difficult to believe this is the man's first sound film. I prefer "Das Testament des Dr. Mabuse" (1933) not only as entertainment but also as an epitome of the exploration of the marriage between sight and sound, but this brilliant, too. The way he ties images and sounds together in a delirious dance makes me feel like I am at the heart of a mystery being unravelled, a symphony unfolding. I know Lang himself considered himself as a "social" director tackling "social" issues. For me his strength lies elsewhere, that is, in the beautiful editing of visually strong images into visually strong narratives. And his use of sound strengthens this: it's quite a marvel to witness how some sounds anticipate certain images and certain images give way to certain sounds. This film is most certainly an inspiration for B&eacute;la Tarr's "Werckmeister harm&oacute;ni&aacute;k" (2000), and unsurprisingly Tarr voted this as one of the top ten films in the 2012 Sight & Sound poll. There's the same sense of societal paranoia that projects into the black-and-white frame, especially in the crowd scenes.

    Overlong for sure and with a rather abrupt ending, this remarkably suspense filled film, is quite spellbinding at points, able to view several facets of society and interweave a number of stories with great clarity. Peter Lorre gives an impassioned performance, playing a servile and repugnant child murderer, before finally giving a powerful speech rebuking his captors and supplying an emotional and sympathetic statement on his plight. His performance is so good, we understand his problems, and any murderous intent we once had is quickly drained. As an essay on justice, and its motivations, the film weaves in its themes with great skill, the director able to juggle, drama, suspense, and a very real message with remarkable impact. The cinematography is amazing, able to tell a story with its powerful image easily: a strong visual drama. And the directors ability to illuminate the room and create emotion with his images is also very good, creating a paranoid or claustrophobic atmosphere with ease. Music is used sparingly, and the taut silence of chases, is particularly good. The editing is amazing for a film of this age, and create good tense storytelling with both complexity and clarity. The film lags a little in places, and could be tightened up all round, to create a taut, powerful thriller. But otherwise it is strong all round, with great images, performances, and production.
