    People this show is for kids, your taking it to seriously. I use to beg my dad to rent this movie on VHS when is was like 6 or 8 and now I'm 20 and still love the movie as well as the books. Yes there is a book to this movie, and if you're the type of person that likes to read books based off a film or just likes fantasy, I'd suggest it. I understand the movie better now that I see some of the thoughts and reasoning behind the characters actions. Also, there are scenes from the book that are cut or shortened in the movie that should not have been. It would have helped the viewers understand it better. Anyways... I just recently got my 10 year old cousin with autism and my younger sister who is 8 to watch it.... and guess what. THEY BOTH LOVED IT! This show is great for younger kids because for one there is not any gore. The fight scenes are pretty amazing considering the time and budgit. And the villain can make you laugh at how insane he is! Plus, it's your typical good vs. evil story where the good guys win. If you're an adult you won't like the movie (maybe some do, myself included), the dialogue is corny, the movie comes across as rushed, the plot is predictable, and there will be parts in the movie where you will be like "What the heck?!" But the point is that this is a good movie for children and not a movie that adults should expect to be blow away by. I give this movie a solid 8.

    I watched "Warriors Of Virtue" with my 9 year old son a few nights ago, and I can only say that this is easily one of the worst films of any kind I have seen in my 50 plus years of avid film consumption. I enjoy kids movies, martial arts movies, action/adventure movies, fish-out-of-water movies, and just about any genre of film that "Warriors Of Virtue" could possibly belong to. Hell, I like a lot of just plain bad movies, but this was just dreadful. It may have been Shakespeare or perhaps Benny Hill who observed that comparisons are odious, but I couldn't help noticing the similarities between "Warriors Of Virtue" and your average episode of "Power Rangers"(my kid, god bless him, was a big fan in the first grade). Half-baked and tone-deaf in conception, amateurish in execution, I can imagine simpletons the world over drew figurative lines in the sand in solidarity over their collective objection to the use of the word simplistic to describe this film. Half-wits would look at "Warriors Of Virtue" and wonder just where in hell the money went. It certainly wasn't spent on developing a narrative that makes any sense, three-dimensional characters, professional acting, staging, or direction. "Warriors" was pre-CGI, so I can accept that the special effects work was corny, but...kangaroos? Seriously? This movie is resolutely and resoundingly grind-your-teeth-into-nubbins stupid.

    Warriors of Virtue is a rather strange movie, but I find it a great bore. While the idea of martial art marsupials seems goofy and stupid, but at least it would be entertaining. This movie, however, seems to have a consistency of dragging dialogues, confusing setups, and poor delivery. It takes forever for the action to start up, and when it does, the cinematography is unnecessary and often hard to make out. The very idea of the movie may sound silly, it had promise to at least be ridiculously entertaining, but the slow route it takes and the basic "nothingness" it envelopes kind of makes it not so much a good movie. However, the one thing that always brought me back to this film was the villain. The acting in the villain's case is just so over-the-top and enjoyably hilarious that he makes the film worth watching. Give him props because he was starred in other movies like "Titus."

    There are a lot of horrid, bad movies out there and there are a lot of unwatchable, boring movies out there. With this movie, we get the worst of both worlds. 1) The characters. The actual warriors have no real character; the movie has to list their personality traits! The kid himself is not interesting and the villain is just over-the-top goofy. 2) The visuals. The world of Tao (Actually pronounced "Dao") is nothing you haven't seen before and the puppetry is pitifully bad. Mouth movements by the warriors and others rarely match up with dialog. Fight scenes are simply unwatchable, with this weird frame-cutting technique. 3) The slug-like pace. If it wasn't for Mountain Dew, I would've fallen asleep numerous times. At least with films like Battlefield Earth, we get entertainment, even at the expense of the movie. Here, we don't have such luck.

    I stumbled upon this one basically by accident. While channel surfing at midnight, this came on, and saw an ordinary world kid in some pretty ancient looking forest, exploring it with a "where am I?" face, so I pretty much could tell this was some outsider boy who lives adventures in a fantasy world. If you haven't noticed from the mere cover of the movie, this is no Lord of the Rings. Even worse, it doesn't live up to cult classic fantasies like Krull, Willow or Dark Crystal. I'm a big fan of fantasy movies that deal with what I like to call "the outsider myth": some kid magically travels to a distant land and lives adventures (who wouldn't like to?), so I was left hypnotized with the potentially entertaining story and, (forgive me) the Elysia character. However, one of many flaws with this movie are the Warriors of Virtue themselves. They're kinda rat or kangaroo-looking people with great martial arts knowledge. Rather out of place for this type of fantasy, and when you see them in action, it just doesn't work. It's like watching sports mascots practicing kung fu. Much more laughable than exciting. This can be a turn off if you expected classic sword and sorcery swashbuckling, for instead, it delivers martial arts in flurry costumes. The sets are awful, with no variety. No exploration of this fantastic (sarcasm) land is ever done, and all you see is a forest, an evil palace lair, the same forest and huts on trees in (you guessed it) the forest. The main villain, one girly, over-the-top emperor, is both campy and not so evil. There appears to be a major battle to occur between his soldiers and the good guys, but no real sword fight ever occurs. Instead, you see more fluffy karate. The Evil Emperor inexplicably splits into five guys and fights all five warriors. If you thought that would be boring, they even show it in blurry vision, just another sign of the movie's inappropriately low budget. And by the end, the bad guy somehow has amnesia, forgets he was so cruel and joins the good guys (to make things even more yawn inducing). Like you could actually care. An underrated score by Don Davis helps the movie from falling completely into oblivion, but not an entirely new sound. The mythology might sound good, so maybe a remake some decades later could squeeze some more juice to the premise. But, until that happens, you can keep "Warriors of Virtue" on the shelf and pass it on.

    My kids were acting like little monsters, so I was going to just have them sit down and watch Spykids, but are DVD player wasn't working, so I turned on the VCR and made them watch a video from my best friends VHS collection. I never saw the movie before and neither did my kids it took about 20 mins before the kids realized how bad this movie truly was! I said, "fine don't watch", but then they were acting up again. So, I sat them on the couch and told them they are going to watch the whole movie, til dinner was ready. Lets just say from now on, when I really want to punish them, I put them in the basement and make them watch the movie as punishment. My kids have never been so well behaved.

    Alright, I admit going in that I was predisposed to dislike this movie. I have studied Taoism for many years, and I guess I don't take kindly to it being reduced down to a 90 minute family friendly event. Although it came highly recommended to me, I was put off by it's kid friendly approach to something as complex as Eastern Philosophy. Through out the film, I could not shake the vision I had of a Roos vs Turtles sequel. Although not as bad as I feared, this film looks for all the world like it was edited by a Cuisinart. The over extended climatic fight scene had so many different editing styles present that it nearly gave me an epileptic fit. Either that, or my digital TV is on the blink. I really cannot recommend this film to anybody except possible a few hard core gamers who would get off on the cartoon-like action sequences.

    This film is one of those forgotten 90s rip-offs from the Ninja Turtle fall out. It's easy to forget how insane the turtle craze was but it is also easy to forget that the original TMNT movie was actually pretty decent. Most of it's sequels and copies were not. Which brings us to this little gem... It's a film so bad it's good. The fight scenes are sloe-mo with wind-blown leaves for no reason other than effect. The warriors of virtue are kangaroos with martial art skills, they personify the virtues eg patience....and it's fight to the death between good and evil. All told it's a great movie for kids that the adults can enjoy while pretending to be too old for it.

    I absolutely adore this movie! It's a wonderful family film, it has a great storyline, and the fight sequences aren't all that bad. The only bad thing is when they slow the camera down slightly for effect (and that's not even terrible in itself). The characters are lovable, there are several quite funny parts, and it leaves you with a warm feeling in your heart. Warriors of Virtue is a masterpiece. PS - in case anyone didn't know, the poster at the top of the page is not the poster for this Warriors of Virtue movie. That's the poster for the other version, from either Japan or China (can't remember). The actual poster has Mario Yedidia on it. You can find it on Google :)

    Hokey over-sized Zen kangaroos using Buddhist philosophy and preposterous martial arts in cumbersome Halloween costumes (Who spray-painted the Barney outfit?) to defeat some demented creep in eye-liner while yakking interminably about virtue and Taoist theology. Short on warriors, shorter on virtue, the potty-mouth dialogue is anything but virtuous, especially in the scripted lines written for 12-year-olds. (Make that "by 12-year-olds".) This turkey ranks with "The Neverending Story"...minus the "story". I'll bet the studios are still looking for the guy that took them on this one. On your deathbed, you'll wish you had this 103 minutes back. If you haven't yet wasted your time on this bomb, repent of the notion while there's hope. Ralph Macchio should be thankful he was too old to be caught in the kid's role. Who writes this stuff???

This show is great for younger kids because for one there is not any gore. The fight scenes are pretty amazing considering the time and budgit. And the villain can make you laugh at how insane he is! Plus, it's your typical good vs. evil story where the good guys win. If you're an adult you won't like the movie (maybe some do, myself included), the dialogue is corny, the movie comes across as rushed, the plot is predictable, and there will be parts in the movie where you will be like "What the heck?!" But the point is that this is a good movie for children and not a movie that adults should expect to be blow away by. I give this movie a solid 8.

    I watched "Warriors Of Virtue" with my 9 year old son a few nights ago, and I can only say that this is easily one of the worst films of any kind I have seen in my 50 plus years of avid film consumption. I enjoy kids movies, martial arts movies, action/adventure movies, fish-out-of-water movies, and just about any genre of film that "Warriors Of Virtue" could possibly belong to. Hell, I like a lot of just plain bad movies, but this was just dreadful. It may have been Shakespeare or perhaps Benny Hill who observed that comparisons are odious, but I couldn't help noticing the similarities between "Warriors Of Virtue" and your average episode of "Power Rangers"(my kid, god bless him, was a big fan in the first grade). Half-baked and tone-deaf in conception, amateurish in execution, I can imagine simpletons the world over drew figurative lines in the sand in solidarity over their collective objection to the use of the word simplistic to describe this film. Half-wits would look at "Warriors Of Virtue" and wonder just where in hell the money went. It certainly wasn't spent on developing a narrative that makes any sense, three-dimensional characters, professional acting, staging, or direction. "Warriors" was pre-CGI, so I can accept that the special effects work was corny, but...kangaroos? Seriously? This movie is resolutely and resoundingly grind-your-teeth-into-nubbins stupid.

    Warriors of Virtue is a rather strange movie, but I find it a great bore. While the idea of martial art marsupials seems goofy and stupid, but at least it would be entertaining. This movie, however, seems to have a consistency of dragging dialogues, confusing setups, and poor delivery. It takes forever for the action to start up, and when it does, the cinematography is unnecessary and often hard to make out. The very idea of the movie may sound silly, it had promise to at least be ridiculously entertaining, but the slow route it takes and the basic "nothingness" it envelopes kind of makes it not so much a good movie. However, the one thing that always brought me back to this film was the villain. The acting in the villain's case is just so over-the-top and enjoyably hilarious that he makes the film worth watching. Give him props because he was starred in other movies like "Titus."

    There are a lot of horrid, bad movies out there and there are a lot of unwatchable, boring movies out there. With this movie, we get the worst of both worlds. 1) The characters. The actual warriors have no real character; the movie has to list their personality traits! The kid himself is not interesting and the villain is just over-the-top goofy. 2) The visuals. The world of Tao (Actually pronounced "Dao") is nothing you haven't seen before and the puppetry is pitifully bad. Mouth movements by the warriors and others rarely match up with dialog. Fight scenes are simply unwatchable, with this weird frame-cutting technique. 3) The slug-like pace. If it wasn't for Mountain Dew, I would've fallen asleep numerous times. At least with films like Battlefield Earth, we get entertainment, even at the expense of the movie. Here, we don't have such luck.

    I stumbled upon this one basically by accident. While channel surfing at midnight, this came on, and saw an ordinary world kid in some pretty ancient looking forest, exploring it with a "where am I?" face, so I pretty much could tell this was some outsider boy who lives adventures in a fantasy world. If you haven't noticed from the mere cover of the movie, this is no Lord of the Rings. Even worse, it doesn't live up to cult classic fantasies like Krull, Willow or Dark Crystal. I'm a big fan of fantasy movies that deal with what I like to call "the outsider myth": some kid magically travels to a distant land and lives adventures (who wouldn't like to?), so I was left hypnotized with the potentially entertaining story and, (forgive me) the Elysia character. However, one of many flaws with this movie are the Warriors of Virtue themselves. They're kinda rat or kangaroo-looking people with great martial arts knowledge. Rather out of place for this type of fantasy, and when you see them in action, it just doesn't work. It's like watching sports mascots practicing kung fu. Much more laughable than exciting. This can be a turn off if you expected classic sword and sorcery swashbuckling, for instead, it delivers martial arts in flurry costumes. The sets are awful, with no variety. No exploration of this fantastic (sarcasm) land is ever done, and all you see is a forest, an evil palace lair, the same forest and huts on trees in (you guessed it) the forest. The main villain, one girly, over-the-top emperor, is both campy and not so evil. There appears to be a major battle to occur between his soldiers and the good guys, but no real sword fight ever occurs. Instead, you see more fluffy karate. The Evil Emperor inexplicably splits into five guys and fights all five warriors. If you thought that would be boring, they even show it in blurry vision, just another sign of the movie's inappropriately low budget. And by the end, the bad guy somehow has amnesia, forgets he was so cruel and joins the good guys (to make things even more yawn inducing). Like you could actually care. An underrated score by Don Davis helps the movie from falling completely into oblivion, but not an entirely new sound. The mythology might sound good, so maybe a remake some decades later could squeeze some more juice to the premise. But, until that happens, you can keep "Warriors of Virtue" on the shelf and pass it on.

    My kids were acting like little monsters, so I was going to just have them sit down and watch Spykids, but are DVD player wasn't working, so I turned on the VCR and made them watch a video from my best friends VHS collection. I never saw the movie before and neither did my kids it took about 20 mins before the kids realized how bad this movie truly was! I said, "fine don't watch", but then they were acting up again. So, I sat them on the couch and told them they are going to watch the whole movie, til dinner was ready. Lets just say from now on, when I really want to punish them, I put them in the basement and make them watch the movie as punishment. My kids have never been so well behaved.

    Alright, I admit going in that I was predisposed to dislike this movie. I have studied Taoism for many years, and I guess I don't take kindly to it being reduced down to a 90 minute family friendly event. Although it came highly recommended to me, I was put off by it's kid friendly approach to something as complex as Eastern Philosophy. Through out the film, I could not shake the vision I had of a Roos vs Turtles sequel. Although not as bad as I feared, this film looks for all the world like it was edited by a Cuisinart. The over extended climatic fight scene had so many different editing styles present that it nearly gave me an epileptic fit. Either that, or my digital TV is on the blink. I really cannot recommend this film to anybody except possible a few hard core gamers who would get off on the cartoon-like action sequences.

    This film is one of those forgotten 90s rip-offs from the Ninja Turtle fall out. It's easy to forget how insane the turtle craze was but it is also easy to forget that the original TMNT movie was actually pretty decent. Most of it's sequels and copies were not. Which brings us to this little gem... It's a film so bad it's good. The fight scenes are sloe-mo with wind-blown leaves for no reason other than effect. The warriors of virtue are kangaroos with martial art skills, they personify the virtues eg patience....and it's fight to the death between good and evil. All told it's a great movie for kids that the adults can enjoy while pretending to be too old for it.

    I absolutely adore this movie! It's a wonderful family film, it has a great storyline, and the fight sequences aren't all that bad. The only bad thing is when they slow the camera down slightly for effect (and that's not even terrible in itself). The characters are lovable, there are several quite funny parts, and it leaves you with a warm feeling in your heart. Warriors of Virtue is a masterpiece. PS - in case anyone didn't know, the poster at the top of the page is not the poster for this Warriors of Virtue movie. That's the poster for the other version, from either Japan or China (can't remember). The actual poster has Mario Yedidia on it. You can find it on Google :)

    Hokey over-sized Zen kangaroos using Buddhist philosophy and preposterous martial arts in cumbersome Halloween costumes (Who spray-painted the Barney outfit?) to defeat some demented creep in eye-liner while yakking interminably about virtue and Taoist theology. Short on warriors, shorter on virtue, the potty-mouth dialogue is anything but virtuous, especially in the scripted lines written for 12-year-olds. (Make that "by 12-year-olds".) This turkey ranks with "The Neverending Story"...minus the "story". I'll bet the studios are still looking for the guy that took them on this one. On your deathbed, you'll wish you had this 103 minutes back. If you haven't yet wasted your time on this bomb, repent of the notion while there's hope. Ralph Macchio should be thankful he was too old to be caught in the kid's role. Who writes this stuff???
