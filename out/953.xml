    I had the displeasure of watching this movie during my first semester of college in my film class. When I heard that it had Michael Richards and john Turturro I was pretty excited, but that all changed once my professor hit "play". The acting was not bad but the story was flat-out terrible. Without giving spoilers away, let me just say that I don't care if they had recruited the best actors in Hollywood to be in this film because the plot is beyond boring and is the most uninteresting thing I have seen to date. Poor writing and poor directing turned this movie into a dumpster fire.

    (Spoilers) Steven is a twelve year old with a father, Sid, who fancies himself as an inventor. Most of Sid's inventions are rather ridiculous, like a retractable canopy for a bed, with an "escape hatch" that is just an opening. I assume that Sid's inventions were exaggerated in order to create an image of him as a weird scientist, but his inventions were too trumped up just for effect for me to believe. Steven's mother is dying of cancer and, between his father's craziness and his mother's illness, Steven decides to run away to live with two of his uncles. Sid is normal compared to the uncles. Uncle Arthur rummages through trash to collect any item he finds interesting. He collects bouncing balls. In one scene Steven opens a closet door only to be engulfed by a couple hundred balls stored there. Think about that, how could that storage be accomplished? Except on a movie set. Steven's uncle Danny is paranoid and is always running from some imaginary pursuer, doing stupid things like entering a house through a window in order to avoid being detected. As Danny, Michael Richards' frenetic antics so irritated me that I almost bailed. Maury Chaykin, as Arthur, evinces some warmth, and, as Steven, Nathan Watt gives the most natural performance of all the actors. These two performances were about the only positives for me. Forced zaniness played against a backdrop of terminal cancer is a tricky thing to pull off and this story failed in its attempt. These people were never real enough for me to be engaged.

    A young boy with an inventor for a father and a sick but loving mother finds life's answers in the unusual shenanigans of his two odd uncles, played by Michael Richards and Maury Chaykin. The uncles are hoarders and one is extremely paranoid. Though it's not really a coming-of-age story, the boy does expand his horizons through the unusual insights of his two uncles, one of whom collects, among everything else, balls "because they carry the sound of children playing" within them. It's a fairly interesting movie but nothing groundbreaking. Director Diane Keaton does about as well as anyone can with the material at hand. The two odd uncles provide a unique look at life to a confused young boy's eyes. John Turturro as the father is pretty unusual when we meet him as well but he loses his quirkiness once his wife, Andie MacDowell, comes down with an illness from which there is no hope of escape. The boy, now given a sense of self and purpose from his uncles, now has to rescue his father from giving up on life. The movie sways from comedy to pathos but is worth a viewing.

    It is ironic how someone gives us poetry and we try to make a user/living manual out of it. Not good for us, not good for the work of art. There is a poignant quote at the beginning of the film where Steven/Franz was narrating that 'Heroes are those who find their own ways. This will be the year you find yours.' (not verbatim). Here is to each of us finding our own ways, while enjoying art works like Unstrung Heroes for what they are, poetry. P.S. Poetry is not always a writings that have stanzas that end with similar sounding words. Poetry is life itself. Cheers!

    This work will walk you down the dark aisles of insanity, waltz you through some of life's unexpected moments, and will help you remember it long after it's gone. Andie MacDowell, John Turturo, Michael Richards. A boy whose mother is dying must move in with crazy uncles. While there, you learn just how resilient children are; how witty, intelligent, and full of tolerance they are, when not fed the prejudices of their parents. The drama here is quite tense, interspersed with comedic moments, which will break your heart while making you laugh. This is above all, a drama, but the comedy is beautifully touching and serves to adequately distract you from the fact that your heart is breaking. This is probably the most enjoyable drama I have ever been forced to view. It rates an 8.8/10 from... the Fiend :.

    Since this story goes back and forth between a comedy and a really sad, dramatic story, I guess you could call it unique. The drama is much more at the end involving Andie McDowell's character. Supposedly, this is a true-life story of Steven "Franz" Lidz and his wacky family - the kid (Nathan Watt), the father (John Turturro) and the two uncles (Maury Chaykin and Michael Richards.). The story has a lot of Jewish flavor and religious themes, pro and con. It's not an easy story to explain so I won't go past what I've said that it's simply an interesting portrait of a different-kind of family with lots of laughs early on but tears later. You could get an idea early on that it's kind of a sweet movie, but there are some uncomfortable scenes in here. There is a little bit of about everything, guaranteed to strike everyone's emotions somewhere along the way. The story stayed with me long after I first watched it.

    Directed by Diane Keaton and adapted from a book by Franz Lidz. A young mother Selma Lidz(Andie MacDowell)is battling a very serious illness and her self proclaimed inventor husband Sid(John Tururro)is a little lacking in the emotions department. Unhappy with the new home situation, their sensitive son Steven(Nathan Watt)decides he wants to stay with his two eccentric uncles Danny(Michael Richards)and Melvin(Lou Cutell)until his mom is well. Steven seems to be happier and even takes interest in his strange uncle's living habits; he even decides he wants to change his name to Franz. Set in the early 60's, this drama is a bit comedic...change that to zany. Not being a MacDowell fan, UNSTRUNG HEROES assures my attitude; albeit I enjoyed the film and it is not a total waste.

    Right, I know this movie. Nathan Watt is smart indeed, the story, however, did not live up to my expectations. I mean, yeah, the underlying themes are lovely and easily detectable. The end was quite good, when Nathan and his dad were watching the movie sequence together in which the boy's late mom appears. That's a heart-rending sequence. The rest of the plot was somehow a bit too weird too me. I mean the uncles - what shall I make of them? They are two thorough oddballs, and I just don't like such characters who are nuts. Nathan though - he was the one who actually made me watch the entire movie. The father-son aspect was fine and emotionally agreeable, as well as the boy's uncertainty whether or not to change his confession. He did very well, indeed. The movie itself is honest and dealing with tough themes. I'll give a 7 actually.

    "Unstrung Heroes" is incontrovertible evidence that Diane Keaton is a great director. It focuses on Steven Lidz, a Jewish boy in the early 1960's whose happy life is upset when his mother Selma (Andie MacDowell) is diagnosed with cancer. Unable to bear it, he moves in with his blacklisted uncles, Danny (Michael Richards) and Arthur (Maury Chaykin). They teach Steven about his Jewish heritage, and by the end of the movie, he has had his bar mitzvah and feels freer in his existence. Some of the plot points may seem a little hackneyed, but Diane Keaton knows how to tell the story so that it isn't a clich&eacute;. A very good look at how the general atmosphere and zeitgeist in a certain part of American history affected one family.

    I watched this purely based on reviews...having never heard of it and reading only positive reviews (a first I think for an IMDb forum!). Regardless, I was really, pleasantly surprised and have to say unless this type of film is just not your cup of tea, it was really too beautiful in so many ways I might have lost count early on, but would have never been able to let it go as the film continued. Do yourself a favor and don't miss this little gem of a movie if you happen by it in the rental section or late one night on the satellite or cable. I won't give spoilers here because there is enough of that already...but you'll probably be pleasantly surprised and glad you took all the positive reviewers words for it on this one. Bravo.

    This work will walk you down the dark aisles of insanity, waltz you through some of life's unexpected moments, and will help you remember it long after it's gone. Andie MacDowell, John Turturo, Michael Richards. A boy whose mother is dying must move in with crazy uncles. While there, you learn just how resilient children are; how witty, intelligent, and full of tolerance they are, when not fed the prejudices of their parents. The drama here is quite tense, interspersed with comedic moments, which will break your heart while making you laugh. This is above all, a drama, but the comedy is beautifully touching and serves to adequately distract you from the fact that your heart is breaking. This is probably the most enjoyable drama I have ever been forced to view. It rates an 8.8/10 from... the Fiend :.

    Since this story goes back and forth between a comedy and a really sad, dramatic story, I guess you could call it unique. The drama is much more at the end involving Andie McDowell's character. Supposedly, this is a true-life story of Steven "Franz" Lidz and his wacky family - the kid (Nathan Watt), the father (John Turturro) and the two uncles (Maury Chaykin and Michael Richards.). The story has a lot of Jewish flavor and religious themes, pro and con. It's not an easy story to explain so I won't go past what I've said that it's simply an interesting portrait of a different-kind of family with lots of laughs early on but tears later. You could get an idea early on that it's kind of a sweet movie, but there are some uncomfortable scenes in here. There is a little bit of about everything, guaranteed to strike everyone's emotions somewhere along the way. The story stayed with me long after I first watched it.

    Directed by Diane Keaton and adapted from a book by Franz Lidz. A young mother Selma Lidz(Andie MacDowell)is battling a very serious illness and her self proclaimed inventor husband Sid(John Tururro)is a little lacking in the emotions department. Unhappy with the new home situation, their sensitive son Steven(Nathan Watt)decides he wants to stay with his two eccentric uncles Danny(Michael Richards)and Melvin(Lou Cutell)until his mom is well. Steven seems to be happier and even takes interest in his strange uncle's living habits; he even decides he wants to change his name to Franz. Set in the early 60's, this drama is a bit comedic...change that to zany. Not being a MacDowell fan, UNSTRUNG HEROES assures my attitude; albeit I enjoyed the film and it is not a total waste.

    Right, I know this movie. Nathan Watt is smart indeed, the story, however, did not live up to my expectations. I mean, yeah, the underlying themes are lovely and easily detectable. The end was quite good, when Nathan and his dad were watching the movie sequence together in which the boy's late mom appears. That's a heart-rending sequence. The rest of the plot was somehow a bit too weird too me. I mean the uncles - what shall I make of them? They are two thorough oddballs, and I just don't like such characters who are nuts. Nathan though - he was the one who actually made me watch the entire movie. The father-son aspect was fine and emotionally agreeable, as well as the boy's uncertainty whether or not to change his confession. He did very well, indeed. The movie itself is honest and dealing with tough themes. I'll give a 7 actually.

    "Unstrung Heroes" is incontrovertible evidence that Diane Keaton is a great director. It focuses on Steven Lidz, a Jewish boy in the early 1960's whose happy life is upset when his mother Selma (Andie MacDowell) is diagnosed with cancer. Unable to bear it, he moves in with his blacklisted uncles, Danny (Michael Richards) and Arthur (Maury Chaykin). They teach Steven about his Jewish heritage, and by the end of the movie, he has had his bar mitzvah and feels freer in his existence. Some of the plot points may seem a little hackneyed, but Diane Keaton knows how to tell the story so that it isn't a clich&eacute;. A very good look at how the general atmosphere and zeitgeist in a certain part of American history affected one family.

    I watched this purely based on reviews...having never heard of it and reading only positive reviews (a first I think for an IMDb forum!). Regardless, I was really, pleasantly surprised and have to say unless this type of film is just not your cup of tea, it was really too beautiful in so many ways I might have lost count early on, but would have never been able to let it go as the film continued. Do yourself a favor and don't miss this little gem of a movie if you happen by it in the rental section or late one night on the satellite or cable. I won't give spoilers here because there is enough of that already...but you'll probably be pleasantly surprised and glad you took all the positive reviewers words for it on this one. Bravo.
