    I dug up this DVD in a sale for 1 euro, so for that money I dared to take a little risk, not having ever heard anything about this movie. I was attracted by the text on the cover: something about dancing, music and Broadway, which sounded promising. To my surprise this actually turned out to be a very good and solid movie, very well directed and equally well acted, and with an interesting and meaningful story. It's about this thirty-something Broadway dancer that can't accept the fact that he's growing too old for the lime lights and that it's time to make some important choices in his life. He's constantly in denial and trying to prove his everlasting youth, by screwing around, rejecting the ties of marriage that his faithful girlfriend hopes for, auditioning for parts that are too difficult and youthful for his age. We witness his gradual downhill slide, loosing jobs, mostly because of his own arrogance, failing at auditions, getting kicked out off his girlfriends house and at last stooping as low as to play the gigolo, but failing even at that! The remarkable thing is, that all this could make for a movie that's top-heavy with drama, but it actually succeeds in avoiding that pitfall. It's as if we watch a real life documentary, everything is shown in its proper realistic, almost uneventful way, no weird turns and twists, no melodrama, no climaxes. The story simply unfolds before our eyes and is fascinating in it's own right. The main character Nick is throughout the movie absolutely unsympathetic to say the least, yet we can see what is eating him up and that still makes you care for him, which proves a very skillful and subtle direction. Actor Rick Negr&oacute;n keeps his acting "small", and is totally convincing as the not-so-young-anymore stud, handsome, vain and arrogant but terrified of his vague future. Negr&oacute;n is obviously a skilled and professional dancer, and throughout the movie we see some fine dancing numbers that give the movie authenticity and pace. The other acting is overall very good, especially mentioning Kristin Moreu as the cheated girlfriend. There's some rather steamy sex now and then, but these scenes fit in well enough with the story and the characters. My only (modest) criticism is, that after the total downfall of Nick, his change in the last 5 minutes comes a little bit too sudden, I would have liked to see something of the catharsis that we are supposed to suspect behind this at-last-seeing-the-light. But the visualization of this step towards Nick's mental capsize is very inventive and original, when we see him standing in utter desperation on the edge of a skyscrapers rooftop and then.... All in all this is a very good movie, well made, well acted, with some very good dancing and a message that's worthwhile. So to me it's a mystery why this movie is not more well-known, why this director Christian Faber since then only directed one other movie, and why actor Rick Negr&oacute;n, according to the IMDb-site, since then only seems to have done some odd acting-jobs, mainly as an extra. He really deserves (and is clearly capable of) more than that!

    I think this was a very good movie, well acted, written, directed. You could actually see and enjoy a lot of the choreography unlike so many dance movies. I, however, must question the release date of 1997. It says to me it is a 1980s movie, early 90s at most. Why? Look who is in it? Thomas Gibson in a tiny part as a bartender? Taylor Nichols in a minor supporting role? And the choreography looked of that time, Donald Byrd looked at least ten years younger than he does now, etc. I saw dancers I knew in classes in the 80s, they couldn't look exactly the same now. So I say, this was originally filmed around 1989, before Far and Away and Metropolitan, and was released to DVD in 1997. Can anyone confirm or deny this?

    Nick (Rich Negron) has been a noteworthy dancer in Broadway's chorus lines for quite a number of years. He also has a sweet, beautiful live-in girlfriend named Amy (Kristin Moreu). Amy, a former dancer whose career was cut short by injury, now works in physical therapy. It is her fervent wish to marry Nick. Nick, however, has a roving eye and has been participating in an extracurricular romance with Heidi, also a dancer. When Nick's current Broadway show folds suddenly, he has two hard choices staring him in the face. Is he too old to compete in the world of dance and should he marry Amy? This is an excellent examination of career paths that last only a brief number of years. Negron's portrayal of a man obsessed with proving his stamina and vitality rings true. Nick indulges in spontaneous sexual encounters and refuses other job offers when he should analyze what is really important to him. All of the lovely actresses in the film are captivating, with Moreu giving a caring, vulnerable performance. The dance sequences are lively and fun. What a shame that this film does not have a higher profile. Despite some brief scenes of strong sexuality, it deserves the attention of those who admire films dealing with the lost specter of youth.
