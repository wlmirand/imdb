    Hercules was made in 1997 and Disney kinda lost its marbles a bit with this one and I'm gonna start off with the negative side first just to get it out of the way.......THE SONGS. I swear I do like I Can Go The Distance and I Won't Say I'm In Love,but the rest of the songs were just dreadful and the man who's responsible for this is ALAN MENKEN the same man that brought us Pocahontas,Beauty & The Beast,Enchanted and Tangled(which had a better score BTW). Its kinda confusing because the ending credits song was sung by Micheal Bolton(yeah that husky male singer who sings When A Man Loves A Woman)I mean what is the score suppose to represent Gospel Church Music or Pop music,cause I'm confused. Well alright enough about me bashing the songs what's the movie about well the movie is about a Greek God named Hercules(voiced first by Josh Keaton and later by Tate Donovan)who was sent to Earth by Hades and his sidekicks who are body shifters(they can literally turn themselves into humans or animals)cause Hades wants to rule the kingdom and his got a grudge against Hercules dad(voiced by Rip Thorn). Of course when Hercules grows up and becomes a hero(like Superman or Rocky)he meets a sly sarcastic woman named Meg(voiced by Broadway Singer and Actress Susan Egan)who's also very flirty,but is she for real or is she hiding something from Hercules. Bottom line I did enjoy Hercules for its animation and the charcthers were great(if I had to be honest I found Meg to be my favourite cause she was mysterious and sarcastic yet nice at the same time).One scene did have me laughing and it was when Meg said this I'm a damsel i'm in distress,I can handle this,have a nice day, that was funny. Overall is Hercules the best Disney movie ever NO its not its pretty above average,but do I like it yeah sure its a good flick,despite the fact the songs to its credit are good but some of them are just all over the place. So its a 6 from me.

    Listen. If this had ANYTHING to do with Hercules, I would be fine with it. This is just some strong guy with an evil blue guy after him. FIRST OF ALL: In REAL Greek Mythology, Hades wasn't evil. At all. In fact, he was actually considered to be the honest and protective god of Ancient Greece. This made him into their version of the devil, which he doesn't represent at all. Second: Hera is the villain. Sorry if you missed preschool, elementary school, middle school (if you have that where you live), and High School. And college. And never talked to anyone. But Hera was actually who was after Heracles (the actual spelling of Hercules, they messed that up too.), because he was born with a woman Zeus cheated on her with. In this, she is a loving mother who is afraid for her son. And third: Heracles is not a love story. At all. In fact, he's married already in mythology, but kills her. Yeah, sorry made up lady from the movie, but you never existed anywhere else, and your closest counterpart was killed viciously. Hades never dies, Heracles doesn't have a Pegasus, and Heracles eventually marries a goddess of youth, Hebe, and I think that in the movie it *SPOILERS NOW* ended with him staying on Earth with his girlfriend, but I'm just remembering that. *SPOILERS END* This is the only movie from Disney's prime time that I cannot stand.

    Ever since 1989 when they released The Little Mermaid, the Walt Disney Company had been on a roll with producing high quality animated features again. From such landmark animated features such as Beauty and the Beast to heavily underrated animated films like The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Disney had practically returned to top form. And while Disney's 1997 full-length animated feature Hercules may not bare comparison to the best Disney animated films that came out during that time, it's still an entertaining enough picture in its own unique way. The film starts with the Greek god Zeus (Rip Torn) and his wife Hera celebrating the birth of their son Hercules with the other gods of Olympus, including his evil brother Hades (James Woods). Hades wants to take over Mount Olympus and believes that Hercules will stand in his way. So, he sends his minions Pain and Panic to kidnap baby Hercules and make him drink a potion that will turn him mortal. However, young Hercules still obtains his unusual strength from Mount Olympus and becomes adopted by farmers. As he grows up, he has trouble fitting in with other people due to his strength and wants to finally find out where he came from in the first place. He is able to learn about his real past from Zeus' statue in the Temple of Zeus and also learns that he can reclaim his place on Mount Olympus if he can become a "true hero". Hercules is then sent to find a satyr by the name of Phil (Danny DeVito) who has been known to train some of the finest heroes Greece has ever seen, but has retired due to one letdown too many. But Hercules convinces him otherwise and Phil trains Hercules into a possible hero. When Hercules is older and ready, he and Phil decide to head for the dangerous city of Thebes so that Hercules can perform "heroic deeds" to get the attention of the Gods. On the way, Hercules meets a damsel-in-distress named Meg whom Hercules eventually starts to fall in love with even though he doesn't know that she's secretly Hades' minion. As Hercules starts to become a celebrity of sorts for all the "heroic deeds" he does for the citizens of Thebes, he eventually begins to realize what it really means to be a true hero. I personally thought it was kind of funny how the reason why Hercules was a misfit when he was a teenager was because he was too physically strong. I liked that scene when teenage Hercules accidentally destroys an entire temple (where Greek citizens hang out and apparently "shop" at as well) all for the innocent sake of catching a Frisbee. That scene in a way shows a potential downside to being unusually strong on a physical level. For the record, I'm not saying that exercising isn't important, I'm saying that excessive exercising might not be important. Another aspect about the story of Hercules that I liked was the message it was getting across. That message being that a true hero is someone who doesn't simply defeat many of their evil opponents, but is someone who does something brave that no normal person in their right mind would have the courage to do. In other words, a true hero is a person who does the right thing that no one else will ever do. While Hercules did stand up to enormous creatures that no one else would stand up to, it was, at first, technically more for showing off his strength rather than doing something beneficial for humanity. By far, the most interesting character in this entire picture is the villain Hades. Yes, I realize how clich&eacute;d picking the villain as the best character of a movie can be, but I can't help it. The villains are usually more fascinating characters than most heroes, and the villain in Hercules is no exception. I thought that the animation design of Hades in particular was really cool and the way the color of his flame/hair reflected his emotions (red symbolizing his anger, blue symbolizing that he's calm). But of course, James Woods' voice-over delivery is really what makes this character complete. I admire how Hades doesn't talk like your normal Disney villain would talk, but instead talks similar to a businessman. I don't think the story to Hercules is really that original save for a few little touches, and there are little to no surprises regarding where the plot will go. Just like most other Disney films, you can easily predict how everything will turn out in the end without any problems. I personally could have done without a few side characters particularly some of the sidekicks, like Pain and Panic, which were only created for the sole purpose of killing some screen time. Although I didn't mind the style of the animation or the music in this film, it may not be for everybody. I can understand where people are coming from when they say that they didn't care for the music. I will admit that black gospel music mixed with Greek mythology is an unusual mix to say the least. Personally, I found at least two songs that I liked and at least one song that I didn't care for. Some people say that the animation style is weird, but honestly, I wasn't too bothered by it either since I thought the style was unique. Overall, as far as Disney animated features go, Hercules is okay. It's light and fluffy, but it won't leave much of an impact as something like Beauty and the Beast did. If all that you need is simply an entertaining enough film to show to your kids, then Hercules should do the trick no problem.

    A Disney musical revolving around Greek mythology seems like a great idea. And in Disney's Hercules, the house of mouse makes great use of the famous characters and setting of Greek mythology. There's some hip, gospel songs and plenty of successful humor. So much works in this movie, but it's all sadly counter-balanced by everything that doesn't work. Hercules is born to the god and goddess, Zeus and Hera respectively. And while there is joy at his arrival, Hades wishes to do away with the baby, as his fortune reveals Hercules as a potential threat. Hades sends his two dim-witted minions, Pain and Panic to turn Hercules mortal, and then kill him. Unfortunately for Hades, Pain and Panic slip up when Hercules transformation from god to mortal gets stopped part way through, causing Hercules to retain his supernatural strength, but remain mortal. Hercules longs to be reunited with his parents and the other gods, though he cannot until he becomes a hero, which will then allow him to be turned back into a god. The set up for this story is extremely rushed, and feels almost tacked on. It's like Disney didn't want to spend much time developing the opening, and were more interested in cutting to the action. As a result, there isn't much at the beginning that's of interest, with the exception of one excellent gospel-style song, but I'll get to that later. The characters are mostly uninteresting. Hercules and the romantic interest, Megara (known as Meg) are almost completely personality-less, while Philoctetes (known as Phil), Hercules' trainer, is just a big grump. Only the villain, Hades, is at all interesting, even if he's basically just a hipper version of Jafar or Scar. Focusing less on story, Hercules relies on humor to get by. And while most of the humor is successful and funny, there aren't many big laughs here. Disney's next attempt at a hip comedy (The Emperor's New Groove) is a much more successful and enjoyable film. There's some curious character oversights, and some muddled messages here and there. There are dull stretches, and the action at the end is a bit excessive. Flaws are not hard to find. The songs are of ranging success. The majority of the songs are jazzy gospel tunes, complete with a group of African-American women singing the lyrics. Not only are these songs an innovative and refreshing concept, but the songs are fun and energetic too. It's hard to suppress a smile during these delightful numbers. And yet, there are two songs that don't fit into the gospel theme. They are entitled "Go the Distance" and "Our Last Hope." Both are relatively terrible and instantly forgettable. "Go the Distance" exists only to explain Hercules' desire to go home. This is the kind of song that could've been written in 5 minutes over lunch. "Our Last Hope" has a terrible rhythm and bland lyrics and is ultimately, a mess. It surprises me that a song was not provided for the villain, Hades. Just about every Disney films has had a song for the villain, so why did Hades have to miss out? His slick and sly personality would've been perfect for a nice jazzy beat. The voice cast is a mixed bag. Tate Donovan provides a bland voice for Hercules, and Danny DeVito does the same for Phil. Susan Egan's voice for Meg is much more unique. It's a shame there wasn't an interesting character to go with it. James Wood is wonderful as Hades, providing a perfectly sly and confident voice for the villain. The animation is detailed enough, but the animation style is a bit of a problem. The flat, geometric look just makes the animation appear cheap and lazy. CGI is occasionally integrated into the animation, and it looks great. Alan Menken's score is superb, if a little shy of his work in other Disney films of the time. Grand melodies and exciting action music make this score a success, even though it sounds a bit familiar to Menken's score for Aladdin. Sometimes funny, but riddled with flaws, Hercules is a disappointing Disney feature. As much as I wanted to like Hercules, there's just so much that doesn't work here. I felt uninterested in the characters and the story, and for most of the film, I was just waiting for the next toe-tapping gospel tune. The 90's was a great time for Disney, but Hercules may not be the best example of such success.

    I absolutely adore this movie, and I believe it is one of the most underrated Disney movies, especially of the renaissance. It's full of the ingredients to make a perfect Disney movie: Comedy (thank you, James Woods/The Muses), a brilliant role model for young girls (Megara), and catchy songs, which you know already. It sucks that this movie doesn't get the recognition it deserves. Although I think that almost everything that comes out of the Disney studios is pure wonderful (with the exception of Cars....yikes), this is definitely a stand out in what they did. I'd even go as far as to say that this movie trumps one of Disney's classics of the 90's - Aladdin. Maybe it just wasn't marketed properly, but I believe this should be up there with the greats. In short, I love this movie, as I've mentioned 500 times already. My 3rd favourite in my list of Disney movies, and very hard to shove from that position. And who put the glad in gladiator?

    I am a person who really enjoys Disney films, despite my age. (I'm 20.) Some people say that Hercules was the film that killed people's interest in animated Disney films after Pocahontas and The Hunchback of Notre Dame came out. I personally believe that it was a decent film. However, I think it could've turned out to be one of their best movies. It had the story to do it, and it also had a very funny, plus popular villain in Hades. It just turned out to be very problematic. First off, I think the way the story is told is very odd. You have 5 women, who are known as "The Muses". They basically tell the beginning of the film in song, introduce us to Hades, and you see them appear during the movie. You see them have a song when Hercules is becoming popular, when Hercules' love interest, Meg, is trying to decide whether she's in love or not, and at the end of the film after Hercules stopped Hades. They act very surprised each time they appear. "Oh my god, Hercules is becoming popular! Oh wow, he stopped Hades!" I think if the Muses weren't telling the story, and it was told without continuing narration, this film would be considered a classic. I also have a problem with the transitions. At one point, the film is trying to be a comedy, and the other, it's dramatic. You can put them into a film, but you need it to transition well. It does not in this film. I think they were trying to be like Aladdin, but the transitions between comedy and drama worked in that film. It does not here. This film is also like ancient Greece meets modern day Las Vegas. I mainly say that in the "Zero to Hero" song. You see all those flashing lights and lighting changes, and you see some modern-like products placed like "Herculade" and "Air-Herc". If I'm watching something that took place a very long time ago, I don't wanna see something similar to Gatorade. Sure, Aladdin had that too in the "Friend Like Me" song, but it makes sense because he has a magic genie. Here, it doesn't. But the reason I think it's decent is because, like I said, it does have a great story to tell. It's just told very weirdly. I also like the comedy in it. The scene where Pain and Panic are getting a lot of Hercules merchandise is really funny. Overall, this could've been a movie good enough to be considered one of Disney's best. It just had too many problems.

    So i picked this one up for 50% off at one of the local big box stores. My 4 year old daughter is in a real Disney phase right now, just devouring everything. We were at the point where we were picking up the more obscure Disney flicks from the 90's, like HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME and TARZAN (which we have found for dirt cheap!) I remembered seeing this back when it first came out in 97, and remember feeling like it was more of a boy movie, but for the price i figured "eh, if she even watches it once we got our money's worth out of it." My daughter had worn the DVDs for "SLEEPING BEAUTY" and "BEAUTY AND THE BEAST" right out, but neither of them compare to how much she loves "HERCULES"! Ever since i bought the movie a week ago she has watched the movie 2 times a day, each day, since then. It has trumped her love of every other Disney movie! I know a lot of people feel like Meg is a side character who doesn't really connect with most young girls, but my daughter looks at her as the absolute best Disney Princess of them all. I also have to say that "I won't say I'm in Love" has gotta be near the top of the list of the most under-appreciated, underrated Disney songs. My daughter keeps asking for me to replay that song over and over and over, and she dances up a storm to it. If you're thinking this movie might not appeal to the young Disney Princess in your life, think again. Really a gem for what you pay for it, right now!

    This movie is funny and really good but it isn't true Greek Mythology! Firstly the main character's name is HERACLES not HERCULES! Secondly he was a DEMIGOD not a GOD! And HERA wanted tho kill him instead of HADES! And the woman that Heracles liked was called DEIANIRA not MEGANA or MEG! And CHIRON trained him not PHIL! So you get the point. If you want to know about Greek mythology read a series of books called PERCY JACKSON or HEROES OF OLYMPUS. All in all this movie is funny and cute. It does have some real Greek Mythology in it though, but very little. The story teaches you that the strength of your heart is more important than strength itself. Thank you for reading.

    As a guy born in 1993, I grew up when Disney was putting out some classics. I.E. The Lion King, Aladdin, Toy Story, the list goes on and on. But I have to say, when you talk to people about Disney in the '90s, Hercules doesn't usually come up in conversation. I have no idea why. For those who denounce it for it's lack of mythical accuracy, what a bunch of garbage. Do you think Aladdin was historically accurate? Can lions talk? No, so what's the big deal with tweaking Greek Mythology in order to make a children's movie? There shouldn't be one. This movie is such a complete, feel good flick that it motivated me to write a review on here. I'm on this site every day without fail, and I've never felt enthused or irritated enough to post a review. Well I watched this movie again for the first time in years and I just had to. Incredible soundtrack, inspiring story, and great dynamic between the characters. Personally this is my favorite performance of James Woods. In fact, I'm not even a fan of James Woods but he is awesome in this, Hades is almost lovable as the main villain. This movie was as much fun for me at age 19 as it was when I saw it in theaters at age 4, probably even more enjoyable. Watch it despite what you've heard. Show your kids, I know I'm planning on it

    I just had to sign in to write up a review. Overall (Not Average): 8.5/10 Originality/Creativity: 9/10 It's a pretty neat and original story as compared to others of the time (1997). It gave a total twist to the female roles in typical Disney movies. The humour of Meg and Hades was really different too. Music: 8/10 I really love the Muses and the insert singing of Hercules and Meg. The lyrics also really suit the movie instead of taking insert songs, where the lyrics doesn't really "fit in". Of course there are also really good music/songs by other Disney movies too. They got really awesome music most the time, like Little Mermaid. Educational Purposes/Authenticity to Source: 2/10 I basically threw a random low score that makes me "feel" right. Hera isn't Hercules' mother. The "step-mother" was the real mother, at least according to Wikipedia. Hercules isn't a God, just a demi-god, which he stayed true to (in the end, sort of). Hercules had all those adventures, or "trials", which is "sort of" what Hercules in this movie did to become the "true hero". Basically, some facts are somewhat right but not for the right reasons. So it's pretty bad. Cautious Note for "Reviewers": It's really bad to put false information in a kid's movie. It's giving kids false info. But at the same time, it's a kid's movie. It's suppose to be childish, silly, not real and fantasy-like. This should be an element put aside. And to top it off, reviewing a kid's movie should be done by kid's who watched it at the age of 4-10 or whatever.

He is able to learn about his real past from Zeus' statue in the Temple of Zeus and also learns that he can reclaim his place on Mount Olympus if he can become a "true hero". Hercules is then sent to find a satyr by the name of Phil (Danny DeVito) who has been known to train some of the finest heroes Greece has ever seen, but has retired due to one letdown too many. But Hercules convinces him otherwise and Phil trains Hercules into a possible hero. When Hercules is older and ready, he and Phil decide to head for the dangerous city of Thebes so that Hercules can perform "heroic deeds" to get the attention of the Gods. On the way, Hercules meets a damsel-in-distress named Meg whom Hercules eventually starts to fall in love with even though he doesn't know that she's secretly Hades' minion. As Hercules starts to become a celebrity of sorts for all the "heroic deeds" he does for the citizens of Thebes, he eventually begins to realize what it really means to be a true hero. I personally thought it was kind of funny how the reason why Hercules was a misfit when he was a teenager was because he was too physically strong. I liked that scene when teenage Hercules accidentally destroys an entire temple (where Greek citizens hang out and apparently "shop" at as well) all for the innocent sake of catching a Frisbee. That scene in a way shows a potential downside to being unusually strong on a physical level. For the record, I'm not saying that exercising isn't important, I'm saying that excessive exercising might not be important. Another aspect about the story of Hercules that I liked was the message it was getting across. That message being that a true hero is someone who doesn't simply defeat many of their evil opponents, but is someone who does something brave that no normal person in their right mind would have the courage to do. In other words, a true hero is a person who does the right thing that no one else will ever do. While Hercules did stand up to enormous creatures that no one else would stand up to, it was, at first, technically more for showing off his strength rather than doing something beneficial for humanity. By far, the most interesting character in this entire picture is the villain Hades. Yes, I realize how clich&eacute;d picking the villain as the best character of a movie can be, but I can't help it. The villains are usually more fascinating characters than most heroes, and the villain in Hercules is no exception. I thought that the animation design of Hades in particular was really cool and the way the color of his flame/hair reflected his emotions (red symbolizing his anger, blue symbolizing that he's calm). But of course, James Woods' voice-over delivery is really what makes this character complete. I admire how Hades doesn't talk like your normal Disney villain would talk, but instead talks similar to a businessman. I don't think the story to Hercules is really that original save for a few little touches, and there are little to no surprises regarding where the plot will go. Just like most other Disney films, you can easily predict how everything will turn out in the end without any problems. I personally could have done without a few side characters particularly some of the sidekicks, like Pain and Panic, which were only created for the sole purpose of killing some screen time. Although I didn't mind the style of the animation or the music in this film, it may not be for everybody. I can understand where people are coming from when they say that they didn't care for the music. I will admit that black gospel music mixed with Greek mythology is an unusual mix to say the least. Personally, I found at least two songs that I liked and at least one song that I didn't care for. Some people say that the animation style is weird, but honestly, I wasn't too bothered by it either since I thought the style was unique. Overall, as far as Disney animated features go, Hercules is okay. It's light and fluffy, but it won't leave much of an impact as something like Beauty and the Beast did. If all that you need is simply an entertaining enough film to show to your kids, then Hercules should do the trick no problem.

    A Disney musical revolving around Greek mythology seems like a great idea. And in Disney's Hercules, the house of mouse makes great use of the famous characters and setting of Greek mythology. There's some hip, gospel songs and plenty of successful humor. So much works in this movie, but it's all sadly counter-balanced by everything that doesn't work. Hercules is born to the god and goddess, Zeus and Hera respectively. And while there is joy at his arrival, Hades wishes to do away with the baby, as his fortune reveals Hercules as a potential threat. Hades sends his two dim-witted minions, Pain and Panic to turn Hercules mortal, and then kill him. Unfortunately for Hades, Pain and Panic slip up when Hercules transformation from god to mortal gets stopped part way through, causing Hercules to retain his supernatural strength, but remain mortal. Hercules longs to be reunited with his parents and the other gods, though he cannot until he becomes a hero, which will then allow him to be turned back into a god. The set up for this story is extremely rushed, and feels almost tacked on. It's like Disney didn't want to spend much time developing the opening, and were more interested in cutting to the action. As a result, there isn't much at the beginning that's of interest, with the exception of one excellent gospel-style song, but I'll get to that later. The characters are mostly uninteresting. Hercules and the romantic interest, Megara (known as Meg) are almost completely personality-less, while Philoctetes (known as Phil), Hercules' trainer, is just a big grump. Only the villain, Hades, is at all interesting, even if he's basically just a hipper version of Jafar or Scar. Focusing less on story, Hercules relies on humor to get by. And while most of the humor is successful and funny, there aren't many big laughs here. Disney's next attempt at a hip comedy (The Emperor's New Groove) is a much more successful and enjoyable film. There's some curious character oversights, and some muddled messages here and there. There are dull stretches, and the action at the end is a bit excessive. Flaws are not hard to find. The songs are of ranging success. The majority of the songs are jazzy gospel tunes, complete with a group of African-American women singing the lyrics. Not only are these songs an innovative and refreshing concept, but the songs are fun and energetic too. It's hard to suppress a smile during these delightful numbers. And yet, there are two songs that don't fit into the gospel theme. They are entitled "Go the Distance" and "Our Last Hope." Both are relatively terrible and instantly forgettable. "Go the Distance" exists only to explain Hercules' desire to go home. This is the kind of song that could've been written in 5 minutes over lunch. "Our Last Hope" has a terrible rhythm and bland lyrics and is ultimately, a mess. It surprises me that a song was not provided for the villain, Hades. Just about every Disney films has had a song for the villain, so why did Hades have to miss out? His slick and sly personality would've been perfect for a nice jazzy beat. The voice cast is a mixed bag. Tate Donovan provides a bland voice for Hercules, and Danny DeVito does the same for Phil. Susan Egan's voice for Meg is much more unique. It's a shame there wasn't an interesting character to go with it. James Wood is wonderful as Hades, providing a perfectly sly and confident voice for the villain. The animation is detailed enough, but the animation style is a bit of a problem. The flat, geometric look just makes the animation appear cheap and lazy. CGI is occasionally integrated into the animation, and it looks great. Alan Menken's score is superb, if a little shy of his work in other Disney films of the time. Grand melodies and exciting action music make this score a success, even though it sounds a bit familiar to Menken's score for Aladdin. Sometimes funny, but riddled with flaws, Hercules is a disappointing Disney feature. As much as I wanted to like Hercules, there's just so much that doesn't work here. I felt uninterested in the characters and the story, and for most of the film, I was just waiting for the next toe-tapping gospel tune. The 90's was a great time for Disney, but Hercules may not be the best example of such success.

    I absolutely adore this movie, and I believe it is one of the most underrated Disney movies, especially of the renaissance. It's full of the ingredients to make a perfect Disney movie: Comedy (thank you, James Woods/The Muses), a brilliant role model for young girls (Megara), and catchy songs, which you know already. It sucks that this movie doesn't get the recognition it deserves. Although I think that almost everything that comes out of the Disney studios is pure wonderful (with the exception of Cars....yikes), this is definitely a stand out in what they did. I'd even go as far as to say that this movie trumps one of Disney's classics of the 90's - Aladdin. Maybe it just wasn't marketed properly, but I believe this should be up there with the greats. In short, I love this movie, as I've mentioned 500 times already. My 3rd favourite in my list of Disney movies, and very hard to shove from that position. And who put the glad in gladiator?

    I am a person who really enjoys Disney films, despite my age. (I'm 20.) Some people say that Hercules was the film that killed people's interest in animated Disney films after Pocahontas and The Hunchback of Notre Dame came out. I personally believe that it was a decent film. However, I think it could've turned out to be one of their best movies. It had the story to do it, and it also had a very funny, plus popular villain in Hades. It just turned out to be very problematic. First off, I think the way the story is told is very odd. You have 5 women, who are known as "The Muses". They basically tell the beginning of the film in song, introduce us to Hades, and you see them appear during the movie. You see them have a song when Hercules is becoming popular, when Hercules' love interest, Meg, is trying to decide whether she's in love or not, and at the end of the film after Hercules stopped Hades. They act very surprised each time they appear. "Oh my god, Hercules is becoming popular! Oh wow, he stopped Hades!" I think if the Muses weren't telling the story, and it was told without continuing narration, this film would be considered a classic. I also have a problem with the transitions. At one point, the film is trying to be a comedy, and the other, it's dramatic. You can put them into a film, but you need it to transition well. It does not in this film. I think they were trying to be like Aladdin, but the transitions between comedy and drama worked in that film. It does not here. This film is also like ancient Greece meets modern day Las Vegas. I mainly say that in the "Zero to Hero" song. You see all those flashing lights and lighting changes, and you see some modern-like products placed like "Herculade" and "Air-Herc". If I'm watching something that took place a very long time ago, I don't wanna see something similar to Gatorade. Sure, Aladdin had that too in the "Friend Like Me" song, but it makes sense because he has a magic genie. Here, it doesn't. But the reason I think it's decent is because, like I said, it does have a great story to tell. It's just told very weirdly. I also like the comedy in it. The scene where Pain and Panic are getting a lot of Hercules merchandise is really funny. Overall, this could've been a movie good enough to be considered one of Disney's best. It just had too many problems.

    So i picked this one up for 50% off at one of the local big box stores. My 4 year old daughter is in a real Disney phase right now, just devouring everything. We were at the point where we were picking up the more obscure Disney flicks from the 90's, like HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME and TARZAN (which we have found for dirt cheap!) I remembered seeing this back when it first came out in 97, and remember feeling like it was more of a boy movie, but for the price i figured "eh, if she even watches it once we got our money's worth out of it." My daughter had worn the DVDs for "SLEEPING BEAUTY" and "BEAUTY AND THE BEAST" right out, but neither of them compare to how much she loves "HERCULES"! Ever since i bought the movie a week ago she has watched the movie 2 times a day, each day, since then. It has trumped her love of every other Disney movie! I know a lot of people feel like Meg is a side character who doesn't really connect with most young girls, but my daughter looks at her as the absolute best Disney Princess of them all. I also have to say that "I won't say I'm in Love" has gotta be near the top of the list of the most under-appreciated, underrated Disney songs. My daughter keeps asking for me to replay that song over and over and over, and she dances up a storm to it. If you're thinking this movie might not appeal to the young Disney Princess in your life, think again. Really a gem for what you pay for it, right now!

    This movie is funny and really good but it isn't true Greek Mythology! Firstly the main character's name is HERACLES not HERCULES! Secondly he was a DEMIGOD not a GOD! And HERA wanted tho kill him instead of HADES! And the woman that Heracles liked was called DEIANIRA not MEGANA or MEG! And CHIRON trained him not PHIL! So you get the point. If you want to know about Greek mythology read a series of books called PERCY JACKSON or HEROES OF OLYMPUS. All in all this movie is funny and cute. It does have some real Greek Mythology in it though, but very little. The story teaches you that the strength of your heart is more important than strength itself. Thank you for reading.

    As a guy born in 1993, I grew up when Disney was putting out some classics. I.E. The Lion King, Aladdin, Toy Story, the list goes on and on. But I have to say, when you talk to people about Disney in the '90s, Hercules doesn't usually come up in conversation. I have no idea why. For those who denounce it for it's lack of mythical accuracy, what a bunch of garbage. Do you think Aladdin was historically accurate? Can lions talk? No, so what's the big deal with tweaking Greek Mythology in order to make a children's movie? There shouldn't be one. This movie is such a complete, feel good flick that it motivated me to write a review on here. I'm on this site every day without fail, and I've never felt enthused or irritated enough to post a review. Well I watched this movie again for the first time in years and I just had to. Incredible soundtrack, inspiring story, and great dynamic between the characters. Personally this is my favorite performance of James Woods. In fact, I'm not even a fan of James Woods but he is awesome in this, Hades is almost lovable as the main villain. This movie was as much fun for me at age 19 as it was when I saw it in theaters at age 4, probably even more enjoyable. Watch it despite what you've heard. Show your kids, I know I'm planning on it

    I just had to sign in to write up a review. Overall (Not Average): 8.5/10 Originality/Creativity: 9/10 It's a pretty neat and original story as compared to others of the time (1997). It gave a total twist to the female roles in typical Disney movies. The humour of Meg and Hades was really different too. Music: 8/10 I really love the Muses and the insert singing of Hercules and Meg. The lyrics also really suit the movie instead of taking insert songs, where the lyrics doesn't really "fit in". Of course there are also really good music/songs by other Disney movies too. They got really awesome music most the time, like Little Mermaid. Educational Purposes/Authenticity to Source: 2/10 I basically threw a random low score that makes me "feel" right. Hera isn't Hercules' mother. The "step-mother" was the real mother, at least according to Wikipedia. Hercules isn't a God, just a demi-god, which he stayed true to (in the end, sort of). Hercules had all those adventures, or "trials", which is "sort of" what Hercules in this movie did to become the "true hero". Basically, some facts are somewhat right but not for the right reasons. So it's pretty bad. Cautious Note for "Reviewers": It's really bad to put false information in a kid's movie. It's giving kids false info. But at the same time, it's a kid's movie. It's suppose to be childish, silly, not real and fantasy-like. This should be an element put aside. And to top it off, reviewing a kid's movie should be done by kid's who watched it at the age of 4-10 or whatever.

    Hercules was made in 1997 and Disney kinda lost its marbles a bit with this one and I'm gonna start off with the negative side first just to get it out of the way.......THE SONGS. I swear I do like I Can Go The Distance and I Won't Say I'm In Love,but the rest of the songs were just dreadful and the man who's responsible for this is ALAN MENKEN the same man that brought us Pocahontas,Beauty & The Beast,Enchanted and Tangled(which had a better score BTW). Its kinda confusing because the ending credits song was sung by Micheal Bolton(yeah that husky male singer who sings When A Man Loves A Woman)I mean what is the score suppose to represent Gospel Church Music or Pop music,cause I'm confused. Well alright enough about me bashing the songs what's the movie about well the movie is about a Greek God named Hercules(voiced first by Josh Keaton and later by Tate Donovan)who was sent to Earth by Hades and his sidekicks who are body shifters(they can literally turn themselves into humans or animals)cause Hades wants to rule the kingdom and his got a grudge against Hercules dad(voiced by Rip Thorn). Of course when Hercules grows up and becomes a hero(like Superman or Rocky)he meets a sly sarcastic woman named Meg(voiced by Broadway Singer and Actress Susan Egan)who's also very flirty,but is she for real or is she hiding something from Hercules. Bottom line I did enjoy Hercules for its animation and the charcthers were great(if I had to be honest I found Meg to be my favourite cause she was mysterious and sarcastic yet nice at the same time).One scene did have me laughing and it was when Meg said this I'm a damsel i'm in distress,I can handle this,have a nice day, that was funny. Overall is Hercules the best Disney movie ever NO its not its pretty above average,but do I like it yeah sure its a good flick,despite the fact the songs to its credit are good but some of them are just all over the place. So its a 6 from me.

    Listen. If this had ANYTHING to do with Hercules, I would be fine with it. This is just some strong guy with an evil blue guy after him. FIRST OF ALL: In REAL Greek Mythology, Hades wasn't evil. At all. In fact, he was actually considered to be the honest and protective god of Ancient Greece. This made him into their version of the devil, which he doesn't represent at all. Second: Hera is the villain. Sorry if you missed preschool, elementary school, middle school (if you have that where you live), and High School. And college. And never talked to anyone. But Hera was actually who was after Heracles (the actual spelling of Hercules, they messed that up too.), because he was born with a woman Zeus cheated on her with. In this, she is a loving mother who is afraid for her son. And third: Heracles is not a love story. At all. In fact, he's married already in mythology, but kills her. Yeah, sorry made up lady from the movie, but you never existed anywhere else, and your closest counterpart was killed viciously. Hades never dies, Heracles doesn't have a Pegasus, and Heracles eventually marries a goddess of youth, Hebe, and I think that in the movie it *SPOILERS NOW* ended with him staying on Earth with his girlfriend, but I'm just remembering that. *SPOILERS END* This is the only movie from Disney's prime time that I cannot stand.

    Ever since 1989 when they released The Little Mermaid, the Walt Disney Company had been on a roll with producing high quality animated features again. From such landmark animated features such as Beauty and the Beast to heavily underrated animated films like The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Disney had practically returned to top form. And while Disney's 1997 full-length animated feature Hercules may not bare comparison to the best Disney animated films that came out during that time, it's still an entertaining enough picture in its own unique way. The film starts with the Greek god Zeus (Rip Torn) and his wife Hera celebrating the birth of their son Hercules with the other gods of Olympus, including his evil brother Hades (James Woods). Hades wants to take over Mount Olympus and believes that Hercules will stand in his way. So, he sends his minions Pain and Panic to kidnap baby Hercules and make him drink a potion that will turn him mortal. However, young Hercules still obtains his unusual strength from Mount Olympus and becomes adopted by farmers. As he grows up, he has trouble fitting in with other people due to his strength and wants to finally find out where he came from in the first place. He is able to learn about his real past from Zeus' statue in the Temple of Zeus and also learns that he can reclaim his place on Mount Olympus if he can become a "true hero". Hercules is then sent to find a satyr by the name of Phil (Danny DeVito) who has been known to train some of the finest heroes Greece has ever seen, but has retired due to one letdown too many. But Hercules convinces him otherwise and Phil trains Hercules into a possible hero. When Hercules is older and ready, he and Phil decide to head for the dangerous city of Thebes so that Hercules can perform "heroic deeds" to get the attention of the Gods. On the way, Hercules meets a damsel-in-distress named Meg whom Hercules eventually starts to fall in love with even though he doesn't know that she's secretly Hades' minion. As Hercules starts to become a celebrity of sorts for all the "heroic deeds" he does for the citizens of Thebes, he eventually begins to realize what it really means to be a true hero. I personally thought it was kind of funny how the reason why Hercules was a misfit when he was a teenager was because he was too physically strong.

Sometimes funny, but riddled with flaws, Hercules is a disappointing Disney feature. As much as I wanted to like Hercules, there's just so much that doesn't work here. I felt uninterested in the characters and the story, and for most of the film, I was just waiting for the next toe-tapping gospel tune. The 90's was a great time for Disney, but Hercules may not be the best example of such success.

    I absolutely adore this movie, and I believe it is one of the most underrated Disney movies, especially of the renaissance. It's full of the ingredients to make a perfect Disney movie: Comedy (thank you, James Woods/The Muses), a brilliant role model for young girls (Megara), and catchy songs, which you know already. It sucks that this movie doesn't get the recognition it deserves. Although I think that almost everything that comes out of the Disney studios is pure wonderful (with the exception of Cars....yikes), this is definitely a stand out in what they did. I'd even go as far as to say that this movie trumps one of Disney's classics of the 90's - Aladdin. Maybe it just wasn't marketed properly, but I believe this should be up there with the greats. In short, I love this movie, as I've mentioned 500 times already. My 3rd favourite in my list of Disney movies, and very hard to shove from that position. And who put the glad in gladiator?

    I am a person who really enjoys Disney films, despite my age. (I'm 20.) Some people say that Hercules was the film that killed people's interest in animated Disney films after Pocahontas and The Hunchback of Notre Dame came out. I personally believe that it was a decent film. However, I think it could've turned out to be one of their best movies. It had the story to do it, and it also had a very funny, plus popular villain in Hades. It just turned out to be very problematic. First off, I think the way the story is told is very odd. You have 5 women, who are known as "The Muses". They basically tell the beginning of the film in song, introduce us to Hades, and you see them appear during the movie. You see them have a song when Hercules is becoming popular, when Hercules' love interest, Meg, is trying to decide whether she's in love or not, and at the end of the film after Hercules stopped Hades. They act very surprised each time they appear. "Oh my god, Hercules is becoming popular! Oh wow, he stopped Hades!" I think if the Muses weren't telling the story, and it was told without continuing narration, this film would be considered a classic. I also have a problem with the transitions. At one point, the film is trying to be a comedy, and the other, it's dramatic. You can put them into a film, but you need it to transition well. It does not in this film. I think they were trying to be like Aladdin, but the transitions between comedy and drama worked in that film. It does not here. This film is also like ancient Greece meets modern day Las Vegas. I mainly say that in the "Zero to Hero" song. You see all those flashing lights and lighting changes, and you see some modern-like products placed like "Herculade" and "Air-Herc". If I'm watching something that took place a very long time ago, I don't wanna see something similar to Gatorade. Sure, Aladdin had that too in the "Friend Like Me" song, but it makes sense because he has a magic genie. Here, it doesn't. But the reason I think it's decent is because, like I said, it does have a great story to tell. It's just told very weirdly. I also like the comedy in it. The scene where Pain and Panic are getting a lot of Hercules merchandise is really funny. Overall, this could've been a movie good enough to be considered one of Disney's best. It just had too many problems.

    So i picked this one up for 50% off at one of the local big box stores. My 4 year old daughter is in a real Disney phase right now, just devouring everything. We were at the point where we were picking up the more obscure Disney flicks from the 90's, like HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME and TARZAN (which we have found for dirt cheap!) I remembered seeing this back when it first came out in 97, and remember feeling like it was more of a boy movie, but for the price i figured "eh, if she even watches it once we got our money's worth out of it." My daughter had worn the DVDs for "SLEEPING BEAUTY" and "BEAUTY AND THE BEAST" right out, but neither of them compare to how much she loves "HERCULES"! Ever since i bought the movie a week ago she has watched the movie 2 times a day, each day, since then. It has trumped her love of every other Disney movie! I know a lot of people feel like Meg is a side character who doesn't really connect with most young girls, but my daughter looks at her as the absolute best Disney Princess of them all. I also have to say that "I won't say I'm in Love" has gotta be near the top of the list of the most under-appreciated, underrated Disney songs. My daughter keeps asking for me to replay that song over and over and over, and she dances up a storm to it. If you're thinking this movie might not appeal to the young Disney Princess in your life, think again. Really a gem for what you pay for it, right now!

    This movie is funny and really good but it isn't true Greek Mythology! Firstly the main character's name is HERACLES not HERCULES! Secondly he was a DEMIGOD not a GOD! And HERA wanted tho kill him instead of HADES! And the woman that Heracles liked was called DEIANIRA not MEGANA or MEG! And CHIRON trained him not PHIL! So you get the point. If you want to know about Greek mythology read a series of books called PERCY JACKSON or HEROES OF OLYMPUS. All in all this movie is funny and cute. It does have some real Greek Mythology in it though, but very little. The story teaches you that the strength of your heart is more important than strength itself. Thank you for reading.

    As a guy born in 1993, I grew up when Disney was putting out some classics. I.E. The Lion King, Aladdin, Toy Story, the list goes on and on. But I have to say, when you talk to people about Disney in the '90s, Hercules doesn't usually come up in conversation. I have no idea why. For those who denounce it for it's lack of mythical accuracy, what a bunch of garbage. Do you think Aladdin was historically accurate? Can lions talk? No, so what's the big deal with tweaking Greek Mythology in order to make a children's movie? There shouldn't be one. This movie is such a complete, feel good flick that it motivated me to write a review on here. I'm on this site every day without fail, and I've never felt enthused or irritated enough to post a review. Well I watched this movie again for the first time in years and I just had to. Incredible soundtrack, inspiring story, and great dynamic between the characters. Personally this is my favorite performance of James Woods. In fact, I'm not even a fan of James Woods but he is awesome in this, Hades is almost lovable as the main villain. This movie was as much fun for me at age 19 as it was when I saw it in theaters at age 4, probably even more enjoyable. Watch it despite what you've heard. Show your kids, I know I'm planning on it

    I just had to sign in to write up a review. Overall (Not Average): 8.5/10 Originality/Creativity: 9/10 It's a pretty neat and original story as compared to others of the time (1997). It gave a total twist to the female roles in typical Disney movies. The humour of Meg and Hades was really different too. Music: 8/10 I really love the Muses and the insert singing of Hercules and Meg. The lyrics also really suit the movie instead of taking insert songs, where the lyrics doesn't really "fit in". Of course there are also really good music/songs by other Disney movies too. They got really awesome music most the time, like Little Mermaid. Educational Purposes/Authenticity to Source: 2/10 I basically threw a random low score that makes me "feel" right. Hera isn't Hercules' mother. The "step-mother" was the real mother, at least according to Wikipedia. Hercules isn't a God, just a demi-god, which he stayed true to (in the end, sort of). Hercules had all those adventures, or "trials", which is "sort of" what Hercules in this movie did to become the "true hero". Basically, some facts are somewhat right but not for the right reasons. So it's pretty bad. Cautious Note for "Reviewers": It's really bad to put false information in a kid's movie. It's giving kids false info. But at the same time, it's a kid's movie. It's suppose to be childish, silly, not real and fantasy-like. This should be an element put aside. And to top it off, reviewing a kid's movie should be done by kid's who watched it at the age of 4-10 or whatever.

    Hercules was made in 1997 and Disney kinda lost its marbles a bit with this one and I'm gonna start off with the negative side first just to get it out of the way.......THE SONGS. I swear I do like I Can Go The Distance and I Won't Say I'm In Love,but the rest of the songs were just dreadful and the man who's responsible for this is ALAN MENKEN the same man that brought us Pocahontas,Beauty & The Beast,Enchanted and Tangled(which had a better score BTW). Its kinda confusing because the ending credits song was sung by Micheal Bolton(yeah that husky male singer who sings When A Man Loves A Woman)I mean what is the score suppose to represent Gospel Church Music or Pop music,cause I'm confused. Well alright enough about me bashing the songs what's the movie about well the movie is about a Greek God named Hercules(voiced first by Josh Keaton and later by Tate Donovan)who was sent to Earth by Hades and his sidekicks who are body shifters(they can literally turn themselves into humans or animals)cause Hades wants to rule the kingdom and his got a grudge against Hercules dad(voiced by Rip Thorn). Of course when Hercules grows up and becomes a hero(like Superman or Rocky)he meets a sly sarcastic woman named Meg(voiced by Broadway Singer and Actress Susan Egan)who's also very flirty,but is she for real or is she hiding something from Hercules. Bottom line I did enjoy Hercules for its animation and the charcthers were great(if I had to be honest I found Meg to be my favourite cause she was mysterious and sarcastic yet nice at the same time).One scene did have me laughing and it was when Meg said this I'm a damsel i'm in distress,I can handle this,have a nice day, that was funny. Overall is Hercules the best Disney movie ever NO its not its pretty above average,but do I like it yeah sure its a good flick,despite the fact the songs to its credit are good but some of them are just all over the place. So its a 6 from me.

    Listen. If this had ANYTHING to do with Hercules, I would be fine with it. This is just some strong guy with an evil blue guy after him. FIRST OF ALL: In REAL Greek Mythology, Hades wasn't evil. At all. In fact, he was actually considered to be the honest and protective god of Ancient Greece. This made him into their version of the devil, which he doesn't represent at all. Second: Hera is the villain. Sorry if you missed preschool, elementary school, middle school (if you have that where you live), and High School. And college. And never talked to anyone. But Hera was actually who was after Heracles (the actual spelling of Hercules, they messed that up too.), because he was born with a woman Zeus cheated on her with. In this, she is a loving mother who is afraid for her son. And third: Heracles is not a love story. At all. In fact, he's married already in mythology, but kills her. Yeah, sorry made up lady from the movie, but you never existed anywhere else, and your closest counterpart was killed viciously. Hades never dies, Heracles doesn't have a Pegasus, and Heracles eventually marries a goddess of youth, Hebe, and I think that in the movie it *SPOILERS NOW* ended with him staying on Earth with his girlfriend, but I'm just remembering that. *SPOILERS END* This is the only movie from Disney's prime time that I cannot stand.

    Ever since 1989 when they released The Little Mermaid, the Walt Disney Company had been on a roll with producing high quality animated features again. From such landmark animated features such as Beauty and the Beast to heavily underrated animated films like The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Disney had practically returned to top form. And while Disney's 1997 full-length animated feature Hercules may not bare comparison to the best Disney animated films that came out during that time, it's still an entertaining enough picture in its own unique way. The film starts with the Greek god Zeus (Rip Torn) and his wife Hera celebrating the birth of their son Hercules with the other gods of Olympus, including his evil brother Hades (James Woods). Hades wants to take over Mount Olympus and believes that Hercules will stand in his way. So, he sends his minions Pain and Panic to kidnap baby Hercules and make him drink a potion that will turn him mortal. However, young Hercules still obtains his unusual strength from Mount Olympus and becomes adopted by farmers. As he grows up, he has trouble fitting in with other people due to his strength and wants to finally find out where he came from in the first place. He is able to learn about his real past from Zeus' statue in the Temple of Zeus and also learns that he can reclaim his place on Mount Olympus if he can become a "true hero". Hercules is then sent to find a satyr by the name of Phil (Danny DeVito) who has been known to train some of the finest heroes Greece has ever seen, but has retired due to one letdown too many. But Hercules convinces him otherwise and Phil trains Hercules into a possible hero. When Hercules is older and ready, he and Phil decide to head for the dangerous city of Thebes so that Hercules can perform "heroic deeds" to get the attention of the Gods. On the way, Hercules meets a damsel-in-distress named Meg whom Hercules eventually starts to fall in love with even though he doesn't know that she's secretly Hades' minion. As Hercules starts to become a celebrity of sorts for all the "heroic deeds" he does for the citizens of Thebes, he eventually begins to realize what it really means to be a true hero. I personally thought it was kind of funny how the reason why Hercules was a misfit when he was a teenager was because he was too physically strong. I liked that scene when teenage Hercules accidentally destroys an entire temple (where Greek citizens hang out and apparently "shop" at as well) all for the innocent sake of catching a Frisbee. That scene in a way shows a potential downside to being unusually strong on a physical level. For the record, I'm not saying that exercising isn't important, I'm saying that excessive exercising might not be important. Another aspect about the story of Hercules that I liked was the message it was getting across. That message being that a true hero is someone who doesn't simply defeat many of their evil opponents, but is someone who does something brave that no normal person in their right mind would have the courage to do. In other words, a true hero is a person who does the right thing that no one else will ever do. While Hercules did stand up to enormous creatures that no one else would stand up to, it was, at first, technically more for showing off his strength rather than doing something beneficial for humanity. By far, the most interesting character in this entire picture is the villain Hades. Yes, I realize how clich&eacute;d picking the villain as the best character of a movie can be, but I can't help it. The villains are usually more fascinating characters than most heroes, and the villain in Hercules is no exception. I thought that the animation design of Hades in particular was really cool and the way the color of his flame/hair reflected his emotions (red symbolizing his anger, blue symbolizing that he's calm). But of course, James Woods' voice-over delivery is really what makes this character complete. I admire how Hades doesn't talk like your normal Disney villain would talk, but instead talks similar to a businessman. I don't think the story to Hercules is really that original save for a few little touches, and there are little to no surprises regarding where the plot will go. Just like most other Disney films, you can easily predict how everything will turn out in the end without any problems. I personally could have done without a few side characters particularly some of the sidekicks, like Pain and Panic, which were only created for the sole purpose of killing some screen time. Although I didn't mind the style of the animation or the music in this film, it may not be for everybody. I can understand where people are coming from when they say that they didn't care for the music. I will admit that black gospel music mixed with Greek mythology is an unusual mix to say the least. Personally, I found at least two songs that I liked and at least one song that I didn't care for. Some people say that the animation style is weird, but honestly, I wasn't too bothered by it either since I thought the style was unique. Overall, as far as Disney animated features go, Hercules is okay. It's light and fluffy, but it won't leave much of an impact as something like Beauty and the Beast did. If all that you need is simply an entertaining enough film to show to your kids, then Hercules should do the trick no problem.

    A Disney musical revolving around Greek mythology seems like a great idea. And in Disney's Hercules, the house of mouse makes great use of the famous characters and setting of Greek mythology. There's some hip, gospel songs and plenty of successful humor. So much works in this movie, but it's all sadly counter-balanced by everything that doesn't work. Hercules is born to the god and goddess, Zeus and Hera respectively. And while there is joy at his arrival, Hades wishes to do away with the baby, as his fortune reveals Hercules as a potential threat. Hades sends his two dim-witted minions, Pain and Panic to turn Hercules mortal, and then kill him. Unfortunately for Hades, Pain and Panic slip up when Hercules transformation from god to mortal gets stopped part way through, causing Hercules to retain his supernatural strength, but remain mortal. Hercules longs to be reunited with his parents and the other gods, though he cannot until he becomes a hero, which will then allow him to be turned back into a god. The set up for this story is extremely rushed, and feels almost tacked on. It's like Disney didn't want to spend much time developing the opening, and were more interested in cutting to the action. As a result, there isn't much at the beginning that's of interest, with the exception of one excellent gospel-style song, but I'll get to that later. The characters are mostly uninteresting. Hercules and the romantic interest, Megara (known as Meg) are almost completely personality-less, while Philoctetes (known as Phil), Hercules' trainer, is just a big grump. Only the villain, Hades, is at all interesting, even if he's basically just a hipper version of Jafar or Scar. Focusing less on story, Hercules relies on humor to get by. And while most of the humor is successful and funny, there aren't many big laughs here. Disney's next attempt at a hip comedy (The Emperor's New Groove) is a much more successful and enjoyable film. There's some curious character oversights, and some muddled messages here and there. There are dull stretches, and the action at the end is a bit excessive. Flaws are not hard to find. The songs are of ranging success. The majority of the songs are jazzy gospel tunes, complete with a group of African-American women singing the lyrics. Not only are these songs an innovative and refreshing concept, but the songs are fun and energetic too. It's hard to suppress a smile during these delightful numbers. And yet, there are two songs that don't fit into the gospel theme. They are entitled "Go the Distance" and "Our Last Hope." Both are relatively terrible and instantly forgettable. "Go the Distance" exists only to explain Hercules' desire to go home. This is the kind of song that could've been written in 5 minutes over lunch. "Our Last Hope" has a terrible rhythm and bland lyrics and is ultimately, a mess. It surprises me that a song was not provided for the villain, Hades. Just about every Disney films has had a song for the villain, so why did Hades have to miss out? His slick and sly personality would've been perfect for a nice jazzy beat. The voice cast is a mixed bag. Tate Donovan provides a bland voice for Hercules, and Danny DeVito does the same for Phil. Susan Egan's voice for Meg is much more unique. It's a shame there wasn't an interesting character to go with it. James Wood is wonderful as Hades, providing a perfectly sly and confident voice for the villain. The animation is detailed enough, but the animation style is a bit of a problem. The flat, geometric look just makes the animation appear cheap and lazy. CGI is occasionally integrated into the animation, and it looks great. Alan Menken's score is superb, if a little shy of his work in other Disney films of the time. Grand melodies and exciting action music make this score a success, even though it sounds a bit familiar to Menken's score for Aladdin. Sometimes funny, but riddled with flaws, Hercules is a disappointing Disney feature. As much as I wanted to like Hercules, there's just so much that doesn't work here. I felt uninterested in the characters and the story, and for most of the film, I was just waiting for the next toe-tapping gospel tune. The 90's was a great time for Disney, but Hercules may not be the best example of such success.

    As a guy born in 1993, I grew up when Disney was putting out some classics. I.E. The Lion King, Aladdin, Toy Story, the list goes on and on. But I have to say, when you talk to people about Disney in the '90s, Hercules doesn't usually come up in conversation. I have no idea why. For those who denounce it for it's lack of mythical accuracy, what a bunch of garbage. Do you think Aladdin was historically accurate? Can lions talk? No, so what's the big deal with tweaking Greek Mythology in order to make a children's movie? There shouldn't be one. This movie is such a complete, feel good flick that it motivated me to write a review on here. I'm on this site every day without fail, and I've never felt enthused or irritated enough to post a review. Well I watched this movie again for the first time in years and I just had to. Incredible soundtrack, inspiring story, and great dynamic between the characters. Personally this is my favorite performance of James Woods. In fact, I'm not even a fan of James Woods but he is awesome in this, Hades is almost lovable as the main villain. This movie was as much fun for me at age 19 as it was when I saw it in theaters at age 4, probably even more enjoyable. Watch it despite what you've heard. Show your kids, I know I'm planning on it

    I just had to sign in to write up a review. Overall (Not Average): 8.5/10 Originality/Creativity: 9/10 It's a pretty neat and original story as compared to others of the time (1997). It gave a total twist to the female roles in typical Disney movies. The humour of Meg and Hades was really different too. Music: 8/10 I really love the Muses and the insert singing of Hercules and Meg. The lyrics also really suit the movie instead of taking insert songs, where the lyrics doesn't really "fit in". Of course there are also really good music/songs by other Disney movies too. They got really awesome music most the time, like Little Mermaid. Educational Purposes/Authenticity to Source: 2/10 I basically threw a random low score that makes me "feel" right. Hera isn't Hercules' mother. The "step-mother" was the real mother, at least according to Wikipedia. Hercules isn't a God, just a demi-god, which he stayed true to (in the end, sort of). Hercules had all those adventures, or "trials", which is "sort of" what Hercules in this movie did to become the "true hero". Basically, some facts are somewhat right but not for the right reasons. So it's pretty bad. Cautious Note for "Reviewers": It's really bad to put false information in a kid's movie. It's giving kids false info. But at the same time, it's a kid's movie. It's suppose to be childish, silly, not real and fantasy-like. This should be an element put aside. And to top it off, reviewing a kid's movie should be done by kid's who watched it at the age of 4-10 or whatever.

    Hercules was made in 1997 and Disney kinda lost its marbles a bit with this one and I'm gonna start off with the negative side first just to get it out of the way.......THE SONGS. I swear I do like I Can Go The Distance and I Won't Say I'm In Love,but the rest of the songs were just dreadful and the man who's responsible for this is ALAN MENKEN the same man that brought us Pocahontas,Beauty & The Beast,Enchanted and Tangled(which had a better score BTW). Its kinda confusing because the ending credits song was sung by Micheal Bolton(yeah that husky male singer who sings When A Man Loves A Woman)I mean what is the score suppose to represent Gospel Church Music or Pop music,cause I'm confused. Well alright enough about me bashing the songs what's the movie about well the movie is about a Greek God named Hercules(voiced first by Josh Keaton and later by Tate Donovan)who was sent to Earth by Hades and his sidekicks who are body shifters(they can literally turn themselves into humans or animals)cause Hades wants to rule the kingdom and his got a grudge against Hercules dad(voiced by Rip Thorn). Of course when Hercules grows up and becomes a hero(like Superman or Rocky)he meets a sly sarcastic woman named Meg(voiced by Broadway Singer and Actress Susan Egan)who's also very flirty,but is she for real or is she hiding something from Hercules. Bottom line I did enjoy Hercules for its animation and the charcthers were great(if I had to be honest I found Meg to be my favourite cause she was mysterious and sarcastic yet nice at the same time).One scene did have me laughing and it was when Meg said this I'm a damsel i'm in distress,I can handle this,have a nice day, that was funny. Overall is Hercules the best Disney movie ever NO its not its pretty above average,but do I like it yeah sure its a good flick,despite the fact the songs to its credit are good but some of them are just all over the place. So its a 6 from me.

    Listen. If this had ANYTHING to do with Hercules, I would be fine with it. This is just some strong guy with an evil blue guy after him. FIRST OF ALL: In REAL Greek Mythology, Hades wasn't evil. At all. In fact, he was actually considered to be the honest and protective god of Ancient Greece. This made him into their version of the devil, which he doesn't represent at all. Second: Hera is the villain. Sorry if you missed preschool, elementary school, middle school (if you have that where you live), and High School. And college. And never talked to anyone. But Hera was actually who was after Heracles (the actual spelling of Hercules, they messed that up too.), because he was born with a woman Zeus cheated on her with. In this, she is a loving mother who is afraid for her son. And third: Heracles is not a love story. At all. In fact, he's married already in mythology, but kills her. Yeah, sorry made up lady from the movie, but you never existed anywhere else, and your closest counterpart was killed viciously. Hades never dies, Heracles doesn't have a Pegasus, and Heracles eventually marries a goddess of youth, Hebe, and I think that in the movie it *SPOILERS NOW* ended with him staying on Earth with his girlfriend, but I'm just remembering that. *SPOILERS END* This is the only movie from Disney's prime time that I cannot stand.

    Ever since 1989 when they released The Little Mermaid, the Walt Disney Company had been on a roll with producing high quality animated features again. From such landmark animated features such as Beauty and the Beast to heavily underrated animated films like The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Disney had practically returned to top form. And while Disney's 1997 full-length animated feature Hercules may not bare comparison to the best Disney animated films that came out during that time, it's still an entertaining enough picture in its own unique way. The film starts with the Greek god Zeus (Rip Torn) and his wife Hera celebrating the birth of their son Hercules with the other gods of Olympus, including his evil brother Hades (James Woods). Hades wants to take over Mount Olympus and believes that Hercules will stand in his way. So, he sends his minions Pain and Panic to kidnap baby Hercules and make him drink a potion that will turn him mortal. However, young Hercules still obtains his unusual strength from Mount Olympus and becomes adopted by farmers. As he grows up, he has trouble fitting in with other people due to his strength and wants to finally find out where he came from in the first place. He is able to learn about his real past from Zeus' statue in the Temple of Zeus and also learns that he can reclaim his place on Mount Olympus if he can become a "true hero". Hercules is then sent to find a satyr by the name of Phil (Danny DeVito) who has been known to train some of the finest heroes Greece has ever seen, but has retired due to one letdown too many. But Hercules convinces him otherwise and Phil trains Hercules into a possible hero. When Hercules is older and ready, he and Phil decide to head for the dangerous city of Thebes so that Hercules can perform "heroic deeds" to get the attention of the Gods. On the way, Hercules meets a damsel-in-distress named Meg whom Hercules eventually starts to fall in love with even though he doesn't know that she's secretly Hades' minion. As Hercules starts to become a celebrity of sorts for all the "heroic deeds" he does for the citizens of Thebes, he eventually begins to realize what it really means to be a true hero. I personally thought it was kind of funny how the reason why Hercules was a misfit when he was a teenager was because he was too physically strong. I liked that scene when teenage Hercules accidentally destroys an entire temple (where Greek citizens hang out and apparently "shop" at as well) all for the innocent sake of catching a Frisbee. That scene in a way shows a potential downside to being unusually strong on a physical level. For the record, I'm not saying that exercising isn't important, I'm saying that excessive exercising might not be important. Another aspect about the story of Hercules that I liked was the message it was getting across. That message being that a true hero is someone who doesn't simply defeat many of their evil opponents, but is someone who does something brave that no normal person in their right mind would have the courage to do. In other words, a true hero is a person who does the right thing that no one else will ever do. While Hercules did stand up to enormous creatures that no one else would stand up to, it was, at first, technically more for showing off his strength rather than doing something beneficial for humanity. By far, the most interesting character in this entire picture is the villain Hades. Yes, I realize how clich&eacute;d picking the villain as the best character of a movie can be, but I can't help it. The villains are usually more fascinating characters than most heroes, and the villain in Hercules is no exception. I thought that the animation design of Hades in particular was really cool and the way the color of his flame/hair reflected his emotions (red symbolizing his anger, blue symbolizing that he's calm). But of course, James Woods' voice-over delivery is really what makes this character complete. I admire how Hades doesn't talk like your normal Disney villain would talk, but instead talks similar to a businessman. I don't think the story to Hercules is really that original save for a few little touches, and there are little to no surprises regarding where the plot will go. Just like most other Disney films, you can easily predict how everything will turn out in the end without any problems. I personally could have done without a few side characters particularly some of the sidekicks, like Pain and Panic, which were only created for the sole purpose of killing some screen time. Although I didn't mind the style of the animation or the music in this film, it may not be for everybody. I can understand where people are coming from when they say that they didn't care for the music. I will admit that black gospel music mixed with Greek mythology is an unusual mix to say the least. Personally, I found at least two songs that I liked and at least one song that I didn't care for. Some people say that the animation style is weird, but honestly, I wasn't too bothered by it either since I thought the style was unique. Overall, as far as Disney animated features go, Hercules is okay. It's light and fluffy, but it won't leave much of an impact as something like Beauty and the Beast did. If all that you need is simply an entertaining enough film to show to your kids, then Hercules should do the trick no problem.

    A Disney musical revolving around Greek mythology seems like a great idea. And in Disney's Hercules, the house of mouse makes great use of the famous characters and setting of Greek mythology. There's some hip, gospel songs and plenty of successful humor. So much works in this movie, but it's all sadly counter-balanced by everything that doesn't work. Hercules is born to the god and goddess, Zeus and Hera respectively. And while there is joy at his arrival, Hades wishes to do away with the baby, as his fortune reveals Hercules as a potential threat. Hades sends his two dim-witted minions, Pain and Panic to turn Hercules mortal, and then kill him. Unfortunately for Hades, Pain and Panic slip up when Hercules transformation from god to mortal gets stopped part way through, causing Hercules to retain his supernatural strength, but remain mortal. Hercules longs to be reunited with his parents and the other gods, though he cannot until he becomes a hero, which will then allow him to be turned back into a god. The set up for this story is extremely rushed, and feels almost tacked on. It's like Disney didn't want to spend much time developing the opening, and were more interested in cutting to the action. As a result, there isn't much at the beginning that's of interest, with the exception of one excellent gospel-style song, but I'll get to that later. The characters are mostly uninteresting. Hercules and the romantic interest, Megara (known as Meg) are almost completely personality-less, while Philoctetes (known as Phil), Hercules' trainer, is just a big grump. Only the villain, Hades, is at all interesting, even if he's basically just a hipper version of Jafar or Scar. Focusing less on story, Hercules relies on humor to get by. And while most of the humor is successful and funny, there aren't many big laughs here. Disney's next attempt at a hip comedy (The Emperor's New Groove) is a much more successful and enjoyable film. There's some curious character oversights, and some muddled messages here and there. There are dull stretches, and the action at the end is a bit excessive. Flaws are not hard to find. The songs are of ranging success. The majority of the songs are jazzy gospel tunes, complete with a group of African-American women singing the lyrics. Not only are these songs an innovative and refreshing concept, but the songs are fun and energetic too. It's hard to suppress a smile during these delightful numbers. And yet, there are two songs that don't fit into the gospel theme. They are entitled "Go the Distance" and "Our Last Hope." Both are relatively terrible and instantly forgettable. "Go the Distance" exists only to explain Hercules' desire to go home. This is the kind of song that could've been written in 5 minutes over lunch. "Our Last Hope" has a terrible rhythm and bland lyrics and is ultimately, a mess. It surprises me that a song was not provided for the villain, Hades. Just about every Disney films has had a song for the villain, so why did Hades have to miss out? His slick and sly personality would've been perfect for a nice jazzy beat. The voice cast is a mixed bag. Tate Donovan provides a bland voice for Hercules, and Danny DeVito does the same for Phil. Susan Egan's voice for Meg is much more unique. It's a shame there wasn't an interesting character to go with it. James Wood is wonderful as Hades, providing a perfectly sly and confident voice for the villain. The animation is detailed enough, but the animation style is a bit of a problem. The flat, geometric look just makes the animation appear cheap and lazy. CGI is occasionally integrated into the animation, and it looks great. Alan Menken's score is superb, if a little shy of his work in other Disney films of the time. Grand melodies and exciting action music make this score a success, even though it sounds a bit familiar to Menken's score for Aladdin. Sometimes funny, but riddled with flaws, Hercules is a disappointing Disney feature. As much as I wanted to like Hercules, there's just so much that doesn't work here. I felt uninterested in the characters and the story, and for most of the film, I was just waiting for the next toe-tapping gospel tune. The 90's was a great time for Disney, but Hercules may not be the best example of such success.

    I absolutely adore this movie, and I believe it is one of the most underrated Disney movies, especially of the renaissance. It's full of the ingredients to make a perfect Disney movie: Comedy (thank you, James Woods/The Muses), a brilliant role model for young girls (Megara), and catchy songs, which you know already. It sucks that this movie doesn't get the recognition it deserves. Although I think that almost everything that comes out of the Disney studios is pure wonderful (with the exception of Cars....yikes), this is definitely a stand out in what they did. I'd even go as far as to say that this movie trumps one of Disney's classics of the 90's - Aladdin. Maybe it just wasn't marketed properly, but I believe this should be up there with the greats. In short, I love this movie, as I've mentioned 500 times already. My 3rd favourite in my list of Disney movies, and very hard to shove from that position. And who put the glad in gladiator?

    I am a person who really enjoys Disney films, despite my age. (I'm 20.) Some people say that Hercules was the film that killed people's interest in animated Disney films after Pocahontas and The Hunchback of Notre Dame came out. I personally believe that it was a decent film. However, I think it could've turned out to be one of their best movies. It had the story to do it, and it also had a very funny, plus popular villain in Hades. It just turned out to be very problematic. First off, I think the way the story is told is very odd. You have 5 women, who are known as "The Muses". They basically tell the beginning of the film in song, introduce us to Hades, and you see them appear during the movie. You see them have a song when Hercules is becoming popular, when Hercules' love interest, Meg, is trying to decide whether she's in love or not, and at the end of the film after Hercules stopped Hades. They act very surprised each time they appear. "Oh my god, Hercules is becoming popular! Oh wow, he stopped Hades!" I think if the Muses weren't telling the story, and it was told without continuing narration, this film would be considered a classic. I also have a problem with the transitions. At one point, the film is trying to be a comedy, and the other, it's dramatic. You can put them into a film, but you need it to transition well. It does not in this film. I think they were trying to be like Aladdin, but the transitions between comedy and drama worked in that film. It does not here. This film is also like ancient Greece meets modern day Las Vegas. I mainly say that in the "Zero to Hero" song. You see all those flashing lights and lighting changes, and you see some modern-like products placed like "Herculade" and "Air-Herc". If I'm watching something that took place a very long time ago, I don't wanna see something similar to Gatorade. Sure, Aladdin had that too in the "Friend Like Me" song, but it makes sense because he has a magic genie. Here, it doesn't. But the reason I think it's decent is because, like I said, it does have a great story to tell. It's just told very weirdly. I also like the comedy in it. The scene where Pain and Panic are getting a lot of Hercules merchandise is really funny. Overall, this could've been a movie good enough to be considered one of Disney's best. It just had too many problems.

    So i picked this one up for 50% off at one of the local big box stores. My 4 year old daughter is in a real Disney phase right now, just devouring everything. We were at the point where we were picking up the more obscure Disney flicks from the 90's, like HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME and TARZAN (which we have found for dirt cheap!) I remembered seeing this back when it first came out in 97, and remember feeling like it was more of a boy movie, but for the price i figured "eh, if she even watches it once we got our money's worth out of it." My daughter had worn the DVDs for "SLEEPING BEAUTY" and "BEAUTY AND THE BEAST" right out, but neither of them compare to how much she loves "HERCULES"! Ever since i bought the movie a week ago she has watched the movie 2 times a day, each day, since then. It has trumped her love of every other Disney movie! I know a lot of people feel like Meg is a side character who doesn't really connect with most young girls, but my daughter looks at her as the absolute best Disney Princess of them all. I also have to say that "I won't say I'm in Love" has gotta be near the top of the list of the most under-appreciated, underrated Disney songs. My daughter keeps asking for me to replay that song over and over and over, and she dances up a storm to it. If you're thinking this movie might not appeal to the young Disney Princess in your life, think again. Really a gem for what you pay for it, right now!

    This movie is funny and really good but it isn't true Greek Mythology! Firstly the main character's name is HERACLES not HERCULES! Secondly he was a DEMIGOD not a GOD! And HERA wanted tho kill him instead of HADES! And the woman that Heracles liked was called DEIANIRA not MEGANA or MEG! And CHIRON trained him not PHIL! So you get the point. If you want to know about Greek mythology read a series of books called PERCY JACKSON or HEROES OF OLYMPUS. All in all this movie is funny and cute. It does have some real Greek Mythology in it though, but very little. The story teaches you that the strength of your heart is more important than strength itself. Thank you for reading.

    Ever since 1989 when they released The Little Mermaid, the Walt Disney Company had been on a roll with producing high quality animated features again. From such landmark animated features such as Beauty and the Beast to heavily underrated animated films like The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Disney had practically returned to top form. And while Disney's 1997 full-length animated feature Hercules may not bare comparison to the best Disney animated films that came out during that time, it's still an entertaining enough picture in its own unique way. The film starts with the Greek god Zeus (Rip Torn) and his wife Hera celebrating the birth of their son Hercules with the other gods of Olympus, including his evil brother Hades (James Woods). Hades wants to take over Mount Olympus and believes that Hercules will stand in his way. So, he sends his minions Pain and Panic to kidnap baby Hercules and make him drink a potion that will turn him mortal. However, young Hercules still obtains his unusual strength from Mount Olympus and becomes adopted by farmers. As he grows up, he has trouble fitting in with other people due to his strength and wants to finally find out where he came from in the first place. He is able to learn about his real past from Zeus' statue in the Temple of Zeus and also learns that he can reclaim his place on Mount Olympus if he can become a "true hero". Hercules is then sent to find a satyr by the name of Phil (Danny DeVito) who has been known to train some of the finest heroes Greece has ever seen, but has retired due to one letdown too many. But Hercules convinces him otherwise and Phil trains Hercules into a possible hero. When Hercules is older and ready, he and Phil decide to head for the dangerous city of Thebes so that Hercules can perform "heroic deeds" to get the attention of the Gods. On the way, Hercules meets a damsel-in-distress named Meg whom Hercules eventually starts to fall in love with even though he doesn't know that she's secretly Hades' minion. As Hercules starts to become a celebrity of sorts for all the "heroic deeds" he does for the citizens of Thebes, he eventually begins to realize what it really means to be a true hero. I personally thought it was kind of funny how the reason why Hercules was a misfit when he was a teenager was because he was too physically strong. I liked that scene when teenage Hercules accidentally destroys an entire temple (where Greek citizens hang out and apparently "shop" at as well) all for the innocent sake of catching a Frisbee. That scene in a way shows a potential downside to being unusually strong on a physical level. For the record, I'm not saying that exercising isn't important, I'm saying that excessive exercising might not be important. Another aspect about the story of Hercules that I liked was the message it was getting across. That message being that a true hero is someone who doesn't simply defeat many of their evil opponents, but is someone who does something brave that no normal person in their right mind would have the courage to do. In other words, a true hero is a person who does the right thing that no one else will ever do. While Hercules did stand up to enormous creatures that no one else would stand up to, it was, at first, technically more for showing off his strength rather than doing something beneficial for humanity. By far, the most interesting character in this entire picture is the villain Hades. Yes, I realize how clich&eacute;d picking the villain as the best character of a movie can be, but I can't help it. The villains are usually more fascinating characters than most heroes, and the villain in Hercules is no exception. I thought that the animation design of Hades in particular was really cool and the way the color of his flame/hair reflected his emotions (red symbolizing his anger, blue symbolizing that he's calm). But of course, James Woods' voice-over delivery is really what makes this character complete. I admire how Hades doesn't talk like your normal Disney villain would talk, but instead talks similar to a businessman. I don't think the story to Hercules is really that original save for a few little touches, and there are little to no surprises regarding where the plot will go. Just like most other Disney films, you can easily predict how everything will turn out in the end without any problems. I personally could have done without a few side characters particularly some of the sidekicks, like Pain and Panic, which were only created for the sole purpose of killing some screen time. Although I didn't mind the style of the animation or the music in this film, it may not be for everybody. I can understand where people are coming from when they say that they didn't care for the music. I will admit that black gospel music mixed with Greek mythology is an unusual mix to say the least. Personally, I found at least two songs that I liked and at least one song that I didn't care for. Some people say that the animation style is weird, but honestly, I wasn't too bothered by it either since I thought the style was unique. Overall, as far as Disney animated features go, Hercules is okay. It's light and fluffy, but it won't leave much of an impact as something like Beauty and the Beast did. If all that you need is simply an entertaining enough film to show to your kids, then Hercules should do the trick no problem.

    A Disney musical revolving around Greek mythology seems like a great idea. And in Disney's Hercules, the house of mouse makes great use of the famous characters and setting of Greek mythology. There's some hip, gospel songs and plenty of successful humor. So much works in this movie, but it's all sadly counter-balanced by everything that doesn't work. Hercules is born to the god and goddess, Zeus and Hera respectively. And while there is joy at his arrival, Hades wishes to do away with the baby, as his fortune reveals Hercules as a potential threat. Hades sends his two dim-witted minions, Pain and Panic to turn Hercules mortal, and then kill him. Unfortunately for Hades, Pain and Panic slip up when Hercules transformation from god to mortal gets stopped part way through, causing Hercules to retain his supernatural strength, but remain mortal. Hercules longs to be reunited with his parents and the other gods, though he cannot until he becomes a hero, which will then allow him to be turned back into a god. The set up for this story is extremely rushed, and feels almost tacked on. It's like Disney didn't want to spend much time developing the opening, and were more interested in cutting to the action. As a result, there isn't much at the beginning that's of interest, with the exception of one excellent gospel-style song, but I'll get to that later. The characters are mostly uninteresting. Hercules and the romantic interest, Megara (known as Meg) are almost completely personality-less, while Philoctetes (known as Phil), Hercules' trainer, is just a big grump. Only the villain, Hades, is at all interesting, even if he's basically just a hipper version of Jafar or Scar. Focusing less on story, Hercules relies on humor to get by. And while most of the humor is successful and funny, there aren't many big laughs here. Disney's next attempt at a hip comedy (The Emperor's New Groove) is a much more successful and enjoyable film. There's some curious character oversights, and some muddled messages here and there. There are dull stretches, and the action at the end is a bit excessive. Flaws are not hard to find. The songs are of ranging success. The majority of the songs are jazzy gospel tunes, complete with a group of African-American women singing the lyrics. Not only are these songs an innovative and refreshing concept, but the songs are fun and energetic too. It's hard to suppress a smile during these delightful numbers. And yet, there are two songs that don't fit into the gospel theme. They are entitled "Go the Distance" and "Our Last Hope." Both are relatively terrible and instantly forgettable. "Go the Distance" exists only to explain Hercules' desire to go home. This is the kind of song that could've been written in 5 minutes over lunch. "Our Last Hope" has a terrible rhythm and bland lyrics and is ultimately, a mess. It surprises me that a song was not provided for the villain, Hades. Just about every Disney films has had a song for the villain, so why did Hades have to miss out? His slick and sly personality would've been perfect for a nice jazzy beat. The voice cast is a mixed bag. Tate Donovan provides a bland voice for Hercules, and Danny DeVito does the same for Phil. Susan Egan's voice for Meg is much more unique. It's a shame there wasn't an interesting character to go with it. James Wood is wonderful as Hades, providing a perfectly sly and confident voice for the villain. The animation is detailed enough, but the animation style is a bit of a problem. The flat, geometric look just makes the animation appear cheap and lazy. CGI is occasionally integrated into the animation, and it looks great. Alan Menken's score is superb, if a little shy of his work in other Disney films of the time. Grand melodies and exciting action music make this score a success, even though it sounds a bit familiar to Menken's score for Aladdin. Sometimes funny, but riddled with flaws, Hercules is a disappointing Disney feature. As much as I wanted to like Hercules, there's just so much that doesn't work here. I felt uninterested in the characters and the story, and for most of the film, I was just waiting for the next toe-tapping gospel tune. The 90's was a great time for Disney, but Hercules may not be the best example of such success.

    I absolutely adore this movie, and I believe it is one of the most underrated Disney movies, especially of the renaissance. It's full of the ingredients to make a perfect Disney movie: Comedy (thank you, James Woods/The Muses), a brilliant role model for young girls (Megara), and catchy songs, which you know already. It sucks that this movie doesn't get the recognition it deserves. Although I think that almost everything that comes out of the Disney studios is pure wonderful (with the exception of Cars....yikes), this is definitely a stand out in what they did. I'd even go as far as to say that this movie trumps one of Disney's classics of the 90's - Aladdin. Maybe it just wasn't marketed properly, but I believe this should be up there with the greats. In short, I love this movie, as I've mentioned 500 times already. My 3rd favourite in my list of Disney movies, and very hard to shove from that position. And who put the glad in gladiator?

    I am a person who really enjoys Disney films, despite my age. (I'm 20.) Some people say that Hercules was the film that killed people's interest in animated Disney films after Pocahontas and The Hunchback of Notre Dame came out. I personally believe that it was a decent film. However, I think it could've turned out to be one of their best movies. It had the story to do it, and it also had a very funny, plus popular villain in Hades. It just turned out to be very problematic. First off, I think the way the story is told is very odd. You have 5 women, who are known as "The Muses". They basically tell the beginning of the film in song, introduce us to Hades, and you see them appear during the movie. You see them have a song when Hercules is becoming popular, when Hercules' love interest, Meg, is trying to decide whether she's in love or not, and at the end of the film after Hercules stopped Hades. They act very surprised each time they appear. "Oh my god, Hercules is becoming popular! Oh wow, he stopped Hades!" I think if the Muses weren't telling the story, and it was told without continuing narration, this film would be considered a classic. I also have a problem with the transitions. At one point, the film is trying to be a comedy, and the other, it's dramatic. You can put them into a film, but you need it to transition well. It does not in this film. I think they were trying to be like Aladdin, but the transitions between comedy and drama worked in that film. It does not here. This film is also like ancient Greece meets modern day Las Vegas. I mainly say that in the "Zero to Hero" song. You see all those flashing lights and lighting changes, and you see some modern-like products placed like "Herculade" and "Air-Herc". If I'm watching something that took place a very long time ago, I don't wanna see something similar to Gatorade. Sure, Aladdin had that too in the "Friend Like Me" song, but it makes sense because he has a magic genie. Here, it doesn't. But the reason I think it's decent is because, like I said, it does have a great story to tell. It's just told very weirdly. I also like the comedy in it. The scene where Pain and Panic are getting a lot of Hercules merchandise is really funny. Overall, this could've been a movie good enough to be considered one of Disney's best. It just had too many problems.

    So i picked this one up for 50% off at one of the local big box stores. My 4 year old daughter is in a real Disney phase right now, just devouring everything. We were at the point where we were picking up the more obscure Disney flicks from the 90's, like HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME and TARZAN (which we have found for dirt cheap!) I remembered seeing this back when it first came out in 97, and remember feeling like it was more of a boy movie, but for the price i figured "eh, if she even watches it once we got our money's worth out of it." My daughter had worn the DVDs for "SLEEPING BEAUTY" and "BEAUTY AND THE BEAST" right out, but neither of them compare to how much she loves "HERCULES"! Ever since i bought the movie a week ago she has watched the movie 2 times a day, each day, since then. It has trumped her love of every other Disney movie! I know a lot of people feel like Meg is a side character who doesn't really connect with most young girls, but my daughter looks at her as the absolute best Disney Princess of them all. I also have to say that "I won't say I'm in Love" has gotta be near the top of the list of the most under-appreciated, underrated Disney songs. My daughter keeps asking for me to replay that song over and over and over, and she dances up a storm to it. If you're thinking this movie might not appeal to the young Disney Princess in your life, think again. Really a gem for what you pay for it, right now!

    This movie is funny and really good but it isn't true Greek Mythology! Firstly the main character's name is HERACLES not HERCULES! Secondly he was a DEMIGOD not a GOD! And HERA wanted tho kill him instead of HADES! And the woman that Heracles liked was called DEIANIRA not MEGANA or MEG! And CHIRON trained him not PHIL! So you get the point. If you want to know about Greek mythology read a series of books called PERCY JACKSON or HEROES OF OLYMPUS. All in all this movie is funny and cute. It does have some real Greek Mythology in it though, but very little. The story teaches you that the strength of your heart is more important than strength itself. Thank you for reading.

    As a guy born in 1993, I grew up when Disney was putting out some classics. I.E. The Lion King, Aladdin, Toy Story, the list goes on and on. But I have to say, when you talk to people about Disney in the '90s, Hercules doesn't usually come up in conversation. I have no idea why. For those who denounce it for it's lack of mythical accuracy, what a bunch of garbage. Do you think Aladdin was historically accurate? Can lions talk? No, so what's the big deal with tweaking Greek Mythology in order to make a children's movie? There shouldn't be one. This movie is such a complete, feel good flick that it motivated me to write a review on here. I'm on this site every day without fail, and I've never felt enthused or irritated enough to post a review. Well I watched this movie again for the first time in years and I just had to. Incredible soundtrack, inspiring story, and great dynamic between the characters. Personally this is my favorite performance of James Woods. In fact, I'm not even a fan of James Woods but he is awesome in this, Hades is almost lovable as the main villain. This movie was as much fun for me at age 19 as it was when I saw it in theaters at age 4, probably even more enjoyable. Watch it despite what you've heard. Show your kids, I know I'm planning on it

    I just had to sign in to write up a review. Overall (Not Average): 8.5/10 Originality/Creativity: 9/10 It's a pretty neat and original story as compared to others of the time (1997). It gave a total twist to the female roles in typical Disney movies. The humour of Meg and Hades was really different too. Music: 8/10 I really love the Muses and the insert singing of Hercules and Meg. The lyrics also really suit the movie instead of taking insert songs, where the lyrics doesn't really "fit in". Of course there are also really good music/songs by other Disney movies too. They got really awesome music most the time, like Little Mermaid. Educational Purposes/Authenticity to Source: 2/10 I basically threw a random low score that makes me "feel" right. Hera isn't Hercules' mother. The "step-mother" was the real mother, at least according to Wikipedia. Hercules isn't a God, just a demi-god, which he stayed true to (in the end, sort of). Hercules had all those adventures, or "trials", which is "sort of" what Hercules in this movie did to become the "true hero". Basically, some facts are somewhat right but not for the right reasons. So it's pretty bad. Cautious Note for "Reviewers": It's really bad to put false information in a kid's movie. It's giving kids false info. But at the same time, it's a kid's movie. It's suppose to be childish, silly, not real and fantasy-like. This should be an element put aside. And to top it off, reviewing a kid's movie should be done by kid's who watched it at the age of 4-10 or whatever.

    Hercules was made in 1997 and Disney kinda lost its marbles a bit with this one and I'm gonna start off with the negative side first just to get it out of the way.......THE SONGS. I swear I do like I Can Go The Distance and I Won't Say I'm In Love,but the rest of the songs were just dreadful and the man who's responsible for this is ALAN MENKEN the same man that brought us Pocahontas,Beauty & The Beast,Enchanted and Tangled(which had a better score BTW). Its kinda confusing because the ending credits song was sung by Micheal Bolton(yeah that husky male singer who sings When A Man Loves A Woman)I mean what is the score suppose to represent Gospel Church Music or Pop music,cause I'm confused. Well alright enough about me bashing the songs what's the movie about well the movie is about a Greek God named Hercules(voiced first by Josh Keaton and later by Tate Donovan)who was sent to Earth by Hades and his sidekicks who are body shifters(they can literally turn themselves into humans or animals)cause Hades wants to rule the kingdom and his got a grudge against Hercules dad(voiced by Rip Thorn). Of course when Hercules grows up and becomes a hero(like Superman or Rocky)he meets a sly sarcastic woman named Meg(voiced by Broadway Singer and Actress Susan Egan)who's also very flirty,but is she for real or is she hiding something from Hercules. Bottom line I did enjoy Hercules for its animation and the charcthers were great(if I had to be honest I found Meg to be my favourite cause she was mysterious and sarcastic yet nice at the same time).One scene did have me laughing and it was when Meg said this I'm a damsel i'm in distress,I can handle this,have a nice day, that was funny. Overall is Hercules the best Disney movie ever NO its not its pretty above average,but do I like it yeah sure its a good flick,despite the fact the songs to its credit are good but some of them are just all over the place. So its a 6 from me.

    Listen. If this had ANYTHING to do with Hercules, I would be fine with it. This is just some strong guy with an evil blue guy after him. FIRST OF ALL: In REAL Greek Mythology, Hades wasn't evil. At all. In fact, he was actually considered to be the honest and protective god of Ancient Greece. This made him into their version of the devil, which he doesn't represent at all. Second: Hera is the villain. Sorry if you missed preschool, elementary school, middle school (if you have that where you live), and High School. And college. And never talked to anyone. But Hera was actually who was after Heracles (the actual spelling of Hercules, they messed that up too.), because he was born with a woman Zeus cheated on her with. In this, she is a loving mother who is afraid for her son. And third: Heracles is not a love story. At all. In fact, he's married already in mythology, but kills her. Yeah, sorry made up lady from the movie, but you never existed anywhere else, and your closest counterpart was killed viciously. Hades never dies, Heracles doesn't have a Pegasus, and Heracles eventually marries a goddess of youth, Hebe, and I think that in the movie it *SPOILERS NOW* ended with him staying on Earth with his girlfriend, but I'm just remembering that. *SPOILERS END* This is the only movie from Disney's prime time that I cannot stand.

Just about every Disney films has had a song for the villain, so why did Hades have to miss out? His slick and sly personality would've been perfect for a nice jazzy beat. The voice cast is a mixed bag. Tate Donovan provides a bland voice for Hercules, and Danny DeVito does the same for Phil. Susan Egan's voice for Meg is much more unique. It's a shame there wasn't an interesting character to go with it. James Wood is wonderful as Hades, providing a perfectly sly and confident voice for the villain. The animation is detailed enough, but the animation style is a bit of a problem. The flat, geometric look just makes the animation appear cheap and lazy. CGI is occasionally integrated into the animation, and it looks great. Alan Menken's score is superb, if a little shy of his work in other Disney films of the time. Grand melodies and exciting action music make this score a success, even though it sounds a bit familiar to Menken's score for Aladdin. Sometimes funny, but riddled with flaws, Hercules is a disappointing Disney feature. As much as I wanted to like Hercules, there's just so much that doesn't work here. I felt uninterested in the characters and the story, and for most of the film, I was just waiting for the next toe-tapping gospel tune. The 90's was a great time for Disney, but Hercules may not be the best example of such success.

    I absolutely adore this movie, and I believe it is one of the most underrated Disney movies, especially of the renaissance. It's full of the ingredients to make a perfect Disney movie: Comedy (thank you, James Woods/The Muses), a brilliant role model for young girls (Megara), and catchy songs, which you know already. It sucks that this movie doesn't get the recognition it deserves. Although I think that almost everything that comes out of the Disney studios is pure wonderful (with the exception of Cars....yikes), this is definitely a stand out in what they did. I'd even go as far as to say that this movie trumps one of Disney's classics of the 90's - Aladdin. Maybe it just wasn't marketed properly, but I believe this should be up there with the greats. In short, I love this movie, as I've mentioned 500 times already. My 3rd favourite in my list of Disney movies, and very hard to shove from that position. And who put the glad in gladiator?

    I am a person who really enjoys Disney films, despite my age. (I'm 20.) Some people say that Hercules was the film that killed people's interest in animated Disney films after Pocahontas and The Hunchback of Notre Dame came out. I personally believe that it was a decent film. However, I think it could've turned out to be one of their best movies. It had the story to do it, and it also had a very funny, plus popular villain in Hades. It just turned out to be very problematic. First off, I think the way the story is told is very odd. You have 5 women, who are known as "The Muses". They basically tell the beginning of the film in song, introduce us to Hades, and you see them appear during the movie. You see them have a song when Hercules is becoming popular, when Hercules' love interest, Meg, is trying to decide whether she's in love or not, and at the end of the film after Hercules stopped Hades. They act very surprised each time they appear. "Oh my god, Hercules is becoming popular! Oh wow, he stopped Hades!" I think if the Muses weren't telling the story, and it was told without continuing narration, this film would be considered a classic. I also have a problem with the transitions. At one point, the film is trying to be a comedy, and the other, it's dramatic. You can put them into a film, but you need it to transition well. It does not in this film. I think they were trying to be like Aladdin, but the transitions between comedy and drama worked in that film. It does not here. This film is also like ancient Greece meets modern day Las Vegas. I mainly say that in the "Zero to Hero" song. You see all those flashing lights and lighting changes, and you see some modern-like products placed like "Herculade" and "Air-Herc". If I'm watching something that took place a very long time ago, I don't wanna see something similar to Gatorade. Sure, Aladdin had that too in the "Friend Like Me" song, but it makes sense because he has a magic genie. Here, it doesn't. But the reason I think it's decent is because, like I said, it does have a great story to tell. It's just told very weirdly. I also like the comedy in it. The scene where Pain and Panic are getting a lot of Hercules merchandise is really funny. Overall, this could've been a movie good enough to be considered one of Disney's best. It just had too many problems.

    So i picked this one up for 50% off at one of the local big box stores. My 4 year old daughter is in a real Disney phase right now, just devouring everything. We were at the point where we were picking up the more obscure Disney flicks from the 90's, like HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME and TARZAN (which we have found for dirt cheap!) I remembered seeing this back when it first came out in 97, and remember feeling like it was more of a boy movie, but for the price i figured "eh, if she even watches it once we got our money's worth out of it." My daughter had worn the DVDs for "SLEEPING BEAUTY" and "BEAUTY AND THE BEAST" right out, but neither of them compare to how much she loves "HERCULES"! Ever since i bought the movie a week ago she has watched the movie 2 times a day, each day, since then. It has trumped her love of every other Disney movie! I know a lot of people feel like Meg is a side character who doesn't really connect with most young girls, but my daughter looks at her as the absolute best Disney Princess of them all. I also have to say that "I won't say I'm in Love" has gotta be near the top of the list of the most under-appreciated, underrated Disney songs. My daughter keeps asking for me to replay that song over and over and over, and she dances up a storm to it. If you're thinking this movie might not appeal to the young Disney Princess in your life, think again. Really a gem for what you pay for it, right now!

    This movie is funny and really good but it isn't true Greek Mythology! Firstly the main character's name is HERACLES not HERCULES! Secondly he was a DEMIGOD not a GOD! And HERA wanted tho kill him instead of HADES! And the woman that Heracles liked was called DEIANIRA not MEGANA or MEG! And CHIRON trained him not PHIL! So you get the point. If you want to know about Greek mythology read a series of books called PERCY JACKSON or HEROES OF OLYMPUS. All in all this movie is funny and cute. It does have some real Greek Mythology in it though, but very little. The story teaches you that the strength of your heart is more important than strength itself. Thank you for reading.

    As a guy born in 1993, I grew up when Disney was putting out some classics. I.E. The Lion King, Aladdin, Toy Story, the list goes on and on. But I have to say, when you talk to people about Disney in the '90s, Hercules doesn't usually come up in conversation. I have no idea why. For those who denounce it for it's lack of mythical accuracy, what a bunch of garbage. Do you think Aladdin was historically accurate? Can lions talk? No, so what's the big deal with tweaking Greek Mythology in order to make a children's movie? There shouldn't be one. This movie is such a complete, feel good flick that it motivated me to write a review on here. I'm on this site every day without fail, and I've never felt enthused or irritated enough to post a review. Well I watched this movie again for the first time in years and I just had to. Incredible soundtrack, inspiring story, and great dynamic between the characters. Personally this is my favorite performance of James Woods. In fact, I'm not even a fan of James Woods but he is awesome in this, Hades is almost lovable as the main villain. This movie was as much fun for me at age 19 as it was when I saw it in theaters at age 4, probably even more enjoyable. Watch it despite what you've heard. Show your kids, I know I'm planning on it

    I just had to sign in to write up a review. Overall (Not Average): 8.5/10 Originality/Creativity: 9/10 It's a pretty neat and original story as compared to others of the time (1997). It gave a total twist to the female roles in typical Disney movies. The humour of Meg and Hades was really different too. Music: 8/10 I really love the Muses and the insert singing of Hercules and Meg. The lyrics also really suit the movie instead of taking insert songs, where the lyrics doesn't really "fit in". Of course there are also really good music/songs by other Disney movies too. They got really awesome music most the time, like Little Mermaid. Educational Purposes/Authenticity to Source: 2/10 I basically threw a random low score that makes me "feel" right. Hera isn't Hercules' mother. The "step-mother" was the real mother, at least according to Wikipedia. Hercules isn't a God, just a demi-god, which he stayed true to (in the end, sort of). Hercules had all those adventures, or "trials", which is "sort of" what Hercules in this movie did to become the "true hero". Basically, some facts are somewhat right but not for the right reasons. So it's pretty bad. Cautious Note for "Reviewers": It's really bad to put false information in a kid's movie. It's giving kids false info. But at the same time, it's a kid's movie. It's suppose to be childish, silly, not real and fantasy-like. This should be an element put aside. And to top it off, reviewing a kid's movie should be done by kid's who watched it at the age of 4-10 or whatever.

    Hercules was made in 1997 and Disney kinda lost its marbles a bit with this one and I'm gonna start off with the negative side first just to get it out of the way.......THE SONGS. I swear I do like I Can Go The Distance and I Won't Say I'm In Love,but the rest of the songs were just dreadful and the man who's responsible for this is ALAN MENKEN the same man that brought us Pocahontas,Beauty & The Beast,Enchanted and Tangled(which had a better score BTW). Its kinda confusing because the ending credits song was sung by Micheal Bolton(yeah that husky male singer who sings When A Man Loves A Woman)I mean what is the score suppose to represent Gospel Church Music or Pop music,cause I'm confused. Well alright enough about me bashing the songs what's the movie about well the movie is about a Greek God named Hercules(voiced first by Josh Keaton and later by Tate Donovan)who was sent to Earth by Hades and his sidekicks who are body shifters(they can literally turn themselves into humans or animals)cause Hades wants to rule the kingdom and his got a grudge against Hercules dad(voiced by Rip Thorn). Of course when Hercules grows up and becomes a hero(like Superman or Rocky)he meets a sly sarcastic woman named Meg(voiced by Broadway Singer and Actress Susan Egan)who's also very flirty,but is she for real or is she hiding something from Hercules. Bottom line I did enjoy Hercules for its animation and the charcthers were great(if I had to be honest I found Meg to be my favourite cause she was mysterious and sarcastic yet nice at the same time).One scene did have me laughing and it was when Meg said this I'm a damsel i'm in distress,I can handle this,have a nice day, that was funny. Overall is Hercules the best Disney movie ever NO its not its pretty above average,but do I like it yeah sure its a good flick,despite the fact the songs to its credit are good but some of them are just all over the place. So its a 6 from me.

    Listen. If this had ANYTHING to do with Hercules, I would be fine with it. This is just some strong guy with an evil blue guy after him. FIRST OF ALL: In REAL Greek Mythology, Hades wasn't evil. At all. In fact, he was actually considered to be the honest and protective god of Ancient Greece. This made him into their version of the devil, which he doesn't represent at all. Second: Hera is the villain. Sorry if you missed preschool, elementary school, middle school (if you have that where you live), and High School. And college. And never talked to anyone. But Hera was actually who was after Heracles (the actual spelling of Hercules, they messed that up too.), because he was born with a woman Zeus cheated on her with. In this, she is a loving mother who is afraid for her son. And third: Heracles is not a love story. At all. In fact, he's married already in mythology, but kills her. Yeah, sorry made up lady from the movie, but you never existed anywhere else, and your closest counterpart was killed viciously. Hades never dies, Heracles doesn't have a Pegasus, and Heracles eventually marries a goddess of youth, Hebe, and I think that in the movie it *SPOILERS NOW* ended with him staying on Earth with his girlfriend, but I'm just remembering that. *SPOILERS END* This is the only movie from Disney's prime time that I cannot stand.

    Ever since 1989 when they released The Little Mermaid, the Walt Disney Company had been on a roll with producing high quality animated features again. From such landmark animated features such as Beauty and the Beast to heavily underrated animated films like The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Disney had practically returned to top form. And while Disney's 1997 full-length animated feature Hercules may not bare comparison to the best Disney animated films that came out during that time, it's still an entertaining enough picture in its own unique way. The film starts with the Greek god Zeus (Rip Torn) and his wife Hera celebrating the birth of their son Hercules with the other gods of Olympus, including his evil brother Hades (James Woods). Hades wants to take over Mount Olympus and believes that Hercules will stand in his way. So, he sends his minions Pain and Panic to kidnap baby Hercules and make him drink a potion that will turn him mortal. However, young Hercules still obtains his unusual strength from Mount Olympus and becomes adopted by farmers. As he grows up, he has trouble fitting in with other people due to his strength and wants to finally find out where he came from in the first place. He is able to learn about his real past from Zeus' statue in the Temple of Zeus and also learns that he can reclaim his place on Mount Olympus if he can become a "true hero". Hercules is then sent to find a satyr by the name of Phil (Danny DeVito) who has been known to train some of the finest heroes Greece has ever seen, but has retired due to one letdown too many. But Hercules convinces him otherwise and Phil trains Hercules into a possible hero. When Hercules is older and ready, he and Phil decide to head for the dangerous city of Thebes so that Hercules can perform "heroic deeds" to get the attention of the Gods. On the way, Hercules meets a damsel-in-distress named Meg whom Hercules eventually starts to fall in love with even though he doesn't know that she's secretly Hades' minion. As Hercules starts to become a celebrity of sorts for all the "heroic deeds" he does for the citizens of Thebes, he eventually begins to realize what it really means to be a true hero. I personally thought it was kind of funny how the reason why Hercules was a misfit when he was a teenager was because he was too physically strong. I liked that scene when teenage Hercules accidentally destroys an entire temple (where Greek citizens hang out and apparently "shop" at as well) all for the innocent sake of catching a Frisbee. That scene in a way shows a potential downside to being unusually strong on a physical level. For the record, I'm not saying that exercising isn't important, I'm saying that excessive exercising might not be important. Another aspect about the story of Hercules that I liked was the message it was getting across. That message being that a true hero is someone who doesn't simply defeat many of their evil opponents, but is someone who does something brave that no normal person in their right mind would have the courage to do. In other words, a true hero is a person who does the right thing that no one else will ever do. While Hercules did stand up to enormous creatures that no one else would stand up to, it was, at first, technically more for showing off his strength rather than doing something beneficial for humanity. By far, the most interesting character in this entire picture is the villain Hades. Yes, I realize how clich&eacute;d picking the villain as the best character of a movie can be, but I can't help it. The villains are usually more fascinating characters than most heroes, and the villain in Hercules is no exception. I thought that the animation design of Hades in particular was really cool and the way the color of his flame/hair reflected his emotions (red symbolizing his anger, blue symbolizing that he's calm). But of course, James Woods' voice-over delivery is really what makes this character complete. I admire how Hades doesn't talk like your normal Disney villain would talk, but instead talks similar to a businessman. I don't think the story to Hercules is really that original save for a few little touches, and there are little to no surprises regarding where the plot will go. Just like most other Disney films, you can easily predict how everything will turn out in the end without any problems. I personally could have done without a few side characters particularly some of the sidekicks, like Pain and Panic, which were only created for the sole purpose of killing some screen time. Although I didn't mind the style of the animation or the music in this film, it may not be for everybody. I can understand where people are coming from when they say that they didn't care for the music. I will admit that black gospel music mixed with Greek mythology is an unusual mix to say the least. Personally, I found at least two songs that I liked and at least one song that I didn't care for. Some people say that the animation style is weird, but honestly, I wasn't too bothered by it either since I thought the style was unique. Overall, as far as Disney animated features go, Hercules is okay. It's light and fluffy, but it won't leave much of an impact as something like Beauty and the Beast did. If all that you need is simply an entertaining enough film to show to your kids, then Hercules should do the trick no problem.

    A Disney musical revolving around Greek mythology seems like a great idea. And in Disney's Hercules, the house of mouse makes great use of the famous characters and setting of Greek mythology. There's some hip, gospel songs and plenty of successful humor. So much works in this movie, but it's all sadly counter-balanced by everything that doesn't work. Hercules is born to the god and goddess, Zeus and Hera respectively. And while there is joy at his arrival, Hades wishes to do away with the baby, as his fortune reveals Hercules as a potential threat. Hades sends his two dim-witted minions, Pain and Panic to turn Hercules mortal, and then kill him. Unfortunately for Hades, Pain and Panic slip up when Hercules transformation from god to mortal gets stopped part way through, causing Hercules to retain his supernatural strength, but remain mortal. Hercules longs to be reunited with his parents and the other gods, though he cannot until he becomes a hero, which will then allow him to be turned back into a god. The set up for this story is extremely rushed, and feels almost tacked on. It's like Disney didn't want to spend much time developing the opening, and were more interested in cutting to the action. As a result, there isn't much at the beginning that's of interest, with the exception of one excellent gospel-style song, but I'll get to that later. The characters are mostly uninteresting. Hercules and the romantic interest, Megara (known as Meg) are almost completely personality-less, while Philoctetes (known as Phil), Hercules' trainer, is just a big grump. Only the villain, Hades, is at all interesting, even if he's basically just a hipper version of Jafar or Scar. Focusing less on story, Hercules relies on humor to get by. And while most of the humor is successful and funny, there aren't many big laughs here. Disney's next attempt at a hip comedy (The Emperor's New Groove) is a much more successful and enjoyable film. There's some curious character oversights, and some muddled messages here and there. There are dull stretches, and the action at the end is a bit excessive. Flaws are not hard to find. The songs are of ranging success. The majority of the songs are jazzy gospel tunes, complete with a group of African-American women singing the lyrics. Not only are these songs an innovative and refreshing concept, but the songs are fun and energetic too. It's hard to suppress a smile during these delightful numbers. And yet, there are two songs that don't fit into the gospel theme. They are entitled "Go the Distance" and "Our Last Hope." Both are relatively terrible and instantly forgettable. "Go the Distance" exists only to explain Hercules' desire to go home. This is the kind of song that could've been written in 5 minutes over lunch. "Our Last Hope" has a terrible rhythm and bland lyrics and is ultimately, a mess. It surprises me that a song was not provided for the villain, Hades. Just about every Disney films has had a song for the villain, so why did Hades have to miss out? His slick and sly personality would've been perfect for a nice jazzy beat. The voice cast is a mixed bag. Tate Donovan provides a bland voice for Hercules, and Danny DeVito does the same for Phil. Susan Egan's voice for Meg is much more unique. It's a shame there wasn't an interesting character to go with it. James Wood is wonderful as Hades, providing a perfectly sly and confident voice for the villain. The animation is detailed enough, but the animation style is a bit of a problem. The flat, geometric look just makes the animation appear cheap and lazy.

I felt uninterested in the characters and the story, and for most of the film, I was just waiting for the next toe-tapping gospel tune. The 90's was a great time for Disney, but Hercules may not be the best example of such success.

    This movie is funny and really good but it isn't true Greek Mythology! Firstly the main character's name is HERACLES not HERCULES! Secondly he was a DEMIGOD not a GOD! And HERA wanted tho kill him instead of HADES! And the woman that Heracles liked was called DEIANIRA not MEGANA or MEG! And CHIRON trained him not PHIL! So you get the point. If you want to know about Greek mythology read a series of books called PERCY JACKSON or HEROES OF OLYMPUS. All in all this movie is funny and cute. It does have some real Greek Mythology in it though, but very little. The story teaches you that the strength of your heart is more important than strength itself. Thank you for reading.

    As a guy born in 1993, I grew up when Disney was putting out some classics. I.E. The Lion King, Aladdin, Toy Story, the list goes on and on. But I have to say, when you talk to people about Disney in the '90s, Hercules doesn't usually come up in conversation. I have no idea why. For those who denounce it for it's lack of mythical accuracy, what a bunch of garbage. Do you think Aladdin was historically accurate? Can lions talk? No, so what's the big deal with tweaking Greek Mythology in order to make a children's movie? There shouldn't be one. This movie is such a complete, feel good flick that it motivated me to write a review on here. I'm on this site every day without fail, and I've never felt enthused or irritated enough to post a review. Well I watched this movie again for the first time in years and I just had to. Incredible soundtrack, inspiring story, and great dynamic between the characters. Personally this is my favorite performance of James Woods. In fact, I'm not even a fan of James Woods but he is awesome in this, Hades is almost lovable as the main villain. This movie was as much fun for me at age 19 as it was when I saw it in theaters at age 4, probably even more enjoyable. Watch it despite what you've heard. Show your kids, I know I'm planning on it

    I just had to sign in to write up a review. Overall (Not Average): 8.5/10 Originality/Creativity: 9/10 It's a pretty neat and original story as compared to others of the time (1997). It gave a total twist to the female roles in typical Disney movies. The humour of Meg and Hades was really different too. Music: 8/10 I really love the Muses and the insert singing of Hercules and Meg. The lyrics also really suit the movie instead of taking insert songs, where the lyrics doesn't really "fit in". Of course there are also really good music/songs by other Disney movies too. They got really awesome music most the time, like Little Mermaid. Educational Purposes/Authenticity to Source: 2/10 I basically threw a random low score that makes me "feel" right. Hera isn't Hercules' mother. The "step-mother" was the real mother, at least according to Wikipedia. Hercules isn't a God, just a demi-god, which he stayed true to (in the end, sort of). Hercules had all those adventures, or "trials", which is "sort of" what Hercules in this movie did to become the "true hero". Basically, some facts are somewhat right but not for the right reasons. So it's pretty bad. Cautious Note for "Reviewers": It's really bad to put false information in a kid's movie. It's giving kids false info. But at the same time, it's a kid's movie. It's suppose to be childish, silly, not real and fantasy-like. This should be an element put aside. And to top it off, reviewing a kid's movie should be done by kid's who watched it at the age of 4-10 or whatever.

    Hercules was made in 1997 and Disney kinda lost its marbles a bit with this one and I'm gonna start off with the negative side first just to get it out of the way.......THE SONGS. I swear I do like I Can Go The Distance and I Won't Say I'm In Love,but the rest of the songs were just dreadful and the man who's responsible for this is ALAN MENKEN the same man that brought us Pocahontas,Beauty & The Beast,Enchanted and Tangled(which had a better score BTW). Its kinda confusing because the ending credits song was sung by Micheal Bolton(yeah that husky male singer who sings When A Man Loves A Woman)I mean what is the score suppose to represent Gospel Church Music or Pop music,cause I'm confused. Well alright enough about me bashing the songs what's the movie about well the movie is about a Greek God named Hercules(voiced first by Josh Keaton and later by Tate Donovan)who was sent to Earth by Hades and his sidekicks who are body shifters(they can literally turn themselves into humans or animals)cause Hades wants to rule the kingdom and his got a grudge against Hercules dad(voiced by Rip Thorn). Of course when Hercules grows up and becomes a hero(like Superman or Rocky)he meets a sly sarcastic woman named Meg(voiced by Broadway Singer and Actress Susan Egan)who's also very flirty,but is she for real or is she hiding something from Hercules. Bottom line I did enjoy Hercules for its animation and the charcthers were great(if I had to be honest I found Meg to be my favourite cause she was mysterious and sarcastic yet nice at the same time).One scene did have me laughing and it was when Meg said this I'm a damsel i'm in distress,I can handle this,have a nice day, that was funny. Overall is Hercules the best Disney movie ever NO its not its pretty above average,but do I like it yeah sure its a good flick,despite the fact the songs to its credit are good but some of them are just all over the place. So its a 6 from me.

    Listen. If this had ANYTHING to do with Hercules, I would be fine with it. This is just some strong guy with an evil blue guy after him. FIRST OF ALL: In REAL Greek Mythology, Hades wasn't evil. At all. In fact, he was actually considered to be the honest and protective god of Ancient Greece. This made him into their version of the devil, which he doesn't represent at all. Second: Hera is the villain. Sorry if you missed preschool, elementary school, middle school (if you have that where you live), and High School. And college. And never talked to anyone. But Hera was actually who was after Heracles (the actual spelling of Hercules, they messed that up too.), because he was born with a woman Zeus cheated on her with. In this, she is a loving mother who is afraid for her son. And third: Heracles is not a love story. At all. In fact, he's married already in mythology, but kills her. Yeah, sorry made up lady from the movie, but you never existed anywhere else, and your closest counterpart was killed viciously. Hades never dies, Heracles doesn't have a Pegasus, and Heracles eventually marries a goddess of youth, Hebe, and I think that in the movie it *SPOILERS NOW* ended with him staying on Earth with his girlfriend, but I'm just remembering that. *SPOILERS END* This is the only movie from Disney's prime time that I cannot stand.

    Ever since 1989 when they released The Little Mermaid, the Walt Disney Company had been on a roll with producing high quality animated features again. From such landmark animated features such as Beauty and the Beast to heavily underrated animated films like The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Disney had practically returned to top form. And while Disney's 1997 full-length animated feature Hercules may not bare comparison to the best Disney animated films that came out during that time, it's still an entertaining enough picture in its own unique way. The film starts with the Greek god Zeus (Rip Torn) and his wife Hera celebrating the birth of their son Hercules with the other gods of Olympus, including his evil brother Hades (James Woods). Hades wants to take over Mount Olympus and believes that Hercules will stand in his way. So, he sends his minions Pain and Panic to kidnap baby Hercules and make him drink a potion that will turn him mortal. However, young Hercules still obtains his unusual strength from Mount Olympus and becomes adopted by farmers. As he grows up, he has trouble fitting in with other people due to his strength and wants to finally find out where he came from in the first place. He is able to learn about his real past from Zeus' statue in the Temple of Zeus and also learns that he can reclaim his place on Mount Olympus if he can become a "true hero". Hercules is then sent to find a satyr by the name of Phil (Danny DeVito) who has been known to train some of the finest heroes Greece has ever seen, but has retired due to one letdown too many. But Hercules convinces him otherwise and Phil trains Hercules into a possible hero. When Hercules is older and ready, he and Phil decide to head for the dangerous city of Thebes so that Hercules can perform "heroic deeds" to get the attention of the Gods. On the way, Hercules meets a damsel-in-distress named Meg whom Hercules eventually starts to fall in love with even though he doesn't know that she's secretly Hades' minion. As Hercules starts to become a celebrity of sorts for all the "heroic deeds" he does for the citizens of Thebes, he eventually begins to realize what it really means to be a true hero. I personally thought it was kind of funny how the reason why Hercules was a misfit when he was a teenager was because he was too physically strong. I liked that scene when teenage Hercules accidentally destroys an entire temple (where Greek citizens hang out and apparently "shop" at as well) all for the innocent sake of catching a Frisbee. That scene in a way shows a potential downside to being unusually strong on a physical level. For the record, I'm not saying that exercising isn't important, I'm saying that excessive exercising might not be important. Another aspect about the story of Hercules that I liked was the message it was getting across. That message being that a true hero is someone who doesn't simply defeat many of their evil opponents, but is someone who does something brave that no normal person in their right mind would have the courage to do. In other words, a true hero is a person who does the right thing that no one else will ever do. While Hercules did stand up to enormous creatures that no one else would stand up to, it was, at first, technically more for showing off his strength rather than doing something beneficial for humanity. By far, the most interesting character in this entire picture is the villain Hades. Yes, I realize how clich&eacute;d picking the villain as the best character of a movie can be, but I can't help it. The villains are usually more fascinating characters than most heroes, and the villain in Hercules is no exception. I thought that the animation design of Hades in particular was really cool and the way the color of his flame/hair reflected his emotions (red symbolizing his anger, blue symbolizing that he's calm). But of course, James Woods' voice-over delivery is really what makes this character complete. I admire how Hades doesn't talk like your normal Disney villain would talk, but instead talks similar to a businessman. I don't think the story to Hercules is really that original save for a few little touches, and there are little to no surprises regarding where the plot will go. Just like most other Disney films, you can easily predict how everything will turn out in the end without any problems. I personally could have done without a few side characters particularly some of the sidekicks, like Pain and Panic, which were only created for the sole purpose of killing some screen time. Although I didn't mind the style of the animation or the music in this film, it may not be for everybody. I can understand where people are coming from when they say that they didn't care for the music. I will admit that black gospel music mixed with Greek mythology is an unusual mix to say the least. Personally, I found at least two songs that I liked and at least one song that I didn't care for. Some people say that the animation style is weird, but honestly, I wasn't too bothered by it either since I thought the style was unique. Overall, as far as Disney animated features go, Hercules is okay. It's light and fluffy, but it won't leave much of an impact as something like Beauty and the Beast did. If all that you need is simply an entertaining enough film to show to your kids, then Hercules should do the trick no problem.

    A Disney musical revolving around Greek mythology seems like a great idea. And in Disney's Hercules, the house of mouse makes great use of the famous characters and setting of Greek mythology. There's some hip, gospel songs and plenty of successful humor. So much works in this movie, but it's all sadly counter-balanced by everything that doesn't work. Hercules is born to the god and goddess, Zeus and Hera respectively. And while there is joy at his arrival, Hades wishes to do away with the baby, as his fortune reveals Hercules as a potential threat. Hades sends his two dim-witted minions, Pain and Panic to turn Hercules mortal, and then kill him. Unfortunately for Hades, Pain and Panic slip up when Hercules transformation from god to mortal gets stopped part way through, causing Hercules to retain his supernatural strength, but remain mortal. Hercules longs to be reunited with his parents and the other gods, though he cannot until he becomes a hero, which will then allow him to be turned back into a god. The set up for this story is extremely rushed, and feels almost tacked on. It's like Disney didn't want to spend much time developing the opening, and were more interested in cutting to the action. As a result, there isn't much at the beginning that's of interest, with the exception of one excellent gospel-style song, but I'll get to that later. The characters are mostly uninteresting. Hercules and the romantic interest, Megara (known as Meg) are almost completely personality-less, while Philoctetes (known as Phil), Hercules' trainer, is just a big grump. Only the villain, Hades, is at all interesting, even if he's basically just a hipper version of Jafar or Scar. Focusing less on story, Hercules relies on humor to get by. And while most of the humor is successful and funny, there aren't many big laughs here. Disney's next attempt at a hip comedy (The Emperor's New Groove) is a much more successful and enjoyable film. There's some curious character oversights, and some muddled messages here and there. There are dull stretches, and the action at the end is a bit excessive. Flaws are not hard to find. The songs are of ranging success. The majority of the songs are jazzy gospel tunes, complete with a group of African-American women singing the lyrics. Not only are these songs an innovative and refreshing concept, but the songs are fun and energetic too. It's hard to suppress a smile during these delightful numbers. And yet, there are two songs that don't fit into the gospel theme. They are entitled "Go the Distance" and "Our Last Hope." Both are relatively terrible and instantly forgettable. "Go the Distance" exists only to explain Hercules' desire to go home. This is the kind of song that could've been written in 5 minutes over lunch. "Our Last Hope" has a terrible rhythm and bland lyrics and is ultimately, a mess. It surprises me that a song was not provided for the villain, Hades. Just about every Disney films has had a song for the villain, so why did Hades have to miss out? His slick and sly personality would've been perfect for a nice jazzy beat. The voice cast is a mixed bag. Tate Donovan provides a bland voice for Hercules, and Danny DeVito does the same for Phil. Susan Egan's voice for Meg is much more unique. It's a shame there wasn't an interesting character to go with it. James Wood is wonderful as Hades, providing a perfectly sly and confident voice for the villain. The animation is detailed enough, but the animation style is a bit of a problem. The flat, geometric look just makes the animation appear cheap and lazy. CGI is occasionally integrated into the animation, and it looks great. Alan Menken's score is superb, if a little shy of his work in other Disney films of the time. Grand melodies and exciting action music make this score a success, even though it sounds a bit familiar to Menken's score for Aladdin. Sometimes funny, but riddled with flaws, Hercules is a disappointing Disney feature. As much as I wanted to like Hercules, there's just so much that doesn't work here. I felt uninterested in the characters and the story, and for most of the film, I was just waiting for the next toe-tapping gospel tune. The 90's was a great time for Disney, but Hercules may not be the best example of such success.

    I absolutely adore this movie, and I believe it is one of the most underrated Disney movies, especially of the renaissance. It's full of the ingredients to make a perfect Disney movie: Comedy (thank you, James Woods/The Muses), a brilliant role model for young girls (Megara), and catchy songs, which you know already. It sucks that this movie doesn't get the recognition it deserves. Although I think that almost everything that comes out of the Disney studios is pure wonderful (with the exception of Cars....yikes), this is definitely a stand out in what they did. I'd even go as far as to say that this movie trumps one of Disney's classics of the 90's - Aladdin. Maybe it just wasn't marketed properly, but I believe this should be up there with the greats. In short, I love this movie, as I've mentioned 500 times already. My 3rd favourite in my list of Disney movies, and very hard to shove from that position. And who put the glad in gladiator?

    I am a person who really enjoys Disney films, despite my age. (I'm 20.) Some people say that Hercules was the film that killed people's interest in animated Disney films after Pocahontas and The Hunchback of Notre Dame came out. I personally believe that it was a decent film. However, I think it could've turned out to be one of their best movies. It had the story to do it, and it also had a very funny, plus popular villain in Hades. It just turned out to be very problematic. First off, I think the way the story is told is very odd. You have 5 women, who are known as "The Muses". They basically tell the beginning of the film in song, introduce us to Hades, and you see them appear during the movie. You see them have a song when Hercules is becoming popular, when Hercules' love interest, Meg, is trying to decide whether she's in love or not, and at the end of the film after Hercules stopped Hades. They act very surprised each time they appear. "Oh my god, Hercules is becoming popular! Oh wow, he stopped Hades!" I think if the Muses weren't telling the story, and it was told without continuing narration, this film would be considered a classic. I also have a problem with the transitions. At one point, the film is trying to be a comedy, and the other, it's dramatic. You can put them into a film, but you need it to transition well. It does not in this film. I think they were trying to be like Aladdin, but the transitions between comedy and drama worked in that film. It does not here. This film is also like ancient Greece meets modern day Las Vegas. I mainly say that in the "Zero to Hero" song. You see all those flashing lights and lighting changes, and you see some modern-like products placed like "Herculade" and "Air-Herc". If I'm watching something that took place a very long time ago, I don't wanna see something similar to Gatorade. Sure, Aladdin had that too in the "Friend Like Me" song, but it makes sense because he has a magic genie. Here, it doesn't. But the reason I think it's decent is because, like I said, it does have a great story to tell. It's just told very weirdly. I also like the comedy in it. The scene where Pain and Panic are getting a lot of Hercules merchandise is really funny. Overall, this could've been a movie good enough to be considered one of Disney's best. It just had too many problems.

    So i picked this one up for 50% off at one of the local big box stores. My 4 year old daughter is in a real Disney phase right now, just devouring everything. We were at the point where we were picking up the more obscure Disney flicks from the 90's, like HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME and TARZAN (which we have found for dirt cheap!) I remembered seeing this back when it first came out in 97, and remember feeling like it was more of a boy movie, but for the price i figured "eh, if she even watches it once we got our money's worth out of it." My daughter had worn the DVDs for "SLEEPING BEAUTY" and "BEAUTY AND THE BEAST" right out, but neither of them compare to how much she loves "HERCULES"! Ever since i bought the movie a week ago she has watched the movie 2 times a day, each day, since then. It has trumped her love of every other Disney movie! I know a lot of people feel like Meg is a side character who doesn't really connect with most young girls, but my daughter looks at her as the absolute best Disney Princess of them all. I also have to say that "I won't say I'm in Love" has gotta be near the top of the list of the most under-appreciated, underrated Disney songs. My daughter keeps asking for me to replay that song over and over and over, and she dances up a storm to it. If you're thinking this movie might not appeal to the young Disney Princess in your life, think again. Really a gem for what you pay for it, right now!

In this, she is a loving mother who is afraid for her son. And third: Heracles is not a love story. At all. In fact, he's married already in mythology, but kills her. Yeah, sorry made up lady from the movie, but you never existed anywhere else, and your closest counterpart was killed viciously. Hades never dies, Heracles doesn't have a Pegasus, and Heracles eventually marries a goddess of youth, Hebe, and I think that in the movie it *SPOILERS NOW* ended with him staying on Earth with his girlfriend, but I'm just remembering that. *SPOILERS END* This is the only movie from Disney's prime time that I cannot stand.

    Ever since 1989 when they released The Little Mermaid, the Walt Disney Company had been on a roll with producing high quality animated features again. From such landmark animated features such as Beauty and the Beast to heavily underrated animated films like The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Disney had practically returned to top form. And while Disney's 1997 full-length animated feature Hercules may not bare comparison to the best Disney animated films that came out during that time, it's still an entertaining enough picture in its own unique way. The film starts with the Greek god Zeus (Rip Torn) and his wife Hera celebrating the birth of their son Hercules with the other gods of Olympus, including his evil brother Hades (James Woods). Hades wants to take over Mount Olympus and believes that Hercules will stand in his way. So, he sends his minions Pain and Panic to kidnap baby Hercules and make him drink a potion that will turn him mortal. However, young Hercules still obtains his unusual strength from Mount Olympus and becomes adopted by farmers. As he grows up, he has trouble fitting in with other people due to his strength and wants to finally find out where he came from in the first place. He is able to learn about his real past from Zeus' statue in the Temple of Zeus and also learns that he can reclaim his place on Mount Olympus if he can become a "true hero". Hercules is then sent to find a satyr by the name of Phil (Danny DeVito) who has been known to train some of the finest heroes Greece has ever seen, but has retired due to one letdown too many. But Hercules convinces him otherwise and Phil trains Hercules into a possible hero. When Hercules is older and ready, he and Phil decide to head for the dangerous city of Thebes so that Hercules can perform "heroic deeds" to get the attention of the Gods. On the way, Hercules meets a damsel-in-distress named Meg whom Hercules eventually starts to fall in love with even though he doesn't know that she's secretly Hades' minion. As Hercules starts to become a celebrity of sorts for all the "heroic deeds" he does for the citizens of Thebes, he eventually begins to realize what it really means to be a true hero. I personally thought it was kind of funny how the reason why Hercules was a misfit when he was a teenager was because he was too physically strong. I liked that scene when teenage Hercules accidentally destroys an entire temple (where Greek citizens hang out and apparently "shop" at as well) all for the innocent sake of catching a Frisbee. That scene in a way shows a potential downside to being unusually strong on a physical level. For the record, I'm not saying that exercising isn't important, I'm saying that excessive exercising might not be important. Another aspect about the story of Hercules that I liked was the message it was getting across. That message being that a true hero is someone who doesn't simply defeat many of their evil opponents, but is someone who does something brave that no normal person in their right mind would have the courage to do. In other words, a true hero is a person who does the right thing that no one else will ever do. While Hercules did stand up to enormous creatures that no one else would stand up to, it was, at first, technically more for showing off his strength rather than doing something beneficial for humanity. By far, the most interesting character in this entire picture is the villain Hades. Yes, I realize how clich&eacute;d picking the villain as the best character of a movie can be, but I can't help it. The villains are usually more fascinating characters than most heroes, and the villain in Hercules is no exception. I thought that the animation design of Hades in particular was really cool and the way the color of his flame/hair reflected his emotions (red symbolizing his anger, blue symbolizing that he's calm). But of course, James Woods' voice-over delivery is really what makes this character complete. I admire how Hades doesn't talk like your normal Disney villain would talk, but instead talks similar to a businessman. I don't think the story to Hercules is really that original save for a few little touches, and there are little to no surprises regarding where the plot will go. Just like most other Disney films, you can easily predict how everything will turn out in the end without any problems. I personally could have done without a few side characters particularly some of the sidekicks, like Pain and Panic, which were only created for the sole purpose of killing some screen time. Although I didn't mind the style of the animation or the music in this film, it may not be for everybody. I can understand where people are coming from when they say that they didn't care for the music. I will admit that black gospel music mixed with Greek mythology is an unusual mix to say the least. Personally, I found at least two songs that I liked and at least one song that I didn't care for. Some people say that the animation style is weird, but honestly, I wasn't too bothered by it either since I thought the style was unique. Overall, as far as Disney animated features go, Hercules is okay. It's light and fluffy, but it won't leave much of an impact as something like Beauty and the Beast did. If all that you need is simply an entertaining enough film to show to your kids, then Hercules should do the trick no problem.

    A Disney musical revolving around Greek mythology seems like a great idea. And in Disney's Hercules, the house of mouse makes great use of the famous characters and setting of Greek mythology. There's some hip, gospel songs and plenty of successful humor. So much works in this movie, but it's all sadly counter-balanced by everything that doesn't work. Hercules is born to the god and goddess, Zeus and Hera respectively. And while there is joy at his arrival, Hades wishes to do away with the baby, as his fortune reveals Hercules as a potential threat. Hades sends his two dim-witted minions, Pain and Panic to turn Hercules mortal, and then kill him. Unfortunately for Hades, Pain and Panic slip up when Hercules transformation from god to mortal gets stopped part way through, causing Hercules to retain his supernatural strength, but remain mortal. Hercules longs to be reunited with his parents and the other gods, though he cannot until he becomes a hero, which will then allow him to be turned back into a god. The set up for this story is extremely rushed, and feels almost tacked on. It's like Disney didn't want to spend much time developing the opening, and were more interested in cutting to the action. As a result, there isn't much at the beginning that's of interest, with the exception of one excellent gospel-style song, but I'll get to that later. The characters are mostly uninteresting. Hercules and the romantic interest, Megara (known as Meg) are almost completely personality-less, while Philoctetes (known as Phil), Hercules' trainer, is just a big grump. Only the villain, Hades, is at all interesting, even if he's basically just a hipper version of Jafar or Scar. Focusing less on story, Hercules relies on humor to get by. And while most of the humor is successful and funny, there aren't many big laughs here. Disney's next attempt at a hip comedy (The Emperor's New Groove) is a much more successful and enjoyable film. There's some curious character oversights, and some muddled messages here and there. There are dull stretches, and the action at the end is a bit excessive. Flaws are not hard to find. The songs are of ranging success. The majority of the songs are jazzy gospel tunes, complete with a group of African-American women singing the lyrics. Not only are these songs an innovative and refreshing concept, but the songs are fun and energetic too. It's hard to suppress a smile during these delightful numbers. And yet, there are two songs that don't fit into the gospel theme. They are entitled "Go the Distance" and "Our Last Hope." Both are relatively terrible and instantly forgettable. "Go the Distance" exists only to explain Hercules' desire to go home. This is the kind of song that could've been written in 5 minutes over lunch. "Our Last Hope" has a terrible rhythm and bland lyrics and is ultimately, a mess. It surprises me that a song was not provided for the villain, Hades. Just about every Disney films has had a song for the villain, so why did Hades have to miss out? His slick and sly personality would've been perfect for a nice jazzy beat. The voice cast is a mixed bag. Tate Donovan provides a bland voice for Hercules, and Danny DeVito does the same for Phil. Susan Egan's voice for Meg is much more unique. It's a shame there wasn't an interesting character to go with it. James Wood is wonderful as Hades, providing a perfectly sly and confident voice for the villain. The animation is detailed enough, but the animation style is a bit of a problem. The flat, geometric look just makes the animation appear cheap and lazy. CGI is occasionally integrated into the animation, and it looks great. Alan Menken's score is superb, if a little shy of his work in other Disney films of the time. Grand melodies and exciting action music make this score a success, even though it sounds a bit familiar to Menken's score for Aladdin. Sometimes funny, but riddled with flaws, Hercules is a disappointing Disney feature. As much as I wanted to like Hercules, there's just so much that doesn't work here. I felt uninterested in the characters and the story, and for most of the film, I was just waiting for the next toe-tapping gospel tune. The 90's was a great time for Disney, but Hercules may not be the best example of such success.

    I absolutely adore this movie, and I believe it is one of the most underrated Disney movies, especially of the renaissance. It's full of the ingredients to make a perfect Disney movie: Comedy (thank you, James Woods/The Muses), a brilliant role model for young girls (Megara), and catchy songs, which you know already. It sucks that this movie doesn't get the recognition it deserves. Although I think that almost everything that comes out of the Disney studios is pure wonderful (with the exception of Cars....yikes), this is definitely a stand out in what they did. I'd even go as far as to say that this movie trumps one of Disney's classics of the 90's - Aladdin. Maybe it just wasn't marketed properly, but I believe this should be up there with the greats. In short, I love this movie, as I've mentioned 500 times already. My 3rd favourite in my list of Disney movies, and very hard to shove from that position. And who put the glad in gladiator?

    I am a person who really enjoys Disney films, despite my age. (I'm 20.) Some people say that Hercules was the film that killed people's interest in animated Disney films after Pocahontas and The Hunchback of Notre Dame came out. I personally believe that it was a decent film. However, I think it could've turned out to be one of their best movies. It had the story to do it, and it also had a very funny, plus popular villain in Hades. It just turned out to be very problematic. First off, I think the way the story is told is very odd. You have 5 women, who are known as "The Muses". They basically tell the beginning of the film in song, introduce us to Hades, and you see them appear during the movie. You see them have a song when Hercules is becoming popular, when Hercules' love interest, Meg, is trying to decide whether she's in love or not, and at the end of the film after Hercules stopped Hades. They act very surprised each time they appear. "Oh my god, Hercules is becoming popular! Oh wow, he stopped Hades!" I think if the Muses weren't telling the story, and it was told without continuing narration, this film would be considered a classic. I also have a problem with the transitions. At one point, the film is trying to be a comedy, and the other, it's dramatic. You can put them into a film, but you need it to transition well. It does not in this film. I think they were trying to be like Aladdin, but the transitions between comedy and drama worked in that film. It does not here. This film is also like ancient Greece meets modern day Las Vegas. I mainly say that in the "Zero to Hero" song. You see all those flashing lights and lighting changes, and you see some modern-like products placed like "Herculade" and "Air-Herc". If I'm watching something that took place a very long time ago, I don't wanna see something similar to Gatorade. Sure, Aladdin had that too in the "Friend Like Me" song, but it makes sense because he has a magic genie. Here, it doesn't. But the reason I think it's decent is because, like I said, it does have a great story to tell. It's just told very weirdly. I also like the comedy in it. The scene where Pain and Panic are getting a lot of Hercules merchandise is really funny. Overall, this could've been a movie good enough to be considered one of Disney's best. It just had too many problems.

    So i picked this one up for 50% off at one of the local big box stores. My 4 year old daughter is in a real Disney phase right now, just devouring everything. We were at the point where we were picking up the more obscure Disney flicks from the 90's, like HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME and TARZAN (which we have found for dirt cheap!) I remembered seeing this back when it first came out in 97, and remember feeling like it was more of a boy movie, but for the price i figured "eh, if she even watches it once we got our money's worth out of it." My daughter had worn the DVDs for "SLEEPING BEAUTY" and "BEAUTY AND THE BEAST" right out, but neither of them compare to how much she loves "HERCULES"! Ever since i bought the movie a week ago she has watched the movie 2 times a day, each day, since then. It has trumped her love of every other Disney movie! I know a lot of people feel like Meg is a side character who doesn't really connect with most young girls, but my daughter looks at her as the absolute best Disney Princess of them all. I also have to say that "I won't say I'm in Love" has gotta be near the top of the list of the most under-appreciated, underrated Disney songs. My daughter keeps asking for me to replay that song over and over and over, and she dances up a storm to it. If you're thinking this movie might not appeal to the young Disney Princess in your life, think again. Really a gem for what you pay for it, right now!

    This movie is funny and really good but it isn't true Greek Mythology! Firstly the main character's name is HERACLES not HERCULES! Secondly he was a DEMIGOD not a GOD! And HERA wanted tho kill him instead of HADES! And the woman that Heracles liked was called DEIANIRA not MEGANA or MEG! And CHIRON trained him not PHIL! So you get the point. If you want to know about Greek mythology read a series of books called PERCY JACKSON or HEROES OF OLYMPUS. All in all this movie is funny and cute. It does have some real Greek Mythology in it though, but very little. The story teaches you that the strength of your heart is more important than strength itself. Thank you for reading.

    As a guy born in 1993, I grew up when Disney was putting out some classics. I.E. The Lion King, Aladdin, Toy Story, the list goes on and on. But I have to say, when you talk to people about Disney in the '90s, Hercules doesn't usually come up in conversation. I have no idea why. For those who denounce it for it's lack of mythical accuracy, what a bunch of garbage. Do you think Aladdin was historically accurate? Can lions talk? No, so what's the big deal with tweaking Greek Mythology in order to make a children's movie? There shouldn't be one. This movie is such a complete, feel good flick that it motivated me to write a review on here. I'm on this site every day without fail, and I've never felt enthused or irritated enough to post a review. Well I watched this movie again for the first time in years and I just had to. Incredible soundtrack, inspiring story, and great dynamic between the characters. Personally this is my favorite performance of James Woods. In fact, I'm not even a fan of James Woods but he is awesome in this, Hades is almost lovable as the main villain. This movie was as much fun for me at age 19 as it was when I saw it in theaters at age 4, probably even more enjoyable. Watch it despite what you've heard. Show your kids, I know I'm planning on it

    I just had to sign in to write up a review. Overall (Not Average): 8.5/10 Originality/Creativity: 9/10 It's a pretty neat and original story as compared to others of the time (1997). It gave a total twist to the female roles in typical Disney movies. The humour of Meg and Hades was really different too. Music: 8/10 I really love the Muses and the insert singing of Hercules and Meg. The lyrics also really suit the movie instead of taking insert songs, where the lyrics doesn't really "fit in". Of course there are also really good music/songs by other Disney movies too. They got really awesome music most the time, like Little Mermaid. Educational Purposes/Authenticity to Source: 2/10 I basically threw a random low score that makes me "feel" right. Hera isn't Hercules' mother. The "step-mother" was the real mother, at least according to Wikipedia. Hercules isn't a God, just a demi-god, which he stayed true to (in the end, sort of). Hercules had all those adventures, or "trials", which is "sort of" what Hercules in this movie did to become the "true hero". Basically, some facts are somewhat right but not for the right reasons. So it's pretty bad. Cautious Note for "Reviewers": It's really bad to put false information in a kid's movie. It's giving kids false info. But at the same time, it's a kid's movie. It's suppose to be childish, silly, not real and fantasy-like. This should be an element put aside. And to top it off, reviewing a kid's movie should be done by kid's who watched it at the age of 4-10 or whatever.
