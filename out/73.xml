 <sinopse>
  Bret Maverick, needing money for a poker tournament, faces various comic mishaps and challenges, including a charming woman thief.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Maverick is recreated from the character James Garner created in the 1950s TV program. Maverick is a gambler who would rather con someone than fight them. He needs an additional three thousand dollars in order to enter a Winner Take All poker game that begins in a few days. He tries to win some, tries to collect a few debts, and recover a little loot for the reward, all with a light hearted air. He joins forces with a woman gambler with a marvelous, though fake, southern accent as the two both try and enter the game.

    Love this film. It's silly, funny, irreverent and clever, and does not take itself seriously at all. Mel Gibson is at his most charming and irrepressible, and Jodie Foster dazzles as con-merchant and petite-criminal Annabelle Bransford, Bret Maverick's "nemesis" in the story. The plot is simply that Bret has to secure $25,000 to enter a poker tournament and he has some trouble raising the money given Annabelle trying to rip him off and Marshal Zane Cooper (James Garner - the original TV Maverick) doing his best to stop him getting to his destination. Bret is a fast-thinking, fast-talking trickster who's friendship with local Native American Indian Joseph (the brilliant Graham Greene) gets the trio out of a tight spot and also makes for the funniest scenes of the film. Some great stunts, amazing one-liners and a shocking disregard to the amounts of money they have pass through their hands (given it's set in the 1800s) make this an enjoyable, charming and pleasing film. Amusing cameo from Danny Glover (Lethal Weapon)

    This is a family favorite that I watched again with my girls. Mel Gibson was at his best during the 90s and is thoroughly enjoyable in this tongue-in-cheek, nothing-is-what-it-seems adventure. Jodie Foster as the pseudo Southern belle and James Garner reprising his TV role complement Gibson perfectly. The movie is presented in three acts. Act 1 sets up Gibson as the playful conman trying to earn just a bit more money to enter the "poker match of the century." Act 2 introduces Garner as Gibson's apparent foil trying both to earn the respect of Mrs. Bransford and, we gather, to keep an eye on Maverick. Act 3 is the poker match where everyone shows their true colors. Tons of fun and a great diversion. Eight of ten stars for the pure entertainment value.

    As TV show adaptations go, "Maverick" is a movie that excels because of a rollicking sense of fun and good humor. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and I think everyone involved is perfectly chosen for the job. The film opens with Mel Gibson's eponymous gambler, out to prove he's the best poker player. He's $3,000 short of the $25,000 buy-in, and his quest finds him in an unlikely partnership with like-minded gamblers Annabelle Bransford (Jodie Foster) and Marshall Zane Cooper (James Garner). And it's a journey that will see our hero tangle with rattlesnakes, renegade Indians and even a runaway stagecoach. "Maverick" is an Action/Adventure/Western/Comedy that runs high on likability and even a few great setpieces. Everyone involved is clearly having fun, and it goes a long way in inviting the audience in on the laugh. It's the kind of TV show adaptation that doesn't require the viewer to have seen the original show. There's enough here in the engaging protagonist to keep the audience interested in the free- standing story. And what an affable hero Maverick is, a role that greatly benefits from Mel Gibson's trademark boyish charm and joking sense of humor. It's not just Gibson; Foster and Garner also show an unexpected flair for comedy. Maybe the real star of "Maverick" is William Goldman's terrific screenplay; one that infuses the movie with a delightfully wry sense of humor and lightheartedness. In almost every scene, things aren't always as they seem; and it's usually played to great comedic effect. This is the movie that made me a Goldman fan (in my defense, I haven't yet seen his greatest hits, so to speak). I found myself constantly grinning from ear to ear. You don't even have to be a Western fan to appreciate "Maverick". It's just an overall likable movie. 8/10

    Maybe it wasn't really like this in the Old West but this film does fill me with the hope that at least sometimes it had these moments. This film is pure entertainment, not a historical documentary and certainly not, at any point, to be taken seriously. Maverick's (Mel Gibson's) character as a likable rogue had a surreal and very believable chemistry with Annabelle Bransford (Jodie Foster) and a pleasant nod to the "original" maverick that old standby, James Garner. The humour is firmly tongue-in-cheek and Foster does indeed "do southern" very acceptably and looks as radiant as any woman in the role could. Her unique brand of energy, injured innocence, scheming minxicity (I made that up) and twangy edginess give the part a solid and definitive profile. No man of Maverick's marque (or any other for that matter) could resist chasing a temptress of such charm, beauty and duplicity through a hundred countries to get his money back and would indeed have a wonderful time doing it. I'm not a Mel Gibson fan but this exceptional part was cast against type and Mel performed very well. As I said, the chemistry between Mel and Jodie is tangible, perhaps because they're close friends off-screen as well. Garner is solid, if a little pedestrian (don't mistake it for gravitas Mr. G), but since he's already got his (metaphorical) halo it's hard to find fault with him and particularly for his acceptably human (if feigned) reluctance to join a firefight with a bunch of drunken outlaws. Joseph (Graham Greene) is outstanding as is Angel (fellow countryman Alfred Molina who has proved himself many times since) as the kind of necessary semi-villain/rogue types that help show Maverick, no angel himself, in a slightly less predatory light. This film pretends to be nothing but what it is and that stands to its eternal credit. There's no doubt, given the cast performances, that this film was a hoot to make. Such films are vital to lighten our moods from the sombre turns they can take sometimes by reminding us that probably it was much worse in the past, and for exactly that reason, it might also have been quite a bit better.

    first things first - i am a big fan of mel Gibson and jodie foster, westerns and comedy. hence, its no surprise that i rather enjoyed the slickly made maverick. mel Gibson and jodie foster are simply brilliant and great fun to watch. the plot is pathetic and an excuse for a series of fun-filled capers and smart lines. the movie is filled with witticisms that are really cool, my favorite being danny glovers cameo and his line "im getting too old for this s**t". :) jodie foster looks absolutely adorable, mel Gibson is his usual dashing self. the downsides are the way too many plot twists towards the end, throwing one off the track and frankly they were rather unnecessary, quite annoying indeed. but in all its a fun movie for a relaxed evening, nothing great - just a lil bit of fun. a fun-filled 7!

    Let me say at the outset that Maverick is a hugely enjoyable humorous western. Coming right in the thick of Hollywood mining TV nostalgia in order to put big screen adaptations of popular TV series from yesteryear on screen, it is both a decent homage to its progenitor as well as being a very entertaining movie in its own right. It has a good, unpredictable story, an excellent cast who all perform well (especially the supporting characters), Mel Gibson makes an attractive Bret Maverick, and it is pleasing to see James Garner, TV's Bret Maverick, as Marshal Zane Cooper - such films like to place members of the original cast as a nod of approval, a way of linking the old to the new. And then the makers of this film play a trick on the audience (by which I mean those members who recall the original and are watching this film for the first time). I can't say anything about it other than that it involves confounding expectations, but it is a sheer delight when it dawns on the audience how thoroughly they have been had. I'm not a major Mel Gibson fan, but I do like this movie a lot.

    Plot: A card player in the Old West tries to win a cards tournament worth $250,000 but finds that someone is out to stop him. MAVERICK is a big screen adaptation of the old TV show about a gifted card player (and crook) in the Wild West. After learning about the tournament Maverick has to raise the $25,000 entrance fee, which is what he spends most of the movie doing. He finds himself chased by villains, hunted as human prey by a mad Russian noble and alternately assisted and hindered by a female grifter and a leathery old lawman. He also meets a bunch of post-modern Indians but the jokes are pretty thin and it only serves to pad the movie out far beyond what it ought to have been. The leads are good, the script fun and the direction competent yet the film never quite suckers you in. There are enough fights (OK), plot twists (a goodie at the end) and jokes to keep you going but it doesn't lift off and a good half-hour ought to have been left on the cutting room floor.

    'Maverick', directed by the legendary Richard Donner, is a genuinely entertaining film, that also manages some good laughs in the goings-on. The film is stylishly directed, wonderfully photographed & features a Fabulous performance by cult actor, Mel Gibson. Set in the American Old West, Gibson stars as Bret Maverick, a wisecracking gambler, on the way to a major five-card draw poker tournament. But on his way to reach his destination, he is faced by a women thief, a villain who wants to track him down & a legendary lawman. Based on the 1950s television series of the same name, created by Roy Huggins, 'Maverick' turns out to be Good Fun. The Screenplay is well-written and packs in several interesting moments. The Witty One-Liners, are hilarious and keep your interest alive. Donner's direction, like always, is effective. He has directed the Grand Climax, with style. Cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond, is wonderful. Editing is sharp. Costume Design is pitch-perfect. Performance-Wise: Gibson, as mentioned, delivers a Fabulous performance as Maverick. He gets his comic timing spot-on and plays his part with rare ease. Jodie Foster is efficient, as expected. James Garner is top-notch. Alfred Molina & Graham Greene are decent. James Coburn is terrific in a brief, yet substantial role. On the whole, 'Maverick' is an entertaining film, that is definitely worth a watch. Thumbs Up!

    Maverick is directed by Richard Donner and written by William Goldman. It stars Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster and James Garner, with support coming from Alfred Molina, Graham Greene and James Coburn. The music is scored by Randy Newman and Vilmos Zsigmond is on photography. It's based on the 1950s television series of the same name and the plot finds Gibson as Maverick and follows his attempt to take his place in a major five-card draw poker tournament. With Foster and Garner in tow, there's plenty of adventures and misadventures along the way. After Costner's Dances With Wolves and Eastwood's Unforgiven had reignited interest in the Western genre in the 90s, Richard Donner and his team felt the time was right to unleash a light hearted Western on the mainstream audience. Timing was important, as was the casting, but Maverick is the sort of family friendly fun that could in truth be released at any time in any decade and still be a hit at the box office. It's not particularly clever in narrative or themes, but with its blending of action, romance and comedy seamlessly coming together as a whole, Maverick is practically hard to dislike. Even the cast seem to be having a real good time, with Gibson smooth and roguish, Foster dainty yet spunky and Garner (the original Maverick from the TV show) offering up a sort of stoic maturity over proceedings; with all three playing the comedy with ease (how great it is to see Foster in such a role). Donner and Goldman have also shown respect to both the TV show and the Western in general (check out those lovely landscapes), while it's always fun to play spot the numerous stars in the cameos. Harmless fluff, then, but always watchable and never once over reaching itself by trying to be something it's not. 7.5/10

    A worthy little film on the far west the way we can see it today, a big farce. Everything is false. A woman is playing poker and picking pockets. A Marshall is robbing the bank of a poker competition, with the agreement of the organizer. All kinds of players who are cheating and trying to win with weapons or violence, or even unfair padlocks. Indians who are organizing wagon train attacks for some dollars and the killing of some fake Indians still for a lot of money from a Russian ambassador. In one word everything is false, a big lie and a big laugh between or among the gun fire and the bullets. And yet all those crooks are trying to steal one another and the only woman in the tale will get the last word, except that she will only get a small part of the stake. Never put all your eggs in one basket. The only real interest of this film is not to show you what the far west used to be but to make you enjoy a comedy about it and that comedy is of course absurd. And that's why it is funny with some good actors who can play surprise and fear and joy and pleasure (you see the one I mean) and horror just as if the rattle snake under their feet were a real rattle snake. It sounds like one all right but it is nothing but a fake plastic rattling device and it won't bite. Even though they had a rattle snake tamer on the team, or rather because. I guess he is the one who dubbed them for the rattling to sound really real. Speaking of Canada Dry. Well we are in the country of the saints, Saint Louis and so many others down to New Orleans.

It's based on the 1950s television series of the same name and the plot finds Gibson as Maverick and follows his attempt to take his place in a major five-card draw poker tournament. With Foster and Garner in tow, there's plenty of adventures and misadventures along the way. After Costner's Dances With Wolves and Eastwood's Unforgiven had reignited interest in the Western genre in the 90s, Richard Donner and his team felt the time was right to unleash a light hearted Western on the mainstream audience. Timing was important, as was the casting, but Maverick is the sort of family friendly fun that could in truth be released at any time in any decade and still be a hit at the box office. It's not particularly clever in narrative or themes, but with its blending of action, romance and comedy seamlessly coming together as a whole, Maverick is practically hard to dislike. Even the cast seem to be having a real good time, with Gibson smooth and roguish, Foster dainty yet spunky and Garner (the original Maverick from the TV show) offering up a sort of stoic maturity over proceedings; with all three playing the comedy with ease (how great it is to see Foster in such a role). Donner and Goldman have also shown respect to both the TV show and the Western in general (check out those lovely landscapes), while it's always fun to play spot the numerous stars in the cameos. Harmless fluff, then, but always watchable and never once over reaching itself by trying to be something it's not. 7.5/10

    A worthy little film on the far west the way we can see it today, a big farce. Everything is false. A woman is playing poker and picking pockets. A Marshall is robbing the bank of a poker competition, with the agreement of the organizer. All kinds of players who are cheating and trying to win with weapons or violence, or even unfair padlocks. Indians who are organizing wagon train attacks for some dollars and the killing of some fake Indians still for a lot of money from a Russian ambassador. In one word everything is false, a big lie and a big laugh between or among the gun fire and the bullets. And yet all those crooks are trying to steal one another and the only woman in the tale will get the last word, except that she will only get a small part of the stake. Never put all your eggs in one basket. The only real interest of this film is not to show you what the far west used to be but to make you enjoy a comedy about it and that comedy is of course absurd. And that's why it is funny with some good actors who can play surprise and fear and joy and pleasure (you see the one I mean) and horror just as if the rattle snake under their feet were a real rattle snake. It sounds like one all right but it is nothing but a fake plastic rattling device and it won't bite. Even though they had a rattle snake tamer on the team, or rather because. I guess he is the one who dubbed them for the rattling to sound really real. Speaking of Canada Dry. Well we are in the country of the saints, Saint Louis and so many others down to New Orleans.

    Love this film. It's silly, funny, irreverent and clever, and does not take itself seriously at all. Mel Gibson is at his most charming and irrepressible, and Jodie Foster dazzles as con-merchant and petite-criminal Annabelle Bransford, Bret Maverick's "nemesis" in the story. The plot is simply that Bret has to secure $25,000 to enter a poker tournament and he has some trouble raising the money given Annabelle trying to rip him off and Marshal Zane Cooper (James Garner - the original TV Maverick) doing his best to stop him getting to his destination. Bret is a fast-thinking, fast-talking trickster who's friendship with local Native American Indian Joseph (the brilliant Graham Greene) gets the trio out of a tight spot and also makes for the funniest scenes of the film. Some great stunts, amazing one-liners and a shocking disregard to the amounts of money they have pass through their hands (given it's set in the 1800s) make this an enjoyable, charming and pleasing film. Amusing cameo from Danny Glover (Lethal Weapon)

    This is a family favorite that I watched again with my girls. Mel Gibson was at his best during the 90s and is thoroughly enjoyable in this tongue-in-cheek, nothing-is-what-it-seems adventure. Jodie Foster as the pseudo Southern belle and James Garner reprising his TV role complement Gibson perfectly. The movie is presented in three acts. Act 1 sets up Gibson as the playful conman trying to earn just a bit more money to enter the "poker match of the century." Act 2 introduces Garner as Gibson's apparent foil trying both to earn the respect of Mrs. Bransford and, we gather, to keep an eye on Maverick. Act 3 is the poker match where everyone shows their true colors. Tons of fun and a great diversion. Eight of ten stars for the pure entertainment value.

    As TV show adaptations go, "Maverick" is a movie that excels because of a rollicking sense of fun and good humor. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and I think everyone involved is perfectly chosen for the job. The film opens with Mel Gibson's eponymous gambler, out to prove he's the best poker player. He's $3,000 short of the $25,000 buy-in, and his quest finds him in an unlikely partnership with like-minded gamblers Annabelle Bransford (Jodie Foster) and Marshall Zane Cooper (James Garner). And it's a journey that will see our hero tangle with rattlesnakes, renegade Indians and even a runaway stagecoach. "Maverick" is an Action/Adventure/Western/Comedy that runs high on likability and even a few great setpieces. Everyone involved is clearly having fun, and it goes a long way in inviting the audience in on the laugh. It's the kind of TV show adaptation that doesn't require the viewer to have seen the original show. There's enough here in the engaging protagonist to keep the audience interested in the free- standing story. And what an affable hero Maverick is, a role that greatly benefits from Mel Gibson's trademark boyish charm and joking sense of humor. It's not just Gibson; Foster and Garner also show an unexpected flair for comedy. Maybe the real star of "Maverick" is William Goldman's terrific screenplay; one that infuses the movie with a delightfully wry sense of humor and lightheartedness. In almost every scene, things aren't always as they seem; and it's usually played to great comedic effect. This is the movie that made me a Goldman fan (in my defense, I haven't yet seen his greatest hits, so to speak). I found myself constantly grinning from ear to ear. You don't even have to be a Western fan to appreciate "Maverick". It's just an overall likable movie. 8/10

    Maybe it wasn't really like this in the Old West but this film does fill me with the hope that at least sometimes it had these moments. This film is pure entertainment, not a historical documentary and certainly not, at any point, to be taken seriously. Maverick's (Mel Gibson's) character as a likable rogue had a surreal and very believable chemistry with Annabelle Bransford (Jodie Foster) and a pleasant nod to the "original" maverick that old standby, James Garner. The humour is firmly tongue-in-cheek and Foster does indeed "do southern" very acceptably and looks as radiant as any woman in the role could. Her unique brand of energy, injured innocence, scheming minxicity (I made that up) and twangy edginess give the part a solid and definitive profile. No man of Maverick's marque (or any other for that matter) could resist chasing a temptress of such charm, beauty and duplicity through a hundred countries to get his money back and would indeed have a wonderful time doing it. I'm not a Mel Gibson fan but this exceptional part was cast against type and Mel performed very well. As I said, the chemistry between Mel and Jodie is tangible, perhaps because they're close friends off-screen as well. Garner is solid, if a little pedestrian (don't mistake it for gravitas Mr. G), but since he's already got his (metaphorical) halo it's hard to find fault with him and particularly for his acceptably human (if feigned) reluctance to join a firefight with a bunch of drunken outlaws. Joseph (Graham Greene) is outstanding as is Angel (fellow countryman Alfred Molina who has proved himself many times since) as the kind of necessary semi-villain/rogue types that help show Maverick, no angel himself, in a slightly less predatory light. This film pretends to be nothing but what it is and that stands to its eternal credit. There's no doubt, given the cast performances, that this film was a hoot to make. Such films are vital to lighten our moods from the sombre turns they can take sometimes by reminding us that probably it was much worse in the past, and for exactly that reason, it might also have been quite a bit better.

    first things first - i am a big fan of mel Gibson and jodie foster, westerns and comedy. hence, its no surprise that i rather enjoyed the slickly made maverick. mel Gibson and jodie foster are simply brilliant and great fun to watch. the plot is pathetic and an excuse for a series of fun-filled capers and smart lines. the movie is filled with witticisms that are really cool, my favorite being danny glovers cameo and his line "im getting too old for this s**t". :) jodie foster looks absolutely adorable, mel Gibson is his usual dashing self. the downsides are the way too many plot twists towards the end, throwing one off the track and frankly they were rather unnecessary, quite annoying indeed. but in all its a fun movie for a relaxed evening, nothing great - just a lil bit of fun. a fun-filled 7!

    Let me say at the outset that Maverick is a hugely enjoyable humorous western. Coming right in the thick of Hollywood mining TV nostalgia in order to put big screen adaptations of popular TV series from yesteryear on screen, it is both a decent homage to its progenitor as well as being a very entertaining movie in its own right. It has a good, unpredictable story, an excellent cast who all perform well (especially the supporting characters), Mel Gibson makes an attractive Bret Maverick, and it is pleasing to see James Garner, TV's Bret Maverick, as Marshal Zane Cooper - such films like to place members of the original cast as a nod of approval, a way of linking the old to the new. And then the makers of this film play a trick on the audience (by which I mean those members who recall the original and are watching this film for the first time). I can't say anything about it other than that it involves confounding expectations, but it is a sheer delight when it dawns on the audience how thoroughly they have been had. I'm not a major Mel Gibson fan, but I do like this movie a lot.

    Plot: A card player in the Old West tries to win a cards tournament worth $250,000 but finds that someone is out to stop him. MAVERICK is a big screen adaptation of the old TV show about a gifted card player (and crook) in the Wild West. After learning about the tournament Maverick has to raise the $25,000 entrance fee, which is what he spends most of the movie doing. He finds himself chased by villains, hunted as human prey by a mad Russian noble and alternately assisted and hindered by a female grifter and a leathery old lawman. He also meets a bunch of post-modern Indians but the jokes are pretty thin and it only serves to pad the movie out far beyond what it ought to have been. The leads are good, the script fun and the direction competent yet the film never quite suckers you in. There are enough fights (OK), plot twists (a goodie at the end) and jokes to keep you going but it doesn't lift off and a good half-hour ought to have been left on the cutting room floor.

    'Maverick', directed by the legendary Richard Donner, is a genuinely entertaining film, that also manages some good laughs in the goings-on. The film is stylishly directed, wonderfully photographed & features a Fabulous performance by cult actor, Mel Gibson. Set in the American Old West, Gibson stars as Bret Maverick, a wisecracking gambler, on the way to a major five-card draw poker tournament. But on his way to reach his destination, he is faced by a women thief, a villain who wants to track him down & a legendary lawman. Based on the 1950s television series of the same name, created by Roy Huggins, 'Maverick' turns out to be Good Fun. The Screenplay is well-written and packs in several interesting moments. The Witty One-Liners, are hilarious and keep your interest alive. Donner's direction, like always, is effective. He has directed the Grand Climax, with style. Cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond, is wonderful. Editing is sharp. Costume Design is pitch-perfect. Performance-Wise: Gibson, as mentioned, delivers a Fabulous performance as Maverick. He gets his comic timing spot-on and plays his part with rare ease. Jodie Foster is efficient, as expected. James Garner is top-notch. Alfred Molina & Graham Greene are decent. James Coburn is terrific in a brief, yet substantial role. On the whole, 'Maverick' is an entertaining film, that is definitely worth a watch. Thumbs Up!

The Witty One-Liners, are hilarious and keep your interest alive. Donner's direction, like always, is effective. He has directed the Grand Climax, with style. Cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond, is wonderful. Editing is sharp. Costume Design is pitch-perfect. Performance-Wise: Gibson, as mentioned, delivers a Fabulous performance as Maverick. He gets his comic timing spot-on and plays his part with rare ease. Jodie Foster is efficient, as expected. James Garner is top-notch. Alfred Molina & Graham Greene are decent. James Coburn is terrific in a brief, yet substantial role. On the whole, 'Maverick' is an entertaining film, that is definitely worth a watch. Thumbs Up!

    Maverick is directed by Richard Donner and written by William Goldman. It stars Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster and James Garner, with support coming from Alfred Molina, Graham Greene and James Coburn. The music is scored by Randy Newman and Vilmos Zsigmond is on photography. It's based on the 1950s television series of the same name and the plot finds Gibson as Maverick and follows his attempt to take his place in a major five-card draw poker tournament. With Foster and Garner in tow, there's plenty of adventures and misadventures along the way. After Costner's Dances With Wolves and Eastwood's Unforgiven had reignited interest in the Western genre in the 90s, Richard Donner and his team felt the time was right to unleash a light hearted Western on the mainstream audience. Timing was important, as was the casting, but Maverick is the sort of family friendly fun that could in truth be released at any time in any decade and still be a hit at the box office. It's not particularly clever in narrative or themes, but with its blending of action, romance and comedy seamlessly coming together as a whole, Maverick is practically hard to dislike. Even the cast seem to be having a real good time, with Gibson smooth and roguish, Foster dainty yet spunky and Garner (the original Maverick from the TV show) offering up a sort of stoic maturity over proceedings; with all three playing the comedy with ease (how great it is to see Foster in such a role). Donner and Goldman have also shown respect to both the TV show and the Western in general (check out those lovely landscapes), while it's always fun to play spot the numerous stars in the cameos. Harmless fluff, then, but always watchable and never once over reaching itself by trying to be something it's not. 7.5/10

    A worthy little film on the far west the way we can see it today, a big farce. Everything is false. A woman is playing poker and picking pockets. A Marshall is robbing the bank of a poker competition, with the agreement of the organizer. All kinds of players who are cheating and trying to win with weapons or violence, or even unfair padlocks. Indians who are organizing wagon train attacks for some dollars and the killing of some fake Indians still for a lot of money from a Russian ambassador. In one word everything is false, a big lie and a big laugh between or among the gun fire and the bullets. And yet all those crooks are trying to steal one another and the only woman in the tale will get the last word, except that she will only get a small part of the stake. Never put all your eggs in one basket. The only real interest of this film is not to show you what the far west used to be but to make you enjoy a comedy about it and that comedy is of course absurd. And that's why it is funny with some good actors who can play surprise and fear and joy and pleasure (you see the one I mean) and horror just as if the rattle snake under their feet were a real rattle snake. It sounds like one all right but it is nothing but a fake plastic rattling device and it won't bite. Even though they had a rattle snake tamer on the team, or rather because. I guess he is the one who dubbed them for the rattling to sound really real. Speaking of Canada Dry. Well we are in the country of the saints, Saint Louis and so many others down to New Orleans.

    Love this film. It's silly, funny, irreverent and clever, and does not take itself seriously at all. Mel Gibson is at his most charming and irrepressible, and Jodie Foster dazzles as con-merchant and petite-criminal Annabelle Bransford, Bret Maverick's "nemesis" in the story. The plot is simply that Bret has to secure $25,000 to enter a poker tournament and he has some trouble raising the money given Annabelle trying to rip him off and Marshal Zane Cooper (James Garner - the original TV Maverick) doing his best to stop him getting to his destination. Bret is a fast-thinking, fast-talking trickster who's friendship with local Native American Indian Joseph (the brilliant Graham Greene) gets the trio out of a tight spot and also makes for the funniest scenes of the film. Some great stunts, amazing one-liners and a shocking disregard to the amounts of money they have pass through their hands (given it's set in the 1800s) make this an enjoyable, charming and pleasing film. Amusing cameo from Danny Glover (Lethal Weapon)

    This is a family favorite that I watched again with my girls. Mel Gibson was at his best during the 90s and is thoroughly enjoyable in this tongue-in-cheek, nothing-is-what-it-seems adventure. Jodie Foster as the pseudo Southern belle and James Garner reprising his TV role complement Gibson perfectly. The movie is presented in three acts. Act 1 sets up Gibson as the playful conman trying to earn just a bit more money to enter the "poker match of the century." Act 2 introduces Garner as Gibson's apparent foil trying both to earn the respect of Mrs. Bransford and, we gather, to keep an eye on Maverick. Act 3 is the poker match where everyone shows their true colors. Tons of fun and a great diversion. Eight of ten stars for the pure entertainment value.

    As TV show adaptations go, "Maverick" is a movie that excels because of a rollicking sense of fun and good humor. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and I think everyone involved is perfectly chosen for the job. The film opens with Mel Gibson's eponymous gambler, out to prove he's the best poker player. He's $3,000 short of the $25,000 buy-in, and his quest finds him in an unlikely partnership with like-minded gamblers Annabelle Bransford (Jodie Foster) and Marshall Zane Cooper (James Garner). And it's a journey that will see our hero tangle with rattlesnakes, renegade Indians and even a runaway stagecoach. "Maverick" is an Action/Adventure/Western/Comedy that runs high on likability and even a few great setpieces. Everyone involved is clearly having fun, and it goes a long way in inviting the audience in on the laugh. It's the kind of TV show adaptation that doesn't require the viewer to have seen the original show. There's enough here in the engaging protagonist to keep the audience interested in the free- standing story. And what an affable hero Maverick is, a role that greatly benefits from Mel Gibson's trademark boyish charm and joking sense of humor. It's not just Gibson; Foster and Garner also show an unexpected flair for comedy. Maybe the real star of "Maverick" is William Goldman's terrific screenplay; one that infuses the movie with a delightfully wry sense of humor and lightheartedness. In almost every scene, things aren't always as they seem; and it's usually played to great comedic effect. This is the movie that made me a Goldman fan (in my defense, I haven't yet seen his greatest hits, so to speak). I found myself constantly grinning from ear to ear. You don't even have to be a Western fan to appreciate "Maverick". It's just an overall likable movie. 8/10

    Maybe it wasn't really like this in the Old West but this film does fill me with the hope that at least sometimes it had these moments. This film is pure entertainment, not a historical documentary and certainly not, at any point, to be taken seriously. Maverick's (Mel Gibson's) character as a likable rogue had a surreal and very believable chemistry with Annabelle Bransford (Jodie Foster) and a pleasant nod to the "original" maverick that old standby, James Garner. The humour is firmly tongue-in-cheek and Foster does indeed "do southern" very acceptably and looks as radiant as any woman in the role could. Her unique brand of energy, injured innocence, scheming minxicity (I made that up) and twangy edginess give the part a solid and definitive profile. No man of Maverick's marque (or any other for that matter) could resist chasing a temptress of such charm, beauty and duplicity through a hundred countries to get his money back and would indeed have a wonderful time doing it. I'm not a Mel Gibson fan but this exceptional part was cast against type and Mel performed very well. As I said, the chemistry between Mel and Jodie is tangible, perhaps because they're close friends off-screen as well. Garner is solid, if a little pedestrian (don't mistake it for gravitas Mr. G), but since he's already got his (metaphorical) halo it's hard to find fault with him and particularly for his acceptably human (if feigned) reluctance to join a firefight with a bunch of drunken outlaws. Joseph (Graham Greene) is outstanding as is Angel (fellow countryman Alfred Molina who has proved himself many times since) as the kind of necessary semi-villain/rogue types that help show Maverick, no angel himself, in a slightly less predatory light. This film pretends to be nothing but what it is and that stands to its eternal credit. There's no doubt, given the cast performances, that this film was a hoot to make. Such films are vital to lighten our moods from the sombre turns they can take sometimes by reminding us that probably it was much worse in the past, and for exactly that reason, it might also have been quite a bit better.

    first things first - i am a big fan of mel Gibson and jodie foster, westerns and comedy. hence, its no surprise that i rather enjoyed the slickly made maverick. mel Gibson and jodie foster are simply brilliant and great fun to watch. the plot is pathetic and an excuse for a series of fun-filled capers and smart lines. the movie is filled with witticisms that are really cool, my favorite being danny glovers cameo and his line "im getting too old for this s**t". :) jodie foster looks absolutely adorable, mel Gibson is his usual dashing self. the downsides are the way too many plot twists towards the end, throwing one off the track and frankly they were rather unnecessary, quite annoying indeed. but in all its a fun movie for a relaxed evening, nothing great - just a lil bit of fun. a fun-filled 7!

    Let me say at the outset that Maverick is a hugely enjoyable humorous western. Coming right in the thick of Hollywood mining TV nostalgia in order to put big screen adaptations of popular TV series from yesteryear on screen, it is both a decent homage to its progenitor as well as being a very entertaining movie in its own right. It has a good, unpredictable story, an excellent cast who all perform well (especially the supporting characters), Mel Gibson makes an attractive Bret Maverick, and it is pleasing to see James Garner, TV's Bret Maverick, as Marshal Zane Cooper - such films like to place members of the original cast as a nod of approval, a way of linking the old to the new. And then the makers of this film play a trick on the audience (by which I mean those members who recall the original and are watching this film for the first time). I can't say anything about it other than that it involves confounding expectations, but it is a sheer delight when it dawns on the audience how thoroughly they have been had. I'm not a major Mel Gibson fan, but I do like this movie a lot.

    Plot: A card player in the Old West tries to win a cards tournament worth $250,000 but finds that someone is out to stop him. MAVERICK is a big screen adaptation of the old TV show about a gifted card player (and crook) in the Wild West. After learning about the tournament Maverick has to raise the $25,000 entrance fee, which is what he spends most of the movie doing. He finds himself chased by villains, hunted as human prey by a mad Russian noble and alternately assisted and hindered by a female grifter and a leathery old lawman. He also meets a bunch of post-modern Indians but the jokes are pretty thin and it only serves to pad the movie out far beyond what it ought to have been. The leads are good, the script fun and the direction competent yet the film never quite suckers you in. There are enough fights (OK), plot twists (a goodie at the end) and jokes to keep you going but it doesn't lift off and a good half-hour ought to have been left on the cutting room floor.

    'Maverick', directed by the legendary Richard Donner, is a genuinely entertaining film, that also manages some good laughs in the goings-on. The film is stylishly directed, wonderfully photographed & features a Fabulous performance by cult actor, Mel Gibson. Set in the American Old West, Gibson stars as Bret Maverick, a wisecracking gambler, on the way to a major five-card draw poker tournament. But on his way to reach his destination, he is faced by a women thief, a villain who wants to track him down & a legendary lawman. Based on the 1950s television series of the same name, created by Roy Huggins, 'Maverick' turns out to be Good Fun. The Screenplay is well-written and packs in several interesting moments. The Witty One-Liners, are hilarious and keep your interest alive. Donner's direction, like always, is effective. He has directed the Grand Climax, with style. Cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond, is wonderful. Editing is sharp. Costume Design is pitch-perfect. Performance-Wise: Gibson, as mentioned, delivers a Fabulous performance as Maverick. He gets his comic timing spot-on and plays his part with rare ease. Jodie Foster is efficient, as expected. James Garner is top-notch. Alfred Molina & Graham Greene are decent. James Coburn is terrific in a brief, yet substantial role. On the whole, 'Maverick' is an entertaining film, that is definitely worth a watch. Thumbs Up!

The leads are good, the script fun and the direction competent yet the film never quite suckers you in. There are enough fights (OK), plot twists (a goodie at the end) and jokes to keep you going but it doesn't lift off and a good half-hour ought to have been left on the cutting room floor.

    'Maverick', directed by the legendary Richard Donner, is a genuinely entertaining film, that also manages some good laughs in the goings-on. The film is stylishly directed, wonderfully photographed & features a Fabulous performance by cult actor, Mel Gibson. Set in the American Old West, Gibson stars as Bret Maverick, a wisecracking gambler, on the way to a major five-card draw poker tournament. But on his way to reach his destination, he is faced by a women thief, a villain who wants to track him down & a legendary lawman. Based on the 1950s television series of the same name, created by Roy Huggins, 'Maverick' turns out to be Good Fun. The Screenplay is well-written and packs in several interesting moments. The Witty One-Liners, are hilarious and keep your interest alive. Donner's direction, like always, is effective. He has directed the Grand Climax, with style. Cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond, is wonderful. Editing is sharp. Costume Design is pitch-perfect. Performance-Wise: Gibson, as mentioned, delivers a Fabulous performance as Maverick. He gets his comic timing spot-on and plays his part with rare ease. Jodie Foster is efficient, as expected. James Garner is top-notch. Alfred Molina & Graham Greene are decent. James Coburn is terrific in a brief, yet substantial role. On the whole, 'Maverick' is an entertaining film, that is definitely worth a watch. Thumbs Up!

    Maverick is directed by Richard Donner and written by William Goldman. It stars Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster and James Garner, with support coming from Alfred Molina, Graham Greene and James Coburn. The music is scored by Randy Newman and Vilmos Zsigmond is on photography. It's based on the 1950s television series of the same name and the plot finds Gibson as Maverick and follows his attempt to take his place in a major five-card draw poker tournament. With Foster and Garner in tow, there's plenty of adventures and misadventures along the way. After Costner's Dances With Wolves and Eastwood's Unforgiven had reignited interest in the Western genre in the 90s, Richard Donner and his team felt the time was right to unleash a light hearted Western on the mainstream audience. Timing was important, as was the casting, but Maverick is the sort of family friendly fun that could in truth be released at any time in any decade and still be a hit at the box office. It's not particularly clever in narrative or themes, but with its blending of action, romance and comedy seamlessly coming together as a whole, Maverick is practically hard to dislike. Even the cast seem to be having a real good time, with Gibson smooth and roguish, Foster dainty yet spunky and Garner (the original Maverick from the TV show) offering up a sort of stoic maturity over proceedings; with all three playing the comedy with ease (how great it is to see Foster in such a role). Donner and Goldman have also shown respect to both the TV show and the Western in general (check out those lovely landscapes), while it's always fun to play spot the numerous stars in the cameos. Harmless fluff, then, but always watchable and never once over reaching itself by trying to be something it's not. 7.5/10

    A worthy little film on the far west the way we can see it today, a big farce. Everything is false. A woman is playing poker and picking pockets. A Marshall is robbing the bank of a poker competition, with the agreement of the organizer. All kinds of players who are cheating and trying to win with weapons or violence, or even unfair padlocks. Indians who are organizing wagon train attacks for some dollars and the killing of some fake Indians still for a lot of money from a Russian ambassador. In one word everything is false, a big lie and a big laugh between or among the gun fire and the bullets. And yet all those crooks are trying to steal one another and the only woman in the tale will get the last word, except that she will only get a small part of the stake. Never put all your eggs in one basket. The only real interest of this film is not to show you what the far west used to be but to make you enjoy a comedy about it and that comedy is of course absurd. And that's why it is funny with some good actors who can play surprise and fear and joy and pleasure (you see the one I mean) and horror just as if the rattle snake under their feet were a real rattle snake. It sounds like one all right but it is nothing but a fake plastic rattling device and it won't bite. Even though they had a rattle snake tamer on the team, or rather because. I guess he is the one who dubbed them for the rattling to sound really real. Speaking of Canada Dry. Well we are in the country of the saints, Saint Louis and so many others down to New Orleans.

    Love this film. It's silly, funny, irreverent and clever, and does not take itself seriously at all. Mel Gibson is at his most charming and irrepressible, and Jodie Foster dazzles as con-merchant and petite-criminal Annabelle Bransford, Bret Maverick's "nemesis" in the story. The plot is simply that Bret has to secure $25,000 to enter a poker tournament and he has some trouble raising the money given Annabelle trying to rip him off and Marshal Zane Cooper (James Garner - the original TV Maverick) doing his best to stop him getting to his destination. Bret is a fast-thinking, fast-talking trickster who's friendship with local Native American Indian Joseph (the brilliant Graham Greene) gets the trio out of a tight spot and also makes for the funniest scenes of the film. Some great stunts, amazing one-liners and a shocking disregard to the amounts of money they have pass through their hands (given it's set in the 1800s) make this an enjoyable, charming and pleasing film. Amusing cameo from Danny Glover (Lethal Weapon)

    This is a family favorite that I watched again with my girls. Mel Gibson was at his best during the 90s and is thoroughly enjoyable in this tongue-in-cheek, nothing-is-what-it-seems adventure. Jodie Foster as the pseudo Southern belle and James Garner reprising his TV role complement Gibson perfectly. The movie is presented in three acts. Act 1 sets up Gibson as the playful conman trying to earn just a bit more money to enter the "poker match of the century." Act 2 introduces Garner as Gibson's apparent foil trying both to earn the respect of Mrs. Bransford and, we gather, to keep an eye on Maverick. Act 3 is the poker match where everyone shows their true colors. Tons of fun and a great diversion. Eight of ten stars for the pure entertainment value.

    As TV show adaptations go, "Maverick" is a movie that excels because of a rollicking sense of fun and good humor. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and I think everyone involved is perfectly chosen for the job. The film opens with Mel Gibson's eponymous gambler, out to prove he's the best poker player. He's $3,000 short of the $25,000 buy-in, and his quest finds him in an unlikely partnership with like-minded gamblers Annabelle Bransford (Jodie Foster) and Marshall Zane Cooper (James Garner). And it's a journey that will see our hero tangle with rattlesnakes, renegade Indians and even a runaway stagecoach. "Maverick" is an Action/Adventure/Western/Comedy that runs high on likability and even a few great setpieces. Everyone involved is clearly having fun, and it goes a long way in inviting the audience in on the laugh. It's the kind of TV show adaptation that doesn't require the viewer to have seen the original show. There's enough here in the engaging protagonist to keep the audience interested in the free- standing story. And what an affable hero Maverick is, a role that greatly benefits from Mel Gibson's trademark boyish charm and joking sense of humor. It's not just Gibson; Foster and Garner also show an unexpected flair for comedy. Maybe the real star of "Maverick" is William Goldman's terrific screenplay; one that infuses the movie with a delightfully wry sense of humor and lightheartedness. In almost every scene, things aren't always as they seem; and it's usually played to great comedic effect. This is the movie that made me a Goldman fan (in my defense, I haven't yet seen his greatest hits, so to speak). I found myself constantly grinning from ear to ear. You don't even have to be a Western fan to appreciate "Maverick". It's just an overall likable movie. 8/10

    Maybe it wasn't really like this in the Old West but this film does fill me with the hope that at least sometimes it had these moments. This film is pure entertainment, not a historical documentary and certainly not, at any point, to be taken seriously. Maverick's (Mel Gibson's) character as a likable rogue had a surreal and very believable chemistry with Annabelle Bransford (Jodie Foster) and a pleasant nod to the "original" maverick that old standby, James Garner. The humour is firmly tongue-in-cheek and Foster does indeed "do southern" very acceptably and looks as radiant as any woman in the role could. Her unique brand of energy, injured innocence, scheming minxicity (I made that up) and twangy edginess give the part a solid and definitive profile. No man of Maverick's marque (or any other for that matter) could resist chasing a temptress of such charm, beauty and duplicity through a hundred countries to get his money back and would indeed have a wonderful time doing it. I'm not a Mel Gibson fan but this exceptional part was cast against type and Mel performed very well. As I said, the chemistry between Mel and Jodie is tangible, perhaps because they're close friends off-screen as well. Garner is solid, if a little pedestrian (don't mistake it for gravitas Mr. G), but since he's already got his (metaphorical) halo it's hard to find fault with him and particularly for his acceptably human (if feigned) reluctance to join a firefight with a bunch of drunken outlaws. Joseph (Graham Greene) is outstanding as is Angel (fellow countryman Alfred Molina who has proved himself many times since) as the kind of necessary semi-villain/rogue types that help show Maverick, no angel himself, in a slightly less predatory light. This film pretends to be nothing but what it is and that stands to its eternal credit. There's no doubt, given the cast performances, that this film was a hoot to make. Such films are vital to lighten our moods from the sombre turns they can take sometimes by reminding us that probably it was much worse in the past, and for exactly that reason, it might also have been quite a bit better.

    first things first - i am a big fan of mel Gibson and jodie foster, westerns and comedy. hence, its no surprise that i rather enjoyed the slickly made maverick. mel Gibson and jodie foster are simply brilliant and great fun to watch. the plot is pathetic and an excuse for a series of fun-filled capers and smart lines. the movie is filled with witticisms that are really cool, my favorite being danny glovers cameo and his line "im getting too old for this s**t". :) jodie foster looks absolutely adorable, mel Gibson is his usual dashing self. the downsides are the way too many plot twists towards the end, throwing one off the track and frankly they were rather unnecessary, quite annoying indeed. but in all its a fun movie for a relaxed evening, nothing great - just a lil bit of fun. a fun-filled 7!

    Let me say at the outset that Maverick is a hugely enjoyable humorous western. Coming right in the thick of Hollywood mining TV nostalgia in order to put big screen adaptations of popular TV series from yesteryear on screen, it is both a decent homage to its progenitor as well as being a very entertaining movie in its own right. It has a good, unpredictable story, an excellent cast who all perform well (especially the supporting characters), Mel Gibson makes an attractive Bret Maverick, and it is pleasing to see James Garner, TV's Bret Maverick, as Marshal Zane Cooper - such films like to place members of the original cast as a nod of approval, a way of linking the old to the new. And then the makers of this film play a trick on the audience (by which I mean those members who recall the original and are watching this film for the first time). I can't say anything about it other than that it involves confounding expectations, but it is a sheer delight when it dawns on the audience how thoroughly they have been had. I'm not a major Mel Gibson fan, but I do like this movie a lot.

    Plot: A card player in the Old West tries to win a cards tournament worth $250,000 but finds that someone is out to stop him. MAVERICK is a big screen adaptation of the old TV show about a gifted card player (and crook) in the Wild West. After learning about the tournament Maverick has to raise the $25,000 entrance fee, which is what he spends most of the movie doing. He finds himself chased by villains, hunted as human prey by a mad Russian noble and alternately assisted and hindered by a female grifter and a leathery old lawman. He also meets a bunch of post-modern Indians but the jokes are pretty thin and it only serves to pad the movie out far beyond what it ought to have been. The leads are good, the script fun and the direction competent yet the film never quite suckers you in. There are enough fights (OK), plot twists (a goodie at the end) and jokes to keep you going but it doesn't lift off and a good half-hour ought to have been left on the cutting room floor.

I can't say anything about it other than that it involves confounding expectations, but it is a sheer delight when it dawns on the audience how thoroughly they have been had. I'm not a major Mel Gibson fan, but I do like this movie a lot.

    Plot: A card player in the Old West tries to win a cards tournament worth $250,000 but finds that someone is out to stop him. MAVERICK is a big screen adaptation of the old TV show about a gifted card player (and crook) in the Wild West. After learning about the tournament Maverick has to raise the $25,000 entrance fee, which is what he spends most of the movie doing. He finds himself chased by villains, hunted as human prey by a mad Russian noble and alternately assisted and hindered by a female grifter and a leathery old lawman. He also meets a bunch of post-modern Indians but the jokes are pretty thin and it only serves to pad the movie out far beyond what it ought to have been. The leads are good, the script fun and the direction competent yet the film never quite suckers you in. There are enough fights (OK), plot twists (a goodie at the end) and jokes to keep you going but it doesn't lift off and a good half-hour ought to have been left on the cutting room floor.

    'Maverick', directed by the legendary Richard Donner, is a genuinely entertaining film, that also manages some good laughs in the goings-on. The film is stylishly directed, wonderfully photographed & features a Fabulous performance by cult actor, Mel Gibson. Set in the American Old West, Gibson stars as Bret Maverick, a wisecracking gambler, on the way to a major five-card draw poker tournament. But on his way to reach his destination, he is faced by a women thief, a villain who wants to track him down & a legendary lawman. Based on the 1950s television series of the same name, created by Roy Huggins, 'Maverick' turns out to be Good Fun. The Screenplay is well-written and packs in several interesting moments. The Witty One-Liners, are hilarious and keep your interest alive. Donner's direction, like always, is effective. He has directed the Grand Climax, with style. Cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond, is wonderful. Editing is sharp. Costume Design is pitch-perfect. Performance-Wise: Gibson, as mentioned, delivers a Fabulous performance as Maverick. He gets his comic timing spot-on and plays his part with rare ease. Jodie Foster is efficient, as expected. James Garner is top-notch. Alfred Molina & Graham Greene are decent. James Coburn is terrific in a brief, yet substantial role. On the whole, 'Maverick' is an entertaining film, that is definitely worth a watch. Thumbs Up!

    Maverick is directed by Richard Donner and written by William Goldman. It stars Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster and James Garner, with support coming from Alfred Molina, Graham Greene and James Coburn. The music is scored by Randy Newman and Vilmos Zsigmond is on photography. It's based on the 1950s television series of the same name and the plot finds Gibson as Maverick and follows his attempt to take his place in a major five-card draw poker tournament. With Foster and Garner in tow, there's plenty of adventures and misadventures along the way. After Costner's Dances With Wolves and Eastwood's Unforgiven had reignited interest in the Western genre in the 90s, Richard Donner and his team felt the time was right to unleash a light hearted Western on the mainstream audience. Timing was important, as was the casting, but Maverick is the sort of family friendly fun that could in truth be released at any time in any decade and still be a hit at the box office. It's not particularly clever in narrative or themes, but with its blending of action, romance and comedy seamlessly coming together as a whole, Maverick is practically hard to dislike. Even the cast seem to be having a real good time, with Gibson smooth and roguish, Foster dainty yet spunky and Garner (the original Maverick from the TV show) offering up a sort of stoic maturity over proceedings; with all three playing the comedy with ease (how great it is to see Foster in such a role). Donner and Goldman have also shown respect to both the TV show and the Western in general (check out those lovely landscapes), while it's always fun to play spot the numerous stars in the cameos. Harmless fluff, then, but always watchable and never once over reaching itself by trying to be something it's not. 7.5/10

    A worthy little film on the far west the way we can see it today, a big farce. Everything is false. A woman is playing poker and picking pockets. A Marshall is robbing the bank of a poker competition, with the agreement of the organizer. All kinds of players who are cheating and trying to win with weapons or violence, or even unfair padlocks. Indians who are organizing wagon train attacks for some dollars and the killing of some fake Indians still for a lot of money from a Russian ambassador. In one word everything is false, a big lie and a big laugh between or among the gun fire and the bullets. And yet all those crooks are trying to steal one another and the only woman in the tale will get the last word, except that she will only get a small part of the stake. Never put all your eggs in one basket. The only real interest of this film is not to show you what the far west used to be but to make you enjoy a comedy about it and that comedy is of course absurd. And that's why it is funny with some good actors who can play surprise and fear and joy and pleasure (you see the one I mean) and horror just as if the rattle snake under their feet were a real rattle snake. It sounds like one all right but it is nothing but a fake plastic rattling device and it won't bite. Even though they had a rattle snake tamer on the team, or rather because. I guess he is the one who dubbed them for the rattling to sound really real. Speaking of Canada Dry. Well we are in the country of the saints, Saint Louis and so many others down to New Orleans.

    Love this film. It's silly, funny, irreverent and clever, and does not take itself seriously at all. Mel Gibson is at his most charming and irrepressible, and Jodie Foster dazzles as con-merchant and petite-criminal Annabelle Bransford, Bret Maverick's "nemesis" in the story. The plot is simply that Bret has to secure $25,000 to enter a poker tournament and he has some trouble raising the money given Annabelle trying to rip him off and Marshal Zane Cooper (James Garner - the original TV Maverick) doing his best to stop him getting to his destination. Bret is a fast-thinking, fast-talking trickster who's friendship with local Native American Indian Joseph (the brilliant Graham Greene) gets the trio out of a tight spot and also makes for the funniest scenes of the film. Some great stunts, amazing one-liners and a shocking disregard to the amounts of money they have pass through their hands (given it's set in the 1800s) make this an enjoyable, charming and pleasing film. Amusing cameo from Danny Glover (Lethal Weapon)

    This is a family favorite that I watched again with my girls. Mel Gibson was at his best during the 90s and is thoroughly enjoyable in this tongue-in-cheek, nothing-is-what-it-seems adventure. Jodie Foster as the pseudo Southern belle and James Garner reprising his TV role complement Gibson perfectly. The movie is presented in three acts. Act 1 sets up Gibson as the playful conman trying to earn just a bit more money to enter the "poker match of the century." Act 2 introduces Garner as Gibson's apparent foil trying both to earn the respect of Mrs. Bransford and, we gather, to keep an eye on Maverick. Act 3 is the poker match where everyone shows their true colors. Tons of fun and a great diversion. Eight of ten stars for the pure entertainment value.

    As TV show adaptations go, "Maverick" is a movie that excels because of a rollicking sense of fun and good humor. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and I think everyone involved is perfectly chosen for the job. The film opens with Mel Gibson's eponymous gambler, out to prove he's the best poker player. He's $3,000 short of the $25,000 buy-in, and his quest finds him in an unlikely partnership with like-minded gamblers Annabelle Bransford (Jodie Foster) and Marshall Zane Cooper (James Garner). And it's a journey that will see our hero tangle with rattlesnakes, renegade Indians and even a runaway stagecoach. "Maverick" is an Action/Adventure/Western/Comedy that runs high on likability and even a few great setpieces. Everyone involved is clearly having fun, and it goes a long way in inviting the audience in on the laugh. It's the kind of TV show adaptation that doesn't require the viewer to have seen the original show. There's enough here in the engaging protagonist to keep the audience interested in the free- standing story. And what an affable hero Maverick is, a role that greatly benefits from Mel Gibson's trademark boyish charm and joking sense of humor. It's not just Gibson; Foster and Garner also show an unexpected flair for comedy. Maybe the real star of "Maverick" is William Goldman's terrific screenplay; one that infuses the movie with a delightfully wry sense of humor and lightheartedness. In almost every scene, things aren't always as they seem; and it's usually played to great comedic effect. This is the movie that made me a Goldman fan (in my defense, I haven't yet seen his greatest hits, so to speak). I found myself constantly grinning from ear to ear. You don't even have to be a Western fan to appreciate "Maverick". It's just an overall likable movie. 8/10

    Maybe it wasn't really like this in the Old West but this film does fill me with the hope that at least sometimes it had these moments. This film is pure entertainment, not a historical documentary and certainly not, at any point, to be taken seriously. Maverick's (Mel Gibson's) character as a likable rogue had a surreal and very believable chemistry with Annabelle Bransford (Jodie Foster) and a pleasant nod to the "original" maverick that old standby, James Garner. The humour is firmly tongue-in-cheek and Foster does indeed "do southern" very acceptably and looks as radiant as any woman in the role could. Her unique brand of energy, injured innocence, scheming minxicity (I made that up) and twangy edginess give the part a solid and definitive profile. No man of Maverick's marque (or any other for that matter) could resist chasing a temptress of such charm, beauty and duplicity through a hundred countries to get his money back and would indeed have a wonderful time doing it. I'm not a Mel Gibson fan but this exceptional part was cast against type and Mel performed very well. As I said, the chemistry between Mel and Jodie is tangible, perhaps because they're close friends off-screen as well. Garner is solid, if a little pedestrian (don't mistake it for gravitas Mr. G), but since he's already got his (metaphorical) halo it's hard to find fault with him and particularly for his acceptably human (if feigned) reluctance to join a firefight with a bunch of drunken outlaws. Joseph (Graham Greene) is outstanding as is Angel (fellow countryman Alfred Molina who has proved himself many times since) as the kind of necessary semi-villain/rogue types that help show Maverick, no angel himself, in a slightly less predatory light. This film pretends to be nothing but what it is and that stands to its eternal credit. There's no doubt, given the cast performances, that this film was a hoot to make. Such films are vital to lighten our moods from the sombre turns they can take sometimes by reminding us that probably it was much worse in the past, and for exactly that reason, it might also have been quite a bit better.

    first things first - i am a big fan of mel Gibson and jodie foster, westerns and comedy. hence, its no surprise that i rather enjoyed the slickly made maverick. mel Gibson and jodie foster are simply brilliant and great fun to watch. the plot is pathetic and an excuse for a series of fun-filled capers and smart lines. the movie is filled with witticisms that are really cool, my favorite being danny glovers cameo and his line "im getting too old for this s**t". :) jodie foster looks absolutely adorable, mel Gibson is his usual dashing self. the downsides are the way too many plot twists towards the end, throwing one off the track and frankly they were rather unnecessary, quite annoying indeed. but in all its a fun movie for a relaxed evening, nothing great - just a lil bit of fun. a fun-filled 7!

    Let me say at the outset that Maverick is a hugely enjoyable humorous western. Coming right in the thick of Hollywood mining TV nostalgia in order to put big screen adaptations of popular TV series from yesteryear on screen, it is both a decent homage to its progenitor as well as being a very entertaining movie in its own right. It has a good, unpredictable story, an excellent cast who all perform well (especially the supporting characters), Mel Gibson makes an attractive Bret Maverick, and it is pleasing to see James Garner, TV's Bret Maverick, as Marshal Zane Cooper - such films like to place members of the original cast as a nod of approval, a way of linking the old to the new. And then the makers of this film play a trick on the audience (by which I mean those members who recall the original and are watching this film for the first time). I can't say anything about it other than that it involves confounding expectations, but it is a sheer delight when it dawns on the audience how thoroughly they have been had.

    first things first - i am a big fan of mel Gibson and jodie foster, westerns and comedy. hence, its no surprise that i rather enjoyed the slickly made maverick. mel Gibson and jodie foster are simply brilliant and great fun to watch. the plot is pathetic and an excuse for a series of fun-filled capers and smart lines. the movie is filled with witticisms that are really cool, my favorite being danny glovers cameo and his line "im getting too old for this s**t". :) jodie foster looks absolutely adorable, mel Gibson is his usual dashing self. the downsides are the way too many plot twists towards the end, throwing one off the track and frankly they were rather unnecessary, quite annoying indeed. but in all its a fun movie for a relaxed evening, nothing great - just a lil bit of fun. a fun-filled 7!

    Let me say at the outset that Maverick is a hugely enjoyable humorous western. Coming right in the thick of Hollywood mining TV nostalgia in order to put big screen adaptations of popular TV series from yesteryear on screen, it is both a decent homage to its progenitor as well as being a very entertaining movie in its own right. It has a good, unpredictable story, an excellent cast who all perform well (especially the supporting characters), Mel Gibson makes an attractive Bret Maverick, and it is pleasing to see James Garner, TV's Bret Maverick, as Marshal Zane Cooper - such films like to place members of the original cast as a nod of approval, a way of linking the old to the new. And then the makers of this film play a trick on the audience (by which I mean those members who recall the original and are watching this film for the first time). I can't say anything about it other than that it involves confounding expectations, but it is a sheer delight when it dawns on the audience how thoroughly they have been had. I'm not a major Mel Gibson fan, but I do like this movie a lot.

    Plot: A card player in the Old West tries to win a cards tournament worth $250,000 but finds that someone is out to stop him. MAVERICK is a big screen adaptation of the old TV show about a gifted card player (and crook) in the Wild West. After learning about the tournament Maverick has to raise the $25,000 entrance fee, which is what he spends most of the movie doing. He finds himself chased by villains, hunted as human prey by a mad Russian noble and alternately assisted and hindered by a female grifter and a leathery old lawman. He also meets a bunch of post-modern Indians but the jokes are pretty thin and it only serves to pad the movie out far beyond what it ought to have been. The leads are good, the script fun and the direction competent yet the film never quite suckers you in. There are enough fights (OK), plot twists (a goodie at the end) and jokes to keep you going but it doesn't lift off and a good half-hour ought to have been left on the cutting room floor.

    'Maverick', directed by the legendary Richard Donner, is a genuinely entertaining film, that also manages some good laughs in the goings-on. The film is stylishly directed, wonderfully photographed & features a Fabulous performance by cult actor, Mel Gibson. Set in the American Old West, Gibson stars as Bret Maverick, a wisecracking gambler, on the way to a major five-card draw poker tournament. But on his way to reach his destination, he is faced by a women thief, a villain who wants to track him down & a legendary lawman. Based on the 1950s television series of the same name, created by Roy Huggins, 'Maverick' turns out to be Good Fun. The Screenplay is well-written and packs in several interesting moments. The Witty One-Liners, are hilarious and keep your interest alive. Donner's direction, like always, is effective. He has directed the Grand Climax, with style. Cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond, is wonderful. Editing is sharp. Costume Design is pitch-perfect. Performance-Wise: Gibson, as mentioned, delivers a Fabulous performance as Maverick. He gets his comic timing spot-on and plays his part with rare ease. Jodie Foster is efficient, as expected. James Garner is top-notch. Alfred Molina & Graham Greene are decent. James Coburn is terrific in a brief, yet substantial role. On the whole, 'Maverick' is an entertaining film, that is definitely worth a watch. Thumbs Up!

    Maverick is directed by Richard Donner and written by William Goldman. It stars Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster and James Garner, with support coming from Alfred Molina, Graham Greene and James Coburn. The music is scored by Randy Newman and Vilmos Zsigmond is on photography. It's based on the 1950s television series of the same name and the plot finds Gibson as Maverick and follows his attempt to take his place in a major five-card draw poker tournament. With Foster and Garner in tow, there's plenty of adventures and misadventures along the way. After Costner's Dances With Wolves and Eastwood's Unforgiven had reignited interest in the Western genre in the 90s, Richard Donner and his team felt the time was right to unleash a light hearted Western on the mainstream audience. Timing was important, as was the casting, but Maverick is the sort of family friendly fun that could in truth be released at any time in any decade and still be a hit at the box office. It's not particularly clever in narrative or themes, but with its blending of action, romance and comedy seamlessly coming together as a whole, Maverick is practically hard to dislike. Even the cast seem to be having a real good time, with Gibson smooth and roguish, Foster dainty yet spunky and Garner (the original Maverick from the TV show) offering up a sort of stoic maturity over proceedings; with all three playing the comedy with ease (how great it is to see Foster in such a role). Donner and Goldman have also shown respect to both the TV show and the Western in general (check out those lovely landscapes), while it's always fun to play spot the numerous stars in the cameos. Harmless fluff, then, but always watchable and never once over reaching itself by trying to be something it's not. 7.5/10

    A worthy little film on the far west the way we can see it today, a big farce. Everything is false. A woman is playing poker and picking pockets. A Marshall is robbing the bank of a poker competition, with the agreement of the organizer. All kinds of players who are cheating and trying to win with weapons or violence, or even unfair padlocks. Indians who are organizing wagon train attacks for some dollars and the killing of some fake Indians still for a lot of money from a Russian ambassador. In one word everything is false, a big lie and a big laugh between or among the gun fire and the bullets. And yet all those crooks are trying to steal one another and the only woman in the tale will get the last word, except that she will only get a small part of the stake. Never put all your eggs in one basket. The only real interest of this film is not to show you what the far west used to be but to make you enjoy a comedy about it and that comedy is of course absurd. And that's why it is funny with some good actors who can play surprise and fear and joy and pleasure (you see the one I mean) and horror just as if the rattle snake under their feet were a real rattle snake. It sounds like one all right but it is nothing but a fake plastic rattling device and it won't bite. Even though they had a rattle snake tamer on the team, or rather because. I guess he is the one who dubbed them for the rattling to sound really real. Speaking of Canada Dry. Well we are in the country of the saints, Saint Louis and so many others down to New Orleans.
