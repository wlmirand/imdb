    "George of the Jungle" was released in 1997 to moderate critical acclaim, children love the movie, it is very cartoonish. What some people fail to recognize or don't know is that this film is a remake of a 1967 cartoon TV series. John Cleese co-stars as the voice of the "Ape named Ape" which is probably the funniest part of the film. Also, the elephant who acts and thinks he is a dog, Shemp is pure Disney fun. Thomas Haden Church plays the seemingly bad guy Lyle Van de Groot, and Leslie Mann plays Ursula Stanhope, the good girl. They went into the jungle as a couple, but Ursula and George leave together. A love story like Tarzan & Jane!

    The only truly memorable scene in this movie was the stunt at the Golden Gate Bridge-it was actually rather impressive. The rest, however, was trite, dull, and repetitive. George, an inept Tarzan-like man, is found by Ursula in the jungle, and she takes him to the city, and of course there are problems with that. The original "George Of The Jungle" episodes were short cartoons, not necessarily suited for conversion to a feature-length film, as other such efforts such as "Dudley Do-Right" have proved. Though the movie does make a real effort to keep as close to the original cartoon as possible, the sad truth is that the whole thing just didn't work. Fortunately, the fad for such efforts has long died off, so we don't have to worry about seeing Hong Kong Phooey or Tennessee Tuxedo getting such treatment.

    "George of the Jungle" is an earlier example of CGI movies (the jungle images here look fake compared to the ones in present-day movies). The characters are nice enough, and there are some funny moments, but the movie probably won't get many laughs from adults (George crashing into trees gets old quickly because it happens so often, and the bathroom humor is also repeated more than once), and the end of the movie is not surprising considering the plot of the story. For me, the funny parts are where George is having so much trouble adjusting to civilization (making animal calls while riding in the car, not knowing what some common items are because he's never seen them before, not knowing how to interact with other humans). Overall, this is an OK movie but not a great one. Kids will probably laugh at the humor in this movie, but most adults won't find it nearly as funny.

    Brendan Fraser from The Mummy franchise plays George a Tarzan lookalike who's been reared by a gorilla(voiced by John Cleese)and lives in the jungle with the gorillas and apes. Problems arise when he meets Ursula(played by This Is 40 star Leslie Mann)who's engaged to a borish douchbag (played by Thomas Haden Church from Spiderman 3)and he later falls for her. The story maybe a rip off of Tarzan but the over the top humor is hilarious and you gotta love the theme song and the romance between Mann and Fraiser. Im giving it an 8 out of 10.

    I used to watch this as a child and thoroughly enjoyed it back when it came out. I recently watched it again after decades and even though the CG is vastly different from what it is today, it is still an enjoyable movie. The talking monkeys in the movie look very realistic compared to what they would try in this day and age. The narrator in the movie is not annoying as I thought it was going to be as I watched it again as an adult, instead it added to the amusement. I recommend it for parents that like to pass on this movie to their kids. They may not understand some jokes but the majority of it is still understandable. George's antics can make the whole movie for a child. It did for me. It doesn't hurt to look at Brendan Fraser neither!

    This promised to be an entertaining family flick. The ingredients seem just right, talking animals, lady falls in love with a jungle man, fianc&eacute; gets jealous etc. Brendan Fraser pulls of the role reasonably well. John Cleese is well cast as the voice of an ape. However the rest is pulled off terribly. Barring the special effects (which are actually very good), there is little more in this film that might move it up the 'must watch holiday family flick' list. A lot more could and should have been made of this and what little slapstick there is could have been even funnier. the action however is reasonably well choreographed. The problem is that most of it is quite 'reasonable' and not a single element is outstanding.

    Those who know me know I HATE stupid comedy. I must admit that I watched this movie simply because B. Fraser starred in it: I have a long-standing crush on the man. I knew, going into it, that it'd be a silly movie with dull humor. Still, I was pleasantly surprised. The humor is dry and stupid most of the time, but the storyline makes up for it. And, as I recall from my childhood, George was always a bit dimwitted anyway. So I could deal with the stupidity of the movie and enjoy it for what it was--a child's film with adult undertones. And Brendan Fraser in a loincloth......need I say more?

    I have to say that this film has a lot of dumbness mixed in there with a lot of potential. First, it has a great cast like Holland Taylor as Mrs. Stanhope who you don't see enough of in this film. The animals are largely added in to talk and the elephant acts more like a dog than an elephant. John Cleese is a hoot as the ape who can speak Queen's English and you raised George in the jungle. Anyway, Thomas Haden Church plays Lyle who is with his fianc&eacute; Ursula Stanhope played by Lesley Mann in the jungle but the jungle sets don't look real. Anyway, it's a comedy aimed at a younger audience. Brendan Frasier is fine as George of the jungle but I don't like when he acts like an ape, grunts, or howls. But still there is a sweet love story in there. Abraham Benrubi plays a poacher and the narrator even has a sense of humor too. It's silly childish humor!

    I remember watching this movie as a very small boy and loving it. Years later and nothing has changed. It is full of very funny moments and has a nice story line. It is about the King of the Jungle George (Brandon Frasier) who always crashes in to trees but still is a strong, brave and good hero. He rescues and falls in love with Ursula Stanhope (Leslie Mann) a wealthy American from San Fransisco. However she is engaged to the cowardly and arrogant Lyle who shots and injuries George were he goes to San Fransisco with Ursula to be given treatment. Meanwhile George's brother Ape (John Cleese) is kidnapped by two poachers (Greg Cruttwell and Abraham Benrubi). All of the actors give a great performance. Cleece does a great job as Ape who is a scientific primate brother of George. Frasier does a fantastic job as George whose naive and clumsy behavior is a joy to watch. This is definitely worth watch and I recommend it to all young and old.

    I must say that George of the Jungle is a Pretty Good Movie. I really liked it. Brendan Fraser gave an excellent performance as a man named George who grows up in the jungle after being separated from his family from a plane accident when he was a baby. The rest of the cast give good performances and there are a bunch of hilarious scenes in the movie. I really liked the character of the Ape named Ape and John Cleese I thought gave a good voice performance to the character. I don't think any other actor could of voiced the character better. Filled with good characters, a good story, and hilarious scenes. George of the Jungle is a good movie that anyone can enjoy! I give it 10 out of 10!

And, as I recall from my childhood, George was always a bit dimwitted anyway. So I could deal with the stupidity of the movie and enjoy it for what it was--a child's film with adult undertones. And Brendan Fraser in a loincloth......need I say more?

    I have to say that this film has a lot of dumbness mixed in there with a lot of potential. First, it has a great cast like Holland Taylor as Mrs. Stanhope who you don't see enough of in this film. The animals are largely added in to talk and the elephant acts more like a dog than an elephant. John Cleese is a hoot as the ape who can speak Queen's English and you raised George in the jungle. Anyway, Thomas Haden Church plays Lyle who is with his fianc&eacute; Ursula Stanhope played by Lesley Mann in the jungle but the jungle sets don't look real. Anyway, it's a comedy aimed at a younger audience. Brendan Frasier is fine as George of the jungle but I don't like when he acts like an ape, grunts, or howls. But still there is a sweet love story in there. Abraham Benrubi plays a poacher and the narrator even has a sense of humor too. It's silly childish humor!

    I remember watching this movie as a very small boy and loving it. Years later and nothing has changed. It is full of very funny moments and has a nice story line. It is about the King of the Jungle George (Brandon Frasier) who always crashes in to trees but still is a strong, brave and good hero. He rescues and falls in love with Ursula Stanhope (Leslie Mann) a wealthy American from San Fransisco. However she is engaged to the cowardly and arrogant Lyle who shots and injuries George were he goes to San Fransisco with Ursula to be given treatment. Meanwhile George's brother Ape (John Cleese) is kidnapped by two poachers (Greg Cruttwell and Abraham Benrubi). All of the actors give a great performance. Cleece does a great job as Ape who is a scientific primate brother of George. Frasier does a fantastic job as George whose naive and clumsy behavior is a joy to watch. This is definitely worth watch and I recommend it to all young and old.

    I must say that George of the Jungle is a Pretty Good Movie. I really liked it. Brendan Fraser gave an excellent performance as a man named George who grows up in the jungle after being separated from his family from a plane accident when he was a baby. The rest of the cast give good performances and there are a bunch of hilarious scenes in the movie. I really liked the character of the Ape named Ape and John Cleese I thought gave a good voice performance to the character. I don't think any other actor could of voiced the character better. Filled with good characters, a good story, and hilarious scenes. George of the Jungle is a good movie that anyone can enjoy! I give it 10 out of 10!

    "George of the Jungle" was released in 1997 to moderate critical acclaim, children love the movie, it is very cartoonish. What some people fail to recognize or don't know is that this film is a remake of a 1967 cartoon TV series. John Cleese co-stars as the voice of the "Ape named Ape" which is probably the funniest part of the film. Also, the elephant who acts and thinks he is a dog, Shemp is pure Disney fun. Thomas Haden Church plays the seemingly bad guy Lyle Van de Groot, and Leslie Mann plays Ursula Stanhope, the good girl. They went into the jungle as a couple, but Ursula and George leave together. A love story like Tarzan & Jane!

    The only truly memorable scene in this movie was the stunt at the Golden Gate Bridge-it was actually rather impressive. The rest, however, was trite, dull, and repetitive. George, an inept Tarzan-like man, is found by Ursula in the jungle, and she takes him to the city, and of course there are problems with that. The original "George Of The Jungle" episodes were short cartoons, not necessarily suited for conversion to a feature-length film, as other such efforts such as "Dudley Do-Right" have proved. Though the movie does make a real effort to keep as close to the original cartoon as possible, the sad truth is that the whole thing just didn't work. Fortunately, the fad for such efforts has long died off, so we don't have to worry about seeing Hong Kong Phooey or Tennessee Tuxedo getting such treatment.

    "George of the Jungle" is an earlier example of CGI movies (the jungle images here look fake compared to the ones in present-day movies). The characters are nice enough, and there are some funny moments, but the movie probably won't get many laughs from adults (George crashing into trees gets old quickly because it happens so often, and the bathroom humor is also repeated more than once), and the end of the movie is not surprising considering the plot of the story. For me, the funny parts are where George is having so much trouble adjusting to civilization (making animal calls while riding in the car, not knowing what some common items are because he's never seen them before, not knowing how to interact with other humans). Overall, this is an OK movie but not a great one. Kids will probably laugh at the humor in this movie, but most adults won't find it nearly as funny.

    Brendan Fraser from The Mummy franchise plays George a Tarzan lookalike who's been reared by a gorilla(voiced by John Cleese)and lives in the jungle with the gorillas and apes. Problems arise when he meets Ursula(played by This Is 40 star Leslie Mann)who's engaged to a borish douchbag (played by Thomas Haden Church from Spiderman 3)and he later falls for her. The story maybe a rip off of Tarzan but the over the top humor is hilarious and you gotta love the theme song and the romance between Mann and Fraiser. Im giving it an 8 out of 10.

    I used to watch this as a child and thoroughly enjoyed it back when it came out. I recently watched it again after decades and even though the CG is vastly different from what it is today, it is still an enjoyable movie. The talking monkeys in the movie look very realistic compared to what they would try in this day and age. The narrator in the movie is not annoying as I thought it was going to be as I watched it again as an adult, instead it added to the amusement. I recommend it for parents that like to pass on this movie to their kids. They may not understand some jokes but the majority of it is still understandable. George's antics can make the whole movie for a child. It did for me. It doesn't hurt to look at Brendan Fraser neither!

    This promised to be an entertaining family flick. The ingredients seem just right, talking animals, lady falls in love with a jungle man, fianc&eacute; gets jealous etc. Brendan Fraser pulls of the role reasonably well. John Cleese is well cast as the voice of an ape. However the rest is pulled off terribly. Barring the special effects (which are actually very good), there is little more in this film that might move it up the 'must watch holiday family flick' list. A lot more could and should have been made of this and what little slapstick there is could have been even funnier. the action however is reasonably well choreographed. The problem is that most of it is quite 'reasonable' and not a single element is outstanding.

I recommend it for parents that like to pass on this movie to their kids. They may not understand some jokes but the majority of it is still understandable. George's antics can make the whole movie for a child. It did for me. It doesn't hurt to look at Brendan Fraser neither!

    This promised to be an entertaining family flick. The ingredients seem just right, talking animals, lady falls in love with a jungle man, fianc&eacute; gets jealous etc. Brendan Fraser pulls of the role reasonably well. John Cleese is well cast as the voice of an ape. However the rest is pulled off terribly. Barring the special effects (which are actually very good), there is little more in this film that might move it up the 'must watch holiday family flick' list. A lot more could and should have been made of this and what little slapstick there is could have been even funnier. the action however is reasonably well choreographed. The problem is that most of it is quite 'reasonable' and not a single element is outstanding.

    Those who know me know I HATE stupid comedy. I must admit that I watched this movie simply because B. Fraser starred in it: I have a long-standing crush on the man. I knew, going into it, that it'd be a silly movie with dull humor. Still, I was pleasantly surprised. The humor is dry and stupid most of the time, but the storyline makes up for it. And, as I recall from my childhood, George was always a bit dimwitted anyway. So I could deal with the stupidity of the movie and enjoy it for what it was--a child's film with adult undertones. And Brendan Fraser in a loincloth......need I say more?

    I have to say that this film has a lot of dumbness mixed in there with a lot of potential. First, it has a great cast like Holland Taylor as Mrs. Stanhope who you don't see enough of in this film. The animals are largely added in to talk and the elephant acts more like a dog than an elephant. John Cleese is a hoot as the ape who can speak Queen's English and you raised George in the jungle. Anyway, Thomas Haden Church plays Lyle who is with his fianc&eacute; Ursula Stanhope played by Lesley Mann in the jungle but the jungle sets don't look real. Anyway, it's a comedy aimed at a younger audience. Brendan Frasier is fine as George of the jungle but I don't like when he acts like an ape, grunts, or howls. But still there is a sweet love story in there. Abraham Benrubi plays a poacher and the narrator even has a sense of humor too. It's silly childish humor!

    I remember watching this movie as a very small boy and loving it. Years later and nothing has changed. It is full of very funny moments and has a nice story line. It is about the King of the Jungle George (Brandon Frasier) who always crashes in to trees but still is a strong, brave and good hero. He rescues and falls in love with Ursula Stanhope (Leslie Mann) a wealthy American from San Fransisco. However she is engaged to the cowardly and arrogant Lyle who shots and injuries George were he goes to San Fransisco with Ursula to be given treatment. Meanwhile George's brother Ape (John Cleese) is kidnapped by two poachers (Greg Cruttwell and Abraham Benrubi). All of the actors give a great performance. Cleece does a great job as Ape who is a scientific primate brother of George. Frasier does a fantastic job as George whose naive and clumsy behavior is a joy to watch. This is definitely worth watch and I recommend it to all young and old.

    I must say that George of the Jungle is a Pretty Good Movie. I really liked it. Brendan Fraser gave an excellent performance as a man named George who grows up in the jungle after being separated from his family from a plane accident when he was a baby. The rest of the cast give good performances and there are a bunch of hilarious scenes in the movie. I really liked the character of the Ape named Ape and John Cleese I thought gave a good voice performance to the character. I don't think any other actor could of voiced the character better. Filled with good characters, a good story, and hilarious scenes. George of the Jungle is a good movie that anyone can enjoy! I give it 10 out of 10!

    "George of the Jungle" was released in 1997 to moderate critical acclaim, children love the movie, it is very cartoonish. What some people fail to recognize or don't know is that this film is a remake of a 1967 cartoon TV series. John Cleese co-stars as the voice of the "Ape named Ape" which is probably the funniest part of the film. Also, the elephant who acts and thinks he is a dog, Shemp is pure Disney fun. Thomas Haden Church plays the seemingly bad guy Lyle Van de Groot, and Leslie Mann plays Ursula Stanhope, the good girl. They went into the jungle as a couple, but Ursula and George leave together. A love story like Tarzan & Jane!

    The only truly memorable scene in this movie was the stunt at the Golden Gate Bridge-it was actually rather impressive. The rest, however, was trite, dull, and repetitive. George, an inept Tarzan-like man, is found by Ursula in the jungle, and she takes him to the city, and of course there are problems with that. The original "George Of The Jungle" episodes were short cartoons, not necessarily suited for conversion to a feature-length film, as other such efforts such as "Dudley Do-Right" have proved. Though the movie does make a real effort to keep as close to the original cartoon as possible, the sad truth is that the whole thing just didn't work. Fortunately, the fad for such efforts has long died off, so we don't have to worry about seeing Hong Kong Phooey or Tennessee Tuxedo getting such treatment.

    "George of the Jungle" is an earlier example of CGI movies (the jungle images here look fake compared to the ones in present-day movies). The characters are nice enough, and there are some funny moments, but the movie probably won't get many laughs from adults (George crashing into trees gets old quickly because it happens so often, and the bathroom humor is also repeated more than once), and the end of the movie is not surprising considering the plot of the story. For me, the funny parts are where George is having so much trouble adjusting to civilization (making animal calls while riding in the car, not knowing what some common items are because he's never seen them before, not knowing how to interact with other humans). Overall, this is an OK movie but not a great one. Kids will probably laugh at the humor in this movie, but most adults won't find it nearly as funny.

    Brendan Fraser from The Mummy franchise plays George a Tarzan lookalike who's been reared by a gorilla(voiced by John Cleese)and lives in the jungle with the gorillas and apes. Problems arise when he meets Ursula(played by This Is 40 star Leslie Mann)who's engaged to a borish douchbag (played by Thomas Haden Church from Spiderman 3)and he later falls for her. The story maybe a rip off of Tarzan but the over the top humor is hilarious and you gotta love the theme song and the romance between Mann and Fraiser. Im giving it an 8 out of 10.

Overall, this is an OK movie but not a great one. Kids will probably laugh at the humor in this movie, but most adults won't find it nearly as funny.

    Brendan Fraser from The Mummy franchise plays George a Tarzan lookalike who's been reared by a gorilla(voiced by John Cleese)and lives in the jungle with the gorillas and apes. Problems arise when he meets Ursula(played by This Is 40 star Leslie Mann)who's engaged to a borish douchbag (played by Thomas Haden Church from Spiderman 3)and he later falls for her. The story maybe a rip off of Tarzan but the over the top humor is hilarious and you gotta love the theme song and the romance between Mann and Fraiser. Im giving it an 8 out of 10.

    I used to watch this as a child and thoroughly enjoyed it back when it came out. I recently watched it again after decades and even though the CG is vastly different from what it is today, it is still an enjoyable movie. The talking monkeys in the movie look very realistic compared to what they would try in this day and age. The narrator in the movie is not annoying as I thought it was going to be as I watched it again as an adult, instead it added to the amusement. I recommend it for parents that like to pass on this movie to their kids. They may not understand some jokes but the majority of it is still understandable. George's antics can make the whole movie for a child. It did for me. It doesn't hurt to look at Brendan Fraser neither!

    This promised to be an entertaining family flick. The ingredients seem just right, talking animals, lady falls in love with a jungle man, fianc&eacute; gets jealous etc. Brendan Fraser pulls of the role reasonably well. John Cleese is well cast as the voice of an ape. However the rest is pulled off terribly. Barring the special effects (which are actually very good), there is little more in this film that might move it up the 'must watch holiday family flick' list. A lot more could and should have been made of this and what little slapstick there is could have been even funnier. the action however is reasonably well choreographed. The problem is that most of it is quite 'reasonable' and not a single element is outstanding.

    Those who know me know I HATE stupid comedy. I must admit that I watched this movie simply because B. Fraser starred in it: I have a long-standing crush on the man. I knew, going into it, that it'd be a silly movie with dull humor. Still, I was pleasantly surprised. The humor is dry and stupid most of the time, but the storyline makes up for it. And, as I recall from my childhood, George was always a bit dimwitted anyway. So I could deal with the stupidity of the movie and enjoy it for what it was--a child's film with adult undertones. And Brendan Fraser in a loincloth......need I say more?

    I have to say that this film has a lot of dumbness mixed in there with a lot of potential. First, it has a great cast like Holland Taylor as Mrs. Stanhope who you don't see enough of in this film. The animals are largely added in to talk and the elephant acts more like a dog than an elephant. John Cleese is a hoot as the ape who can speak Queen's English and you raised George in the jungle. Anyway, Thomas Haden Church plays Lyle who is with his fianc&eacute; Ursula Stanhope played by Lesley Mann in the jungle but the jungle sets don't look real. Anyway, it's a comedy aimed at a younger audience. Brendan Frasier is fine as George of the jungle but I don't like when he acts like an ape, grunts, or howls. But still there is a sweet love story in there. Abraham Benrubi plays a poacher and the narrator even has a sense of humor too. It's silly childish humor!

    I remember watching this movie as a very small boy and loving it. Years later and nothing has changed. It is full of very funny moments and has a nice story line. It is about the King of the Jungle George (Brandon Frasier) who always crashes in to trees but still is a strong, brave and good hero. He rescues and falls in love with Ursula Stanhope (Leslie Mann) a wealthy American from San Fransisco. However she is engaged to the cowardly and arrogant Lyle who shots and injuries George were he goes to San Fransisco with Ursula to be given treatment. Meanwhile George's brother Ape (John Cleese) is kidnapped by two poachers (Greg Cruttwell and Abraham Benrubi). All of the actors give a great performance. Cleece does a great job as Ape who is a scientific primate brother of George. Frasier does a fantastic job as George whose naive and clumsy behavior is a joy to watch. This is definitely worth watch and I recommend it to all young and old.

    I must say that George of the Jungle is a Pretty Good Movie. I really liked it. Brendan Fraser gave an excellent performance as a man named George who grows up in the jungle after being separated from his family from a plane accident when he was a baby. The rest of the cast give good performances and there are a bunch of hilarious scenes in the movie. I really liked the character of the Ape named Ape and John Cleese I thought gave a good voice performance to the character. I don't think any other actor could of voiced the character better. Filled with good characters, a good story, and hilarious scenes. George of the Jungle is a good movie that anyone can enjoy! I give it 10 out of 10!

    "George of the Jungle" was released in 1997 to moderate critical acclaim, children love the movie, it is very cartoonish. What some people fail to recognize or don't know is that this film is a remake of a 1967 cartoon TV series. John Cleese co-stars as the voice of the "Ape named Ape" which is probably the funniest part of the film. Also, the elephant who acts and thinks he is a dog, Shemp is pure Disney fun. Thomas Haden Church plays the seemingly bad guy Lyle Van de Groot, and Leslie Mann plays Ursula Stanhope, the good girl. They went into the jungle as a couple, but Ursula and George leave together. A love story like Tarzan & Jane!

    The only truly memorable scene in this movie was the stunt at the Golden Gate Bridge-it was actually rather impressive. The rest, however, was trite, dull, and repetitive. George, an inept Tarzan-like man, is found by Ursula in the jungle, and she takes him to the city, and of course there are problems with that. The original "George Of The Jungle" episodes were short cartoons, not necessarily suited for conversion to a feature-length film, as other such efforts such as "Dudley Do-Right" have proved. Though the movie does make a real effort to keep as close to the original cartoon as possible, the sad truth is that the whole thing just didn't work. Fortunately, the fad for such efforts has long died off, so we don't have to worry about seeing Hong Kong Phooey or Tennessee Tuxedo getting such treatment.

    "George of the Jungle" is an earlier example of CGI movies (the jungle images here look fake compared to the ones in present-day movies). The characters are nice enough, and there are some funny moments, but the movie probably won't get many laughs from adults (George crashing into trees gets old quickly because it happens so often, and the bathroom humor is also repeated more than once), and the end of the movie is not surprising considering the plot of the story. For me, the funny parts are where George is having so much trouble adjusting to civilization (making animal calls while riding in the car, not knowing what some common items are because he's never seen them before, not knowing how to interact with other humans).
