 <sinopse>
  A man in a legal but hurtful business needs an escort for some social events, and hires a beautiful prostitute he meets... only to fall in love.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Edward is a rich, ruthless businessman who specializes in taking over companies and then selling them off piece by piece. He travels to Los Angeles for a business trip and decides to hire a prostitute. They take a liking to each other and he offers her money if she'll stay with him for an entire week while he makes the "rich and famous" scene (since it doesn't do for a man of his stature to be alone at society parties and polo matches). Romantic comedy (and complications) ensue.

    Calling this movie a romance is pretty much a disgrace. Let's not forget something. The heroine is a hooker! The hooker with the heart of gold! Please! I don't buy at all that Richard Gere, as a millionaire or even a $40,000 a year salesman, would fall in love with the hooker, Julia Roberts. First of all, Julia Roberts isn't all that hot. It's hard to even call her "pretty", the first word in the tittle of the movie. She's not ugly, but she's just a little above average, bordering on pretty. That aside, stud millionaires do not fall in love with hookers. They might pay one from time to time, but they don't fall in love them. The whole premise of this movie is idiotic, so the movie is unsuccessful to me as a whole. All that aside, Gere was very good in the film, and Roberts acting was also very good. The movie had outstanding production value and certain characters, like the one played by Jason Alexander, were interesting. So, as a total score, I give Pretty Woman a five.

    This is from Roy Orbinson 1964's hit song that reached its cinematic posterity 26 years later, with Garry Marshall's film of the same name. Oddly enough, when taken in the context of the film, the lyrics take a totally different significance since the titular 'pretty woman' doesn't quite walk on the streets for pleasure. Of course, the song is used for the film's trademark sequence when Vivian tries new clothes from prestigious French sounding shops, fulfilling every little girl's fantasy. But there's something genuinely appealing in Julia Robert's performance, a sort of child-like eagerness to embrace a one-week dream and do whatever she wants because she got woman's most cherished accessory, not a handbag, not a lipstick or a mirror, but a credit card. Don't take that statement as patronizing and misogynistic please, "Sex and the City" convey the same message, and bluntly assumes it. What differentiates Vivian from the other feminist icons though relies on the roots of her constant enthusiasm, forever incarnated by Robert's unique smile  and irresistible giggles. Indeed, no matter how much fun she has while seizing her luxurious days, we know that she's happy, more than anything, because she's in love. And the man might be rich, handsome and powerful, like a modernization of the 'Charming Prince' figure, there's something that oddly rings true in that peculiar love story. And this is a credit to two fine performances from Julia Roberts and Richard Gere, and a clever screenplay that doesn't take its premise for granted, starting from the obligatory meeting, which is the hit-or-miss of romantic comedies. Gere is Edward Lewis, he can't drive a friend's car and find his way to the hotel, he meets a prostitute named Vivian, she's not only attractive, but she's smart. She knows about car and end up driving him to the hotel. So, when he invites for just one night, that will turns into one week, plot-wise, the machine is working. "I want the fairy tale" she admits later, with an innocence that sweeps off all the dirt that has tarnished her life since she started walking on the streets. Never in the film, had she felt more sincere and more naively appealing. All little girls want the fairy tale, and that quote, if one thing, highlights the fact there still is that 'little girl' sparkle in Vivian's eyes, and her profession is only a logical consequence to unfortunate circumstances. But the film doesn't fall in the patronizing trap either, Vivian needs Edwards, but so does he. There's a clever parallel established by these two people's jobs, Edward buys out companies facing economic difficulties, to sell parts of them and make more profits. As she says, both screw people for money, and Edward is no more honorable than Vivian. Both hearts reflect the other's truth, that's the mark of true love and that's exactly what happens to Edward and Vivian. There's a nice subplot involving one company Edward doesn't want to buy because he likes its chairman, who's a sort of fatherly figure, wonderfully played by Ralph Bellamy, and it's only after his experience with Vivian that he realizes he doesn't enjoy his job as she did and might have chosen the wrong path for some obscure Oedipal reasons. Vivian, didn't embrace her career with more passion either, but maybe she kept on hoping of a real love, one that would be incarnated by the only thing she couldn't give her customers: a kiss. And the pay-off comes when she tenderly kisses a sleeping Edward in the mouth, at that point, we know she loves him. "Pretty Woman" doesn't overplay the whole Pygmalion-theme, that one is handled by Hector Elizondo, the hotel manager who, from despising Vivian, grows fond on her and teaches her how to properly behave. But the film doesn't use their archetypes for the sake of cheap laughs, it doesn't need to, Roberts is hilarious because she stays natural in a world she doesn't belong to, and never condescending either, Edward is inspired by her spontaneity, something that cruelly lacks in his work of sophistication and cynical materialism, incarnated by his friend and lawyer, played by Joe Constanza. Constanza, as the only true antagonist of the film, is responsible of one of the film's saddest parts, after Gere comforted him that Vivian wasn't a spy. After being approached like a cheap prostitute, you could feel she was truly hurt by Edward's betrayal. And this is what the film is about, two persons who don't want to be reduced to condescending label, one in the highest, and another in the lowest extreme. Being treated like a prostitute is the ultimate insult for Vivian because it totally negates her struggle to let her personality finally bloom, as Edward knows he's not that rich prick who only thinks in green bills. It's all about becoming yourself. I don't intend to make the film sound like an existential journey; it's still a heart-warming comedy but more intelligent and subtle than any comedy made today. And I'm sure in retrospect; many critics who despised the films would feel guilty for having labeled "Pretty Woman" too straightforwardly as a banal and commercial romantic comedy. Rom-com, chick-flick, Cinderella story, feel-good story  cinematic jargon is rich of epithets to describe Garry Marshall's "Pretty Woman". Yet these words are too convenient and tend to veil the true poignancy and endearing chemistry between the two leads. Yes, we have the rich workaholic businessman with a disastrous sentimental life, meeting the streetwise hooker, with a heart of gold, but when played by Richard Gere and Julia Roberts whose shining smile illuminates the screen like a lamppost in Hollywood Boulevard, the film turns out to far better than some cynical minds might expect. At the end, I was left wondering: aren't the so-called stereotypes the names we give to obligatory plot devices when they're wrongly handled?

    I must admit that I find this movie one of the most offensive ever to come out of Hollywood. I can suspend disbelief, but this is ridiculous. Perhaps it is because I know too much about how this movie started, have lived in Hollywood myself and seen many documentaries on the real lives of prostitutes. The original script was intended as a very dark, cautionary tale about class warfare and prostitution in the Los Angeles area. It was then completely revamped as a high budget romantic comedy. As a result, it became one of the most successful box office movies of all time. First, while there are probably many handsome johns - they rarely are as good looking as Edward (Richard Gere). Nor are they as respectful. Well, maybe on one of those sugar baby websites. But that's different than picking up some random dude on the street like Vivian (Julia Roberts) did. After their first sexual encounter, Edward hires Vivian for the week to "escort" him to social events. So she's giving it up for a whole week for 3K? Maybe that was the going rate in 1990. He also gives her access to his credit cards. I suppose that could make up for it -- and maybe there are some guys who have done that before. Seems like a stupid move to trust a woman who takes sex for money. She could run those things up in no time, especially in a ridiculously expensive town like L.A. Vivian gets snubbed on Rodeo Drive. Well, that's believable, because anyone without their nose in the air gets snubbed there - street whore or not. But being snubbed at the hotel makes no sense. Many of those hotels make their living with high end prostitutes. Or at least bimbos who look like they are. Go to any fancy hotel and you will see decked out babes. Doesn't mean they're all whores -- but many of them look like they could be. I once found out in Vegas that many women who dressed up there were hookers. And I had a classy dress that revealed nothing - in fact, it wasn't even tight. So we are supposed to believe that Vivian isn't capable of buying a dress or using utensils at the dinner table? Sorry, she is not street enough to believe that. She looks like some chick who ran away from Nebraska - not a down and dirty Hollywood whore. Or course, Heidi Fleiss had a stable of classy looking chicks. But that's the point - a woman who looks like Roberts is usually part of a service, not someone hanging out on the street. I've heard that many johns like to tell their secrets and bare their souls to whores. So when Mr. Nice Guy reveals that he was estranged from his now dead father that could make sense. Because poor little Vivian was snubbed at the store, Edward comes to the rescue and takes her shopping. I think the most dangerous thing about this film is that even though it is rated R, plenty of young girls have seen it. Glamorizing prostitution in any way is irresponsible. Some prostitutes may have married one of her johns. But that's something that happens less than the chance of winning the lotto. Prostitution will always exist, but let's not make it out to be something it isn't. Sure, there are probably some happy hookers out there - but I've not met or heard of a single one. The truth is that most of the people I've seen or known of who have sex for money came from abuse, are on drugs or have very low self esteem. This whole movie is so phony and full of lies -- not even the ad is real. They used a body double because little miss goodie two shoes herself -- Julia Roberts - while willing to play a street hooker - not only refused to do nude scenes, but the movie poster legs aren't hers, either. Or maybe she didn't look as good in the photo. I rest my case -- this movie is just a disgrace. I will agree that it deserved to be nominated for an Oscar and win some awards -- because so many movies are contrived, complete and utter nonsense.

    Rom-coms are, generally speaking, not a great genre favourite of mine. It may be a tricky balance by having to have both comedy and romantic elements but there are a dozen examples I could name that fail on either one or both counts - "The Accidental Husband", "27 Dresses", "Fifty First Dates", "Never Been Kissed", "Bridget Jones: The Edge Of Reason" and so on. Being married, it is almost inevitable that I will watch a romantic comedy at some point but occasionally, she picks an absolute corker and I'm delighted to add this movie onto the 'good' pile. It might not be a realistic picture in any meaningful sense but as a pantomime, this is as good as it gets. Richard Gere plays corporate shark Edward Lewis, hugely rich and successful and visiting LA to seal his latest acquisition. His personal life, however, is a mess and after borrowing his lawyer-friend Philip Stuckey's (Jason Alexander) Lotus and getting lost in Beverly Hills, he meets hooker Vivian (Julia Roberts) and asks her for directions. Thus begins an unusual arrangement where Vivian agrees to spend the week as Edward's escort for $3000. While Edward struggles with his increasing attraction to Vivian, she struggles for acceptance amid the high-society she now finds herself in. Despite being a pumpkin short of being a straight-up adaptation of "Cinderella", "Pretty Woman" is an unashamed romantic flight of fancy fuelled by conversations about nothing in particular and long stares full of meaning. As a fable, it is a winner but as a serious character study, the film is found wanting. Roberts never convinces as a prostitute at any point in the film, looking far too clean-cut and well-fed although she has plenty of sass and her biting back at the snobs around her is quite amusing as are her scenes with Hector Elizondo's hotel manager. Gere, for his part, has little to do but seem distant but available which is exactly what he is. But we never seem to find out why he is the way he is other than being focused on his career. Instead, we get snippets of personality such as the scene at the piano but nothing to explain why he likes playing it to complete strangers. It's maddeningly short when it comes to the details but then you remind yourself (and indeed, the movie itself does) that this is "Cinderella" and like all fairy tales, they don't bear up to well to things like plot scrutiny. I never heard anyone voice the suggestion that Cinderella is the only person in the land with that particular shoe size... So this is one of those rare films where I can forgive the faults and just enjoy the damn thing. It isn't perfect - Roberts just isn't the right actress for the part and Gere needs a serious charisma transplant - but because it's a winning story, you can sit back and go with the flow. Whether its the romance with real chemistry from the leads or the battle-of-the-classes subplot, you buy into it in a way that most rom-coms can only dream of. Certainly my Better Half had that look on her face that said "Go on, girl!" during certain scenes, although she prefers "Dirty Dancing". I can see where she's coming from - that too has problems at its heart but the soundtrack just about rescues that film for me personally. This is much more enjoyable but whatever you do, don't take it seriously and don't question the plot too much.

    "Fifty bucks, Grandpa. For seventy-five, the wife can watch." - Kit I could write this review in the dark. I've seen Pretty Woman so many times, I cannot count. I take that back: I can count how many timesI saw it in the theatre. Back in Summer 1990  yes, months after this opened, I saw it for the first time, in an empty theatre, during an afternoon weekday. I didn't want to see it, but everyone including my beloved Aunt recommended it over and over. And over. And over. So, I caved. Six more viewings, including the last 2 on the same day, and I have had a record for me for one single movie unbroken since 1990. Yes, I saw Pretty Woman 7 times in the movie theatres. Obviously, I loved it back then. And still do. It's always like an old friend when I revisit this, albeit, one I can quote word for word, but still. Granted the movie's one singular flaw is that it's not the most original concept. For that, on my personal scientific scale of rating movies, it lost one single point bringing the overall score to 99/100. Rarely, on my list, will any movie even get above 95/100, let alone 99/100and only one got to 100/100. So, when I even state the word "flaw," I mean in the absolute smallest of ways. And besides, they address this with that one funny line: "What, you want me to name someone? You want like a name? Oh, God, the pressure of a name... I got it. Cindafuckin'rella!"  Kit Actually, come to think of it, there's dozens of funny lines, motions, scenes. I laugh as hard as I cry during each viewing. This movie is absolutely brilliant from beginning to end with its perfect balance of drama, comedy and romance. Emotionally beaten down Vivian (Julia Roberts  in a role that propelled her into space) had just recently begun streetwalking when she's picked up, initially for directions, by &uuml;ber-rich Edward Lewis (Richard Gere in a masterful performance) on Hollywood Boulevard. When it's realized she's a hooker with a heart and he's a hopeless romantic, they slowly begin a relationship, despite her being requested, um paid, to be at his "beck and call" for the remainder of his business trip in L.A. Of course, things are going to get complicated as roles are defined, and others have been thrown into the mix, but these two actors were so incredibly believable, so real and had so many genuine reactions and improved lines/scenes, you will fall hard for their romance. I've wanted to write this review of one of my all time favorite movies for quite some time. Sadly, I do not think, even with the countless (home) viewings, that I will do this movie justice. I will just say what's on my mind, and always on my mind when I see this: Fantastic lines, great pacing, deep romance, believable faces, one of the best soundtracks ever, also great score, real and fun. From beginning to end, I get involved and not just because I've seen it before; it's just a journey I love to get involved in and always pretend it's my first time. So much so, that I literally smile wide (like the absolutely stunning Roberts in this) when a scene comes up I didn't allow myself to recall. This has been, is and always will be one of my all-time favorite movies. It thoroughly improved on the old Cinderella story one-hundred times. And this version is absolutely timeless. Side Note: As mentioned above, I've seen this movie 7 times in the theatre and the last 2 of those, on the same day. Just to explain, I had the day off of school, and was to meet my friends at the now-defunct Valley West Mall's dollar theatre. Actually, it was Tuesday's 50 cent day. So, while waiting on my friends, who did not have the day off, I decided on seeing Pretty Woman for the sixth and final time during the early afternoon. Little did I know, they, too, wanted to see it, so I went to go with them to the same theatre screen, the same day, to see Pretty Woman a seventh time. Side Note II: Since I am a huge Superman fan, I wanted to break this 7x in the theatre record in 2006 with Superman Returns. Sadly, as much as I liked that movie (and wanted to more) I could only make it to 5 viewings. Here's to 2013's Man of Steel. I am going to try and break the record once more!

    Pretty Woman is a decent movie with a pretty simple,clich&eacute; story line,but there is a good cast.The movie is a chick flick,but they usually have some kind of conflict,Pretty Woman is just two hours of Richard Gere and Julia Roberts going to different places with each other and showing off how in love they are,although I did think both these actors gave their best to this simple,plain movie,and they definitely had good chemistry on set,and if it wasn't for their impressive acting,I would be giving this movie a much lower rating than 6. Edward Lewis (Richard Gere) falls in love with a prostitute (Julia Roberts) he meets at Beverly Hills and begins spoiling her with his wealth.

    watching this movie at night,pretty woman gives me some thinking and surprise.it is about personality.the compare between cold thinking and warm heart.a good movie. Roberts is sweet,the changing of her emotion in this film is the main topic.no matter happy or sorrow,it is all about falling in love.this film is better than dying young,the changing is more interesting,but the main actor is not handsome than the main actor in dying young though he is more reasonable.Roberts somehow always gives person kind of happy feeling,not sad.especially when she smiles.i will watch her other movies when i am free from doing my job.though she is getting old now .

    To maintain their wholesome image, Walt Disney Studios released "Pretty Woman" under the umbrella of their ancillary company, Touchstone Pictures. But "Pretty Woman", a feature film about a prostitute who turns into a princess after meeting a Californian prince, is no more sleazy than Disney's animated films aimed at children. The message, values and narrative arcs are all the same. The plot? Richard Gere plays a millionaire who's depressed because "his father doesn't love him". Disillusioned, he prepares to dismantle and downsize his giant corporate empire. Luckily he meets a hooker played by Julia Roberts. He showers her in money, riches and fine clothes, she teaches him to be a kind, good businessman who "provides jobs to shipbuilders". She rescues him from depression and "bad" capitalism, he rescues her from the slums, prostitution and, ergo, "bad" capitalism. The couple no longer screw people over, be it as prostitutes or as corporate raiders, but engage in "moral transactions". They get married, live happily ever after and he builds warships. Like "Indecent Proposal", released around the same time, the super-wealthy are initially malevolent but reveal themselves to be caring and decent. Prostitution is good, clean, profitable, fun and "just another career choice". Women, as prostitutes, make their own decisions and are entirely independent, strong and in control of their bodies and choices. Softcore titillation is used, and the prevailing aesthetic is one which bows down to wealth, riches, materialism and money. The end goal is always monogamous marital bliss, women gladly debase themselves to be with their wealthy providers and love conquers all difficulties and is constant. Furthermore, super-rich princes are the male ideal and hookers with hearts of gold are the female ideal. Prostitution has no serious consequences, prostitution is glorified and takes place between free women and sensitive guys, and monogamous marriage, capitalism, patriarchy, and commodification are all endorsed. Elsewhere expensive finery masks amorality, men mould women into their own little dolls, corruption is unimportant (because everyone is corrupt, everyone's a whore, and so corruption is relative), corporate raiders care about people other than themselves (members from the urban poor, no less) and disparages in wealth, taste, experience and education are both cute and don't thwart romance. Compare this to Francois Truffaut's "The Soft Skin", where the provincial mannerisms of a similar woman are mocked by her aristocratic lover. To make the film work, Big Business must be glorified as much as prostitution. Gere's a Prince Charming, climbing towers to rescue his lady. Oddly, the film is adored by women. It very much represents a post-feminist stance; as all female desire is celebrated, the fantasy of winning a rich prince is super cool, even if this first means that a woman must first unconsciously self-identify as a "whore". Servitute is embraced because the self is redefined as feminine-consumer, allowed to window-shop for any and all desires, which in this case is implicitly connected to women's magazines, the fashion industry and the disciplined use of makeup, clothing, exercise etc. Everyone can be transformed from working girl to lady of leisure, everyone is allowed to dream of being valuable and feel valued, everyone is trained in the art of seduction, self-marketing, sexual gratification and consumer display. 4/10 - "My Fair Lady" meets "Cinderella" meets "Pygmalion". Worth one viewing.

    I like Julia Roberts but this was such a step backward for women. Come on seriously how could anyone think of this as a romance?? There were so many clich&eacute;s in this movie I began to wonder if it was just one big commercial for male body spray like Axe. Where could a relationship like this go? They going to have children? Hey Mom how did you and Dad meet? Oh I was hooking down on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and your Dad gave me $100 to spend the night with him. Isn't that sooo romantic. Blech! Imagine every time they get into an argument and he tells her she is just hooker anyway and should be happy with what she's got. Although, this film was made in the 90's it must have been written in the 50's back when men had some crazy control issues and wished they could just keep women down...oh wait a minute how much has really changed since then? This film is less of a Cinderella story for hookers and more of a Cinderfella story for "Johns".

    "Pretty Woman" is a lightweight but entertaining fairy tale about Prince Charming. Everything about director Garry Marshall's upbeat romantic comedy is as contrived as it is sugar coated from subversion of any sort. Although it received an R rating, this sappy two hour plus love story shows what happens to a handsome but heartless Wall Street titan when he encounters a savvy street prostitute in Beverly Hills and how their lives change radically for the better. Despite its predictable plot, "Pretty Woman" wins us over with the chemistry and charisma of the principals. Richard Gere plays protagonist Edward Lewis with wisdom and suavity. He is a businessman who buys companies and then breaks them up and sells them off. Consequently, the milk of human kindness doesn't flow in his blood. Sheer coincidence brings our hero face to face with the heroine, young but gorgeous, and "Pretty Woman" charts their fate together. Reportedly, scenarist J.T. Lawton's original script emphasized gutter realism over utter unreality. Marshall and his writers have sanded off all the rough edges. Our hero is in Los Angles when he discovers that his girlfriend is about to ditch him. He tries to drive a Lotus Esprit and nearly wrecks it. Kit and Vivian are prowling their share of the sidewalk when Edward cruises up and parks. Of course, he hasn't so much parked as jammed his car up so he cannot get it to run. He inquires for directions for Beverley Hills from her. He asks her afterward if she can drive the Lotus. They wind up at his Beverley Hills hotel and Edward buys Vivian for the night and then the week. He shells out thousands of dollars to get Vivian a proper wardrobe so she can accompany him in public and appear presentable. Chiefly, Edward wants to buy out a company that makes ships and sell it off, but the owner-founder, James Morse (Ralph Bellamy of "The Professionals") refuses to bow out without a fight. Edward did not have a good relationship with his own father Carson. Indeed, when Carter died, neither had spoken to each other in 14 and a half years. Initially, Edward savors the process of carving up Morse's company until he begins to see him as a human. Richard Gere and Julia Roberts make Edward and Vivian very palatable, very sexy, and very sympathetic. The happily ever after ending is contrived. Interestingly, the two principals move onto to better things. Ostensibly, Jason Alexander is delivers the best performance as Edward's cutthroat attorney, Philip Stuckey, who has been with him ten years. Philip's abrasive treatment of Vivian alienates Edward and he fires Philip. Hector Elizondo has a memorable supporting role as the hotel manager who helps Vivian with her wardrobe. There isn't a single character in this romantic comedy that has any depth or subtlety. Marshall relies on wardrobe to define his characters and neither the protagonist nor the heroine is ever in jeopardy. The Beverly Hills shopping scene when our heroine returns to Rodeo Driver is amusing. The people who made this diverting epic create characters that you find yourself rooting for and liking and the villains get their comeuppance.

    Calling this movie a romance is pretty much a disgrace. Let's not forget something. The heroine is a hooker! The hooker with the heart of gold! Please! I don't buy at all that Richard Gere, as a millionaire or even a $40,000 a year salesman, would fall in love with the hooker, Julia Roberts. First of all, Julia Roberts isn't all that hot. It's hard to even call her "pretty", the first word in the tittle of the movie. She's not ugly, but she's just a little above average, bordering on pretty. That aside, stud millionaires do not fall in love with hookers. They might pay one from time to time, but they don't fall in love them. The whole premise of this movie is idiotic, so the movie is unsuccessful to me as a whole. All that aside, Gere was very good in the film, and Roberts acting was also very good. The movie had outstanding production value and certain characters, like the one played by Jason Alexander, were interesting. So, as a total score, I give Pretty Woman a five.

    This is from Roy Orbinson 1964's hit song that reached its cinematic posterity 26 years later, with Garry Marshall's film of the same name. Oddly enough, when taken in the context of the film, the lyrics take a totally different significance since the titular 'pretty woman' doesn't quite walk on the streets for pleasure. Of course, the song is used for the film's trademark sequence when Vivian tries new clothes from prestigious French sounding shops, fulfilling every little girl's fantasy. But there's something genuinely appealing in Julia Robert's performance, a sort of child-like eagerness to embrace a one-week dream and do whatever she wants because she got woman's most cherished accessory, not a handbag, not a lipstick or a mirror, but a credit card. Don't take that statement as patronizing and misogynistic please, "Sex and the City" convey the same message, and bluntly assumes it. What differentiates Vivian from the other feminist icons though relies on the roots of her constant enthusiasm, forever incarnated by Robert's unique smile  and irresistible giggles. Indeed, no matter how much fun she has while seizing her luxurious days, we know that she's happy, more than anything, because she's in love. And the man might be rich, handsome and powerful, like a modernization of the 'Charming Prince' figure, there's something that oddly rings true in that peculiar love story. And this is a credit to two fine performances from Julia Roberts and Richard Gere, and a clever screenplay that doesn't take its premise for granted, starting from the obligatory meeting, which is the hit-or-miss of romantic comedies. Gere is Edward Lewis, he can't drive a friend's car and find his way to the hotel, he meets a prostitute named Vivian, she's not only attractive, but she's smart. She knows about car and end up driving him to the hotel. So, when he invites for just one night, that will turns into one week, plot-wise, the machine is working. "I want the fairy tale" she admits later, with an innocence that sweeps off all the dirt that has tarnished her life since she started walking on the streets. Never in the film, had she felt more sincere and more naively appealing. All little girls want the fairy tale, and that quote, if one thing, highlights the fact there still is that 'little girl' sparkle in Vivian's eyes, and her profession is only a logical consequence to unfortunate circumstances. But the film doesn't fall in the patronizing trap either, Vivian needs Edwards, but so does he. There's a clever parallel established by these two people's jobs, Edward buys out companies facing economic difficulties, to sell parts of them and make more profits. As she says, both screw people for money, and Edward is no more honorable than Vivian. Both hearts reflect the other's truth, that's the mark of true love and that's exactly what happens to Edward and Vivian. There's a nice subplot involving one company Edward doesn't want to buy because he likes its chairman, who's a sort of fatherly figure, wonderfully played by Ralph Bellamy, and it's only after his experience with Vivian that he realizes he doesn't enjoy his job as she did and might have chosen the wrong path for some obscure Oedipal reasons. Vivian, didn't embrace her career with more passion either, but maybe she kept on hoping of a real love, one that would be incarnated by the only thing she couldn't give her customers: a kiss. And the pay-off comes when she tenderly kisses a sleeping Edward in the mouth, at that point, we know she loves him. "Pretty Woman" doesn't overplay the whole Pygmalion-theme, that one is handled by Hector Elizondo, the hotel manager who, from despising Vivian, grows fond on her and teaches her how to properly behave. But the film doesn't use their archetypes for the sake of cheap laughs, it doesn't need to, Roberts is hilarious because she stays natural in a world she doesn't belong to, and never condescending either, Edward is inspired by her spontaneity, something that cruelly lacks in his work of sophistication and cynical materialism, incarnated by his friend and lawyer, played by Joe Constanza. Constanza, as the only true antagonist of the film, is responsible of one of the film's saddest parts, after Gere comforted him that Vivian wasn't a spy. After being approached like a cheap prostitute, you could feel she was truly hurt by Edward's betrayal. And this is what the film is about, two persons who don't want to be reduced to condescending label, one in the highest, and another in the lowest extreme. Being treated like a prostitute is the ultimate insult for Vivian because it totally negates her struggle to let her personality finally bloom, as Edward knows he's not that rich prick who only thinks in green bills. It's all about becoming yourself. I don't intend to make the film sound like an existential journey; it's still a heart-warming comedy but more intelligent and subtle than any comedy made today. And I'm sure in retrospect; many critics who despised the films would feel guilty for having labeled "Pretty Woman" too straightforwardly as a banal and commercial romantic comedy. Rom-com, chick-flick, Cinderella story, feel-good story  cinematic jargon is rich of epithets to describe Garry Marshall's "Pretty Woman". Yet these words are too convenient and tend to veil the true poignancy and endearing chemistry between the two leads. Yes, we have the rich workaholic businessman with a disastrous sentimental life, meeting the streetwise hooker, with a heart of gold, but when played by Richard Gere and Julia Roberts whose shining smile illuminates the screen like a lamppost in Hollywood Boulevard, the film turns out to far better than some cynical minds might expect. At the end, I was left wondering: aren't the so-called stereotypes the names we give to obligatory plot devices when they're wrongly handled?

    I must admit that I find this movie one of the most offensive ever to come out of Hollywood. I can suspend disbelief, but this is ridiculous. Perhaps it is because I know too much about how this movie started, have lived in Hollywood myself and seen many documentaries on the real lives of prostitutes. The original script was intended as a very dark, cautionary tale about class warfare and prostitution in the Los Angeles area. It was then completely revamped as a high budget romantic comedy. As a result, it became one of the most successful box office movies of all time. First, while there are probably many handsome johns - they rarely are as good looking as Edward (Richard Gere). Nor are they as respectful. Well, maybe on one of those sugar baby websites. But that's different than picking up some random dude on the street like Vivian (Julia Roberts) did. After their first sexual encounter, Edward hires Vivian for the week to "escort" him to social events. So she's giving it up for a whole week for 3K? Maybe that was the going rate in 1990. He also gives her access to his credit cards. I suppose that could make up for it -- and maybe there are some guys who have done that before. Seems like a stupid move to trust a woman who takes sex for money. She could run those things up in no time, especially in a ridiculously expensive town like L.A. Vivian gets snubbed on Rodeo Drive. Well, that's believable, because anyone without their nose in the air gets snubbed there - street whore or not. But being snubbed at the hotel makes no sense. Many of those hotels make their living with high end prostitutes. Or at least bimbos who look like they are. Go to any fancy hotel and you will see decked out babes. Doesn't mean they're all whores -- but many of them look like they could be. I once found out in Vegas that many women who dressed up there were hookers. And I had a classy dress that revealed nothing - in fact, it wasn't even tight. So we are supposed to believe that Vivian isn't capable of buying a dress or using utensils at the dinner table? Sorry, she is not street enough to believe that. She looks like some chick who ran away from Nebraska - not a down and dirty Hollywood whore. Or course, Heidi Fleiss had a stable of classy looking chicks. But that's the point - a woman who looks like Roberts is usually part of a service, not someone hanging out on the street. I've heard that many johns like to tell their secrets and bare their souls to whores. So when Mr. Nice Guy reveals that he was estranged from his now dead father that could make sense. Because poor little Vivian was snubbed at the store, Edward comes to the rescue and takes her shopping. I think the most dangerous thing about this film is that even though it is rated R, plenty of young girls have seen it. Glamorizing prostitution in any way is irresponsible. Some prostitutes may have married one of her johns. But that's something that happens less than the chance of winning the lotto. Prostitution will always exist, but let's not make it out to be something it isn't. Sure, there are probably some happy hookers out there - but I've not met or heard of a single one. The truth is that most of the people I've seen or known of who have sex for money came from abuse, are on drugs or have very low self esteem. This whole movie is so phony and full of lies -- not even the ad is real. They used a body double because little miss goodie two shoes herself -- Julia Roberts - while willing to play a street hooker - not only refused to do nude scenes, but the movie poster legs aren't hers, either. Or maybe she didn't look as good in the photo. I rest my case -- this movie is just a disgrace. I will agree that it deserved to be nominated for an Oscar and win some awards -- because so many movies are contrived, complete and utter nonsense.

    Rom-coms are, generally speaking, not a great genre favourite of mine. It may be a tricky balance by having to have both comedy and romantic elements but there are a dozen examples I could name that fail on either one or both counts - "The Accidental Husband", "27 Dresses", "Fifty First Dates", "Never Been Kissed", "Bridget Jones: The Edge Of Reason" and so on. Being married, it is almost inevitable that I will watch a romantic comedy at some point but occasionally, she picks an absolute corker and I'm delighted to add this movie onto the 'good' pile. It might not be a realistic picture in any meaningful sense but as a pantomime, this is as good as it gets. Richard Gere plays corporate shark Edward Lewis, hugely rich and successful and visiting LA to seal his latest acquisition. His personal life, however, is a mess and after borrowing his lawyer-friend Philip Stuckey's (Jason Alexander) Lotus and getting lost in Beverly Hills, he meets hooker Vivian (Julia Roberts) and asks her for directions. Thus begins an unusual arrangement where Vivian agrees to spend the week as Edward's escort for $3000. While Edward struggles with his increasing attraction to Vivian, she struggles for acceptance amid the high-society she now finds herself in. Despite being a pumpkin short of being a straight-up adaptation of "Cinderella", "Pretty Woman" is an unashamed romantic flight of fancy fuelled by conversations about nothing in particular and long stares full of meaning. As a fable, it is a winner but as a serious character study, the film is found wanting. Roberts never convinces as a prostitute at any point in the film, looking far too clean-cut and well-fed although she has plenty of sass and her biting back at the snobs around her is quite amusing as are her scenes with Hector Elizondo's hotel manager. Gere, for his part, has little to do but seem distant but available which is exactly what he is. But we never seem to find out why he is the way he is other than being focused on his career. Instead, we get snippets of personality such as the scene at the piano but nothing to explain why he likes playing it to complete strangers. It's maddeningly short when it comes to the details but then you remind yourself (and indeed, the movie itself does) that this is "Cinderella" and like all fairy tales, they don't bear up to well to things like plot scrutiny. I never heard anyone voice the suggestion that Cinderella is the only person in the land with that particular shoe size... So this is one of those rare films where I can forgive the faults and just enjoy the damn thing. It isn't perfect - Roberts just isn't the right actress for the part and Gere needs a serious charisma transplant - but because it's a winning story, you can sit back and go with the flow. Whether its the romance with real chemistry from the leads or the battle-of-the-classes subplot, you buy into it in a way that most rom-coms can only dream of. Certainly my Better Half had that look on her face that said "Go on, girl!" during certain scenes, although she prefers "Dirty Dancing". I can see where she's coming from - that too has problems at its heart but the soundtrack just about rescues that film for me personally. This is much more enjoyable but whatever you do, don't take it seriously and don't question the plot too much.

    "Fifty bucks, Grandpa. For seventy-five, the wife can watch." - Kit I could write this review in the dark. I've seen Pretty Woman so many times, I cannot count. I take that back: I can count how many timesI saw it in the theatre. Back in Summer 1990  yes, months after this opened, I saw it for the first time, in an empty theatre, during an afternoon weekday. I didn't want to see it, but everyone including my beloved Aunt recommended it over and over. And over. And over. So, I caved. Six more viewings, including the last 2 on the same day, and I have had a record for me for one single movie unbroken since 1990. Yes, I saw Pretty Woman 7 times in the movie theatres. Obviously, I loved it back then. And still do. It's always like an old friend when I revisit this, albeit, one I can quote word for word, but still. Granted the movie's one singular flaw is that it's not the most original concept. For that, on my personal scientific scale of rating movies, it lost one single point bringing the overall score to 99/100. Rarely, on my list, will any movie even get above 95/100, let alone 99/100and only one got to 100/100. So, when I even state the word "flaw," I mean in the absolute smallest of ways. And besides, they address this with that one funny line: "What, you want me to name someone? You want like a name? Oh, God, the pressure of a name... I got it. Cindafuckin'rella!"  Kit Actually, come to think of it, there's dozens of funny lines, motions, scenes. I laugh as hard as I cry during each viewing. This movie is absolutely brilliant from beginning to end with its perfect balance of drama, comedy and romance. Emotionally beaten down Vivian (Julia Roberts  in a role that propelled her into space) had just recently begun streetwalking when she's picked up, initially for directions, by &uuml;ber-rich Edward Lewis (Richard Gere in a masterful performance) on Hollywood Boulevard. When it's realized she's a hooker with a heart and he's a hopeless romantic, they slowly begin a relationship, despite her being requested, um paid, to be at his "beck and call" for the remainder of his business trip in L.A. Of course, things are going to get complicated as roles are defined, and others have been thrown into the mix, but these two actors were so incredibly believable, so real and had so many genuine reactions and improved lines/scenes, you will fall hard for their romance. I've wanted to write this review of one of my all time favorite movies for quite some time. Sadly, I do not think, even with the countless (home) viewings, that I will do this movie justice. I will just say what's on my mind, and always on my mind when I see this: Fantastic lines, great pacing, deep romance, believable faces, one of the best soundtracks ever, also great score, real and fun. From beginning to end, I get involved and not just because I've seen it before; it's just a journey I love to get involved in and always pretend it's my first time. So much so, that I literally smile wide (like the absolutely stunning Roberts in this) when a scene comes up I didn't allow myself to recall. This has been, is and always will be one of my all-time favorite movies. It thoroughly improved on the old Cinderella story one-hundred times. And this version is absolutely timeless. Side Note: As mentioned above, I've seen this movie 7 times in the theatre and the last 2 of those, on the same day. Just to explain, I had the day off of school, and was to meet my friends at the now-defunct Valley West Mall's dollar theatre. Actually, it was Tuesday's 50 cent day. So, while waiting on my friends, who did not have the day off, I decided on seeing Pretty Woman for the sixth and final time during the early afternoon. Little did I know, they, too, wanted to see it, so I went to go with them to the same theatre screen, the same day, to see Pretty Woman a seventh time. Side Note II: Since I am a huge Superman fan, I wanted to break this 7x in the theatre record in 2006 with Superman Returns. Sadly, as much as I liked that movie (and wanted to more) I could only make it to 5 viewings. Here's to 2013's Man of Steel. I am going to try and break the record once more!

    Pretty Woman is a decent movie with a pretty simple,clich&eacute; story line,but there is a good cast.The movie is a chick flick,but they usually have some kind of conflict,Pretty Woman is just two hours of Richard Gere and Julia Roberts going to different places with each other and showing off how in love they are,although I did think both these actors gave their best to this simple,plain movie,and they definitely had good chemistry on set,and if it wasn't for their impressive acting,I would be giving this movie a much lower rating than 6. Edward Lewis (Richard Gere) falls in love with a prostitute (Julia Roberts) he meets at Beverly Hills and begins spoiling her with his wealth.

    watching this movie at night,pretty woman gives me some thinking and surprise.it is about personality.the compare between cold thinking and warm heart.a good movie. Roberts is sweet,the changing of her emotion in this film is the main topic.no matter happy or sorrow,it is all about falling in love.this film is better than dying young,the changing is more interesting,but the main actor is not handsome than the main actor in dying young though he is more reasonable.Roberts somehow always gives person kind of happy feeling,not sad.especially when she smiles.i will watch her other movies when i am free from doing my job.though she is getting old now .

    To maintain their wholesome image, Walt Disney Studios released "Pretty Woman" under the umbrella of their ancillary company, Touchstone Pictures. But "Pretty Woman", a feature film about a prostitute who turns into a princess after meeting a Californian prince, is no more sleazy than Disney's animated films aimed at children. The message, values and narrative arcs are all the same. The plot? Richard Gere plays a millionaire who's depressed because "his father doesn't love him". Disillusioned, he prepares to dismantle and downsize his giant corporate empire. Luckily he meets a hooker played by Julia Roberts. He showers her in money, riches and fine clothes, she teaches him to be a kind, good businessman who "provides jobs to shipbuilders". She rescues him from depression and "bad" capitalism, he rescues her from the slums, prostitution and, ergo, "bad" capitalism. The couple no longer screw people over, be it as prostitutes or as corporate raiders, but engage in "moral transactions". They get married, live happily ever after and he builds warships. Like "Indecent Proposal", released around the same time, the super-wealthy are initially malevolent but reveal themselves to be caring and decent. Prostitution is good, clean, profitable, fun and "just another career choice". Women, as prostitutes, make their own decisions and are entirely independent, strong and in control of their bodies and choices. Softcore titillation is used, and the prevailing aesthetic is one which bows down to wealth, riches, materialism and money. The end goal is always monogamous marital bliss, women gladly debase themselves to be with their wealthy providers and love conquers all difficulties and is constant. Furthermore, super-rich princes are the male ideal and hookers with hearts of gold are the female ideal. Prostitution has no serious consequences, prostitution is glorified and takes place between free women and sensitive guys, and monogamous marriage, capitalism, patriarchy, and commodification are all endorsed. Elsewhere expensive finery masks amorality, men mould women into their own little dolls, corruption is unimportant (because everyone is corrupt, everyone's a whore, and so corruption is relative), corporate raiders care about people other than themselves (members from the urban poor, no less) and disparages in wealth, taste, experience and education are both cute and don't thwart romance. Compare this to Francois Truffaut's "The Soft Skin", where the provincial mannerisms of a similar woman are mocked by her aristocratic lover. To make the film work, Big Business must be glorified as much as prostitution. Gere's a Prince Charming, climbing towers to rescue his lady. Oddly, the film is adored by women. It very much represents a post-feminist stance; as all female desire is celebrated, the fantasy of winning a rich prince is super cool, even if this first means that a woman must first unconsciously self-identify as a "whore". Servitute is embraced because the self is redefined as feminine-consumer, allowed to window-shop for any and all desires, which in this case is implicitly connected to women's magazines, the fashion industry and the disciplined use of makeup, clothing, exercise etc. Everyone can be transformed from working girl to lady of leisure, everyone is allowed to dream of being valuable and feel valued, everyone is trained in the art of seduction, self-marketing, sexual gratification and consumer display. 4/10 - "My Fair Lady" meets "Cinderella" meets "Pygmalion". Worth one viewing.

    I like Julia Roberts but this was such a step backward for women. Come on seriously how could anyone think of this as a romance?? There were so many clich&eacute;s in this movie I began to wonder if it was just one big commercial for male body spray like Axe. Where could a relationship like this go? They going to have children? Hey Mom how did you and Dad meet? Oh I was hooking down on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and your Dad gave me $100 to spend the night with him. Isn't that sooo romantic. Blech! Imagine every time they get into an argument and he tells her she is just hooker anyway and should be happy with what she's got. Although, this film was made in the 90's it must have been written in the 50's back when men had some crazy control issues and wished they could just keep women down...oh wait a minute how much has really changed since then? This film is less of a Cinderella story for hookers and more of a Cinderfella story for "Johns".

    "Pretty Woman" is a lightweight but entertaining fairy tale about Prince Charming. Everything about director Garry Marshall's upbeat romantic comedy is as contrived as it is sugar coated from subversion of any sort. Although it received an R rating, this sappy two hour plus love story shows what happens to a handsome but heartless Wall Street titan when he encounters a savvy street prostitute in Beverly Hills and how their lives change radically for the better. Despite its predictable plot, "Pretty Woman" wins us over with the chemistry and charisma of the principals. Richard Gere plays protagonist Edward Lewis with wisdom and suavity. He is a businessman who buys companies and then breaks them up and sells them off. Consequently, the milk of human kindness doesn't flow in his blood. Sheer coincidence brings our hero face to face with the heroine, young but gorgeous, and "Pretty Woman" charts their fate together. Reportedly, scenarist J.T. Lawton's original script emphasized gutter realism over utter unreality. Marshall and his writers have sanded off all the rough edges. Our hero is in Los Angles when he discovers that his girlfriend is about to ditch him. He tries to drive a Lotus Esprit and nearly wrecks it. Kit and Vivian are prowling their share of the sidewalk when Edward cruises up and parks. Of course, he hasn't so much parked as jammed his car up so he cannot get it to run. He inquires for directions for Beverley Hills from her. He asks her afterward if she can drive the Lotus. They wind up at his Beverley Hills hotel and Edward buys Vivian for the night and then the week. He shells out thousands of dollars to get Vivian a proper wardrobe so she can accompany him in public and appear presentable. Chiefly, Edward wants to buy out a company that makes ships and sell it off, but the owner-founder, James Morse (Ralph Bellamy of "The Professionals") refuses to bow out without a fight. Edward did not have a good relationship with his own father Carson. Indeed, when Carter died, neither had spoken to each other in 14 and a half years. Initially, Edward savors the process of carving up Morse's company until he begins to see him as a human. Richard Gere and Julia Roberts make Edward and Vivian very palatable, very sexy, and very sympathetic. The happily ever after ending is contrived. Interestingly, the two principals move onto to better things. Ostensibly, Jason Alexander is delivers the best performance as Edward's cutthroat attorney, Philip Stuckey, who has been with him ten years. Philip's abrasive treatment of Vivian alienates Edward and he fires Philip. Hector Elizondo has a memorable supporting role as the hotel manager who helps Vivian with her wardrobe. There isn't a single character in this romantic comedy that has any depth or subtlety. Marshall relies on wardrobe to define his characters and neither the protagonist nor the heroine is ever in jeopardy. The Beverly Hills shopping scene when our heroine returns to Rodeo Driver is amusing. The people who made this diverting epic create characters that you find yourself rooting for and liking and the villains get their comeuppance.

    Calling this movie a romance is pretty much a disgrace. Let's not forget something. The heroine is a hooker! The hooker with the heart of gold! Please! I don't buy at all that Richard Gere, as a millionaire or even a $40,000 a year salesman, would fall in love with the hooker, Julia Roberts. First of all, Julia Roberts isn't all that hot. It's hard to even call her "pretty", the first word in the tittle of the movie. She's not ugly, but she's just a little above average, bordering on pretty. That aside, stud millionaires do not fall in love with hookers. They might pay one from time to time, but they don't fall in love them. The whole premise of this movie is idiotic, so the movie is unsuccessful to me as a whole. All that aside, Gere was very good in the film, and Roberts acting was also very good. The movie had outstanding production value and certain characters, like the one played by Jason Alexander, were interesting. So, as a total score, I give Pretty Woman a five.

    This is from Roy Orbinson 1964's hit song that reached its cinematic posterity 26 years later, with Garry Marshall's film of the same name. Oddly enough, when taken in the context of the film, the lyrics take a totally different significance since the titular 'pretty woman' doesn't quite walk on the streets for pleasure. Of course, the song is used for the film's trademark sequence when Vivian tries new clothes from prestigious French sounding shops, fulfilling every little girl's fantasy. But there's something genuinely appealing in Julia Robert's performance, a sort of child-like eagerness to embrace a one-week dream and do whatever she wants because she got woman's most cherished accessory, not a handbag, not a lipstick or a mirror, but a credit card. Don't take that statement as patronizing and misogynistic please, "Sex and the City" convey the same message, and bluntly assumes it. What differentiates Vivian from the other feminist icons though relies on the roots of her constant enthusiasm, forever incarnated by Robert's unique smile  and irresistible giggles. Indeed, no matter how much fun she has while seizing her luxurious days, we know that she's happy, more than anything, because she's in love. And the man might be rich, handsome and powerful, like a modernization of the 'Charming Prince' figure, there's something that oddly rings true in that peculiar love story. And this is a credit to two fine performances from Julia Roberts and Richard Gere, and a clever screenplay that doesn't take its premise for granted, starting from the obligatory meeting, which is the hit-or-miss of romantic comedies. Gere is Edward Lewis, he can't drive a friend's car and find his way to the hotel, he meets a prostitute named Vivian, she's not only attractive, but she's smart. She knows about car and end up driving him to the hotel. So, when he invites for just one night, that will turns into one week, plot-wise, the machine is working. "I want the fairy tale" she admits later, with an innocence that sweeps off all the dirt that has tarnished her life since she started walking on the streets. Never in the film, had she felt more sincere and more naively appealing. All little girls want the fairy tale, and that quote, if one thing, highlights the fact there still is that 'little girl' sparkle in Vivian's eyes, and her profession is only a logical consequence to unfortunate circumstances. But the film doesn't fall in the patronizing trap either, Vivian needs Edwards, but so does he. There's a clever parallel established by these two people's jobs, Edward buys out companies facing economic difficulties, to sell parts of them and make more profits. As she says, both screw people for money, and Edward is no more honorable than Vivian. Both hearts reflect the other's truth, that's the mark of true love and that's exactly what happens to Edward and Vivian. There's a nice subplot involving one company Edward doesn't want to buy because he likes its chairman, who's a sort of fatherly figure, wonderfully played by Ralph Bellamy, and it's only after his experience with Vivian that he realizes he doesn't enjoy his job as she did and might have chosen the wrong path for some obscure Oedipal reasons. Vivian, didn't embrace her career with more passion either, but maybe she kept on hoping of a real love, one that would be incarnated by the only thing she couldn't give her customers: a kiss. And the pay-off comes when she tenderly kisses a sleeping Edward in the mouth, at that point, we know she loves him. "Pretty Woman" doesn't overplay the whole Pygmalion-theme, that one is handled by Hector Elizondo, the hotel manager who, from despising Vivian, grows fond on her and teaches her how to properly behave. But the film doesn't use their archetypes for the sake of cheap laughs, it doesn't need to, Roberts is hilarious because she stays natural in a world she doesn't belong to, and never condescending either, Edward is inspired by her spontaneity, something that cruelly lacks in his work of sophistication and cynical materialism, incarnated by his friend and lawyer, played by Joe Constanza. Constanza, as the only true antagonist of the film, is responsible of one of the film's saddest parts, after Gere comforted him that Vivian wasn't a spy. After being approached like a cheap prostitute, you could feel she was truly hurt by Edward's betrayal. And this is what the film is about, two persons who don't want to be reduced to condescending label, one in the highest, and another in the lowest extreme. Being treated like a prostitute is the ultimate insult for Vivian because it totally negates her struggle to let her personality finally bloom, as Edward knows he's not that rich prick who only thinks in green bills. It's all about becoming yourself. I don't intend to make the film sound like an existential journey; it's still a heart-warming comedy but more intelligent and subtle than any comedy made today. And I'm sure in retrospect; many critics who despised the films would feel guilty for having labeled "Pretty Woman" too straightforwardly as a banal and commercial romantic comedy. Rom-com, chick-flick, Cinderella story, feel-good story  cinematic jargon is rich of epithets to describe Garry Marshall's "Pretty Woman". Yet these words are too convenient and tend to veil the true poignancy and endearing chemistry between the two leads. Yes, we have the rich workaholic businessman with a disastrous sentimental life, meeting the streetwise hooker, with a heart of gold, but when played by Richard Gere and Julia Roberts whose shining smile illuminates the screen like a lamppost in Hollywood Boulevard, the film turns out to far better than some cynical minds might expect. At the end, I was left wondering: aren't the so-called stereotypes the names we give to obligatory plot devices when they're wrongly handled?

    I must admit that I find this movie one of the most offensive ever to come out of Hollywood. I can suspend disbelief, but this is ridiculous. Perhaps it is because I know too much about how this movie started, have lived in Hollywood myself and seen many documentaries on the real lives of prostitutes. The original script was intended as a very dark, cautionary tale about class warfare and prostitution in the Los Angeles area. It was then completely revamped as a high budget romantic comedy. As a result, it became one of the most successful box office movies of all time. First, while there are probably many handsome johns - they rarely are as good looking as Edward (Richard Gere). Nor are they as respectful. Well, maybe on one of those sugar baby websites. But that's different than picking up some random dude on the street like Vivian (Julia Roberts) did. After their first sexual encounter, Edward hires Vivian for the week to "escort" him to social events. So she's giving it up for a whole week for 3K? Maybe that was the going rate in 1990. He also gives her access to his credit cards. I suppose that could make up for it -- and maybe there are some guys who have done that before. Seems like a stupid move to trust a woman who takes sex for money. She could run those things up in no time, especially in a ridiculously expensive town like L.A. Vivian gets snubbed on Rodeo Drive. Well, that's believable, because anyone without their nose in the air gets snubbed there - street whore or not. But being snubbed at the hotel makes no sense. Many of those hotels make their living with high end prostitutes. Or at least bimbos who look like they are. Go to any fancy hotel and you will see decked out babes. Doesn't mean they're all whores -- but many of them look like they could be. I once found out in Vegas that many women who dressed up there were hookers. And I had a classy dress that revealed nothing - in fact, it wasn't even tight. So we are supposed to believe that Vivian isn't capable of buying a dress or using utensils at the dinner table? Sorry, she is not street enough to believe that. She looks like some chick who ran away from Nebraska - not a down and dirty Hollywood whore. Or course, Heidi Fleiss had a stable of classy looking chicks. But that's the point - a woman who looks like Roberts is usually part of a service, not someone hanging out on the street. I've heard that many johns like to tell their secrets and bare their souls to whores. So when Mr. Nice Guy reveals that he was estranged from his now dead father that could make sense. Because poor little Vivian was snubbed at the store, Edward comes to the rescue and takes her shopping. I think the most dangerous thing about this film is that even though it is rated R, plenty of young girls have seen it. Glamorizing prostitution in any way is irresponsible. Some prostitutes may have married one of her johns. But that's something that happens less than the chance of winning the lotto. Prostitution will always exist, but let's not make it out to be something it isn't. Sure, there are probably some happy hookers out there - but I've not met or heard of a single one. The truth is that most of the people I've seen or known of who have sex for money came from abuse, are on drugs or have very low self esteem. This whole movie is so phony and full of lies -- not even the ad is real. They used a body double because little miss goodie two shoes herself -- Julia Roberts - while willing to play a street hooker - not only refused to do nude scenes, but the movie poster legs aren't hers, either. Or maybe she didn't look as good in the photo. I rest my case -- this movie is just a disgrace. I will agree that it deserved to be nominated for an Oscar and win some awards -- because so many movies are contrived, complete and utter nonsense.

    Rom-coms are, generally speaking, not a great genre favourite of mine. It may be a tricky balance by having to have both comedy and romantic elements but there are a dozen examples I could name that fail on either one or both counts - "The Accidental Husband", "27 Dresses", "Fifty First Dates", "Never Been Kissed", "Bridget Jones: The Edge Of Reason" and so on. Being married, it is almost inevitable that I will watch a romantic comedy at some point but occasionally, she picks an absolute corker and I'm delighted to add this movie onto the 'good' pile. It might not be a realistic picture in any meaningful sense but as a pantomime, this is as good as it gets. Richard Gere plays corporate shark Edward Lewis, hugely rich and successful and visiting LA to seal his latest acquisition. His personal life, however, is a mess and after borrowing his lawyer-friend Philip Stuckey's (Jason Alexander) Lotus and getting lost in Beverly Hills, he meets hooker Vivian (Julia Roberts) and asks her for directions. Thus begins an unusual arrangement where Vivian agrees to spend the week as Edward's escort for $3000. While Edward struggles with his increasing attraction to Vivian, she struggles for acceptance amid the high-society she now finds herself in. Despite being a pumpkin short of being a straight-up adaptation of "Cinderella", "Pretty Woman" is an unashamed romantic flight of fancy fuelled by conversations about nothing in particular and long stares full of meaning. As a fable, it is a winner but as a serious character study, the film is found wanting. Roberts never convinces as a prostitute at any point in the film, looking far too clean-cut and well-fed although she has plenty of sass and her biting back at the snobs around her is quite amusing as are her scenes with Hector Elizondo's hotel manager. Gere, for his part, has little to do but seem distant but available which is exactly what he is. But we never seem to find out why he is the way he is other than being focused on his career. Instead, we get snippets of personality such as the scene at the piano but nothing to explain why he likes playing it to complete strangers. It's maddeningly short when it comes to the details but then you remind yourself (and indeed, the movie itself does) that this is "Cinderella" and like all fairy tales, they don't bear up to well to things like plot scrutiny. I never heard anyone voice the suggestion that Cinderella is the only person in the land with that particular shoe size... So this is one of those rare films where I can forgive the faults and just enjoy the damn thing. It isn't perfect - Roberts just isn't the right actress for the part and Gere needs a serious charisma transplant - but because it's a winning story, you can sit back and go with the flow. Whether its the romance with real chemistry from the leads or the battle-of-the-classes subplot, you buy into it in a way that most rom-coms can only dream of. Certainly my Better Half had that look on her face that said "Go on, girl!" during certain scenes, although she prefers "Dirty Dancing". I can see where she's coming from - that too has problems at its heart but the soundtrack just about rescues that film for me personally. This is much more enjoyable but whatever you do, don't take it seriously and don't question the plot too much.

    "Fifty bucks, Grandpa. For seventy-five, the wife can watch." - Kit I could write this review in the dark. I've seen Pretty Woman so many times, I cannot count. I take that back: I can count how many timesI saw it in the theatre. Back in Summer 1990  yes, months after this opened, I saw it for the first time, in an empty theatre, during an afternoon weekday. I didn't want to see it, but everyone including my beloved Aunt recommended it over and over. And over. And over. So, I caved. Six more viewings, including the last 2 on the same day, and I have had a record for me for one single movie unbroken since 1990. Yes, I saw Pretty Woman 7 times in the movie theatres. Obviously, I loved it back then. And still do. It's always like an old friend when I revisit this, albeit, one I can quote word for word, but still. Granted the movie's one singular flaw is that it's not the most original concept. For that, on my personal scientific scale of rating movies, it lost one single point bringing the overall score to 99/100. Rarely, on my list, will any movie even get above 95/100, let alone 99/100and only one got to 100/100. So, when I even state the word "flaw," I mean in the absolute smallest of ways. And besides, they address this with that one funny line: "What, you want me to name someone? You want like a name? Oh, God, the pressure of a name... I got it. Cindafuckin'rella!"  Kit Actually, come to think of it, there's dozens of funny lines, motions, scenes. I laugh as hard as I cry during each viewing. This movie is absolutely brilliant from beginning to end with its perfect balance of drama, comedy and romance. Emotionally beaten down Vivian (Julia Roberts  in a role that propelled her into space) had just recently begun streetwalking when she's picked up, initially for directions, by &uuml;ber-rich Edward Lewis (Richard Gere in a masterful performance) on Hollywood Boulevard. When it's realized she's a hooker with a heart and he's a hopeless romantic, they slowly begin a relationship, despite her being requested, um paid, to be at his "beck and call" for the remainder of his business trip in L.A. Of course, things are going to get complicated as roles are defined, and others have been thrown into the mix, but these two actors were so incredibly believable, so real and had so many genuine reactions and improved lines/scenes, you will fall hard for their romance. I've wanted to write this review of one of my all time favorite movies for quite some time. Sadly, I do not think, even with the countless (home) viewings, that I will do this movie justice. I will just say what's on my mind, and always on my mind when I see this: Fantastic lines, great pacing, deep romance, believable faces, one of the best soundtracks ever, also great score, real and fun. From beginning to end, I get involved and not just because I've seen it before; it's just a journey I love to get involved in and always pretend it's my first time. So much so, that I literally smile wide (like the absolutely stunning Roberts in this) when a scene comes up I didn't allow myself to recall. This has been, is and always will be one of my all-time favorite movies. It thoroughly improved on the old Cinderella story one-hundred times. And this version is absolutely timeless. Side Note: As mentioned above, I've seen this movie 7 times in the theatre and the last 2 of those, on the same day. Just to explain, I had the day off of school, and was to meet my friends at the now-defunct Valley West Mall's dollar theatre. Actually, it was Tuesday's 50 cent day. So, while waiting on my friends, who did not have the day off, I decided on seeing Pretty Woman for the sixth and final time during the early afternoon. Little did I know, they, too, wanted to see it, so I went to go with them to the same theatre screen, the same day, to see Pretty Woman a seventh time. Side Note II: Since I am a huge Superman fan, I wanted to break this 7x in the theatre record in 2006 with Superman Returns. Sadly, as much as I liked that movie (and wanted to more) I could only make it to 5 viewings. Here's to 2013's Man of Steel. I am going to try and break the record once more!

    Pretty Woman is a decent movie with a pretty simple,clich&eacute; story line,but there is a good cast.The movie is a chick flick,but they usually have some kind of conflict,Pretty Woman is just two hours of Richard Gere and Julia Roberts going to different places with each other and showing off how in love they are,although I did think both these actors gave their best to this simple,plain movie,and they definitely had good chemistry on set,and if it wasn't for their impressive acting,I would be giving this movie a much lower rating than 6. Edward Lewis (Richard Gere) falls in love with a prostitute (Julia Roberts) he meets at Beverly Hills and begins spoiling her with his wealth.

    watching this movie at night,pretty woman gives me some thinking and surprise.it is about personality.the compare between cold thinking and warm heart.a good movie. Roberts is sweet,the changing of her emotion in this film is the main topic.no matter happy or sorrow,it is all about falling in love.this film is better than dying young,the changing is more interesting,but the main actor is not handsome than the main actor in dying young though he is more reasonable.Roberts somehow always gives person kind of happy feeling,not sad.especially when she smiles.i will watch her other movies when i am free from doing my job.though she is getting old now .

    To maintain their wholesome image, Walt Disney Studios released "Pretty Woman" under the umbrella of their ancillary company, Touchstone Pictures. But "Pretty Woman", a feature film about a prostitute who turns into a princess after meeting a Californian prince, is no more sleazy than Disney's animated films aimed at children. The message, values and narrative arcs are all the same. The plot? Richard Gere plays a millionaire who's depressed because "his father doesn't love him". Disillusioned, he prepares to dismantle and downsize his giant corporate empire. Luckily he meets a hooker played by Julia Roberts. He showers her in money, riches and fine clothes, she teaches him to be a kind, good businessman who "provides jobs to shipbuilders". She rescues him from depression and "bad" capitalism, he rescues her from the slums, prostitution and, ergo, "bad" capitalism. The couple no longer screw people over, be it as prostitutes or as corporate raiders, but engage in "moral transactions". They get married, live happily ever after and he builds warships. Like "Indecent Proposal", released around the same time, the super-wealthy are initially malevolent but reveal themselves to be caring and decent. Prostitution is good, clean, profitable, fun and "just another career choice". Women, as prostitutes, make their own decisions and are entirely independent, strong and in control of their bodies and choices. Softcore titillation is used, and the prevailing aesthetic is one which bows down to wealth, riches, materialism and money. The end goal is always monogamous marital bliss, women gladly debase themselves to be with their wealthy providers and love conquers all difficulties and is constant. Furthermore, super-rich princes are the male ideal and hookers with hearts of gold are the female ideal. Prostitution has no serious consequences, prostitution is glorified and takes place between free women and sensitive guys, and monogamous marriage, capitalism, patriarchy, and commodification are all endorsed. Elsewhere expensive finery masks amorality, men mould women into their own little dolls, corruption is unimportant (because everyone is corrupt, everyone's a whore, and so corruption is relative), corporate raiders care about people other than themselves (members from the urban poor, no less) and disparages in wealth, taste, experience and education are both cute and don't thwart romance. Compare this to Francois Truffaut's "The Soft Skin", where the provincial mannerisms of a similar woman are mocked by her aristocratic lover. To make the film work, Big Business must be glorified as much as prostitution. Gere's a Prince Charming, climbing towers to rescue his lady. Oddly, the film is adored by women. It very much represents a post-feminist stance; as all female desire is celebrated, the fantasy of winning a rich prince is super cool, even if this first means that a woman must first unconsciously self-identify as a "whore". Servitute is embraced because the self is redefined as feminine-consumer, allowed to window-shop for any and all desires, which in this case is implicitly connected to women's magazines, the fashion industry and the disciplined use of makeup, clothing, exercise etc. Everyone can be transformed from working girl to lady of leisure, everyone is allowed to dream of being valuable and feel valued, everyone is trained in the art of seduction, self-marketing, sexual gratification and consumer display. 4/10 - "My Fair Lady" meets "Cinderella" meets "Pygmalion". Worth one viewing.

    I like Julia Roberts but this was such a step backward for women. Come on seriously how could anyone think of this as a romance?? There were so many clich&eacute;s in this movie I began to wonder if it was just one big commercial for male body spray like Axe. Where could a relationship like this go? They going to have children? Hey Mom how did you and Dad meet? Oh I was hooking down on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and your Dad gave me $100 to spend the night with him. Isn't that sooo romantic. Blech! Imagine every time they get into an argument and he tells her she is just hooker anyway and should be happy with what she's got. Although, this film was made in the 90's it must have been written in the 50's back when men had some crazy control issues and wished they could just keep women down...oh wait a minute how much has really changed since then? This film is less of a Cinderella story for hookers and more of a Cinderfella story for "Johns".

    "Pretty Woman" is a lightweight but entertaining fairy tale about Prince Charming. Everything about director Garry Marshall's upbeat romantic comedy is as contrived as it is sugar coated from subversion of any sort. Although it received an R rating, this sappy two hour plus love story shows what happens to a handsome but heartless Wall Street titan when he encounters a savvy street prostitute in Beverly Hills and how their lives change radically for the better. Despite its predictable plot, "Pretty Woman" wins us over with the chemistry and charisma of the principals. Richard Gere plays protagonist Edward Lewis with wisdom and suavity. He is a businessman who buys companies and then breaks them up and sells them off. Consequently, the milk of human kindness doesn't flow in his blood. Sheer coincidence brings our hero face to face with the heroine, young but gorgeous, and "Pretty Woman" charts their fate together. Reportedly, scenarist J.T. Lawton's original script emphasized gutter realism over utter unreality. Marshall and his writers have sanded off all the rough edges. Our hero is in Los Angles when he discovers that his girlfriend is about to ditch him. He tries to drive a Lotus Esprit and nearly wrecks it. Kit and Vivian are prowling their share of the sidewalk when Edward cruises up and parks. Of course, he hasn't so much parked as jammed his car up so he cannot get it to run. He inquires for directions for Beverley Hills from her. He asks her afterward if she can drive the Lotus. They wind up at his Beverley Hills hotel and Edward buys Vivian for the night and then the week. He shells out thousands of dollars to get Vivian a proper wardrobe so she can accompany him in public and appear presentable. Chiefly, Edward wants to buy out a company that makes ships and sell it off, but the owner-founder, James Morse (Ralph Bellamy of "The Professionals") refuses to bow out without a fight. Edward did not have a good relationship with his own father Carson. Indeed, when Carter died, neither had spoken to each other in 14 and a half years. Initially, Edward savors the process of carving up Morse's company until he begins to see him as a human. Richard Gere and Julia Roberts make Edward and Vivian very palatable, very sexy, and very sympathetic. The happily ever after ending is contrived. Interestingly, the two principals move onto to better things. Ostensibly, Jason Alexander is delivers the best performance as Edward's cutthroat attorney, Philip Stuckey, who has been with him ten years. Philip's abrasive treatment of Vivian alienates Edward and he fires Philip. Hector Elizondo has a memorable supporting role as the hotel manager who helps Vivian with her wardrobe. There isn't a single character in this romantic comedy that has any depth or subtlety. Marshall relies on wardrobe to define his characters and neither the protagonist nor the heroine is ever in jeopardy. The Beverly Hills shopping scene when our heroine returns to Rodeo Driver is amusing. The people who made this diverting epic create characters that you find yourself rooting for and liking and the villains get their comeuppance.

    Calling this movie a romance is pretty much a disgrace. Let's not forget something. The heroine is a hooker! The hooker with the heart of gold! Please! I don't buy at all that Richard Gere, as a millionaire or even a $40,000 a year salesman, would fall in love with the hooker, Julia Roberts. First of all, Julia Roberts isn't all that hot. It's hard to even call her "pretty", the first word in the tittle of the movie. She's not ugly, but she's just a little above average, bordering on pretty. That aside, stud millionaires do not fall in love with hookers. They might pay one from time to time, but they don't fall in love them. The whole premise of this movie is idiotic, so the movie is unsuccessful to me as a whole. All that aside, Gere was very good in the film, and Roberts acting was also very good. The movie had outstanding production value and certain characters, like the one played by Jason Alexander, were interesting. So, as a total score, I give Pretty Woman a five.

    This is from Roy Orbinson 1964's hit song that reached its cinematic posterity 26 years later, with Garry Marshall's film of the same name. Oddly enough, when taken in the context of the film, the lyrics take a totally different significance since the titular 'pretty woman' doesn't quite walk on the streets for pleasure. Of course, the song is used for the film's trademark sequence when Vivian tries new clothes from prestigious French sounding shops, fulfilling every little girl's fantasy. But there's something genuinely appealing in Julia Robert's performance, a sort of child-like eagerness to embrace a one-week dream and do whatever she wants because she got woman's most cherished accessory, not a handbag, not a lipstick or a mirror, but a credit card. Don't take that statement as patronizing and misogynistic please, "Sex and the City" convey the same message, and bluntly assumes it. What differentiates Vivian from the other feminist icons though relies on the roots of her constant enthusiasm, forever incarnated by Robert's unique smile  and irresistible giggles. Indeed, no matter how much fun she has while seizing her luxurious days, we know that she's happy, more than anything, because she's in love. And the man might be rich, handsome and powerful, like a modernization of the 'Charming Prince' figure, there's something that oddly rings true in that peculiar love story. And this is a credit to two fine performances from Julia Roberts and Richard Gere, and a clever screenplay that doesn't take its premise for granted, starting from the obligatory meeting, which is the hit-or-miss of romantic comedies. Gere is Edward Lewis, he can't drive a friend's car and find his way to the hotel, he meets a prostitute named Vivian, she's not only attractive, but she's smart. She knows about car and end up driving him to the hotel. So, when he invites for just one night, that will turns into one week, plot-wise, the machine is working. "I want the fairy tale" she admits later, with an innocence that sweeps off all the dirt that has tarnished her life since she started walking on the streets. Never in the film, had she felt more sincere and more naively appealing. All little girls want the fairy tale, and that quote, if one thing, highlights the fact there still is that 'little girl' sparkle in Vivian's eyes, and her profession is only a logical consequence to unfortunate circumstances. But the film doesn't fall in the patronizing trap either, Vivian needs Edwards, but so does he. There's a clever parallel established by these two people's jobs, Edward buys out companies facing economic difficulties, to sell parts of them and make more profits. As she says, both screw people for money, and Edward is no more honorable than Vivian. Both hearts reflect the other's truth, that's the mark of true love and that's exactly what happens to Edward and Vivian. There's a nice subplot involving one company Edward doesn't want to buy because he likes its chairman, who's a sort of fatherly figure, wonderfully played by Ralph Bellamy, and it's only after his experience with Vivian that he realizes he doesn't enjoy his job as she did and might have chosen the wrong path for some obscure Oedipal reasons. Vivian, didn't embrace her career with more passion either, but maybe she kept on hoping of a real love, one that would be incarnated by the only thing she couldn't give her customers: a kiss. And the pay-off comes when she tenderly kisses a sleeping Edward in the mouth, at that point, we know she loves him. "Pretty Woman" doesn't overplay the whole Pygmalion-theme, that one is handled by Hector Elizondo, the hotel manager who, from despising Vivian, grows fond on her and teaches her how to properly behave. But the film doesn't use their archetypes for the sake of cheap laughs, it doesn't need to, Roberts is hilarious because she stays natural in a world she doesn't belong to, and never condescending either, Edward is inspired by her spontaneity, something that cruelly lacks in his work of sophistication and cynical materialism, incarnated by his friend and lawyer, played by Joe Constanza. Constanza, as the only true antagonist of the film, is responsible of one of the film's saddest parts, after Gere comforted him that Vivian wasn't a spy. After being approached like a cheap prostitute, you could feel she was truly hurt by Edward's betrayal. And this is what the film is about, two persons who don't want to be reduced to condescending label, one in the highest, and another in the lowest extreme. Being treated like a prostitute is the ultimate insult for Vivian because it totally negates her struggle to let her personality finally bloom, as Edward knows he's not that rich prick who only thinks in green bills. It's all about becoming yourself. I don't intend to make the film sound like an existential journey; it's still a heart-warming comedy but more intelligent and subtle than any comedy made today. And I'm sure in retrospect; many critics who despised the films would feel guilty for having labeled "Pretty Woman" too straightforwardly as a banal and commercial romantic comedy. Rom-com, chick-flick, Cinderella story, feel-good story  cinematic jargon is rich of epithets to describe Garry Marshall's "Pretty Woman". Yet these words are too convenient and tend to veil the true poignancy and endearing chemistry between the two leads. Yes, we have the rich workaholic businessman with a disastrous sentimental life, meeting the streetwise hooker, with a heart of gold, but when played by Richard Gere and Julia Roberts whose shining smile illuminates the screen like a lamppost in Hollywood Boulevard, the film turns out to far better than some cynical minds might expect. At the end, I was left wondering: aren't the so-called stereotypes the names we give to obligatory plot devices when they're wrongly handled?

    I must admit that I find this movie one of the most offensive ever to come out of Hollywood. I can suspend disbelief, but this is ridiculous. Perhaps it is because I know too much about how this movie started, have lived in Hollywood myself and seen many documentaries on the real lives of prostitutes. The original script was intended as a very dark, cautionary tale about class warfare and prostitution in the Los Angeles area. It was then completely revamped as a high budget romantic comedy. As a result, it became one of the most successful box office movies of all time. First, while there are probably many handsome johns - they rarely are as good looking as Edward (Richard Gere). Nor are they as respectful. Well, maybe on one of those sugar baby websites. But that's different than picking up some random dude on the street like Vivian (Julia Roberts) did. After their first sexual encounter, Edward hires Vivian for the week to "escort" him to social events. So she's giving it up for a whole week for 3K? Maybe that was the going rate in 1990. He also gives her access to his credit cards. I suppose that could make up for it -- and maybe there are some guys who have done that before. Seems like a stupid move to trust a woman who takes sex for money. She could run those things up in no time, especially in a ridiculously expensive town like L.A. Vivian gets snubbed on Rodeo Drive. Well, that's believable, because anyone without their nose in the air gets snubbed there - street whore or not. But being snubbed at the hotel makes no sense. Many of those hotels make their living with high end prostitutes. Or at least bimbos who look like they are. Go to any fancy hotel and you will see decked out babes. Doesn't mean they're all whores -- but many of them look like they could be. I once found out in Vegas that many women who dressed up there were hookers. And I had a classy dress that revealed nothing - in fact, it wasn't even tight. So we are supposed to believe that Vivian isn't capable of buying a dress or using utensils at the dinner table? Sorry, she is not street enough to believe that. She looks like some chick who ran away from Nebraska - not a down and dirty Hollywood whore. Or course, Heidi Fleiss had a stable of classy looking chicks. But that's the point - a woman who looks like Roberts is usually part of a service, not someone hanging out on the street. I've heard that many johns like to tell their secrets and bare their souls to whores. So when Mr. Nice Guy reveals that he was estranged from his now dead father that could make sense. Because poor little Vivian was snubbed at the store, Edward comes to the rescue and takes her shopping. I think the most dangerous thing about this film is that even though it is rated R, plenty of young girls have seen it. Glamorizing prostitution in any way is irresponsible. Some prostitutes may have married one of her johns. But that's something that happens less than the chance of winning the lotto. Prostitution will always exist, but let's not make it out to be something it isn't. Sure, there are probably some happy hookers out there - but I've not met or heard of a single one. The truth is that most of the people I've seen or known of who have sex for money came from abuse, are on drugs or have very low self esteem. This whole movie is so phony and full of lies -- not even the ad is real. They used a body double because little miss goodie two shoes herself -- Julia Roberts - while willing to play a street hooker - not only refused to do nude scenes, but the movie poster legs aren't hers, either. Or maybe she didn't look as good in the photo. I rest my case -- this movie is just a disgrace. I will agree that it deserved to be nominated for an Oscar and win some awards -- because so many movies are contrived, complete and utter nonsense.

    Rom-coms are, generally speaking, not a great genre favourite of mine. It may be a tricky balance by having to have both comedy and romantic elements but there are a dozen examples I could name that fail on either one or both counts - "The Accidental Husband", "27 Dresses", "Fifty First Dates", "Never Been Kissed", "Bridget Jones: The Edge Of Reason" and so on. Being married, it is almost inevitable that I will watch a romantic comedy at some point but occasionally, she picks an absolute corker and I'm delighted to add this movie onto the 'good' pile. It might not be a realistic picture in any meaningful sense but as a pantomime, this is as good as it gets. Richard Gere plays corporate shark Edward Lewis, hugely rich and successful and visiting LA to seal his latest acquisition. His personal life, however, is a mess and after borrowing his lawyer-friend Philip Stuckey's (Jason Alexander) Lotus and getting lost in Beverly Hills, he meets hooker Vivian (Julia Roberts) and asks her for directions. Thus begins an unusual arrangement where Vivian agrees to spend the week as Edward's escort for $3000. While Edward struggles with his increasing attraction to Vivian, she struggles for acceptance amid the high-society she now finds herself in. Despite being a pumpkin short of being a straight-up adaptation of "Cinderella", "Pretty Woman" is an unashamed romantic flight of fancy fuelled by conversations about nothing in particular and long stares full of meaning. As a fable, it is a winner but as a serious character study, the film is found wanting. Roberts never convinces as a prostitute at any point in the film, looking far too clean-cut and well-fed although she has plenty of sass and her biting back at the snobs around her is quite amusing as are her scenes with Hector Elizondo's hotel manager. Gere, for his part, has little to do but seem distant but available which is exactly what he is. But we never seem to find out why he is the way he is other than being focused on his career. Instead, we get snippets of personality such as the scene at the piano but nothing to explain why he likes playing it to complete strangers. It's maddeningly short when it comes to the details but then you remind yourself (and indeed, the movie itself does) that this is "Cinderella" and like all fairy tales, they don't bear up to well to things like plot scrutiny. I never heard anyone voice the suggestion that Cinderella is the only person in the land with that particular shoe size... So this is one of those rare films where I can forgive the faults and just enjoy the damn thing. It isn't perfect - Roberts just isn't the right actress for the part and Gere needs a serious charisma transplant - but because it's a winning story, you can sit back and go with the flow. Whether its the romance with real chemistry from the leads or the battle-of-the-classes subplot, you buy into it in a way that most rom-coms can only dream of. Certainly my Better Half had that look on her face that said "Go on, girl!" during certain scenes, although she prefers "Dirty Dancing". I can see where she's coming from - that too has problems at its heart but the soundtrack just about rescues that film for me personally. This is much more enjoyable but whatever you do, don't take it seriously and don't question the plot too much.

    "Fifty bucks, Grandpa. For seventy-five, the wife can watch." - Kit I could write this review in the dark. I've seen Pretty Woman so many times, I cannot count. I take that back: I can count how many timesI saw it in the theatre. Back in Summer 1990  yes, months after this opened, I saw it for the first time, in an empty theatre, during an afternoon weekday. I didn't want to see it, but everyone including my beloved Aunt recommended it over and over. And over. And over. So, I caved. Six more viewings, including the last 2 on the same day, and I have had a record for me for one single movie unbroken since 1990. Yes, I saw Pretty Woman 7 times in the movie theatres. Obviously, I loved it back then. And still do. It's always like an old friend when I revisit this, albeit, one I can quote word for word, but still. Granted the movie's one singular flaw is that it's not the most original concept. For that, on my personal scientific scale of rating movies, it lost one single point bringing the overall score to 99/100. Rarely, on my list, will any movie even get above 95/100, let alone 99/100and only one got to 100/100. So, when I even state the word "flaw," I mean in the absolute smallest of ways. And besides, they address this with that one funny line: "What, you want me to name someone? You want like a name? Oh, God, the pressure of a name... I got it. Cindafuckin'rella!"  Kit Actually, come to think of it, there's dozens of funny lines, motions, scenes. I laugh as hard as I cry during each viewing. This movie is absolutely brilliant from beginning to end with its perfect balance of drama, comedy and romance. Emotionally beaten down Vivian (Julia Roberts  in a role that propelled her into space) had just recently begun streetwalking when she's picked up, initially for directions, by &uuml;ber-rich Edward Lewis (Richard Gere in a masterful performance) on Hollywood Boulevard. When it's realized she's a hooker with a heart and he's a hopeless romantic, they slowly begin a relationship, despite her being requested, um paid, to be at his "beck and call" for the remainder of his business trip in L.A. Of course, things are going to get complicated as roles are defined, and others have been thrown into the mix, but these two actors were so incredibly believable, so real and had so many genuine reactions and improved lines/scenes, you will fall hard for their romance. I've wanted to write this review of one of my all time favorite movies for quite some time. Sadly, I do not think, even with the countless (home) viewings, that I will do this movie justice. I will just say what's on my mind, and always on my mind when I see this: Fantastic lines, great pacing, deep romance, believable faces, one of the best soundtracks ever, also great score, real and fun. From beginning to end, I get involved and not just because I've seen it before; it's just a journey I love to get involved in and always pretend it's my first time. So much so, that I literally smile wide (like the absolutely stunning Roberts in this) when a scene comes up I didn't allow myself to recall. This has been, is and always will be one of my all-time favorite movies. It thoroughly improved on the old Cinderella story one-hundred times. And this version is absolutely timeless. Side Note: As mentioned above, I've seen this movie 7 times in the theatre and the last 2 of those, on the same day. Just to explain, I had the day off of school, and was to meet my friends at the now-defunct Valley West Mall's dollar theatre. Actually, it was Tuesday's 50 cent day. So, while waiting on my friends, who did not have the day off, I decided on seeing Pretty Woman for the sixth and final time during the early afternoon. Little did I know, they, too, wanted to see it, so I went to go with them to the same theatre screen, the same day, to see Pretty Woman a seventh time. Side Note II: Since I am a huge Superman fan, I wanted to break this 7x in the theatre record in 2006 with Superman Returns. Sadly, as much as I liked that movie (and wanted to more) I could only make it to 5 viewings. Here's to 2013's Man of Steel. I am going to try and break the record once more!

    Pretty Woman is a decent movie with a pretty simple,clich&eacute; story line,but there is a good cast.The movie is a chick flick,but they usually have some kind of conflict,Pretty Woman is just two hours of Richard Gere and Julia Roberts going to different places with each other and showing off how in love they are,although I did think both these actors gave their best to this simple,plain movie,and they definitely had good chemistry on set,and if it wasn't for their impressive acting,I would be giving this movie a much lower rating than 6. Edward Lewis (Richard Gere) falls in love with a prostitute (Julia Roberts) he meets at Beverly Hills and begins spoiling her with his wealth.

    watching this movie at night,pretty woman gives me some thinking and surprise.it is about personality.the compare between cold thinking and warm heart.a good movie. Roberts is sweet,the changing of her emotion in this film is the main topic.no matter happy or sorrow,it is all about falling in love.this film is better than dying young,the changing is more interesting,but the main actor is not handsome than the main actor in dying young though he is more reasonable.Roberts somehow always gives person kind of happy feeling,not sad.especially when she smiles.i will watch her other movies when i am free from doing my job.though she is getting old now .

    To maintain their wholesome image, Walt Disney Studios released "Pretty Woman" under the umbrella of their ancillary company, Touchstone Pictures. But "Pretty Woman", a feature film about a prostitute who turns into a princess after meeting a Californian prince, is no more sleazy than Disney's animated films aimed at children. The message, values and narrative arcs are all the same. The plot? Richard Gere plays a millionaire who's depressed because "his father doesn't love him". Disillusioned, he prepares to dismantle and downsize his giant corporate empire. Luckily he meets a hooker played by Julia Roberts. He showers her in money, riches and fine clothes, she teaches him to be a kind, good businessman who "provides jobs to shipbuilders". She rescues him from depression and "bad" capitalism, he rescues her from the slums, prostitution and, ergo, "bad" capitalism. The couple no longer screw people over, be it as prostitutes or as corporate raiders, but engage in "moral transactions". They get married, live happily ever after and he builds warships. Like "Indecent Proposal", released around the same time, the super-wealthy are initially malevolent but reveal themselves to be caring and decent. Prostitution is good, clean, profitable, fun and "just another career choice". Women, as prostitutes, make their own decisions and are entirely independent, strong and in control of their bodies and choices. Softcore titillation is used, and the prevailing aesthetic is one which bows down to wealth, riches, materialism and money. The end goal is always monogamous marital bliss, women gladly debase themselves to be with their wealthy providers and love conquers all difficulties and is constant. Furthermore, super-rich princes are the male ideal and hookers with hearts of gold are the female ideal. Prostitution has no serious consequences, prostitution is glorified and takes place between free women and sensitive guys, and monogamous marriage, capitalism, patriarchy, and commodification are all endorsed. Elsewhere expensive finery masks amorality, men mould women into their own little dolls, corruption is unimportant (because everyone is corrupt, everyone's a whore, and so corruption is relative), corporate raiders care about people other than themselves (members from the urban poor, no less) and disparages in wealth, taste, experience and education are both cute and don't thwart romance. Compare this to Francois Truffaut's "The Soft Skin", where the provincial mannerisms of a similar woman are mocked by her aristocratic lover. To make the film work, Big Business must be glorified as much as prostitution. Gere's a Prince Charming, climbing towers to rescue his lady. Oddly, the film is adored by women. It very much represents a post-feminist stance; as all female desire is celebrated, the fantasy of winning a rich prince is super cool, even if this first means that a woman must first unconsciously self-identify as a "whore". Servitute is embraced because the self is redefined as feminine-consumer, allowed to window-shop for any and all desires, which in this case is implicitly connected to women's magazines, the fashion industry and the disciplined use of makeup, clothing, exercise etc. Everyone can be transformed from working girl to lady of leisure, everyone is allowed to dream of being valuable and feel valued, everyone is trained in the art of seduction, self-marketing, sexual gratification and consumer display. 4/10 - "My Fair Lady" meets "Cinderella" meets "Pygmalion". Worth one viewing.

    I like Julia Roberts but this was such a step backward for women. Come on seriously how could anyone think of this as a romance?? There were so many clich&eacute;s in this movie I began to wonder if it was just one big commercial for male body spray like Axe. Where could a relationship like this go? They going to have children? Hey Mom how did you and Dad meet? Oh I was hooking down on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and your Dad gave me $100 to spend the night with him. Isn't that sooo romantic. Blech! Imagine every time they get into an argument and he tells her she is just hooker anyway and should be happy with what she's got. Although, this film was made in the 90's it must have been written in the 50's back when men had some crazy control issues and wished they could just keep women down...oh wait a minute how much has really changed since then? This film is less of a Cinderella story for hookers and more of a Cinderfella story for "Johns".

    "Pretty Woman" is a lightweight but entertaining fairy tale about Prince Charming. Everything about director Garry Marshall's upbeat romantic comedy is as contrived as it is sugar coated from subversion of any sort. Although it received an R rating, this sappy two hour plus love story shows what happens to a handsome but heartless Wall Street titan when he encounters a savvy street prostitute in Beverly Hills and how their lives change radically for the better. Despite its predictable plot, "Pretty Woman" wins us over with the chemistry and charisma of the principals. Richard Gere plays protagonist Edward Lewis with wisdom and suavity. He is a businessman who buys companies and then breaks them up and sells them off. Consequently, the milk of human kindness doesn't flow in his blood. Sheer coincidence brings our hero face to face with the heroine, young but gorgeous, and "Pretty Woman" charts their fate together. Reportedly, scenarist J.T. Lawton's original script emphasized gutter realism over utter unreality. Marshall and his writers have sanded off all the rough edges. Our hero is in Los Angles when he discovers that his girlfriend is about to ditch him. He tries to drive a Lotus Esprit and nearly wrecks it. Kit and Vivian are prowling their share of the sidewalk when Edward cruises up and parks. Of course, he hasn't so much parked as jammed his car up so he cannot get it to run. He inquires for directions for Beverley Hills from her. He asks her afterward if she can drive the Lotus. They wind up at his Beverley Hills hotel and Edward buys Vivian for the night and then the week. He shells out thousands of dollars to get Vivian a proper wardrobe so she can accompany him in public and appear presentable. Chiefly, Edward wants to buy out a company that makes ships and sell it off, but the owner-founder, James Morse (Ralph Bellamy of "The Professionals") refuses to bow out without a fight. Edward did not have a good relationship with his own father Carson. Indeed, when Carter died, neither had spoken to each other in 14 and a half years. Initially, Edward savors the process of carving up Morse's company until he begins to see him as a human. Richard Gere and Julia Roberts make Edward and Vivian very palatable, very sexy, and very sympathetic. The happily ever after ending is contrived. Interestingly, the two principals move onto to better things. Ostensibly, Jason Alexander is delivers the best performance as Edward's cutthroat attorney, Philip Stuckey, who has been with him ten years. Philip's abrasive treatment of Vivian alienates Edward and he fires Philip. Hector Elizondo has a memorable supporting role as the hotel manager who helps Vivian with her wardrobe. There isn't a single character in this romantic comedy that has any depth or subtlety. Marshall relies on wardrobe to define his characters and neither the protagonist nor the heroine is ever in jeopardy. The Beverly Hills shopping scene when our heroine returns to Rodeo Driver is amusing. The people who made this diverting epic create characters that you find yourself rooting for and liking and the villains get their comeuppance.

    Calling this movie a romance is pretty much a disgrace. Let's not forget something. The heroine is a hooker! The hooker with the heart of gold! Please! I don't buy at all that Richard Gere, as a millionaire or even a $40,000 a year salesman, would fall in love with the hooker, Julia Roberts. First of all, Julia Roberts isn't all that hot. It's hard to even call her "pretty", the first word in the tittle of the movie. She's not ugly, but she's just a little above average, bordering on pretty. That aside, stud millionaires do not fall in love with hookers. They might pay one from time to time, but they don't fall in love them. The whole premise of this movie is idiotic, so the movie is unsuccessful to me as a whole. All that aside, Gere was very good in the film, and Roberts acting was also very good. The movie had outstanding production value and certain characters, like the one played by Jason Alexander, were interesting. So, as a total score, I give Pretty Woman a five.

    This is from Roy Orbinson 1964's hit song that reached its cinematic posterity 26 years later, with Garry Marshall's film of the same name. Oddly enough, when taken in the context of the film, the lyrics take a totally different significance since the titular 'pretty woman' doesn't quite walk on the streets for pleasure. Of course, the song is used for the film's trademark sequence when Vivian tries new clothes from prestigious French sounding shops, fulfilling every little girl's fantasy. But there's something genuinely appealing in Julia Robert's performance, a sort of child-like eagerness to embrace a one-week dream and do whatever she wants because she got woman's most cherished accessory, not a handbag, not a lipstick or a mirror, but a credit card. Don't take that statement as patronizing and misogynistic please, "Sex and the City" convey the same message, and bluntly assumes it. What differentiates Vivian from the other feminist icons though relies on the roots of her constant enthusiasm, forever incarnated by Robert's unique smile  and irresistible giggles. Indeed, no matter how much fun she has while seizing her luxurious days, we know that she's happy, more than anything, because she's in love. And the man might be rich, handsome and powerful, like a modernization of the 'Charming Prince' figure, there's something that oddly rings true in that peculiar love story. And this is a credit to two fine performances from Julia Roberts and Richard Gere, and a clever screenplay that doesn't take its premise for granted, starting from the obligatory meeting, which is the hit-or-miss of romantic comedies. Gere is Edward Lewis, he can't drive a friend's car and find his way to the hotel, he meets a prostitute named Vivian, she's not only attractive, but she's smart. She knows about car and end up driving him to the hotel. So, when he invites for just one night, that will turns into one week, plot-wise, the machine is working. "I want the fairy tale" she admits later, with an innocence that sweeps off all the dirt that has tarnished her life since she started walking on the streets. Never in the film, had she felt more sincere and more naively appealing. All little girls want the fairy tale, and that quote, if one thing, highlights the fact there still is that 'little girl' sparkle in Vivian's eyes, and her profession is only a logical consequence to unfortunate circumstances. But the film doesn't fall in the patronizing trap either, Vivian needs Edwards, but so does he. There's a clever parallel established by these two people's jobs, Edward buys out companies facing economic difficulties, to sell parts of them and make more profits. As she says, both screw people for money, and Edward is no more honorable than Vivian. Both hearts reflect the other's truth, that's the mark of true love and that's exactly what happens to Edward and Vivian. There's a nice subplot involving one company Edward doesn't want to buy because he likes its chairman, who's a sort of fatherly figure, wonderfully played by Ralph Bellamy, and it's only after his experience with Vivian that he realizes he doesn't enjoy his job as she did and might have chosen the wrong path for some obscure Oedipal reasons. Vivian, didn't embrace her career with more passion either, but maybe she kept on hoping of a real love, one that would be incarnated by the only thing she couldn't give her customers: a kiss. And the pay-off comes when she tenderly kisses a sleeping Edward in the mouth, at that point, we know she loves him. "Pretty Woman" doesn't overplay the whole Pygmalion-theme, that one is handled by Hector Elizondo, the hotel manager who, from despising Vivian, grows fond on her and teaches her how to properly behave. But the film doesn't use their archetypes for the sake of cheap laughs, it doesn't need to, Roberts is hilarious because she stays natural in a world she doesn't belong to, and never condescending either, Edward is inspired by her spontaneity, something that cruelly lacks in his work of sophistication and cynical materialism, incarnated by his friend and lawyer, played by Joe Constanza. Constanza, as the only true antagonist of the film, is responsible of one of the film's saddest parts, after Gere comforted him that Vivian wasn't a spy. After being approached like a cheap prostitute, you could feel she was truly hurt by Edward's betrayal. And this is what the film is about, two persons who don't want to be reduced to condescending label, one in the highest, and another in the lowest extreme. Being treated like a prostitute is the ultimate insult for Vivian because it totally negates her struggle to let her personality finally bloom, as Edward knows he's not that rich prick who only thinks in green bills. It's all about becoming yourself. I don't intend to make the film sound like an existential journey; it's still a heart-warming comedy but more intelligent and subtle than any comedy made today. And I'm sure in retrospect; many critics who despised the films would feel guilty for having labeled "Pretty Woman" too straightforwardly as a banal and commercial romantic comedy. Rom-com, chick-flick, Cinderella story, feel-good story  cinematic jargon is rich of epithets to describe Garry Marshall's "Pretty Woman". Yet these words are too convenient and tend to veil the true poignancy and endearing chemistry between the two leads. Yes, we have the rich workaholic businessman with a disastrous sentimental life, meeting the streetwise hooker, with a heart of gold, but when played by Richard Gere and Julia Roberts whose shining smile illuminates the screen like a lamppost in Hollywood Boulevard, the film turns out to far better than some cynical minds might expect. At the end, I was left wondering: aren't the so-called stereotypes the names we give to obligatory plot devices when they're wrongly handled?

    I must admit that I find this movie one of the most offensive ever to come out of Hollywood. I can suspend disbelief, but this is ridiculous. Perhaps it is because I know too much about how this movie started, have lived in Hollywood myself and seen many documentaries on the real lives of prostitutes. The original script was intended as a very dark, cautionary tale about class warfare and prostitution in the Los Angeles area. It was then completely revamped as a high budget romantic comedy. As a result, it became one of the most successful box office movies of all time. First, while there are probably many handsome johns - they rarely are as good looking as Edward (Richard Gere). Nor are they as respectful. Well, maybe on one of those sugar baby websites. But that's different than picking up some random dude on the street like Vivian (Julia Roberts) did. After their first sexual encounter, Edward hires Vivian for the week to "escort" him to social events. So she's giving it up for a whole week for 3K? Maybe that was the going rate in 1990. He also gives her access to his credit cards. I suppose that could make up for it -- and maybe there are some guys who have done that before. Seems like a stupid move to trust a woman who takes sex for money. She could run those things up in no time, especially in a ridiculously expensive town like L.A. Vivian gets snubbed on Rodeo Drive. Well, that's believable, because anyone without their nose in the air gets snubbed there - street whore or not. But being snubbed at the hotel makes no sense. Many of those hotels make their living with high end prostitutes. Or at least bimbos who look like they are. Go to any fancy hotel and you will see decked out babes. Doesn't mean they're all whores -- but many of them look like they could be. I once found out in Vegas that many women who dressed up there were hookers. And I had a classy dress that revealed nothing - in fact, it wasn't even tight. So we are supposed to believe that Vivian isn't capable of buying a dress or using utensils at the dinner table? Sorry, she is not street enough to believe that. She looks like some chick who ran away from Nebraska - not a down and dirty Hollywood whore. Or course, Heidi Fleiss had a stable of classy looking chicks. But that's the point - a woman who looks like Roberts is usually part of a service, not someone hanging out on the street. I've heard that many johns like to tell their secrets and bare their souls to whores. So when Mr. Nice Guy reveals that he was estranged from his now dead father that could make sense. Because poor little Vivian was snubbed at the store, Edward comes to the rescue and takes her shopping. I think the most dangerous thing about this film is that even though it is rated R, plenty of young girls have seen it. Glamorizing prostitution in any way is irresponsible. Some prostitutes may have married one of her johns. But that's something that happens less than the chance of winning the lotto. Prostitution will always exist, but let's not make it out to be something it isn't. Sure, there are probably some happy hookers out there - but I've not met or heard of a single one. The truth is that most of the people I've seen or known of who have sex for money came from abuse, are on drugs or have very low self esteem. This whole movie is so phony and full of lies -- not even the ad is real. They used a body double because little miss goodie two shoes herself -- Julia Roberts - while willing to play a street hooker - not only refused to do nude scenes, but the movie poster legs aren't hers, either. Or maybe she didn't look as good in the photo. I rest my case -- this movie is just a disgrace. I will agree that it deserved to be nominated for an Oscar and win some awards -- because so many movies are contrived, complete and utter nonsense.

    Rom-coms are, generally speaking, not a great genre favourite of mine. It may be a tricky balance by having to have both comedy and romantic elements but there are a dozen examples I could name that fail on either one or both counts - "The Accidental Husband", "27 Dresses", "Fifty First Dates", "Never Been Kissed", "Bridget Jones: The Edge Of Reason" and so on. Being married, it is almost inevitable that I will watch a romantic comedy at some point but occasionally, she picks an absolute corker and I'm delighted to add this movie onto the 'good' pile. It might not be a realistic picture in any meaningful sense but as a pantomime, this is as good as it gets. Richard Gere plays corporate shark Edward Lewis, hugely rich and successful and visiting LA to seal his latest acquisition. His personal life, however, is a mess and after borrowing his lawyer-friend Philip Stuckey's (Jason Alexander) Lotus and getting lost in Beverly Hills, he meets hooker Vivian (Julia Roberts) and asks her for directions. Thus begins an unusual arrangement where Vivian agrees to spend the week as Edward's escort for $3000. While Edward struggles with his increasing attraction to Vivian, she struggles for acceptance amid the high-society she now finds herself in. Despite being a pumpkin short of being a straight-up adaptation of "Cinderella", "Pretty Woman" is an unashamed romantic flight of fancy fuelled by conversations about nothing in particular and long stares full of meaning. As a fable, it is a winner but as a serious character study, the film is found wanting. Roberts never convinces as a prostitute at any point in the film, looking far too clean-cut and well-fed although she has plenty of sass and her biting back at the snobs around her is quite amusing as are her scenes with Hector Elizondo's hotel manager. Gere, for his part, has little to do but seem distant but available which is exactly what he is. But we never seem to find out why he is the way he is other than being focused on his career. Instead, we get snippets of personality such as the scene at the piano but nothing to explain why he likes playing it to complete strangers. It's maddeningly short when it comes to the details but then you remind yourself (and indeed, the movie itself does) that this is "Cinderella" and like all fairy tales, they don't bear up to well to things like plot scrutiny. I never heard anyone voice the suggestion that Cinderella is the only person in the land with that particular shoe size... So this is one of those rare films where I can forgive the faults and just enjoy the damn thing. It isn't perfect - Roberts just isn't the right actress for the part and Gere needs a serious charisma transplant - but because it's a winning story, you can sit back and go with the flow. Whether its the romance with real chemistry from the leads or the battle-of-the-classes subplot, you buy into it in a way that most rom-coms can only dream of. Certainly my Better Half had that look on her face that said "Go on, girl!" during certain scenes, although she prefers "Dirty Dancing". I can see where she's coming from - that too has problems at its heart but the soundtrack just about rescues that film for me personally. This is much more enjoyable but whatever you do, don't take it seriously and don't question the plot too much.

    "Fifty bucks, Grandpa. For seventy-five, the wife can watch." - Kit I could write this review in the dark. I've seen Pretty Woman so many times, I cannot count. I take that back: I can count how many timesI saw it in the theatre. Back in Summer 1990  yes, months after this opened, I saw it for the first time, in an empty theatre, during an afternoon weekday. I didn't want to see it, but everyone including my beloved Aunt recommended it over and over. And over. And over. So, I caved. Six more viewings, including the last 2 on the same day, and I have had a record for me for one single movie unbroken since 1990. Yes, I saw Pretty Woman 7 times in the movie theatres. Obviously, I loved it back then. And still do. It's always like an old friend when I revisit this, albeit, one I can quote word for word, but still. Granted the movie's one singular flaw is that it's not the most original concept. For that, on my personal scientific scale of rating movies, it lost one single point bringing the overall score to 99/100. Rarely, on my list, will any movie even get above 95/100, let alone 99/100and only one got to 100/100. So, when I even state the word "flaw," I mean in the absolute smallest of ways. And besides, they address this with that one funny line: "What, you want me to name someone? You want like a name? Oh, God, the pressure of a name... I got it. Cindafuckin'rella!"  Kit Actually, come to think of it, there's dozens of funny lines, motions, scenes. I laugh as hard as I cry during each viewing. This movie is absolutely brilliant from beginning to end with its perfect balance of drama, comedy and romance. Emotionally beaten down Vivian (Julia Roberts  in a role that propelled her into space) had just recently begun streetwalking when she's picked up, initially for directions, by &uuml;ber-rich Edward Lewis (Richard Gere in a masterful performance) on Hollywood Boulevard. When it's realized she's a hooker with a heart and he's a hopeless romantic, they slowly begin a relationship, despite her being requested, um paid, to be at his "beck and call" for the remainder of his business trip in L.A. Of course, things are going to get complicated as roles are defined, and others have been thrown into the mix, but these two actors were so incredibly believable, so real and had so many genuine reactions and improved lines/scenes, you will fall hard for their romance. I've wanted to write this review of one of my all time favorite movies for quite some time. Sadly, I do not think, even with the countless (home) viewings, that I will do this movie justice. I will just say what's on my mind, and always on my mind when I see this: Fantastic lines, great pacing, deep romance, believable faces, one of the best soundtracks ever, also great score, real and fun. From beginning to end, I get involved and not just because I've seen it before; it's just a journey I love to get involved in and always pretend it's my first time. So much so, that I literally smile wide (like the absolutely stunning Roberts in this) when a scene comes up I didn't allow myself to recall. This has been, is and always will be one of my all-time favorite movies. It thoroughly improved on the old Cinderella story one-hundred times. And this version is absolutely timeless. Side Note: As mentioned above, I've seen this movie 7 times in the theatre and the last 2 of those, on the same day. Just to explain, I had the day off of school, and was to meet my friends at the now-defunct Valley West Mall's dollar theatre. Actually, it was Tuesday's 50 cent day. So, while waiting on my friends, who did not have the day off, I decided on seeing Pretty Woman for the sixth and final time during the early afternoon. Little did I know, they, too, wanted to see it, so I went to go with them to the same theatre screen, the same day, to see Pretty Woman a seventh time. Side Note II: Since I am a huge Superman fan, I wanted to break this 7x in the theatre record in 2006 with Superman Returns. Sadly, as much as I liked that movie (and wanted to more) I could only make it to 5 viewings. Here's to 2013's Man of Steel. I am going to try and break the record once more!

    Pretty Woman is a decent movie with a pretty simple,clich&eacute; story line,but there is a good cast.The movie is a chick flick,but they usually have some kind of conflict,Pretty Woman is just two hours of Richard Gere and Julia Roberts going to different places with each other and showing off how in love they are,although I did think both these actors gave their best to this simple,plain movie,and they definitely had good chemistry on set,and if it wasn't for their impressive acting,I would be giving this movie a much lower rating than 6. Edward Lewis (Richard Gere) falls in love with a prostitute (Julia Roberts) he meets at Beverly Hills and begins spoiling her with his wealth.

    watching this movie at night,pretty woman gives me some thinking and surprise.it is about personality.the compare between cold thinking and warm heart.a good movie. Roberts is sweet,the changing of her emotion in this film is the main topic.no matter happy or sorrow,it is all about falling in love.this film is better than dying young,the changing is more interesting,but the main actor is not handsome than the main actor in dying young though he is more reasonable.Roberts somehow always gives person kind of happy feeling,not sad.especially when she smiles.i will watch her other movies when i am free from doing my job.though she is getting old now .

    To maintain their wholesome image, Walt Disney Studios released "Pretty Woman" under the umbrella of their ancillary company, Touchstone Pictures. But "Pretty Woman", a feature film about a prostitute who turns into a princess after meeting a Californian prince, is no more sleazy than Disney's animated films aimed at children. The message, values and narrative arcs are all the same. The plot? Richard Gere plays a millionaire who's depressed because "his father doesn't love him". Disillusioned, he prepares to dismantle and downsize his giant corporate empire. Luckily he meets a hooker played by Julia Roberts. He showers her in money, riches and fine clothes, she teaches him to be a kind, good businessman who "provides jobs to shipbuilders". She rescues him from depression and "bad" capitalism, he rescues her from the slums, prostitution and, ergo, "bad" capitalism. The couple no longer screw people over, be it as prostitutes or as corporate raiders, but engage in "moral transactions". They get married, live happily ever after and he builds warships. Like "Indecent Proposal", released around the same time, the super-wealthy are initially malevolent but reveal themselves to be caring and decent. Prostitution is good, clean, profitable, fun and "just another career choice". Women, as prostitutes, make their own decisions and are entirely independent, strong and in control of their bodies and choices. Softcore titillation is used, and the prevailing aesthetic is one which bows down to wealth, riches, materialism and money. The end goal is always monogamous marital bliss, women gladly debase themselves to be with their wealthy providers and love conquers all difficulties and is constant. Furthermore, super-rich princes are the male ideal and hookers with hearts of gold are the female ideal. Prostitution has no serious consequences, prostitution is glorified and takes place between free women and sensitive guys, and monogamous marriage, capitalism, patriarchy, and commodification are all endorsed. Elsewhere expensive finery masks amorality, men mould women into their own little dolls, corruption is unimportant (because everyone is corrupt, everyone's a whore, and so corruption is relative), corporate raiders care about people other than themselves (members from the urban poor, no less) and disparages in wealth, taste, experience and education are both cute and don't thwart romance. Compare this to Francois Truffaut's "The Soft Skin", where the provincial mannerisms of a similar woman are mocked by her aristocratic lover. To make the film work, Big Business must be glorified as much as prostitution. Gere's a Prince Charming, climbing towers to rescue his lady. Oddly, the film is adored by women. It very much represents a post-feminist stance; as all female desire is celebrated, the fantasy of winning a rich prince is super cool, even if this first means that a woman must first unconsciously self-identify as a "whore". Servitute is embraced because the self is redefined as feminine-consumer, allowed to window-shop for any and all desires, which in this case is implicitly connected to women's magazines, the fashion industry and the disciplined use of makeup, clothing, exercise etc. Everyone can be transformed from working girl to lady of leisure, everyone is allowed to dream of being valuable and feel valued, everyone is trained in the art of seduction, self-marketing, sexual gratification and consumer display. 4/10 - "My Fair Lady" meets "Cinderella" meets "Pygmalion". Worth one viewing.

    I like Julia Roberts but this was such a step backward for women. Come on seriously how could anyone think of this as a romance?? There were so many clich&eacute;s in this movie I began to wonder if it was just one big commercial for male body spray like Axe. Where could a relationship like this go? They going to have children? Hey Mom how did you and Dad meet? Oh I was hooking down on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and your Dad gave me $100 to spend the night with him. Isn't that sooo romantic. Blech! Imagine every time they get into an argument and he tells her she is just hooker anyway and should be happy with what she's got. Although, this film was made in the 90's it must have been written in the 50's back when men had some crazy control issues and wished they could just keep women down...oh wait a minute how much has really changed since then? This film is less of a Cinderella story for hookers and more of a Cinderfella story for "Johns".

    "Pretty Woman" is a lightweight but entertaining fairy tale about Prince Charming. Everything about director Garry Marshall's upbeat romantic comedy is as contrived as it is sugar coated from subversion of any sort. Although it received an R rating, this sappy two hour plus love story shows what happens to a handsome but heartless Wall Street titan when he encounters a savvy street prostitute in Beverly Hills and how their lives change radically for the better. Despite its predictable plot, "Pretty Woman" wins us over with the chemistry and charisma of the principals. Richard Gere plays protagonist Edward Lewis with wisdom and suavity. He is a businessman who buys companies and then breaks them up and sells them off. Consequently, the milk of human kindness doesn't flow in his blood. Sheer coincidence brings our hero face to face with the heroine, young but gorgeous, and "Pretty Woman" charts their fate together. Reportedly, scenarist J.T. Lawton's original script emphasized gutter realism over utter unreality. Marshall and his writers have sanded off all the rough edges. Our hero is in Los Angles when he discovers that his girlfriend is about to ditch him. He tries to drive a Lotus Esprit and nearly wrecks it. Kit and Vivian are prowling their share of the sidewalk when Edward cruises up and parks. Of course, he hasn't so much parked as jammed his car up so he cannot get it to run. He inquires for directions for Beverley Hills from her. He asks her afterward if she can drive the Lotus. They wind up at his Beverley Hills hotel and Edward buys Vivian for the night and then the week. He shells out thousands of dollars to get Vivian a proper wardrobe so she can accompany him in public and appear presentable. Chiefly, Edward wants to buy out a company that makes ships and sell it off, but the owner-founder, James Morse (Ralph Bellamy of "The Professionals") refuses to bow out without a fight. Edward did not have a good relationship with his own father Carson. Indeed, when Carter died, neither had spoken to each other in 14 and a half years. Initially, Edward savors the process of carving up Morse's company until he begins to see him as a human. Richard Gere and Julia Roberts make Edward and Vivian very palatable, very sexy, and very sympathetic. The happily ever after ending is contrived. Interestingly, the two principals move onto to better things. Ostensibly, Jason Alexander is delivers the best performance as Edward's cutthroat attorney, Philip Stuckey, who has been with him ten years. Philip's abrasive treatment of Vivian alienates Edward and he fires Philip. Hector Elizondo has a memorable supporting role as the hotel manager who helps Vivian with her wardrobe. There isn't a single character in this romantic comedy that has any depth or subtlety. Marshall relies on wardrobe to define his characters and neither the protagonist nor the heroine is ever in jeopardy. The Beverly Hills shopping scene when our heroine returns to Rodeo Driver is amusing. The people who made this diverting epic create characters that you find yourself rooting for and liking and the villains get their comeuppance.

    Calling this movie a romance is pretty much a disgrace. Let's not forget something. The heroine is a hooker! The hooker with the heart of gold! Please! I don't buy at all that Richard Gere, as a millionaire or even a $40,000 a year salesman, would fall in love with the hooker, Julia Roberts. First of all, Julia Roberts isn't all that hot. It's hard to even call her "pretty", the first word in the tittle of the movie. She's not ugly, but she's just a little above average, bordering on pretty. That aside, stud millionaires do not fall in love with hookers. They might pay one from time to time, but they don't fall in love them. The whole premise of this movie is idiotic, so the movie is unsuccessful to me as a whole. All that aside, Gere was very good in the film, and Roberts acting was also very good. The movie had outstanding production value and certain characters, like the one played by Jason Alexander, were interesting. So, as a total score, I give Pretty Woman a five.

    This is from Roy Orbinson 1964's hit song that reached its cinematic posterity 26 years later, with Garry Marshall's film of the same name. Oddly enough, when taken in the context of the film, the lyrics take a totally different significance since the titular 'pretty woman' doesn't quite walk on the streets for pleasure. Of course, the song is used for the film's trademark sequence when Vivian tries new clothes from prestigious French sounding shops, fulfilling every little girl's fantasy. But there's something genuinely appealing in Julia Robert's performance, a sort of child-like eagerness to embrace a one-week dream and do whatever she wants because she got woman's most cherished accessory, not a handbag, not a lipstick or a mirror, but a credit card. Don't take that statement as patronizing and misogynistic please, "Sex and the City" convey the same message, and bluntly assumes it. What differentiates Vivian from the other feminist icons though relies on the roots of her constant enthusiasm, forever incarnated by Robert's unique smile  and irresistible giggles. Indeed, no matter how much fun she has while seizing her luxurious days, we know that she's happy, more than anything, because she's in love. And the man might be rich, handsome and powerful, like a modernization of the 'Charming Prince' figure, there's something that oddly rings true in that peculiar love story. And this is a credit to two fine performances from Julia Roberts and Richard Gere, and a clever screenplay that doesn't take its premise for granted, starting from the obligatory meeting, which is the hit-or-miss of romantic comedies. Gere is Edward Lewis, he can't drive a friend's car and find his way to the hotel, he meets a prostitute named Vivian, she's not only attractive, but she's smart. She knows about car and end up driving him to the hotel. So, when he invites for just one night, that will turns into one week, plot-wise, the machine is working. "I want the fairy tale" she admits later, with an innocence that sweeps off all the dirt that has tarnished her life since she started walking on the streets. Never in the film, had she felt more sincere and more naively appealing. All little girls want the fairy tale, and that quote, if one thing, highlights the fact there still is that 'little girl' sparkle in Vivian's eyes, and her profession is only a logical consequence to unfortunate circumstances. But the film doesn't fall in the patronizing trap either, Vivian needs Edwards, but so does he. There's a clever parallel established by these two people's jobs, Edward buys out companies facing economic difficulties, to sell parts of them and make more profits. As she says, both screw people for money, and Edward is no more honorable than Vivian. Both hearts reflect the other's truth, that's the mark of true love and that's exactly what happens to Edward and Vivian. There's a nice subplot involving one company Edward doesn't want to buy because he likes its chairman, who's a sort of fatherly figure, wonderfully played by Ralph Bellamy, and it's only after his experience with Vivian that he realizes he doesn't enjoy his job as she did and might have chosen the wrong path for some obscure Oedipal reasons. Vivian, didn't embrace her career with more passion either, but maybe she kept on hoping of a real love, one that would be incarnated by the only thing she couldn't give her customers: a kiss. And the pay-off comes when she tenderly kisses a sleeping Edward in the mouth, at that point, we know she loves him. "Pretty Woman" doesn't overplay the whole Pygmalion-theme, that one is handled by Hector Elizondo, the hotel manager who, from despising Vivian, grows fond on her and teaches her how to properly behave. But the film doesn't use their archetypes for the sake of cheap laughs, it doesn't need to, Roberts is hilarious because she stays natural in a world she doesn't belong to, and never condescending either, Edward is inspired by her spontaneity, something that cruelly lacks in his work of sophistication and cynical materialism, incarnated by his friend and lawyer, played by Joe Constanza. Constanza, as the only true antagonist of the film, is responsible of one of the film's saddest parts, after Gere comforted him that Vivian wasn't a spy. After being approached like a cheap prostitute, you could feel she was truly hurt by Edward's betrayal. And this is what the film is about, two persons who don't want to be reduced to condescending label, one in the highest, and another in the lowest extreme. Being treated like a prostitute is the ultimate insult for Vivian because it totally negates her struggle to let her personality finally bloom, as Edward knows he's not that rich prick who only thinks in green bills. It's all about becoming yourself. I don't intend to make the film sound like an existential journey; it's still a heart-warming comedy but more intelligent and subtle than any comedy made today. And I'm sure in retrospect; many critics who despised the films would feel guilty for having labeled "Pretty Woman" too straightforwardly as a banal and commercial romantic comedy. Rom-com, chick-flick, Cinderella story, feel-good story  cinematic jargon is rich of epithets to describe Garry Marshall's "Pretty Woman". Yet these words are too convenient and tend to veil the true poignancy and endearing chemistry between the two leads. Yes, we have the rich workaholic businessman with a disastrous sentimental life, meeting the streetwise hooker, with a heart of gold, but when played by Richard Gere and Julia Roberts whose shining smile illuminates the screen like a lamppost in Hollywood Boulevard, the film turns out to far better than some cynical minds might expect. At the end, I was left wondering: aren't the so-called stereotypes the names we give to obligatory plot devices when they're wrongly handled?

    I must admit that I find this movie one of the most offensive ever to come out of Hollywood. I can suspend disbelief, but this is ridiculous. Perhaps it is because I know too much about how this movie started, have lived in Hollywood myself and seen many documentaries on the real lives of prostitutes. The original script was intended as a very dark, cautionary tale about class warfare and prostitution in the Los Angeles area. It was then completely revamped as a high budget romantic comedy. As a result, it became one of the most successful box office movies of all time. First, while there are probably many handsome johns - they rarely are as good looking as Edward (Richard Gere). Nor are they as respectful. Well, maybe on one of those sugar baby websites. But that's different than picking up some random dude on the street like Vivian (Julia Roberts) did. After their first sexual encounter, Edward hires Vivian for the week to "escort" him to social events. So she's giving it up for a whole week for 3K? Maybe that was the going rate in 1990. He also gives her access to his credit cards. I suppose that could make up for it -- and maybe there are some guys who have done that before. Seems like a stupid move to trust a woman who takes sex for money. She could run those things up in no time, especially in a ridiculously expensive town like L.A. Vivian gets snubbed on Rodeo Drive. Well, that's believable, because anyone without their nose in the air gets snubbed there - street whore or not. But being snubbed at the hotel makes no sense. Many of those hotels make their living with high end prostitutes. Or at least bimbos who look like they are. Go to any fancy hotel and you will see decked out babes. Doesn't mean they're all whores -- but many of them look like they could be. I once found out in Vegas that many women who dressed up there were hookers. And I had a classy dress that revealed nothing - in fact, it wasn't even tight. So we are supposed to believe that Vivian isn't capable of buying a dress or using utensils at the dinner table? Sorry, she is not street enough to believe that. She looks like some chick who ran away from Nebraska - not a down and dirty Hollywood whore. Or course, Heidi Fleiss had a stable of classy looking chicks. But that's the point - a woman who looks like Roberts is usually part of a service, not someone hanging out on the street. I've heard that many johns like to tell their secrets and bare their souls to whores. So when Mr. Nice Guy reveals that he was estranged from his now dead father that could make sense. Because poor little Vivian was snubbed at the store, Edward comes to the rescue and takes her shopping. I think the most dangerous thing about this film is that even though it is rated R, plenty of young girls have seen it. Glamorizing prostitution in any way is irresponsible. Some prostitutes may have married one of her johns. But that's something that happens less than the chance of winning the lotto. Prostitution will always exist, but let's not make it out to be something it isn't. Sure, there are probably some happy hookers out there - but I've not met or heard of a single one. The truth is that most of the people I've seen or known of who have sex for money came from abuse, are on drugs or have very low self esteem. This whole movie is so phony and full of lies -- not even the ad is real. They used a body double because little miss goodie two shoes herself -- Julia Roberts - while willing to play a street hooker - not only refused to do nude scenes, but the movie poster legs aren't hers, either. Or maybe she didn't look as good in the photo. I rest my case -- this movie is just a disgrace. I will agree that it deserved to be nominated for an Oscar and win some awards -- because so many movies are contrived, complete and utter nonsense.

    Rom-coms are, generally speaking, not a great genre favourite of mine. It may be a tricky balance by having to have both comedy and romantic elements but there are a dozen examples I could name that fail on either one or both counts - "The Accidental Husband", "27 Dresses", "Fifty First Dates", "Never Been Kissed", "Bridget Jones: The Edge Of Reason" and so on. Being married, it is almost inevitable that I will watch a romantic comedy at some point but occasionally, she picks an absolute corker and I'm delighted to add this movie onto the 'good' pile. It might not be a realistic picture in any meaningful sense but as a pantomime, this is as good as it gets. Richard Gere plays corporate shark Edward Lewis, hugely rich and successful and visiting LA to seal his latest acquisition. His personal life, however, is a mess and after borrowing his lawyer-friend Philip Stuckey's (Jason Alexander) Lotus and getting lost in Beverly Hills, he meets hooker Vivian (Julia Roberts) and asks her for directions. Thus begins an unusual arrangement where Vivian agrees to spend the week as Edward's escort for $3000. While Edward struggles with his increasing attraction to Vivian, she struggles for acceptance amid the high-society she now finds herself in. Despite being a pumpkin short of being a straight-up adaptation of "Cinderella", "Pretty Woman" is an unashamed romantic flight of fancy fuelled by conversations about nothing in particular and long stares full of meaning. As a fable, it is a winner but as a serious character study, the film is found wanting. Roberts never convinces as a prostitute at any point in the film, looking far too clean-cut and well-fed although she has plenty of sass and her biting back at the snobs around her is quite amusing as are her scenes with Hector Elizondo's hotel manager. Gere, for his part, has little to do but seem distant but available which is exactly what he is. But we never seem to find out why he is the way he is other than being focused on his career. Instead, we get snippets of personality such as the scene at the piano but nothing to explain why he likes playing it to complete strangers. It's maddeningly short when it comes to the details but then you remind yourself (and indeed, the movie itself does) that this is "Cinderella" and like all fairy tales, they don't bear up to well to things like plot scrutiny. I never heard anyone voice the suggestion that Cinderella is the only person in the land with that particular shoe size... So this is one of those rare films where I can forgive the faults and just enjoy the damn thing. It isn't perfect - Roberts just isn't the right actress for the part and Gere needs a serious charisma transplant - but because it's a winning story, you can sit back and go with the flow. Whether its the romance with real chemistry from the leads or the battle-of-the-classes subplot, you buy into it in a way that most rom-coms can only dream of. Certainly my Better Half had that look on her face that said "Go on, girl!" during certain scenes, although she prefers "Dirty Dancing". I can see where she's coming from - that too has problems at its heart but the soundtrack just about rescues that film for me personally. This is much more enjoyable but whatever you do, don't take it seriously and don't question the plot too much.

    "Fifty bucks, Grandpa. For seventy-five, the wife can watch." - Kit I could write this review in the dark. I've seen Pretty Woman so many times, I cannot count. I take that back: I can count how many timesI saw it in the theatre. Back in Summer 1990  yes, months after this opened, I saw it for the first time, in an empty theatre, during an afternoon weekday. I didn't want to see it, but everyone including my beloved Aunt recommended it over and over. And over. And over. So, I caved. Six more viewings, including the last 2 on the same day, and I have had a record for me for one single movie unbroken since 1990. Yes, I saw Pretty Woman 7 times in the movie theatres. Obviously, I loved it back then. And still do. It's always like an old friend when I revisit this, albeit, one I can quote word for word, but still. Granted the movie's one singular flaw is that it's not the most original concept. For that, on my personal scientific scale of rating movies, it lost one single point bringing the overall score to 99/100. Rarely, on my list, will any movie even get above 95/100, let alone 99/100and only one got to 100/100. So, when I even state the word "flaw," I mean in the absolute smallest of ways. And besides, they address this with that one funny line: "What, you want me to name someone? You want like a name? Oh, God, the pressure of a name... I got it. Cindafuckin'rella!"  Kit Actually, come to think of it, there's dozens of funny lines, motions, scenes. I laugh as hard as I cry during each viewing. This movie is absolutely brilliant from beginning to end with its perfect balance of drama, comedy and romance. Emotionally beaten down Vivian (Julia Roberts  in a role that propelled her into space) had just recently begun streetwalking when she's picked up, initially for directions, by &uuml;ber-rich Edward Lewis (Richard Gere in a masterful performance) on Hollywood Boulevard. When it's realized she's a hooker with a heart and he's a hopeless romantic, they slowly begin a relationship, despite her being requested, um paid, to be at his "beck and call" for the remainder of his business trip in L.A. Of course, things are going to get complicated as roles are defined, and others have been thrown into the mix, but these two actors were so incredibly believable, so real and had so many genuine reactions and improved lines/scenes, you will fall hard for their romance. I've wanted to write this review of one of my all time favorite movies for quite some time. Sadly, I do not think, even with the countless (home) viewings, that I will do this movie justice. I will just say what's on my mind, and always on my mind when I see this: Fantastic lines, great pacing, deep romance, believable faces, one of the best soundtracks ever, also great score, real and fun. From beginning to end, I get involved and not just because I've seen it before; it's just a journey I love to get involved in and always pretend it's my first time. So much so, that I literally smile wide (like the absolutely stunning Roberts in this) when a scene comes up I didn't allow myself to recall. This has been, is and always will be one of my all-time favorite movies. It thoroughly improved on the old Cinderella story one-hundred times. And this version is absolutely timeless. Side Note: As mentioned above, I've seen this movie 7 times in the theatre and the last 2 of those, on the same day. Just to explain, I had the day off of school, and was to meet my friends at the now-defunct Valley West Mall's dollar theatre. Actually, it was Tuesday's 50 cent day. So, while waiting on my friends, who did not have the day off, I decided on seeing Pretty Woman for the sixth and final time during the early afternoon. Little did I know, they, too, wanted to see it, so I went to go with them to the same theatre screen, the same day, to see Pretty Woman a seventh time. Side Note II: Since I am a huge Superman fan, I wanted to break this 7x in the theatre record in 2006 with Superman Returns. Sadly, as much as I liked that movie (and wanted to more) I could only make it to 5 viewings. Here's to 2013's Man of Steel. I am going to try and break the record once more!

    Pretty Woman is a decent movie with a pretty simple,clich&eacute; story line,but there is a good cast.The movie is a chick flick,but they usually have some kind of conflict,Pretty Woman is just two hours of Richard Gere and Julia Roberts going to different places with each other and showing off how in love they are,although I did think both these actors gave their best to this simple,plain movie,and they definitely had good chemistry on set,and if it wasn't for their impressive acting,I would be giving this movie a much lower rating than 6. Edward Lewis (Richard Gere) falls in love with a prostitute (Julia Roberts) he meets at Beverly Hills and begins spoiling her with his wealth.

    watching this movie at night,pretty woman gives me some thinking and surprise.it is about personality.the compare between cold thinking and warm heart.a good movie. Roberts is sweet,the changing of her emotion in this film is the main topic.no matter happy or sorrow,it is all about falling in love.this film is better than dying young,the changing is more interesting,but the main actor is not handsome than the main actor in dying young though he is more reasonable.Roberts somehow always gives person kind of happy feeling,not sad.especially when she smiles.i will watch her other movies when i am free from doing my job.though she is getting old now .

    To maintain their wholesome image, Walt Disney Studios released "Pretty Woman" under the umbrella of their ancillary company, Touchstone Pictures. But "Pretty Woman", a feature film about a prostitute who turns into a princess after meeting a Californian prince, is no more sleazy than Disney's animated films aimed at children. The message, values and narrative arcs are all the same. The plot? Richard Gere plays a millionaire who's depressed because "his father doesn't love him". Disillusioned, he prepares to dismantle and downsize his giant corporate empire. Luckily he meets a hooker played by Julia Roberts. He showers her in money, riches and fine clothes, she teaches him to be a kind, good businessman who "provides jobs to shipbuilders". She rescues him from depression and "bad" capitalism, he rescues her from the slums, prostitution and, ergo, "bad" capitalism. The couple no longer screw people over, be it as prostitutes or as corporate raiders, but engage in "moral transactions". They get married, live happily ever after and he builds warships. Like "Indecent Proposal", released around the same time, the super-wealthy are initially malevolent but reveal themselves to be caring and decent. Prostitution is good, clean, profitable, fun and "just another career choice". Women, as prostitutes, make their own decisions and are entirely independent, strong and in control of their bodies and choices. Softcore titillation is used, and the prevailing aesthetic is one which bows down to wealth, riches, materialism and money. The end goal is always monogamous marital bliss, women gladly debase themselves to be with their wealthy providers and love conquers all difficulties and is constant. Furthermore, super-rich princes are the male ideal and hookers with hearts of gold are the female ideal. Prostitution has no serious consequences, prostitution is glorified and takes place between free women and sensitive guys, and monogamous marriage, capitalism, patriarchy, and commodification are all endorsed. Elsewhere expensive finery masks amorality, men mould women into their own little dolls, corruption is unimportant (because everyone is corrupt, everyone's a whore, and so corruption is relative), corporate raiders care about people other than themselves (members from the urban poor, no less) and disparages in wealth, taste, experience and education are both cute and don't thwart romance. Compare this to Francois Truffaut's "The Soft Skin", where the provincial mannerisms of a similar woman are mocked by her aristocratic lover. To make the film work, Big Business must be glorified as much as prostitution. Gere's a Prince Charming, climbing towers to rescue his lady. Oddly, the film is adored by women. It very much represents a post-feminist stance; as all female desire is celebrated, the fantasy of winning a rich prince is super cool, even if this first means that a woman must first unconsciously self-identify as a "whore". Servitute is embraced because the self is redefined as feminine-consumer, allowed to window-shop for any and all desires, which in this case is implicitly connected to women's magazines, the fashion industry and the disciplined use of makeup, clothing, exercise etc. Everyone can be transformed from working girl to lady of leisure, everyone is allowed to dream of being valuable and feel valued, everyone is trained in the art of seduction, self-marketing, sexual gratification and consumer display. 4/10 - "My Fair Lady" meets "Cinderella" meets "Pygmalion". Worth one viewing.

    I like Julia Roberts but this was such a step backward for women. Come on seriously how could anyone think of this as a romance?? There were so many clich&eacute;s in this movie I began to wonder if it was just one big commercial for male body spray like Axe. Where could a relationship like this go? They going to have children? Hey Mom how did you and Dad meet? Oh I was hooking down on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and your Dad gave me $100 to spend the night with him. Isn't that sooo romantic. Blech! Imagine every time they get into an argument and he tells her she is just hooker anyway and should be happy with what she's got. Although, this film was made in the 90's it must have been written in the 50's back when men had some crazy control issues and wished they could just keep women down...oh wait a minute how much has really changed since then? This film is less of a Cinderella story for hookers and more of a Cinderfella story for "Johns".

    "Pretty Woman" is a lightweight but entertaining fairy tale about Prince Charming. Everything about director Garry Marshall's upbeat romantic comedy is as contrived as it is sugar coated from subversion of any sort. Although it received an R rating, this sappy two hour plus love story shows what happens to a handsome but heartless Wall Street titan when he encounters a savvy street prostitute in Beverly Hills and how their lives change radically for the better. Despite its predictable plot, "Pretty Woman" wins us over with the chemistry and charisma of the principals. Richard Gere plays protagonist Edward Lewis with wisdom and suavity. He is a businessman who buys companies and then breaks them up and sells them off. Consequently, the milk of human kindness doesn't flow in his blood. Sheer coincidence brings our hero face to face with the heroine, young but gorgeous, and "Pretty Woman" charts their fate together. Reportedly, scenarist J.T. Lawton's original script emphasized gutter realism over utter unreality. Marshall and his writers have sanded off all the rough edges. Our hero is in Los Angles when he discovers that his girlfriend is about to ditch him. He tries to drive a Lotus Esprit and nearly wrecks it. Kit and Vivian are prowling their share of the sidewalk when Edward cruises up and parks. Of course, he hasn't so much parked as jammed his car up so he cannot get it to run. He inquires for directions for Beverley Hills from her. He asks her afterward if she can drive the Lotus. They wind up at his Beverley Hills hotel and Edward buys Vivian for the night and then the week. He shells out thousands of dollars to get Vivian a proper wardrobe so she can accompany him in public and appear presentable. Chiefly, Edward wants to buy out a company that makes ships and sell it off, but the owner-founder, James Morse (Ralph Bellamy of "The Professionals") refuses to bow out without a fight. Edward did not have a good relationship with his own father Carson. Indeed, when Carter died, neither had spoken to each other in 14 and a half years. Initially, Edward savors the process of carving up Morse's company until he begins to see him as a human. Richard Gere and Julia Roberts make Edward and Vivian very palatable, very sexy, and very sympathetic. The happily ever after ending is contrived. Interestingly, the two principals move onto to better things. Ostensibly, Jason Alexander is delivers the best performance as Edward's cutthroat attorney, Philip Stuckey, who has been with him ten years. Philip's abrasive treatment of Vivian alienates Edward and he fires Philip. Hector Elizondo has a memorable supporting role as the hotel manager who helps Vivian with her wardrobe. There isn't a single character in this romantic comedy that has any depth or subtlety. Marshall relies on wardrobe to define his characters and neither the protagonist nor the heroine is ever in jeopardy. The Beverly Hills shopping scene when our heroine returns to Rodeo Driver is amusing. The people who made this diverting epic create characters that you find yourself rooting for and liking and the villains get their comeuppance.

    Calling this movie a romance is pretty much a disgrace. Let's not forget something. The heroine is a hooker! The hooker with the heart of gold! Please! I don't buy at all that Richard Gere, as a millionaire or even a $40,000 a year salesman, would fall in love with the hooker, Julia Roberts. First of all, Julia Roberts isn't all that hot. It's hard to even call her "pretty", the first word in the tittle of the movie. She's not ugly, but she's just a little above average, bordering on pretty. That aside, stud millionaires do not fall in love with hookers. They might pay one from time to time, but they don't fall in love them. The whole premise of this movie is idiotic, so the movie is unsuccessful to me as a whole. All that aside, Gere was very good in the film, and Roberts acting was also very good. The movie had outstanding production value and certain characters, like the one played by Jason Alexander, were interesting. So, as a total score, I give Pretty Woman a five.

    This is from Roy Orbinson 1964's hit song that reached its cinematic posterity 26 years later, with Garry Marshall's film of the same name. Oddly enough, when taken in the context of the film, the lyrics take a totally different significance since the titular 'pretty woman' doesn't quite walk on the streets for pleasure. Of course, the song is used for the film's trademark sequence when Vivian tries new clothes from prestigious French sounding shops, fulfilling every little girl's fantasy. But there's something genuinely appealing in Julia Robert's performance, a sort of child-like eagerness to embrace a one-week dream and do whatever she wants because she got woman's most cherished accessory, not a handbag, not a lipstick or a mirror, but a credit card. Don't take that statement as patronizing and misogynistic please, "Sex and the City" convey the same message, and bluntly assumes it. What differentiates Vivian from the other feminist icons though relies on the roots of her constant enthusiasm, forever incarnated by Robert's unique smile  and irresistible giggles. Indeed, no matter how much fun she has while seizing her luxurious days, we know that she's happy, more than anything, because she's in love. And the man might be rich, handsome and powerful, like a modernization of the 'Charming Prince' figure, there's something that oddly rings true in that peculiar love story. And this is a credit to two fine performances from Julia Roberts and Richard Gere, and a clever screenplay that doesn't take its premise for granted, starting from the obligatory meeting, which is the hit-or-miss of romantic comedies. Gere is Edward Lewis, he can't drive a friend's car and find his way to the hotel, he meets a prostitute named Vivian, she's not only attractive, but she's smart. She knows about car and end up driving him to the hotel. So, when he invites for just one night, that will turns into one week, plot-wise, the machine is working. "I want the fairy tale" she admits later, with an innocence that sweeps off all the dirt that has tarnished her life since she started walking on the streets. Never in the film, had she felt more sincere and more naively appealing. All little girls want the fairy tale, and that quote, if one thing, highlights the fact there still is that 'little girl' sparkle in Vivian's eyes, and her profession is only a logical consequence to unfortunate circumstances. But the film doesn't fall in the patronizing trap either, Vivian needs Edwards, but so does he. There's a clever parallel established by these two people's jobs, Edward buys out companies facing economic difficulties, to sell parts of them and make more profits. As she says, both screw people for money, and Edward is no more honorable than Vivian. Both hearts reflect the other's truth, that's the mark of true love and that's exactly what happens to Edward and Vivian. There's a nice subplot involving one company Edward doesn't want to buy because he likes its chairman, who's a sort of fatherly figure, wonderfully played by Ralph Bellamy, and it's only after his experience with Vivian that he realizes he doesn't enjoy his job as she did and might have chosen the wrong path for some obscure Oedipal reasons. Vivian, didn't embrace her career with more passion either, but maybe she kept on hoping of a real love, one that would be incarnated by the only thing she couldn't give her customers: a kiss. And the pay-off comes when she tenderly kisses a sleeping Edward in the mouth, at that point, we know she loves him. "Pretty Woman" doesn't overplay the whole Pygmalion-theme, that one is handled by Hector Elizondo, the hotel manager who, from despising Vivian, grows fond on her and teaches her how to properly behave. But the film doesn't use their archetypes for the sake of cheap laughs, it doesn't need to, Roberts is hilarious because she stays natural in a world she doesn't belong to, and never condescending either, Edward is inspired by her spontaneity, something that cruelly lacks in his work of sophistication and cynical materialism, incarnated by his friend and lawyer, played by Joe Constanza. Constanza, as the only true antagonist of the film, is responsible of one of the film's saddest parts, after Gere comforted him that Vivian wasn't a spy. After being approached like a cheap prostitute, you could feel she was truly hurt by Edward's betrayal. And this is what the film is about, two persons who don't want to be reduced to condescending label, one in the highest, and another in the lowest extreme. Being treated like a prostitute is the ultimate insult for Vivian because it totally negates her struggle to let her personality finally bloom, as Edward knows he's not that rich prick who only thinks in green bills. It's all about becoming yourself. I don't intend to make the film sound like an existential journey; it's still a heart-warming comedy but more intelligent and subtle than any comedy made today. And I'm sure in retrospect; many critics who despised the films would feel guilty for having labeled "Pretty Woman" too straightforwardly as a banal and commercial romantic comedy. Rom-com, chick-flick, Cinderella story, feel-good story  cinematic jargon is rich of epithets to describe Garry Marshall's "Pretty Woman". Yet these words are too convenient and tend to veil the true poignancy and endearing chemistry between the two leads. Yes, we have the rich workaholic businessman with a disastrous sentimental life, meeting the streetwise hooker, with a heart of gold, but when played by Richard Gere and Julia Roberts whose shining smile illuminates the screen like a lamppost in Hollywood Boulevard, the film turns out to far better than some cynical minds might expect. At the end, I was left wondering: aren't the so-called stereotypes the names we give to obligatory plot devices when they're wrongly handled?

    I must admit that I find this movie one of the most offensive ever to come out of Hollywood. I can suspend disbelief, but this is ridiculous. Perhaps it is because I know too much about how this movie started, have lived in Hollywood myself and seen many documentaries on the real lives of prostitutes. The original script was intended as a very dark, cautionary tale about class warfare and prostitution in the Los Angeles area. It was then completely revamped as a high budget romantic comedy. As a result, it became one of the most successful box office movies of all time. First, while there are probably many handsome johns - they rarely are as good looking as Edward (Richard Gere). Nor are they as respectful. Well, maybe on one of those sugar baby websites. But that's different than picking up some random dude on the street like Vivian (Julia Roberts) did. After their first sexual encounter, Edward hires Vivian for the week to "escort" him to social events. So she's giving it up for a whole week for 3K? Maybe that was the going rate in 1990. He also gives her access to his credit cards. I suppose that could make up for it -- and maybe there are some guys who have done that before. Seems like a stupid move to trust a woman who takes sex for money. She could run those things up in no time, especially in a ridiculously expensive town like L.A. Vivian gets snubbed on Rodeo Drive. Well, that's believable, because anyone without their nose in the air gets snubbed there - street whore or not. But being snubbed at the hotel makes no sense. Many of those hotels make their living with high end prostitutes. Or at least bimbos who look like they are. Go to any fancy hotel and you will see decked out babes. Doesn't mean they're all whores -- but many of them look like they could be. I once found out in Vegas that many women who dressed up there were hookers. And I had a classy dress that revealed nothing - in fact, it wasn't even tight. So we are supposed to believe that Vivian isn't capable of buying a dress or using utensils at the dinner table? Sorry, she is not street enough to believe that. She looks like some chick who ran away from Nebraska - not a down and dirty Hollywood whore. Or course, Heidi Fleiss had a stable of classy looking chicks. But that's the point - a woman who looks like Roberts is usually part of a service, not someone hanging out on the street. I've heard that many johns like to tell their secrets and bare their souls to whores. So when Mr. Nice Guy reveals that he was estranged from his now dead father that could make sense. Because poor little Vivian was snubbed at the store, Edward comes to the rescue and takes her shopping. I think the most dangerous thing about this film is that even though it is rated R, plenty of young girls have seen it. Glamorizing prostitution in any way is irresponsible. Some prostitutes may have married one of her johns. But that's something that happens less than the chance of winning the lotto. Prostitution will always exist, but let's not make it out to be something it isn't. Sure, there are probably some happy hookers out there - but I've not met or heard of a single one. The truth is that most of the people I've seen or known of who have sex for money came from abuse, are on drugs or have very low self esteem. This whole movie is so phony and full of lies -- not even the ad is real. They used a body double because little miss goodie two shoes herself -- Julia Roberts - while willing to play a street hooker - not only refused to do nude scenes, but the movie poster legs aren't hers, either. Or maybe she didn't look as good in the photo. I rest my case -- this movie is just a disgrace. I will agree that it deserved to be nominated for an Oscar and win some awards -- because so many movies are contrived, complete and utter nonsense.

    Rom-coms are, generally speaking, not a great genre favourite of mine. It may be a tricky balance by having to have both comedy and romantic elements but there are a dozen examples I could name that fail on either one or both counts - "The Accidental Husband", "27 Dresses", "Fifty First Dates", "Never Been Kissed", "Bridget Jones: The Edge Of Reason" and so on. Being married, it is almost inevitable that I will watch a romantic comedy at some point but occasionally, she picks an absolute corker and I'm delighted to add this movie onto the 'good' pile. It might not be a realistic picture in any meaningful sense but as a pantomime, this is as good as it gets. Richard Gere plays corporate shark Edward Lewis, hugely rich and successful and visiting LA to seal his latest acquisition. His personal life, however, is a mess and after borrowing his lawyer-friend Philip Stuckey's (Jason Alexander) Lotus and getting lost in Beverly Hills, he meets hooker Vivian (Julia Roberts) and asks her for directions. Thus begins an unusual arrangement where Vivian agrees to spend the week as Edward's escort for $3000. While Edward struggles with his increasing attraction to Vivian, she struggles for acceptance amid the high-society she now finds herself in. Despite being a pumpkin short of being a straight-up adaptation of "Cinderella", "Pretty Woman" is an unashamed romantic flight of fancy fuelled by conversations about nothing in particular and long stares full of meaning. As a fable, it is a winner but as a serious character study, the film is found wanting. Roberts never convinces as a prostitute at any point in the film, looking far too clean-cut and well-fed although she has plenty of sass and her biting back at the snobs around her is quite amusing as are her scenes with Hector Elizondo's hotel manager. Gere, for his part, has little to do but seem distant but available which is exactly what he is. But we never seem to find out why he is the way he is other than being focused on his career. Instead, we get snippets of personality such as the scene at the piano but nothing to explain why he likes playing it to complete strangers. It's maddeningly short when it comes to the details but then you remind yourself (and indeed, the movie itself does) that this is "Cinderella" and like all fairy tales, they don't bear up to well to things like plot scrutiny. I never heard anyone voice the suggestion that Cinderella is the only person in the land with that particular shoe size... So this is one of those rare films where I can forgive the faults and just enjoy the damn thing. It isn't perfect - Roberts just isn't the right actress for the part and Gere needs a serious charisma transplant - but because it's a winning story, you can sit back and go with the flow. Whether its the romance with real chemistry from the leads or the battle-of-the-classes subplot, you buy into it in a way that most rom-coms can only dream of. Certainly my Better Half had that look on her face that said "Go on, girl!" during certain scenes, although she prefers "Dirty Dancing". I can see where she's coming from - that too has problems at its heart but the soundtrack just about rescues that film for me personally. This is much more enjoyable but whatever you do, don't take it seriously and don't question the plot too much.

    "Fifty bucks, Grandpa. For seventy-five, the wife can watch." - Kit I could write this review in the dark. I've seen Pretty Woman so many times, I cannot count. I take that back: I can count how many timesI saw it in the theatre. Back in Summer 1990  yes, months after this opened, I saw it for the first time, in an empty theatre, during an afternoon weekday. I didn't want to see it, but everyone including my beloved Aunt recommended it over and over. And over. And over. So, I caved. Six more viewings, including the last 2 on the same day, and I have had a record for me for one single movie unbroken since 1990. Yes, I saw Pretty Woman 7 times in the movie theatres. Obviously, I loved it back then. And still do. It's always like an old friend when I revisit this, albeit, one I can quote word for word, but still. Granted the movie's one singular flaw is that it's not the most original concept. For that, on my personal scientific scale of rating movies, it lost one single point bringing the overall score to 99/100. Rarely, on my list, will any movie even get above 95/100, let alone 99/100and only one got to 100/100. So, when I even state the word "flaw," I mean in the absolute smallest of ways. And besides, they address this with that one funny line: "What, you want me to name someone? You want like a name? Oh, God, the pressure of a name... I got it. Cindafuckin'rella!"  Kit Actually, come to think of it, there's dozens of funny lines, motions, scenes. I laugh as hard as I cry during each viewing. This movie is absolutely brilliant from beginning to end with its perfect balance of drama, comedy and romance. Emotionally beaten down Vivian (Julia Roberts  in a role that propelled her into space) had just recently begun streetwalking when she's picked up, initially for directions, by &uuml;ber-rich Edward Lewis (Richard Gere in a masterful performance) on Hollywood Boulevard. When it's realized she's a hooker with a heart and he's a hopeless romantic, they slowly begin a relationship, despite her being requested, um paid, to be at his "beck and call" for the remainder of his business trip in L.A. Of course, things are going to get complicated as roles are defined, and others have been thrown into the mix, but these two actors were so incredibly believable, so real and had so many genuine reactions and improved lines/scenes, you will fall hard for their romance. I've wanted to write this review of one of my all time favorite movies for quite some time. Sadly, I do not think, even with the countless (home) viewings, that I will do this movie justice. I will just say what's on my mind, and always on my mind when I see this: Fantastic lines, great pacing, deep romance, believable faces, one of the best soundtracks ever, also great score, real and fun. From beginning to end, I get involved and not just because I've seen it before; it's just a journey I love to get involved in and always pretend it's my first time. So much so, that I literally smile wide (like the absolutely stunning Roberts in this) when a scene comes up I didn't allow myself to recall. This has been, is and always will be one of my all-time favorite movies. It thoroughly improved on the old Cinderella story one-hundred times. And this version is absolutely timeless. Side Note: As mentioned above, I've seen this movie 7 times in the theatre and the last 2 of those, on the same day. Just to explain, I had the day off of school, and was to meet my friends at the now-defunct Valley West Mall's dollar theatre. Actually, it was Tuesday's 50 cent day. So, while waiting on my friends, who did not have the day off, I decided on seeing Pretty Woman for the sixth and final time during the early afternoon. Little did I know, they, too, wanted to see it, so I went to go with them to the same theatre screen, the same day, to see Pretty Woman a seventh time. Side Note II: Since I am a huge Superman fan, I wanted to break this 7x in the theatre record in 2006 with Superman Returns. Sadly, as much as I liked that movie (and wanted to more) I could only make it to 5 viewings. Here's to 2013's Man of Steel. I am going to try and break the record once more!

    Pretty Woman is a decent movie with a pretty simple,clich&eacute; story line,but there is a good cast.The movie is a chick flick,but they usually have some kind of conflict,Pretty Woman is just two hours of Richard Gere and Julia Roberts going to different places with each other and showing off how in love they are,although I did think both these actors gave their best to this simple,plain movie,and they definitely had good chemistry on set,and if it wasn't for their impressive acting,I would be giving this movie a much lower rating than 6. Edward Lewis (Richard Gere) falls in love with a prostitute (Julia Roberts) he meets at Beverly Hills and begins spoiling her with his wealth.

    watching this movie at night,pretty woman gives me some thinking and surprise.it is about personality.the compare between cold thinking and warm heart.a good movie. Roberts is sweet,the changing of her emotion in this film is the main topic.no matter happy or sorrow,it is all about falling in love.this film is better than dying young,the changing is more interesting,but the main actor is not handsome than the main actor in dying young though he is more reasonable.Roberts somehow always gives person kind of happy feeling,not sad.especially when she smiles.i will watch her other movies when i am free from doing my job.though she is getting old now .

    To maintain their wholesome image, Walt Disney Studios released "Pretty Woman" under the umbrella of their ancillary company, Touchstone Pictures. But "Pretty Woman", a feature film about a prostitute who turns into a princess after meeting a Californian prince, is no more sleazy than Disney's animated films aimed at children. The message, values and narrative arcs are all the same. The plot? Richard Gere plays a millionaire who's depressed because "his father doesn't love him". Disillusioned, he prepares to dismantle and downsize his giant corporate empire. Luckily he meets a hooker played by Julia Roberts. He showers her in money, riches and fine clothes, she teaches him to be a kind, good businessman who "provides jobs to shipbuilders". She rescues him from depression and "bad" capitalism, he rescues her from the slums, prostitution and, ergo, "bad" capitalism. The couple no longer screw people over, be it as prostitutes or as corporate raiders, but engage in "moral transactions". They get married, live happily ever after and he builds warships. Like "Indecent Proposal", released around the same time, the super-wealthy are initially malevolent but reveal themselves to be caring and decent. Prostitution is good, clean, profitable, fun and "just another career choice". Women, as prostitutes, make their own decisions and are entirely independent, strong and in control of their bodies and choices. Softcore titillation is used, and the prevailing aesthetic is one which bows down to wealth, riches, materialism and money. The end goal is always monogamous marital bliss, women gladly debase themselves to be with their wealthy providers and love conquers all difficulties and is constant. Furthermore, super-rich princes are the male ideal and hookers with hearts of gold are the female ideal. Prostitution has no serious consequences, prostitution is glorified and takes place between free women and sensitive guys, and monogamous marriage, capitalism, patriarchy, and commodification are all endorsed. Elsewhere expensive finery masks amorality, men mould women into their own little dolls, corruption is unimportant (because everyone is corrupt, everyone's a whore, and so corruption is relative), corporate raiders care about people other than themselves (members from the urban poor, no less) and disparages in wealth, taste, experience and education are both cute and don't thwart romance. Compare this to Francois Truffaut's "The Soft Skin", where the provincial mannerisms of a similar woman are mocked by her aristocratic lover. To make the film work, Big Business must be glorified as much as prostitution. Gere's a Prince Charming, climbing towers to rescue his lady. Oddly, the film is adored by women. It very much represents a post-feminist stance; as all female desire is celebrated, the fantasy of winning a rich prince is super cool, even if this first means that a woman must first unconsciously self-identify as a "whore". Servitute is embraced because the self is redefined as feminine-consumer, allowed to window-shop for any and all desires, which in this case is implicitly connected to women's magazines, the fashion industry and the disciplined use of makeup, clothing, exercise etc. Everyone can be transformed from working girl to lady of leisure, everyone is allowed to dream of being valuable and feel valued, everyone is trained in the art of seduction, self-marketing, sexual gratification and consumer display. 4/10 - "My Fair Lady" meets "Cinderella" meets "Pygmalion". Worth one viewing.

    I like Julia Roberts but this was such a step backward for women. Come on seriously how could anyone think of this as a romance?? There were so many clich&eacute;s in this movie I began to wonder if it was just one big commercial for male body spray like Axe. Where could a relationship like this go? They going to have children? Hey Mom how did you and Dad meet? Oh I was hooking down on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and your Dad gave me $100 to spend the night with him. Isn't that sooo romantic. Blech! Imagine every time they get into an argument and he tells her she is just hooker anyway and should be happy with what she's got. Although, this film was made in the 90's it must have been written in the 50's back when men had some crazy control issues and wished they could just keep women down...oh wait a minute how much has really changed since then? This film is less of a Cinderella story for hookers and more of a Cinderfella story for "Johns".

    "Pretty Woman" is a lightweight but entertaining fairy tale about Prince Charming. Everything about director Garry Marshall's upbeat romantic comedy is as contrived as it is sugar coated from subversion of any sort. Although it received an R rating, this sappy two hour plus love story shows what happens to a handsome but heartless Wall Street titan when he encounters a savvy street prostitute in Beverly Hills and how their lives change radically for the better. Despite its predictable plot, "Pretty Woman" wins us over with the chemistry and charisma of the principals. Richard Gere plays protagonist Edward Lewis with wisdom and suavity. He is a businessman who buys companies and then breaks them up and sells them off. Consequently, the milk of human kindness doesn't flow in his blood. Sheer coincidence brings our hero face to face with the heroine, young but gorgeous, and "Pretty Woman" charts their fate together. Reportedly, scenarist J.T. Lawton's original script emphasized gutter realism over utter unreality. Marshall and his writers have sanded off all the rough edges. Our hero is in Los Angles when he discovers that his girlfriend is about to ditch him. He tries to drive a Lotus Esprit and nearly wrecks it. Kit and Vivian are prowling their share of the sidewalk when Edward cruises up and parks. Of course, he hasn't so much parked as jammed his car up so he cannot get it to run. He inquires for directions for Beverley Hills from her. He asks her afterward if she can drive the Lotus. They wind up at his Beverley Hills hotel and Edward buys Vivian for the night and then the week. He shells out thousands of dollars to get Vivian a proper wardrobe so she can accompany him in public and appear presentable. Chiefly, Edward wants to buy out a company that makes ships and sell it off, but the owner-founder, James Morse (Ralph Bellamy of "The Professionals") refuses to bow out without a fight. Edward did not have a good relationship with his own father Carson. Indeed, when Carter died, neither had spoken to each other in 14 and a half years. Initially, Edward savors the process of carving up Morse's company until he begins to see him as a human. Richard Gere and Julia Roberts make Edward and Vivian very palatable, very sexy, and very sympathetic. The happily ever after ending is contrived. Interestingly, the two principals move onto to better things. Ostensibly, Jason Alexander is delivers the best performance as Edward's cutthroat attorney, Philip Stuckey, who has been with him ten years. Philip's abrasive treatment of Vivian alienates Edward and he fires Philip. Hector Elizondo has a memorable supporting role as the hotel manager who helps Vivian with her wardrobe. There isn't a single character in this romantic comedy that has any depth or subtlety. Marshall relies on wardrobe to define his characters and neither the protagonist nor the heroine is ever in jeopardy. The Beverly Hills shopping scene when our heroine returns to Rodeo Driver is amusing. The people who made this diverting epic create characters that you find yourself rooting for and liking and the villains get their comeuppance.

    Calling this movie a romance is pretty much a disgrace. Let's not forget something. The heroine is a hooker! The hooker with the heart of gold! Please! I don't buy at all that Richard Gere, as a millionaire or even a $40,000 a year salesman, would fall in love with the hooker, Julia Roberts. First of all, Julia Roberts isn't all that hot. It's hard to even call her "pretty", the first word in the tittle of the movie. She's not ugly, but she's just a little above average, bordering on pretty. That aside, stud millionaires do not fall in love with hookers. They might pay one from time to time, but they don't fall in love them. The whole premise of this movie is idiotic, so the movie is unsuccessful to me as a whole. All that aside, Gere was very good in the film, and Roberts acting was also very good. The movie had outstanding production value and certain characters, like the one played by Jason Alexander, were interesting. So, as a total score, I give Pretty Woman a five.

    This is from Roy Orbinson 1964's hit song that reached its cinematic posterity 26 years later, with Garry Marshall's film of the same name. Oddly enough, when taken in the context of the film, the lyrics take a totally different significance since the titular 'pretty woman' doesn't quite walk on the streets for pleasure. Of course, the song is used for the film's trademark sequence when Vivian tries new clothes from prestigious French sounding shops, fulfilling every little girl's fantasy. But there's something genuinely appealing in Julia Robert's performance, a sort of child-like eagerness to embrace a one-week dream and do whatever she wants because she got woman's most cherished accessory, not a handbag, not a lipstick or a mirror, but a credit card. Don't take that statement as patronizing and misogynistic please, "Sex and the City" convey the same message, and bluntly assumes it. What differentiates Vivian from the other feminist icons though relies on the roots of her constant enthusiasm, forever incarnated by Robert's unique smile  and irresistible giggles. Indeed, no matter how much fun she has while seizing her luxurious days, we know that she's happy, more than anything, because she's in love. And the man might be rich, handsome and powerful, like a modernization of the 'Charming Prince' figure, there's something that oddly rings true in that peculiar love story. And this is a credit to two fine performances from Julia Roberts and Richard Gere, and a clever screenplay that doesn't take its premise for granted, starting from the obligatory meeting, which is the hit-or-miss of romantic comedies. Gere is Edward Lewis, he can't drive a friend's car and find his way to the hotel, he meets a prostitute named Vivian, she's not only attractive, but she's smart. She knows about car and end up driving him to the hotel. So, when he invites for just one night, that will turns into one week, plot-wise, the machine is working. "I want the fairy tale" she admits later, with an innocence that sweeps off all the dirt that has tarnished her life since she started walking on the streets. Never in the film, had she felt more sincere and more naively appealing. All little girls want the fairy tale, and that quote, if one thing, highlights the fact there still is that 'little girl' sparkle in Vivian's eyes, and her profession is only a logical consequence to unfortunate circumstances. But the film doesn't fall in the patronizing trap either, Vivian needs Edwards, but so does he. There's a clever parallel established by these two people's jobs, Edward buys out companies facing economic difficulties, to sell parts of them and make more profits. As she says, both screw people for money, and Edward is no more honorable than Vivian. Both hearts reflect the other's truth, that's the mark of true love and that's exactly what happens to Edward and Vivian. There's a nice subplot involving one company Edward doesn't want to buy because he likes its chairman, who's a sort of fatherly figure, wonderfully played by Ralph Bellamy, and it's only after his experience with Vivian that he realizes he doesn't enjoy his job as she did and might have chosen the wrong path for some obscure Oedipal reasons. Vivian, didn't embrace her career with more passion either, but maybe she kept on hoping of a real love, one that would be incarnated by the only thing she couldn't give her customers: a kiss. And the pay-off comes when she tenderly kisses a sleeping Edward in the mouth, at that point, we know she loves him. "Pretty Woman" doesn't overplay the whole Pygmalion-theme, that one is handled by Hector Elizondo, the hotel manager who, from despising Vivian, grows fond on her and teaches her how to properly behave. But the film doesn't use their archetypes for the sake of cheap laughs, it doesn't need to, Roberts is hilarious because she stays natural in a world she doesn't belong to, and never condescending either, Edward is inspired by her spontaneity, something that cruelly lacks in his work of sophistication and cynical materialism, incarnated by his friend and lawyer, played by Joe Constanza. Constanza, as the only true antagonist of the film, is responsible of one of the film's saddest parts, after Gere comforted him that Vivian wasn't a spy. After being approached like a cheap prostitute, you could feel she was truly hurt by Edward's betrayal. And this is what the film is about, two persons who don't want to be reduced to condescending label, one in the highest, and another in the lowest extreme. Being treated like a prostitute is the ultimate insult for Vivian because it totally negates her struggle to let her personality finally bloom, as Edward knows he's not that rich prick who only thinks in green bills. It's all about becoming yourself. I don't intend to make the film sound like an existential journey; it's still a heart-warming comedy but more intelligent and subtle than any comedy made today. And I'm sure in retrospect; many critics who despised the films would feel guilty for having labeled "Pretty Woman" too straightforwardly as a banal and commercial romantic comedy. Rom-com, chick-flick, Cinderella story, feel-good story  cinematic jargon is rich of epithets to describe Garry Marshall's "Pretty Woman". Yet these words are too convenient and tend to veil the true poignancy and endearing chemistry between the two leads. Yes, we have the rich workaholic businessman with a disastrous sentimental life, meeting the streetwise hooker, with a heart of gold, but when played by Richard Gere and Julia Roberts whose shining smile illuminates the screen like a lamppost in Hollywood Boulevard, the film turns out to far better than some cynical minds might expect. At the end, I was left wondering: aren't the so-called stereotypes the names we give to obligatory plot devices when they're wrongly handled?

    I must admit that I find this movie one of the most offensive ever to come out of Hollywood. I can suspend disbelief, but this is ridiculous. Perhaps it is because I know too much about how this movie started, have lived in Hollywood myself and seen many documentaries on the real lives of prostitutes. The original script was intended as a very dark, cautionary tale about class warfare and prostitution in the Los Angeles area. It was then completely revamped as a high budget romantic comedy. As a result, it became one of the most successful box office movies of all time. First, while there are probably many handsome johns - they rarely are as good looking as Edward (Richard Gere). Nor are they as respectful. Well, maybe on one of those sugar baby websites. But that's different than picking up some random dude on the street like Vivian (Julia Roberts) did. After their first sexual encounter, Edward hires Vivian for the week to "escort" him to social events. So she's giving it up for a whole week for 3K? Maybe that was the going rate in 1990. He also gives her access to his credit cards. I suppose that could make up for it -- and maybe there are some guys who have done that before. Seems like a stupid move to trust a woman who takes sex for money. She could run those things up in no time, especially in a ridiculously expensive town like L.A. Vivian gets snubbed on Rodeo Drive. Well, that's believable, because anyone without their nose in the air gets snubbed there - street whore or not. But being snubbed at the hotel makes no sense. Many of those hotels make their living with high end prostitutes. Or at least bimbos who look like they are. Go to any fancy hotel and you will see decked out babes. Doesn't mean they're all whores -- but many of them look like they could be. I once found out in Vegas that many women who dressed up there were hookers. And I had a classy dress that revealed nothing - in fact, it wasn't even tight. So we are supposed to believe that Vivian isn't capable of buying a dress or using utensils at the dinner table? Sorry, she is not street enough to believe that. She looks like some chick who ran away from Nebraska - not a down and dirty Hollywood whore. Or course, Heidi Fleiss had a stable of classy looking chicks. But that's the point - a woman who looks like Roberts is usually part of a service, not someone hanging out on the street. I've heard that many johns like to tell their secrets and bare their souls to whores. So when Mr. Nice Guy reveals that he was estranged from his now dead father that could make sense. Because poor little Vivian was snubbed at the store, Edward comes to the rescue and takes her shopping. I think the most dangerous thing about this film is that even though it is rated R, plenty of young girls have seen it. Glamorizing prostitution in any way is irresponsible. Some prostitutes may have married one of her johns. But that's something that happens less than the chance of winning the lotto. Prostitution will always exist, but let's not make it out to be something it isn't. Sure, there are probably some happy hookers out there - but I've not met or heard of a single one. The truth is that most of the people I've seen or known of who have sex for money came from abuse, are on drugs or have very low self esteem. This whole movie is so phony and full of lies -- not even the ad is real. They used a body double because little miss goodie two shoes herself -- Julia Roberts - while willing to play a street hooker - not only refused to do nude scenes, but the movie poster legs aren't hers, either. Or maybe she didn't look as good in the photo. I rest my case -- this movie is just a disgrace. I will agree that it deserved to be nominated for an Oscar and win some awards -- because so many movies are contrived, complete and utter nonsense.

    Rom-coms are, generally speaking, not a great genre favourite of mine. It may be a tricky balance by having to have both comedy and romantic elements but there are a dozen examples I could name that fail on either one or both counts - "The Accidental Husband", "27 Dresses", "Fifty First Dates", "Never Been Kissed", "Bridget Jones: The Edge Of Reason" and so on. Being married, it is almost inevitable that I will watch a romantic comedy at some point but occasionally, she picks an absolute corker and I'm delighted to add this movie onto the 'good' pile. It might not be a realistic picture in any meaningful sense but as a pantomime, this is as good as it gets. Richard Gere plays corporate shark Edward Lewis, hugely rich and successful and visiting LA to seal his latest acquisition. His personal life, however, is a mess and after borrowing his lawyer-friend Philip Stuckey's (Jason Alexander) Lotus and getting lost in Beverly Hills, he meets hooker Vivian (Julia Roberts) and asks her for directions. Thus begins an unusual arrangement where Vivian agrees to spend the week as Edward's escort for $3000. While Edward struggles with his increasing attraction to Vivian, she struggles for acceptance amid the high-society she now finds herself in. Despite being a pumpkin short of being a straight-up adaptation of "Cinderella", "Pretty Woman" is an unashamed romantic flight of fancy fuelled by conversations about nothing in particular and long stares full of meaning. As a fable, it is a winner but as a serious character study, the film is found wanting. Roberts never convinces as a prostitute at any point in the film, looking far too clean-cut and well-fed although she has plenty of sass and her biting back at the snobs around her is quite amusing as are her scenes with Hector Elizondo's hotel manager. Gere, for his part, has little to do but seem distant but available which is exactly what he is. But we never seem to find out why he is the way he is other than being focused on his career. Instead, we get snippets of personality such as the scene at the piano but nothing to explain why he likes playing it to complete strangers. It's maddeningly short when it comes to the details but then you remind yourself (and indeed, the movie itself does) that this is "Cinderella" and like all fairy tales, they don't bear up to well to things like plot scrutiny. I never heard anyone voice the suggestion that Cinderella is the only person in the land with that particular shoe size... So this is one of those rare films where I can forgive the faults and just enjoy the damn thing. It isn't perfect - Roberts just isn't the right actress for the part and Gere needs a serious charisma transplant - but because it's a winning story, you can sit back and go with the flow. Whether its the romance with real chemistry from the leads or the battle-of-the-classes subplot, you buy into it in a way that most rom-coms can only dream of. Certainly my Better Half had that look on her face that said "Go on, girl!" during certain scenes, although she prefers "Dirty Dancing". I can see where she's coming from - that too has problems at its heart but the soundtrack just about rescues that film for me personally. This is much more enjoyable but whatever you do, don't take it seriously and don't question the plot too much.

    "Fifty bucks, Grandpa. For seventy-five, the wife can watch." - Kit I could write this review in the dark. I've seen Pretty Woman so many times, I cannot count. I take that back: I can count how many timesI saw it in the theatre. Back in Summer 1990  yes, months after this opened, I saw it for the first time, in an empty theatre, during an afternoon weekday. I didn't want to see it, but everyone including my beloved Aunt recommended it over and over. And over. And over. So, I caved. Six more viewings, including the last 2 on the same day, and I have had a record for me for one single movie unbroken since 1990. Yes, I saw Pretty Woman 7 times in the movie theatres. Obviously, I loved it back then. And still do. It's always like an old friend when I revisit this, albeit, one I can quote word for word, but still. Granted the movie's one singular flaw is that it's not the most original concept. For that, on my personal scientific scale of rating movies, it lost one single point bringing the overall score to 99/100. Rarely, on my list, will any movie even get above 95/100, let alone 99/100and only one got to 100/100. So, when I even state the word "flaw," I mean in the absolute smallest of ways. And besides, they address this with that one funny line: "What, you want me to name someone? You want like a name? Oh, God, the pressure of a name... I got it. Cindafuckin'rella!"  Kit Actually, come to think of it, there's dozens of funny lines, motions, scenes. I laugh as hard as I cry during each viewing. This movie is absolutely brilliant from beginning to end with its perfect balance of drama, comedy and romance. Emotionally beaten down Vivian (Julia Roberts  in a role that propelled her into space) had just recently begun streetwalking when she's picked up, initially for directions, by &uuml;ber-rich Edward Lewis (Richard Gere in a masterful performance) on Hollywood Boulevard. When it's realized she's a hooker with a heart and he's a hopeless romantic, they slowly begin a relationship, despite her being requested, um paid, to be at his "beck and call" for the remainder of his business trip in L.A. Of course, things are going to get complicated as roles are defined, and others have been thrown into the mix, but these two actors were so incredibly believable, so real and had so many genuine reactions and improved lines/scenes, you will fall hard for their romance. I've wanted to write this review of one of my all time favorite movies for quite some time. Sadly, I do not think, even with the countless (home) viewings, that I will do this movie justice. I will just say what's on my mind, and always on my mind when I see this: Fantastic lines, great pacing, deep romance, believable faces, one of the best soundtracks ever, also great score, real and fun. From beginning to end, I get involved and not just because I've seen it before; it's just a journey I love to get involved in and always pretend it's my first time. So much so, that I literally smile wide (like the absolutely stunning Roberts in this) when a scene comes up I didn't allow myself to recall. This has been, is and always will be one of my all-time favorite movies. It thoroughly improved on the old Cinderella story one-hundred times. And this version is absolutely timeless. Side Note: As mentioned above, I've seen this movie 7 times in the theatre and the last 2 of those, on the same day. Just to explain, I had the day off of school, and was to meet my friends at the now-defunct Valley West Mall's dollar theatre. Actually, it was Tuesday's 50 cent day. So, while waiting on my friends, who did not have the day off, I decided on seeing Pretty Woman for the sixth and final time during the early afternoon. Little did I know, they, too, wanted to see it, so I went to go with them to the same theatre screen, the same day, to see Pretty Woman a seventh time. Side Note II: Since I am a huge Superman fan, I wanted to break this 7x in the theatre record in 2006 with Superman Returns. Sadly, as much as I liked that movie (and wanted to more) I could only make it to 5 viewings. Here's to 2013's Man of Steel. I am going to try and break the record once more!

    Pretty Woman is a decent movie with a pretty simple,clich&eacute; story line,but there is a good cast.The movie is a chick flick,but they usually have some kind of conflict,Pretty Woman is just two hours of Richard Gere and Julia Roberts going to different places with each other and showing off how in love they are,although I did think both these actors gave their best to this simple,plain movie,and they definitely had good chemistry on set,and if it wasn't for their impressive acting,I would be giving this movie a much lower rating than 6. Edward Lewis (Richard Gere) falls in love with a prostitute (Julia Roberts) he meets at Beverly Hills and begins spoiling her with his wealth.

    watching this movie at night,pretty woman gives me some thinking and surprise.it is about personality.the compare between cold thinking and warm heart.a good movie. Roberts is sweet,the changing of her emotion in this film is the main topic.no matter happy or sorrow,it is all about falling in love.this film is better than dying young,the changing is more interesting,but the main actor is not handsome than the main actor in dying young though he is more reasonable.Roberts somehow always gives person kind of happy feeling,not sad.especially when she smiles.i will watch her other movies when i am free from doing my job.though she is getting old now .

    To maintain their wholesome image, Walt Disney Studios released "Pretty Woman" under the umbrella of their ancillary company, Touchstone Pictures. But "Pretty Woman", a feature film about a prostitute who turns into a princess after meeting a Californian prince, is no more sleazy than Disney's animated films aimed at children. The message, values and narrative arcs are all the same. The plot? Richard Gere plays a millionaire who's depressed because "his father doesn't love him". Disillusioned, he prepares to dismantle and downsize his giant corporate empire. Luckily he meets a hooker played by Julia Roberts. He showers her in money, riches and fine clothes, she teaches him to be a kind, good businessman who "provides jobs to shipbuilders". She rescues him from depression and "bad" capitalism, he rescues her from the slums, prostitution and, ergo, "bad" capitalism. The couple no longer screw people over, be it as prostitutes or as corporate raiders, but engage in "moral transactions". They get married, live happily ever after and he builds warships. Like "Indecent Proposal", released around the same time, the super-wealthy are initially malevolent but reveal themselves to be caring and decent. Prostitution is good, clean, profitable, fun and "just another career choice". Women, as prostitutes, make their own decisions and are entirely independent, strong and in control of their bodies and choices. Softcore titillation is used, and the prevailing aesthetic is one which bows down to wealth, riches, materialism and money. The end goal is always monogamous marital bliss, women gladly debase themselves to be with their wealthy providers and love conquers all difficulties and is constant. Furthermore, super-rich princes are the male ideal and hookers with hearts of gold are the female ideal. Prostitution has no serious consequences, prostitution is glorified and takes place between free women and sensitive guys, and monogamous marriage, capitalism, patriarchy, and commodification are all endorsed. Elsewhere expensive finery masks amorality, men mould women into their own little dolls, corruption is unimportant (because everyone is corrupt, everyone's a whore, and so corruption is relative), corporate raiders care about people other than themselves (members from the urban poor, no less) and disparages in wealth, taste, experience and education are both cute and don't thwart romance. Compare this to Francois Truffaut's "The Soft Skin", where the provincial mannerisms of a similar woman are mocked by her aristocratic lover. To make the film work, Big Business must be glorified as much as prostitution. Gere's a Prince Charming, climbing towers to rescue his lady. Oddly, the film is adored by women. It very much represents a post-feminist stance; as all female desire is celebrated, the fantasy of winning a rich prince is super cool, even if this first means that a woman must first unconsciously self-identify as a "whore". Servitute is embraced because the self is redefined as feminine-consumer, allowed to window-shop for any and all desires, which in this case is implicitly connected to women's magazines, the fashion industry and the disciplined use of makeup, clothing, exercise etc. Everyone can be transformed from working girl to lady of leisure, everyone is allowed to dream of being valuable and feel valued, everyone is trained in the art of seduction, self-marketing, sexual gratification and consumer display. 4/10 - "My Fair Lady" meets "Cinderella" meets "Pygmalion". Worth one viewing.

    I like Julia Roberts but this was such a step backward for women. Come on seriously how could anyone think of this as a romance?? There were so many clich&eacute;s in this movie I began to wonder if it was just one big commercial for male body spray like Axe. Where could a relationship like this go? They going to have children? Hey Mom how did you and Dad meet? Oh I was hooking down on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and your Dad gave me $100 to spend the night with him. Isn't that sooo romantic. Blech! Imagine every time they get into an argument and he tells her she is just hooker anyway and should be happy with what she's got. Although, this film was made in the 90's it must have been written in the 50's back when men had some crazy control issues and wished they could just keep women down...oh wait a minute how much has really changed since then? This film is less of a Cinderella story for hookers and more of a Cinderfella story for "Johns".

    "Pretty Woman" is a lightweight but entertaining fairy tale about Prince Charming. Everything about director Garry Marshall's upbeat romantic comedy is as contrived as it is sugar coated from subversion of any sort. Although it received an R rating, this sappy two hour plus love story shows what happens to a handsome but heartless Wall Street titan when he encounters a savvy street prostitute in Beverly Hills and how their lives change radically for the better. Despite its predictable plot, "Pretty Woman" wins us over with the chemistry and charisma of the principals. Richard Gere plays protagonist Edward Lewis with wisdom and suavity. He is a businessman who buys companies and then breaks them up and sells them off. Consequently, the milk of human kindness doesn't flow in his blood. Sheer coincidence brings our hero face to face with the heroine, young but gorgeous, and "Pretty Woman" charts their fate together. Reportedly, scenarist J.T. Lawton's original script emphasized gutter realism over utter unreality. Marshall and his writers have sanded off all the rough edges. Our hero is in Los Angles when he discovers that his girlfriend is about to ditch him. He tries to drive a Lotus Esprit and nearly wrecks it. Kit and Vivian are prowling their share of the sidewalk when Edward cruises up and parks. Of course, he hasn't so much parked as jammed his car up so he cannot get it to run. He inquires for directions for Beverley Hills from her. He asks her afterward if she can drive the Lotus. They wind up at his Beverley Hills hotel and Edward buys Vivian for the night and then the week. He shells out thousands of dollars to get Vivian a proper wardrobe so she can accompany him in public and appear presentable. Chiefly, Edward wants to buy out a company that makes ships and sell it off, but the owner-founder, James Morse (Ralph Bellamy of "The Professionals") refuses to bow out without a fight. Edward did not have a good relationship with his own father Carson. Indeed, when Carter died, neither had spoken to each other in 14 and a half years. Initially, Edward savors the process of carving up Morse's company until he begins to see him as a human. Richard Gere and Julia Roberts make Edward and Vivian very palatable, very sexy, and very sympathetic. The happily ever after ending is contrived. Interestingly, the two principals move onto to better things. Ostensibly, Jason Alexander is delivers the best performance as Edward's cutthroat attorney, Philip Stuckey, who has been with him ten years. Philip's abrasive treatment of Vivian alienates Edward and he fires Philip. Hector Elizondo has a memorable supporting role as the hotel manager who helps Vivian with her wardrobe. There isn't a single character in this romantic comedy that has any depth or subtlety. Marshall relies on wardrobe to define his characters and neither the protagonist nor the heroine is ever in jeopardy. The Beverly Hills shopping scene when our heroine returns to Rodeo Driver is amusing. The people who made this diverting epic create characters that you find yourself rooting for and liking and the villains get their comeuppance.

    Calling this movie a romance is pretty much a disgrace. Let's not forget something. The heroine is a hooker! The hooker with the heart of gold! Please! I don't buy at all that Richard Gere, as a millionaire or even a $40,000 a year salesman, would fall in love with the hooker, Julia Roberts. First of all, Julia Roberts isn't all that hot. It's hard to even call her "pretty", the first word in the tittle of the movie. She's not ugly, but she's just a little above average, bordering on pretty. That aside, stud millionaires do not fall in love with hookers. They might pay one from time to time, but they don't fall in love them. The whole premise of this movie is idiotic, so the movie is unsuccessful to me as a whole. All that aside, Gere was very good in the film, and Roberts acting was also very good. The movie had outstanding production value and certain characters, like the one played by Jason Alexander, were interesting. So, as a total score, I give Pretty Woman a five.

    This is from Roy Orbinson 1964's hit song that reached its cinematic posterity 26 years later, with Garry Marshall's film of the same name. Oddly enough, when taken in the context of the film, the lyrics take a totally different significance since the titular 'pretty woman' doesn't quite walk on the streets for pleasure. Of course, the song is used for the film's trademark sequence when Vivian tries new clothes from prestigious French sounding shops, fulfilling every little girl's fantasy. But there's something genuinely appealing in Julia Robert's performance, a sort of child-like eagerness to embrace a one-week dream and do whatever she wants because she got woman's most cherished accessory, not a handbag, not a lipstick or a mirror, but a credit card. Don't take that statement as patronizing and misogynistic please, "Sex and the City" convey the same message, and bluntly assumes it. What differentiates Vivian from the other feminist icons though relies on the roots of her constant enthusiasm, forever incarnated by Robert's unique smile  and irresistible giggles. Indeed, no matter how much fun she has while seizing her luxurious days, we know that she's happy, more than anything, because she's in love. And the man might be rich, handsome and powerful, like a modernization of the 'Charming Prince' figure, there's something that oddly rings true in that peculiar love story. And this is a credit to two fine performances from Julia Roberts and Richard Gere, and a clever screenplay that doesn't take its premise for granted, starting from the obligatory meeting, which is the hit-or-miss of romantic comedies. Gere is Edward Lewis, he can't drive a friend's car and find his way to the hotel, he meets a prostitute named Vivian, she's not only attractive, but she's smart. She knows about car and end up driving him to the hotel. So, when he invites for just one night, that will turns into one week, plot-wise, the machine is working. "I want the fairy tale" she admits later, with an innocence that sweeps off all the dirt that has tarnished her life since she started walking on the streets. Never in the film, had she felt more sincere and more naively appealing. All little girls want the fairy tale, and that quote, if one thing, highlights the fact there still is that 'little girl' sparkle in Vivian's eyes, and her profession is only a logical consequence to unfortunate circumstances. But the film doesn't fall in the patronizing trap either, Vivian needs Edwards, but so does he. There's a clever parallel established by these two people's jobs, Edward buys out companies facing economic difficulties, to sell parts of them and make more profits. As she says, both screw people for money, and Edward is no more honorable than Vivian. Both hearts reflect the other's truth, that's the mark of true love and that's exactly what happens to Edward and Vivian. There's a nice subplot involving one company Edward doesn't want to buy because he likes its chairman, who's a sort of fatherly figure, wonderfully played by Ralph Bellamy, and it's only after his experience with Vivian that he realizes he doesn't enjoy his job as she did and might have chosen the wrong path for some obscure Oedipal reasons. Vivian, didn't embrace her career with more passion either, but maybe she kept on hoping of a real love, one that would be incarnated by the only thing she couldn't give her customers: a kiss. And the pay-off comes when she tenderly kisses a sleeping Edward in the mouth, at that point, we know she loves him. "Pretty Woman" doesn't overplay the whole Pygmalion-theme, that one is handled by Hector Elizondo, the hotel manager who, from despising Vivian, grows fond on her and teaches her how to properly behave. But the film doesn't use their archetypes for the sake of cheap laughs, it doesn't need to, Roberts is hilarious because she stays natural in a world she doesn't belong to, and never condescending either, Edward is inspired by her spontaneity, something that cruelly lacks in his work of sophistication and cynical materialism, incarnated by his friend and lawyer, played by Joe Constanza. Constanza, as the only true antagonist of the film, is responsible of one of the film's saddest parts, after Gere comforted him that Vivian wasn't a spy. After being approached like a cheap prostitute, you could feel she was truly hurt by Edward's betrayal. And this is what the film is about, two persons who don't want to be reduced to condescending label, one in the highest, and another in the lowest extreme. Being treated like a prostitute is the ultimate insult for Vivian because it totally negates her struggle to let her personality finally bloom, as Edward knows he's not that rich prick who only thinks in green bills. It's all about becoming yourself. I don't intend to make the film sound like an existential journey; it's still a heart-warming comedy but more intelligent and subtle than any comedy made today. And I'm sure in retrospect; many critics who despised the films would feel guilty for having labeled "Pretty Woman" too straightforwardly as a banal and commercial romantic comedy. Rom-com, chick-flick, Cinderella story, feel-good story  cinematic jargon is rich of epithets to describe Garry Marshall's "Pretty Woman". Yet these words are too convenient and tend to veil the true poignancy and endearing chemistry between the two leads. Yes, we have the rich workaholic businessman with a disastrous sentimental life, meeting the streetwise hooker, with a heart of gold, but when played by Richard Gere and Julia Roberts whose shining smile illuminates the screen like a lamppost in Hollywood Boulevard, the film turns out to far better than some cynical minds might expect. At the end, I was left wondering: aren't the so-called stereotypes the names we give to obligatory plot devices when they're wrongly handled?

    I must admit that I find this movie one of the most offensive ever to come out of Hollywood. I can suspend disbelief, but this is ridiculous. Perhaps it is because I know too much about how this movie started, have lived in Hollywood myself and seen many documentaries on the real lives of prostitutes. The original script was intended as a very dark, cautionary tale about class warfare and prostitution in the Los Angeles area. It was then completely revamped as a high budget romantic comedy. As a result, it became one of the most successful box office movies of all time. First, while there are probably many handsome johns - they rarely are as good looking as Edward (Richard Gere). Nor are they as respectful. Well, maybe on one of those sugar baby websites. But that's different than picking up some random dude on the street like Vivian (Julia Roberts) did. After their first sexual encounter, Edward hires Vivian for the week to "escort" him to social events. So she's giving it up for a whole week for 3K? Maybe that was the going rate in 1990. He also gives her access to his credit cards. I suppose that could make up for it -- and maybe there are some guys who have done that before. Seems like a stupid move to trust a woman who takes sex for money. She could run those things up in no time, especially in a ridiculously expensive town like L.A. Vivian gets snubbed on Rodeo Drive. Well, that's believable, because anyone without their nose in the air gets snubbed there - street whore or not. But being snubbed at the hotel makes no sense. Many of those hotels make their living with high end prostitutes. Or at least bimbos who look like they are. Go to any fancy hotel and you will see decked out babes. Doesn't mean they're all whores -- but many of them look like they could be. I once found out in Vegas that many women who dressed up there were hookers. And I had a classy dress that revealed nothing - in fact, it wasn't even tight. So we are supposed to believe that Vivian isn't capable of buying a dress or using utensils at the dinner table? Sorry, she is not street enough to believe that. She looks like some chick who ran away from Nebraska - not a down and dirty Hollywood whore. Or course, Heidi Fleiss had a stable of classy looking chicks. But that's the point - a woman who looks like Roberts is usually part of a service, not someone hanging out on the street. I've heard that many johns like to tell their secrets and bare their souls to whores. So when Mr. Nice Guy reveals that he was estranged from his now dead father that could make sense. Because poor little Vivian was snubbed at the store, Edward comes to the rescue and takes her shopping. I think the most dangerous thing about this film is that even though it is rated R, plenty of young girls have seen it. Glamorizing prostitution in any way is irresponsible. Some prostitutes may have married one of her johns. But that's something that happens less than the chance of winning the lotto. Prostitution will always exist, but let's not make it out to be something it isn't. Sure, there are probably some happy hookers out there - but I've not met or heard of a single one. The truth is that most of the people I've seen or known of who have sex for money came from abuse, are on drugs or have very low self esteem. This whole movie is so phony and full of lies -- not even the ad is real. They used a body double because little miss goodie two shoes herself -- Julia Roberts - while willing to play a street hooker - not only refused to do nude scenes, but the movie poster legs aren't hers, either. Or maybe she didn't look as good in the photo. I rest my case -- this movie is just a disgrace. I will agree that it deserved to be nominated for an Oscar and win some awards -- because so many movies are contrived, complete and utter nonsense.

    Rom-coms are, generally speaking, not a great genre favourite of mine. It may be a tricky balance by having to have both comedy and romantic elements but there are a dozen examples I could name that fail on either one or both counts - "The Accidental Husband", "27 Dresses", "Fifty First Dates", "Never Been Kissed", "Bridget Jones: The Edge Of Reason" and so on. Being married, it is almost inevitable that I will watch a romantic comedy at some point but occasionally, she picks an absolute corker and I'm delighted to add this movie onto the 'good' pile. It might not be a realistic picture in any meaningful sense but as a pantomime, this is as good as it gets. Richard Gere plays corporate shark Edward Lewis, hugely rich and successful and visiting LA to seal his latest acquisition. His personal life, however, is a mess and after borrowing his lawyer-friend Philip Stuckey's (Jason Alexander) Lotus and getting lost in Beverly Hills, he meets hooker Vivian (Julia Roberts) and asks her for directions. Thus begins an unusual arrangement where Vivian agrees to spend the week as Edward's escort for $3000. While Edward struggles with his increasing attraction to Vivian, she struggles for acceptance amid the high-society she now finds herself in. Despite being a pumpkin short of being a straight-up adaptation of "Cinderella", "Pretty Woman" is an unashamed romantic flight of fancy fuelled by conversations about nothing in particular and long stares full of meaning. As a fable, it is a winner but as a serious character study, the film is found wanting. Roberts never convinces as a prostitute at any point in the film, looking far too clean-cut and well-fed although she has plenty of sass and her biting back at the snobs around her is quite amusing as are her scenes with Hector Elizondo's hotel manager. Gere, for his part, has little to do but seem distant but available which is exactly what he is. But we never seem to find out why he is the way he is other than being focused on his career. Instead, we get snippets of personality such as the scene at the piano but nothing to explain why he likes playing it to complete strangers. It's maddeningly short when it comes to the details but then you remind yourself (and indeed, the movie itself does) that this is "Cinderella" and like all fairy tales, they don't bear up to well to things like plot scrutiny. I never heard anyone voice the suggestion that Cinderella is the only person in the land with that particular shoe size... So this is one of those rare films where I can forgive the faults and just enjoy the damn thing. It isn't perfect - Roberts just isn't the right actress for the part and Gere needs a serious charisma transplant - but because it's a winning story, you can sit back and go with the flow. Whether its the romance with real chemistry from the leads or the battle-of-the-classes subplot, you buy into it in a way that most rom-coms can only dream of. Certainly my Better Half had that look on her face that said "Go on, girl!" during certain scenes, although she prefers "Dirty Dancing". I can see where she's coming from - that too has problems at its heart but the soundtrack just about rescues that film for me personally. This is much more enjoyable but whatever you do, don't take it seriously and don't question the plot too much.

    "Fifty bucks, Grandpa. For seventy-five, the wife can watch." - Kit I could write this review in the dark. I've seen Pretty Woman so many times, I cannot count. I take that back: I can count how many timesI saw it in the theatre. Back in Summer 1990  yes, months after this opened, I saw it for the first time, in an empty theatre, during an afternoon weekday. I didn't want to see it, but everyone including my beloved Aunt recommended it over and over. And over. And over. So, I caved. Six more viewings, including the last 2 on the same day, and I have had a record for me for one single movie unbroken since 1990. Yes, I saw Pretty Woman 7 times in the movie theatres. Obviously, I loved it back then. And still do. It's always like an old friend when I revisit this, albeit, one I can quote word for word, but still. Granted the movie's one singular flaw is that it's not the most original concept. For that, on my personal scientific scale of rating movies, it lost one single point bringing the overall score to 99/100. Rarely, on my list, will any movie even get above 95/100, let alone 99/100and only one got to 100/100. So, when I even state the word "flaw," I mean in the absolute smallest of ways. And besides, they address this with that one funny line: "What, you want me to name someone? You want like a name? Oh, God, the pressure of a name... I got it. Cindafuckin'rella!"  Kit Actually, come to think of it, there's dozens of funny lines, motions, scenes. I laugh as hard as I cry during each viewing. This movie is absolutely brilliant from beginning to end with its perfect balance of drama, comedy and romance. Emotionally beaten down Vivian (Julia Roberts  in a role that propelled her into space) had just recently begun streetwalking when she's picked up, initially for directions, by &uuml;ber-rich Edward Lewis (Richard Gere in a masterful performance) on Hollywood Boulevard. When it's realized she's a hooker with a heart and he's a hopeless romantic, they slowly begin a relationship, despite her being requested, um paid, to be at his "beck and call" for the remainder of his business trip in L.A. Of course, things are going to get complicated as roles are defined, and others have been thrown into the mix, but these two actors were so incredibly believable, so real and had so many genuine reactions and improved lines/scenes, you will fall hard for their romance. I've wanted to write this review of one of my all time favorite movies for quite some time. Sadly, I do not think, even with the countless (home) viewings, that I will do this movie justice. I will just say what's on my mind, and always on my mind when I see this: Fantastic lines, great pacing, deep romance, believable faces, one of the best soundtracks ever, also great score, real and fun. From beginning to end, I get involved and not just because I've seen it before; it's just a journey I love to get involved in and always pretend it's my first time. So much so, that I literally smile wide (like the absolutely stunning Roberts in this) when a scene comes up I didn't allow myself to recall. This has been, is and always will be one of my all-time favorite movies. It thoroughly improved on the old Cinderella story one-hundred times. And this version is absolutely timeless. Side Note: As mentioned above, I've seen this movie 7 times in the theatre and the last 2 of those, on the same day. Just to explain, I had the day off of school, and was to meet my friends at the now-defunct Valley West Mall's dollar theatre. Actually, it was Tuesday's 50 cent day. So, while waiting on my friends, who did not have the day off, I decided on seeing Pretty Woman for the sixth and final time during the early afternoon. Little did I know, they, too, wanted to see it, so I went to go with them to the same theatre screen, the same day, to see Pretty Woman a seventh time. Side Note II: Since I am a huge Superman fan, I wanted to break this 7x in the theatre record in 2006 with Superman Returns. Sadly, as much as I liked that movie (and wanted to more) I could only make it to 5 viewings. Here's to 2013's Man of Steel. I am going to try and break the record once more!

    Pretty Woman is a decent movie with a pretty simple,clich&eacute; story line,but there is a good cast.The movie is a chick flick,but they usually have some kind of conflict,Pretty Woman is just two hours of Richard Gere and Julia Roberts going to different places with each other and showing off how in love they are,although I did think both these actors gave their best to this simple,plain movie,and they definitely had good chemistry on set,and if it wasn't for their impressive acting,I would be giving this movie a much lower rating than 6. Edward Lewis (Richard Gere) falls in love with a prostitute (Julia Roberts) he meets at Beverly Hills and begins spoiling her with his wealth.

    watching this movie at night,pretty woman gives me some thinking and surprise.it is about personality.the compare between cold thinking and warm heart.a good movie. Roberts is sweet,the changing of her emotion in this film is the main topic.no matter happy or sorrow,it is all about falling in love.this film is better than dying young,the changing is more interesting,but the main actor is not handsome than the main actor in dying young though he is more reasonable.Roberts somehow always gives person kind of happy feeling,not sad.especially when she smiles.i will watch her other movies when i am free from doing my job.though she is getting old now .

    To maintain their wholesome image, Walt Disney Studios released "Pretty Woman" under the umbrella of their ancillary company, Touchstone Pictures. But "Pretty Woman", a feature film about a prostitute who turns into a princess after meeting a Californian prince, is no more sleazy than Disney's animated films aimed at children. The message, values and narrative arcs are all the same. The plot? Richard Gere plays a millionaire who's depressed because "his father doesn't love him". Disillusioned, he prepares to dismantle and downsize his giant corporate empire. Luckily he meets a hooker played by Julia Roberts. He showers her in money, riches and fine clothes, she teaches him to be a kind, good businessman who "provides jobs to shipbuilders". She rescues him from depression and "bad" capitalism, he rescues her from the slums, prostitution and, ergo, "bad" capitalism. The couple no longer screw people over, be it as prostitutes or as corporate raiders, but engage in "moral transactions". They get married, live happily ever after and he builds warships. Like "Indecent Proposal", released around the same time, the super-wealthy are initially malevolent but reveal themselves to be caring and decent. Prostitution is good, clean, profitable, fun and "just another career choice". Women, as prostitutes, make their own decisions and are entirely independent, strong and in control of their bodies and choices. Softcore titillation is used, and the prevailing aesthetic is one which bows down to wealth, riches, materialism and money. The end goal is always monogamous marital bliss, women gladly debase themselves to be with their wealthy providers and love conquers all difficulties and is constant. Furthermore, super-rich princes are the male ideal and hookers with hearts of gold are the female ideal. Prostitution has no serious consequences, prostitution is glorified and takes place between free women and sensitive guys, and monogamous marriage, capitalism, patriarchy, and commodification are all endorsed. Elsewhere expensive finery masks amorality, men mould women into their own little dolls, corruption is unimportant (because everyone is corrupt, everyone's a whore, and so corruption is relative), corporate raiders care about people other than themselves (members from the urban poor, no less) and disparages in wealth, taste, experience and education are both cute and don't thwart romance. Compare this to Francois Truffaut's "The Soft Skin", where the provincial mannerisms of a similar woman are mocked by her aristocratic lover. To make the film work, Big Business must be glorified as much as prostitution. Gere's a Prince Charming, climbing towers to rescue his lady. Oddly, the film is adored by women. It very much represents a post-feminist stance; as all female desire is celebrated, the fantasy of winning a rich prince is super cool, even if this first means that a woman must first unconsciously self-identify as a "whore". Servitute is embraced because the self is redefined as feminine-consumer, allowed to window-shop for any and all desires, which in this case is implicitly connected to women's magazines, the fashion industry and the disciplined use of makeup, clothing, exercise etc. Everyone can be transformed from working girl to lady of leisure, everyone is allowed to dream of being valuable and feel valued, everyone is trained in the art of seduction, self-marketing, sexual gratification and consumer display. 4/10 - "My Fair Lady" meets "Cinderella" meets "Pygmalion". Worth one viewing.

    I like Julia Roberts but this was such a step backward for women. Come on seriously how could anyone think of this as a romance?? There were so many clich&eacute;s in this movie I began to wonder if it was just one big commercial for male body spray like Axe. Where could a relationship like this go? They going to have children? Hey Mom how did you and Dad meet? Oh I was hooking down on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and your Dad gave me $100 to spend the night with him. Isn't that sooo romantic. Blech! Imagine every time they get into an argument and he tells her she is just hooker anyway and should be happy with what she's got. Although, this film was made in the 90's it must have been written in the 50's back when men had some crazy control issues and wished they could just keep women down...oh wait a minute how much has really changed since then? This film is less of a Cinderella story for hookers and more of a Cinderfella story for "Johns".

    "Pretty Woman" is a lightweight but entertaining fairy tale about Prince Charming. Everything about director Garry Marshall's upbeat romantic comedy is as contrived as it is sugar coated from subversion of any sort. Although it received an R rating, this sappy two hour plus love story shows what happens to a handsome but heartless Wall Street titan when he encounters a savvy street prostitute in Beverly Hills and how their lives change radically for the better. Despite its predictable plot, "Pretty Woman" wins us over with the chemistry and charisma of the principals. Richard Gere plays protagonist Edward Lewis with wisdom and suavity. He is a businessman who buys companies and then breaks them up and sells them off. Consequently, the milk of human kindness doesn't flow in his blood. Sheer coincidence brings our hero face to face with the heroine, young but gorgeous, and "Pretty Woman" charts their fate together. Reportedly, scenarist J.T. Lawton's original script emphasized gutter realism over utter unreality. Marshall and his writers have sanded off all the rough edges. Our hero is in Los Angles when he discovers that his girlfriend is about to ditch him. He tries to drive a Lotus Esprit and nearly wrecks it. Kit and Vivian are prowling their share of the sidewalk when Edward cruises up and parks. Of course, he hasn't so much parked as jammed his car up so he cannot get it to run. He inquires for directions for Beverley Hills from her. He asks her afterward if she can drive the Lotus. They wind up at his Beverley Hills hotel and Edward buys Vivian for the night and then the week. He shells out thousands of dollars to get Vivian a proper wardrobe so she can accompany him in public and appear presentable. Chiefly, Edward wants to buy out a company that makes ships and sell it off, but the owner-founder, James Morse (Ralph Bellamy of "The Professionals") refuses to bow out without a fight. Edward did not have a good relationship with his own father Carson. Indeed, when Carter died, neither had spoken to each other in 14 and a half years. Initially, Edward savors the process of carving up Morse's company until he begins to see him as a human. Richard Gere and Julia Roberts make Edward and Vivian very palatable, very sexy, and very sympathetic. The happily ever after ending is contrived. Interestingly, the two principals move onto to better things. Ostensibly, Jason Alexander is delivers the best performance as Edward's cutthroat attorney, Philip Stuckey, who has been with him ten years. Philip's abrasive treatment of Vivian alienates Edward and he fires Philip. Hector Elizondo has a memorable supporting role as the hotel manager who helps Vivian with her wardrobe. There isn't a single character in this romantic comedy that has any depth or subtlety. Marshall relies on wardrobe to define his characters and neither the protagonist nor the heroine is ever in jeopardy. The Beverly Hills shopping scene when our heroine returns to Rodeo Driver is amusing. The people who made this diverting epic create characters that you find yourself rooting for and liking and the villains get their comeuppance.

    Calling this movie a romance is pretty much a disgrace. Let's not forget something. The heroine is a hooker! The hooker with the heart of gold! Please! I don't buy at all that Richard Gere, as a millionaire or even a $40,000 a year salesman, would fall in love with the hooker, Julia Roberts. First of all, Julia Roberts isn't all that hot. It's hard to even call her "pretty", the first word in the tittle of the movie. She's not ugly, but she's just a little above average, bordering on pretty. That aside, stud millionaires do not fall in love with hookers. They might pay one from time to time, but they don't fall in love them. The whole premise of this movie is idiotic, so the movie is unsuccessful to me as a whole. All that aside, Gere was very good in the film, and Roberts acting was also very good. The movie had outstanding production value and certain characters, like the one played by Jason Alexander, were interesting. So, as a total score, I give Pretty Woman a five.

    This is from Roy Orbinson 1964's hit song that reached its cinematic posterity 26 years later, with Garry Marshall's film of the same name. Oddly enough, when taken in the context of the film, the lyrics take a totally different significance since the titular 'pretty woman' doesn't quite walk on the streets for pleasure. Of course, the song is used for the film's trademark sequence when Vivian tries new clothes from prestigious French sounding shops, fulfilling every little girl's fantasy. But there's something genuinely appealing in Julia Robert's performance, a sort of child-like eagerness to embrace a one-week dream and do whatever she wants because she got woman's most cherished accessory, not a handbag, not a lipstick or a mirror, but a credit card. Don't take that statement as patronizing and misogynistic please, "Sex and the City" convey the same message, and bluntly assumes it. What differentiates Vivian from the other feminist icons though relies on the roots of her constant enthusiasm, forever incarnated by Robert's unique smile  and irresistible giggles. Indeed, no matter how much fun she has while seizing her luxurious days, we know that she's happy, more than anything, because she's in love. And the man might be rich, handsome and powerful, like a modernization of the 'Charming Prince' figure, there's something that oddly rings true in that peculiar love story. And this is a credit to two fine performances from Julia Roberts and Richard Gere, and a clever screenplay that doesn't take its premise for granted, starting from the obligatory meeting, which is the hit-or-miss of romantic comedies. Gere is Edward Lewis, he can't drive a friend's car and find his way to the hotel, he meets a prostitute named Vivian, she's not only attractive, but she's smart. She knows about car and end up driving him to the hotel. So, when he invites for just one night, that will turns into one week, plot-wise, the machine is working. "I want the fairy tale" she admits later, with an innocence that sweeps off all the dirt that has tarnished her life since she started walking on the streets. Never in the film, had she felt more sincere and more naively appealing. All little girls want the fairy tale, and that quote, if one thing, highlights the fact there still is that 'little girl' sparkle in Vivian's eyes, and her profession is only a logical consequence to unfortunate circumstances. But the film doesn't fall in the patronizing trap either, Vivian needs Edwards, but so does he. There's a clever parallel established by these two people's jobs, Edward buys out companies facing economic difficulties, to sell parts of them and make more profits. As she says, both screw people for money, and Edward is no more honorable than Vivian. Both hearts reflect the other's truth, that's the mark of true love and that's exactly what happens to Edward and Vivian. There's a nice subplot involving one company Edward doesn't want to buy because he likes its chairman, who's a sort of fatherly figure, wonderfully played by Ralph Bellamy, and it's only after his experience with Vivian that he realizes he doesn't enjoy his job as she did and might have chosen the wrong path for some obscure Oedipal reasons. Vivian, didn't embrace her career with more passion either, but maybe she kept on hoping of a real love, one that would be incarnated by the only thing she couldn't give her customers: a kiss. And the pay-off comes when she tenderly kisses a sleeping Edward in the mouth, at that point, we know she loves him. "Pretty Woman" doesn't overplay the whole Pygmalion-theme, that one is handled by Hector Elizondo, the hotel manager who, from despising Vivian, grows fond on her and teaches her how to properly behave. But the film doesn't use their archetypes for the sake of cheap laughs, it doesn't need to, Roberts is hilarious because she stays natural in a world she doesn't belong to, and never condescending either, Edward is inspired by her spontaneity, something that cruelly lacks in his work of sophistication and cynical materialism, incarnated by his friend and lawyer, played by Joe Constanza. Constanza, as the only true antagonist of the film, is responsible of one of the film's saddest parts, after Gere comforted him that Vivian wasn't a spy. After being approached like a cheap prostitute, you could feel she was truly hurt by Edward's betrayal. And this is what the film is about, two persons who don't want to be reduced to condescending label, one in the highest, and another in the lowest extreme. Being treated like a prostitute is the ultimate insult for Vivian because it totally negates her struggle to let her personality finally bloom, as Edward knows he's not that rich prick who only thinks in green bills. It's all about becoming yourself. I don't intend to make the film sound like an existential journey; it's still a heart-warming comedy but more intelligent and subtle than any comedy made today. And I'm sure in retrospect; many critics who despised the films would feel guilty for having labeled "Pretty Woman" too straightforwardly as a banal and commercial romantic comedy. Rom-com, chick-flick, Cinderella story, feel-good story  cinematic jargon is rich of epithets to describe Garry Marshall's "Pretty Woman". Yet these words are too convenient and tend to veil the true poignancy and endearing chemistry between the two leads. Yes, we have the rich workaholic businessman with a disastrous sentimental life, meeting the streetwise hooker, with a heart of gold, but when played by Richard Gere and Julia Roberts whose shining smile illuminates the screen like a lamppost in Hollywood Boulevard, the film turns out to far better than some cynical minds might expect. At the end, I was left wondering: aren't the so-called stereotypes the names we give to obligatory plot devices when they're wrongly handled?

    I must admit that I find this movie one of the most offensive ever to come out of Hollywood. I can suspend disbelief, but this is ridiculous. Perhaps it is because I know too much about how this movie started, have lived in Hollywood myself and seen many documentaries on the real lives of prostitutes. The original script was intended as a very dark, cautionary tale about class warfare and prostitution in the Los Angeles area. It was then completely revamped as a high budget romantic comedy. As a result, it became one of the most successful box office movies of all time. First, while there are probably many handsome johns - they rarely are as good looking as Edward (Richard Gere). Nor are they as respectful. Well, maybe on one of those sugar baby websites. But that's different than picking up some random dude on the street like Vivian (Julia Roberts) did. After their first sexual encounter, Edward hires Vivian for the week to "escort" him to social events. So she's giving it up for a whole week for 3K? Maybe that was the going rate in 1990. He also gives her access to his credit cards. I suppose that could make up for it -- and maybe there are some guys who have done that before. Seems like a stupid move to trust a woman who takes sex for money. She could run those things up in no time, especially in a ridiculously expensive town like L.A. Vivian gets snubbed on Rodeo Drive. Well, that's believable, because anyone without their nose in the air gets snubbed there - street whore or not. But being snubbed at the hotel makes no sense. Many of those hotels make their living with high end prostitutes. Or at least bimbos who look like they are. Go to any fancy hotel and you will see decked out babes. Doesn't mean they're all whores -- but many of them look like they could be. I once found out in Vegas that many women who dressed up there were hookers. And I had a classy dress that revealed nothing - in fact, it wasn't even tight. So we are supposed to believe that Vivian isn't capable of buying a dress or using utensils at the dinner table? Sorry, she is not street enough to believe that. She looks like some chick who ran away from Nebraska - not a down and dirty Hollywood whore. Or course, Heidi Fleiss had a stable of classy looking chicks. But that's the point - a woman who looks like Roberts is usually part of a service, not someone hanging out on the street. I've heard that many johns like to tell their secrets and bare their souls to whores. So when Mr. Nice Guy reveals that he was estranged from his now dead father that could make sense. Because poor little Vivian was snubbed at the store, Edward comes to the rescue and takes her shopping. I think the most dangerous thing about this film is that even though it is rated R, plenty of young girls have seen it. Glamorizing prostitution in any way is irresponsible. Some prostitutes may have married one of her johns. But that's something that happens less than the chance of winning the lotto. Prostitution will always exist, but let's not make it out to be something it isn't. Sure, there are probably some happy hookers out there - but I've not met or heard of a single one. The truth is that most of the people I've seen or known of who have sex for money came from abuse, are on drugs or have very low self esteem. This whole movie is so phony and full of lies -- not even the ad is real. They used a body double because little miss goodie two shoes herself -- Julia Roberts - while willing to play a street hooker - not only refused to do nude scenes, but the movie poster legs aren't hers, either. Or maybe she didn't look as good in the photo. I rest my case -- this movie is just a disgrace. I will agree that it deserved to be nominated for an Oscar and win some awards -- because so many movies are contrived, complete and utter nonsense.

    Rom-coms are, generally speaking, not a great genre favourite of mine. It may be a tricky balance by having to have both comedy and romantic elements but there are a dozen examples I could name that fail on either one or both counts - "The Accidental Husband", "27 Dresses", "Fifty First Dates", "Never Been Kissed", "Bridget Jones: The Edge Of Reason" and so on. Being married, it is almost inevitable that I will watch a romantic comedy at some point but occasionally, she picks an absolute corker and I'm delighted to add this movie onto the 'good' pile. It might not be a realistic picture in any meaningful sense but as a pantomime, this is as good as it gets. Richard Gere plays corporate shark Edward Lewis, hugely rich and successful and visiting LA to seal his latest acquisition. His personal life, however, is a mess and after borrowing his lawyer-friend Philip Stuckey's (Jason Alexander) Lotus and getting lost in Beverly Hills, he meets hooker Vivian (Julia Roberts) and asks her for directions. Thus begins an unusual arrangement where Vivian agrees to spend the week as Edward's escort for $3000. While Edward struggles with his increasing attraction to Vivian, she struggles for acceptance amid the high-society she now finds herself in. Despite being a pumpkin short of being a straight-up adaptation of "Cinderella", "Pretty Woman" is an unashamed romantic flight of fancy fuelled by conversations about nothing in particular and long stares full of meaning. As a fable, it is a winner but as a serious character study, the film is found wanting. Roberts never convinces as a prostitute at any point in the film, looking far too clean-cut and well-fed although she has plenty of sass and her biting back at the snobs around her is quite amusing as are her scenes with Hector Elizondo's hotel manager. Gere, for his part, has little to do but seem distant but available which is exactly what he is. But we never seem to find out why he is the way he is other than being focused on his career. Instead, we get snippets of personality such as the scene at the piano but nothing to explain why he likes playing it to complete strangers. It's maddeningly short when it comes to the details but then you remind yourself (and indeed, the movie itself does) that this is "Cinderella" and like all fairy tales, they don't bear up to well to things like plot scrutiny. I never heard anyone voice the suggestion that Cinderella is the only person in the land with that particular shoe size... So this is one of those rare films where I can forgive the faults and just enjoy the damn thing. It isn't perfect - Roberts just isn't the right actress for the part and Gere needs a serious charisma transplant - but because it's a winning story, you can sit back and go with the flow. Whether its the romance with real chemistry from the leads or the battle-of-the-classes subplot, you buy into it in a way that most rom-coms can only dream of. Certainly my Better Half had that look on her face that said "Go on, girl!" during certain scenes, although she prefers "Dirty Dancing". I can see where she's coming from - that too has problems at its heart but the soundtrack just about rescues that film for me personally. This is much more enjoyable but whatever you do, don't take it seriously and don't question the plot too much.

    "Fifty bucks, Grandpa. For seventy-five, the wife can watch." - Kit I could write this review in the dark. I've seen Pretty Woman so many times, I cannot count. I take that back: I can count how many timesI saw it in the theatre. Back in Summer 1990  yes, months after this opened, I saw it for the first time, in an empty theatre, during an afternoon weekday. I didn't want to see it, but everyone including my beloved Aunt recommended it over and over. And over. And over. So, I caved. Six more viewings, including the last 2 on the same day, and I have had a record for me for one single movie unbroken since 1990. Yes, I saw Pretty Woman 7 times in the movie theatres. Obviously, I loved it back then. And still do. It's always like an old friend when I revisit this, albeit, one I can quote word for word, but still. Granted the movie's one singular flaw is that it's not the most original concept. For that, on my personal scientific scale of rating movies, it lost one single point bringing the overall score to 99/100. Rarely, on my list, will any movie even get above 95/100, let alone 99/100and only one got to 100/100. So, when I even state the word "flaw," I mean in the absolute smallest of ways. And besides, they address this with that one funny line: "What, you want me to name someone? You want like a name? Oh, God, the pressure of a name... I got it. Cindafuckin'rella!"  Kit Actually, come to think of it, there's dozens of funny lines, motions, scenes. I laugh as hard as I cry during each viewing. This movie is absolutely brilliant from beginning to end with its perfect balance of drama, comedy and romance. Emotionally beaten down Vivian (Julia Roberts  in a role that propelled her into space) had just recently begun streetwalking when she's picked up, initially for directions, by &uuml;ber-rich Edward Lewis (Richard Gere in a masterful performance) on Hollywood Boulevard. When it's realized she's a hooker with a heart and he's a hopeless romantic, they slowly begin a relationship, despite her being requested, um paid, to be at his "beck and call" for the remainder of his business trip in L.A. Of course, things are going to get complicated as roles are defined, and others have been thrown into the mix, but these two actors were so incredibly believable, so real and had so many genuine reactions and improved lines/scenes, you will fall hard for their romance. I've wanted to write this review of one of my all time favorite movies for quite some time. Sadly, I do not think, even with the countless (home) viewings, that I will do this movie justice. I will just say what's on my mind, and always on my mind when I see this: Fantastic lines, great pacing, deep romance, believable faces, one of the best soundtracks ever, also great score, real and fun. From beginning to end, I get involved and not just because I've seen it before; it's just a journey I love to get involved in and always pretend it's my first time. So much so, that I literally smile wide (like the absolutely stunning Roberts in this) when a scene comes up I didn't allow myself to recall. This has been, is and always will be one of my all-time favorite movies. It thoroughly improved on the old Cinderella story one-hundred times. And this version is absolutely timeless. Side Note: As mentioned above, I've seen this movie 7 times in the theatre and the last 2 of those, on the same day. Just to explain, I had the day off of school, and was to meet my friends at the now-defunct Valley West Mall's dollar theatre. Actually, it was Tuesday's 50 cent day. So, while waiting on my friends, who did not have the day off, I decided on seeing Pretty Woman for the sixth and final time during the early afternoon. Little did I know, they, too, wanted to see it, so I went to go with them to the same theatre screen, the same day, to see Pretty Woman a seventh time. Side Note II: Since I am a huge Superman fan, I wanted to break this 7x in the theatre record in 2006 with Superman Returns. Sadly, as much as I liked that movie (and wanted to more) I could only make it to 5 viewings. Here's to 2013's Man of Steel. I am going to try and break the record once more!

    Pretty Woman is a decent movie with a pretty simple,clich&eacute; story line,but there is a good cast.The movie is a chick flick,but they usually have some kind of conflict,Pretty Woman is just two hours of Richard Gere and Julia Roberts going to different places with each other and showing off how in love they are,although I did think both these actors gave their best to this simple,plain movie,and they definitely had good chemistry on set,and if it wasn't for their impressive acting,I would be giving this movie a much lower rating than 6. Edward Lewis (Richard Gere) falls in love with a prostitute (Julia Roberts) he meets at Beverly Hills and begins spoiling her with his wealth.

    To maintain their wholesome image, Walt Disney Studios released "Pretty Woman" under the umbrella of their ancillary company, Touchstone Pictures. But "Pretty Woman", a feature film about a prostitute who turns into a princess after meeting a Californian prince, is no more sleazy than Disney's animated films aimed at children. The message, values and narrative arcs are all the same. The plot? Richard Gere plays a millionaire who's depressed because "his father doesn't love him". Disillusioned, he prepares to dismantle and downsize his giant corporate empire. Luckily he meets a hooker played by Julia Roberts. He showers her in money, riches and fine clothes, she teaches him to be a kind, good businessman who "provides jobs to shipbuilders". She rescues him from depression and "bad" capitalism, he rescues her from the slums, prostitution and, ergo, "bad" capitalism. The couple no longer screw people over, be it as prostitutes or as corporate raiders, but engage in "moral transactions". They get married, live happily ever after and he builds warships. Like "Indecent Proposal", released around the same time, the super-wealthy are initially malevolent but reveal themselves to be caring and decent. Prostitution is good, clean, profitable, fun and "just another career choice". Women, as prostitutes, make their own decisions and are entirely independent, strong and in control of their bodies and choices. Softcore titillation is used, and the prevailing aesthetic is one which bows down to wealth, riches, materialism and money. The end goal is always monogamous marital bliss, women gladly debase themselves to be with their wealthy providers and love conquers all difficulties and is constant. Furthermore, super-rich princes are the male ideal and hookers with hearts of gold are the female ideal. Prostitution has no serious consequences, prostitution is glorified and takes place between free women and sensitive guys, and monogamous marriage, capitalism, patriarchy, and commodification are all endorsed. Elsewhere expensive finery masks amorality, men mould women into their own little dolls, corruption is unimportant (because everyone is corrupt, everyone's a whore, and so corruption is relative), corporate raiders care about people other than themselves (members from the urban poor, no less) and disparages in wealth, taste, experience and education are both cute and don't thwart romance. Compare this to Francois Truffaut's "The Soft Skin", where the provincial mannerisms of a similar woman are mocked by her aristocratic lover. To make the film work, Big Business must be glorified as much as prostitution. Gere's a Prince Charming, climbing towers to rescue his lady. Oddly, the film is adored by women. It very much represents a post-feminist stance; as all female desire is celebrated, the fantasy of winning a rich prince is super cool, even if this first means that a woman must first unconsciously self-identify as a "whore". Servitute is embraced because the self is redefined as feminine-consumer, allowed to window-shop for any and all desires, which in this case is implicitly connected to women's magazines, the fashion industry and the disciplined use of makeup, clothing, exercise etc. Everyone can be transformed from working girl to lady of leisure, everyone is allowed to dream of being valuable and feel valued, everyone is trained in the art of seduction, self-marketing, sexual gratification and consumer display. 4/10 - "My Fair Lady" meets "Cinderella" meets "Pygmalion". Worth one viewing.

    I like Julia Roberts but this was such a step backward for women. Come on seriously how could anyone think of this as a romance?? There were so many clich&eacute;s in this movie I began to wonder if it was just one big commercial for male body spray like Axe. Where could a relationship like this go? They going to have children? Hey Mom how did you and Dad meet? Oh I was hooking down on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and your Dad gave me $100 to spend the night with him. Isn't that sooo romantic. Blech! Imagine every time they get into an argument and he tells her she is just hooker anyway and should be happy with what she's got. Although, this film was made in the 90's it must have been written in the 50's back when men had some crazy control issues and wished they could just keep women down...oh wait a minute how much has really changed since then? This film is less of a Cinderella story for hookers and more of a Cinderfella story for "Johns".

    "Pretty Woman" is a lightweight but entertaining fairy tale about Prince Charming. Everything about director Garry Marshall's upbeat romantic comedy is as contrived as it is sugar coated from subversion of any sort. Although it received an R rating, this sappy two hour plus love story shows what happens to a handsome but heartless Wall Street titan when he encounters a savvy street prostitute in Beverly Hills and how their lives change radically for the better. Despite its predictable plot, "Pretty Woman" wins us over with the chemistry and charisma of the principals. Richard Gere plays protagonist Edward Lewis with wisdom and suavity. He is a businessman who buys companies and then breaks them up and sells them off. Consequently, the milk of human kindness doesn't flow in his blood. Sheer coincidence brings our hero face to face with the heroine, young but gorgeous, and "Pretty Woman" charts their fate together. Reportedly, scenarist J.T. Lawton's original script emphasized gutter realism over utter unreality. Marshall and his writers have sanded off all the rough edges. Our hero is in Los Angles when he discovers that his girlfriend is about to ditch him. He tries to drive a Lotus Esprit and nearly wrecks it. Kit and Vivian are prowling their share of the sidewalk when Edward cruises up and parks. Of course, he hasn't so much parked as jammed his car up so he cannot get it to run. He inquires for directions for Beverley Hills from her. He asks her afterward if she can drive the Lotus. They wind up at his Beverley Hills hotel and Edward buys Vivian for the night and then the week. He shells out thousands of dollars to get Vivian a proper wardrobe so she can accompany him in public and appear presentable. Chiefly, Edward wants to buy out a company that makes ships and sell it off, but the owner-founder, James Morse (Ralph Bellamy of "The Professionals") refuses to bow out without a fight. Edward did not have a good relationship with his own father Carson. Indeed, when Carter died, neither had spoken to each other in 14 and a half years. Initially, Edward savors the process of carving up Morse's company until he begins to see him as a human. Richard Gere and Julia Roberts make Edward and Vivian very palatable, very sexy, and very sympathetic. The happily ever after ending is contrived. Interestingly, the two principals move onto to better things. Ostensibly, Jason Alexander is delivers the best performance as Edward's cutthroat attorney, Philip Stuckey, who has been with him ten years. Philip's abrasive treatment of Vivian alienates Edward and he fires Philip. Hector Elizondo has a memorable supporting role as the hotel manager who helps Vivian with her wardrobe. There isn't a single character in this romantic comedy that has any depth or subtlety. Marshall relies on wardrobe to define his characters and neither the protagonist nor the heroine is ever in jeopardy. The Beverly Hills shopping scene when our heroine returns to Rodeo Driver is amusing. The people who made this diverting epic create characters that you find yourself rooting for and liking and the villains get their comeuppance.
