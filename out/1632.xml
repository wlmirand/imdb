    Land and Freedom begins with a death; ends with a death but is ultimately a celebration of one person's life. The film is all at once a realist drama, a political thriller and a war movie; Ken Loach's trademark v&eacute;rit&eacute; style dogging every cut; composition; transition and individual scene resulting in a near breathless film-watching experience of conflict, both of an internal and external sort, tribulation and strife. The film is very much The Spanish Civil War, as well as those of whom fought in it, through the eyes of Loach; an event of which, like several other background incidents that have since plagued Loach's work, such as Ireland's Independence throughout The Wind That Shakes the Barley; The Navigators, and its covering of men suffering at the result of British Rail's privatisation, but also albeit fleetingly, Looking for Eric's monopolisation of Manchester United football club, is melded into what is first and foremost a character study feeding off an intense sense of realism. Ian Hart eventually comes to play that of David Carr, a young Liverpudlian man of whom we first see in the then-present of the mid-nineties alone and in a bad way as he alone occupies his tower block apartment having suffered a heart attack. The tower block itself is a tad grimy; graffiti of a somewhat politically motivated sort plagues the stairs, stairs of which paramedics must ascend out of the fact the lift does not work and probably has not done so for some while. Alas, everyone, including that of his granddaughter whom discovered him, are too late to save our Dave and he dies from the heart attack; an event leading his young relative to uncover a tin in the apartment rife with trinkets and items that we will come to learn meant a great deal to him. The tin mostly contains Spanish memorabilia, and we are led into assuming the man to be somewhat political out of the miner's strike newspaper clippings he kept. Amidst the photos; the collections of dirt kept back and the letters we, through the granddaughter, build an image of David's experiences abroad at an important time in his life. Principally, the film is one long flashback with brief darts back to the present also arriving as we witness Dave's exploits in tandem with that of his granddaughter's uncovering of the facts; her character most probably discovering as much about the Spanish Civil War as Loach's intended audience are. In 1930's Liverpool, Carr is in his mid twenties and intermingles with the odd friend here and there when he isn't looking for work out of being unemployed or maintaining his Communist party roots. One day, a trip to a local cinema encompasses that of a propagandist newsreel and a talk by a Spanish politician, of whom has come over to inform those of specific political stances whom might be willing to fight with him, as a brooding situation in Spain develops. Seemingly desiring a life away from what foundations he has, Carr accepts what proposals are outlined that day in the darkened, enclosed locale of the picture-house and it isn't long before he is riding a train in northern Spain to the front-line of what is The Spanish Civil war raging between Conservatives, and those of a more leftist-nature on the political spectrum, against the Fascist might of Franco and his followers. There is a beautifully placed scene very early on in Carr's venture out there, an exchange on board a train as he makes his way across and through the somewhat barren northern parts of the country depicting him barely able to even say the Spanish word for "Thank you". This, not only a happening highlighting his raw and inexperienced nature to the locale, actually accentuates how much it means to those with whom he's intermingling when a train guard hears of the cause for his presence and offers him a free ticket on behalf of it. One thing leads to another, and he eventually links up with a rag-tag bunch of soldiers predominantly populated by Spaniards known as the 'POUM', a united workers party fighting the concurrent fascist sentiment. Through this group of people of varying nationalities and the nature of their cross cultural banding togetherness, the general disposition of the film's production is nicely surmised, as this piece formulating out of the resultant coming together of varying fellows combining for a cause. It is within this group that he meets an array of people, including that of local Spaniards; Frenchmen; the fiery Maite (Bolla&iacute;n) as well as Blanca (Pator), whom he eventually comes to feel rather fondly for. The film does an excellent job in channelling the nature of what warfare in the trenches, unfolding in this era may have been like; everything droll and unglamourous when it isn't bullet ridden, the better equipped enemy never feeling much more than not-so-far-away, with conflict and violence seemingly around most turns. Away from the sequences of conflict, which reach heady heights when the early storming of a nearby town plays out, the film is rife with really remarkably played sequences of heavy political involvement featuring the characters deliberating and speaking on the state of their nation and what ought to happen; the scenes so authentic in their unfolding, one could be forgiven for thinking one had been transported back in time and invited to a live chaired debate. The film is a remarkable drama, a war film in which the warfare slips away and into the background whilst the characters take centre stage; a film which beautifully sews in a love story amidst all the strife and generally makes for accomplished viewing.

    There is much said about this film and so I only want to point out one thing. It is the Stalinist propaganda that tells the story that the anarchists and trotskyst slaughtered thousands of priests and burned down nearly all the churches in Spain and because of that the deeply religious people of Spain turned against socialism and so it was necessary for the Soviet Union to purge the International Brigades and the different groups who fought for the republic. It's brilliant how Loach turn this Stalinist propaganda into an argument against Stalin and for the trotskyst POUM by showing that the priest who is killed, is a brutal fascists and that all non-fascist inhabitants of that village agree with the execution of that priest. With that scene Loach is saying that those people who are against the actions against the church are in fact that ones who don't get along with the opinion of the so called "deeply religious people of Spain". There are many more definite parts of the film against Stalinism but since I had a loud and heavy argument with a Stalinist about the Spanish Civil War I specially like this one.

    Land and Freedom is a film of Ken Loach about the Spanish Civil war. It is certainly a war film, with lots of battle scenes, but nevertheless quite distinct from the stereotype battlefield spectacle. This is partly due to the director Loach, who has neither the urge nor the financial means to produce a large-scale report on battle-fields. However the main reason is the civil war itself, since the republic (the good guys) was defended by a peoples army, and not a professional one. In fact we witness the experiences of a militia, consisting of normal grown-up citizens, not the juvenile cannon fodder, that is crowding the average WW2 or Vietnam movie. When in Land and Freedom the militia attacks the trenches of the fascist troops, it is not a furious storm but a wearisome advancement, evidently by people whose physical conditions could have been better. The firing with their rifles seems unaimed and chaotic. At first I thought this was a display of bad acting, but in fact it is just the opposite. For the militia was composed of volunteers with little or no military training or background. Loach says in an interview, that the film is a critique on the stance of the republicans during the war. The resistance started as a collaboration between anarchist, Bolshevist and social-democrat groups, but soon the ideological differences started to cause growing frictions. Not surprisingly the Bolshevists were once again hoping to replicate the October revolution and seize power during the conflict. On the other hand the anarchists and syndicalists rejected any form of organization, and fully relied on the innate peoples will. Loach made this debate into the essential thread of the film. The story is like this: it is 1936. The British Communist Party recruits volunteers for international reserves of the republican army. David, who is a member of the BCP and out of work, travels to Spain and joins a militia of the POUM (apparently a Trotzkyist-anarchist fraction in the Spanish government). The militia consists of Spaniards (including two women), Frenchmen, Britons, an American, a German etc. They stay together for more than a year, and are remarkably spared the grief of casualties. At that time, and even during WWII, warfare did not yet have the professional intensity of the battlefields in Irak or Afghanistan. They are just killing time in their trenches. Even when a village is stormed, that is occupied by fascist troops, the enemy is already on the run. The number of fallen comrades in this action equals just one, and there is plenty of time for grief and a decent burial. Subsequently the militia joins the villagers in a debate about socialization of the agricultural land! Really, that are the syndicalists for you, they seem almost like Taliban. In the mean time, the government in Madrid realizes that this kind of defense will not win the war. (it could have ended in a long-lasting partisan guerrilla, but apparently in his later years Franco was able to mobilize sufficient social support). They try to put anarchist fractions like the POUM on a sidetrack, and eventually the anarchist militia are disarmed. Of course during this operation the Bolshevists resort to the well-known Stalinist methods of terror, including tortures. David has developed a (physical) liking for the anarchist Blanca, and tears apart his booklet of membership of the BCP (with stamps indicating your monthly payments, those good old days). Typical of the spirit in the militia is one of the final scenes, where they once more storm a fascist trench. Here the fighting gets tough, and the militia leader calls his superior by phone in order to complain about the uncomfortable conditions. Several militia members want a debate in order to consider a withdrawal. Later, when a superior officer actually orders the militia leader to withdraw, the leader wants to start a debate (in the middle of a fight, over the phone!) about the inconsistency of the orders! I find this scene particularly brilliant, reflecting the films subtlety and sarcasm. By the way, although modern warfare delegates much more responsibilities to the troops in the fields, obedience still remains a paramount requirement. Eventually Blanca is shot dead, and David returns home as a disillusioned man. What a mess! Nevertheless, the film confirms that the fascist troops are still the Hoesseins, and the republicans are still the Blairs. People interested in the Spanish Civil war should also see the documentary "The Spanish Earth" of director Joris Ivens and the excellent war film (if you fancy them) "F&uuml;nf Patronenh&uuml;lsen" of director Frank Beyer (which includes the heart-rending Busch song "Die Jarama Front"!).

    This film is an artistic approach at a piece of history. Usually, the main event is Hitler's reign, but this film focuses on the beginning and the struggle against Stalin and fascism. Ian Hart does great as the lead, you will probably end up using IMDb to see his career unfold, and he's been in some famous films such as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Michael Collins, and Finding Neverland, but always a small role. It's good to see him in a lead role. Land and Freedom is a gem, a film from 1995 that isn't well-received in America, but I do hope others view it and enjoy it. At times it can be tedious with the different languages and political views, as well as lengthy conversations, but the setting is in 1936, there are no Aliens or Predators around, so do concentrate, it's well worth it. Cheers

    Land and Freedom is a British drama, directed by the English left-wing director Ken Loach, with a script written by playwright Jim Allen. His and Ken Loach's Marxist, Trotskyist, and anti-Stalinist orientations are evidently present in the film, although it is arguably the theme of Stalinist repression of anti-franquist communist and anarchist militias in Spain during the Civil War, to be mainly portrayed. In the end, given the several disputes and scuffles between the various anti-Franco factions, we wonder, with the director: What is the point to all this? The story develops through flashbacks, and it recounts of a David Carr, a British unemployed member of the Communist Party from Liverpool, who decides to go and fight the cause of the anti-franquist movement in the Spanish Civil War. The narration takes place through some letters Carr wrote, newspaper clippings, and other documents he collected, found and read by his granddaughter, right after his death. The film rides the wave of the leftoid socio-political movement of the 90's, as already mentioned in this blog, with regards to La Haine and, similarly to the French film, this socio-political situation contributes greatly to its success, especially amongst certain circles. Other themes present in the film are the anti-Clericalism, revealed with the summary execution of the priest culpable of exposing the militians to the Franquist; rudimentary feminism, given the fact that in the POUM, men and women fight together; and finally, the socialist matrix also appears, especially in the village assembly scene, where the peasants vote for the collectivization of the land. This scene is arguably one of the best of the entire movie; Loach's pursue of realism reaches its apex here. The camera loses its perspective, and plunges the viewer right into the live situation, and the dialogues are apt and poignant, also considering that most of the actors participating to this scene were non-professionals.

    The striking perspective in Ken Loach's films seems to be that the characters are just like us --- they are struggling to get clear and articulate their thoughts as they go along --- they haven't learned a smooth script. Ian Hart as Liverpudlian "Dave Carr" is marvellous; it could be you or me, on the ground right then and there, having to say something very important, and trying to convey it across another language. The reality of war and revolution, in which everyone has slightly different ideas, as opposed to being an absurdly 'unified' body, is starkly presented. I could have done without the sexism and swear words, though I've no doubt they were there too, especially among insecure men in macho roles. The "household debate" in the evicted landowner's house, is a marvel. I haven't read up the screenplay, but any viewer would swear that fifteen people were shoved (gently!) into that room and told to "debate it", with no guidance and no script --- but of course that's what all Loach films look like. Powerful; and the almost wordless granddaughter in Liverpool, appearing at the start and the end of the film --- Suzanne Maddock, is absolutely convincing: on the surface uninformed, but at the very end (I did tag the spoiler), her brief salute at the graveside bowled me over ---- powerful unexpected stuff.

    The picture begins in recent times when a granddaughter looking for papers aware her grandfather fought in Spanish War Civil (1936-1939) that is the subject matter of the movie. Then happens a long flashback where are developed the facts about David (Ian Hart), a working-class and unemployed young . He's an English communist who leaves Liverpool and comes to join the Republicans troops against the General Franco army . He joined the P.O.U.M. (Partido Obrero Unificacion Marxista) of Trosky ideology, for that reason are called Troskists. There he meets women fighters ( Rosana Pastor, Iciar Bollain) and the International brigades (Tom Gilroy). David befriends the militia people and fights in the trenches of the battles of Teruel and Ebro. David is wounded and while he's in Barcelona occurs confrontation between FAI, CNT anarchists followers of the leader Durruti (who gave name to the Column Durruti), regular troops of the Republican government, Stalinists and Troskists. Then David decides to return to his previous militia. This interesting historical story is a passionate retelling and a touching warlike drama. The film originated an intense discussion in Spain about its principal theme , the Spanish Civil War . However the intense debate about ownership of lands proceeded in pseudo-documentary style is overlong and dull. Adequate cinematography by Barry Ackroyd , Ken Loach's usual . Perceptible and sensible musical score by George Fenton. &uml;Land and freedom &uml; was a Spanish- British co-production and obtained much success in the Spain box-office . The film belongs a splendid trilogy by Ken Loach, developing historical deeds from a thoughtful point of sight , such as &uml;Hidden agenda&uml; and &uml;The wind that shakes the barley&uml;. The motion picture is professionally directed by Ken Loach. In the 90s he directed a series of award-winning movies firmly establishing him as one of the best European filmmakers with &uml;Riff-Raff&uml;, &uml;Raining stones&uml; and &uml;My name is Joe&uml; winning several prizes in Cannes, and of course &uml;Land and freedom&uml; which achieved the Ecumenical Prize and the International critics Prize at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival. In the 2000s, Loach went on his special landmark about socialist realism with &uml;Bread and Roses&uml;, &uml;The Navigators&uml;, &uml;Sweet sixteen&uml;, &uml;Just a kiss&uml;, and &uml;It's free world&uml;. This rich human drama appeal to Ken Loach enthusiasts and history buffs.

    With the time that has elapsed since the Spanish Civil War and the time that has also elapsed since this film came out, 1995, this film has probably completely changed in meaning and what's more it must be extremely far away from what the non-Spanish citizens who participated in the Civil War might have thought at the time and might have remembered afterwards. The film shows essentially military amateurism and political strife on the front, since there was a real front with Franco and professional armed forces on the other side, as well as in Barcelona. Three trends are shown though not always clearly identified: the communists often called Stalinists, the anarchists identified as the CNT and the POUM who is some kind of Trotskyite organization both anti-communist and anti-anarchist and at the same time for total revolution as fast as possible, with the full collectivization of land, and a high level of independence, autonomy, even the refusal of hierarchy and authority. It led to a catastrophe of course with Franco helped by Mussolini and Hitler, and the communists only helped by other communist parties with the International Brigades and by Stalin provided the Stalinist model was followed. That clearly led to defeat. But an explanation is not given in the film. It is too short to just say discord prevailed. Why did it prevail? There we cannot give one answer only. There are several and even many. At first the weight of the international situation that made Spain a stake of the near future between all the western European countries, Italy and Germany included, and thus a divided West that let Hitler and Mussolini do what they wanted without any restraint, on one side, and on the other side the Communist International and the USSR who were trying to impose a clear model: collectivization of land and nationalization of industry, along with a strong state organization with a professional military force. No sense of compromise, no desire to reach any kind of compromise. Add to that the role of the church and the deep anti-clerical feelings of some sections of this Spanish left. Don't forget the sexist bigotry of a deeply catholic country and people: the equality of women could not last very long. That led to a civil war within the civil war and the defeat was guaranteed. But do not believe this film does not speak to us today, in the time of Obama in a globalized world in the midst of a financial crisis. The left is totally unable to find a complete unity on a realistic project and they have been systematically side-tracked in the recent or not so recent years in France or Italy or Greece. Spain is an exception, but probably not for long. The question that emerges from the film is: Was the social revolution advocated by these various revolutionary factions a realistic objective? Was it the real way History was going to take? I must admit the picture that comes out of this film makes me doubt it very much, especially twenty years after the fall of the last European communist experimentation. It feels as if that project was doomed to fail because of its unrealistic final objective, as well as the short term and middle term stages of that program. But there is a strong fragrance of absurdity in the depicted situation. They try to force history, accelerate it, in a way rape it, and history goes against that violation that can only work with a strong unity of the people behind that strong line and with a strong political and military power in the hands of the unified  or purified  leadership of the transformation, and yet for how long before a serious reform or final defeat? Sad but still true: those who try to violate history and its own pace, be they on the right or on the left, are totally blind to the fact that history does not follow a strict agenda and does not move along a straight line.

    This is a very powerful film, but it helps if the viewer has some background knowledge of the subject. The film is very serious and very political, and the Spanish Civil War was inextricably bound up with politics, both national and international. This is not an easy film to watch, because the subject is a painful one for the Loyalist supporter, as the original spirit of the working class people fighting fascism gives way to internal power struggles and hopeless division. As the young leftist hero writes to his girlfriend back in England, " The Fascists must be having a bloody good laugh at us". There is some welcome relief in the form of bawdy humor and tender romance, but the sense of tragedy forever linked to the war in Spain is unavoidable. The movie ends on a note of recognition of heroism and sacrifice that is quietly effective. Well worth seeing, for anyone interested in the history, or just a good drama of love and war.

    This film is structured basically the same way as Loach's most recent work, "The Wind that Shakes the Barley": a group of people manage to successfully win a battle against an enemy regime, and then starts to faction and dissolve slowly, eventually culminating in tragedy. "Land and Freedom", however, is a bit stronger and a lot smarter. It's obvious from these two movies that Loach is a leftist, but unlike most people who make political works for one side or the other, Loach has a strong understanding of the failings and weaknesses of his own politics. His movies often have moments of straightforward political debate, but he never lets any side seem less important than any other. He is one of those rare people who can analyze all of the issues from many directions, and underline the most important parts of what each side needs and what each side can't have. Loach also has a technique of making initial moments of militarism or violence seem rather childlike, like boys with toy guns running through hillsides and enjoying each other's company. These moments always precede direct damage to members of the group, and in "Land and Freedom", seeing the militia slowly fall apart is very disturbing. Loach also cleverly illustrates the difficulties of revolution from the perspective of the volunteers, as they start fighting for one cause and then find themselves on the opposite end of the barrel against their friends and neighbors. I've only recently begun watching the movies of Ken Loach, but I really admire the way he writes and directs his movies. He is definitely a very important filmmaker. --PolarisDiB

Ian Hart eventually comes to play that of David Carr, a young Liverpudlian man of whom we first see in the then-present of the mid-nineties alone and in a bad way as he alone occupies his tower block apartment having suffered a heart attack. The tower block itself is a tad grimy; graffiti of a somewhat politically motivated sort plagues the stairs, stairs of which paramedics must ascend out of the fact the lift does not work and probably has not done so for some while. Alas, everyone, including that of his granddaughter whom discovered him, are too late to save our Dave and he dies from the heart attack; an event leading his young relative to uncover a tin in the apartment rife with trinkets and items that we will come to learn meant a great deal to him.

The film does an excellent job in channelling the nature of what warfare in the trenches, unfolding in this era may have been like; everything droll and unglamourous when it isn't bullet ridden, the better equipped enemy never feeling much more than not-so-far-away, with conflict and violence seemingly around most turns. Away from the sequences of conflict, which reach heady heights when the early storming of a nearby town plays out, the film is rife with really remarkably played sequences of heavy political involvement featuring the characters deliberating and speaking on the state of their nation and what ought to happen; the scenes so authentic in their unfolding, one could be forgiven for thinking one had been transported back in time and invited to a live chaired debate. The film is a remarkable drama, a war film in which the warfare slips away and into the background whilst the characters take centre stage; a film which beautifully sews in a love story amidst all the strife and generally makes for accomplished viewing.

    There is much said about this film and so I only want to point out one thing. It is the Stalinist propaganda that tells the story that the anarchists and trotskyst slaughtered thousands of priests and burned down nearly all the churches in Spain and because of that the deeply religious people of Spain turned against socialism and so it was necessary for the Soviet Union to purge the International Brigades and the different groups who fought for the republic. It's brilliant how Loach turn this Stalinist propaganda into an argument against Stalin and for the trotskyst POUM by showing that the priest who is killed, is a brutal fascists and that all non-fascist inhabitants of that village agree with the execution of that priest. With that scene Loach is saying that those people who are against the actions against the church are in fact that ones who don't get along with the opinion of the so called "deeply religious people of Spain". There are many more definite parts of the film against Stalinism but since I had a loud and heavy argument with a Stalinist about the Spanish Civil War I specially like this one.

    Land and Freedom is a film of Ken Loach about the Spanish Civil war. It is certainly a war film, with lots of battle scenes, but nevertheless quite distinct from the stereotype battlefield spectacle. This is partly due to the director Loach, who has neither the urge nor the financial means to produce a large-scale report on battle-fields. However the main reason is the civil war itself, since the republic (the good guys) was defended by a peoples army, and not a professional one. In fact we witness the experiences of a militia, consisting of normal grown-up citizens, not the juvenile cannon fodder, that is crowding the average WW2 or Vietnam movie. When in Land and Freedom the militia attacks the trenches of the fascist troops, it is not a furious storm but a wearisome advancement, evidently by people whose physical conditions could have been better. The firing with their rifles seems unaimed and chaotic. At first I thought this was a display of bad acting, but in fact it is just the opposite. For the militia was composed of volunteers with little or no military training or background. Loach says in an interview, that the film is a critique on the stance of the republicans during the war. The resistance started as a collaboration between anarchist, Bolshevist and social-democrat groups, but soon the ideological differences started to cause growing frictions. Not surprisingly the Bolshevists were once again hoping to replicate the October revolution and seize power during the conflict. On the other hand the anarchists and syndicalists rejected any form of organization, and fully relied on the innate peoples will. Loach made this debate into the essential thread of the film. The story is like this: it is 1936. The British Communist Party recruits volunteers for international reserves of the republican army. David, who is a member of the BCP and out of work, travels to Spain and joins a militia of the POUM (apparently a Trotzkyist-anarchist fraction in the Spanish government). The militia consists of Spaniards (including two women), Frenchmen, Britons, an American, a German etc. They stay together for more than a year, and are remarkably spared the grief of casualties. At that time, and even during WWII, warfare did not yet have the professional intensity of the battlefields in Irak or Afghanistan. They are just killing time in their trenches. Even when a village is stormed, that is occupied by fascist troops, the enemy is already on the run. The number of fallen comrades in this action equals just one, and there is plenty of time for grief and a decent burial. Subsequently the militia joins the villagers in a debate about socialization of the agricultural land! Really, that are the syndicalists for you, they seem almost like Taliban. In the mean time, the government in Madrid realizes that this kind of defense will not win the war. (it could have ended in a long-lasting partisan guerrilla, but apparently in his later years Franco was able to mobilize sufficient social support). They try to put anarchist fractions like the POUM on a sidetrack, and eventually the anarchist militia are disarmed. Of course during this operation the Bolshevists resort to the well-known Stalinist methods of terror, including tortures. David has developed a (physical) liking for the anarchist Blanca, and tears apart his booklet of membership of the BCP (with stamps indicating your monthly payments, those good old days). Typical of the spirit in the militia is one of the final scenes, where they once more storm a fascist trench. Here the fighting gets tough, and the militia leader calls his superior by phone in order to complain about the uncomfortable conditions. Several militia members want a debate in order to consider a withdrawal. Later, when a superior officer actually orders the militia leader to withdraw, the leader wants to start a debate (in the middle of a fight, over the phone!) about the inconsistency of the orders! I find this scene particularly brilliant, reflecting the films subtlety and sarcasm. By the way, although modern warfare delegates much more responsibilities to the troops in the fields, obedience still remains a paramount requirement. Eventually Blanca is shot dead, and David returns home as a disillusioned man. What a mess! Nevertheless, the film confirms that the fascist troops are still the Hoesseins, and the republicans are still the Blairs. People interested in the Spanish Civil war should also see the documentary "The Spanish Earth" of director Joris Ivens and the excellent war film (if you fancy them) "F&uuml;nf Patronenh&uuml;lsen" of director Frank Beyer (which includes the heart-rending Busch song "Die Jarama Front"!).

    This film is an artistic approach at a piece of history. Usually, the main event is Hitler's reign, but this film focuses on the beginning and the struggle against Stalin and fascism. Ian Hart does great as the lead, you will probably end up using IMDb to see his career unfold, and he's been in some famous films such as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Michael Collins, and Finding Neverland, but always a small role. It's good to see him in a lead role. Land and Freedom is a gem, a film from 1995 that isn't well-received in America, but I do hope others view it and enjoy it. At times it can be tedious with the different languages and political views, as well as lengthy conversations, but the setting is in 1936, there are no Aliens or Predators around, so do concentrate, it's well worth it. Cheers

    Land and Freedom is a British drama, directed by the English left-wing director Ken Loach, with a script written by playwright Jim Allen. His and Ken Loach's Marxist, Trotskyist, and anti-Stalinist orientations are evidently present in the film, although it is arguably the theme of Stalinist repression of anti-franquist communist and anarchist militias in Spain during the Civil War, to be mainly portrayed. In the end, given the several disputes and scuffles between the various anti-Franco factions, we wonder, with the director: What is the point to all this? The story develops through flashbacks, and it recounts of a David Carr, a British unemployed member of the Communist Party from Liverpool, who decides to go and fight the cause of the anti-franquist movement in the Spanish Civil War. The narration takes place through some letters Carr wrote, newspaper clippings, and other documents he collected, found and read by his granddaughter, right after his death. The film rides the wave of the leftoid socio-political movement of the 90's, as already mentioned in this blog, with regards to La Haine and, similarly to the French film, this socio-political situation contributes greatly to its success, especially amongst certain circles. Other themes present in the film are the anti-Clericalism, revealed with the summary execution of the priest culpable of exposing the militians to the Franquist; rudimentary feminism, given the fact that in the POUM, men and women fight together; and finally, the socialist matrix also appears, especially in the village assembly scene, where the peasants vote for the collectivization of the land. This scene is arguably one of the best of the entire movie; Loach's pursue of realism reaches its apex here. The camera loses its perspective, and plunges the viewer right into the live situation, and the dialogues are apt and poignant, also considering that most of the actors participating to this scene were non-professionals.

    The striking perspective in Ken Loach's films seems to be that the characters are just like us --- they are struggling to get clear and articulate their thoughts as they go along --- they haven't learned a smooth script. Ian Hart as Liverpudlian "Dave Carr" is marvellous; it could be you or me, on the ground right then and there, having to say something very important, and trying to convey it across another language. The reality of war and revolution, in which everyone has slightly different ideas, as opposed to being an absurdly 'unified' body, is starkly presented. I could have done without the sexism and swear words, though I've no doubt they were there too, especially among insecure men in macho roles. The "household debate" in the evicted landowner's house, is a marvel. I haven't read up the screenplay, but any viewer would swear that fifteen people were shoved (gently!) into that room and told to "debate it", with no guidance and no script --- but of course that's what all Loach films look like. Powerful; and the almost wordless granddaughter in Liverpool, appearing at the start and the end of the film --- Suzanne Maddock, is absolutely convincing: on the surface uninformed, but at the very end (I did tag the spoiler), her brief salute at the graveside bowled me over ---- powerful unexpected stuff.

    The picture begins in recent times when a granddaughter looking for papers aware her grandfather fought in Spanish War Civil (1936-1939) that is the subject matter of the movie. Then happens a long flashback where are developed the facts about David (Ian Hart), a working-class and unemployed young . He's an English communist who leaves Liverpool and comes to join the Republicans troops against the General Franco army . He joined the P.O.U.M. (Partido Obrero Unificacion Marxista) of Trosky ideology, for that reason are called Troskists. There he meets women fighters ( Rosana Pastor, Iciar Bollain) and the International brigades (Tom Gilroy). David befriends the militia people and fights in the trenches of the battles of Teruel and Ebro. David is wounded and while he's in Barcelona occurs confrontation between FAI, CNT anarchists followers of the leader Durruti (who gave name to the Column Durruti), regular troops of the Republican government, Stalinists and Troskists. Then David decides to return to his previous militia. This interesting historical story is a passionate retelling and a touching warlike drama. The film originated an intense discussion in Spain about its principal theme , the Spanish Civil War . However the intense debate about ownership of lands proceeded in pseudo-documentary style is overlong and dull. Adequate cinematography by Barry Ackroyd , Ken Loach's usual . Perceptible and sensible musical score by George Fenton. &uml;Land and freedom &uml; was a Spanish- British co-production and obtained much success in the Spain box-office . The film belongs a splendid trilogy by Ken Loach, developing historical deeds from a thoughtful point of sight , such as &uml;Hidden agenda&uml; and &uml;The wind that shakes the barley&uml;. The motion picture is professionally directed by Ken Loach. In the 90s he directed a series of award-winning movies firmly establishing him as one of the best European filmmakers with &uml;Riff-Raff&uml;, &uml;Raining stones&uml; and &uml;My name is Joe&uml; winning several prizes in Cannes, and of course &uml;Land and freedom&uml; which achieved the Ecumenical Prize and the International critics Prize at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival. In the 2000s, Loach went on his special landmark about socialist realism with &uml;Bread and Roses&uml;, &uml;The Navigators&uml;, &uml;Sweet sixteen&uml;, &uml;Just a kiss&uml;, and &uml;It's free world&uml;. This rich human drama appeal to Ken Loach enthusiasts and history buffs.

    With the time that has elapsed since the Spanish Civil War and the time that has also elapsed since this film came out, 1995, this film has probably completely changed in meaning and what's more it must be extremely far away from what the non-Spanish citizens who participated in the Civil War might have thought at the time and might have remembered afterwards. The film shows essentially military amateurism and political strife on the front, since there was a real front with Franco and professional armed forces on the other side, as well as in Barcelona. Three trends are shown though not always clearly identified: the communists often called Stalinists, the anarchists identified as the CNT and the POUM who is some kind of Trotskyite organization both anti-communist and anti-anarchist and at the same time for total revolution as fast as possible, with the full collectivization of land, and a high level of independence, autonomy, even the refusal of hierarchy and authority. It led to a catastrophe of course with Franco helped by Mussolini and Hitler, and the communists only helped by other communist parties with the International Brigades and by Stalin provided the Stalinist model was followed. That clearly led to defeat. But an explanation is not given in the film. It is too short to just say discord prevailed. Why did it prevail? There we cannot give one answer only. There are several and even many. At first the weight of the international situation that made Spain a stake of the near future between all the western European countries, Italy and Germany included, and thus a divided West that let Hitler and Mussolini do what they wanted without any restraint, on one side, and on the other side the Communist International and the USSR who were trying to impose a clear model: collectivization of land and nationalization of industry, along with a strong state organization with a professional military force. No sense of compromise, no desire to reach any kind of compromise. Add to that the role of the church and the deep anti-clerical feelings of some sections of this Spanish left. Don't forget the sexist bigotry of a deeply catholic country and people: the equality of women could not last very long. That led to a civil war within the civil war and the defeat was guaranteed. But do not believe this film does not speak to us today, in the time of Obama in a globalized world in the midst of a financial crisis. The left is totally unable to find a complete unity on a realistic project and they have been systematically side-tracked in the recent or not so recent years in France or Italy or Greece. Spain is an exception, but probably not for long. The question that emerges from the film is: Was the social revolution advocated by these various revolutionary factions a realistic objective? Was it the real way History was going to take? I must admit the picture that comes out of this film makes me doubt it very much, especially twenty years after the fall of the last European communist experimentation. It feels as if that project was doomed to fail because of its unrealistic final objective, as well as the short term and middle term stages of that program. But there is a strong fragrance of absurdity in the depicted situation. They try to force history, accelerate it, in a way rape it, and history goes against that violation that can only work with a strong unity of the people behind that strong line and with a strong political and military power in the hands of the unified  or purified  leadership of the transformation, and yet for how long before a serious reform or final defeat? Sad but still true: those who try to violate history and its own pace, be they on the right or on the left, are totally blind to the fact that history does not follow a strict agenda and does not move along a straight line.

    This is a very powerful film, but it helps if the viewer has some background knowledge of the subject. The film is very serious and very political, and the Spanish Civil War was inextricably bound up with politics, both national and international. This is not an easy film to watch, because the subject is a painful one for the Loyalist supporter, as the original spirit of the working class people fighting fascism gives way to internal power struggles and hopeless division. As the young leftist hero writes to his girlfriend back in England, " The Fascists must be having a bloody good laugh at us". There is some welcome relief in the form of bawdy humor and tender romance, but the sense of tragedy forever linked to the war in Spain is unavoidable. The movie ends on a note of recognition of heroism and sacrifice that is quietly effective. Well worth seeing, for anyone interested in the history, or just a good drama of love and war.

    This film is structured basically the same way as Loach's most recent work, "The Wind that Shakes the Barley": a group of people manage to successfully win a battle against an enemy regime, and then starts to faction and dissolve slowly, eventually culminating in tragedy. "Land and Freedom", however, is a bit stronger and a lot smarter. It's obvious from these two movies that Loach is a leftist, but unlike most people who make political works for one side or the other, Loach has a strong understanding of the failings and weaknesses of his own politics. His movies often have moments of straightforward political debate, but he never lets any side seem less important than any other. He is one of those rare people who can analyze all of the issues from many directions, and underline the most important parts of what each side needs and what each side can't have. Loach also has a technique of making initial moments of militarism or violence seem rather childlike, like boys with toy guns running through hillsides and enjoying each other's company. These moments always precede direct damage to members of the group, and in "Land and Freedom", seeing the militia slowly fall apart is very disturbing. Loach also cleverly illustrates the difficulties of revolution from the perspective of the volunteers, as they start fighting for one cause and then find themselves on the opposite end of the barrel against their friends and neighbors. I've only recently begun watching the movies of Ken Loach, but I really admire the way he writes and directs his movies. He is definitely a very important filmmaker. --PolarisDiB

    Land and Freedom begins with a death; ends with a death but is ultimately a celebration of one person's life. The film is all at once a realist drama, a political thriller and a war movie; Ken Loach's trademark v&eacute;rit&eacute; style dogging every cut; composition; transition and individual scene resulting in a near breathless film-watching experience of conflict, both of an internal and external sort, tribulation and strife. The film is very much The Spanish Civil War, as well as those of whom fought in it, through the eyes of Loach; an event of which, like several other background incidents that have since plagued Loach's work, such as Ireland's Independence throughout The Wind That Shakes the Barley; The Navigators, and its covering of men suffering at the result of British Rail's privatisation, but also albeit fleetingly, Looking for Eric's monopolisation of Manchester United football club, is melded into what is first and foremost a character study feeding off an intense sense of realism. Ian Hart eventually comes to play that of David Carr, a young Liverpudlian man of whom we first see in the then-present of the mid-nineties alone and in a bad way as he alone occupies his tower block apartment having suffered a heart attack. The tower block itself is a tad grimy; graffiti of a somewhat politically motivated sort plagues the stairs, stairs of which paramedics must ascend out of the fact the lift does not work and probably has not done so for some while. Alas, everyone, including that of his granddaughter whom discovered him, are too late to save our Dave and he dies from the heart attack; an event leading his young relative to uncover a tin in the apartment rife with trinkets and items that we will come to learn meant a great deal to him. The tin mostly contains Spanish memorabilia, and we are led into assuming the man to be somewhat political out of the miner's strike newspaper clippings he kept. Amidst the photos; the collections of dirt kept back and the letters we, through the granddaughter, build an image of David's experiences abroad at an important time in his life. Principally, the film is one long flashback with brief darts back to the present also arriving as we witness Dave's exploits in tandem with that of his granddaughter's uncovering of the facts; her character most probably discovering as much about the Spanish Civil War as Loach's intended audience are. In 1930's Liverpool, Carr is in his mid twenties and intermingles with the odd friend here and there when he isn't looking for work out of being unemployed or maintaining his Communist party roots. One day, a trip to a local cinema encompasses that of a propagandist newsreel and a talk by a Spanish politician, of whom has come over to inform those of specific political stances whom might be willing to fight with him, as a brooding situation in Spain develops. Seemingly desiring a life away from what foundations he has, Carr accepts what proposals are outlined that day in the darkened, enclosed locale of the picture-house and it isn't long before he is riding a train in northern Spain to the front-line of what is The Spanish Civil war raging between Conservatives, and those of a more leftist-nature on the political spectrum, against the Fascist might of Franco and his followers. There is a beautifully placed scene very early on in Carr's venture out there, an exchange on board a train as he makes his way across and through the somewhat barren northern parts of the country depicting him barely able to even say the Spanish word for "Thank you". This, not only a happening highlighting his raw and inexperienced nature to the locale, actually accentuates how much it means to those with whom he's intermingling when a train guard hears of the cause for his presence and offers him a free ticket on behalf of it. One thing leads to another, and he eventually links up with a rag-tag bunch of soldiers predominantly populated by Spaniards known as the 'POUM', a united workers party fighting the concurrent fascist sentiment. Through this group of people of varying nationalities and the nature of their cross cultural banding togetherness, the general disposition of the film's production is nicely surmised, as this piece formulating out of the resultant coming together of varying fellows combining for a cause. It is within this group that he meets an array of people, including that of local Spaniards; Frenchmen; the fiery Maite (Bolla&iacute;n) as well as Blanca (Pator), whom he eventually comes to feel rather fondly for. The film does an excellent job in channelling the nature of what warfare in the trenches, unfolding in this era may have been like; everything droll and unglamourous when it isn't bullet ridden, the better equipped enemy never feeling much more than not-so-far-away, with conflict and violence seemingly around most turns. Away from the sequences of conflict, which reach heady heights when the early storming of a nearby town plays out, the film is rife with really remarkably played sequences of heavy political involvement featuring the characters deliberating and speaking on the state of their nation and what ought to happen; the scenes so authentic in their unfolding, one could be forgiven for thinking one had been transported back in time and invited to a live chaired debate. The film is a remarkable drama, a war film in which the warfare slips away and into the background whilst the characters take centre stage; a film which beautifully sews in a love story amidst all the strife and generally makes for accomplished viewing.

    This film is an artistic approach at a piece of history. Usually, the main event is Hitler's reign, but this film focuses on the beginning and the struggle against Stalin and fascism. Ian Hart does great as the lead, you will probably end up using IMDb to see his career unfold, and he's been in some famous films such as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Michael Collins, and Finding Neverland, but always a small role. It's good to see him in a lead role. Land and Freedom is a gem, a film from 1995 that isn't well-received in America, but I do hope others view it and enjoy it. At times it can be tedious with the different languages and political views, as well as lengthy conversations, but the setting is in 1936, there are no Aliens or Predators around, so do concentrate, it's well worth it.

    Land and Freedom is a British drama, directed by the English left-wing director Ken Loach, with a script written by playwright Jim Allen. His and Ken Loach's Marxist, Trotskyist, and anti-Stalinist orientations are evidently present in the film, although it is arguably the theme of Stalinist repression of anti-franquist communist and anarchist militias in Spain during the Civil War, to be mainly portrayed. In the end, given the several disputes and scuffles between the various anti-Franco factions, we wonder, with the director: What is the point to all this? The story develops through flashbacks, and it recounts of a David Carr, a British unemployed member of the Communist Party from Liverpool, who decides to go and fight the cause of the anti-franquist movement in the Spanish Civil War. The narration takes place through some letters Carr wrote, newspaper clippings, and other documents he collected, found and read by his granddaughter, right after his death. The film rides the wave of the leftoid socio-political movement of the 90's, as already mentioned in this blog, with regards to La Haine and, similarly to the French film, this socio-political situation contributes greatly to its success, especially amongst certain circles. Other themes present in the film are the anti-Clericalism, revealed with the summary execution of the priest culpable of exposing the militians to the Franquist; rudimentary feminism, given the fact that in the POUM, men and women fight together; and finally, the socialist matrix also appears, especially in the village assembly scene, where the peasants vote for the collectivization of the land. This scene is arguably one of the best of the entire movie; Loach's pursue of realism reaches its apex here. The camera loses its perspective, and plunges the viewer right into the live situation, and the dialogues are apt and poignant, also considering that most of the actors participating to this scene were non-professionals.

    The striking perspective in Ken Loach's films seems to be that the characters are just like us --- they are struggling to get clear and articulate their thoughts as they go along --- they haven't learned a smooth script. Ian Hart as Liverpudlian "Dave Carr" is marvellous; it could be you or me, on the ground right then and there, having to say something very important, and trying to convey it across another language. The reality of war and revolution, in which everyone has slightly different ideas, as opposed to being an absurdly 'unified' body, is starkly presented. I could have done without the sexism and swear words, though I've no doubt they were there too, especially among insecure men in macho roles. The "household debate" in the evicted landowner's house, is a marvel. I haven't read up the screenplay, but any viewer would swear that fifteen people were shoved (gently!) into that room and told to "debate it", with no guidance and no script --- but of course that's what all Loach films look like. Powerful; and the almost wordless granddaughter in Liverpool, appearing at the start and the end of the film --- Suzanne Maddock, is absolutely convincing: on the surface uninformed, but at the very end (I did tag the spoiler), her brief salute at the graveside bowled me over ---- powerful unexpected stuff.

    The picture begins in recent times when a granddaughter looking for papers aware her grandfather fought in Spanish War Civil (1936-1939) that is the subject matter of the movie. Then happens a long flashback where are developed the facts about David (Ian Hart), a working-class and unemployed young . He's an English communist who leaves Liverpool and comes to join the Republicans troops against the General Franco army . He joined the P.O.U.M. (Partido Obrero Unificacion Marxista) of Trosky ideology, for that reason are called Troskists. There he meets women fighters ( Rosana Pastor, Iciar Bollain) and the International brigades (Tom Gilroy). David befriends the militia people and fights in the trenches of the battles of Teruel and Ebro. David is wounded and while he's in Barcelona occurs confrontation between FAI, CNT anarchists followers of the leader Durruti (who gave name to the Column Durruti), regular troops of the Republican government, Stalinists and Troskists. Then David decides to return to his previous militia. This interesting historical story is a passionate retelling and a touching warlike drama. The film originated an intense discussion in Spain about its principal theme , the Spanish Civil War . However the intense debate about ownership of lands proceeded in pseudo-documentary style is overlong and dull. Adequate cinematography by Barry Ackroyd , Ken Loach's usual . Perceptible and sensible musical score by George Fenton. &uml;Land and freedom &uml; was a Spanish- British co-production and obtained much success in the Spain box-office . The film belongs a splendid trilogy by Ken Loach, developing historical deeds from a thoughtful point of sight , such as &uml;Hidden agenda&uml; and &uml;The wind that shakes the barley&uml;. The motion picture is professionally directed by Ken Loach. In the 90s he directed a series of award-winning movies firmly establishing him as one of the best European filmmakers with &uml;Riff-Raff&uml;, &uml;Raining stones&uml; and &uml;My name is Joe&uml; winning several prizes in Cannes, and of course &uml;Land and freedom&uml; which achieved the Ecumenical Prize and the International critics Prize at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival. In the 2000s, Loach went on his special landmark about socialist realism with &uml;Bread and Roses&uml;, &uml;The Navigators&uml;, &uml;Sweet sixteen&uml;, &uml;Just a kiss&uml;, and &uml;It's free world&uml;. This rich human drama appeal to Ken Loach enthusiasts and history buffs.

    With the time that has elapsed since the Spanish Civil War and the time that has also elapsed since this film came out, 1995, this film has probably completely changed in meaning and what's more it must be extremely far away from what the non-Spanish citizens who participated in the Civil War might have thought at the time and might have remembered afterwards. The film shows essentially military amateurism and political strife on the front, since there was a real front with Franco and professional armed forces on the other side, as well as in Barcelona. Three trends are shown though not always clearly identified: the communists often called Stalinists, the anarchists identified as the CNT and the POUM who is some kind of Trotskyite organization both anti-communist and anti-anarchist and at the same time for total revolution as fast as possible, with the full collectivization of land, and a high level of independence, autonomy, even the refusal of hierarchy and authority. It led to a catastrophe of course with Franco helped by Mussolini and Hitler, and the communists only helped by other communist parties with the International Brigades and by Stalin provided the Stalinist model was followed. That clearly led to defeat. But an explanation is not given in the film. It is too short to just say discord prevailed. Why did it prevail? There we cannot give one answer only. There are several and even many. At first the weight of the international situation that made Spain a stake of the near future between all the western European countries, Italy and Germany included, and thus a divided West that let Hitler and Mussolini do what they wanted without any restraint, on one side, and on the other side the Communist International and the USSR who were trying to impose a clear model: collectivization of land and nationalization of industry, along with a strong state organization with a professional military force. No sense of compromise, no desire to reach any kind of compromise. Add to that the role of the church and the deep anti-clerical feelings of some sections of this Spanish left. Don't forget the sexist bigotry of a deeply catholic country and people: the equality of women could not last very long. That led to a civil war within the civil war and the defeat was guaranteed. But do not believe this film does not speak to us today, in the time of Obama in a globalized world in the midst of a financial crisis. The left is totally unable to find a complete unity on a realistic project and they have been systematically side-tracked in the recent or not so recent years in France or Italy or Greece. Spain is an exception, but probably not for long. The question that emerges from the film is: Was the social revolution advocated by these various revolutionary factions a realistic objective? Was it the real way History was going to take? I must admit the picture that comes out of this film makes me doubt it very much, especially twenty years after the fall of the last European communist experimentation. It feels as if that project was doomed to fail because of its unrealistic final objective, as well as the short term and middle term stages of that program. But there is a strong fragrance of absurdity in the depicted situation. They try to force history, accelerate it, in a way rape it, and history goes against that violation that can only work with a strong unity of the people behind that strong line and with a strong political and military power in the hands of the unified  or purified  leadership of the transformation, and yet for how long before a serious reform or final defeat? Sad but still true: those who try to violate history and its own pace, be they on the right or on the left, are totally blind to the fact that history does not follow a strict agenda and does not move along a straight line.

    This is a very powerful film, but it helps if the viewer has some background knowledge of the subject. The film is very serious and very political, and the Spanish Civil War was inextricably bound up with politics, both national and international. This is not an easy film to watch, because the subject is a painful one for the Loyalist supporter, as the original spirit of the working class people fighting fascism gives way to internal power struggles and hopeless division. As the young leftist hero writes to his girlfriend back in England, " The Fascists must be having a bloody good laugh at us". There is some welcome relief in the form of bawdy humor and tender romance, but the sense of tragedy forever linked to the war in Spain is unavoidable. The movie ends on a note of recognition of heroism and sacrifice that is quietly effective. Well worth seeing, for anyone interested in the history, or just a good drama of love and war.

    This film is structured basically the same way as Loach's most recent work, "The Wind that Shakes the Barley": a group of people manage to successfully win a battle against an enemy regime, and then starts to faction and dissolve slowly, eventually culminating in tragedy. "Land and Freedom", however, is a bit stronger and a lot smarter. It's obvious from these two movies that Loach is a leftist, but unlike most people who make political works for one side or the other, Loach has a strong understanding of the failings and weaknesses of his own politics. His movies often have moments of straightforward political debate, but he never lets any side seem less important than any other. He is one of those rare people who can analyze all of the issues from many directions, and underline the most important parts of what each side needs and what each side can't have. Loach also has a technique of making initial moments of militarism or violence seem rather childlike, like boys with toy guns running through hillsides and enjoying each other's company. These moments always precede direct damage to members of the group, and in "Land and Freedom", seeing the militia slowly fall apart is very disturbing. Loach also cleverly illustrates the difficulties of revolution from the perspective of the volunteers, as they start fighting for one cause and then find themselves on the opposite end of the barrel against their friends and neighbors. I've only recently begun watching the movies of Ken Loach, but I really admire the way he writes and directs his movies. He is definitely a very important filmmaker. --PolarisDiB

    Land and Freedom begins with a death; ends with a death but is ultimately a celebration of one person's life. The film is all at once a realist drama, a political thriller and a war movie; Ken Loach's trademark v&eacute;rit&eacute; style dogging every cut; composition; transition and individual scene resulting in a near breathless film-watching experience of conflict, both of an internal and external sort, tribulation and strife. The film is very much The Spanish Civil War, as well as those of whom fought in it, through the eyes of Loach; an event of which, like several other background incidents that have since plagued Loach's work, such as Ireland's Independence throughout The Wind That Shakes the Barley; The Navigators, and its covering of men suffering at the result of British Rail's privatisation, but also albeit fleetingly, Looking for Eric's monopolisation of Manchester United football club, is melded into what is first and foremost a character study feeding off an intense sense of realism. Ian Hart eventually comes to play that of David Carr, a young Liverpudlian man of whom we first see in the then-present of the mid-nineties alone and in a bad way as he alone occupies his tower block apartment having suffered a heart attack. The tower block itself is a tad grimy; graffiti of a somewhat politically motivated sort plagues the stairs, stairs of which paramedics must ascend out of the fact the lift does not work and probably has not done so for some while. Alas, everyone, including that of his granddaughter whom discovered him, are too late to save our Dave and he dies from the heart attack; an event leading his young relative to uncover a tin in the apartment rife with trinkets and items that we will come to learn meant a great deal to him. The tin mostly contains Spanish memorabilia, and we are led into assuming the man to be somewhat political out of the miner's strike newspaper clippings he kept. Amidst the photos; the collections of dirt kept back and the letters we, through the granddaughter, build an image of David's experiences abroad at an important time in his life. Principally, the film is one long flashback with brief darts back to the present also arriving as we witness Dave's exploits in tandem with that of his granddaughter's uncovering of the facts; her character most probably discovering as much about the Spanish Civil War as Loach's intended audience are. In 1930's Liverpool, Carr is in his mid twenties and intermingles with the odd friend here and there when he isn't looking for work out of being unemployed or maintaining his Communist party roots. One day, a trip to a local cinema encompasses that of a propagandist newsreel and a talk by a Spanish politician, of whom has come over to inform those of specific political stances whom might be willing to fight with him, as a brooding situation in Spain develops. Seemingly desiring a life away from what foundations he has, Carr accepts what proposals are outlined that day in the darkened, enclosed locale of the picture-house and it isn't long before he is riding a train in northern Spain to the front-line of what is The Spanish Civil war raging between Conservatives, and those of a more leftist-nature on the political spectrum, against the Fascist might of Franco and his followers. There is a beautifully placed scene very early on in Carr's venture out there, an exchange on board a train as he makes his way across and through the somewhat barren northern parts of the country depicting him barely able to even say the Spanish word for "Thank you". This, not only a happening highlighting his raw and inexperienced nature to the locale, actually accentuates how much it means to those with whom he's intermingling when a train guard hears of the cause for his presence and offers him a free ticket on behalf of it. One thing leads to another, and he eventually links up with a rag-tag bunch of soldiers predominantly populated by Spaniards known as the 'POUM', a united workers party fighting the concurrent fascist sentiment. Through this group of people of varying nationalities and the nature of their cross cultural banding togetherness, the general disposition of the film's production is nicely surmised, as this piece formulating out of the resultant coming together of varying fellows combining for a cause. It is within this group that he meets an array of people, including that of local Spaniards; Frenchmen; the fiery Maite (Bolla&iacute;n) as well as Blanca (Pator), whom he eventually comes to feel rather fondly for. The film does an excellent job in channelling the nature of what warfare in the trenches, unfolding in this era may have been like; everything droll and unglamourous when it isn't bullet ridden, the better equipped enemy never feeling much more than not-so-far-away, with conflict and violence seemingly around most turns. Away from the sequences of conflict, which reach heady heights when the early storming of a nearby town plays out, the film is rife with really remarkably played sequences of heavy political involvement featuring the characters deliberating and speaking on the state of their nation and what ought to happen; the scenes so authentic in their unfolding, one could be forgiven for thinking one had been transported back in time and invited to a live chaired debate. The film is a remarkable drama, a war film in which the warfare slips away and into the background whilst the characters take centre stage; a film which beautifully sews in a love story amidst all the strife and generally makes for accomplished viewing.

    There is much said about this film and so I only want to point out one thing. It is the Stalinist propaganda that tells the story that the anarchists and trotskyst slaughtered thousands of priests and burned down nearly all the churches in Spain and because of that the deeply religious people of Spain turned against socialism and so it was necessary for the Soviet Union to purge the International Brigades and the different groups who fought for the republic. It's brilliant how Loach turn this Stalinist propaganda into an argument against Stalin and for the trotskyst POUM by showing that the priest who is killed, is a brutal fascists and that all non-fascist inhabitants of that village agree with the execution of that priest. With that scene Loach is saying that those people who are against the actions against the church are in fact that ones who don't get along with the opinion of the so called "deeply religious people of Spain". There are many more definite parts of the film against Stalinism but since I had a loud and heavy argument with a Stalinist about the Spanish Civil War I specially like this one.

    Land and Freedom is a film of Ken Loach about the Spanish Civil war. It is certainly a war film, with lots of battle scenes, but nevertheless quite distinct from the stereotype battlefield spectacle. This is partly due to the director Loach, who has neither the urge nor the financial means to produce a large-scale report on battle-fields. However the main reason is the civil war itself, since the republic (the good guys) was defended by a peoples army, and not a professional one. In fact we witness the experiences of a militia, consisting of normal grown-up citizens, not the juvenile cannon fodder, that is crowding the average WW2 or Vietnam movie. When in Land and Freedom the militia attacks the trenches of the fascist troops, it is not a furious storm but a wearisome advancement, evidently by people whose physical conditions could have been better. The firing with their rifles seems unaimed and chaotic. At first I thought this was a display of bad acting, but in fact it is just the opposite. For the militia was composed of volunteers with little or no military training or background. Loach says in an interview, that the film is a critique on the stance of the republicans during the war. The resistance started as a collaboration between anarchist, Bolshevist and social-democrat groups, but soon the ideological differences started to cause growing frictions. Not surprisingly the Bolshevists were once again hoping to replicate the October revolution and seize power during the conflict. On the other hand the anarchists and syndicalists rejected any form of organization, and fully relied on the innate peoples will. Loach made this debate into the essential thread of the film. The story is like this: it is 1936. The British Communist Party recruits volunteers for international reserves of the republican army. David, who is a member of the BCP and out of work, travels to Spain and joins a militia of the POUM (apparently a Trotzkyist-anarchist fraction in the Spanish government). The militia consists of Spaniards (including two women), Frenchmen, Britons, an American, a German etc. They stay together for more than a year, and are remarkably spared the grief of casualties. At that time, and even during WWII, warfare did not yet have the professional intensity of the battlefields in Irak or Afghanistan. They are just killing time in their trenches. Even when a village is stormed, that is occupied by fascist troops, the enemy is already on the run. The number of fallen comrades in this action equals just one, and there is plenty of time for grief and a decent burial. Subsequently the militia joins the villagers in a debate about socialization of the agricultural land! Really, that are the syndicalists for you, they seem almost like Taliban. In the mean time, the government in Madrid realizes that this kind of defense will not win the war. (it could have ended in a long-lasting partisan guerrilla, but apparently in his later years Franco was able to mobilize sufficient social support). They try to put anarchist fractions like the POUM on a sidetrack, and eventually the anarchist militia are disarmed. Of course during this operation the Bolshevists resort to the well-known Stalinist methods of terror, including tortures. David has developed a (physical) liking for the anarchist Blanca, and tears apart his booklet of membership of the BCP (with stamps indicating your monthly payments, those good old days). Typical of the spirit in the militia is one of the final scenes, where they once more storm a fascist trench. Here the fighting gets tough, and the militia leader calls his superior by phone in order to complain about the uncomfortable conditions. Several militia members want a debate in order to consider a withdrawal. Later, when a superior officer actually orders the militia leader to withdraw, the leader wants to start a debate (in the middle of a fight, over the phone!) about the inconsistency of the orders! I find this scene particularly brilliant, reflecting the films subtlety and sarcasm. By the way, although modern warfare delegates much more responsibilities to the troops in the fields, obedience still remains a paramount requirement. Eventually Blanca is shot dead, and David returns home as a disillusioned man. What a mess! Nevertheless, the film confirms that the fascist troops are still the Hoesseins, and the republicans are still the Blairs. People interested in the Spanish Civil war should also see the documentary "The Spanish Earth" of director Joris Ivens and the excellent war film (if you fancy them) "F&uuml;nf Patronenh&uuml;lsen" of director Frank Beyer (which includes the heart-rending Busch song "Die Jarama Front"!).

The film originated an intense discussion in Spain about its principal theme , the Spanish Civil War . However the intense debate about ownership of lands proceeded in pseudo-documentary style is overlong and dull. Adequate cinematography by Barry Ackroyd , Ken Loach's usual . Perceptible and sensible musical score by George Fenton. &uml;Land and freedom &uml; was a Spanish- British co-production and obtained much success in the Spain box-office . The film belongs a splendid trilogy by Ken Loach, developing historical deeds from a thoughtful point of sight , such as &uml;Hidden agenda&uml; and &uml;The wind that shakes the barley&uml;. The motion picture is professionally directed by Ken Loach. In the 90s he directed a series of award-winning movies firmly establishing him as one of the best European filmmakers with &uml;Riff-Raff&uml;, &uml;Raining stones&uml; and &uml;My name is Joe&uml; winning several prizes in Cannes, and of course &uml;Land and freedom&uml; which achieved the Ecumenical Prize and the International critics Prize at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival. In the 2000s, Loach went on his special landmark about socialist realism with &uml;Bread and Roses&uml;, &uml;The Navigators&uml;, &uml;Sweet sixteen&uml;, &uml;Just a kiss&uml;, and &uml;It's free world&uml;. This rich human drama appeal to Ken Loach enthusiasts and history buffs.

    With the time that has elapsed since the Spanish Civil War and the time that has also elapsed since this film came out, 1995, this film has probably completely changed in meaning and what's more it must be extremely far away from what the non-Spanish citizens who participated in the Civil War might have thought at the time and might have remembered afterwards. The film shows essentially military amateurism and political strife on the front, since there was a real front with Franco and professional armed forces on the other side, as well as in Barcelona. Three trends are shown though not always clearly identified: the communists often called Stalinists, the anarchists identified as the CNT and the POUM who is some kind of Trotskyite organization both anti-communist and anti-anarchist and at the same time for total revolution as fast as possible, with the full collectivization of land, and a high level of independence, autonomy, even the refusal of hierarchy and authority. It led to a catastrophe of course with Franco helped by Mussolini and Hitler, and the communists only helped by other communist parties with the International Brigades and by Stalin provided the Stalinist model was followed. That clearly led to defeat. But an explanation is not given in the film. It is too short to just say discord prevailed. Why did it prevail? There we cannot give one answer only. There are several and even many. At first the weight of the international situation that made Spain a stake of the near future between all the western European countries, Italy and Germany included, and thus a divided West that let Hitler and Mussolini do what they wanted without any restraint, on one side, and on the other side the Communist International and the USSR who were trying to impose a clear model: collectivization of land and nationalization of industry, along with a strong state organization with a professional military force. No sense of compromise, no desire to reach any kind of compromise. Add to that the role of the church and the deep anti-clerical feelings of some sections of this Spanish left. Don't forget the sexist bigotry of a deeply catholic country and people: the equality of women could not last very long. That led to a civil war within the civil war and the defeat was guaranteed. But do not believe this film does not speak to us today, in the time of Obama in a globalized world in the midst of a financial crisis. The left is totally unable to find a complete unity on a realistic project and they have been systematically side-tracked in the recent or not so recent years in France or Italy or Greece. Spain is an exception, but probably not for long. The question that emerges from the film is: Was the social revolution advocated by these various revolutionary factions a realistic objective? Was it the real way History was going to take? I must admit the picture that comes out of this film makes me doubt it very much, especially twenty years after the fall of the last European communist experimentation. It feels as if that project was doomed to fail because of its unrealistic final objective, as well as the short term and middle term stages of that program. But there is a strong fragrance of absurdity in the depicted situation. They try to force history, accelerate it, in a way rape it, and history goes against that violation that can only work with a strong unity of the people behind that strong line and with a strong political and military power in the hands of the unified  or purified  leadership of the transformation, and yet for how long before a serious reform or final defeat? Sad but still true: those who try to violate history and its own pace, be they on the right or on the left, are totally blind to the fact that history does not follow a strict agenda and does not move along a straight line.

    This is a very powerful film, but it helps if the viewer has some background knowledge of the subject. The film is very serious and very political, and the Spanish Civil War was inextricably bound up with politics, both national and international. This is not an easy film to watch, because the subject is a painful one for the Loyalist supporter, as the original spirit of the working class people fighting fascism gives way to internal power struggles and hopeless division. As the young leftist hero writes to his girlfriend back in England, " The Fascists must be having a bloody good laugh at us". There is some welcome relief in the form of bawdy humor and tender romance, but the sense of tragedy forever linked to the war in Spain is unavoidable. The movie ends on a note of recognition of heroism and sacrifice that is quietly effective. Well worth seeing, for anyone interested in the history, or just a good drama of love and war.

    This film is structured basically the same way as Loach's most recent work, "The Wind that Shakes the Barley": a group of people manage to successfully win a battle against an enemy regime, and then starts to faction and dissolve slowly, eventually culminating in tragedy. "Land and Freedom", however, is a bit stronger and a lot smarter. It's obvious from these two movies that Loach is a leftist, but unlike most people who make political works for one side or the other, Loach has a strong understanding of the failings and weaknesses of his own politics. His movies often have moments of straightforward political debate, but he never lets any side seem less important than any other. He is one of those rare people who can analyze all of the issues from many directions, and underline the most important parts of what each side needs and what each side can't have. Loach also has a technique of making initial moments of militarism or violence seem rather childlike, like boys with toy guns running through hillsides and enjoying each other's company. These moments always precede direct damage to members of the group, and in "Land and Freedom", seeing the militia slowly fall apart is very disturbing. Loach also cleverly illustrates the difficulties of revolution from the perspective of the volunteers, as they start fighting for one cause and then find themselves on the opposite end of the barrel against their friends and neighbors. I've only recently begun watching the movies of Ken Loach, but I really admire the way he writes and directs his movies. He is definitely a very important filmmaker. --PolarisDiB
