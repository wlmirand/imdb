 <sinopse>
  A mob bagman finds that his luggage, containing the proof of his latest hit, has been switched.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  This is a very black comedy. A mob courier is hired to transport the heads of eight murder victims to a mob boss. However, the duffel bag gets mixed up with the bag of a college student who is off on a vacation in Mexico with his girlfriend and her parents. However, the mother is a recovering alcoholic whom everyone believes is delusional when she claims to have found heads.

    A mob bagman (Joe Pesci) finds that his luggage, containing the proof of his latest hit, has been switched. This was a nice departure for David Spade, stepping away from "Saturday Night Live", though still staying within comedy. Not his best work, but also probably not his fault. As a whole, the movie never really takes off the way it should. The exception is an awesome dream sequence, perhaps one of the better dream sequences ever filmed. Sadly, this one minute is the very best -- the rest of the film does not live up to the great title. Overall, it is quite tame on the violence and gore for the subject matter. If the same story was done without it being comedy, who knows how great this might have been?

    Before you begin calling me crazy (considering the fact that this movie got a low 11% on Rotten Tomatoes), I am going to say that I am a huge fan of Joe Pesci, and I have a sense of humor with a wide range. While this movie's title may sound like it isn't much, it is much. 8 Heads In A Duffel Bag is a great comedy, it is a very funny movie starring Joe Pesci. All throughout the course of this movie, there are laughs everywhere, I mean that when I was watching this movie, there where certain parts in which I was laughing myself silly. While it may not sound like there is anything funny about a mobster committing 8 murders and losing a duffel bag with their heads in them, but for some very weird reason, there was a lot of things in this movie that were so incredibly funny! Joe Pesci was great in this movie, he was funny, and a lot of times, hysterical! Well all in all, this is terrific entertainment, not for the entire family, considering that it is R rated, but still, it is very terrific entertainment! This movie gets a ten out of ten from me. Joe Pesci is very funny in this movie, here, he plays another one of his psychopathic mobsters, but only this time, he does it in a comedy role, and I like that once in a while, he does a role like his roles from Goodfellas and Casino, but this time around, he does it in a comedy movie. It just goes to show truly what a talented actor Joe Pesci really is, he can play a serious role, or a comedy role, and he can shine in it. He shined in Goodfellas, and he shined Casino, and he shined in 8 Heads In A Duffel Bag! How this movie got a low 11% on Rotten Tomatoes is beyond me, maybe because the critics were expecting a movie like Casino or Goodfellas. Come on, this movie is not supposed to be one of the greatest movies ever made, it is supposed to do what a movie should do, entertain people, and it certainly entertained me! I won't let bad reviews affect my judgement, I believe that this movie is a very funny movie! Watch this movie was a clear mind, ignore all of the negativity that you have heard and watch this movie yourself, you will laugh your head off at it. What can I say? Sometimes, there are times in which you can't rely on critics, because you can never really tell how good or bad a movie is until you see it for yourself. I am standing by my own opinion, this movie is very funny, it is a hysterical movie that delivers the laughs, as well as the chaos! Get ready to see Joe Pesci in a very hysterical role that will leave you laughing! My applauds to Joe Pesci, who once again has been able to amuse me with his excellent acting abilities! 8 Heads In A Duffel Bag is a hysterical comedy that you will laugh your head off at! Well watch this movie with a clear mind, because if you do that, you can give an honest opinion on it. This movie is mostly funny because it is so outrageous, when you watch it, you will see what I mean. 10/10

    The film begins auspiciously enough; Tommy (Joe Pesci) a middleman for two assassins is hired to transport eight severed heads to their mob boss to prove their owners are dead. This would be his last job before his retirement so to play it safe, he packs them in a duffel bag and takes a plane instead of driving because, you know, airport security was less stringent in 1997. While on board the plane, Tommy meets Charlie (Andy Comeau) a college student set to meet his girlfriend (Kristy Swanson) and her parents (George Hamilton & Dyan Cannon) in Mexico. Naturally Charlie's duffel bag get switched and madness ensues. If you're interest was peaked by that small synopsis you're in for a mixed bag. The story unfolds somewhat predictably though definitely not without energy. Joe Pesci who has been able to hone-in on his inner Guido since Goodfellas, barks, snaps and growls to the point where every scene he's in is utter magic. Even with a situation as clich&eacute; as being on the phone while an impatient extra circles behind you is done with panache. His costars however play their parts with less success. Andy Comeau has the appearance of your typical rube but he doesn't have the the attention to detail more experienced actors have. Playing it safe he seems frazzled when he should be panicked. David Spade and Todd Louiso who play Charlie's college friends and are shoehorned into the series of unfortunate events fare better but get a little annoying towards the end. Aside from Pesci, the only person who really hits a home run is Ernestine Mercer who plays Swanson's no-nonsense grandmother. "8 Heads" however, is a fun time waster and manages to keep things light despite its dark subject matter. Writer/Director Tom Schulman who also wrote "What About Bob?" and "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids" manages to keep the pace of your average farce without reinventing the wheel. And yes, there are head puns in this film but the groaner aren't the only thing this film has going for it.

    You won't laugh your head off at "8 Heads in a Duffel Bag" because this decapitated comedy of errors is about as funny as a frontal lobotomy. Pint-sized Joe Pesci of "Goodfellas" plays Tommy, a combustible, crew-cut, wise-guy who must deliver a duffel bag of eight heads to a vengeful crime boss. Basically, the mob chieftain insists on verifying the contents for himself. Andy Comeau co-stars as a clean-cut college kid named Charlie, with a duffel bag of duds, bound for a weekend in Mexico with his cute girlfriend Laurie Bennett (Kristy Swanson of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer") and her stuffy parents. Dyan Cannon and George Hamilton play Laurie's mother and father Annette and Dick Bennett. Tommy and Charlie take the same flight out, sit next to each other, but don't hit it off. Guess whose bags do the duffel shuffle in all the airport chaos. When Tommy learns he has snagged the wrong bag, he heads off for Charlie's college fraternity house. He tortures Charlie's two pin-headed med school pals Ernie (David Spade) and Steve (Todd Louiso) who cannot tell Tommy a thing because they know nothing about Charlie's plans. How much laughter can you generate from of a scene where a thug snaps a wet towel at two naked frat boys? Meanwhile, in Mexico, David's future mother-in-law, Annette Bennett (Dyan Cannon of "Bob, Carol, Ted, and Alice") discovers the grisly contents of the bag and turn into a basket case. Charlie and his girlfriend try to lose the heads, but nothing they do works. Thieves steal Dick Bennett's truck fro them, and a coyote snatches one of the noggins. Dick winds up in a Mexican hoosegow after two heads show up in his baggage at the airport. Eventually, just as Tommy is about to snuff the frats, Charlie calls. Charlie and Tommy agree to get their heads together. By this time, writer & director Tom Schulman has devoted half of the movie to time spent in Mexico on the labored comedy of characters up to their ears in head games. The lowbrow plot gets even more complicated and less humorous. Tommy finds out that Charlie might have let a couple of heads roll, so he forces Ernie and Steve to help him come up with two replacement craniums. While all of this is happening, two more mob guys trail Tommy across the border. It seems that the headstrong crime boss is pretty head up waiting for his heads. Bennett's mother, a chain-smoking battle ax, shows up, too. The trouble with "8 Heads" is that Schulman spends too much time bringing Tommy and Charlie together. A good comedy of errors depends on nimble timing, witty humor, and a snappy story. "8 Heads" squanders too much time on plot filler and gets a little too mean-spirited, particularly when Tommy spews profanities galore. The confusion that guillotines the best laid plans of the heroes rarely elicits a laugh. Tommy looks like a headbanger who wandered in from a Martin Scorsese bloodbath. You know you're in trouble at a comedy when the movie allots more time to the exposition than the gags. You know you're watching an empty-heded comedy when the movie characters resort to jokes about the film. You know the movie-makers are desperate when the resort to a dream sequence. They have the heads warble a tune in Tommy's dreams, while their headless bodies attack him. Pretty soon you notice, too, that the laughs get to be fewer and far between. When one of the characters suggests a better plan than what the writer gave to the star, you know you're in a bad movie. Charlie criticizes Tommy for not flying the heads out on a privately chartered jet. Sure, the heads would arrive intact, but there would be no comedy. Anyway, it shows what a numbskull Tommy is. You'd at least mark your bag if you were toting around severed body parts, right? Compared with the wise guys that he impersonated in "Goodfellas" and "Casino," Pesci's errand boy Tommy is just plain cranky. He loves to smash phones and brandish his giant automatic pistol. Tommy makes a terrible hero because he's never sympathetic and he is much too stupid. Indeed, it is fun to see a couple of 1960s era stars like Cannon and Hamilton co-star in a 1990s film, but they're wasted in stereotypical supporting roles. Hamilton phones in most of his lines to his mother, trying to persuade her not to visit their motel. Spade sleepwalks through a role that demands very little of his enormously dry talent. "8 Heads in a Duffel Bag" belongs to the corpse comedy genre. Even "Weekend at Bernie's 2" was one head and one body about this multi-cranical farce. Pesci fans will wonder why he gave his nod to this skullduggery.

    Eventually, one of the bigger flaws of "8 Heads In A Duffel Bag" will strike viewers. They will ask themselves, "Why does the tone of the movie keep changing?" Sometimes the movie is a goofy comedy. Sometimes it's high-energy farce. Sometimes (actually, most of the time), the movie's tone is kind of flat. I'm not sure why the tone kept changing. Maybe it was a consequence of the lower budget - although the movie never looks seriously cheap, it has the appearance of being hastily shot with not much thought put through it. (And while most of the movie is set in Mexico, it's pretty obvious that it was not shot there.) However, even if a more consistent tone had been generated, the movie would still suffer from a screenplay with a number of flaws. Although Pesci's character has a deadline, he obviously goes past this deadline with no consequences. The movie keeps dropping plot elements and bringing them back after a long time has passed. There are plot holes, and the last third of the movie, when all the characters are together, becomes somewhat confusing. I will admit that I did laugh a few times, mostly at Pesci's behavior and one-liners. And it's nice to see George Hamilton in a major studio movie again, though he is mostly wasted. But while the movie's flaws didn't aggravate me greatly, at the end I muttered "ehhhh" to the 95 minutes I had just watched.

    This is one of those movies that time has forgotten, it wasn't a huge success and not a lot of people even know it exists. Too bad that often happens to good films. This film is about you guessed it...Eight heads in a duffel bag. They are supposed to be delivered to a gangster, but end up in the wrong hands and the laughs follow them on their journey. Joe Pesci and Dyan Cannon made me laugh the most here and the rest of the cast were fine too, even if David Spade is in it and is annoying. Pesci has his normal gangster attitude in this movie and thats the Pesci we love, there is no one like him in the biz and he's just one in a million. This movie is worth a watch to anyone that likes their comedies wacky and love to see people getting in weird predicaments. Give it a chance people it will make you smile.

    Perhaps inspired by the Warren Oates classic "Bring Me the Head of Alffredo Garcia", this heads in a bag comedy has a strong opening, and a somewhat ridiculous finish. The actor's do quite well with what is essentially a one joke movie. "8 Heads in a Duffel Bag" starts as black comedy, but eventually morphs into nothing more than slapstick. The ending at the airport is especially weak, as any idea of how to conclude the film seems to have been lost. Nevertheless, the strong, "dark" first half, along with above average comedy material saves the movie, and compared to some of today's lame comedies, I can recommend seeing "8 Heads in a Duffel Bag." - MERK

    The plot is easy to follow. The actors carried it off well and kept the entertainment comical and light. A group of us at work actually watched this on a lunch hour and every one of us appreciated the break. We all felt that the plot was well written, the actors carried the film nicely and that we couldn't have picked a better movie to take a break with. We needed a break from job stress and this movie provided the perfect medicine. We went back to our stressful jobs feeling a lot lighter. I also rented it again for my grandkids who are in their teens. They loved the movie enough to go out and purchase it. I would recommend it to those of you that have a sense of humor and can appreciate comedy. Thanks for the laughs:)

    The 1930s got many misunderstanding comedies, and the 1960s got (It's Mad Mad Mad World) where a lot of people were chasing a suitcase. Although this movie reminded me of both, but in here it's one hell of an original one where the rhythm is highly hot, the backgrounds are nice, the atmosphere is like everything : masterfully light. (Joe Pesci) is on the top of his game, how he looked so charismatic more than ever, and of course his comic performance is flawless. All the rest presented their best despite that they all weren't as good as the lead. Maybe the music wasn't creative inasmuch as traditional which mostly done nothing but overstating the performance, the ending was that unconvincingly fast, and of course the matter of being disgusting.. However it's the late 1990s ! So after a cinematic history of hunting a duffel with important papers, diamonds, money, or anything polite.. It's about time to chase heads (god knows what could be chased after, but I can wonder !). (Robert De Niro) is being spoofed in here at the scene of (Are You Talking to Me ?), and nothing is odd since (Pesci) spoofed himself in here also where he was smashing any payphone like his character in (JFK  1992). The only thing to complain about that when (Joe Pesci) is talking about "retirement" afterwards from being a gangster he really did it yet as an actor in real life ! As he didn't make something during the next 11 years except (Gone Fishin' - 1997), (Lethal Weapon 4 - 1998), and a guest appearance in one very short scene at (The Good Shepherd - 2006) directed by (De Niro). The smartest of it all : (Pesci) throws the nasty blabber mother-in-law out of the van over the mountain, it's classical as it seemed like everyman's dream of any unstoppable nagger comes insanely true !, seeing (George Hamilton) without his famous hair at the closing credits, another dream comes true. The musical nightmare of the heads singing a sick version of Mr. Sandman, that summarizes the whole beauty of it. True that in movies' stories nothing is totally original though here the plot definitely was, along with the wonderful condition that this movie leaves you with.

    I have to start by asking, What kind of a premise is that!? A man who is about to married gets stuck with a duffel bags with specifically eight heads. How did he get the heads? His duffel bag got switched with a hit man's duffel bag on an airplane! Um. Out of all the interesting film premises out there, why on earth does this film have to have that as the premise? So right off, I hated the story. The rest of the film isn't bad. It isn't a particularly funny film, although David Spade and Joe Pesci are really funny in this. I suppose I can recommend it. I just would have preferred that the film didn't have such a weird story. David Spade and Joe Pesci are excellent and it's a different kind of film. That's about all I can say.

You know you're watching an empty-heded comedy when the movie characters resort to jokes about the film. You know the movie-makers are desperate when the resort to a dream sequence. They have the heads warble a tune in Tommy's dreams, while their headless bodies attack him. Pretty soon you notice, too, that the laughs get to be fewer and far between. When one of the characters suggests a better plan than what the writer gave to the star, you know you're in a bad movie. Charlie criticizes Tommy for not flying the heads out on a privately chartered jet. Sure, the heads would arrive intact, but there would be no comedy. Anyway, it shows what a numbskull Tommy is. You'd at least mark your bag if you were toting around severed body parts, right? Compared with the wise guys that he impersonated in "Goodfellas" and "Casino," Pesci's errand boy Tommy is just plain cranky. He loves to smash phones and brandish his giant automatic pistol. Tommy makes a terrible hero because he's never sympathetic and he is much too stupid. Indeed, it is fun to see a couple of 1960s era stars like Cannon and Hamilton co-star in a 1990s film, but they're wasted in stereotypical supporting roles. Hamilton phones in most of his lines to his mother, trying to persuade her not to visit their motel. Spade sleepwalks through a role that demands very little of his enormously dry talent. "8 Heads in a Duffel Bag" belongs to the corpse comedy genre. Even "Weekend at Bernie's 2" was one head and one body about this multi-cranical farce. Pesci fans will wonder why he gave his nod to this skullduggery.

    Eventually, one of the bigger flaws of "8 Heads In A Duffel Bag" will strike viewers. They will ask themselves, "Why does the tone of the movie keep changing?" Sometimes the movie is a goofy comedy. Sometimes it's high-energy farce. Sometimes (actually, most of the time), the movie's tone is kind of flat. I'm not sure why the tone kept changing. Maybe it was a consequence of the lower budget - although the movie never looks seriously cheap, it has the appearance of being hastily shot with not much thought put through it. (And while most of the movie is set in Mexico, it's pretty obvious that it was not shot there.) However, even if a more consistent tone had been generated, the movie would still suffer from a screenplay with a number of flaws. Although Pesci's character has a deadline, he obviously goes past this deadline with no consequences. The movie keeps dropping plot elements and bringing them back after a long time has passed. There are plot holes, and the last third of the movie, when all the characters are together, becomes somewhat confusing. I will admit that I did laugh a few times, mostly at Pesci's behavior and one-liners. And it's nice to see George Hamilton in a major studio movie again, though he is mostly wasted. But while the movie's flaws didn't aggravate me greatly, at the end I muttered "ehhhh" to the 95 minutes I had just watched.

    This is one of those movies that time has forgotten, it wasn't a huge success and not a lot of people even know it exists. Too bad that often happens to good films. This film is about you guessed it...Eight heads in a duffel bag. They are supposed to be delivered to a gangster, but end up in the wrong hands and the laughs follow them on their journey. Joe Pesci and Dyan Cannon made me laugh the most here and the rest of the cast were fine too, even if David Spade is in it and is annoying. Pesci has his normal gangster attitude in this movie and thats the Pesci we love, there is no one like him in the biz and he's just one in a million. This movie is worth a watch to anyone that likes their comedies wacky and love to see people getting in weird predicaments. Give it a chance people it will make you smile.

    Perhaps inspired by the Warren Oates classic "Bring Me the Head of Alffredo Garcia", this heads in a bag comedy has a strong opening, and a somewhat ridiculous finish. The actor's do quite well with what is essentially a one joke movie. "8 Heads in a Duffel Bag" starts as black comedy, but eventually morphs into nothing more than slapstick. The ending at the airport is especially weak, as any idea of how to conclude the film seems to have been lost. Nevertheless, the strong, "dark" first half, along with above average comedy material saves the movie, and compared to some of today's lame comedies, I can recommend seeing "8 Heads in a Duffel Bag." - MERK

    The plot is easy to follow. The actors carried it off well and kept the entertainment comical and light. A group of us at work actually watched this on a lunch hour and every one of us appreciated the break. We all felt that the plot was well written, the actors carried the film nicely and that we couldn't have picked a better movie to take a break with. We needed a break from job stress and this movie provided the perfect medicine. We went back to our stressful jobs feeling a lot lighter. I also rented it again for my grandkids who are in their teens. They loved the movie enough to go out and purchase it. I would recommend it to those of you that have a sense of humor and can appreciate comedy. Thanks for the laughs:)

    The 1930s got many misunderstanding comedies, and the 1960s got (It's Mad Mad Mad World) where a lot of people were chasing a suitcase. Although this movie reminded me of both, but in here it's one hell of an original one where the rhythm is highly hot, the backgrounds are nice, the atmosphere is like everything : masterfully light. (Joe Pesci) is on the top of his game, how he looked so charismatic more than ever, and of course his comic performance is flawless. All the rest presented their best despite that they all weren't as good as the lead. Maybe the music wasn't creative inasmuch as traditional which mostly done nothing but overstating the performance, the ending was that unconvincingly fast, and of course the matter of being disgusting.. However it's the late 1990s ! So after a cinematic history of hunting a duffel with important papers, diamonds, money, or anything polite.. It's about time to chase heads (god knows what could be chased after, but I can wonder !). (Robert De Niro) is being spoofed in here at the scene of (Are You Talking to Me ?), and nothing is odd since (Pesci) spoofed himself in here also where he was smashing any payphone like his character in (JFK  1992). The only thing to complain about that when (Joe Pesci) is talking about "retirement" afterwards from being a gangster he really did it yet as an actor in real life ! As he didn't make something during the next 11 years except (Gone Fishin' - 1997), (Lethal Weapon 4 - 1998), and a guest appearance in one very short scene at (The Good Shepherd - 2006) directed by (De Niro). The smartest of it all : (Pesci) throws the nasty blabber mother-in-law out of the van over the mountain, it's classical as it seemed like everyman's dream of any unstoppable nagger comes insanely true !, seeing (George Hamilton) without his famous hair at the closing credits, another dream comes true. The musical nightmare of the heads singing a sick version of Mr. Sandman, that summarizes the whole beauty of it. True that in movies' stories nothing is totally original though here the plot definitely was, along with the wonderful condition that this movie leaves you with.

    I have to start by asking, What kind of a premise is that!? A man who is about to married gets stuck with a duffel bags with specifically eight heads. How did he get the heads? His duffel bag got switched with a hit man's duffel bag on an airplane! Um. Out of all the interesting film premises out there, why on earth does this film have to have that as the premise? So right off, I hated the story. The rest of the film isn't bad. It isn't a particularly funny film, although David Spade and Joe Pesci are really funny in this. I suppose I can recommend it. I just would have preferred that the film didn't have such a weird story. David Spade and Joe Pesci are excellent and it's a different kind of film. That's about all I can say.

    A mob bagman (Joe Pesci) finds that his luggage, containing the proof of his latest hit, has been switched. This was a nice departure for David Spade, stepping away from "Saturday Night Live", though still staying within comedy. Not his best work, but also probably not his fault. As a whole, the movie never really takes off the way it should. The exception is an awesome dream sequence, perhaps one of the better dream sequences ever filmed. Sadly, this one minute is the very best -- the rest of the film does not live up to the great title. Overall, it is quite tame on the violence and gore for the subject matter. If the same story was done without it being comedy, who knows how great this might have been?

    Before you begin calling me crazy (considering the fact that this movie got a low 11% on Rotten Tomatoes), I am going to say that I am a huge fan of Joe Pesci, and I have a sense of humor with a wide range. While this movie's title may sound like it isn't much, it is much. 8 Heads In A Duffel Bag is a great comedy, it is a very funny movie starring Joe Pesci. All throughout the course of this movie, there are laughs everywhere, I mean that when I was watching this movie, there where certain parts in which I was laughing myself silly. While it may not sound like there is anything funny about a mobster committing 8 murders and losing a duffel bag with their heads in them, but for some very weird reason, there was a lot of things in this movie that were so incredibly funny! Joe Pesci was great in this movie, he was funny, and a lot of times, hysterical! Well all in all, this is terrific entertainment, not for the entire family, considering that it is R rated, but still, it is very terrific entertainment! This movie gets a ten out of ten from me. Joe Pesci is very funny in this movie, here, he plays another one of his psychopathic mobsters, but only this time, he does it in a comedy role, and I like that once in a while, he does a role like his roles from Goodfellas and Casino, but this time around, he does it in a comedy movie. It just goes to show truly what a talented actor Joe Pesci really is, he can play a serious role, or a comedy role, and he can shine in it. He shined in Goodfellas, and he shined Casino, and he shined in 8 Heads In A Duffel Bag! How this movie got a low 11% on Rotten Tomatoes is beyond me, maybe because the critics were expecting a movie like Casino or Goodfellas. Come on, this movie is not supposed to be one of the greatest movies ever made, it is supposed to do what a movie should do, entertain people, and it certainly entertained me! I won't let bad reviews affect my judgement, I believe that this movie is a very funny movie! Watch this movie was a clear mind, ignore all of the negativity that you have heard and watch this movie yourself, you will laugh your head off at it. What can I say? Sometimes, there are times in which you can't rely on critics, because you can never really tell how good or bad a movie is until you see it for yourself. I am standing by my own opinion, this movie is very funny, it is a hysterical movie that delivers the laughs, as well as the chaos! Get ready to see Joe Pesci in a very hysterical role that will leave you laughing! My applauds to Joe Pesci, who once again has been able to amuse me with his excellent acting abilities! 8 Heads In A Duffel Bag is a hysterical comedy that you will laugh your head off at! Well watch this movie with a clear mind, because if you do that, you can give an honest opinion on it. This movie is mostly funny because it is so outrageous, when you watch it, you will see what I mean. 10/10

    The film begins auspiciously enough; Tommy (Joe Pesci) a middleman for two assassins is hired to transport eight severed heads to their mob boss to prove their owners are dead. This would be his last job before his retirement so to play it safe, he packs them in a duffel bag and takes a plane instead of driving because, you know, airport security was less stringent in 1997. While on board the plane, Tommy meets Charlie (Andy Comeau) a college student set to meet his girlfriend (Kristy Swanson) and her parents (George Hamilton & Dyan Cannon) in Mexico. Naturally Charlie's duffel bag get switched and madness ensues. If you're interest was peaked by that small synopsis you're in for a mixed bag. The story unfolds somewhat predictably though definitely not without energy. Joe Pesci who has been able to hone-in on his inner Guido since Goodfellas, barks, snaps and growls to the point where every scene he's in is utter magic. Even with a situation as clich&eacute; as being on the phone while an impatient extra circles behind you is done with panache. His costars however play their parts with less success. Andy Comeau has the appearance of your typical rube but he doesn't have the the attention to detail more experienced actors have. Playing it safe he seems frazzled when he should be panicked. David Spade and Todd Louiso who play Charlie's college friends and are shoehorned into the series of unfortunate events fare better but get a little annoying towards the end. Aside from Pesci, the only person who really hits a home run is Ernestine Mercer who plays Swanson's no-nonsense grandmother. "8 Heads" however, is a fun time waster and manages to keep things light despite its dark subject matter. Writer/Director Tom Schulman who also wrote "What About Bob?" and "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids" manages to keep the pace of your average farce without reinventing the wheel. And yes, there are head puns in this film but the groaner aren't the only thing this film has going for it.

    You won't laugh your head off at "8 Heads in a Duffel Bag" because this decapitated comedy of errors is about as funny as a frontal lobotomy. Pint-sized Joe Pesci of "Goodfellas" plays Tommy, a combustible, crew-cut, wise-guy who must deliver a duffel bag of eight heads to a vengeful crime boss. Basically, the mob chieftain insists on verifying the contents for himself. Andy Comeau co-stars as a clean-cut college kid named Charlie, with a duffel bag of duds, bound for a weekend in Mexico with his cute girlfriend Laurie Bennett (Kristy Swanson of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer") and her stuffy parents. Dyan Cannon and George Hamilton play Laurie's mother and father Annette and Dick Bennett. Tommy and Charlie take the same flight out, sit next to each other, but don't hit it off. Guess whose bags do the duffel shuffle in all the airport chaos. When Tommy learns he has snagged the wrong bag, he heads off for Charlie's college fraternity house. He tortures Charlie's two pin-headed med school pals Ernie (David Spade) and Steve (Todd Louiso) who cannot tell Tommy a thing because they know nothing about Charlie's plans. How much laughter can you generate from of a scene where a thug snaps a wet towel at two naked frat boys? Meanwhile, in Mexico, David's future mother-in-law, Annette Bennett (Dyan Cannon of "Bob, Carol, Ted, and Alice") discovers the grisly contents of the bag and turn into a basket case. Charlie and his girlfriend try to lose the heads, but nothing they do works. Thieves steal Dick Bennett's truck fro them, and a coyote snatches one of the noggins. Dick winds up in a Mexican hoosegow after two heads show up in his baggage at the airport. Eventually, just as Tommy is about to snuff the frats, Charlie calls. Charlie and Tommy agree to get their heads together. By this time, writer & director Tom Schulman has devoted half of the movie to time spent in Mexico on the labored comedy of characters up to their ears in head games. The lowbrow plot gets even more complicated and less humorous. Tommy finds out that Charlie might have let a couple of heads roll, so he forces Ernie and Steve to help him come up with two replacement craniums. While all of this is happening, two more mob guys trail Tommy across the border. It seems that the headstrong crime boss is pretty head up waiting for his heads. Bennett's mother, a chain-smoking battle ax, shows up, too. The trouble with "8 Heads" is that Schulman spends too much time bringing Tommy and Charlie together. A good comedy of errors depends on nimble timing, witty humor, and a snappy story. "8 Heads" squanders too much time on plot filler and gets a little too mean-spirited, particularly when Tommy spews profanities galore. The confusion that guillotines the best laid plans of the heroes rarely elicits a laugh. Tommy looks like a headbanger who wandered in from a Martin Scorsese bloodbath. You know you're in trouble at a comedy when the movie allots more time to the exposition than the gags. You know you're watching an empty-heded comedy when the movie characters resort to jokes about the film. You know the movie-makers are desperate when the resort to a dream sequence. They have the heads warble a tune in Tommy's dreams, while their headless bodies attack him. Pretty soon you notice, too, that the laughs get to be fewer and far between. When one of the characters suggests a better plan than what the writer gave to the star, you know you're in a bad movie. Charlie criticizes Tommy for not flying the heads out on a privately chartered jet. Sure, the heads would arrive intact, but there would be no comedy. Anyway, it shows what a numbskull Tommy is. You'd at least mark your bag if you were toting around severed body parts, right? Compared with the wise guys that he impersonated in "Goodfellas" and "Casino," Pesci's errand boy Tommy is just plain cranky. He loves to smash phones and brandish his giant automatic pistol.

    Before you begin calling me crazy (considering the fact that this movie got a low 11% on Rotten Tomatoes), I am going to say that I am a huge fan of Joe Pesci, and I have a sense of humor with a wide range. While this movie's title may sound like it isn't much, it is much. 8 Heads In A Duffel Bag is a great comedy, it is a very funny movie starring Joe Pesci. All throughout the course of this movie, there are laughs everywhere, I mean that when I was watching this movie, there where certain parts in which I was laughing myself silly. While it may not sound like there is anything funny about a mobster committing 8 murders and losing a duffel bag with their heads in them, but for some very weird reason, there was a lot of things in this movie that were so incredibly funny! Joe Pesci was great in this movie, he was funny, and a lot of times, hysterical! Well all in all, this is terrific entertainment, not for the entire family, considering that it is R rated, but still, it is very terrific entertainment! This movie gets a ten out of ten from me. Joe Pesci is very funny in this movie, here, he plays another one of his psychopathic mobsters, but only this time, he does it in a comedy role, and I like that once in a while, he does a role like his roles from Goodfellas and Casino, but this time around, he does it in a comedy movie. It just goes to show truly what a talented actor Joe Pesci really is, he can play a serious role, or a comedy role, and he can shine in it. He shined in Goodfellas, and he shined Casino, and he shined in 8 Heads In A Duffel Bag! How this movie got a low 11% on Rotten Tomatoes is beyond me, maybe because the critics were expecting a movie like Casino or Goodfellas. Come on, this movie is not supposed to be one of the greatest movies ever made, it is supposed to do what a movie should do, entertain people, and it certainly entertained me! I won't let bad reviews affect my judgement, I believe that this movie is a very funny movie! Watch this movie was a clear mind, ignore all of the negativity that you have heard and watch this movie yourself, you will laugh your head off at it. What can I say? Sometimes, there are times in which you can't rely on critics, because you can never really tell how good or bad a movie is until you see it for yourself. I am standing by my own opinion, this movie is very funny, it is a hysterical movie that delivers the laughs, as well as the chaos! Get ready to see Joe Pesci in a very hysterical role that will leave you laughing! My applauds to Joe Pesci, who once again has been able to amuse me with his excellent acting abilities! 8 Heads In A Duffel Bag is a hysterical comedy that you will laugh your head off at! Well watch this movie with a clear mind, because if you do that, you can give an honest opinion on it. This movie is mostly funny because it is so outrageous, when you watch it, you will see what I mean. 10/10

    The film begins auspiciously enough; Tommy (Joe Pesci) a middleman for two assassins is hired to transport eight severed heads to their mob boss to prove their owners are dead. This would be his last job before his retirement so to play it safe, he packs them in a duffel bag and takes a plane instead of driving because, you know, airport security was less stringent in 1997. While on board the plane, Tommy meets Charlie (Andy Comeau) a college student set to meet his girlfriend (Kristy Swanson) and her parents (George Hamilton & Dyan Cannon) in Mexico. Naturally Charlie's duffel bag get switched and madness ensues. If you're interest was peaked by that small synopsis you're in for a mixed bag. The story unfolds somewhat predictably though definitely not without energy. Joe Pesci who has been able to hone-in on his inner Guido since Goodfellas, barks, snaps and growls to the point where every scene he's in is utter magic. Even with a situation as clich&eacute; as being on the phone while an impatient extra circles behind you is done with panache. His costars however play their parts with less success. Andy Comeau has the appearance of your typical rube but he doesn't have the the attention to detail more experienced actors have. Playing it safe he seems frazzled when he should be panicked. David Spade and Todd Louiso who play Charlie's college friends and are shoehorned into the series of unfortunate events fare better but get a little annoying towards the end. Aside from Pesci, the only person who really hits a home run is Ernestine Mercer who plays Swanson's no-nonsense grandmother. "8 Heads" however, is a fun time waster and manages to keep things light despite its dark subject matter. Writer/Director Tom Schulman who also wrote "What About Bob?" and "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids" manages to keep the pace of your average farce without reinventing the wheel. And yes, there are head puns in this film but the groaner aren't the only thing this film has going for it.

    You won't laugh your head off at "8 Heads in a Duffel Bag" because this decapitated comedy of errors is about as funny as a frontal lobotomy. Pint-sized Joe Pesci of "Goodfellas" plays Tommy, a combustible, crew-cut, wise-guy who must deliver a duffel bag of eight heads to a vengeful crime boss. Basically, the mob chieftain insists on verifying the contents for himself. Andy Comeau co-stars as a clean-cut college kid named Charlie, with a duffel bag of duds, bound for a weekend in Mexico with his cute girlfriend Laurie Bennett (Kristy Swanson of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer") and her stuffy parents. Dyan Cannon and George Hamilton play Laurie's mother and father Annette and Dick Bennett. Tommy and Charlie take the same flight out, sit next to each other, but don't hit it off. Guess whose bags do the duffel shuffle in all the airport chaos. When Tommy learns he has snagged the wrong bag, he heads off for Charlie's college fraternity house. He tortures Charlie's two pin-headed med school pals Ernie (David Spade) and Steve (Todd Louiso) who cannot tell Tommy a thing because they know nothing about Charlie's plans. How much laughter can you generate from of a scene where a thug snaps a wet towel at two naked frat boys? Meanwhile, in Mexico, David's future mother-in-law, Annette Bennett (Dyan Cannon of "Bob, Carol, Ted, and Alice") discovers the grisly contents of the bag and turn into a basket case. Charlie and his girlfriend try to lose the heads, but nothing they do works. Thieves steal Dick Bennett's truck fro them, and a coyote snatches one of the noggins. Dick winds up in a Mexican hoosegow after two heads show up in his baggage at the airport. Eventually, just as Tommy is about to snuff the frats, Charlie calls. Charlie and Tommy agree to get their heads together. By this time, writer & director Tom Schulman has devoted half of the movie to time spent in Mexico on the labored comedy of characters up to their ears in head games. The lowbrow plot gets even more complicated and less humorous. Tommy finds out that Charlie might have let a couple of heads roll, so he forces Ernie and Steve to help him come up with two replacement craniums. While all of this is happening, two more mob guys trail Tommy across the border. It seems that the headstrong crime boss is pretty head up waiting for his heads. Bennett's mother, a chain-smoking battle ax, shows up, too. The trouble with "8 Heads" is that Schulman spends too much time bringing Tommy and Charlie together. A good comedy of errors depends on nimble timing, witty humor, and a snappy story. "8 Heads" squanders too much time on plot filler and gets a little too mean-spirited, particularly when Tommy spews profanities galore. The confusion that guillotines the best laid plans of the heroes rarely elicits a laugh. Tommy looks like a headbanger who wandered in from a Martin Scorsese bloodbath. You know you're in trouble at a comedy when the movie allots more time to the exposition than the gags. You know you're watching an empty-heded comedy when the movie characters resort to jokes about the film. You know the movie-makers are desperate when the resort to a dream sequence. They have the heads warble a tune in Tommy's dreams, while their headless bodies attack him. Pretty soon you notice, too, that the laughs get to be fewer and far between. When one of the characters suggests a better plan than what the writer gave to the star, you know you're in a bad movie. Charlie criticizes Tommy for not flying the heads out on a privately chartered jet. Sure, the heads would arrive intact, but there would be no comedy. Anyway, it shows what a numbskull Tommy is. You'd at least mark your bag if you were toting around severed body parts, right? Compared with the wise guys that he impersonated in "Goodfellas" and "Casino," Pesci's errand boy Tommy is just plain cranky. He loves to smash phones and brandish his giant automatic pistol. Tommy makes a terrible hero because he's never sympathetic and he is much too stupid. Indeed, it is fun to see a couple of 1960s era stars like Cannon and Hamilton co-star in a 1990s film, but they're wasted in stereotypical supporting roles. Hamilton phones in most of his lines to his mother, trying to persuade her not to visit their motel. Spade sleepwalks through a role that demands very little of his enormously dry talent. "8 Heads in a Duffel Bag" belongs to the corpse comedy genre. Even "Weekend at Bernie's 2" was one head and one body about this multi-cranical farce. Pesci fans will wonder why he gave his nod to this skullduggery.

    Eventually, one of the bigger flaws of "8 Heads In A Duffel Bag" will strike viewers. They will ask themselves, "Why does the tone of the movie keep changing?" Sometimes the movie is a goofy comedy. Sometimes it's high-energy farce. Sometimes (actually, most of the time), the movie's tone is kind of flat. I'm not sure why the tone kept changing. Maybe it was a consequence of the lower budget - although the movie never looks seriously cheap, it has the appearance of being hastily shot with not much thought put through it. (And while most of the movie is set in Mexico, it's pretty obvious that it was not shot there.) However, even if a more consistent tone had been generated, the movie would still suffer from a screenplay with a number of flaws. Although Pesci's character has a deadline, he obviously goes past this deadline with no consequences. The movie keeps dropping plot elements and bringing them back after a long time has passed. There are plot holes, and the last third of the movie, when all the characters are together, becomes somewhat confusing. I will admit that I did laugh a few times, mostly at Pesci's behavior and one-liners. And it's nice to see George Hamilton in a major studio movie again, though he is mostly wasted. But while the movie's flaws didn't aggravate me greatly, at the end I muttered "ehhhh" to the 95 minutes I had just watched.

    This is one of those movies that time has forgotten, it wasn't a huge success and not a lot of people even know it exists. Too bad that often happens to good films. This film is about you guessed it...Eight heads in a duffel bag. They are supposed to be delivered to a gangster, but end up in the wrong hands and the laughs follow them on their journey. Joe Pesci and Dyan Cannon made me laugh the most here and the rest of the cast were fine too, even if David Spade is in it and is annoying. Pesci has his normal gangster attitude in this movie and thats the Pesci we love, there is no one like him in the biz and he's just one in a million. This movie is worth a watch to anyone that likes their comedies wacky and love to see people getting in weird predicaments. Give it a chance people it will make you smile.

    Perhaps inspired by the Warren Oates classic "Bring Me the Head of Alffredo Garcia", this heads in a bag comedy has a strong opening, and a somewhat ridiculous finish. The actor's do quite well with what is essentially a one joke movie. "8 Heads in a Duffel Bag" starts as black comedy, but eventually morphs into nothing more than slapstick. The ending at the airport is especially weak, as any idea of how to conclude the film seems to have been lost. Nevertheless, the strong, "dark" first half, along with above average comedy material saves the movie, and compared to some of today's lame comedies, I can recommend seeing "8 Heads in a Duffel Bag." - MERK

    The plot is easy to follow. The actors carried it off well and kept the entertainment comical and light. A group of us at work actually watched this on a lunch hour and every one of us appreciated the break. We all felt that the plot was well written, the actors carried the film nicely and that we couldn't have picked a better movie to take a break with. We needed a break from job stress and this movie provided the perfect medicine. We went back to our stressful jobs feeling a lot lighter. I also rented it again for my grandkids who are in their teens. They loved the movie enough to go out and purchase it. I would recommend it to those of you that have a sense of humor and can appreciate comedy. Thanks for the laughs:)

    The 1930s got many misunderstanding comedies, and the 1960s got (It's Mad Mad Mad World) where a lot of people were chasing a suitcase. Although this movie reminded me of both, but in here it's one hell of an original one where the rhythm is highly hot, the backgrounds are nice, the atmosphere is like everything : masterfully light. (Joe Pesci) is on the top of his game, how he looked so charismatic more than ever, and of course his comic performance is flawless. All the rest presented their best despite that they all weren't as good as the lead. Maybe the music wasn't creative inasmuch as traditional which mostly done nothing but overstating the performance, the ending was that unconvincingly fast, and of course the matter of being disgusting.. However it's the late 1990s ! So after a cinematic history of hunting a duffel with important papers, diamonds, money, or anything polite.. It's about time to chase heads (god knows what could be chased after, but I can wonder !). (Robert De Niro) is being spoofed in here at the scene of (Are You Talking to Me ?), and nothing is odd since (Pesci) spoofed himself in here also where he was smashing any payphone like his character in (JFK  1992). The only thing to complain about that when (Joe Pesci) is talking about "retirement" afterwards from being a gangster he really did it yet as an actor in real life ! As he didn't make something during the next 11 years except (Gone Fishin' - 1997), (Lethal Weapon 4 - 1998), and a guest appearance in one very short scene at (The Good Shepherd - 2006) directed by (De Niro). The smartest of it all : (Pesci) throws the nasty blabber mother-in-law out of the van over the mountain, it's classical as it seemed like everyman's dream of any unstoppable nagger comes insanely true !, seeing (George Hamilton) without his famous hair at the closing credits, another dream comes true. The musical nightmare of the heads singing a sick version of Mr. Sandman, that summarizes the whole beauty of it. True that in movies' stories nothing is totally original though here the plot definitely was, along with the wonderful condition that this movie leaves you with.

    I have to start by asking, What kind of a premise is that!? A man who is about to married gets stuck with a duffel bags with specifically eight heads. How did he get the heads? His duffel bag got switched with a hit man's duffel bag on an airplane! Um. Out of all the interesting film premises out there, why on earth does this film have to have that as the premise? So right off, I hated the story. The rest of the film isn't bad. It isn't a particularly funny film, although David Spade and Joe Pesci are really funny in this. I suppose I can recommend it. I just would have preferred that the film didn't have such a weird story. David Spade and Joe Pesci are excellent and it's a different kind of film. That's about all I can say.

    A mob bagman (Joe Pesci) finds that his luggage, containing the proof of his latest hit, has been switched. This was a nice departure for David Spade, stepping away from "Saturday Night Live", though still staying within comedy. Not his best work, but also probably not his fault. As a whole, the movie never really takes off the way it should. The exception is an awesome dream sequence, perhaps one of the better dream sequences ever filmed. Sadly, this one minute is the very best -- the rest of the film does not live up to the great title. Overall, it is quite tame on the violence and gore for the subject matter. If the same story was done without it being comedy, who knows how great this might have been?

    This is one of those movies that time has forgotten, it wasn't a huge success and not a lot of people even know it exists. Too bad that often happens to good films. This film is about you guessed it...Eight heads in a duffel bag. They are supposed to be delivered to a gangster, but end up in the wrong hands and the laughs follow them on their journey. Joe Pesci and Dyan Cannon made me laugh the most here and the rest of the cast were fine too, even if David Spade is in it and is annoying. Pesci has his normal gangster attitude in this movie and thats the Pesci we love, there is no one like him in the biz and he's just one in a million. This movie is worth a watch to anyone that likes their comedies wacky and love to see people getting in weird predicaments. Give it a chance people it will make you smile.

    Perhaps inspired by the Warren Oates classic "Bring Me the Head of Alffredo Garcia", this heads in a bag comedy has a strong opening, and a somewhat ridiculous finish. The actor's do quite well with what is essentially a one joke movie. "8 Heads in a Duffel Bag" starts as black comedy, but eventually morphs into nothing more than slapstick. The ending at the airport is especially weak, as any idea of how to conclude the film seems to have been lost. Nevertheless, the strong, "dark" first half, along with above average comedy material saves the movie, and compared to some of today's lame comedies, I can recommend seeing "8 Heads in a Duffel Bag." - MERK

    The plot is easy to follow. The actors carried it off well and kept the entertainment comical and light. A group of us at work actually watched this on a lunch hour and every one of us appreciated the break. We all felt that the plot was well written, the actors carried the film nicely and that we couldn't have picked a better movie to take a break with. We needed a break from job stress and this movie provided the perfect medicine. We went back to our stressful jobs feeling a lot lighter. I also rented it again for my grandkids who are in their teens. They loved the movie enough to go out and purchase it. I would recommend it to those of you that have a sense of humor and can appreciate comedy. Thanks for the laughs:)

    The 1930s got many misunderstanding comedies, and the 1960s got (It's Mad Mad Mad World) where a lot of people were chasing a suitcase. Although this movie reminded me of both, but in here it's one hell of an original one where the rhythm is highly hot, the backgrounds are nice, the atmosphere is like everything : masterfully light. (Joe Pesci) is on the top of his game, how he looked so charismatic more than ever, and of course his comic performance is flawless. All the rest presented their best despite that they all weren't as good as the lead. Maybe the music wasn't creative inasmuch as traditional which mostly done nothing but overstating the performance, the ending was that unconvincingly fast, and of course the matter of being disgusting.. However it's the late 1990s ! So after a cinematic history of hunting a duffel with important papers, diamonds, money, or anything polite.. It's about time to chase heads (god knows what could be chased after, but I can wonder !). (Robert De Niro) is being spoofed in here at the scene of (Are You Talking to Me ?), and nothing is odd since (Pesci) spoofed himself in here also where he was smashing any payphone like his character in (JFK  1992). The only thing to complain about that when (Joe Pesci) is talking about "retirement" afterwards from being a gangster he really did it yet as an actor in real life ! As he didn't make something during the next 11 years except (Gone Fishin' - 1997), (Lethal Weapon 4 - 1998), and a guest appearance in one very short scene at (The Good Shepherd - 2006) directed by (De Niro). The smartest of it all : (Pesci) throws the nasty blabber mother-in-law out of the van over the mountain, it's classical as it seemed like everyman's dream of any unstoppable nagger comes insanely true !, seeing (George Hamilton) without his famous hair at the closing credits, another dream comes true. The musical nightmare of the heads singing a sick version of Mr. Sandman, that summarizes the whole beauty of it. True that in movies' stories nothing is totally original though here the plot definitely was, along with the wonderful condition that this movie leaves you with.

    I have to start by asking, What kind of a premise is that!? A man who is about to married gets stuck with a duffel bags with specifically eight heads. How did he get the heads? His duffel bag got switched with a hit man's duffel bag on an airplane! Um. Out of all the interesting film premises out there, why on earth does this film have to have that as the premise? So right off, I hated the story. The rest of the film isn't bad. It isn't a particularly funny film, although David Spade and Joe Pesci are really funny in this. I suppose I can recommend it. I just would have preferred that the film didn't have such a weird story. David Spade and Joe Pesci are excellent and it's a different kind of film. That's about all I can say.
