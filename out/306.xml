    The middle part of Queen Victoria's reign is one of the most interesting and unusual among monarchs of the modern age. "Mrs. Brown" (aka, "Her Majesty Mrs. Brown") covers that period. The queen and Prince Albert had been happily married for nearly 21 years when he died of suspected typhoid fever. As the movie opens, Victoria has been long in mourning over his death in 1861. Many months pass, and her family, the royal household, and the parliament want her to return to her public duties and get on with life. Finally, Victoria sends for a personal servant whom Albert had highly regarded at their Balmoral Castle in Scotland. For the next 20 years, John Brown takes charge of the queen's life and the royal household. The queen slowly comes to life again. The Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, convinces Brown of the need for the queen to resume a public life for the sake of the kingdom. Brown helps the queen see the need and wisdom of doing so. Brown is much despised among the royal family, household and officials. Yet, he continued to enjoy a unique position and closeness to the queen until his death from pneumonia in1883. Much about the relationship of Queen Victoria and John Brown remains secret or mysterious. It is still controversial among historians today. But, most agree that Brown's role was helpful to the crown and England. Barely half a century later, another unusual royal relationship would rock Russia. The "mad monk," Rasputin, wielded uncanny and bizarre influence at times over the Romanovs, Nicholas and Alexandra. Rasputin was killed on Dec. 30, 1916, less than two months before the start of the Bolshevik Revolution. He has been viewed by some historians as having helped bring and end to the Russian monarchy. Judi Dench does justice to the character of Victoria, and Billy Connolly is excellent in the role of John Brown. Other roles are all handled very well by a superb cast. The history of the time comes alive in the scenery and settings for the film. But for some curious aspects of this film, I wouldn't have written these comments since there were already many reviews. The first oddity to me was with the lead actress, Judi Dench. Queen Victoria was a short, stout woman, and rather plain looking. If anything, Dench gives her more character in her face. But, she seems way too old at the start of the film  when she should be about 42. And then, she doesn't appear to age at all over the next 20 years. She even seems to be a little younger. This was enough of a distraction to me that I couldn't get into the film  in the time and place, for the maximum enjoyment. Victoria and Albert had nine children. Two died in their 30s and the other seven lived long lives  to an average of 76. At the start of the film, four of them would be teens and three of them younger. We don't see the two youngest at all  Beatrice and Leopold, and the others all appear as older children and young adults. Albert (Bertie) who would become King Edward VII, and Princess Alexandra of Denmark were married in 1863, when he was 21. Any of the film details about Brown and Victoria that may be true were probably taken from the Highland Journal, and its sequel, which Queen Victoria wrote and had published. Otherwise, there don't appear to be any other written or historical accounts. I suspect the notion of a diary kept by Brown was fictitious, since it was destroyed according to the movie. How would anyone know about it otherwise?

    The worst year of Queen Elisabeth II as head of the state was probably not worse than the attention the British royal court got when Queen Victoria got engaged with her groom John Brown 150 years earlier. Unfortunately, it was a completely different time, a another world, and this relationship almost broke down the British monarchy. This movie is very well played. Judi Dench is magnificent as Queen Victoria, an awesome personality with a heartbreaking soul - and this performance earned her an Oscar nomination. Billy Connolly isn't less impressive; a Scottish groom in kilt, brimming with confidence - a free speaking man. Queen Victoria and him are two totally different people, but they fit together very well. The movie is characterized by great acting all over, as well as a good British sense for bygone times; the delicious nature surroundings and a good eye for details. This made the movie a great experience, but I see something about it that took it down a notch: the plot is too quiet in periods, and the script didn't allow room for any reflections. But in any case I did like it.

    I don't want to be slanted towards any film labeled awards-crowned, which would be a surefire guarantee that it is better than average, even though it stars one of my all-time favorite actresses Dame Judi Dench and it is one of her premier glare. HMMB is a British period film from John Madden (whose Shakespeare IN LOVE 1998 would upset the Oscar ceremony in 1999 and honor Ms. Dench's a golden naked man for best supporting actress), wrestling with a solemn relationship/friendship between Queen Victoria and her staunch servant John Brown, a royal entanglement which almost hamper the monarchy in UK history. It is perplexing to tell the narrative's dependability because Brown's diary has never been found, thus the film uses a mediocre approach to meticulously organize its contentious subject matter in a tenable and restrained patterns, the interaction between Queen Victoria and Mr. Brown is not as ample as one had anticipated, a bona-fide friendship never really sensed throughout the entire round, also the screen time of Dame Dench is curbed into sundry fragmentary montages, the sparkle of a two-hander abates slowly and the final showdown has been sketched into a intensive but abrupt manifestation. Ms. Dench rocks in her queenly selfhood, an inscrutably stately potency exuding from every scene she is in and Billy Connolly is not shied away from his zany and inflammable character, a tad hard to swallow but at least spiritually admirable. All in all, the film has extracted a disreputable scandal from the British history and transformed it to an over-cautious biography which shows that it is as bland as the director's emblematic signature of his works.

    This film is about the relationship between Queen Victoria and her personal servant John Brown. While a few have conjectured that their relationship was closer than is portrayed in the film, no real evidence of his appears to exist. However, the film studio marketed the film that way--as if the film was about some sexual or overly-intimate relations existed. The people who actually made the film did a good job of sticking to facts and were probably horrified by the way the film was advertised. The film begins a couple years after the death of Prince Albert--Victoria's husband. His death came as a shock, as he apparently contracted Typhoid from eating fruit and died while still a relatively young man. Victoria was so shocked by the death of her beloved husband that she went into deep depression and refused to come out of mourning or assume her regular duties. Eventually, Brown became her servant and slowly eased her out of this depression and became her closest confidant--and amazing thing since he hadn't an ounce of royal blood. Naturally, this caused a stir--royals resented it and the Prime Minister (Disraeli) was irritated that Brown kept the Queen out of the spotlight--staying with her on a very, very prolonged stay at her home at Balmoral, Scotland. Where all this goes next is something you'll need to see for yourself. As a history teacher, I liked this film as it was more historically accurate than many other films on royalty and British history I have seen (such as "Anne of the Thousand Days", "Mary, Queen of Scots", "The Other Boleyn Girl" and many others). In addition, I like how the film focused on Victoria as a person--a real person with lots of foibles--a rarity in movies. Billy Connelly also did a lovely job as Mr. Brown. I lovely film from start to finish. By the way, the apparent paranoia that John Smith had throughout the movie was VERY justified. During this same time period, Presidents Lincoln and Garfield were assassinated, as were the Empress of Austria-Hungary, as well as Czar Alexander II--among others. And, unsuccessful attempts were made all the time--including one on the Emperor of Austria-Hungary, Franz-Josef.

    If you are expecting this film to be a romance than skip it. It is about the extraordinary man with the ordinary name of John Brown who brought a Queen out of mourning. Not that a whole lot of gossip about Queen Victoria and her Scot's highland servant Brown wasn't bandied about in their day. That's the way it is in court politics, then and now. Judi Dench is the Queen who when this story begins was getting the unflattering nickname of the widow of Windsor. By the merest of chance in these royal arranged marriages it was arranged she should marry a cousin, Albert of Saxe-Coburg Gotha. She and Prince Albert had a good score of married years with several children. They were so happy that when Prince Albert died of typhoid fever in late 1861, Victoria went into a really lengthy mourning period beyond all normal parameters. The woman would have needed grief counseling had it been available back in her day. She shut herself up in Balmoral Castle in Scotland and made no public appearances. Nor would she allow any of her children to substitute for her, particularly the Prince of Wales. With that kind of mentality operating, a whole lot of people questioned the need even for a monarchy. Into her life comes John Brown, brother one of the household help already at Balmoral and hired to tend the Queen's horses. Billy Connolly plays the rough spoken Brown who somehow even through his tough highland talk, endears himself to his Queen with his common sense and total concern for her well being. Gaining the position he does in the Victorian household, Brown makes many enemies who try to bring him down. The period of the film covers when he arrives in the Queen service in 1866 until his death in 1883. Connolly makes a fine Brown though if the film had been made 25 years earlier, the part was made for Sean Connery. Her Majesty, Mrs. Brown gained to Oscar nominations for Judi Dench for Best Actress and for Best Makeup. Shooting on location in the royal palaces and grounds which are nicely preserved from Victoria's time, the film does have the look and feel of Victorian Great Britain and the troubled monarch who reigned over the Empire. Were she and Brown ever physical? I doubt that very much, the very practical Brown was not a stupid man and would never have pushed his luck that much. But he was a tower of strength for the woman whom he brought out of mourning to take her place which was a large one in the world.

    The nature of Queen Victoria's relationship with her Scottish servant John Brown certainly isn't of earth-shaking historical significance, however it does make for an interesting enough story, some good speculation (both in their day and in ours) and a reminder that royal scandal didn't begin with the current crop of British royalty. After the death of her beloved husband Prince Albert, Victoria became very attached to Brown, who in turn became very protective of her. Their relationship was for the most part a very informal one (shockingly so to others, to whom deference to royalty - especially from commoners, and servants to boot! - was the natural state of affairs) and the obvious closeness of their relationship led to rumours and innuendo about the possibility of a love affair between the two. The movie takes no side on whether that happened or not (although the very closing scene, in which two of Victoria's most important counsellors are relieved that Brown's diary was found and that no one else had seen it perhaps implies that "something" had happened) and the reality is that there's no solid historical evidence to suggest that any romance developed between the two. The movie does portray in a very convincing manner the complications of such a friendship: the jealousy felt toward Brown by both his fellow servants (to whom he becomes quite haughty at times, rubbing their noses in his special status) and by other members of the royal family, who feared the potential for scandal and also resented the fact that Brown was closer to Victoria in many ways than they were. The movie is a good period piece. The sets and atmosphere seem authentic and there's some great Scottish scenery in the midst of the story. The movie also features great performances from Judi Dench as Victoria and Billy Connolly as Brown. Also not to be overlooked is a fine performance from Antony Sher as Disraeli - the Prime Minister whose own position as head of government is being threatened by the Queen's increasing unpopularity when she secludes herself for years after Albert's death, and who eventually has to seek Brown's help (because Brown seems to be the only one with influence over her) to get Victoria to reclaim her public role as sovereign. The story may be trivial from a historical perspective, but at least it's interesting trivia!

    I really wanted to see this movie, as I love Judi Dench, and when I saw it was going to show on TV, I knew I had to see it. The result is a very beautiful, touching and brilliantly acted film. Also excellent are the intelligent, sophisticated screenplay and sensitive direction. What made it so beautiful was how it was filmed; beautiful cinematography, scenery, costumes you name it. The music is soothing, pleasant and tender, and the story is somewhat tragic and compelling. And the acting is outstanding, Judi Dench is absolutely mesmerising as Queen Victoria and Billy Connolly was a huge surprise as John Brown, giving a restrained and very moving performance, proving he can do serious roles while being thoroughly decent at comedy as well. Of the supporting performances, I thought the best came from Anthony Sher as Disraeli, and Geoffrey Palmer is also great. Overall, topped with a poignant ending, Mrs Brown is a wonderful film. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    Judi Dench plays Queen Victoria a year before winning her Oscar for playing Queen Elizabeth, and Billy Connolly plays the man who helps her recover from the depression she falls into after the death of her husband. This is a tasteful, quiet period piece that has not much to recommend it cinematically but does give one the opportunity to see some terrific performances. American audiences didn't know who Dench was at the time of this film's release, but that was soon to be corrected. Because she lost the Best Actress Academy Award for this role (to Helen Hunt, of all people), she won the very next year for her 30 seconds of screen time in "Shakespeare in Love" and has been an Oscar regular ever since. She could play a fence post and be nominated now, as long as she did it with a British accent. Grade: B

    Dame Judi Dench is "Mrs. Brown" - that is, Queen Victoria, and Billy Connolly is John Brown in this 1997 film, based on fact, of Queen Victoria's relationship with a Scottsman, John Brown, who becomes her servant. The excellent script is by Jeremy Brock and the director is John Maddon, who does a wonderful job. The widowed, deeply grieving Queen Victoria has basically retired from public life when John Brown, who served her late husband, appears on the scene to help draw her out. Each day, he stands outside with her horse, even though she refuses to ride. Eventually she rides again, and also takes walks. Attracted to his lack of formality, the Queen becomes extremely fond of Brown, making him the object of jealousy at court. Both the stars are magnificent in their roles, and the atmosphere and costumes are perfect. Dame Judi Dench is a queen who is deeply aware of her position and protocol, but also is a vulnerable, sad woman, guilty that her newfound friendship is betraying her husband's memory. One can see her being drawn out slowly by John Brown, and finally enjoying the deep friendship. Connolly is great - tough, uncompromising, and fiercely protective of his Queen, though he realizes after a point that she needs to return to public life. In history, John Brown and Queen Victoria were suspected of being more than friends, thus the name "Mrs. Brown," and in a diary was found the report of a deathbed claim by Rev. Norman Macleod, that he presided over Queen Victoria's marriage to John Brown. This really hasn't been proved, but the Queen was buried with a lock of Brown's hair, his photo, and his mother's wedding ring, as well as Prince Albert's robe. Most historians feel it was only a friendship and point out that after Brown's death, she became close to an Indian servant in much the same way. She obviously needed a confidant after her husband died. The cinematography is breathtaking. A truly beautiful film, highly recommended.

    Judi Dench plays Queen Victoria who several years after the death of her beloved husband Prince Albert is in seclusion and living at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight.It is while she is there that she meets a royal servant John Brown(Billy Connolly)he is put in charge of her horse and is told to await her instructions for if she wishes to ride out any day.Brown is loyal to the royal family but has little patience with Victoria's staff or her son Edward Prince Of Wales who he can see is a spoilt and angry child instead of a mature dignified Prince. After several outings together the Queen strikes up a close friendship with Brown and he tries to allow her to make herself come alive again and stop being depressed about Albert.The Queens aides and the public find their relationship disturbing and find it hard to accept that a common person could mean so much to the monarch. This true story is a love story that has both pain and joy and some outstanding acting and the beautiful locations of the Highlands this is worth watching.

    The middle part of Queen Victoria's reign is one of the most interesting and unusual among monarchs of the modern age. "Mrs. Brown" (aka, "Her Majesty Mrs. Brown") covers that period. The queen and Prince Albert had been happily married for nearly 21 years when he died of suspected typhoid fever. As the movie opens, Victoria has been long in mourning over his death in 1861. Many months pass, and her family, the royal household, and the parliament want her to return to her public duties and get on with life. Finally, Victoria sends for a personal servant whom Albert had highly regarded at their Balmoral Castle in Scotland. For the next 20 years, John Brown takes charge of the queen's life and the royal household. The queen slowly comes to life again. The Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, convinces Brown of the need for the queen to resume a public life for the sake of the kingdom. Brown helps the queen see the need and wisdom of doing so. Brown is much despised among the royal family, household and officials. Yet, he continued to enjoy a unique position and closeness to the queen until his death from pneumonia in1883. Much about the relationship of Queen Victoria and John Brown remains secret or mysterious. It is still controversial among historians today. But, most agree that Brown's role was helpful to the crown and England. Barely half a century later, another unusual royal relationship would rock Russia. The "mad monk," Rasputin, wielded uncanny and bizarre influence at times over the Romanovs, Nicholas and Alexandra. Rasputin was killed on Dec. 30, 1916, less than two months before the start of the Bolshevik Revolution. He has been viewed by some historians as having helped bring and end to the Russian monarchy. Judi Dench does justice to the character of Victoria, and Billy Connolly is excellent in the role of John Brown. Other roles are all handled very well by a superb cast. The history of the time comes alive in the scenery and settings for the film. But for some curious aspects of this film, I wouldn't have written these comments since there were already many reviews. The first oddity to me was with the lead actress, Judi Dench. Queen Victoria was a short, stout woman, and rather plain looking. If anything, Dench gives her more character in her face. But, she seems way too old at the start of the film  when she should be about 42. And then, she doesn't appear to age at all over the next 20 years. She even seems to be a little younger. This was enough of a distraction to me that I couldn't get into the film  in the time and place, for the maximum enjoyment. Victoria and Albert had nine children. Two died in their 30s and the other seven lived long lives  to an average of 76. At the start of the film, four of them would be teens and three of them younger. We don't see the two youngest at all  Beatrice and Leopold, and the others all appear as older children and young adults. Albert (Bertie) who would become King Edward VII, and Princess Alexandra of Denmark were married in 1863, when he was 21. Any of the film details about Brown and Victoria that may be true were probably taken from the Highland Journal, and its sequel, which Queen Victoria wrote and had published. Otherwise, there don't appear to be any other written or historical accounts. I suspect the notion of a diary kept by Brown was fictitious, since it was destroyed according to the movie. How would anyone know about it otherwise?

    The worst year of Queen Elisabeth II as head of the state was probably not worse than the attention the British royal court got when Queen Victoria got engaged with her groom John Brown 150 years earlier. Unfortunately, it was a completely different time, a another world, and this relationship almost broke down the British monarchy. This movie is very well played. Judi Dench is magnificent as Queen Victoria, an awesome personality with a heartbreaking soul - and this performance earned her an Oscar nomination.

Nor would she allow any of her children to substitute for her, particularly the Prince of Wales. With that kind of mentality operating, a whole lot of people questioned the need even for a monarchy. Into her life comes John Brown, brother one of the household help already at Balmoral and hired to tend the Queen's horses. Billy Connolly plays the rough spoken Brown who somehow even through his tough highland talk, endears himself to his Queen with his common sense and total concern for her well being. Gaining the position he does in the Victorian household, Brown makes many enemies who try to bring him down. The period of the film covers when he arrives in the Queen service in 1866 until his death in 1883. Connolly makes a fine Brown though if the film had been made 25 years earlier, the part was made for Sean Connery. Her Majesty, Mrs. Brown gained to Oscar nominations for Judi Dench for Best Actress and for Best Makeup. Shooting on location in the royal palaces and grounds which are nicely preserved from Victoria's time, the film does have the look and feel of Victorian Great Britain and the troubled monarch who reigned over the Empire. Were she and Brown ever physical? I doubt that very much, the very practical Brown was not a stupid man and would never have pushed his luck that much. But he was a tower of strength for the woman whom he brought out of mourning to take her place which was a large one in the world.

    The nature of Queen Victoria's relationship with her Scottish servant John Brown certainly isn't of earth-shaking historical significance, however it does make for an interesting enough story, some good speculation (both in their day and in ours) and a reminder that royal scandal didn't begin with the current crop of British royalty. After the death of her beloved husband Prince Albert, Victoria became very attached to Brown, who in turn became very protective of her. Their relationship was for the most part a very informal one (shockingly so to others, to whom deference to royalty - especially from commoners, and servants to boot! - was the natural state of affairs) and the obvious closeness of their relationship led to rumours and innuendo about the possibility of a love affair between the two. The movie takes no side on whether that happened or not (although the very closing scene, in which two of Victoria's most important counsellors are relieved that Brown's diary was found and that no one else had seen it perhaps implies that "something" had happened) and the reality is that there's no solid historical evidence to suggest that any romance developed between the two. The movie does portray in a very convincing manner the complications of such a friendship: the jealousy felt toward Brown by both his fellow servants (to whom he becomes quite haughty at times, rubbing their noses in his special status) and by other members of the royal family, who feared the potential for scandal and also resented the fact that Brown was closer to Victoria in many ways than they were. The movie is a good period piece. The sets and atmosphere seem authentic and there's some great Scottish scenery in the midst of the story. The movie also features great performances from Judi Dench as Victoria and Billy Connolly as Brown. Also not to be overlooked is a fine performance from Antony Sher as Disraeli - the Prime Minister whose own position as head of government is being threatened by the Queen's increasing unpopularity when she secludes herself for years after Albert's death, and who eventually has to seek Brown's help (because Brown seems to be the only one with influence over her) to get Victoria to reclaim her public role as sovereign. The story may be trivial from a historical perspective, but at least it's interesting trivia!

    I really wanted to see this movie, as I love Judi Dench, and when I saw it was going to show on TV, I knew I had to see it. The result is a very beautiful, touching and brilliantly acted film. Also excellent are the intelligent, sophisticated screenplay and sensitive direction. What made it so beautiful was how it was filmed; beautiful cinematography, scenery, costumes you name it. The music is soothing, pleasant and tender, and the story is somewhat tragic and compelling. And the acting is outstanding, Judi Dench is absolutely mesmerising as Queen Victoria and Billy Connolly was a huge surprise as John Brown, giving a restrained and very moving performance, proving he can do serious roles while being thoroughly decent at comedy as well. Of the supporting performances, I thought the best came from Anthony Sher as Disraeli, and Geoffrey Palmer is also great. Overall, topped with a poignant ending, Mrs Brown is a wonderful film. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    Judi Dench plays Queen Victoria a year before winning her Oscar for playing Queen Elizabeth, and Billy Connolly plays the man who helps her recover from the depression she falls into after the death of her husband. This is a tasteful, quiet period piece that has not much to recommend it cinematically but does give one the opportunity to see some terrific performances. American audiences didn't know who Dench was at the time of this film's release, but that was soon to be corrected. Because she lost the Best Actress Academy Award for this role (to Helen Hunt, of all people), she won the very next year for her 30 seconds of screen time in "Shakespeare in Love" and has been an Oscar regular ever since. She could play a fence post and be nominated now, as long as she did it with a British accent. Grade: B

    Dame Judi Dench is "Mrs. Brown" - that is, Queen Victoria, and Billy Connolly is John Brown in this 1997 film, based on fact, of Queen Victoria's relationship with a Scottsman, John Brown, who becomes her servant. The excellent script is by Jeremy Brock and the director is John Maddon, who does a wonderful job. The widowed, deeply grieving Queen Victoria has basically retired from public life when John Brown, who served her late husband, appears on the scene to help draw her out. Each day, he stands outside with her horse, even though she refuses to ride. Eventually she rides again, and also takes walks. Attracted to his lack of formality, the Queen becomes extremely fond of Brown, making him the object of jealousy at court. Both the stars are magnificent in their roles, and the atmosphere and costumes are perfect. Dame Judi Dench is a queen who is deeply aware of her position and protocol, but also is a vulnerable, sad woman, guilty that her newfound friendship is betraying her husband's memory. One can see her being drawn out slowly by John Brown, and finally enjoying the deep friendship. Connolly is great - tough, uncompromising, and fiercely protective of his Queen, though he realizes after a point that she needs to return to public life. In history, John Brown and Queen Victoria were suspected of being more than friends, thus the name "Mrs. Brown," and in a diary was found the report of a deathbed claim by Rev. Norman Macleod, that he presided over Queen Victoria's marriage to John Brown. This really hasn't been proved, but the Queen was buried with a lock of Brown's hair, his photo, and his mother's wedding ring, as well as Prince Albert's robe. Most historians feel it was only a friendship and point out that after Brown's death, she became close to an Indian servant in much the same way. She obviously needed a confidant after her husband died. The cinematography is breathtaking. A truly beautiful film, highly recommended.

    Judi Dench plays Queen Victoria who several years after the death of her beloved husband Prince Albert is in seclusion and living at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight.It is while she is there that she meets a royal servant John Brown(Billy Connolly)he is put in charge of her horse and is told to await her instructions for if she wishes to ride out any day.Brown is loyal to the royal family but has little patience with Victoria's staff or her son Edward Prince Of Wales who he can see is a spoilt and angry child instead of a mature dignified Prince. After several outings together the Queen strikes up a close friendship with Brown and he tries to allow her to make herself come alive again and stop being depressed about Albert.The Queens aides and the public find their relationship disturbing and find it hard to accept that a common person could mean so much to the monarch. This true story is a love story that has both pain and joy and some outstanding acting and the beautiful locations of the Highlands this is worth watching.

    The middle part of Queen Victoria's reign is one of the most interesting and unusual among monarchs of the modern age. "Mrs. Brown" (aka, "Her Majesty Mrs. Brown") covers that period. The queen and Prince Albert had been happily married for nearly 21 years when he died of suspected typhoid fever. As the movie opens, Victoria has been long in mourning over his death in 1861. Many months pass, and her family, the royal household, and the parliament want her to return to her public duties and get on with life. Finally, Victoria sends for a personal servant whom Albert had highly regarded at their Balmoral Castle in Scotland. For the next 20 years, John Brown takes charge of the queen's life and the royal household. The queen slowly comes to life again. The Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, convinces Brown of the need for the queen to resume a public life for the sake of the kingdom. Brown helps the queen see the need and wisdom of doing so. Brown is much despised among the royal family, household and officials. Yet, he continued to enjoy a unique position and closeness to the queen until his death from pneumonia in1883. Much about the relationship of Queen Victoria and John Brown remains secret or mysterious. It is still controversial among historians today. But, most agree that Brown's role was helpful to the crown and England. Barely half a century later, another unusual royal relationship would rock Russia. The "mad monk," Rasputin, wielded uncanny and bizarre influence at times over the Romanovs, Nicholas and Alexandra. Rasputin was killed on Dec. 30, 1916, less than two months before the start of the Bolshevik Revolution. He has been viewed by some historians as having helped bring and end to the Russian monarchy. Judi Dench does justice to the character of Victoria, and Billy Connolly is excellent in the role of John Brown. Other roles are all handled very well by a superb cast. The history of the time comes alive in the scenery and settings for the film. But for some curious aspects of this film, I wouldn't have written these comments since there were already many reviews. The first oddity to me was with the lead actress, Judi Dench. Queen Victoria was a short, stout woman, and rather plain looking. If anything, Dench gives her more character in her face. But, she seems way too old at the start of the film  when she should be about 42. And then, she doesn't appear to age at all over the next 20 years. She even seems to be a little younger. This was enough of a distraction to me that I couldn't get into the film  in the time and place, for the maximum enjoyment. Victoria and Albert had nine children. Two died in their 30s and the other seven lived long lives  to an average of 76. At the start of the film, four of them would be teens and three of them younger. We don't see the two youngest at all  Beatrice and Leopold, and the others all appear as older children and young adults. Albert (Bertie) who would become King Edward VII, and Princess Alexandra of Denmark were married in 1863, when he was 21. Any of the film details about Brown and Victoria that may be true were probably taken from the Highland Journal, and its sequel, which Queen Victoria wrote and had published. Otherwise, there don't appear to be any other written or historical accounts. I suspect the notion of a diary kept by Brown was fictitious, since it was destroyed according to the movie. How would anyone know about it otherwise?

    The worst year of Queen Elisabeth II as head of the state was probably not worse than the attention the British royal court got when Queen Victoria got engaged with her groom John Brown 150 years earlier. Unfortunately, it was a completely different time, a another world, and this relationship almost broke down the British monarchy. This movie is very well played. Judi Dench is magnificent as Queen Victoria, an awesome personality with a heartbreaking soul - and this performance earned her an Oscar nomination. Billy Connolly isn't less impressive; a Scottish groom in kilt, brimming with confidence - a free speaking man. Queen Victoria and him are two totally different people, but they fit together very well. The movie is characterized by great acting all over, as well as a good British sense for bygone times; the delicious nature surroundings and a good eye for details. This made the movie a great experience, but I see something about it that took it down a notch: the plot is too quiet in periods, and the script didn't allow room for any reflections. But in any case I did like it.

    I don't want to be slanted towards any film labeled awards-crowned, which would be a surefire guarantee that it is better than average, even though it stars one of my all-time favorite actresses Dame Judi Dench and it is one of her premier glare. HMMB is a British period film from John Madden (whose Shakespeare IN LOVE 1998 would upset the Oscar ceremony in 1999 and honor Ms. Dench's a golden naked man for best supporting actress), wrestling with a solemn relationship/friendship between Queen Victoria and her staunch servant John Brown, a royal entanglement which almost hamper the monarchy in UK history. It is perplexing to tell the narrative's dependability because Brown's diary has never been found, thus the film uses a mediocre approach to meticulously organize its contentious subject matter in a tenable and restrained patterns, the interaction between Queen Victoria and Mr. Brown is not as ample as one had anticipated, a bona-fide friendship never really sensed throughout the entire round, also the screen time of Dame Dench is curbed into sundry fragmentary montages, the sparkle of a two-hander abates slowly and the final showdown has been sketched into a intensive but abrupt manifestation. Ms. Dench rocks in her queenly selfhood, an inscrutably stately potency exuding from every scene she is in and Billy Connolly is not shied away from his zany and inflammable character, a tad hard to swallow but at least spiritually admirable. All in all, the film has extracted a disreputable scandal from the British history and transformed it to an over-cautious biography which shows that it is as bland as the director's emblematic signature of his works.

    This film is about the relationship between Queen Victoria and her personal servant John Brown. While a few have conjectured that their relationship was closer than is portrayed in the film, no real evidence of his appears to exist. However, the film studio marketed the film that way--as if the film was about some sexual or overly-intimate relations existed. The people who actually made the film did a good job of sticking to facts and were probably horrified by the way the film was advertised. The film begins a couple years after the death of Prince Albert--Victoria's husband. His death came as a shock, as he apparently contracted Typhoid from eating fruit and died while still a relatively young man. Victoria was so shocked by the death of her beloved husband that she went into deep depression and refused to come out of mourning or assume her regular duties. Eventually, Brown became her servant and slowly eased her out of this depression and became her closest confidant--and amazing thing since he hadn't an ounce of royal blood. Naturally, this caused a stir--royals resented it and the Prime Minister (Disraeli) was irritated that Brown kept the Queen out of the spotlight--staying with her on a very, very prolonged stay at her home at Balmoral, Scotland. Where all this goes next is something you'll need to see for yourself. As a history teacher, I liked this film as it was more historically accurate than many other films on royalty and British history I have seen (such as "Anne of the Thousand Days", "Mary, Queen of Scots", "The Other Boleyn Girl" and many others). In addition, I like how the film focused on Victoria as a person--a real person with lots of foibles--a rarity in movies. Billy Connelly also did a lovely job as Mr. Brown. I lovely film from start to finish. By the way, the apparent paranoia that John Smith had throughout the movie was VERY justified. During this same time period, Presidents Lincoln and Garfield were assassinated, as were the Empress of Austria-Hungary, as well as Czar Alexander II--among others. And, unsuccessful attempts were made all the time--including one on the Emperor of Austria-Hungary, Franz-Josef.

    If you are expecting this film to be a romance than skip it. It is about the extraordinary man with the ordinary name of John Brown who brought a Queen out of mourning. Not that a whole lot of gossip about Queen Victoria and her Scot's highland servant Brown wasn't bandied about in their day. That's the way it is in court politics, then and now. Judi Dench is the Queen who when this story begins was getting the unflattering nickname of the widow of Windsor. By the merest of chance in these royal arranged marriages it was arranged she should marry a cousin, Albert of Saxe-Coburg Gotha. She and Prince Albert had a good score of married years with several children. They were so happy that when Prince Albert died of typhoid fever in late 1861, Victoria went into a really lengthy mourning period beyond all normal parameters. The woman would have needed grief counseling had it been available back in her day. She shut herself up in Balmoral Castle in Scotland and made no public appearances. Nor would she allow any of her children to substitute for her, particularly the Prince of Wales. With that kind of mentality operating, a whole lot of people questioned the need even for a monarchy. Into her life comes John Brown, brother one of the household help already at Balmoral and hired to tend the Queen's horses. Billy Connolly plays the rough spoken Brown who somehow even through his tough highland talk, endears himself to his Queen with his common sense and total concern for her well being. Gaining the position he does in the Victorian household, Brown makes many enemies who try to bring him down. The period of the film covers when he arrives in the Queen service in 1866 until his death in 1883. Connolly makes a fine Brown though if the film had been made 25 years earlier, the part was made for Sean Connery. Her Majesty, Mrs. Brown gained to Oscar nominations for Judi Dench for Best Actress and for Best Makeup. Shooting on location in the royal palaces and grounds which are nicely preserved from Victoria's time, the film does have the look and feel of Victorian Great Britain and the troubled monarch who reigned over the Empire. Were she and Brown ever physical? I doubt that very much, the very practical Brown was not a stupid man and would never have pushed his luck that much. But he was a tower of strength for the woman whom he brought out of mourning to take her place which was a large one in the world.

    The nature of Queen Victoria's relationship with her Scottish servant John Brown certainly isn't of earth-shaking historical significance, however it does make for an interesting enough story, some good speculation (both in their day and in ours) and a reminder that royal scandal didn't begin with the current crop of British royalty. After the death of her beloved husband Prince Albert, Victoria became very attached to Brown, who in turn became very protective of her. Their relationship was for the most part a very informal one (shockingly so to others, to whom deference to royalty - especially from commoners, and servants to boot! - was the natural state of affairs) and the obvious closeness of their relationship led to rumours and innuendo about the possibility of a love affair between the two. The movie takes no side on whether that happened or not (although the very closing scene, in which two of Victoria's most important counsellors are relieved that Brown's diary was found and that no one else had seen it perhaps implies that "something" had happened) and the reality is that there's no solid historical evidence to suggest that any romance developed between the two. The movie does portray in a very convincing manner the complications of such a friendship: the jealousy felt toward Brown by both his fellow servants (to whom he becomes quite haughty at times, rubbing their noses in his special status) and by other members of the royal family, who feared the potential for scandal and also resented the fact that Brown was closer to Victoria in many ways than they were. The movie is a good period piece. The sets and atmosphere seem authentic and there's some great Scottish scenery in the midst of the story. The movie also features great performances from Judi Dench as Victoria and Billy Connolly as Brown. Also not to be overlooked is a fine performance from Antony Sher as Disraeli - the Prime Minister whose own position as head of government is being threatened by the Queen's increasing unpopularity when she secludes herself for years after Albert's death, and who eventually has to seek Brown's help (because Brown seems to be the only one with influence over her) to get Victoria to reclaim her public role as sovereign. The story may be trivial from a historical perspective, but at least it's interesting trivia!

    Judi Dench plays Queen Victoria a year before winning her Oscar for playing Queen Elizabeth, and Billy Connolly plays the man who helps her recover from the depression she falls into after the death of her husband. This is a tasteful, quiet period piece that has not much to recommend it cinematically but does give one the opportunity to see some terrific performances. American audiences didn't know who Dench was at the time of this film's release, but that was soon to be corrected. Because she lost the Best Actress Academy Award for this role (to Helen Hunt, of all people), she won the very next year for her 30 seconds of screen time in "Shakespeare in Love" and has been an Oscar regular ever since. She could play a fence post and be nominated now, as long as she did it with a British accent. Grade: B

    Dame Judi Dench is "Mrs. Brown" - that is, Queen Victoria, and Billy Connolly is John Brown in this 1997 film, based on fact, of Queen Victoria's relationship with a Scottsman, John Brown, who becomes her servant. The excellent script is by Jeremy Brock and the director is John Maddon, who does a wonderful job. The widowed, deeply grieving Queen Victoria has basically retired from public life when John Brown, who served her late husband, appears on the scene to help draw her out. Each day, he stands outside with her horse, even though she refuses to ride. Eventually she rides again, and also takes walks. Attracted to his lack of formality, the Queen becomes extremely fond of Brown, making him the object of jealousy at court. Both the stars are magnificent in their roles, and the atmosphere and costumes are perfect. Dame Judi Dench is a queen who is deeply aware of her position and protocol, but also is a vulnerable, sad woman, guilty that her newfound friendship is betraying her husband's memory. One can see her being drawn out slowly by John Brown, and finally enjoying the deep friendship. Connolly is great - tough, uncompromising, and fiercely protective of his Queen, though he realizes after a point that she needs to return to public life. In history, John Brown and Queen Victoria were suspected of being more than friends, thus the name "Mrs. Brown," and in a diary was found the report of a deathbed claim by Rev. Norman Macleod, that he presided over Queen Victoria's marriage to John Brown. This really hasn't been proved, but the Queen was buried with a lock of Brown's hair, his photo, and his mother's wedding ring, as well as Prince Albert's robe. Most historians feel it was only a friendship and point out that after Brown's death, she became close to an Indian servant in much the same way. She obviously needed a confidant after her husband died. The cinematography is breathtaking. A truly beautiful film, highly recommended.

    The middle part of Queen Victoria's reign is one of the most interesting and unusual among monarchs of the modern age. "Mrs. Brown" (aka, "Her Majesty Mrs. Brown") covers that period. The queen and Prince Albert had been happily married for nearly 21 years when he died of suspected typhoid fever. As the movie opens, Victoria has been long in mourning over his death in 1861. Many months pass, and her family, the royal household, and the parliament want her to return to her public duties and get on with life. Finally, Victoria sends for a personal servant whom Albert had highly regarded at their Balmoral Castle in Scotland. For the next 20 years, John Brown takes charge of the queen's life and the royal household. The queen slowly comes to life again. The Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, convinces Brown of the need for the queen to resume a public life for the sake of the kingdom. Brown helps the queen see the need and wisdom of doing so. Brown is much despised among the royal family, household and officials. Yet, he continued to enjoy a unique position and closeness to the queen until his death from pneumonia in1883. Much about the relationship of Queen Victoria and John Brown remains secret or mysterious. It is still controversial among historians today. But, most agree that Brown's role was helpful to the crown and England. Barely half a century later, another unusual royal relationship would rock Russia. The "mad monk," Rasputin, wielded uncanny and bizarre influence at times over the Romanovs, Nicholas and Alexandra. Rasputin was killed on Dec. 30, 1916, less than two months before the start of the Bolshevik Revolution. He has been viewed by some historians as having helped bring and end to the Russian monarchy. Judi Dench does justice to the character of Victoria, and Billy Connolly is excellent in the role of John Brown. Other roles are all handled very well by a superb cast. The history of the time comes alive in the scenery and settings for the film. But for some curious aspects of this film, I wouldn't have written these comments since there were already many reviews. The first oddity to me was with the lead actress, Judi Dench. Queen Victoria was a short, stout woman, and rather plain looking. If anything, Dench gives her more character in her face. But, she seems way too old at the start of the film  when she should be about 42. And then, she doesn't appear to age at all over the next 20 years. She even seems to be a little younger. This was enough of a distraction to me that I couldn't get into the film  in the time and place, for the maximum enjoyment. Victoria and Albert had nine children. Two died in their 30s and the other seven lived long lives  to an average of 76. At the start of the film, four of them would be teens and three of them younger. We don't see the two youngest at all  Beatrice and Leopold, and the others all appear as older children and young adults. Albert (Bertie) who would become King Edward VII, and Princess Alexandra of Denmark were married in 1863, when he was 21. Any of the film details about Brown and Victoria that may be true were probably taken from the Highland Journal, and its sequel, which Queen Victoria wrote and had published. Otherwise, there don't appear to be any other written or historical accounts. I suspect the notion of a diary kept by Brown was fictitious, since it was destroyed according to the movie. How would anyone know about it otherwise?

    The worst year of Queen Elisabeth II as head of the state was probably not worse than the attention the British royal court got when Queen Victoria got engaged with her groom John Brown 150 years earlier. Unfortunately, it was a completely different time, a another world, and this relationship almost broke down the British monarchy. This movie is very well played. Judi Dench is magnificent as Queen Victoria, an awesome personality with a heartbreaking soul - and this performance earned her an Oscar nomination. Billy Connolly isn't less impressive; a Scottish groom in kilt, brimming with confidence - a free speaking man. Queen Victoria and him are two totally different people, but they fit together very well. The movie is characterized by great acting all over, as well as a good British sense for bygone times; the delicious nature surroundings and a good eye for details. This made the movie a great experience, but I see something about it that took it down a notch: the plot is too quiet in periods, and the script didn't allow room for any reflections. But in any case I did like it.

    I don't want to be slanted towards any film labeled awards-crowned, which would be a surefire guarantee that it is better than average, even though it stars one of my all-time favorite actresses Dame Judi Dench and it is one of her premier glare. HMMB is a British period film from John Madden (whose Shakespeare IN LOVE 1998 would upset the Oscar ceremony in 1999 and honor Ms. Dench's a golden naked man for best supporting actress), wrestling with a solemn relationship/friendship between Queen Victoria and her staunch servant John Brown, a royal entanglement which almost hamper the monarchy in UK history. It is perplexing to tell the narrative's dependability because Brown's diary has never been found, thus the film uses a mediocre approach to meticulously organize its contentious subject matter in a tenable and restrained patterns, the interaction between Queen Victoria and Mr. Brown is not as ample as one had anticipated, a bona-fide friendship never really sensed throughout the entire round, also the screen time of Dame Dench is curbed into sundry fragmentary montages, the sparkle of a two-hander abates slowly and the final showdown has been sketched into a intensive but abrupt manifestation. Ms. Dench rocks in her queenly selfhood, an inscrutably stately potency exuding from every scene she is in and Billy Connolly is not shied away from his zany and inflammable character, a tad hard to swallow but at least spiritually admirable. All in all, the film has extracted a disreputable scandal from the British history and transformed it to an over-cautious biography which shows that it is as bland as the director's emblematic signature of his works.

    This film is about the relationship between Queen Victoria and her personal servant John Brown. While a few have conjectured that their relationship was closer than is portrayed in the film, no real evidence of his appears to exist. However, the film studio marketed the film that way--as if the film was about some sexual or overly-intimate relations existed. The people who actually made the film did a good job of sticking to facts and were probably horrified by the way the film was advertised. The film begins a couple years after the death of Prince Albert--Victoria's husband. His death came as a shock, as he apparently contracted Typhoid from eating fruit and died while still a relatively young man. Victoria was so shocked by the death of her beloved husband that she went into deep depression and refused to come out of mourning or assume her regular duties. Eventually, Brown became her servant and slowly eased her out of this depression and became her closest confidant--and amazing thing since he hadn't an ounce of royal blood. Naturally, this caused a stir--royals resented it and the Prime Minister (Disraeli) was irritated that Brown kept the Queen out of the spotlight--staying with her on a very, very prolonged stay at her home at Balmoral, Scotland. Where all this goes next is something you'll need to see for yourself. As a history teacher, I liked this film as it was more historically accurate than many other films on royalty and British history I have seen (such as "Anne of the Thousand Days", "Mary, Queen of Scots", "The Other Boleyn Girl" and many others). In addition, I like how the film focused on Victoria as a person--a real person with lots of foibles--a rarity in movies. Billy Connelly also did a lovely job as Mr. Brown. I lovely film from start to finish. By the way, the apparent paranoia that John Smith had throughout the movie was VERY justified. During this same time period, Presidents Lincoln and Garfield were assassinated, as were the Empress of Austria-Hungary, as well as Czar Alexander II--among others. And, unsuccessful attempts were made all the time--including one on the Emperor of Austria-Hungary, Franz-Josef.

    If you are expecting this film to be a romance than skip it. It is about the extraordinary man with the ordinary name of John Brown who brought a Queen out of mourning. Not that a whole lot of gossip about Queen Victoria and her Scot's highland servant Brown wasn't bandied about in their day. That's the way it is in court politics, then and now. Judi Dench is the Queen who when this story begins was getting the unflattering nickname of the widow of Windsor. By the merest of chance in these royal arranged marriages it was arranged she should marry a cousin, Albert of Saxe-Coburg Gotha. She and Prince Albert had a good score of married years with several children. They were so happy that when Prince Albert died of typhoid fever in late 1861, Victoria went into a really lengthy mourning period beyond all normal parameters. The woman would have needed grief counseling had it been available back in her day. She shut herself up in Balmoral Castle in Scotland and made no public appearances. Nor would she allow any of her children to substitute for her, particularly the Prince of Wales. With that kind of mentality operating, a whole lot of people questioned the need even for a monarchy. Into her life comes John Brown, brother one of the household help already at Balmoral and hired to tend the Queen's horses. Billy Connolly plays the rough spoken Brown who somehow even through his tough highland talk, endears himself to his Queen with his common sense and total concern for her well being. Gaining the position he does in the Victorian household, Brown makes many enemies who try to bring him down. The period of the film covers when he arrives in the Queen service in 1866 until his death in 1883. Connolly makes a fine Brown though if the film had been made 25 years earlier, the part was made for Sean Connery. Her Majesty, Mrs. Brown gained to Oscar nominations for Judi Dench for Best Actress and for Best Makeup. Shooting on location in the royal palaces and grounds which are nicely preserved from Victoria's time, the film does have the look and feel of Victorian Great Britain and the troubled monarch who reigned over the Empire. Were she and Brown ever physical? I doubt that very much, the very practical Brown was not a stupid man and would never have pushed his luck that much. But he was a tower of strength for the woman whom he brought out of mourning to take her place which was a large one in the world.

    The nature of Queen Victoria's relationship with her Scottish servant John Brown certainly isn't of earth-shaking historical significance, however it does make for an interesting enough story, some good speculation (both in their day and in ours) and a reminder that royal scandal didn't begin with the current crop of British royalty. After the death of her beloved husband Prince Albert, Victoria became very attached to Brown, who in turn became very protective of her. Their relationship was for the most part a very informal one (shockingly so to others, to whom deference to royalty - especially from commoners, and servants to boot! - was the natural state of affairs) and the obvious closeness of their relationship led to rumours and innuendo about the possibility of a love affair between the two. The movie takes no side on whether that happened or not (although the very closing scene, in which two of Victoria's most important counsellors are relieved that Brown's diary was found and that no one else had seen it perhaps implies that "something" had happened) and the reality is that there's no solid historical evidence to suggest that any romance developed between the two. The movie does portray in a very convincing manner the complications of such a friendship: the jealousy felt toward Brown by both his fellow servants (to whom he becomes quite haughty at times, rubbing their noses in his special status) and by other members of the royal family, who feared the potential for scandal and also resented the fact that Brown was closer to Victoria in many ways than they were. The movie is a good period piece. The sets and atmosphere seem authentic and there's some great Scottish scenery in the midst of the story. The movie also features great performances from Judi Dench as Victoria and Billy Connolly as Brown. Also not to be overlooked is a fine performance from Antony Sher as Disraeli - the Prime Minister whose own position as head of government is being threatened by the Queen's increasing unpopularity when she secludes herself for years after Albert's death, and who eventually has to seek Brown's help (because Brown seems to be the only one with influence over her) to get Victoria to reclaim her public role as sovereign. The story may be trivial from a historical perspective, but at least it's interesting trivia!

    I really wanted to see this movie, as I love Judi Dench, and when I saw it was going to show on TV, I knew I had to see it. The result is a very beautiful, touching and brilliantly acted film. Also excellent are the intelligent, sophisticated screenplay and sensitive direction. What made it so beautiful was how it was filmed; beautiful cinematography, scenery, costumes you name it. The music is soothing, pleasant and tender, and the story is somewhat tragic and compelling. And the acting is outstanding, Judi Dench is absolutely mesmerising as Queen Victoria and Billy Connolly was a huge surprise as John Brown, giving a restrained and very moving performance, proving he can do serious roles while being thoroughly decent at comedy as well. Of the supporting performances, I thought the best came from Anthony Sher as Disraeli, and Geoffrey Palmer is also great. Overall, topped with a poignant ending, Mrs Brown is a wonderful film. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    Judi Dench plays Queen Victoria a year before winning her Oscar for playing Queen Elizabeth, and Billy Connolly plays the man who helps her recover from the depression she falls into after the death of her husband. This is a tasteful, quiet period piece that has not much to recommend it cinematically but does give one the opportunity to see some terrific performances. American audiences didn't know who Dench was at the time of this film's release, but that was soon to be corrected. Because she lost the Best Actress Academy Award for this role (to Helen Hunt, of all people), she won the very next year for her 30 seconds of screen time in "Shakespeare in Love" and has been an Oscar regular ever since. She could play a fence post and be nominated now, as long as she did it with a British accent. Grade: B

    Dame Judi Dench is "Mrs. Brown" - that is, Queen Victoria, and Billy Connolly is John Brown in this 1997 film, based on fact, of Queen Victoria's relationship with a Scottsman, John Brown, who becomes her servant. The excellent script is by Jeremy Brock and the director is John Maddon, who does a wonderful job. The widowed, deeply grieving Queen Victoria has basically retired from public life when John Brown, who served her late husband, appears on the scene to help draw her out. Each day, he stands outside with her horse, even though she refuses to ride. Eventually she rides again, and also takes walks. Attracted to his lack of formality, the Queen becomes extremely fond of Brown, making him the object of jealousy at court. Both the stars are magnificent in their roles, and the atmosphere and costumes are perfect. Dame Judi Dench is a queen who is deeply aware of her position and protocol, but also is a vulnerable, sad woman, guilty that her newfound friendship is betraying her husband's memory. One can see her being drawn out slowly by John Brown, and finally enjoying the deep friendship. Connolly is great - tough, uncompromising, and fiercely protective of his Queen, though he realizes after a point that she needs to return to public life. In history, John Brown and Queen Victoria were suspected of being more than friends, thus the name "Mrs. Brown," and in a diary was found the report of a deathbed claim by Rev. Norman Macleod, that he presided over Queen Victoria's marriage to John Brown. This really hasn't been proved, but the Queen was buried with a lock of Brown's hair, his photo, and his mother's wedding ring, as well as Prince Albert's robe. Most historians feel it was only a friendship and point out that after Brown's death, she became close to an Indian servant in much the same way. She obviously needed a confidant after her husband died. The cinematography is breathtaking. A truly beautiful film, highly recommended.

    Judi Dench plays Queen Victoria who several years after the death of her beloved husband Prince Albert is in seclusion and living at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight.It is while she is there that she meets a royal servant John Brown(Billy Connolly)he is put in charge of her horse and is told to await her instructions for if she wishes to ride out any day.Brown is loyal to the royal family but has little patience with Victoria's staff or her son Edward Prince Of Wales who he can see is a spoilt and angry child instead of a mature dignified Prince. After several outings together the Queen strikes up a close friendship with Brown and he tries to allow her to make herself come alive again and stop being depressed about Albert.The Queens aides and the public find their relationship disturbing and find it hard to accept that a common person could mean so much to the monarch. This true story is a love story that has both pain and joy and some outstanding acting and the beautiful locations of the Highlands this is worth watching.

    The middle part of Queen Victoria's reign is one of the most interesting and unusual among monarchs of the modern age. "Mrs. Brown" (aka, "Her Majesty Mrs. Brown") covers that period. The queen and Prince Albert had been happily married for nearly 21 years when he died of suspected typhoid fever. As the movie opens, Victoria has been long in mourning over his death in 1861. Many months pass, and her family, the royal household, and the parliament want her to return to her public duties and get on with life. Finally, Victoria sends for a personal servant whom Albert had highly regarded at their Balmoral Castle in Scotland. For the next 20 years, John Brown takes charge of the queen's life and the royal household. The queen slowly comes to life again. The Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, convinces Brown of the need for the queen to resume a public life for the sake of the kingdom. Brown helps the queen see the need and wisdom of doing so. Brown is much despised among the royal family, household and officials. Yet, he continued to enjoy a unique position and closeness to the queen until his death from pneumonia in1883. Much about the relationship of Queen Victoria and John Brown remains secret or mysterious. It is still controversial among historians today. But, most agree that Brown's role was helpful to the crown and England. Barely half a century later, another unusual royal relationship would rock Russia. The "mad monk," Rasputin, wielded uncanny and bizarre influence at times over the Romanovs, Nicholas and Alexandra. Rasputin was killed on Dec. 30, 1916, less than two months before the start of the Bolshevik Revolution. He has been viewed by some historians as having helped bring and end to the Russian monarchy. Judi Dench does justice to the character of Victoria, and Billy Connolly is excellent in the role of John Brown. Other roles are all handled very well by a superb cast. The history of the time comes alive in the scenery and settings for the film. But for some curious aspects of this film, I wouldn't have written these comments since there were already many reviews. The first oddity to me was with the lead actress, Judi Dench. Queen Victoria was a short, stout woman, and rather plain looking. If anything, Dench gives her more character in her face. But, she seems way too old at the start of the film  when she should be about 42. And then, she doesn't appear to age at all over the next 20 years. She even seems to be a little younger. This was enough of a distraction to me that I couldn't get into the film  in the time and place, for the maximum enjoyment. Victoria and Albert had nine children. Two died in their 30s and the other seven lived long lives  to an average of 76. At the start of the film, four of them would be teens and three of them younger. We don't see the two youngest at all  Beatrice and Leopold, and the others all appear as older children and young adults. Albert (Bertie) who would become King Edward VII, and Princess Alexandra of Denmark were married in 1863, when he was 21. Any of the film details about Brown and Victoria that may be true were probably taken from the Highland Journal, and its sequel, which Queen Victoria wrote and had published. Otherwise, there don't appear to be any other written or historical accounts. I suspect the notion of a diary kept by Brown was fictitious, since it was destroyed according to the movie. How would anyone know about it otherwise?

    The worst year of Queen Elisabeth II as head of the state was probably not worse than the attention the British royal court got when Queen Victoria got engaged with her groom John Brown 150 years earlier. Unfortunately, it was a completely different time, a another world, and this relationship almost broke down the British monarchy. This movie is very well played. Judi Dench is magnificent as Queen Victoria, an awesome personality with a heartbreaking soul - and this performance earned her an Oscar nomination.

This made the movie a great experience, but I see something about it that took it down a notch: the plot is too quiet in periods, and the script didn't allow room for any reflections.

    The nature of Queen Victoria's relationship with her Scottish servant John Brown certainly isn't of earth-shaking historical significance, however it does make for an interesting enough story, some good speculation (both in their day and in ours) and a reminder that royal scandal didn't begin with the current crop of British royalty. After the death of her beloved husband Prince Albert, Victoria became very attached to Brown, who in turn became very protective of her. Their relationship was for the most part a very informal one (shockingly so to others, to whom deference to royalty - especially from commoners, and servants to boot! - was the natural state of affairs) and the obvious closeness of their relationship led to rumours and innuendo about the possibility of a love affair between the two. The movie takes no side on whether that happened or not (although the very closing scene, in which two of Victoria's most important counsellors are relieved that Brown's diary was found and that no one else had seen it perhaps implies that "something" had happened) and the reality is that there's no solid historical evidence to suggest that any romance developed between the two. The movie does portray in a very convincing manner the complications of such a friendship: the jealousy felt toward Brown by both his fellow servants (to whom he becomes quite haughty at times, rubbing their noses in his special status) and by other members of the royal family, who feared the potential for scandal and also resented the fact that Brown was closer to Victoria in many ways than they were. The movie is a good period piece. The sets and atmosphere seem authentic and there's some great Scottish scenery in the midst of the story. The movie also features great performances from Judi Dench as Victoria and Billy Connolly as Brown. Also not to be overlooked is a fine performance from Antony Sher as Disraeli - the Prime Minister whose own position as head of government is being threatened by the Queen's increasing unpopularity when she secludes herself for years after Albert's death, and who eventually has to seek Brown's help (because Brown seems to be the only one with influence over her) to get Victoria to reclaim her public role as sovereign. The story may be trivial from a historical perspective, but at least it's interesting trivia!

    I really wanted to see this movie, as I love Judi Dench, and when I saw it was going to show on TV, I knew I had to see it. The result is a very beautiful, touching and brilliantly acted film. Also excellent are the intelligent, sophisticated screenplay and sensitive direction. What made it so beautiful was how it was filmed; beautiful cinematography, scenery, costumes you name it. The music is soothing, pleasant and tender, and the story is somewhat tragic and compelling. And the acting is outstanding, Judi Dench is absolutely mesmerising as Queen Victoria and Billy Connolly was a huge surprise as John Brown, giving a restrained and very moving performance, proving he can do serious roles while being thoroughly decent at comedy as well. Of the supporting performances, I thought the best came from Anthony Sher as Disraeli, and Geoffrey Palmer is also great. Overall, topped with a poignant ending, Mrs Brown is a wonderful film. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    Judi Dench plays Queen Victoria a year before winning her Oscar for playing Queen Elizabeth, and Billy Connolly plays the man who helps her recover from the depression she falls into after the death of her husband. This is a tasteful, quiet period piece that has not much to recommend it cinematically but does give one the opportunity to see some terrific performances. American audiences didn't know who Dench was at the time of this film's release, but that was soon to be corrected. Because she lost the Best Actress Academy Award for this role (to Helen Hunt, of all people), she won the very next year for her 30 seconds of screen time in "Shakespeare in Love" and has been an Oscar regular ever since. She could play a fence post and be nominated now, as long as she did it with a British accent. Grade: B

    Dame Judi Dench is "Mrs. Brown" - that is, Queen Victoria, and Billy Connolly is John Brown in this 1997 film, based on fact, of Queen Victoria's relationship with a Scottsman, John Brown, who becomes her servant. The excellent script is by Jeremy Brock and the director is John Maddon, who does a wonderful job. The widowed, deeply grieving Queen Victoria has basically retired from public life when John Brown, who served her late husband, appears on the scene to help draw her out. Each day, he stands outside with her horse, even though she refuses to ride. Eventually she rides again, and also takes walks. Attracted to his lack of formality, the Queen becomes extremely fond of Brown, making him the object of jealousy at court. Both the stars are magnificent in their roles, and the atmosphere and costumes are perfect. Dame Judi Dench is a queen who is deeply aware of her position and protocol, but also is a vulnerable, sad woman, guilty that her newfound friendship is betraying her husband's memory. One can see her being drawn out slowly by John Brown, and finally enjoying the deep friendship. Connolly is great - tough, uncompromising, and fiercely protective of his Queen, though he realizes after a point that she needs to return to public life. In history, John Brown and Queen Victoria were suspected of being more than friends, thus the name "Mrs. Brown," and in a diary was found the report of a deathbed claim by Rev. Norman Macleod, that he presided over Queen Victoria's marriage to John Brown. This really hasn't been proved, but the Queen was buried with a lock of Brown's hair, his photo, and his mother's wedding ring, as well as Prince Albert's robe. Most historians feel it was only a friendship and point out that after Brown's death, she became close to an Indian servant in much the same way. She obviously needed a confidant after her husband died. The cinematography is breathtaking. A truly beautiful film, highly recommended.

    Judi Dench plays Queen Victoria who several years after the death of her beloved husband Prince Albert is in seclusion and living at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight.It is while she is there that she meets a royal servant John Brown(Billy Connolly)he is put in charge of her horse and is told to await her instructions for if she wishes to ride out any day.Brown is loyal to the royal family but has little patience with Victoria's staff or her son Edward Prince Of Wales who he can see is a spoilt and angry child instead of a mature dignified Prince. After several outings together the Queen strikes up a close friendship with Brown and he tries to allow her to make herself come alive again and stop being depressed about Albert.The Queens aides and the public find their relationship disturbing and find it hard to accept that a common person could mean so much to the monarch. This true story is a love story that has both pain and joy and some outstanding acting and the beautiful locations of the Highlands this is worth watching.

    The middle part of Queen Victoria's reign is one of the most interesting and unusual among monarchs of the modern age. "Mrs. Brown" (aka, "Her Majesty Mrs. Brown") covers that period. The queen and Prince Albert had been happily married for nearly 21 years when he died of suspected typhoid fever. As the movie opens, Victoria has been long in mourning over his death in 1861. Many months pass, and her family, the royal household, and the parliament want her to return to her public duties and get on with life. Finally, Victoria sends for a personal servant whom Albert had highly regarded at their Balmoral Castle in Scotland. For the next 20 years, John Brown takes charge of the queen's life and the royal household. The queen slowly comes to life again. The Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, convinces Brown of the need for the queen to resume a public life for the sake of the kingdom. Brown helps the queen see the need and wisdom of doing so. Brown is much despised among the royal family, household and officials. Yet, he continued to enjoy a unique position and closeness to the queen until his death from pneumonia in1883. Much about the relationship of Queen Victoria and John Brown remains secret or mysterious. It is still controversial among historians today. But, most agree that Brown's role was helpful to the crown and England. Barely half a century later, another unusual royal relationship would rock Russia. The "mad monk," Rasputin, wielded uncanny and bizarre influence at times over the Romanovs, Nicholas and Alexandra. Rasputin was killed on Dec. 30, 1916, less than two months before the start of the Bolshevik Revolution. He has been viewed by some historians as having helped bring and end to the Russian monarchy. Judi Dench does justice to the character of Victoria, and Billy Connolly is excellent in the role of John Brown. Other roles are all handled very well by a superb cast. The history of the time comes alive in the scenery and settings for the film. But for some curious aspects of this film, I wouldn't have written these comments since there were already many reviews. The first oddity to me was with the lead actress, Judi Dench. Queen Victoria was a short, stout woman, and rather plain looking. If anything, Dench gives her more character in her face. But, she seems way too old at the start of the film  when she should be about 42. And then, she doesn't appear to age at all over the next 20 years. She even seems to be a little younger. This was enough of a distraction to me that I couldn't get into the film  in the time and place, for the maximum enjoyment. Victoria and Albert had nine children. Two died in their 30s and the other seven lived long lives  to an average of 76. At the start of the film, four of them would be teens and three of them younger. We don't see the two youngest at all  Beatrice and Leopold, and the others all appear as older children and young adults. Albert (Bertie) who would become King Edward VII, and Princess Alexandra of Denmark were married in 1863, when he was 21. Any of the film details about Brown and Victoria that may be true were probably taken from the Highland Journal, and its sequel, which Queen Victoria wrote and had published. Otherwise, there don't appear to be any other written or historical accounts. I suspect the notion of a diary kept by Brown was fictitious, since it was destroyed according to the movie. How would anyone know about it otherwise?

    The worst year of Queen Elisabeth II as head of the state was probably not worse than the attention the British royal court got when Queen Victoria got engaged with her groom John Brown 150 years earlier. Unfortunately, it was a completely different time, a another world, and this relationship almost broke down the British monarchy. This movie is very well played. Judi Dench is magnificent as Queen Victoria, an awesome personality with a heartbreaking soul - and this performance earned her an Oscar nomination. Billy Connolly isn't less impressive; a Scottish groom in kilt, brimming with confidence - a free speaking man. Queen Victoria and him are two totally different people, but they fit together very well. The movie is characterized by great acting all over, as well as a good British sense for bygone times; the delicious nature surroundings and a good eye for details. This made the movie a great experience, but I see something about it that took it down a notch: the plot is too quiet in periods, and the script didn't allow room for any reflections. But in any case I did like it.

    I don't want to be slanted towards any film labeled awards-crowned, which would be a surefire guarantee that it is better than average, even though it stars one of my all-time favorite actresses Dame Judi Dench and it is one of her premier glare. HMMB is a British period film from John Madden (whose Shakespeare IN LOVE 1998 would upset the Oscar ceremony in 1999 and honor Ms. Dench's a golden naked man for best supporting actress), wrestling with a solemn relationship/friendship between Queen Victoria and her staunch servant John Brown, a royal entanglement which almost hamper the monarchy in UK history. It is perplexing to tell the narrative's dependability because Brown's diary has never been found, thus the film uses a mediocre approach to meticulously organize its contentious subject matter in a tenable and restrained patterns, the interaction between Queen Victoria and Mr. Brown is not as ample as one had anticipated, a bona-fide friendship never really sensed throughout the entire round, also the screen time of Dame Dench is curbed into sundry fragmentary montages, the sparkle of a two-hander abates slowly and the final showdown has been sketched into a intensive but abrupt manifestation. Ms. Dench rocks in her queenly selfhood, an inscrutably stately potency exuding from every scene she is in and Billy Connolly is not shied away from his zany and inflammable character, a tad hard to swallow but at least spiritually admirable. All in all, the film has extracted a disreputable scandal from the British history and transformed it to an over-cautious biography which shows that it is as bland as the director's emblematic signature of his works.

    This film is about the relationship between Queen Victoria and her personal servant John Brown. While a few have conjectured that their relationship was closer than is portrayed in the film, no real evidence of his appears to exist. However, the film studio marketed the film that way--as if the film was about some sexual or overly-intimate relations existed. The people who actually made the film did a good job of sticking to facts and were probably horrified by the way the film was advertised. The film begins a couple years after the death of Prince Albert--Victoria's husband. His death came as a shock, as he apparently contracted Typhoid from eating fruit and died while still a relatively young man. Victoria was so shocked by the death of her beloved husband that she went into deep depression and refused to come out of mourning or assume her regular duties. Eventually, Brown became her servant and slowly eased her out of this depression and became her closest confidant--and amazing thing since he hadn't an ounce of royal blood. Naturally, this caused a stir--royals resented it and the Prime Minister (Disraeli) was irritated that Brown kept the Queen out of the spotlight--staying with her on a very, very prolonged stay at her home at Balmoral, Scotland. Where all this goes next is something you'll need to see for yourself. As a history teacher, I liked this film as it was more historically accurate than many other films on royalty and British history I have seen (such as "Anne of the Thousand Days", "Mary, Queen of Scots", "The Other Boleyn Girl" and many others). In addition, I like how the film focused on Victoria as a person--a real person with lots of foibles--a rarity in movies. Billy Connelly also did a lovely job as Mr. Brown. I lovely film from start to finish. By the way, the apparent paranoia that John Smith had throughout the movie was VERY justified. During this same time period, Presidents Lincoln and Garfield were assassinated, as were the Empress of Austria-Hungary, as well as Czar Alexander II--among others. And, unsuccessful attempts were made all the time--including one on the Emperor of Austria-Hungary, Franz-Josef.

    If you are expecting this film to be a romance than skip it. It is about the extraordinary man with the ordinary name of John Brown who brought a Queen out of mourning. Not that a whole lot of gossip about Queen Victoria and her Scot's highland servant Brown wasn't bandied about in their day. That's the way it is in court politics, then and now. Judi Dench is the Queen who when this story begins was getting the unflattering nickname of the widow of Windsor. By the merest of chance in these royal arranged marriages it was arranged she should marry a cousin, Albert of Saxe-Coburg Gotha. She and Prince Albert had a good score of married years with several children. They were so happy that when Prince Albert died of typhoid fever in late 1861, Victoria went into a really lengthy mourning period beyond all normal parameters. The woman would have needed grief counseling had it been available back in her day. She shut herself up in Balmoral Castle in Scotland and made no public appearances. Nor would she allow any of her children to substitute for her, particularly the Prince of Wales. With that kind of mentality operating, a whole lot of people questioned the need even for a monarchy. Into her life comes John Brown, brother one of the household help already at Balmoral and hired to tend the Queen's horses. Billy Connolly plays the rough spoken Brown who somehow even through his tough highland talk, endears himself to his Queen with his common sense and total concern for her well being. Gaining the position he does in the Victorian household, Brown makes many enemies who try to bring him down. The period of the film covers when he arrives in the Queen service in 1866 until his death in 1883. Connolly makes a fine Brown though if the film had been made 25 years earlier, the part was made for Sean Connery. Her Majesty, Mrs. Brown gained to Oscar nominations for Judi Dench for Best Actress and for Best Makeup. Shooting on location in the royal palaces and grounds which are nicely preserved from Victoria's time, the film does have the look and feel of Victorian Great Britain and the troubled monarch who reigned over the Empire. Were she and Brown ever physical? I doubt that very much, the very practical Brown was not a stupid man and would never have pushed his luck that much. But he was a tower of strength for the woman whom he brought out of mourning to take her place which was a large one in the world.

    The nature of Queen Victoria's relationship with her Scottish servant John Brown certainly isn't of earth-shaking historical significance, however it does make for an interesting enough story, some good speculation (both in their day and in ours) and a reminder that royal scandal didn't begin with the current crop of British royalty. After the death of her beloved husband Prince Albert, Victoria became very attached to Brown, who in turn became very protective of her. Their relationship was for the most part a very informal one (shockingly so to others, to whom deference to royalty - especially from commoners, and servants to boot! - was the natural state of affairs) and the obvious closeness of their relationship led to rumours and innuendo about the possibility of a love affair between the two. The movie takes no side on whether that happened or not (although the very closing scene, in which two of Victoria's most important counsellors are relieved that Brown's diary was found and that no one else had seen it perhaps implies that "something" had happened) and the reality is that there's no solid historical evidence to suggest that any romance developed between the two. The movie does portray in a very convincing manner the complications of such a friendship: the jealousy felt toward Brown by both his fellow servants (to whom he becomes quite haughty at times, rubbing their noses in his special status) and by other members of the royal family, who feared the potential for scandal and also resented the fact that Brown was closer to Victoria in many ways than they were. The movie is a good period piece. The sets and atmosphere seem authentic and there's some great Scottish scenery in the midst of the story. The movie also features great performances from Judi Dench as Victoria and Billy Connolly as Brown. Also not to be overlooked is a fine performance from Antony Sher as Disraeli - the Prime Minister whose own position as head of government is being threatened by the Queen's increasing unpopularity when she secludes herself for years after Albert's death, and who eventually has to seek Brown's help (because Brown seems to be the only one with influence over her) to get Victoria to reclaim her public role as sovereign. The story may be trivial from a historical perspective, but at least it's interesting trivia!

Also excellent are the intelligent, sophisticated screenplay and sensitive direction. What made it so beautiful was how it was filmed; beautiful cinematography, scenery, costumes you name it.

And the acting is outstanding, Judi Dench is absolutely mesmerising as Queen Victoria and Billy Connolly was a huge surprise as John Brown, giving a restrained and very moving performance, proving he can do serious roles while being thoroughly decent at comedy as well. Of the supporting performances, I thought the best came from Anthony Sher as Disraeli, and Geoffrey Palmer is also great. Overall, topped with a poignant ending, Mrs Brown is a wonderful film. 10/10 Bethany Cox

This is a tasteful, quiet period piece that has not much to recommend it cinematically but does give one the opportunity to see some terrific performances. American audiences didn't know who Dench was at the time of this film's release, but that was soon to be corrected. Because she lost the Best Actress Academy Award for this role (to Helen Hunt, of all people), she won the very next year for her 30 seconds of screen time in "Shakespeare in Love" and has been an Oscar regular ever since.

    Dame Judi Dench is "Mrs. Brown" - that is, Queen Victoria, and Billy Connolly is John Brown in this 1997 film, based on fact, of Queen Victoria's relationship with a Scottsman, John Brown, who becomes her servant. The excellent script is by Jeremy Brock and the director is John Maddon, who does a wonderful job. The widowed, deeply grieving Queen Victoria has basically retired from public life when John Brown, who served her late husband, appears on the scene to help draw her out. Each day, he stands outside with her horse, even though she refuses to ride. Eventually she rides again, and also takes walks. Attracted to his lack of formality, the Queen becomes extremely fond of Brown, making him the object of jealousy at court. Both the stars are magnificent in their roles, and the atmosphere and costumes are perfect. Dame Judi Dench is a queen who is deeply aware of her position and protocol, but also is a vulnerable, sad woman, guilty that her newfound friendship is betraying her husband's memory. One can see her being drawn out slowly by John Brown, and finally enjoying the deep friendship. Connolly is great - tough, uncompromising, and fiercely protective of his Queen, though he realizes after a point that she needs to return to public life. In history, John Brown and Queen Victoria were suspected of being more than friends, thus the name "Mrs. Brown," and in a diary was found the report of a deathbed claim by Rev. Norman Macleod, that he presided over Queen Victoria's marriage to John Brown. This really hasn't been proved, but the Queen was buried with a lock of Brown's hair, his photo, and his mother's wedding ring, as well as Prince Albert's robe. Most historians feel it was only a friendship and point out that after Brown's death, she became close to an Indian servant in much the same way. She obviously needed a confidant after her husband died. The cinematography is breathtaking. A truly beautiful film, highly recommended.

    The middle part of Queen Victoria's reign is one of the most interesting and unusual among monarchs of the modern age. "Mrs. Brown" (aka, "Her Majesty Mrs. Brown") covers that period. The queen and Prince Albert had been happily married for nearly 21 years when he died of suspected typhoid fever. As the movie opens, Victoria has been long in mourning over his death in 1861. Many months pass, and her family, the royal household, and the parliament want her to return to her public duties and get on with life. Finally, Victoria sends for a personal servant whom Albert had highly regarded at their Balmoral Castle in Scotland. For the next 20 years, John Brown takes charge of the queen's life and the royal household. The queen slowly comes to life again. The Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, convinces Brown of the need for the queen to resume a public life for the sake of the kingdom. Brown helps the queen see the need and wisdom of doing so. Brown is much despised among the royal family, household and officials. Yet, he continued to enjoy a unique position and closeness to the queen until his death from pneumonia in1883. Much about the relationship of Queen Victoria and John Brown remains secret or mysterious. It is still controversial among historians today. But, most agree that Brown's role was helpful to the crown and England. Barely half a century later, another unusual royal relationship would rock Russia. The "mad monk," Rasputin, wielded uncanny and bizarre influence at times over the Romanovs, Nicholas and Alexandra. Rasputin was killed on Dec. 30, 1916, less than two months before the start of the Bolshevik Revolution. He has been viewed by some historians as having helped bring and end to the Russian monarchy. Judi Dench does justice to the character of Victoria, and Billy Connolly is excellent in the role of John Brown. Other roles are all handled very well by a superb cast. The history of the time comes alive in the scenery and settings for the film. But for some curious aspects of this film, I wouldn't have written these comments since there were already many reviews. The first oddity to me was with the lead actress, Judi Dench. Queen Victoria was a short, stout woman, and rather plain looking. If anything, Dench gives her more character in her face. But, she seems way too old at the start of the film  when she should be about 42. And then, she doesn't appear to age at all over the next 20 years. She even seems to be a little younger. This was enough of a distraction to me that I couldn't get into the film  in the time and place, for the maximum enjoyment. Victoria and Albert had nine children. Two died in their 30s and the other seven lived long lives  to an average of 76. At the start of the film, four of them would be teens and three of them younger. We don't see the two youngest at all  Beatrice and Leopold, and the others all appear as older children and young adults. Albert (Bertie) who would become King Edward VII, and Princess Alexandra of Denmark were married in 1863, when he was 21. Any of the film details about Brown and Victoria that may be true were probably taken from the Highland Journal, and its sequel, which Queen Victoria wrote and had published. Otherwise, there don't appear to be any other written or historical accounts. I suspect the notion of a diary kept by Brown was fictitious, since it was destroyed according to the movie. How would anyone know about it otherwise?

    The worst year of Queen Elisabeth II as head of the state was probably not worse than the attention the British royal court got when Queen Victoria got engaged with her groom John Brown 150 years earlier. Unfortunately, it was a completely different time, a another world, and this relationship almost broke down the British monarchy. This movie is very well played. Judi Dench is magnificent as Queen Victoria, an awesome personality with a heartbreaking soul - and this performance earned her an Oscar nomination. Billy Connolly isn't less impressive; a Scottish groom in kilt, brimming with confidence - a free speaking man.

This made the movie a great experience, but I see something about it that took it down a notch: the plot is too quiet in periods, and the script didn't allow room for any reflections.

    This film is about the relationship between Queen Victoria and her personal servant John Brown. While a few have conjectured that their relationship was closer than is portrayed in the film, no real evidence of his appears to exist. However, the film studio marketed the film that way--as if the film was about some sexual or overly-intimate relations existed. The people who actually made the film did a good job of sticking to facts and were probably horrified by the way the film was advertised. The film begins a couple years after the death of Prince Albert--Victoria's husband. His death came as a shock, as he apparently contracted Typhoid from eating fruit and died while still a relatively young man. Victoria was so shocked by the death of her beloved husband that she went into deep depression and refused to come out of mourning or assume her regular duties. Eventually, Brown became her servant and slowly eased her out of this depression and became her closest confidant--and amazing thing since he hadn't an ounce of royal blood. Naturally, this caused a stir--royals resented it and the Prime Minister (Disraeli) was irritated that Brown kept the Queen out of the spotlight--staying with her on a very, very prolonged stay at her home at Balmoral, Scotland. Where all this goes next is something you'll need to see for yourself. As a history teacher, I liked this film as it was more historically accurate than many other films on royalty and British history I have seen (such as "Anne of the Thousand Days", "Mary, Queen of Scots", "The Other Boleyn Girl" and many others). In addition, I like how the film focused on Victoria as a person--a real person with lots of foibles--a rarity in movies. Billy Connelly also did a lovely job as Mr. Brown. I lovely film from start to finish. By the way, the apparent paranoia that John Smith had throughout the movie was VERY justified. During this same time period, Presidents Lincoln and Garfield were assassinated, as were the Empress of Austria-Hungary, as well as Czar Alexander II--among others. And, unsuccessful attempts were made all the time--including one on the Emperor of Austria-Hungary, Franz-Josef.

    If you are expecting this film to be a romance than skip it. It is about the extraordinary man with the ordinary name of John Brown who brought a Queen out of mourning. Not that a whole lot of gossip about Queen Victoria and her Scot's highland servant Brown wasn't bandied about in their day. That's the way it is in court politics, then and now. Judi Dench is the Queen who when this story begins was getting the unflattering nickname of the widow of Windsor. By the merest of chance in these royal arranged marriages it was arranged she should marry a cousin, Albert of Saxe-Coburg Gotha. She and Prince Albert had a good score of married years with several children. They were so happy that when Prince Albert died of typhoid fever in late 1861, Victoria went into a really lengthy mourning period beyond all normal parameters. The woman would have needed grief counseling had it been available back in her day. She shut herself up in Balmoral Castle in Scotland and made no public appearances. Nor would she allow any of her children to substitute for her, particularly the Prince of Wales. With that kind of mentality operating, a whole lot of people questioned the need even for a monarchy. Into her life comes John Brown, brother one of the household help already at Balmoral and hired to tend the Queen's horses. Billy Connolly plays the rough spoken Brown who somehow even through his tough highland talk, endears himself to his Queen with his common sense and total concern for her well being. Gaining the position he does in the Victorian household, Brown makes many enemies who try to bring him down. The period of the film covers when he arrives in the Queen service in 1866 until his death in 1883. Connolly makes a fine Brown though if the film had been made 25 years earlier, the part was made for Sean Connery. Her Majesty, Mrs. Brown gained to Oscar nominations for Judi Dench for Best Actress and for Best Makeup. Shooting on location in the royal palaces and grounds which are nicely preserved from Victoria's time, the film does have the look and feel of Victorian Great Britain and the troubled monarch who reigned over the Empire. Were she and Brown ever physical? I doubt that very much, the very practical Brown was not a stupid man and would never have pushed his luck that much. But he was a tower of strength for the woman whom he brought out of mourning to take her place which was a large one in the world.

    The nature of Queen Victoria's relationship with her Scottish servant John Brown certainly isn't of earth-shaking historical significance, however it does make for an interesting enough story, some good speculation (both in their day and in ours) and a reminder that royal scandal didn't begin with the current crop of British royalty. After the death of her beloved husband Prince Albert, Victoria became very attached to Brown, who in turn became very protective of her. Their relationship was for the most part a very informal one (shockingly so to others, to whom deference to royalty - especially from commoners, and servants to boot! - was the natural state of affairs) and the obvious closeness of their relationship led to rumours and innuendo about the possibility of a love affair between the two. The movie takes no side on whether that happened or not (although the very closing scene, in which two of Victoria's most important counsellors are relieved that Brown's diary was found and that no one else had seen it perhaps implies that "something" had happened) and the reality is that there's no solid historical evidence to suggest that any romance developed between the two. The movie does portray in a very convincing manner the complications of such a friendship: the jealousy felt toward Brown by both his fellow servants (to whom he becomes quite haughty at times, rubbing their noses in his special status) and by other members of the royal family, who feared the potential for scandal and also resented the fact that Brown was closer to Victoria in many ways than they were. The movie is a good period piece. The sets and atmosphere seem authentic and there's some great Scottish scenery in the midst of the story. The movie also features great performances from Judi Dench as Victoria and Billy Connolly as Brown. Also not to be overlooked is a fine performance from Antony Sher as Disraeli - the Prime Minister whose own position as head of government is being threatened by the Queen's increasing unpopularity when she secludes herself for years after Albert's death, and who eventually has to seek Brown's help (because Brown seems to be the only one with influence over her) to get Victoria to reclaim her public role as sovereign. The story may be trivial from a historical perspective, but at least it's interesting trivia!

    I really wanted to see this movie, as I love Judi Dench, and when I saw it was going to show on TV, I knew I had to see it. The result is a very beautiful, touching and brilliantly acted film. Also excellent are the intelligent, sophisticated screenplay and sensitive direction. What made it so beautiful was how it was filmed; beautiful cinematography, scenery, costumes you name it. The music is soothing, pleasant and tender, and the story is somewhat tragic and compelling. And the acting is outstanding, Judi Dench is absolutely mesmerising as Queen Victoria and Billy Connolly was a huge surprise as John Brown, giving a restrained and very moving performance, proving he can do serious roles while being thoroughly decent at comedy as well. Of the supporting performances, I thought the best came from Anthony Sher as Disraeli, and Geoffrey Palmer is also great. Overall, topped with a poignant ending, Mrs Brown is a wonderful film. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    Judi Dench plays Queen Victoria a year before winning her Oscar for playing Queen Elizabeth, and Billy Connolly plays the man who helps her recover from the depression she falls into after the death of her husband. This is a tasteful, quiet period piece that has not much to recommend it cinematically but does give one the opportunity to see some terrific performances. American audiences didn't know who Dench was at the time of this film's release, but that was soon to be corrected. Because she lost the Best Actress Academy Award for this role (to Helen Hunt, of all people), she won the very next year for her 30 seconds of screen time in "Shakespeare in Love" and has been an Oscar regular ever since. She could play a fence post and be nominated now, as long as she did it with a British accent. Grade: B

    Dame Judi Dench is "Mrs. Brown" - that is, Queen Victoria, and Billy Connolly is John Brown in this 1997 film, based on fact, of Queen Victoria's relationship with a Scottsman, John Brown, who becomes her servant. The excellent script is by Jeremy Brock and the director is John Maddon, who does a wonderful job. The widowed, deeply grieving Queen Victoria has basically retired from public life when John Brown, who served her late husband, appears on the scene to help draw her out. Each day, he stands outside with her horse, even though she refuses to ride. Eventually she rides again, and also takes walks. Attracted to his lack of formality, the Queen becomes extremely fond of Brown, making him the object of jealousy at court. Both the stars are magnificent in their roles, and the atmosphere and costumes are perfect. Dame Judi Dench is a queen who is deeply aware of her position and protocol, but also is a vulnerable, sad woman, guilty that her newfound friendship is betraying her husband's memory. One can see her being drawn out slowly by John Brown, and finally enjoying the deep friendship. Connolly is great - tough, uncompromising, and fiercely protective of his Queen, though he realizes after a point that she needs to return to public life. In history, John Brown and Queen Victoria were suspected of being more than friends, thus the name "Mrs. Brown," and in a diary was found the report of a deathbed claim by Rev. Norman Macleod, that he presided over Queen Victoria's marriage to John Brown. This really hasn't been proved, but the Queen was buried with a lock of Brown's hair, his photo, and his mother's wedding ring, as well as Prince Albert's robe. Most historians feel it was only a friendship and point out that after Brown's death, she became close to an Indian servant in much the same way. She obviously needed a confidant after her husband died. The cinematography is breathtaking. A truly beautiful film, highly recommended.

    Judi Dench plays Queen Victoria who several years after the death of her beloved husband Prince Albert is in seclusion and living at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight.It is while she is there that she meets a royal servant John Brown(Billy Connolly)he is put in charge of her horse and is told to await her instructions for if she wishes to ride out any day.Brown is loyal to the royal family but has little patience with Victoria's staff or her son Edward Prince Of Wales who he can see is a spoilt and angry child instead of a mature dignified Prince. After several outings together the Queen strikes up a close friendship with Brown and he tries to allow her to make herself come alive again and stop being depressed about Albert.The Queens aides and the public find their relationship disturbing and find it hard to accept that a common person could mean so much to the monarch. This true story is a love story that has both pain and joy and some outstanding acting and the beautiful locations of the Highlands this is worth watching.
