    Many films have their hearts in the right place, but just can't close the deal. Now, this does have a great setup, and it takes you to an interesting place. At the same time, about half an hour could have been cut from the film. For the most part, while predictable the writing does well with its premise. I don't think I was ever surprised by anything. Duvall gives a great award-worthy performance, and his character has charisma. The film, however, falls too much in love with it, goes off on a tangent, and it is bound and determined not to end. The length of the climactic scene - if you can call it that - undermined the story's emotional impact. The film benefits from its cast, but Billy Bob Thornton and Miranda Richardson were the only supporting actors who added much depth to the plot. If you're looking for a similar Christian tale of redemption set in the Deep South, I would recommend Black Snake Moan. I found that one to have a better pace, more interesting characters, and tighter writing.

    i waited to see this movie. i guess i was afraid. i watched "the apostle" tonight! it gripped me from the first turn of the reels. i have always adored robert duvall! "convicts" is also one of his best roles! and, let us not forget "lonesome dove"! i could not believe the fact that he also directed this movie, as well. i know it was made back in 1997, but, i just saw it tonight. robert duvall-you are one of the finest actors to ever come out of the back woods of this great country of ours! the tragedy is you did not make more movies in which you were also given the chance to direct! i take my hat off to you, fine sir! hats off, gentlemen, to a genius!!

    This is one of those rare Performances that seems to transcend Acting. Robert Duvall is the Apostille, one might say. A firebrand force, a Jesus Juggernaut, a Preacher who will not be denied. He will invoke Jesus' Name until it literally drives Satan away holding his ears. The trouble, as far as this Movie goes, it may drive Viewers away with its relentless Bible Thumping and sing-song Religious Rants, most shouted at supreme volume, with or without the aid of a microphone or Amplitude Modulation. There is so much of this and it is so intense that it almost, but not quite, leaves the more subtle, sublime elements drowning in a Sea of self-indulgence. There is much to admire in this singular effort from the Producer/Writer/Star/Director. The backdrops all have a realism of Rural, Southern Americana and the Cast are all fitting and the combination of Pros and Extras add an almost Documentary feel. Much praise and much Screen time is given to Stylistic Sermonizing by the Apostille and although it is totally believable and compelling, there maybe just too much of a Good thing. Overall, this gallant effort is not without its Sins and is quite an Excellent Character Study. A bit of editing and just a little restraint may have made this a Masterpiece.

    After bringing scores of souls to accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, evangelical Texas preacher Robert Duvall (as Euless "Sonny" Dewey) finds his Christian career threatened by infidelity. Cheating wife Farrah Fawcett (as Jessie) wants a divorce. Enraged, Mr. Duvall takes a fatal swing at Ms. Fawcett's young lover Todd Allen (as Horace). On the run from the police, Duvall changes his identity to "Apostle E.F." and begins a new preaching career in partnership with retired Louisiana minister John Beasley (as Charles Blackwell). Success includes a radio show, which is eventually heard by... The opening scenes include Duvall as a boy, which may not be clear (unless you watch it a second time). The setting is 1969, and jumps ahead with no notification. There is also something odd about mother June Carter Cash, who possibly likes to play possum. Another early concern is that Duvall, who also wrote and directed, holds back on his character's own sexual indiscretions. These are referenced as "wanderin' eye" and "womanizing" in the script, but a concentrated attention is required. Consequently, Fawcett appears to be the wicked home-wrecker. She also wants to steal Duvall's congregation... Duvall's preacher is a violent, vociferous and self-centered liar. However, he does appear to be a genuine believer. Why he avoids accepting responsibility for taking life and entering into adulterous affairs, while yearning to keep his family together, is not as important as the need to preach. Mr. Beasley and possibly Miranda Richardson (as Toosie) seem to be quietly aware of the ruse. In the dark, but acting stellar, are surprisingly unsaved mechanic Walton Goggins (as Sam) and born-again best friend Billy Joe Shaver (as Joe). Billy Bob Thornton has a glorified cameo. Duval's characterization is excellent. ******* The Apostle (9/6/97) Robert Duvall ~ Robert Duvall, Farrah Fawcett, John Beasley, Walton Goggins

    "The Apostle" (1997) is a film that I've appreciated more as I've gotten older. Writer/director Robert Duvall had to make it independently because studios didn't want to touch the material. The story's a character study of a Southern Pentecostal preacher, Sonny (Duvall), whose wife wants to leave him due to his infidelities (Farrah Fawcett). She now has a relationship with the youth minister and they're taking over the mega-church in the Dallas suburbs. Sonny reacts foolishly and is forced into exile. He changes his name and goes into the backwaters of Louisiana to eventually start a rural church that attracts the poor. Wherever Sonny goes, he can't seem to part with his "calling" and "anointing" -- to lead people to the LORD and motivate believers. If you can't handle Pentecostalism and all that goes with it -- hyper praise & worship, charismatic gifts, evangelism and prayer -- I suggest staying far away from "The Apostle." I also suggest you stay away if you're not into seeing depictions of Southern poverty or nigh-poverty since large portions of the film take place in this environment. Duvall's idea was to do a modern take on the King David tragedy -- a man of God who falls into adultery and, then, possibly murder, albeit unintentional. Even so, Duvall stated in a 2010 interview that Sonny's sins aren't half as bad as David's since there's a huge difference between involuntary manslaughter and outright (indirect) murder. "The Apostle" is the greatest kind of character study because it evokes strong opinions and discussions. Is Sonny a genuine but seriously flawed minister or just a phony who doesn't know it? Put another way, can a Christian be a "man (or woman) after God's own heart" and still commit serious sins? Does Sonny legitimately repent or does he evade repentance? Is the theology presented in the film shallow or heavy? Is resorting to righteous anger or corporeal punishment sometimes appropriate for the New Testamen believer or should Christians always be lovey-dovey doormats? FINAL WORD: There's nothing like "The Apostle" in cinema. It's truly a unique film and it gets better with repeat viewings because a lot of what is conveyed is subtle and wordless. There's just the right amount of ambiguity that keeps the viewer guessing and the movie open to interpretation. GRADE: A

    This may actually be the worst movie I have ever seen - Buffalo Nickel is a close second. It is the story of a preacher who is just like the rest of his congregation. Now that is a revelation. Aren't all preachers human. He has his faith and his faults. Surprise, surprise. It seems to me anyone could go around yelling, singing and preaching like Duvall. The incessant preaching and bible thumping is truly very nerve racking. It could actually make a person prefer to go to hell. As an atheist it is disturbing to see so many religious people. As a critical thinker it is disappointing to realize how many people remain steeped in faith and fantasy rather that fact and reality. As a movie goer this movie is BORING!!!!!

    Sonny Dewey (Robert Duvall) is the charismatic preacher of a fundamentalist Texas church, until his short temper gets him in serious trouble. He runs off to Louisiana, becomes part of a small community, and starts a new church where he brings hope and salvation to his loyal followers. Robert Duvall is a powerhouse; he wrote, directed, produced, and starred in this movie - and it's wonderful. He is so convincing as the southern evangelist that it really surprised me to hear him speak in his normal voice in the Extras. Sonny is completely devoted to saving people and spreading the Word, but we suspect he may have a violent and unsavory past, and that dichotomy keeps our eyes glued to Duvall at all times. As Sonny, he's driven, tireless, and simply inspired. While Duvall gets excellent performances out of many local, non-actors in small parts, there were several casting choices that didn't seem right to me: Farrah Fawcett plays Sonny's wife and she's so recognizable as a former "Angel" and glamour girl that it was hard to buy her as a quiet, plain-Jane. June Carter Cash plays Sonny's mother although she is only two years older than Duvall - and looks it and that was distracting. And Billy Bob Thornton has a very small role as a troublemaker that was never developed; I kept expecting him to show up again and do something important and worthy of his stature. The term "tour de force" can certainly be applied to Duvall's performance; he is riveting, charismatic, and utterly believable. Interestingly, the story makes him neither a hero nor a villain; it is left up to the viewer to decide who exactly "the Apostle" is. Highly recommended.

    First: DuVall's performance and that of the other actors in this film were 100% on point. Hollywood's portrayal of Christianity is always done in a way that makes anyone who calls themselves a Christian look like dumb and/or wacko, the style of Christianity shown in this film would have been such a large target of this lopsided Hollywood viewpoint. BUT instead DuVall took great pains to portray these in a most realistic way. Without making fun or a mockery of this worship style. Second: The message in this story is that Christians are not perfect but forgiven. Some of you may not understand that, given the candy coated image of what a Christian is. We all hate to show our weakness and Christians have it even harder when they try to pretend that they have no faults. The truth is we all fail in our attempt to be what God ask of us. But the true Christian seeks to do God's will and to follow his teachings. When we fail we are sorrowful and ask for help and forgiveness. "Sonny" mirrors the biblical "King David". David was a "man after God's own heart", however David was far from perfect. He committed Adultery and killed the woman's husband to cover it up. He did many things that were not right but yet his heart was always to follow God. There are many people who try to follow God but are discouraged buy failure and unfortunately in many cases get no support from the church in helping them back on the right track. These people turn there backs on God and the church, most never to return. This is a good movie for Christians who are sometimes way to full of themselves to see what they have become. I know many "Christians" who have a hart for the appearance of Christian perfection but have no heart for doing what God ask of them. I can only pray that they see the difference before it is to late. For those of you who may not call yourselves Christian, Try to understand the heart of "Sonny". Despite some of his actions "Sonny" has a heart for God. Also understand that true Christianity is a relationship with God and not just a bunch of rules. When you truly love someone you want to do what pleases them. You may not always succeed but it is your number one desire. And this is what this movie is about.

    An excellent take on charismatic, evangelical Christianity. An imperfect man with faith. Why wouldn't exposure of his wife's adultery challenged her ability to take over the church? I never understood why did he go and start a new church when he was avoiding the murder charges. Why did Sonny attempt a relationship with the new lady in Louisiana? Wouldint his new woman be adultery since he yet to be formally divorced? He seems to have been aware of the inevitable. Was he on a mission of redemption before he face the inevitable punishment? Was he addicted to the prestige and sense of purpose he had as a minister? Why did he fight so hard to build the new church?

    Generally I place entertainment at the top of my list for enjoying a film. Although the acting by Robert Duvall is terrific, the movie fails as entertainment. Two plus hours of what seemed like one long church sermon is close to unbearable. Duvall's character is anything but sympathetic, considering his violent solutions, religious brain wiring of the gullible, and outrageous showmanship. He simply comes across as a religious huckster. I can truthfully say that for me, "The Apostle" was a huge disappointment. I'm sure that to the correct audience it will be vastly appealing. Not recommended here however. .............................. MERK

When you truly love someone you want to do what pleases them. You may not always succeed but it is your number one desire. And this is what this movie is about.

    An excellent take on charismatic, evangelical Christianity. An imperfect man with faith. Why wouldn't exposure of his wife's adultery challenged her ability to take over the church? I never understood why did he go and start a new church when he was avoiding the murder charges. Why did Sonny attempt a relationship with the new lady in Louisiana? Wouldint his new woman be adultery since he yet to be formally divorced? He seems to have been aware of the inevitable. Was he on a mission of redemption before he face the inevitable punishment? Was he addicted to the prestige and sense of purpose he had as a minister? Why did he fight so hard to build the new church?

    Generally I place entertainment at the top of my list for enjoying a film. Although the acting by Robert Duvall is terrific, the movie fails as entertainment. Two plus hours of what seemed like one long church sermon is close to unbearable. Duvall's character is anything but sympathetic, considering his violent solutions, religious brain wiring of the gullible, and outrageous showmanship. He simply comes across as a religious huckster. I can truthfully say that for me, "The Apostle" was a huge disappointment. I'm sure that to the correct audience it will be vastly appealing. Not recommended here however. .............................. MERK

    Many films have their hearts in the right place, but just can't close the deal. Now, this does have a great setup, and it takes you to an interesting place. At the same time, about half an hour could have been cut from the film. For the most part, while predictable the writing does well with its premise. I don't think I was ever surprised by anything. Duvall gives a great award-worthy performance, and his character has charisma. The film, however, falls too much in love with it, goes off on a tangent, and it is bound and determined not to end. The length of the climactic scene - if you can call it that - undermined the story's emotional impact. The film benefits from its cast, but Billy Bob Thornton and Miranda Richardson were the only supporting actors who added much depth to the plot. If you're looking for a similar Christian tale of redemption set in the Deep South, I would recommend Black Snake Moan. I found that one to have a better pace, more interesting characters, and tighter writing.

    i waited to see this movie. i guess i was afraid. i watched "the apostle" tonight! it gripped me from the first turn of the reels. i have always adored robert duvall! "convicts" is also one of his best roles! and, let us not forget "lonesome dove"! i could not believe the fact that he also directed this movie, as well. i know it was made back in 1997, but, i just saw it tonight. robert duvall-you are one of the finest actors to ever come out of the back woods of this great country of ours! the tragedy is you did not make more movies in which you were also given the chance to direct! i take my hat off to you, fine sir! hats off, gentlemen, to a genius!!

    This is one of those rare Performances that seems to transcend Acting. Robert Duvall is the Apostille, one might say. A firebrand force, a Jesus Juggernaut, a Preacher who will not be denied. He will invoke Jesus' Name until it literally drives Satan away holding his ears. The trouble, as far as this Movie goes, it may drive Viewers away with its relentless Bible Thumping and sing-song Religious Rants, most shouted at supreme volume, with or without the aid of a microphone or Amplitude Modulation. There is so much of this and it is so intense that it almost, but not quite, leaves the more subtle, sublime elements drowning in a Sea of self-indulgence. There is much to admire in this singular effort from the Producer/Writer/Star/Director. The backdrops all have a realism of Rural, Southern Americana and the Cast are all fitting and the combination of Pros and Extras add an almost Documentary feel. Much praise and much Screen time is given to Stylistic Sermonizing by the Apostille and although it is totally believable and compelling, there maybe just too much of a Good thing. Overall, this gallant effort is not without its Sins and is quite an Excellent Character Study. A bit of editing and just a little restraint may have made this a Masterpiece.

    After bringing scores of souls to accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, evangelical Texas preacher Robert Duvall (as Euless "Sonny" Dewey) finds his Christian career threatened by infidelity. Cheating wife Farrah Fawcett (as Jessie) wants a divorce. Enraged, Mr. Duvall takes a fatal swing at Ms. Fawcett's young lover Todd Allen (as Horace). On the run from the police, Duvall changes his identity to "Apostle E.F." and begins a new preaching career in partnership with retired Louisiana minister John Beasley (as Charles Blackwell). Success includes a radio show, which is eventually heard by... The opening scenes include Duvall as a boy, which may not be clear (unless you watch it a second time). The setting is 1969, and jumps ahead with no notification. There is also something odd about mother June Carter Cash, who possibly likes to play possum. Another early concern is that Duvall, who also wrote and directed, holds back on his character's own sexual indiscretions. These are referenced as "wanderin' eye" and "womanizing" in the script, but a concentrated attention is required. Consequently, Fawcett appears to be the wicked home-wrecker. She also wants to steal Duvall's congregation... Duvall's preacher is a violent, vociferous and self-centered liar. However, he does appear to be a genuine believer. Why he avoids accepting responsibility for taking life and entering into adulterous affairs, while yearning to keep his family together, is not as important as the need to preach. Mr. Beasley and possibly Miranda Richardson (as Toosie) seem to be quietly aware of the ruse. In the dark, but acting stellar, are surprisingly unsaved mechanic Walton Goggins (as Sam) and born-again best friend Billy Joe Shaver (as Joe). Billy Bob Thornton has a glorified cameo. Duval's characterization is excellent. ******* The Apostle (9/6/97) Robert Duvall ~ Robert Duvall, Farrah Fawcett, John Beasley, Walton Goggins

    "The Apostle" (1997) is a film that I've appreciated more as I've gotten older. Writer/director Robert Duvall had to make it independently because studios didn't want to touch the material. The story's a character study of a Southern Pentecostal preacher, Sonny (Duvall), whose wife wants to leave him due to his infidelities (Farrah Fawcett). She now has a relationship with the youth minister and they're taking over the mega-church in the Dallas suburbs. Sonny reacts foolishly and is forced into exile. He changes his name and goes into the backwaters of Louisiana to eventually start a rural church that attracts the poor. Wherever Sonny goes, he can't seem to part with his "calling" and "anointing" -- to lead people to the LORD and motivate believers. If you can't handle Pentecostalism and all that goes with it -- hyper praise & worship, charismatic gifts, evangelism and prayer -- I suggest staying far away from "The Apostle." I also suggest you stay away if you're not into seeing depictions of Southern poverty or nigh-poverty since large portions of the film take place in this environment. Duvall's idea was to do a modern take on the King David tragedy -- a man of God who falls into adultery and, then, possibly murder, albeit unintentional. Even so, Duvall stated in a 2010 interview that Sonny's sins aren't half as bad as David's since there's a huge difference between involuntary manslaughter and outright (indirect) murder. "The Apostle" is the greatest kind of character study because it evokes strong opinions and discussions. Is Sonny a genuine but seriously flawed minister or just a phony who doesn't know it? Put another way, can a Christian be a "man (or woman) after God's own heart" and still commit serious sins? Does Sonny legitimately repent or does he evade repentance? Is the theology presented in the film shallow or heavy? Is resorting to righteous anger or corporeal punishment sometimes appropriate for the New Testamen believer or should Christians always be lovey-dovey doormats? FINAL WORD: There's nothing like "The Apostle" in cinema. It's truly a unique film and it gets better with repeat viewings because a lot of what is conveyed is subtle and wordless. There's just the right amount of ambiguity that keeps the viewer guessing and the movie open to interpretation. GRADE: A

    This may actually be the worst movie I have ever seen - Buffalo Nickel is a close second. It is the story of a preacher who is just like the rest of his congregation. Now that is a revelation. Aren't all preachers human. He has his faith and his faults. Surprise, surprise. It seems to me anyone could go around yelling, singing and preaching like Duvall. The incessant preaching and bible thumping is truly very nerve racking. It could actually make a person prefer to go to hell. As an atheist it is disturbing to see so many religious people. As a critical thinker it is disappointing to realize how many people remain steeped in faith and fantasy rather that fact and reality. As a movie goer this movie is BORING!!!!!

    Sonny Dewey (Robert Duvall) is the charismatic preacher of a fundamentalist Texas church, until his short temper gets him in serious trouble. He runs off to Louisiana, becomes part of a small community, and starts a new church where he brings hope and salvation to his loyal followers. Robert Duvall is a powerhouse; he wrote, directed, produced, and starred in this movie - and it's wonderful. He is so convincing as the southern evangelist that it really surprised me to hear him speak in his normal voice in the Extras. Sonny is completely devoted to saving people and spreading the Word, but we suspect he may have a violent and unsavory past, and that dichotomy keeps our eyes glued to Duvall at all times. As Sonny, he's driven, tireless, and simply inspired. While Duvall gets excellent performances out of many local, non-actors in small parts, there were several casting choices that didn't seem right to me: Farrah Fawcett plays Sonny's wife and she's so recognizable as a former "Angel" and glamour girl that it was hard to buy her as a quiet, plain-Jane. June Carter Cash plays Sonny's mother although she is only two years older than Duvall - and looks it and that was distracting. And Billy Bob Thornton has a very small role as a troublemaker that was never developed; I kept expecting him to show up again and do something important and worthy of his stature. The term "tour de force" can certainly be applied to Duvall's performance; he is riveting, charismatic, and utterly believable. Interestingly, the story makes him neither a hero nor a villain; it is left up to the viewer to decide who exactly "the Apostle" is. Highly recommended.

    First: DuVall's performance and that of the other actors in this film were 100% on point. Hollywood's portrayal of Christianity is always done in a way that makes anyone who calls themselves a Christian look like dumb and/or wacko, the style of Christianity shown in this film would have been such a large target of this lopsided Hollywood viewpoint. BUT instead DuVall took great pains to portray these in a most realistic way. Without making fun or a mockery of this worship style. Second: The message in this story is that Christians are not perfect but forgiven. Some of you may not understand that, given the candy coated image of what a Christian is. We all hate to show our weakness and Christians have it even harder when they try to pretend that they have no faults. The truth is we all fail in our attempt to be what God ask of us. But the true Christian seeks to do God's will and to follow his teachings. When we fail we are sorrowful and ask for help and forgiveness. "Sonny" mirrors the biblical "King David". David was a "man after God's own heart", however David was far from perfect. He committed Adultery and killed the woman's husband to cover it up. He did many things that were not right but yet his heart was always to follow God. There are many people who try to follow God but are discouraged buy failure and unfortunately in many cases get no support from the church in helping them back on the right track. These people turn there backs on God and the church, most never to return. This is a good movie for Christians who are sometimes way to full of themselves to see what they have become. I know many "Christians" who have a hart for the appearance of Christian perfection but have no heart for doing what God ask of them. I can only pray that they see the difference before it is to late. For those of you who may not call yourselves Christian, Try to understand the heart of "Sonny". Despite some of his actions "Sonny" has a heart for God. Also understand that true Christianity is a relationship with God and not just a bunch of rules.

I can only pray that they see the difference before it is to late. For those of you who may not call yourselves Christian, Try to understand the heart of "Sonny". Despite some of his actions "Sonny" has a heart for God. Also understand that true Christianity is a relationship with God and not just a bunch of rules. When you truly love someone you want to do what pleases them. You may not always succeed but it is your number one desire. And this is what this movie is about.

    An excellent take on charismatic, evangelical Christianity. An imperfect man with faith. Why wouldn't exposure of his wife's adultery challenged her ability to take over the church? I never understood why did he go and start a new church when he was avoiding the murder charges. Why did Sonny attempt a relationship with the new lady in Louisiana? Wouldint his new woman be adultery since he yet to be formally divorced? He seems to have been aware of the inevitable. Was he on a mission of redemption before he face the inevitable punishment? Was he addicted to the prestige and sense of purpose he had as a minister? Why did he fight so hard to build the new church?

    Generally I place entertainment at the top of my list for enjoying a film. Although the acting by Robert Duvall is terrific, the movie fails as entertainment. Two plus hours of what seemed like one long church sermon is close to unbearable. Duvall's character is anything but sympathetic, considering his violent solutions, religious brain wiring of the gullible, and outrageous showmanship. He simply comes across as a religious huckster. I can truthfully say that for me, "The Apostle" was a huge disappointment. I'm sure that to the correct audience it will be vastly appealing. Not recommended here however. .............................. MERK

    Many films have their hearts in the right place, but just can't close the deal. Now, this does have a great setup, and it takes you to an interesting place. At the same time, about half an hour could have been cut from the film. For the most part, while predictable the writing does well with its premise. I don't think I was ever surprised by anything. Duvall gives a great award-worthy performance, and his character has charisma. The film, however, falls too much in love with it, goes off on a tangent, and it is bound and determined not to end. The length of the climactic scene - if you can call it that - undermined the story's emotional impact. The film benefits from its cast, but Billy Bob Thornton and Miranda Richardson were the only supporting actors who added much depth to the plot. If you're looking for a similar Christian tale of redemption set in the Deep South, I would recommend Black Snake Moan. I found that one to have a better pace, more interesting characters, and tighter writing.

    i waited to see this movie. i guess i was afraid. i watched "the apostle" tonight! it gripped me from the first turn of the reels. i have always adored robert duvall! "convicts" is also one of his best roles! and, let us not forget "lonesome dove"! i could not believe the fact that he also directed this movie, as well. i know it was made back in 1997, but, i just saw it tonight. robert duvall-you are one of the finest actors to ever come out of the back woods of this great country of ours! the tragedy is you did not make more movies in which you were also given the chance to direct! i take my hat off to you, fine sir! hats off, gentlemen, to a genius!!

    This is one of those rare Performances that seems to transcend Acting. Robert Duvall is the Apostille, one might say. A firebrand force, a Jesus Juggernaut, a Preacher who will not be denied. He will invoke Jesus' Name until it literally drives Satan away holding his ears. The trouble, as far as this Movie goes, it may drive Viewers away with its relentless Bible Thumping and sing-song Religious Rants, most shouted at supreme volume, with or without the aid of a microphone or Amplitude Modulation. There is so much of this and it is so intense that it almost, but not quite, leaves the more subtle, sublime elements drowning in a Sea of self-indulgence. There is much to admire in this singular effort from the Producer/Writer/Star/Director. The backdrops all have a realism of Rural, Southern Americana and the Cast are all fitting and the combination of Pros and Extras add an almost Documentary feel. Much praise and much Screen time is given to Stylistic Sermonizing by the Apostille and although it is totally believable and compelling, there maybe just too much of a Good thing. Overall, this gallant effort is not without its Sins and is quite an Excellent Character Study. A bit of editing and just a little restraint may have made this a Masterpiece.

    After bringing scores of souls to accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, evangelical Texas preacher Robert Duvall (as Euless "Sonny" Dewey) finds his Christian career threatened by infidelity. Cheating wife Farrah Fawcett (as Jessie) wants a divorce. Enraged, Mr. Duvall takes a fatal swing at Ms. Fawcett's young lover Todd Allen (as Horace). On the run from the police, Duvall changes his identity to "Apostle E.F." and begins a new preaching career in partnership with retired Louisiana minister John Beasley (as Charles Blackwell). Success includes a radio show, which is eventually heard by... The opening scenes include Duvall as a boy, which may not be clear (unless you watch it a second time). The setting is 1969, and jumps ahead with no notification. There is also something odd about mother June Carter Cash, who possibly likes to play possum. Another early concern is that Duvall, who also wrote and directed, holds back on his character's own sexual indiscretions. These are referenced as "wanderin' eye" and "womanizing" in the script, but a concentrated attention is required. Consequently, Fawcett appears to be the wicked home-wrecker. She also wants to steal Duvall's congregation... Duvall's preacher is a violent, vociferous and self-centered liar. However, he does appear to be a genuine believer. Why he avoids accepting responsibility for taking life and entering into adulterous affairs, while yearning to keep his family together, is not as important as the need to preach. Mr. Beasley and possibly Miranda Richardson (as Toosie) seem to be quietly aware of the ruse. In the dark, but acting stellar, are surprisingly unsaved mechanic Walton Goggins (as Sam) and born-again best friend Billy Joe Shaver (as Joe). Billy Bob Thornton has a glorified cameo. Duval's characterization is excellent. ******* The Apostle (9/6/97) Robert Duvall ~ Robert Duvall, Farrah Fawcett, John Beasley, Walton Goggins

    "The Apostle" (1997) is a film that I've appreciated more as I've gotten older. Writer/director Robert Duvall had to make it independently because studios didn't want to touch the material. The story's a character study of a Southern Pentecostal preacher, Sonny (Duvall), whose wife wants to leave him due to his infidelities (Farrah Fawcett). She now has a relationship with the youth minister and they're taking over the mega-church in the Dallas suburbs. Sonny reacts foolishly and is forced into exile. He changes his name and goes into the backwaters of Louisiana to eventually start a rural church that attracts the poor. Wherever Sonny goes, he can't seem to part with his "calling" and "anointing" -- to lead people to the LORD and motivate believers. If you can't handle Pentecostalism and all that goes with it -- hyper praise & worship, charismatic gifts, evangelism and prayer -- I suggest staying far away from "The Apostle." I also suggest you stay away if you're not into seeing depictions of Southern poverty or nigh-poverty since large portions of the film take place in this environment. Duvall's idea was to do a modern take on the King David tragedy -- a man of God who falls into adultery and, then, possibly murder, albeit unintentional. Even so, Duvall stated in a 2010 interview that Sonny's sins aren't half as bad as David's since there's a huge difference between involuntary manslaughter and outright (indirect) murder. "The Apostle" is the greatest kind of character study because it evokes strong opinions and discussions. Is Sonny a genuine but seriously flawed minister or just a phony who doesn't know it? Put another way, can a Christian be a "man (or woman) after God's own heart" and still commit serious sins? Does Sonny legitimately repent or does he evade repentance? Is the theology presented in the film shallow or heavy? Is resorting to righteous anger or corporeal punishment sometimes appropriate for the New Testamen believer or should Christians always be lovey-dovey doormats? FINAL WORD: There's nothing like "The Apostle" in cinema. It's truly a unique film and it gets better with repeat viewings because a lot of what is conveyed is subtle and wordless. There's just the right amount of ambiguity that keeps the viewer guessing and the movie open to interpretation. GRADE: A

    This may actually be the worst movie I have ever seen - Buffalo Nickel is a close second. It is the story of a preacher who is just like the rest of his congregation. Now that is a revelation. Aren't all preachers human. He has his faith and his faults. Surprise, surprise. It seems to me anyone could go around yelling, singing and preaching like Duvall. The incessant preaching and bible thumping is truly very nerve racking. It could actually make a person prefer to go to hell. As an atheist it is disturbing to see so many religious people. As a critical thinker it is disappointing to realize how many people remain steeped in faith and fantasy rather that fact and reality. As a movie goer this movie is BORING!!!!!

    Sonny Dewey (Robert Duvall) is the charismatic preacher of a fundamentalist Texas church, until his short temper gets him in serious trouble. He runs off to Louisiana, becomes part of a small community, and starts a new church where he brings hope and salvation to his loyal followers. Robert Duvall is a powerhouse; he wrote, directed, produced, and starred in this movie - and it's wonderful. He is so convincing as the southern evangelist that it really surprised me to hear him speak in his normal voice in the Extras. Sonny is completely devoted to saving people and spreading the Word, but we suspect he may have a violent and unsavory past, and that dichotomy keeps our eyes glued to Duvall at all times. As Sonny, he's driven, tireless, and simply inspired. While Duvall gets excellent performances out of many local, non-actors in small parts, there were several casting choices that didn't seem right to me: Farrah Fawcett plays Sonny's wife and she's so recognizable as a former "Angel" and glamour girl that it was hard to buy her as a quiet, plain-Jane. June Carter Cash plays Sonny's mother although she is only two years older than Duvall - and looks it and that was distracting. And Billy Bob Thornton has a very small role as a troublemaker that was never developed; I kept expecting him to show up again and do something important and worthy of his stature. The term "tour de force" can certainly be applied to Duvall's performance; he is riveting, charismatic, and utterly believable. Interestingly, the story makes him neither a hero nor a villain; it is left up to the viewer to decide who exactly "the Apostle" is. Highly recommended.

    First: DuVall's performance and that of the other actors in this film were 100% on point. Hollywood's portrayal of Christianity is always done in a way that makes anyone who calls themselves a Christian look like dumb and/or wacko, the style of Christianity shown in this film would have been such a large target of this lopsided Hollywood viewpoint. BUT instead DuVall took great pains to portray these in a most realistic way. Without making fun or a mockery of this worship style. Second: The message in this story is that Christians are not perfect but forgiven. Some of you may not understand that, given the candy coated image of what a Christian is. We all hate to show our weakness and Christians have it even harder when they try to pretend that they have no faults. The truth is we all fail in our attempt to be what God ask of us. But the true Christian seeks to do God's will and to follow his teachings. When we fail we are sorrowful and ask for help and forgiveness. "Sonny" mirrors the biblical "King David". David was a "man after God's own heart", however David was far from perfect. He committed Adultery and killed the woman's husband to cover it up. He did many things that were not right but yet his heart was always to follow God. There are many people who try to follow God but are discouraged buy failure and unfortunately in many cases get no support from the church in helping them back on the right track. These people turn there backs on God and the church, most never to return. This is a good movie for Christians who are sometimes way to full of themselves to see what they have become. I know many "Christians" who have a hart for the appearance of Christian perfection but have no heart for doing what God ask of them. I can only pray that they see the difference before it is to late. For those of you who may not call yourselves Christian, Try to understand the heart of "Sonny".

These people turn there backs on God and the church, most never to return. This is a good movie for Christians who are sometimes way to full of themselves to see what they have become. I know many "Christians" who have a hart for the appearance of Christian perfection but have no heart for doing what God ask of them. I can only pray that they see the difference before it is to late. For those of you who may not call yourselves Christian, Try to understand the heart of "Sonny". Despite some of his actions "Sonny" has a heart for God. Also understand that true Christianity is a relationship with God and not just a bunch of rules. When you truly love someone you want to do what pleases them. You may not always succeed but it is your number one desire. And this is what this movie is about.

    An excellent take on charismatic, evangelical Christianity. An imperfect man with faith. Why wouldn't exposure of his wife's adultery challenged her ability to take over the church? I never understood why did he go and start a new church when he was avoiding the murder charges. Why did Sonny attempt a relationship with the new lady in Louisiana? Wouldint his new woman be adultery since he yet to be formally divorced? He seems to have been aware of the inevitable. Was he on a mission of redemption before he face the inevitable punishment? Was he addicted to the prestige and sense of purpose he had as a minister? Why did he fight so hard to build the new church?

    Generally I place entertainment at the top of my list for enjoying a film. Although the acting by Robert Duvall is terrific, the movie fails as entertainment. Two plus hours of what seemed like one long church sermon is close to unbearable. Duvall's character is anything but sympathetic, considering his violent solutions, religious brain wiring of the gullible, and outrageous showmanship. He simply comes across as a religious huckster. I can truthfully say that for me, "The Apostle" was a huge disappointment. I'm sure that to the correct audience it will be vastly appealing. Not recommended here however. .............................. MERK

    Many films have their hearts in the right place, but just can't close the deal. Now, this does have a great setup, and it takes you to an interesting place. At the same time, about half an hour could have been cut from the film. For the most part, while predictable the writing does well with its premise. I don't think I was ever surprised by anything. Duvall gives a great award-worthy performance, and his character has charisma. The film, however, falls too much in love with it, goes off on a tangent, and it is bound and determined not to end. The length of the climactic scene - if you can call it that - undermined the story's emotional impact. The film benefits from its cast, but Billy Bob Thornton and Miranda Richardson were the only supporting actors who added much depth to the plot. If you're looking for a similar Christian tale of redemption set in the Deep South, I would recommend Black Snake Moan. I found that one to have a better pace, more interesting characters, and tighter writing.

    i waited to see this movie. i guess i was afraid. i watched "the apostle" tonight! it gripped me from the first turn of the reels. i have always adored robert duvall! "convicts" is also one of his best roles! and, let us not forget "lonesome dove"! i could not believe the fact that he also directed this movie, as well. i know it was made back in 1997, but, i just saw it tonight. robert duvall-you are one of the finest actors to ever come out of the back woods of this great country of ours! the tragedy is you did not make more movies in which you were also given the chance to direct! i take my hat off to you, fine sir! hats off, gentlemen, to a genius!!

    This is one of those rare Performances that seems to transcend Acting. Robert Duvall is the Apostille, one might say. A firebrand force, a Jesus Juggernaut, a Preacher who will not be denied. He will invoke Jesus' Name until it literally drives Satan away holding his ears. The trouble, as far as this Movie goes, it may drive Viewers away with its relentless Bible Thumping and sing-song Religious Rants, most shouted at supreme volume, with or without the aid of a microphone or Amplitude Modulation. There is so much of this and it is so intense that it almost, but not quite, leaves the more subtle, sublime elements drowning in a Sea of self-indulgence. There is much to admire in this singular effort from the Producer/Writer/Star/Director. The backdrops all have a realism of Rural, Southern Americana and the Cast are all fitting and the combination of Pros and Extras add an almost Documentary feel. Much praise and much Screen time is given to Stylistic Sermonizing by the Apostille and although it is totally believable and compelling, there maybe just too much of a Good thing. Overall, this gallant effort is not without its Sins and is quite an Excellent Character Study. A bit of editing and just a little restraint may have made this a Masterpiece.

    After bringing scores of souls to accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, evangelical Texas preacher Robert Duvall (as Euless "Sonny" Dewey) finds his Christian career threatened by infidelity. Cheating wife Farrah Fawcett (as Jessie) wants a divorce. Enraged, Mr. Duvall takes a fatal swing at Ms. Fawcett's young lover Todd Allen (as Horace). On the run from the police, Duvall changes his identity to "Apostle E.F." and begins a new preaching career in partnership with retired Louisiana minister John Beasley (as Charles Blackwell). Success includes a radio show, which is eventually heard by... The opening scenes include Duvall as a boy, which may not be clear (unless you watch it a second time). The setting is 1969, and jumps ahead with no notification. There is also something odd about mother June Carter Cash, who possibly likes to play possum. Another early concern is that Duvall, who also wrote and directed, holds back on his character's own sexual indiscretions. These are referenced as "wanderin' eye" and "womanizing" in the script, but a concentrated attention is required. Consequently, Fawcett appears to be the wicked home-wrecker. She also wants to steal Duvall's congregation... Duvall's preacher is a violent, vociferous and self-centered liar. However, he does appear to be a genuine believer. Why he avoids accepting responsibility for taking life and entering into adulterous affairs, while yearning to keep his family together, is not as important as the need to preach. Mr. Beasley and possibly Miranda Richardson (as Toosie) seem to be quietly aware of the ruse. In the dark, but acting stellar, are surprisingly unsaved mechanic Walton Goggins (as Sam) and born-again best friend Billy Joe Shaver (as Joe). Billy Bob Thornton has a glorified cameo. Duval's characterization is excellent. ******* The Apostle (9/6/97) Robert Duvall ~ Robert Duvall, Farrah Fawcett, John Beasley, Walton Goggins

    "The Apostle" (1997) is a film that I've appreciated more as I've gotten older. Writer/director Robert Duvall had to make it independently because studios didn't want to touch the material. The story's a character study of a Southern Pentecostal preacher, Sonny (Duvall), whose wife wants to leave him due to his infidelities (Farrah Fawcett). She now has a relationship with the youth minister and they're taking over the mega-church in the Dallas suburbs. Sonny reacts foolishly and is forced into exile. He changes his name and goes into the backwaters of Louisiana to eventually start a rural church that attracts the poor. Wherever Sonny goes, he can't seem to part with his "calling" and "anointing" -- to lead people to the LORD and motivate believers. If you can't handle Pentecostalism and all that goes with it -- hyper praise & worship, charismatic gifts, evangelism and prayer -- I suggest staying far away from "The Apostle." I also suggest you stay away if you're not into seeing depictions of Southern poverty or nigh-poverty since large portions of the film take place in this environment. Duvall's idea was to do a modern take on the King David tragedy -- a man of God who falls into adultery and, then, possibly murder, albeit unintentional. Even so, Duvall stated in a 2010 interview that Sonny's sins aren't half as bad as David's since there's a huge difference between involuntary manslaughter and outright (indirect) murder. "The Apostle" is the greatest kind of character study because it evokes strong opinions and discussions. Is Sonny a genuine but seriously flawed minister or just a phony who doesn't know it? Put another way, can a Christian be a "man (or woman) after God's own heart" and still commit serious sins? Does Sonny legitimately repent or does he evade repentance? Is the theology presented in the film shallow or heavy? Is resorting to righteous anger or corporeal punishment sometimes appropriate for the New Testamen believer or should Christians always be lovey-dovey doormats? FINAL WORD: There's nothing like "The Apostle" in cinema. It's truly a unique film and it gets better with repeat viewings because a lot of what is conveyed is subtle and wordless. There's just the right amount of ambiguity that keeps the viewer guessing and the movie open to interpretation. GRADE: A

    This may actually be the worst movie I have ever seen - Buffalo Nickel is a close second. It is the story of a preacher who is just like the rest of his congregation. Now that is a revelation. Aren't all preachers human. He has his faith and his faults. Surprise, surprise. It seems to me anyone could go around yelling, singing and preaching like Duvall. The incessant preaching and bible thumping is truly very nerve racking. It could actually make a person prefer to go to hell. As an atheist it is disturbing to see so many religious people. As a critical thinker it is disappointing to realize how many people remain steeped in faith and fantasy rather that fact and reality. As a movie goer this movie is BORING!!!!!

    Sonny Dewey (Robert Duvall) is the charismatic preacher of a fundamentalist Texas church, until his short temper gets him in serious trouble. He runs off to Louisiana, becomes part of a small community, and starts a new church where he brings hope and salvation to his loyal followers. Robert Duvall is a powerhouse; he wrote, directed, produced, and starred in this movie - and it's wonderful. He is so convincing as the southern evangelist that it really surprised me to hear him speak in his normal voice in the Extras. Sonny is completely devoted to saving people and spreading the Word, but we suspect he may have a violent and unsavory past, and that dichotomy keeps our eyes glued to Duvall at all times. As Sonny, he's driven, tireless, and simply inspired. While Duvall gets excellent performances out of many local, non-actors in small parts, there were several casting choices that didn't seem right to me: Farrah Fawcett plays Sonny's wife and she's so recognizable as a former "Angel" and glamour girl that it was hard to buy her as a quiet, plain-Jane. June Carter Cash plays Sonny's mother although she is only two years older than Duvall - and looks it and that was distracting. And Billy Bob Thornton has a very small role as a troublemaker that was never developed; I kept expecting him to show up again and do something important and worthy of his stature. The term "tour de force" can certainly be applied to Duvall's performance; he is riveting, charismatic, and utterly believable. Interestingly, the story makes him neither a hero nor a villain; it is left up to the viewer to decide who exactly "the Apostle" is. Highly recommended.

    First: DuVall's performance and that of the other actors in this film were 100% on point. Hollywood's portrayal of Christianity is always done in a way that makes anyone who calls themselves a Christian look like dumb and/or wacko, the style of Christianity shown in this film would have been such a large target of this lopsided Hollywood viewpoint. BUT instead DuVall took great pains to portray these in a most realistic way. Without making fun or a mockery of this worship style. Second: The message in this story is that Christians are not perfect but forgiven. Some of you may not understand that, given the candy coated image of what a Christian is. We all hate to show our weakness and Christians have it even harder when they try to pretend that they have no faults. The truth is we all fail in our attempt to be what God ask of us. But the true Christian seeks to do God's will and to follow his teachings. When we fail we are sorrowful and ask for help and forgiveness. "Sonny" mirrors the biblical "King David". David was a "man after God's own heart", however David was far from perfect. He committed Adultery and killed the woman's husband to cover it up. He did many things that were not right but yet his heart was always to follow God. There are many people who try to follow God but are discouraged buy failure and unfortunately in many cases get no support from the church in helping them back on the right track. These people turn there backs on God and the church, most never to return. This is a good movie for Christians who are sometimes way to full of themselves to see what they have become.

There are many people who try to follow God but are discouraged buy failure and unfortunately in many cases get no support from the church in helping them back on the right track. These people turn there backs on God and the church, most never to return. This is a good movie for Christians who are sometimes way to full of themselves to see what they have become. I know many "Christians" who have a hart for the appearance of Christian perfection but have no heart for doing what God ask of them. I can only pray that they see the difference before it is to late. For those of you who may not call yourselves Christian, Try to understand the heart of "Sonny". Despite some of his actions "Sonny" has a heart for God. Also understand that true Christianity is a relationship with God and not just a bunch of rules. When you truly love someone you want to do what pleases them. You may not always succeed but it is your number one desire. And this is what this movie is about.

    An excellent take on charismatic, evangelical Christianity. An imperfect man with faith. Why wouldn't exposure of his wife's adultery challenged her ability to take over the church? I never understood why did he go and start a new church when he was avoiding the murder charges. Why did Sonny attempt a relationship with the new lady in Louisiana? Wouldint his new woman be adultery since he yet to be formally divorced? He seems to have been aware of the inevitable. Was he on a mission of redemption before he face the inevitable punishment? Was he addicted to the prestige and sense of purpose he had as a minister? Why did he fight so hard to build the new church?

    Generally I place entertainment at the top of my list for enjoying a film. Although the acting by Robert Duvall is terrific, the movie fails as entertainment. Two plus hours of what seemed like one long church sermon is close to unbearable. Duvall's character is anything but sympathetic, considering his violent solutions, religious brain wiring of the gullible, and outrageous showmanship. He simply comes across as a religious huckster. I can truthfully say that for me, "The Apostle" was a huge disappointment. I'm sure that to the correct audience it will be vastly appealing. Not recommended here however. .............................. MERK

    Many films have their hearts in the right place, but just can't close the deal. Now, this does have a great setup, and it takes you to an interesting place. At the same time, about half an hour could have been cut from the film. For the most part, while predictable the writing does well with its premise. I don't think I was ever surprised by anything. Duvall gives a great award-worthy performance, and his character has charisma. The film, however, falls too much in love with it, goes off on a tangent, and it is bound and determined not to end. The length of the climactic scene - if you can call it that - undermined the story's emotional impact. The film benefits from its cast, but Billy Bob Thornton and Miranda Richardson were the only supporting actors who added much depth to the plot. If you're looking for a similar Christian tale of redemption set in the Deep South, I would recommend Black Snake Moan. I found that one to have a better pace, more interesting characters, and tighter writing.

    i waited to see this movie. i guess i was afraid. i watched "the apostle" tonight! it gripped me from the first turn of the reels. i have always adored robert duvall! "convicts" is also one of his best roles! and, let us not forget "lonesome dove"! i could not believe the fact that he also directed this movie, as well. i know it was made back in 1997, but, i just saw it tonight. robert duvall-you are one of the finest actors to ever come out of the back woods of this great country of ours! the tragedy is you did not make more movies in which you were also given the chance to direct! i take my hat off to you, fine sir! hats off, gentlemen, to a genius!!

    This is one of those rare Performances that seems to transcend Acting. Robert Duvall is the Apostille, one might say. A firebrand force, a Jesus Juggernaut, a Preacher who will not be denied. He will invoke Jesus' Name until it literally drives Satan away holding his ears. The trouble, as far as this Movie goes, it may drive Viewers away with its relentless Bible Thumping and sing-song Religious Rants, most shouted at supreme volume, with or without the aid of a microphone or Amplitude Modulation. There is so much of this and it is so intense that it almost, but not quite, leaves the more subtle, sublime elements drowning in a Sea of self-indulgence. There is much to admire in this singular effort from the Producer/Writer/Star/Director. The backdrops all have a realism of Rural, Southern Americana and the Cast are all fitting and the combination of Pros and Extras add an almost Documentary feel. Much praise and much Screen time is given to Stylistic Sermonizing by the Apostille and although it is totally believable and compelling, there maybe just too much of a Good thing. Overall, this gallant effort is not without its Sins and is quite an Excellent Character Study. A bit of editing and just a little restraint may have made this a Masterpiece.

    After bringing scores of souls to accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, evangelical Texas preacher Robert Duvall (as Euless "Sonny" Dewey) finds his Christian career threatened by infidelity. Cheating wife Farrah Fawcett (as Jessie) wants a divorce. Enraged, Mr. Duvall takes a fatal swing at Ms. Fawcett's young lover Todd Allen (as Horace). On the run from the police, Duvall changes his identity to "Apostle E.F." and begins a new preaching career in partnership with retired Louisiana minister John Beasley (as Charles Blackwell). Success includes a radio show, which is eventually heard by... The opening scenes include Duvall as a boy, which may not be clear (unless you watch it a second time). The setting is 1969, and jumps ahead with no notification. There is also something odd about mother June Carter Cash, who possibly likes to play possum. Another early concern is that Duvall, who also wrote and directed, holds back on his character's own sexual indiscretions. These are referenced as "wanderin' eye" and "womanizing" in the script, but a concentrated attention is required. Consequently, Fawcett appears to be the wicked home-wrecker. She also wants to steal Duvall's congregation... Duvall's preacher is a violent, vociferous and self-centered liar. However, he does appear to be a genuine believer. Why he avoids accepting responsibility for taking life and entering into adulterous affairs, while yearning to keep his family together, is not as important as the need to preach. Mr. Beasley and possibly Miranda Richardson (as Toosie) seem to be quietly aware of the ruse. In the dark, but acting stellar, are surprisingly unsaved mechanic Walton Goggins (as Sam) and born-again best friend Billy Joe Shaver (as Joe). Billy Bob Thornton has a glorified cameo. Duval's characterization is excellent. ******* The Apostle (9/6/97) Robert Duvall ~ Robert Duvall, Farrah Fawcett, John Beasley, Walton Goggins

    "The Apostle" (1997) is a film that I've appreciated more as I've gotten older. Writer/director Robert Duvall had to make it independently because studios didn't want to touch the material. The story's a character study of a Southern Pentecostal preacher, Sonny (Duvall), whose wife wants to leave him due to his infidelities (Farrah Fawcett). She now has a relationship with the youth minister and they're taking over the mega-church in the Dallas suburbs. Sonny reacts foolishly and is forced into exile. He changes his name and goes into the backwaters of Louisiana to eventually start a rural church that attracts the poor. Wherever Sonny goes, he can't seem to part with his "calling" and "anointing" -- to lead people to the LORD and motivate believers. If you can't handle Pentecostalism and all that goes with it -- hyper praise & worship, charismatic gifts, evangelism and prayer -- I suggest staying far away from "The Apostle." I also suggest you stay away if you're not into seeing depictions of Southern poverty or nigh-poverty since large portions of the film take place in this environment. Duvall's idea was to do a modern take on the King David tragedy -- a man of God who falls into adultery and, then, possibly murder, albeit unintentional. Even so, Duvall stated in a 2010 interview that Sonny's sins aren't half as bad as David's since there's a huge difference between involuntary manslaughter and outright (indirect) murder. "The Apostle" is the greatest kind of character study because it evokes strong opinions and discussions. Is Sonny a genuine but seriously flawed minister or just a phony who doesn't know it? Put another way, can a Christian be a "man (or woman) after God's own heart" and still commit serious sins? Does Sonny legitimately repent or does he evade repentance? Is the theology presented in the film shallow or heavy? Is resorting to righteous anger or corporeal punishment sometimes appropriate for the New Testamen believer or should Christians always be lovey-dovey doormats? FINAL WORD: There's nothing like "The Apostle" in cinema. It's truly a unique film and it gets better with repeat viewings because a lot of what is conveyed is subtle and wordless. There's just the right amount of ambiguity that keeps the viewer guessing and the movie open to interpretation. GRADE: A

    This may actually be the worst movie I have ever seen - Buffalo Nickel is a close second. It is the story of a preacher who is just like the rest of his congregation. Now that is a revelation. Aren't all preachers human. He has his faith and his faults. Surprise, surprise. It seems to me anyone could go around yelling, singing and preaching like Duvall. The incessant preaching and bible thumping is truly very nerve racking. It could actually make a person prefer to go to hell. As an atheist it is disturbing to see so many religious people. As a critical thinker it is disappointing to realize how many people remain steeped in faith and fantasy rather that fact and reality. As a movie goer this movie is BORING!!!!!

    Sonny Dewey (Robert Duvall) is the charismatic preacher of a fundamentalist Texas church, until his short temper gets him in serious trouble. He runs off to Louisiana, becomes part of a small community, and starts a new church where he brings hope and salvation to his loyal followers. Robert Duvall is a powerhouse; he wrote, directed, produced, and starred in this movie - and it's wonderful. He is so convincing as the southern evangelist that it really surprised me to hear him speak in his normal voice in the Extras. Sonny is completely devoted to saving people and spreading the Word, but we suspect he may have a violent and unsavory past, and that dichotomy keeps our eyes glued to Duvall at all times. As Sonny, he's driven, tireless, and simply inspired. While Duvall gets excellent performances out of many local, non-actors in small parts, there were several casting choices that didn't seem right to me: Farrah Fawcett plays Sonny's wife and she's so recognizable as a former "Angel" and glamour girl that it was hard to buy her as a quiet, plain-Jane. June Carter Cash plays Sonny's mother although she is only two years older than Duvall - and looks it and that was distracting. And Billy Bob Thornton has a very small role as a troublemaker that was never developed; I kept expecting him to show up again and do something important and worthy of his stature. The term "tour de force" can certainly be applied to Duvall's performance; he is riveting, charismatic, and utterly believable. Interestingly, the story makes him neither a hero nor a villain; it is left up to the viewer to decide who exactly "the Apostle" is. Highly recommended.

    First: DuVall's performance and that of the other actors in this film were 100% on point. Hollywood's portrayal of Christianity is always done in a way that makes anyone who calls themselves a Christian look like dumb and/or wacko, the style of Christianity shown in this film would have been such a large target of this lopsided Hollywood viewpoint. BUT instead DuVall took great pains to portray these in a most realistic way. Without making fun or a mockery of this worship style. Second: The message in this story is that Christians are not perfect but forgiven. Some of you may not understand that, given the candy coated image of what a Christian is. We all hate to show our weakness and Christians have it even harder when they try to pretend that they have no faults. The truth is we all fail in our attempt to be what God ask of us. But the true Christian seeks to do God's will and to follow his teachings. When we fail we are sorrowful and ask for help and forgiveness. "Sonny" mirrors the biblical "King David". David was a "man after God's own heart", however David was far from perfect. He committed Adultery and killed the woman's husband to cover it up. He did many things that were not right but yet his heart was always to follow God.

David was a "man after God's own heart", however David was far from perfect. He committed Adultery and killed the woman's husband to cover it up. He did many things that were not right but yet his heart was always to follow God. There are many people who try to follow God but are discouraged buy failure and unfortunately in many cases get no support from the church in helping them back on the right track. These people turn there backs on God and the church, most never to return. This is a good movie for Christians who are sometimes way to full of themselves to see what they have become. I know many "Christians" who have a hart for the appearance of Christian perfection but have no heart for doing what God ask of them. I can only pray that they see the difference before it is to late. For those of you who may not call yourselves Christian, Try to understand the heart of "Sonny". Despite some of his actions "Sonny" has a heart for God. Also understand that true Christianity is a relationship with God and not just a bunch of rules. When you truly love someone you want to do what pleases them. You may not always succeed but it is your number one desire. And this is what this movie is about.

    An excellent take on charismatic, evangelical Christianity. An imperfect man with faith. Why wouldn't exposure of his wife's adultery challenged her ability to take over the church? I never understood why did he go and start a new church when he was avoiding the murder charges. Why did Sonny attempt a relationship with the new lady in Louisiana? Wouldint his new woman be adultery since he yet to be formally divorced? He seems to have been aware of the inevitable. Was he on a mission of redemption before he face the inevitable punishment? Was he addicted to the prestige and sense of purpose he had as a minister? Why did he fight so hard to build the new church?

    Generally I place entertainment at the top of my list for enjoying a film. Although the acting by Robert Duvall is terrific, the movie fails as entertainment. Two plus hours of what seemed like one long church sermon is close to unbearable. Duvall's character is anything but sympathetic, considering his violent solutions, religious brain wiring of the gullible, and outrageous showmanship. He simply comes across as a religious huckster. I can truthfully say that for me, "The Apostle" was a huge disappointment. I'm sure that to the correct audience it will be vastly appealing. Not recommended here however. .............................. MERK
