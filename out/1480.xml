 <sinopse>
  The living Volkswagen Beetle helps an old lady protect her home from a corrupt developer.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Alonzo Hawk is a mean-spirited property developer who has bought several blocks of land in the downtown district in order to build a gigantic shopping mall. There is one problem however; an elderly widow named Steinmetz won't sell the one remaining lot that Hawk needs to proceed with his scheme. So he resorts to all manner of chicanery, legal or otherwise, to get it. Fortunately, the widow Steinmetz has an ace up her sleeve in the form of Herbie, the miraculous Volkswagen.

    The first sequel to 'The Love Bug' is unfortunately charmless and meandering, as though the writers couldn't think of much to happen even with the limitless possibilities inherent in the premise of a sentient VW bug. No Dean Jones this time, so Herbie is now owned by little old lady Helen Hayes, who lives in the only house standing in the way of nasty property developer Keenan Wynn and his new project. When Wynn starts playing dirty, Herbie and friends fight back. In common with most Disney adventures of the '70s the visual effects are pathetic, and the editing is choppy as well, making for a very bumpy ride. There are pleasures here and there: the scene where Herbie drives through a hotel, Wynn's enjoyably irate performance, and a daft dream sequence in which Herbie imagines himself as King Kong, fighting off miniature versions of himself!

    The much-loved original is still hailed as one of the better live-action Disney films so I'm wondering why it took them a comparatively long time to throw out a sequel. However, it would appear that despite the long gestation that someone forgot to include pretty much anything that made "The Love Bug" such a smash. That's not to say that this is entirely worthless but it is a disappointment when you consider it next to its older brother. Property developer Alonzo Hawk (Keenan Wynn) is preparing to construct a huge tower overlooking San Fransisco but his diggers are kept back by the last remaining resident still on the plot. Mrs Steinmetz (Helen Hayes) lives in an old fire station with Nicole Harris (Stephanie Powers) and they vigorously fight against Hawk and his team of crooked lawyers trying to get them out of the way. But when Hawks hoodwinks his naive nephew Willoughby Whitfield (Ken Berry) into trying to get Mrs Steinmetz to move, he hadn't reckoned on the heart and soul of Herbie - the infamous Volkswagen Beetle with a mind of its own - getting in the way as well. In "The Love Bug", Herbie was a racer with numerous tricks up his sleeve but in "Herbie Rides Again", he's now some crime-fighting vigilante on four wheels. The stuff he gets up to - driving up sheer cliff faces or climbing the Golden Gate Bridge - never feels believable and as a result, the car loses some of its charm and personality in the process. Notice how in the poster, they've given Herbie eyes instead of headlights. The other thing that weakens the film is that Powers, Berry and Hayes are simply not as interesting as the stars of the first film - in fact, the funniest and most entertaining person is actually the baddie. Wynn has the best lines and scenes - the dream sequence he has is probably the highlight of the film - but what's the point if you're supposed to root for the others? It feels wrong to criticise such a kiddie friendly movie but I'm afraid "Herbie Rides Again" simply isn't as good as its predecessor. It's sillier and not as funny, littered with laboured performances from the protagonists and completely at odds with the story that went before it. The first film didn't rely on model shots or crude blue-screen effects and it was much more enjoyable. I realise that there might not have been much mileage in a car that thinks for itself plot wise but by turning Herbie into a crusader for the little people in the face of corporate greed, it made what was always slightly silly completely ridiculous. Stick with "The Love Bug" instead of this stalling sequel because it's more fun, more enjoyable and didn't feel like it lasted an age - I cannot recall 88 minutes feeling like such a long time.

    Well, that's really all that matters, isn't it. My 3 yr old over here in Norway in 2011 is a Herbie devotee - there were a bunch of Herbies ... under irrelevant Norwegian titles ... on sale in a supermarket bin - and he loves all 4 of the theater films. And I like the characters of this one, especially Ken Berry's. He comes to Uncle Alonzo wanting to believe in him and join him and then has his eyes opened, while falling in love with Mrs. Steinmetz's granddaughter - Tennessee's daughter?? Look at the expressions on Berry's face. WELL done. And Stephanie Powers' violent young woman is in another of the series: Julie Sommers in Herbie goes to Monte Carlo, for example. PMS, anyone? :-) When he wants to see this one, my little Rohan says he wants to see "Uncle" (Alonzo).

    Years ago, I saw Herbie Rides Again at a drive-in with my parents and recently I saw the movie for the first time in years when it aired on TCM. After more than 35 years from its original release, Herbie Rides Agam is a solid sequel to The Love Bug. The cast was outstanding, including Keenan Wynn reprising his role as ruthless real estate baron Alonzo Hawk, Helen Hayes as Mrs. Steinmetz, Ken Berry as Hawks nephew Willoughby and Stefanie Powers as Nicole. But the real star of the show was Herbie, the Volkswagen. No. 53 was back in action in his help to save Mrs. Steinmetz's firehouse from destruction by Hawk for a new skyscraper. The car with a mind of its own was aided by outstanding special effects. My favorite scene was near the end when Herbie and a fleet of Volkswagens teamed up to save the firehouse from being razed. I also liked the scenes of San Francisco, especially Fisherman's Wharf. Who would have thought that the movie's success would lead to two more sequels in the 70s and a recent update with Lindsey Lohan? Rev it up and rent it.

    Another of my favorite movies from childhood, I classify this movie as being as good as the original for a number of reasons. Lines, this movie has a lot of funny lines and good actors. I can still today go back and look at the film and laugh at some of the scenes and lines in this film. Another good thing in this film is footage. Herbie is literally everywhere in this film. Yes it gets a bit corny at times but its not so corny as to be unwatchable. The film has aged and it really does show its era, but that doesn't detract from it's enjoyability factor. This is a good family movie even if it does have a few scenes that boarder on pg.

    The looong opening sequence of buildings being demolished, followed by a looong sequence of a corporate meeting, should have clued me in that this entry would have little charm that was in the original. (Phantom Menace, anyone? Trade disputes are always so exciting.) I hadn't seen it since it first came out, and only recalled a few things from it. Whereas The Love Bug kicks things into gear from the get-go, this thing drags on interminably. Herbie shows little personality in this one, and is merely a vehicle for bad process-shot special effects. (Most of the ones in the original were done practically, i.e. live.) The original characters Jim and Tennessee are disposed of with throw-away lines. I find it hard to believe that Jim would "go off to Europe to race foreign cars" (and leave Herbie?) when it was practically the entire premise of The Love Bug that Herbie was just as good, and better, than any of them. It may be "good for kids" but a good movie can get adults to enjoy it just as much.

    From the racing circuit to the streets of San Francisco was the second stop on Walt Disney's Herbie odyssey. And the Magic Kingdom recruited an old villain from another some other films to be the fall guy in Herbie Rides Again. Our magical Volkswagen is now in the care of Mrs. Steinmetz played by Helen Hayes. As its explained Dean Jones has gone off to Europe to race and his mechanic Buddy Hackett got control of Herbie and he went off to Tibet, leaving Herbie in the hands of his aunt Helen Hayes. Helen Hayes and Buddy Hackett as blood relations is an interesting concept to wrap your mind around. Helen lives a quiet life in a converted old firehouse with Herbie guarding her. She needs guarding because Keenan Wynn who played Alonzo Hawk in the Absent Minded Professor and Son Of Flubber is after her property which stands in the way of him building the world's biggest 130 story skyscraper to uglify San Francisco's scenery. Wynn's the guy who on a tour of Rome looks at the Colosseum and decides it would make a great location for a shopping mall. Wynn sends his young nephew Ken Berry who still thinks his uncle is not a rat to negotiate thinking his naivet&eacute; will disarm Helen Hayes. It might disarm her, but there's no fooling the smartest car in the world. And definitely no fooling Hayes's granddaughter Stefanie Powers. But Berry smartens up and soon he's with Hayes, Powers, and Herbie. While Alonzo Hawk was a major character in the two Flubber films, in Herbie Rides Again, Keenan Wynn gets an opportunity to become one full blown ham and he makes the most of it. It's a pleasure to see him feasting on a diet of scenery. Watching him I couldn't help thinking was the same guy flummoxed by Fred MacMurray and Flubber. It seems when he's up against the supernatural, Alonzo Hawk just ain't at his best. Berry and Powers make a nice young couple and Hayes is given a bit of a romantic interest in visiting cattle rancher John McIntire who's in town on a toot and gets captivated by the whole Herbie mystique. Herbie Rides Again is a nice successor to the original and gives an opportunity for some of the best players around to strut their stuff.

    Prior to "The Love Bug", "Herbie Rides Again" is a high octane movie where our favorite VW Bug has an adventure of a different sort. This time around he takes on a greedy land developer named Alonzo Hawk(Keenan Wynn) who has a tough time trying to tear down a antique firehouse owned by a tough widow name Mrs. Steimetz(Helen Hayes). In order to give the land to him he gets his bumbling nephew, Wiloughby Whitfield (Ken Berry) to do his dirty work. When he discovers Hawk's scheme, he joins forces with Steinmetz and Nicole Harris(Stefanie Powers). Nicole is a tough willed woman to be reckoned with. All the scenes of this movie is magic. I liked the part where Hawk was dreaming and all the sheep in his dreams turned into Volkswagons with sharp teeth, and he acted like King Kong. The best part is where Herbie gathered all the VW Bugs against Hawk and his invaders. But Mr. Judson (John McIntire) helped some in saving the firehouse. Volkswagons were the bomb and they still are. If you like cars like that, this movie is for you! Knight Rider's got nothing on this one. 4.5 out of 5 stars!

Herbie shows little personality in this one, and is merely a vehicle for bad process-shot special effects. (Most of the ones in the original were done practically, i.e. live.) The original characters Jim and Tennessee are disposed of with throw-away lines. I find it hard to believe that Jim would "go off to Europe to race foreign cars" (and leave Herbie?) when it was practically the entire premise of The Love Bug that Herbie was just as good, and better, than any of them. It may be "good for kids" but a good movie can get adults to enjoy it just as much.

    From the racing circuit to the streets of San Francisco was the second stop on Walt Disney's Herbie odyssey. And the Magic Kingdom recruited an old villain from another some other films to be the fall guy in Herbie Rides Again. Our magical Volkswagen is now in the care of Mrs. Steinmetz played by Helen Hayes. As its explained Dean Jones has gone off to Europe to race and his mechanic Buddy Hackett got control of Herbie and he went off to Tibet, leaving Herbie in the hands of his aunt Helen Hayes. Helen Hayes and Buddy Hackett as blood relations is an interesting concept to wrap your mind around. Helen lives a quiet life in a converted old firehouse with Herbie guarding her. She needs guarding because Keenan Wynn who played Alonzo Hawk in the Absent Minded Professor and Son Of Flubber is after her property which stands in the way of him building the world's biggest 130 story skyscraper to uglify San Francisco's scenery. Wynn's the guy who on a tour of Rome looks at the Colosseum and decides it would make a great location for a shopping mall. Wynn sends his young nephew Ken Berry who still thinks his uncle is not a rat to negotiate thinking his naivet&eacute; will disarm Helen Hayes. It might disarm her, but there's no fooling the smartest car in the world. And definitely no fooling Hayes's granddaughter Stefanie Powers. But Berry smartens up and soon he's with Hayes, Powers, and Herbie. While Alonzo Hawk was a major character in the two Flubber films, in Herbie Rides Again, Keenan Wynn gets an opportunity to become one full blown ham and he makes the most of it. It's a pleasure to see him feasting on a diet of scenery. Watching him I couldn't help thinking was the same guy flummoxed by Fred MacMurray and Flubber. It seems when he's up against the supernatural, Alonzo Hawk just ain't at his best. Berry and Powers make a nice young couple and Hayes is given a bit of a romantic interest in visiting cattle rancher John McIntire who's in town on a toot and gets captivated by the whole Herbie mystique. Herbie Rides Again is a nice successor to the original and gives an opportunity for some of the best players around to strut their stuff.

    Prior to "The Love Bug", "Herbie Rides Again" is a high octane movie where our favorite VW Bug has an adventure of a different sort. This time around he takes on a greedy land developer named Alonzo Hawk(Keenan Wynn) who has a tough time trying to tear down a antique firehouse owned by a tough widow name Mrs. Steimetz(Helen Hayes). In order to give the land to him he gets his bumbling nephew, Wiloughby Whitfield (Ken Berry) to do his dirty work. When he discovers Hawk's scheme, he joins forces with Steinmetz and Nicole Harris(Stefanie Powers). Nicole is a tough willed woman to be reckoned with. All the scenes of this movie is magic. I liked the part where Hawk was dreaming and all the sheep in his dreams turned into Volkswagons with sharp teeth, and he acted like King Kong. The best part is where Herbie gathered all the VW Bugs against Hawk and his invaders. But Mr. Judson (John McIntire) helped some in saving the firehouse. Volkswagons were the bomb and they still are. If you like cars like that, this movie is for you! Knight Rider's got nothing on this one. 4.5 out of 5 stars!

    The first sequel to 'The Love Bug' is unfortunately charmless and meandering, as though the writers couldn't think of much to happen even with the limitless possibilities inherent in the premise of a sentient VW bug. No Dean Jones this time, so Herbie is now owned by little old lady Helen Hayes, who lives in the only house standing in the way of nasty property developer Keenan Wynn and his new project. When Wynn starts playing dirty, Herbie and friends fight back. In common with most Disney adventures of the '70s the visual effects are pathetic, and the editing is choppy as well, making for a very bumpy ride. There are pleasures here and there: the scene where Herbie drives through a hotel, Wynn's enjoyably irate performance, and a daft dream sequence in which Herbie imagines himself as King Kong, fighting off miniature versions of himself!

    The much-loved original is still hailed as one of the better live-action Disney films so I'm wondering why it took them a comparatively long time to throw out a sequel. However, it would appear that despite the long gestation that someone forgot to include pretty much anything that made "The Love Bug" such a smash. That's not to say that this is entirely worthless but it is a disappointment when you consider it next to its older brother. Property developer Alonzo Hawk (Keenan Wynn) is preparing to construct a huge tower overlooking San Fransisco but his diggers are kept back by the last remaining resident still on the plot. Mrs Steinmetz (Helen Hayes) lives in an old fire station with Nicole Harris (Stephanie Powers) and they vigorously fight against Hawk and his team of crooked lawyers trying to get them out of the way. But when Hawks hoodwinks his naive nephew Willoughby Whitfield (Ken Berry) into trying to get Mrs Steinmetz to move, he hadn't reckoned on the heart and soul of Herbie - the infamous Volkswagen Beetle with a mind of its own - getting in the way as well. In "The Love Bug", Herbie was a racer with numerous tricks up his sleeve but in "Herbie Rides Again", he's now some crime-fighting vigilante on four wheels. The stuff he gets up to - driving up sheer cliff faces or climbing the Golden Gate Bridge - never feels believable and as a result, the car loses some of its charm and personality in the process. Notice how in the poster, they've given Herbie eyes instead of headlights. The other thing that weakens the film is that Powers, Berry and Hayes are simply not as interesting as the stars of the first film - in fact, the funniest and most entertaining person is actually the baddie. Wynn has the best lines and scenes - the dream sequence he has is probably the highlight of the film - but what's the point if you're supposed to root for the others? It feels wrong to criticise such a kiddie friendly movie but I'm afraid "Herbie Rides Again" simply isn't as good as its predecessor. It's sillier and not as funny, littered with laboured performances from the protagonists and completely at odds with the story that went before it. The first film didn't rely on model shots or crude blue-screen effects and it was much more enjoyable. I realise that there might not have been much mileage in a car that thinks for itself plot wise but by turning Herbie into a crusader for the little people in the face of corporate greed, it made what was always slightly silly completely ridiculous. Stick with "The Love Bug" instead of this stalling sequel because it's more fun, more enjoyable and didn't feel like it lasted an age - I cannot recall 88 minutes feeling like such a long time.

    Well, that's really all that matters, isn't it. My 3 yr old over here in Norway in 2011 is a Herbie devotee - there were a bunch of Herbies ... under irrelevant Norwegian titles ... on sale in a supermarket bin - and he loves all 4 of the theater films. And I like the characters of this one, especially Ken Berry's. He comes to Uncle Alonzo wanting to believe in him and join him and then has his eyes opened, while falling in love with Mrs. Steinmetz's granddaughter - Tennessee's daughter?? Look at the expressions on Berry's face. WELL done. And Stephanie Powers' violent young woman is in another of the series: Julie Sommers in Herbie goes to Monte Carlo, for example. PMS, anyone? :-) When he wants to see this one, my little Rohan says he wants to see "Uncle" (Alonzo).

    Agreeable Disney's love bug Wolkswagen plenty of action , slapstick , laughs and fun . This comical Herbie story concerns about Alonzo Hawk (Keenan Wynn) who is an ambitious property developer who has bought lots of blocks of land in the Downstreet district in order to build a shopping mall and apartments . There is one obstacle however ; an old woman , firefighter's widow named Steinmetz ( Helen Hayes) who won't sell the one remaining lot that Hawk needs to carry out with his gigantic plot . So Hawk resorts to all manner of traps , legal or otherwise, to get it. Fortunately, the elderly widow Steinmetz has an ace under her sleeve in the form of Herbie , the fantastic car which she receives from her niece , as she takes a magical Wolkswagen Bug named Herbie with a mind of its own . Miraculous Herbie takes her for a ride and stumbles into Hawk's evil hoodlums who pursue through skyscrapers , bridges and buildings . As always, Herbie the love bug , is helping the young couple (Ken Barry , Stefanie Powers) find romance but encountering all sorts of hilarious obstacles along the way . Meanwhile Herbie with the number 53 dreams that intervenes in the biggest race cars located in Daytona to compete in the Grand Prize , a challenge among top competitors circle the world's most famous racing circuits and quickly slipping in the ranking. This ordinary Disney slapdash film displays great loads of amusement , fun , giggles , race cars and is pretty entertaining . It's an enjoyable movie for kids and for those who like cars racing round and round and bounds and leaps by Herbie . The actors seem to enjoy immensely , as Ken Berry and Stephanie Powers play of sympathetic manner and the mean-spirited owner Keenan Wynn , as excessive villain , is top notch . Colorful cinematography and jolly soundtrack including the lively leitmotif , usual in the Herbie's series. This is a delightful film , the original film turns out to be : &uml;The love bug&uml; (1969) by Robert Stevenson , followed by &uml; Herbie rides again , Herbie goes to Montecarlo , Herbie goes bananas &uml; among others and a 1997-for-television-movie and a TV series , the most part filmed by Stevenson and Vincent McEveety and usually starred by Dean Jones . Furthermore recent version starred by Linsay Lohan , Justin Long and Matt Dillon , being directed by Angela Robinson. This " Herbie rides again &uml;versi on is amusing and with lots of laughs but is a familiar film . The motion picture is correctly directed by Robert Stevenson .Worthwhile seeing , it's a great fun to watch and there are loads of entertainment in this one . It' one of the best and funniest of &uml;Herbie&uml; series .

    Years ago, I saw Herbie Rides Again at a drive-in with my parents and recently I saw the movie for the first time in years when it aired on TCM. After more than 35 years from its original release, Herbie Rides Agam is a solid sequel to The Love Bug. The cast was outstanding, including Keenan Wynn reprising his role as ruthless real estate baron Alonzo Hawk, Helen Hayes as Mrs. Steinmetz, Ken Berry as Hawks nephew Willoughby and Stefanie Powers as Nicole. But the real star of the show was Herbie, the Volkswagen. No. 53 was back in action in his help to save Mrs. Steinmetz's firehouse from destruction by Hawk for a new skyscraper. The car with a mind of its own was aided by outstanding special effects. My favorite scene was near the end when Herbie and a fleet of Volkswagens teamed up to save the firehouse from being razed. I also liked the scenes of San Francisco, especially Fisherman's Wharf. Who would have thought that the movie's success would lead to two more sequels in the 70s and a recent update with Lindsey Lohan? Rev it up and rent it.

    Another of my favorite movies from childhood, I classify this movie as being as good as the original for a number of reasons. Lines, this movie has a lot of funny lines and good actors. I can still today go back and look at the film and laugh at some of the scenes and lines in this film. Another good thing in this film is footage. Herbie is literally everywhere in this film. Yes it gets a bit corny at times but its not so corny as to be unwatchable. The film has aged and it really does show its era, but that doesn't detract from it's enjoyability factor. This is a good family movie even if it does have a few scenes that boarder on pg.

    The looong opening sequence of buildings being demolished, followed by a looong sequence of a corporate meeting, should have clued me in that this entry would have little charm that was in the original. (Phantom Menace, anyone? Trade disputes are always so exciting.) I hadn't seen it since it first came out, and only recalled a few things from it. Whereas The Love Bug kicks things into gear from the get-go, this thing drags on interminably. Herbie shows little personality in this one, and is merely a vehicle for bad process-shot special effects. (Most of the ones in the original were done practically, i.e. live.) The original characters Jim and Tennessee are disposed of with throw-away lines. I find it hard to believe that Jim would "go off to Europe to race foreign cars" (and leave Herbie?) when it was practically the entire premise of The Love Bug that Herbie was just as good, and better, than any of them. It may be "good for kids" but a good movie can get adults to enjoy it just as much.
