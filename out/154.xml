    The Life of Brian is the second installment of the Monty Python films. And what a film it is. Probably one of the greatest comedy films in history. Life of Brian is as memorable as it is original. And I think there's more. I've seen all of Monty Python's films however I don't know much about him or anyone involved in the films. But I think that Life of Brian gives us a message. To Always Look on the Bright Side of Life. I don't think it's just a song at the end of the movie. I think it's a message. Because all of Monty Python's films are making fun of situations. Some frightening or dangerous situations. But the point is that it makes you happy(No doubt about that). It makes light of things. Which is how everyone should live their lives. Some religious people take it too seriously. I'm just saying to lay back and take a joke. This is coming from a raised Christian. The film isn't anti-Christian. It doesn't once mock Jesus or deny the existence of God. I'd say that this film has inspired me to look on the bright side of life no matter what. To be happy. This is a very funny and original comedy. It's a must see film which everyone should enjoy. Python's genius in comedy, returns for another equally great film.

    Possibly Monty Python's greatest work, 'Life of Brian' is a much controversial parody of Christianity. Brian, the main character, is born on the stable next door to Jesus; he joins an anti-Roman organization and ends up mistaken as a Messiah. From Jesus sermon on the mount all the way to crucifixion, many moments of Brian's life parallels those of Christ's. This movie is a rare combination of laugh-out-loud silly comedy, and highly intelligent satire; something only Monty Python knew how to do effectively. There's nearly no scene where jokes are not made, and yet the narrative flows perfectly. The Pythons are marvelous as always, with special mention to Terry Jones as Brian's mother (he was always at his best doing female characters), Graham Chapman as Brian, and Eric Idle in pretty much all of his roles. As a catholic, I had no trouble with the film. I'm not the church-going type, but I'm a firm believer in God, Jesus, Mary and the saints; yet, I have no problem with religious satire as long as it is smart and not just senselessly offensive. In truth, some of the funniest bits are exactly those revolving around Brian's following once he is mistaken as a prophet (and even HOW this mistake happened). People sanctifying everything of his, their extremist belief, his 'miracles', and their attacking at 'unbelievers'... It is hilarious, yet not wrong or unreal at all! Just the fact so many extremists got angry at the film and the whole controversy it caused are proof of the Pythons' point. Another great thing was the political satire in this. The whole (sub)plot about the anti-Roman activism was hilariously well done, and quite a jab at all the left-leaning 'revolutionaries' and 'freedom fighters' from all around the world. The altercation between the leader (John Cleese) and Stan/'Loretta' (Eric Idle), as well as a later meeting between the members (with the iconic 'What did the Romans ever do to us?' discussion) are memorable. Other remarkable moments: the animated (by Terry Gilliam) title sequence, the stoning, and the crucifixion. The ending, with Eric Idle singing 'Always Look on the Bright Side of Life', is great.

    Life of Brian is a fantastic movie with a surprisingly different and extremely risky storyline from the Monty Python crew and the six main cast members do a terrific job with all the wacky characters they play.Its without a doubt one of my favourite comedies,there's very few parts in this movie that don't make me laugh.The Holy Grail is Monty Python's best work,but Life of Brian is very close.I love all the hilarious random scenes,like when Brian falls into a alien spaceship,and it stuff like this that is reason why I love Monty Python,and 'Always Look On the Bright Side of Life' is one of my favourite movie songs of all time,it always cheers me up if i'm in a bad mood.Fans of Monty Python won't be disappointed by Life of Brian. Revolves around the life of Brian (Graham Chapman),a boy who was born the same night as Jesus Christ in a nearby stable and is mistaken for being the real messiah.

    How surprised am I that trite like this should end up in the IMDb top 250. Another boring 'comedy' from the stables of Monty Python. Please avoid this movie at all costs. The laughs come few and far between and at the most I managed a snicker. Story is (if you care, because its not about that) a boy is born to a man dressed up as a woman who shrieks all the time and gets on your nerves till they are stretched to the limits. As a matter of fact most of the characters in this movie squeal a lot to the effect that I almost thought that this is a move about pigs disguised as humans. So yeah Brian is born to a man dressed up as a woman on the same day as Christ in a stable adjacent to the stable where Christ is born. And Jesus Christ does it get worse from there. He grows up to hate the Romans and joins a group of liberalists who are plotting against the Romans. From there on Brian finds himself at the wrong place and the wrong time usually to eventually become a messiah of sorts to eventually be strung up for crucifixion to eventually sing his way into the sunset. The same people play different roles(you will see familiar faces playing multiple roles), you will notice the difference by the increase/decrease in pitch of their voice depending upon how irritating they are trying to be. I wasted 1.5 Hours of my life on this. You have been warned!

    Now, if you're a Jerry Lewis fan ( excepting the frogs for whom admiring is a way of re emasculating themselves after getting their ass's kicked for most of the 20th century ) or ye be a Three Stooge's fan no way this speaks to you. Yes, yes I know the AFI #1 comedy is that; " Some Like It Hot' OK, not bad, but aside from Marylin's incredible tush what did it really bring to the table comedy wise? Cross gender ? The Brits have been doing that for a 100 yrs. The rest of the movie, while well crafted and acted, is pretty predictable in it's construct. Now here is where AFI is chickenshit . "Life Of Brian" is not eligible , because it's not "American", yet one of their 'top 5' , "Dr. Strangelove" is, WHY ??? Both were produced in the UK. Kicker is, as I understand it, is that 'Brian' had no US distributor therefore made it ineligible for for 'AFI' consideration. ( Please correct if wrong ). Now, I'm gonna catch hell for this, but Monty's big cash cow 'Holy Grail', does nothing for me. OK, maybe the stage thing works ( I have not seen it ), but the movie didn't, not by a long shot. Pointless, Jerry Lewis spasmodic slapstick. I call your attention to the first 'Pink Panther' movie. While Sellers was not meant to be the focus of the movie ( there were many stars in it ) his bumbling inspector became a franchise. & in each following movie it became worser ( forget spellcheck, I know I'm leaving good grammar...as if I ever had ever had any..) It was in the first 'Panther ' , that the great Mr. Sellers, did his finest work of the series. Understood , he was doing slapstick, BUT, not over the top; Jerry Lewis, 3 Stooges , in your face stupid buffoonery, it was always in denial, & that's what made it great. ( OK a couple of bits may have been a push, but the rest; pillcrunching in the bathroom etc., you must give credit for the wonderful subtlety of his performance ). Well, that's where I am, humor in any form , only works if it is not an in your face farce, but has a wry edge. Preferably keenly sharp, intelligent, and to the bone. AND that is 'Life Of Brian'. (For the most part )

    It's worth noting right off the bat that I've never seen anything Monty Python before except for the Ministry of Silly Walks. No, not even Holy Grail. Yet. But I expected quite a bit from Life of Brian, seeing as the Pythons are some of the most revered comedians of all time. I was sadly disappointed. Life of Brian just never hit an exceptionally high, focused note. To start, the whole thing looks like a B- movie. It's as visually cheesy as a late 50's movie, and while the star of a comedy is its writing and delivery, the poor technical delivery is a major distraction. Then we move into the plot- I feel that Brian suffers from a poor plot that can't live up to its premise, if that makes sense. The initial scene, the manger next door, is a fantastic idea. The 'mistaken messiah' is genius. But the 'protesting Jews' that makes up half the film made me scratch my head- why? It's unfocused and the point is unclear, so I was always edgy and it distracted further from the comedy. Into the actual jokes themselves, some hit with me and others failed. The best parts of the film are Palin's "Biggus Dickus" questioning and the final scene, peaking with the Jewish Peole's Front Suicide Squad. The whole Messiah angle is made humorously relevant if you consider the idiots at Westboro Baptist. But there are jokes that flew over my head or just didn't register- a man in drag isn't a winner for me, and a strange, Otherworldly scene- which my parents told me was out of their TV series- made no sense. I was initially very sour about this film. It's most likely that there's a generation gap thing, although I do have a lack of affinity for comedies as a whole. Although even a day has been kind to this film- it's worth noting I felt the same way about Apocalypse Now when I first saw that, and that's another unfair comparison I've made with this film. I can't believe these two films were played beside each other in a theatre (or not, in Norway). Anyway, to parents wishing to show old comedies to the younger generation, don't start with this one. 7.3/10

    One of the sad things about organised religion, and I am not speaking about Christianity in particular here, is the lack of humor that many of them have. If God created the world and everything in it, then as a part of that creation came laughter, and I suspect that even the bible has good things about laughter, and the joy that such laughter brings. In many cases when I think about religion all I tend to see are sad and glum people, much like the flagellates, who forever whip themselves believing that by inflicting pain upon themselves they can bring themselves closer to God. I think the opposite is true though because in reality it is not pain that will bring you closer to God, but laughter. I guess the reason that many Christian fundamentalists are so offended with this movie is not that because it mocks Jesus, it doesn't, but because the film exposes to them what they really are, and the one thing people do not like is to have the truth exposed to them. In fact they wonder around like the three monkeys, covering their eyes, ears, and mouths, for fear that if they were to open them they will be opening themselves to the possibility of hell. However, truth be told, it is sad that many of these people live joyless lives with the hope of heaven only to discover that heaven has been denied to them. However there is one aspect of this film that I do believe that is incorrect, and that is the ex-leper. From my understanding of the gospels is that Jesus only healed people who wanted to be healed. In fact that is a theme that runs through all of these healing miracles, and that is the desire to be healed. It was not the case of Jesus popping up behind somebody and hey presto, they were healed. I am doubtful that anybody that wanted to be a leper would have ever actually been healed by Jesus (though it still made a very amusing scene, along with pretty much the rest of this film).

    Hilarious......no other word can describe this film! I've seen it many times and it still makes me laugh. It just is crazy and silly. enough so to make you laugh out loud! Yes there are some really weird bits including the alien spaceship out of nowhere....whats all that about? :P but hey it just keeps getting more and more stupidly funny. i would say a definite Nine out of ten. i wouldn't go for a ten out of ten because it isn't everybody's sort of film. but i wouldn't give it an eight because i still love it all the same. difficult one but a good film indeed. i wouldn't say its a must see though purely because it its not the kind of film that id show everyone or have a film night it with friends its not that kind of film. But i do like to express my view about it. Good film if you have got it but i wouldn't really buy it. A Definite 9/10 though no question! thanks for reading and happy reviewing :)

    This film is epic. While it doesn't contain as many jokes as The Holy Grail, it makes up by having a better story, way better in fact, and overall a much stronger overall sense of being a whole film, instead of a simple sequence of jokes. This finally magnifies the whole comedic experience of watching the film, since the jokes become stronger and it is more like a a film-length episode of Seinfeld, where the "main" joke is constructed during the whole length of the episode. This film is obligatory for someone who likes films, I would rank it as the third of the second greatest comedy ever made (the first is Dr. Strangelove, of course).

    Life of Brian, is a British comedy film written, directed and largely performed by the Monty Python comedy team that includes Graham Chapman,John Cleese,Terry Gilliam,Eric Idle,Terry Jones and Michael Palin. It tells the story of Brian Cohen,played by Graham Chapman, a young Jewish man who is born on the same day as, and next door to, Jesus Christ, and is subsequently mistaken for the Messiah.The film contains themes of religious satire that were controversial at the time of its release. On a midnight clear 2,000 years ago, three wise men enter a manger where a babe is wrapped in swaddling clothes. It is an infant called Brian...and the three wise men are in the wrong manger. For the rest of his life, Brian finds himself regarded as something of a messiah and yet he's always in the shadow of this other guy from Galilee. Brian is witness to the Sermon of the Mount, but his seat is in such a bad location that he can't hear any of it. Ultimately, he is brought before Pontius Pilate and sentenced to crucifixion, which takes place at that crowded, nonexclusive execution site a few blocks shy of Calvary. Rather than utter the Last Six Words, Brian leads his fellow crucifixees in a spirited rendition of a British music-hall cheer-up song "Always Look on the Bright Side of Life." The movie looked back 2000 years for its comic content, but was a decade ahead in provoking Christian controversy during its time of release.The historical lampoon of religious fanaticism may not be quite as hilarious as The Holy Grail but it's even more ambitious as it is far ahead of its time for it is a religious satire that does not target specific religions or religious leaders like, say, Jesus of Nazareth. Instead, it pokes fun at the mindless and fanatical among their followers which is an attack on religious zealotry and hypocrisy,which are things that that fellow from Nazareth didn't particularly care for either.Overall,it is one of the more cutting edge films of the 1970's for this religious farce from the classic comedy troupe is as poignant as it is funny and satirical.

I can't believe these two films were played beside each other in a theatre (or not, in Norway). Anyway, to parents wishing to show old comedies to the younger generation, don't start with this one. 7.3/10

    One of the sad things about organised religion, and I am not speaking about Christianity in particular here, is the lack of humor that many of them have. If God created the world and everything in it, then as a part of that creation came laughter, and I suspect that even the bible has good things about laughter, and the joy that such laughter brings. In many cases when I think about religion all I tend to see are sad and glum people, much like the flagellates, who forever whip themselves believing that by inflicting pain upon themselves they can bring themselves closer to God. I think the opposite is true though because in reality it is not pain that will bring you closer to God, but laughter. I guess the reason that many Christian fundamentalists are so offended with this movie is not that because it mocks Jesus, it doesn't, but because the film exposes to them what they really are, and the one thing people do not like is to have the truth exposed to them. In fact they wonder around like the three monkeys, covering their eyes, ears, and mouths, for fear that if they were to open them they will be opening themselves to the possibility of hell. However, truth be told, it is sad that many of these people live joyless lives with the hope of heaven only to discover that heaven has been denied to them. However there is one aspect of this film that I do believe that is incorrect, and that is the ex-leper. From my understanding of the gospels is that Jesus only healed people who wanted to be healed. In fact that is a theme that runs through all of these healing miracles, and that is the desire to be healed. It was not the case of Jesus popping up behind somebody and hey presto, they were healed. I am doubtful that anybody that wanted to be a leper would have ever actually been healed by Jesus (though it still made a very amusing scene, along with pretty much the rest of this film).

    Hilarious......no other word can describe this film! I've seen it many times and it still makes me laugh. It just is crazy and silly. enough so to make you laugh out loud! Yes there are some really weird bits including the alien spaceship out of nowhere....whats all that about? :P but hey it just keeps getting more and more stupidly funny. i would say a definite Nine out of ten. i wouldn't go for a ten out of ten because it isn't everybody's sort of film. but i wouldn't give it an eight because i still love it all the same. difficult one but a good film indeed. i wouldn't say its a must see though purely because it its not the kind of film that id show everyone or have a film night it with friends its not that kind of film. But i do like to express my view about it. Good film if you have got it but i wouldn't really buy it. A Definite 9/10 though no question! thanks for reading and happy reviewing :)

    This film is epic. While it doesn't contain as many jokes as The Holy Grail, it makes up by having a better story, way better in fact, and overall a much stronger overall sense of being a whole film, instead of a simple sequence of jokes. This finally magnifies the whole comedic experience of watching the film, since the jokes become stronger and it is more like a a film-length episode of Seinfeld, where the "main" joke is constructed during the whole length of the episode. This film is obligatory for someone who likes films, I would rank it as the third of the second greatest comedy ever made (the first is Dr. Strangelove, of course).

    Life of Brian, is a British comedy film written, directed and largely performed by the Monty Python comedy team that includes Graham Chapman,John Cleese,Terry Gilliam,Eric Idle,Terry Jones and Michael Palin. It tells the story of Brian Cohen,played by Graham Chapman, a young Jewish man who is born on the same day as, and next door to, Jesus Christ, and is subsequently mistaken for the Messiah.The film contains themes of religious satire that were controversial at the time of its release. On a midnight clear 2,000 years ago, three wise men enter a manger where a babe is wrapped in swaddling clothes. It is an infant called Brian...and the three wise men are in the wrong manger. For the rest of his life, Brian finds himself regarded as something of a messiah and yet he's always in the shadow of this other guy from Galilee. Brian is witness to the Sermon of the Mount, but his seat is in such a bad location that he can't hear any of it. Ultimately, he is brought before Pontius Pilate and sentenced to crucifixion, which takes place at that crowded, nonexclusive execution site a few blocks shy of Calvary. Rather than utter the Last Six Words, Brian leads his fellow crucifixees in a spirited rendition of a British music-hall cheer-up song "Always Look on the Bright Side of Life." The movie looked back 2000 years for its comic content, but was a decade ahead in provoking Christian controversy during its time of release.The historical lampoon of religious fanaticism may not be quite as hilarious as The Holy Grail but it's even more ambitious as it is far ahead of its time for it is a religious satire that does not target specific religions or religious leaders like, say, Jesus of Nazareth. Instead, it pokes fun at the mindless and fanatical among their followers which is an attack on religious zealotry and hypocrisy,which are things that that fellow from Nazareth didn't particularly care for either.Overall,it is one of the more cutting edge films of the 1970's for this religious farce from the classic comedy troupe is as poignant as it is funny and satirical.

    The Life of Brian is the second installment of the Monty Python films. And what a film it is. Probably one of the greatest comedy films in history. Life of Brian is as memorable as it is original. And I think there's more. I've seen all of Monty Python's films however I don't know much about him or anyone involved in the films. But I think that Life of Brian gives us a message. To Always Look on the Bright Side of Life. I don't think it's just a song at the end of the movie. I think it's a message. Because all of Monty Python's films are making fun of situations. Some frightening or dangerous situations. But the point is that it makes you happy(No doubt about that). It makes light of things. Which is how everyone should live their lives. Some religious people take it too seriously. I'm just saying to lay back and take a joke. This is coming from a raised Christian. The film isn't anti-Christian. It doesn't once mock Jesus or deny the existence of God. I'd say that this film has inspired me to look on the bright side of life no matter what. To be happy. This is a very funny and original comedy. It's a must see film which everyone should enjoy. Python's genius in comedy, returns for another equally great film.

    Possibly Monty Python's greatest work, 'Life of Brian' is a much controversial parody of Christianity. Brian, the main character, is born on the stable next door to Jesus; he joins an anti-Roman organization and ends up mistaken as a Messiah. From Jesus sermon on the mount all the way to crucifixion, many moments of Brian's life parallels those of Christ's. This movie is a rare combination of laugh-out-loud silly comedy, and highly intelligent satire; something only Monty Python knew how to do effectively. There's nearly no scene where jokes are not made, and yet the narrative flows perfectly. The Pythons are marvelous as always, with special mention to Terry Jones as Brian's mother (he was always at his best doing female characters), Graham Chapman as Brian, and Eric Idle in pretty much all of his roles. As a catholic, I had no trouble with the film. I'm not the church-going type, but I'm a firm believer in God, Jesus, Mary and the saints; yet, I have no problem with religious satire as long as it is smart and not just senselessly offensive. In truth, some of the funniest bits are exactly those revolving around Brian's following once he is mistaken as a prophet (and even HOW this mistake happened). People sanctifying everything of his, their extremist belief, his 'miracles', and their attacking at 'unbelievers'... It is hilarious, yet not wrong or unreal at all! Just the fact so many extremists got angry at the film and the whole controversy it caused are proof of the Pythons' point. Another great thing was the political satire in this. The whole (sub)plot about the anti-Roman activism was hilariously well done, and quite a jab at all the left-leaning 'revolutionaries' and 'freedom fighters' from all around the world. The altercation between the leader (John Cleese) and Stan/'Loretta' (Eric Idle), as well as a later meeting between the members (with the iconic 'What did the Romans ever do to us?' discussion) are memorable. Other remarkable moments: the animated (by Terry Gilliam) title sequence, the stoning, and the crucifixion. The ending, with Eric Idle singing 'Always Look on the Bright Side of Life', is great.

    Life of Brian is a fantastic movie with a surprisingly different and extremely risky storyline from the Monty Python crew and the six main cast members do a terrific job with all the wacky characters they play.Its without a doubt one of my favourite comedies,there's very few parts in this movie that don't make me laugh.The Holy Grail is Monty Python's best work,but Life of Brian is very close.I love all the hilarious random scenes,like when Brian falls into a alien spaceship,and it stuff like this that is reason why I love Monty Python,and 'Always Look On the Bright Side of Life' is one of my favourite movie songs of all time,it always cheers me up if i'm in a bad mood.Fans of Monty Python won't be disappointed by Life of Brian. Revolves around the life of Brian (Graham Chapman),a boy who was born the same night as Jesus Christ in a nearby stable and is mistaken for being the real messiah.

    How surprised am I that trite like this should end up in the IMDb top 250. Another boring 'comedy' from the stables of Monty Python. Please avoid this movie at all costs. The laughs come few and far between and at the most I managed a snicker. Story is (if you care, because its not about that) a boy is born to a man dressed up as a woman who shrieks all the time and gets on your nerves till they are stretched to the limits. As a matter of fact most of the characters in this movie squeal a lot to the effect that I almost thought that this is a move about pigs disguised as humans. So yeah Brian is born to a man dressed up as a woman on the same day as Christ in a stable adjacent to the stable where Christ is born. And Jesus Christ does it get worse from there. He grows up to hate the Romans and joins a group of liberalists who are plotting against the Romans. From there on Brian finds himself at the wrong place and the wrong time usually to eventually become a messiah of sorts to eventually be strung up for crucifixion to eventually sing his way into the sunset. The same people play different roles(you will see familiar faces playing multiple roles), you will notice the difference by the increase/decrease in pitch of their voice depending upon how irritating they are trying to be. I wasted 1.5 Hours of my life on this. You have been warned!

    Now, if you're a Jerry Lewis fan ( excepting the frogs for whom admiring is a way of re emasculating themselves after getting their ass's kicked for most of the 20th century ) or ye be a Three Stooge's fan no way this speaks to you. Yes, yes I know the AFI #1 comedy is that; " Some Like It Hot' OK, not bad, but aside from Marylin's incredible tush what did it really bring to the table comedy wise? Cross gender ? The Brits have been doing that for a 100 yrs. The rest of the movie, while well crafted and acted, is pretty predictable in it's construct. Now here is where AFI is chickenshit . "Life Of Brian" is not eligible , because it's not "American", yet one of their 'top 5' , "Dr. Strangelove" is, WHY ??? Both were produced in the UK. Kicker is, as I understand it, is that 'Brian' had no US distributor therefore made it ineligible for for 'AFI' consideration. ( Please correct if wrong ). Now, I'm gonna catch hell for this, but Monty's big cash cow 'Holy Grail', does nothing for me. OK, maybe the stage thing works ( I have not seen it ), but the movie didn't, not by a long shot. Pointless, Jerry Lewis spasmodic slapstick. I call your attention to the first 'Pink Panther' movie. While Sellers was not meant to be the focus of the movie ( there were many stars in it ) his bumbling inspector became a franchise. & in each following movie it became worser ( forget spellcheck, I know I'm leaving good grammar...as if I ever had ever had any..) It was in the first 'Panther ' , that the great Mr. Sellers, did his finest work of the series. Understood , he was doing slapstick, BUT, not over the top; Jerry Lewis, 3 Stooges , in your face stupid buffoonery, it was always in denial, & that's what made it great. ( OK a couple of bits may have been a push, but the rest; pillcrunching in the bathroom etc., you must give credit for the wonderful subtlety of his performance ). Well, that's where I am, humor in any form , only works if it is not an in your face farce, but has a wry edge. Preferably keenly sharp, intelligent, and to the bone. AND that is 'Life Of Brian'. (For the most part )

    It's worth noting right off the bat that I've never seen anything Monty Python before except for the Ministry of Silly Walks. No, not even Holy Grail. Yet. But I expected quite a bit from Life of Brian, seeing as the Pythons are some of the most revered comedians of all time. I was sadly disappointed. Life of Brian just never hit an exceptionally high, focused note. To start, the whole thing looks like a B- movie. It's as visually cheesy as a late 50's movie, and while the star of a comedy is its writing and delivery, the poor technical delivery is a major distraction. Then we move into the plot- I feel that Brian suffers from a poor plot that can't live up to its premise, if that makes sense. The initial scene, the manger next door, is a fantastic idea. The 'mistaken messiah' is genius. But the 'protesting Jews' that makes up half the film made me scratch my head- why? It's unfocused and the point is unclear, so I was always edgy and it distracted further from the comedy. Into the actual jokes themselves, some hit with me and others failed. The best parts of the film are Palin's "Biggus Dickus" questioning and the final scene, peaking with the Jewish Peole's Front Suicide Squad. The whole Messiah angle is made humorously relevant if you consider the idiots at Westboro Baptist. But there are jokes that flew over my head or just didn't register- a man in drag isn't a winner for me, and a strange, Otherworldly scene- which my parents told me was out of their TV series- made no sense. I was initially very sour about this film. It's most likely that there's a generation gap thing, although I do have a lack of affinity for comedies as a whole. Although even a day has been kind to this film- it's worth noting I felt the same way about Apocalypse Now when I first saw that, and that's another unfair comparison I've made with this film. I can't believe these two films were played beside each other in a theatre (or not, in Norway). Anyway, to parents wishing to show old comedies to the younger generation, don't start with this one. 7.3/10

So yeah Brian is born to a man dressed up as a woman on the same day as Christ in a stable adjacent to the stable where Christ is born. And Jesus Christ does it get worse from there. He grows up to hate the Romans and joins a group of liberalists who are plotting against the Romans. From there on Brian finds himself at the wrong place and the wrong time usually to eventually become a messiah of sorts to eventually be strung up for crucifixion to eventually sing his way into the sunset. The same people play different roles(you will see familiar faces playing multiple roles), you will notice the difference by the increase/decrease in pitch of their voice depending upon how irritating they are trying to be. I wasted 1.5 Hours of my life on this. You have been warned!

    Now, if you're a Jerry Lewis fan ( excepting the frogs for whom admiring is a way of re emasculating themselves after getting their ass's kicked for most of the 20th century ) or ye be a Three Stooge's fan no way this speaks to you. Yes, yes I know the AFI #1 comedy is that; " Some Like It Hot' OK, not bad, but aside from Marylin's incredible tush what did it really bring to the table comedy wise? Cross gender ? The Brits have been doing that for a 100 yrs. The rest of the movie, while well crafted and acted, is pretty predictable in it's construct. Now here is where AFI is chickenshit . "Life Of Brian" is not eligible , because it's not "American", yet one of their 'top 5' , "Dr. Strangelove" is, WHY ??? Both were produced in the UK. Kicker is, as I understand it, is that 'Brian' had no US distributor therefore made it ineligible for for 'AFI' consideration. ( Please correct if wrong ). Now, I'm gonna catch hell for this, but Monty's big cash cow 'Holy Grail', does nothing for me. OK, maybe the stage thing works ( I have not seen it ), but the movie didn't, not by a long shot. Pointless, Jerry Lewis spasmodic slapstick. I call your attention to the first 'Pink Panther' movie. While Sellers was not meant to be the focus of the movie ( there were many stars in it ) his bumbling inspector became a franchise. & in each following movie it became worser ( forget spellcheck, I know I'm leaving good grammar...as if I ever had ever had any..) It was in the first 'Panther ' , that the great Mr. Sellers, did his finest work of the series. Understood , he was doing slapstick, BUT, not over the top; Jerry Lewis, 3 Stooges , in your face stupid buffoonery, it was always in denial, & that's what made it great. ( OK a couple of bits may have been a push, but the rest; pillcrunching in the bathroom etc., you must give credit for the wonderful subtlety of his performance ). Well, that's where I am, humor in any form , only works if it is not an in your face farce, but has a wry edge. Preferably keenly sharp, intelligent, and to the bone. AND that is 'Life Of Brian'. (For the most part )

    It's worth noting right off the bat that I've never seen anything Monty Python before except for the Ministry of Silly Walks. No, not even Holy Grail. Yet. But I expected quite a bit from Life of Brian, seeing as the Pythons are some of the most revered comedians of all time. I was sadly disappointed. Life of Brian just never hit an exceptionally high, focused note. To start, the whole thing looks like a B- movie. It's as visually cheesy as a late 50's movie, and while the star of a comedy is its writing and delivery, the poor technical delivery is a major distraction. Then we move into the plot- I feel that Brian suffers from a poor plot that can't live up to its premise, if that makes sense. The initial scene, the manger next door, is a fantastic idea. The 'mistaken messiah' is genius. But the 'protesting Jews' that makes up half the film made me scratch my head- why? It's unfocused and the point is unclear, so I was always edgy and it distracted further from the comedy. Into the actual jokes themselves, some hit with me and others failed. The best parts of the film are Palin's "Biggus Dickus" questioning and the final scene, peaking with the Jewish Peole's Front Suicide Squad. The whole Messiah angle is made humorously relevant if you consider the idiots at Westboro Baptist. But there are jokes that flew over my head or just didn't register- a man in drag isn't a winner for me, and a strange, Otherworldly scene- which my parents told me was out of their TV series- made no sense. I was initially very sour about this film. It's most likely that there's a generation gap thing, although I do have a lack of affinity for comedies as a whole. Although even a day has been kind to this film- it's worth noting I felt the same way about Apocalypse Now when I first saw that, and that's another unfair comparison I've made with this film. I can't believe these two films were played beside each other in a theatre (or not, in Norway). Anyway, to parents wishing to show old comedies to the younger generation, don't start with this one. 7.3/10

    One of the sad things about organised religion, and I am not speaking about Christianity in particular here, is the lack of humor that many of them have. If God created the world and everything in it, then as a part of that creation came laughter, and I suspect that even the bible has good things about laughter, and the joy that such laughter brings. In many cases when I think about religion all I tend to see are sad and glum people, much like the flagellates, who forever whip themselves believing that by inflicting pain upon themselves they can bring themselves closer to God. I think the opposite is true though because in reality it is not pain that will bring you closer to God, but laughter. I guess the reason that many Christian fundamentalists are so offended with this movie is not that because it mocks Jesus, it doesn't, but because the film exposes to them what they really are, and the one thing people do not like is to have the truth exposed to them. In fact they wonder around like the three monkeys, covering their eyes, ears, and mouths, for fear that if they were to open them they will be opening themselves to the possibility of hell. However, truth be told, it is sad that many of these people live joyless lives with the hope of heaven only to discover that heaven has been denied to them. However there is one aspect of this film that I do believe that is incorrect, and that is the ex-leper. From my understanding of the gospels is that Jesus only healed people who wanted to be healed. In fact that is a theme that runs through all of these healing miracles, and that is the desire to be healed. It was not the case of Jesus popping up behind somebody and hey presto, they were healed. I am doubtful that anybody that wanted to be a leper would have ever actually been healed by Jesus (though it still made a very amusing scene, along with pretty much the rest of this film).

    Hilarious......no other word can describe this film! I've seen it many times and it still makes me laugh. It just is crazy and silly. enough so to make you laugh out loud! Yes there are some really weird bits including the alien spaceship out of nowhere....whats all that about? :P but hey it just keeps getting more and more stupidly funny. i would say a definite Nine out of ten. i wouldn't go for a ten out of ten because it isn't everybody's sort of film. but i wouldn't give it an eight because i still love it all the same. difficult one but a good film indeed. i wouldn't say its a must see though purely because it its not the kind of film that id show everyone or have a film night it with friends its not that kind of film. But i do like to express my view about it. Good film if you have got it but i wouldn't really buy it. A Definite 9/10 though no question! thanks for reading and happy reviewing :)

    This film is epic. While it doesn't contain as many jokes as The Holy Grail, it makes up by having a better story, way better in fact, and overall a much stronger overall sense of being a whole film, instead of a simple sequence of jokes. This finally magnifies the whole comedic experience of watching the film, since the jokes become stronger and it is more like a a film-length episode of Seinfeld, where the "main" joke is constructed during the whole length of the episode. This film is obligatory for someone who likes films, I would rank it as the third of the second greatest comedy ever made (the first is Dr. Strangelove, of course).

    Life of Brian, is a British comedy film written, directed and largely performed by the Monty Python comedy team that includes Graham Chapman,John Cleese,Terry Gilliam,Eric Idle,Terry Jones and Michael Palin. It tells the story of Brian Cohen,played by Graham Chapman, a young Jewish man who is born on the same day as, and next door to, Jesus Christ, and is subsequently mistaken for the Messiah.The film contains themes of religious satire that were controversial at the time of its release. On a midnight clear 2,000 years ago, three wise men enter a manger where a babe is wrapped in swaddling clothes. It is an infant called Brian...and the three wise men are in the wrong manger. For the rest of his life, Brian finds himself regarded as something of a messiah and yet he's always in the shadow of this other guy from Galilee. Brian is witness to the Sermon of the Mount, but his seat is in such a bad location that he can't hear any of it. Ultimately, he is brought before Pontius Pilate and sentenced to crucifixion, which takes place at that crowded, nonexclusive execution site a few blocks shy of Calvary. Rather than utter the Last Six Words, Brian leads his fellow crucifixees in a spirited rendition of a British music-hall cheer-up song "Always Look on the Bright Side of Life." The movie looked back 2000 years for its comic content, but was a decade ahead in provoking Christian controversy during its time of release.The historical lampoon of religious fanaticism may not be quite as hilarious as The Holy Grail but it's even more ambitious as it is far ahead of its time for it is a religious satire that does not target specific religions or religious leaders like, say, Jesus of Nazareth. Instead, it pokes fun at the mindless and fanatical among their followers which is an attack on religious zealotry and hypocrisy,which are things that that fellow from Nazareth didn't particularly care for either.Overall,it is one of the more cutting edge films of the 1970's for this religious farce from the classic comedy troupe is as poignant as it is funny and satirical.

    The Life of Brian is the second installment of the Monty Python films. And what a film it is. Probably one of the greatest comedy films in history. Life of Brian is as memorable as it is original. And I think there's more. I've seen all of Monty Python's films however I don't know much about him or anyone involved in the films. But I think that Life of Brian gives us a message. To Always Look on the Bright Side of Life. I don't think it's just a song at the end of the movie. I think it's a message. Because all of Monty Python's films are making fun of situations. Some frightening or dangerous situations. But the point is that it makes you happy(No doubt about that). It makes light of things. Which is how everyone should live their lives. Some religious people take it too seriously. I'm just saying to lay back and take a joke. This is coming from a raised Christian. The film isn't anti-Christian. It doesn't once mock Jesus or deny the existence of God. I'd say that this film has inspired me to look on the bright side of life no matter what. To be happy. This is a very funny and original comedy. It's a must see film which everyone should enjoy. Python's genius in comedy, returns for another equally great film.

    Possibly Monty Python's greatest work, 'Life of Brian' is a much controversial parody of Christianity. Brian, the main character, is born on the stable next door to Jesus; he joins an anti-Roman organization and ends up mistaken as a Messiah. From Jesus sermon on the mount all the way to crucifixion, many moments of Brian's life parallels those of Christ's. This movie is a rare combination of laugh-out-loud silly comedy, and highly intelligent satire; something only Monty Python knew how to do effectively. There's nearly no scene where jokes are not made, and yet the narrative flows perfectly. The Pythons are marvelous as always, with special mention to Terry Jones as Brian's mother (he was always at his best doing female characters), Graham Chapman as Brian, and Eric Idle in pretty much all of his roles. As a catholic, I had no trouble with the film. I'm not the church-going type, but I'm a firm believer in God, Jesus, Mary and the saints; yet, I have no problem with religious satire as long as it is smart and not just senselessly offensive. In truth, some of the funniest bits are exactly those revolving around Brian's following once he is mistaken as a prophet (and even HOW this mistake happened). People sanctifying everything of his, their extremist belief, his 'miracles', and their attacking at 'unbelievers'... It is hilarious, yet not wrong or unreal at all! Just the fact so many extremists got angry at the film and the whole controversy it caused are proof of the Pythons' point. Another great thing was the political satire in this. The whole (sub)plot about the anti-Roman activism was hilariously well done, and quite a jab at all the left-leaning 'revolutionaries' and 'freedom fighters' from all around the world. The altercation between the leader (John Cleese) and Stan/'Loretta' (Eric Idle), as well as a later meeting between the members (with the iconic 'What did the Romans ever do to us?' discussion) are memorable. Other remarkable moments: the animated (by Terry Gilliam) title sequence, the stoning, and the crucifixion. The ending, with Eric Idle singing 'Always Look on the Bright Side of Life', is great.

    Life of Brian is a fantastic movie with a surprisingly different and extremely risky storyline from the Monty Python crew and the six main cast members do a terrific job with all the wacky characters they play.Its without a doubt one of my favourite comedies,there's very few parts in this movie that don't make me laugh.The Holy Grail is Monty Python's best work,but Life of Brian is very close.I love all the hilarious random scenes,like when Brian falls into a alien spaceship,and it stuff like this that is reason why I love Monty Python,and 'Always Look On the Bright Side of Life' is one of my favourite movie songs of all time,it always cheers me up if i'm in a bad mood.Fans of Monty Python won't be disappointed by Life of Brian. Revolves around the life of Brian (Graham Chapman),a boy who was born the same night as Jesus Christ in a nearby stable and is mistaken for being the real messiah.

    How surprised am I that trite like this should end up in the IMDb top 250. Another boring 'comedy' from the stables of Monty Python. Please avoid this movie at all costs. The laughs come few and far between and at the most I managed a snicker. Story is (if you care, because its not about that) a boy is born to a man dressed up as a woman who shrieks all the time and gets on your nerves till they are stretched to the limits. As a matter of fact most of the characters in this movie squeal a lot to the effect that I almost thought that this is a move about pigs disguised as humans. So yeah Brian is born to a man dressed up as a woman on the same day as Christ in a stable adjacent to the stable where Christ is born. And Jesus Christ does it get worse from there. He grows up to hate the Romans and joins a group of liberalists who are plotting against the Romans. From there on Brian finds himself at the wrong place and the wrong time usually to eventually become a messiah of sorts to eventually be strung up for crucifixion to eventually sing his way into the sunset.

But I think that Life of Brian gives us a message. To Always Look on the Bright Side of Life. I don't think it's just a song at the end of the movie. I think it's a message. Because all of Monty Python's films are making fun of situations. Some frightening or dangerous situations. But the point is that it makes you happy(No doubt about that). It makes light of things. Which is how everyone should live their lives. Some religious people take it too seriously. I'm just saying to lay back and take a joke. This is coming from a raised Christian. The film isn't anti-Christian. It doesn't once mock Jesus or deny the existence of God. I'd say that this film has inspired me to look on the bright side of life no matter what. To be happy. This is a very funny and original comedy. It's a must see film which everyone should enjoy. Python's genius in comedy, returns for another equally great film.

    Possibly Monty Python's greatest work, 'Life of Brian' is a much controversial parody of Christianity. Brian, the main character, is born on the stable next door to Jesus; he joins an anti-Roman organization and ends up mistaken as a Messiah. From Jesus sermon on the mount all the way to crucifixion, many moments of Brian's life parallels those of Christ's. This movie is a rare combination of laugh-out-loud silly comedy, and highly intelligent satire; something only Monty Python knew how to do effectively. There's nearly no scene where jokes are not made, and yet the narrative flows perfectly. The Pythons are marvelous as always, with special mention to Terry Jones as Brian's mother (he was always at his best doing female characters), Graham Chapman as Brian, and Eric Idle in pretty much all of his roles. As a catholic, I had no trouble with the film. I'm not the church-going type, but I'm a firm believer in God, Jesus, Mary and the saints; yet, I have no problem with religious satire as long as it is smart and not just senselessly offensive. In truth, some of the funniest bits are exactly those revolving around Brian's following once he is mistaken as a prophet (and even HOW this mistake happened). People sanctifying everything of his, their extremist belief, his 'miracles', and their attacking at 'unbelievers'... It is hilarious, yet not wrong or unreal at all! Just the fact so many extremists got angry at the film and the whole controversy it caused are proof of the Pythons' point. Another great thing was the political satire in this. The whole (sub)plot about the anti-Roman activism was hilariously well done, and quite a jab at all the left-leaning 'revolutionaries' and 'freedom fighters' from all around the world. The altercation between the leader (John Cleese) and Stan/'Loretta' (Eric Idle), as well as a later meeting between the members (with the iconic 'What did the Romans ever do to us?' discussion) are memorable. Other remarkable moments: the animated (by Terry Gilliam) title sequence, the stoning, and the crucifixion. The ending, with Eric Idle singing 'Always Look on the Bright Side of Life', is great.

    Life of Brian is a fantastic movie with a surprisingly different and extremely risky storyline from the Monty Python crew and the six main cast members do a terrific job with all the wacky characters they play.Its without a doubt one of my favourite comedies,there's very few parts in this movie that don't make me laugh.The Holy Grail is Monty Python's best work,but Life of Brian is very close.I love all the hilarious random scenes,like when Brian falls into a alien spaceship,and it stuff like this that is reason why I love Monty Python,and 'Always Look On the Bright Side of Life' is one of my favourite movie songs of all time,it always cheers me up if i'm in a bad mood.Fans of Monty Python won't be disappointed by Life of Brian. Revolves around the life of Brian (Graham Chapman),a boy who was born the same night as Jesus Christ in a nearby stable and is mistaken for being the real messiah.

    How surprised am I that trite like this should end up in the IMDb top 250. Another boring 'comedy' from the stables of Monty Python. Please avoid this movie at all costs. The laughs come few and far between and at the most I managed a snicker. Story is (if you care, because its not about that) a boy is born to a man dressed up as a woman who shrieks all the time and gets on your nerves till they are stretched to the limits. As a matter of fact most of the characters in this movie squeal a lot to the effect that I almost thought that this is a move about pigs disguised as humans. So yeah Brian is born to a man dressed up as a woman on the same day as Christ in a stable adjacent to the stable where Christ is born. And Jesus Christ does it get worse from there. He grows up to hate the Romans and joins a group of liberalists who are plotting against the Romans. From there on Brian finds himself at the wrong place and the wrong time usually to eventually become a messiah of sorts to eventually be strung up for crucifixion to eventually sing his way into the sunset. The same people play different roles(you will see familiar faces playing multiple roles), you will notice the difference by the increase/decrease in pitch of their voice depending upon how irritating they are trying to be. I wasted 1.5 Hours of my life on this. You have been warned!

    Now, if you're a Jerry Lewis fan ( excepting the frogs for whom admiring is a way of re emasculating themselves after getting their ass's kicked for most of the 20th century ) or ye be a Three Stooge's fan no way this speaks to you. Yes, yes I know the AFI #1 comedy is that; " Some Like It Hot' OK, not bad, but aside from Marylin's incredible tush what did it really bring to the table comedy wise? Cross gender ? The Brits have been doing that for a 100 yrs. The rest of the movie, while well crafted and acted, is pretty predictable in it's construct. Now here is where AFI is chickenshit . "Life Of Brian" is not eligible , because it's not "American", yet one of their 'top 5' , "Dr. Strangelove" is, WHY ??? Both were produced in the UK. Kicker is, as I understand it, is that 'Brian' had no US distributor therefore made it ineligible for for 'AFI' consideration. ( Please correct if wrong ). Now, I'm gonna catch hell for this, but Monty's big cash cow 'Holy Grail', does nothing for me. OK, maybe the stage thing works ( I have not seen it ), but the movie didn't, not by a long shot. Pointless, Jerry Lewis spasmodic slapstick. I call your attention to the first 'Pink Panther' movie. While Sellers was not meant to be the focus of the movie ( there were many stars in it ) his bumbling inspector became a franchise. & in each following movie it became worser ( forget spellcheck, I know I'm leaving good grammar...as if I ever had ever had any..) It was in the first 'Panther ' , that the great Mr. Sellers, did his finest work of the series. Understood , he was doing slapstick, BUT, not over the top; Jerry Lewis, 3 Stooges , in your face stupid buffoonery, it was always in denial, & that's what made it great. ( OK a couple of bits may have been a push, but the rest; pillcrunching in the bathroom etc., you must give credit for the wonderful subtlety of his performance ). Well, that's where I am, humor in any form , only works if it is not an in your face farce, but has a wry edge. Preferably keenly sharp, intelligent, and to the bone. AND that is 'Life Of Brian'. (For the most part )

    It's worth noting right off the bat that I've never seen anything Monty Python before except for the Ministry of Silly Walks. No, not even Holy Grail. Yet. But I expected quite a bit from Life of Brian, seeing as the Pythons are some of the most revered comedians of all time. I was sadly disappointed. Life of Brian just never hit an exceptionally high, focused note. To start, the whole thing looks like a B- movie. It's as visually cheesy as a late 50's movie, and while the star of a comedy is its writing and delivery, the poor technical delivery is a major distraction. Then we move into the plot- I feel that Brian suffers from a poor plot that can't live up to its premise, if that makes sense. The initial scene, the manger next door, is a fantastic idea. The 'mistaken messiah' is genius. But the 'protesting Jews' that makes up half the film made me scratch my head- why? It's unfocused and the point is unclear, so I was always edgy and it distracted further from the comedy. Into the actual jokes themselves, some hit with me and others failed. The best parts of the film are Palin's "Biggus Dickus" questioning and the final scene, peaking with the Jewish Peole's Front Suicide Squad. The whole Messiah angle is made humorously relevant if you consider the idiots at Westboro Baptist. But there are jokes that flew over my head or just didn't register- a man in drag isn't a winner for me, and a strange, Otherworldly scene- which my parents told me was out of their TV series- made no sense. I was initially very sour about this film. It's most likely that there's a generation gap thing, although I do have a lack of affinity for comedies as a whole. Although even a day has been kind to this film- it's worth noting I felt the same way about Apocalypse Now when I first saw that, and that's another unfair comparison I've made with this film. I can't believe these two films were played beside each other in a theatre (or not, in Norway). Anyway, to parents wishing to show old comedies to the younger generation, don't start with this one. 7.3/10

    One of the sad things about organised religion, and I am not speaking about Christianity in particular here, is the lack of humor that many of them have. If God created the world and everything in it, then as a part of that creation came laughter, and I suspect that even the bible has good things about laughter, and the joy that such laughter brings. In many cases when I think about religion all I tend to see are sad and glum people, much like the flagellates, who forever whip themselves believing that by inflicting pain upon themselves they can bring themselves closer to God. I think the opposite is true though because in reality it is not pain that will bring you closer to God, but laughter. I guess the reason that many Christian fundamentalists are so offended with this movie is not that because it mocks Jesus, it doesn't, but because the film exposes to them what they really are, and the one thing people do not like is to have the truth exposed to them. In fact they wonder around like the three monkeys, covering their eyes, ears, and mouths, for fear that if they were to open them they will be opening themselves to the possibility of hell. However, truth be told, it is sad that many of these people live joyless lives with the hope of heaven only to discover that heaven has been denied to them. However there is one aspect of this film that I do believe that is incorrect, and that is the ex-leper. From my understanding of the gospels is that Jesus only healed people who wanted to be healed. In fact that is a theme that runs through all of these healing miracles, and that is the desire to be healed. It was not the case of Jesus popping up behind somebody and hey presto, they were healed. I am doubtful that anybody that wanted to be a leper would have ever actually been healed by Jesus (though it still made a very amusing scene, along with pretty much the rest of this film).

    Hilarious......no other word can describe this film! I've seen it many times and it still makes me laugh. It just is crazy and silly. enough so to make you laugh out loud! Yes there are some really weird bits including the alien spaceship out of nowhere....whats all that about? :P but hey it just keeps getting more and more stupidly funny. i would say a definite Nine out of ten. i wouldn't go for a ten out of ten because it isn't everybody's sort of film. but i wouldn't give it an eight because i still love it all the same. difficult one but a good film indeed. i wouldn't say its a must see though purely because it its not the kind of film that id show everyone or have a film night it with friends its not that kind of film. But i do like to express my view about it. Good film if you have got it but i wouldn't really buy it. A Definite 9/10 though no question! thanks for reading and happy reviewing :)

    This film is epic. While it doesn't contain as many jokes as The Holy Grail, it makes up by having a better story, way better in fact, and overall a much stronger overall sense of being a whole film, instead of a simple sequence of jokes. This finally magnifies the whole comedic experience of watching the film, since the jokes become stronger and it is more like a a film-length episode of Seinfeld, where the "main" joke is constructed during the whole length of the episode. This film is obligatory for someone who likes films, I would rank it as the third of the second greatest comedy ever made (the first is Dr. Strangelove, of course).

    Life of Brian, is a British comedy film written, directed and largely performed by the Monty Python comedy team that includes Graham Chapman,John Cleese,Terry Gilliam,Eric Idle,Terry Jones and Michael Palin. It tells the story of Brian Cohen,played by Graham Chapman, a young Jewish man who is born on the same day as, and next door to, Jesus Christ, and is subsequently mistaken for the Messiah.The film contains themes of religious satire that were controversial at the time of its release. On a midnight clear 2,000 years ago, three wise men enter a manger where a babe is wrapped in swaddling clothes. It is an infant called Brian...and the three wise men are in the wrong manger. For the rest of his life, Brian finds himself regarded as something of a messiah and yet he's always in the shadow of this other guy from Galilee. Brian is witness to the Sermon of the Mount, but his seat is in such a bad location that he can't hear any of it. Ultimately, he is brought before Pontius Pilate and sentenced to crucifixion, which takes place at that crowded, nonexclusive execution site a few blocks shy of Calvary. Rather than utter the Last Six Words, Brian leads his fellow crucifixees in a spirited rendition of a British music-hall cheer-up song "Always Look on the Bright Side of Life." The movie looked back 2000 years for its comic content, but was a decade ahead in provoking Christian controversy during its time of release.The historical lampoon of religious fanaticism may not be quite as hilarious as The Holy Grail but it's even more ambitious as it is far ahead of its time for it is a religious satire that does not target specific religions or religious leaders like, say, Jesus of Nazareth. Instead, it pokes fun at the mindless and fanatical among their followers which is an attack on religious zealotry and hypocrisy,which are things that that fellow from Nazareth didn't particularly care for either.Overall,it is one of the more cutting edge films of the 1970's for this religious farce from the classic comedy troupe is as poignant as it is funny and satirical.

I am doubtful that anybody that wanted to be a leper would have ever actually been healed by Jesus (though it still made a very amusing scene, along with pretty much the rest of this film).

    Hilarious......no other word can describe this film! I've seen it many times and it still makes me laugh. It just is crazy and silly. enough so to make you laugh out loud! Yes there are some really weird bits including the alien spaceship out of nowhere....whats all that about? :P but hey it just keeps getting more and more stupidly funny. i would say a definite Nine out of ten. i wouldn't go for a ten out of ten because it isn't everybody's sort of film. but i wouldn't give it an eight because i still love it all the same. difficult one but a good film indeed. i wouldn't say its a must see though purely because it its not the kind of film that id show everyone or have a film night it with friends its not that kind of film. But i do like to express my view about it. Good film if you have got it but i wouldn't really buy it. A Definite 9/10 though no question! thanks for reading and happy reviewing :)

    This film is epic. While it doesn't contain as many jokes as The Holy Grail, it makes up by having a better story, way better in fact, and overall a much stronger overall sense of being a whole film, instead of a simple sequence of jokes. This finally magnifies the whole comedic experience of watching the film, since the jokes become stronger and it is more like a a film-length episode of Seinfeld, where the "main" joke is constructed during the whole length of the episode. This film is obligatory for someone who likes films, I would rank it as the third of the second greatest comedy ever made (the first is Dr. Strangelove, of course).

    Life of Brian, is a British comedy film written, directed and largely performed by the Monty Python comedy team that includes Graham Chapman,John Cleese,Terry Gilliam,Eric Idle,Terry Jones and Michael Palin. It tells the story of Brian Cohen,played by Graham Chapman, a young Jewish man who is born on the same day as, and next door to, Jesus Christ, and is subsequently mistaken for the Messiah.The film contains themes of religious satire that were controversial at the time of its release. On a midnight clear 2,000 years ago, three wise men enter a manger where a babe is wrapped in swaddling clothes. It is an infant called Brian...and the three wise men are in the wrong manger. For the rest of his life, Brian finds himself regarded as something of a messiah and yet he's always in the shadow of this other guy from Galilee. Brian is witness to the Sermon of the Mount, but his seat is in such a bad location that he can't hear any of it. Ultimately, he is brought before Pontius Pilate and sentenced to crucifixion, which takes place at that crowded, nonexclusive execution site a few blocks shy of Calvary. Rather than utter the Last Six Words, Brian leads his fellow crucifixees in a spirited rendition of a British music-hall cheer-up song "Always Look on the Bright Side of Life." The movie looked back 2000 years for its comic content, but was a decade ahead in provoking Christian controversy during its time of release.The historical lampoon of religious fanaticism may not be quite as hilarious as The Holy Grail but it's even more ambitious as it is far ahead of its time for it is a religious satire that does not target specific religions or religious leaders like, say, Jesus of Nazareth. Instead, it pokes fun at the mindless and fanatical among their followers which is an attack on religious zealotry and hypocrisy,which are things that that fellow from Nazareth didn't particularly care for either.Overall,it is one of the more cutting edge films of the 1970's for this religious farce from the classic comedy troupe is as poignant as it is funny and satirical.

    The Life of Brian is the second installment of the Monty Python films. And what a film it is. Probably one of the greatest comedy films in history. Life of Brian is as memorable as it is original. And I think there's more. I've seen all of Monty Python's films however I don't know much about him or anyone involved in the films. But I think that Life of Brian gives us a message. To Always Look on the Bright Side of Life. I don't think it's just a song at the end of the movie. I think it's a message. Because all of Monty Python's films are making fun of situations. Some frightening or dangerous situations. But the point is that it makes you happy(No doubt about that). It makes light of things. Which is how everyone should live their lives. Some religious people take it too seriously. I'm just saying to lay back and take a joke. This is coming from a raised Christian. The film isn't anti-Christian. It doesn't once mock Jesus or deny the existence of God. I'd say that this film has inspired me to look on the bright side of life no matter what. To be happy. This is a very funny and original comedy. It's a must see film which everyone should enjoy. Python's genius in comedy, returns for another equally great film.

    Possibly Monty Python's greatest work, 'Life of Brian' is a much controversial parody of Christianity. Brian, the main character, is born on the stable next door to Jesus; he joins an anti-Roman organization and ends up mistaken as a Messiah. From Jesus sermon on the mount all the way to crucifixion, many moments of Brian's life parallels those of Christ's. This movie is a rare combination of laugh-out-loud silly comedy, and highly intelligent satire; something only Monty Python knew how to do effectively. There's nearly no scene where jokes are not made, and yet the narrative flows perfectly. The Pythons are marvelous as always, with special mention to Terry Jones as Brian's mother (he was always at his best doing female characters), Graham Chapman as Brian, and Eric Idle in pretty much all of his roles. As a catholic, I had no trouble with the film. I'm not the church-going type, but I'm a firm believer in God, Jesus, Mary and the saints; yet, I have no problem with religious satire as long as it is smart and not just senselessly offensive. In truth, some of the funniest bits are exactly those revolving around Brian's following once he is mistaken as a prophet (and even HOW this mistake happened). People sanctifying everything of his, their extremist belief, his 'miracles', and their attacking at 'unbelievers'... It is hilarious, yet not wrong or unreal at all! Just the fact so many extremists got angry at the film and the whole controversy it caused are proof of the Pythons' point. Another great thing was the political satire in this. The whole (sub)plot about the anti-Roman activism was hilariously well done, and quite a jab at all the left-leaning 'revolutionaries' and 'freedom fighters' from all around the world. The altercation between the leader (John Cleese) and Stan/'Loretta' (Eric Idle), as well as a later meeting between the members (with the iconic 'What did the Romans ever do to us?' discussion) are memorable. Other remarkable moments: the animated (by Terry Gilliam) title sequence, the stoning, and the crucifixion. The ending, with Eric Idle singing 'Always Look on the Bright Side of Life', is great.

    Life of Brian is a fantastic movie with a surprisingly different and extremely risky storyline from the Monty Python crew and the six main cast members do a terrific job with all the wacky characters they play.Its without a doubt one of my favourite comedies,there's very few parts in this movie that don't make me laugh.The Holy Grail is Monty Python's best work,but Life of Brian is very close.I love all the hilarious random scenes,like when Brian falls into a alien spaceship,and it stuff like this that is reason why I love Monty Python,and 'Always Look On the Bright Side of Life' is one of my favourite movie songs of all time,it always cheers me up if i'm in a bad mood.Fans of Monty Python won't be disappointed by Life of Brian. Revolves around the life of Brian (Graham Chapman),a boy who was born the same night as Jesus Christ in a nearby stable and is mistaken for being the real messiah.

    How surprised am I that trite like this should end up in the IMDb top 250. Another boring 'comedy' from the stables of Monty Python. Please avoid this movie at all costs. The laughs come few and far between and at the most I managed a snicker. Story is (if you care, because its not about that) a boy is born to a man dressed up as a woman who shrieks all the time and gets on your nerves till they are stretched to the limits. As a matter of fact most of the characters in this movie squeal a lot to the effect that I almost thought that this is a move about pigs disguised as humans. So yeah Brian is born to a man dressed up as a woman on the same day as Christ in a stable adjacent to the stable where Christ is born. And Jesus Christ does it get worse from there. He grows up to hate the Romans and joins a group of liberalists who are plotting against the Romans. From there on Brian finds himself at the wrong place and the wrong time usually to eventually become a messiah of sorts to eventually be strung up for crucifixion to eventually sing his way into the sunset. The same people play different roles(you will see familiar faces playing multiple roles), you will notice the difference by the increase/decrease in pitch of their voice depending upon how irritating they are trying to be. I wasted 1.5 Hours of my life on this. You have been warned!

    Now, if you're a Jerry Lewis fan ( excepting the frogs for whom admiring is a way of re emasculating themselves after getting their ass's kicked for most of the 20th century ) or ye be a Three Stooge's fan no way this speaks to you. Yes, yes I know the AFI #1 comedy is that; " Some Like It Hot' OK, not bad, but aside from Marylin's incredible tush what did it really bring to the table comedy wise? Cross gender ? The Brits have been doing that for a 100 yrs. The rest of the movie, while well crafted and acted, is pretty predictable in it's construct. Now here is where AFI is chickenshit . "Life Of Brian" is not eligible , because it's not "American", yet one of their 'top 5' , "Dr. Strangelove" is, WHY ??? Both were produced in the UK. Kicker is, as I understand it, is that 'Brian' had no US distributor therefore made it ineligible for for 'AFI' consideration. ( Please correct if wrong ). Now, I'm gonna catch hell for this, but Monty's big cash cow 'Holy Grail', does nothing for me. OK, maybe the stage thing works ( I have not seen it ), but the movie didn't, not by a long shot. Pointless, Jerry Lewis spasmodic slapstick. I call your attention to the first 'Pink Panther' movie. While Sellers was not meant to be the focus of the movie ( there were many stars in it ) his bumbling inspector became a franchise. & in each following movie it became worser ( forget spellcheck, I know I'm leaving good grammar...as if I ever had ever had any..) It was in the first 'Panther ' , that the great Mr. Sellers, did his finest work of the series. Understood , he was doing slapstick, BUT, not over the top; Jerry Lewis, 3 Stooges , in your face stupid buffoonery, it was always in denial, & that's what made it great. ( OK a couple of bits may have been a push, but the rest; pillcrunching in the bathroom etc., you must give credit for the wonderful subtlety of his performance ). Well, that's where I am, humor in any form , only works if it is not an in your face farce, but has a wry edge. Preferably keenly sharp, intelligent, and to the bone. AND that is 'Life Of Brian'. (For the most part )

    It's worth noting right off the bat that I've never seen anything Monty Python before except for the Ministry of Silly Walks. No, not even Holy Grail. Yet. But I expected quite a bit from Life of Brian, seeing as the Pythons are some of the most revered comedians of all time. I was sadly disappointed. Life of Brian just never hit an exceptionally high, focused note. To start, the whole thing looks like a B- movie. It's as visually cheesy as a late 50's movie, and while the star of a comedy is its writing and delivery, the poor technical delivery is a major distraction. Then we move into the plot- I feel that Brian suffers from a poor plot that can't live up to its premise, if that makes sense. The initial scene, the manger next door, is a fantastic idea. The 'mistaken messiah' is genius. But the 'protesting Jews' that makes up half the film made me scratch my head- why? It's unfocused and the point is unclear, so I was always edgy and it distracted further from the comedy. Into the actual jokes themselves, some hit with me and others failed. The best parts of the film are Palin's "Biggus Dickus" questioning and the final scene, peaking with the Jewish Peole's Front Suicide Squad. The whole Messiah angle is made humorously relevant if you consider the idiots at Westboro Baptist. But there are jokes that flew over my head or just didn't register- a man in drag isn't a winner for me, and a strange, Otherworldly scene- which my parents told me was out of their TV series- made no sense. I was initially very sour about this film. It's most likely that there's a generation gap thing, although I do have a lack of affinity for comedies as a whole. Although even a day has been kind to this film- it's worth noting I felt the same way about Apocalypse Now when I first saw that, and that's another unfair comparison I've made with this film. I can't believe these two films were played beside each other in a theatre (or not, in Norway). Anyway, to parents wishing to show old comedies to the younger generation, don't start with this one. 7.3/10

    One of the sad things about organised religion, and I am not speaking about Christianity in particular here, is the lack of humor that many of them have. If God created the world and everything in it, then as a part of that creation came laughter, and I suspect that even the bible has good things about laughter, and the joy that such laughter brings. In many cases when I think about religion all I tend to see are sad and glum people, much like the flagellates, who forever whip themselves believing that by inflicting pain upon themselves they can bring themselves closer to God. I think the opposite is true though because in reality it is not pain that will bring you closer to God, but laughter. I guess the reason that many Christian fundamentalists are so offended with this movie is not that because it mocks Jesus, it doesn't, but because the film exposes to them what they really are, and the one thing people do not like is to have the truth exposed to them. In fact they wonder around like the three monkeys, covering their eyes, ears, and mouths, for fear that if they were to open them they will be opening themselves to the possibility of hell. However, truth be told, it is sad that many of these people live joyless lives with the hope of heaven only to discover that heaven has been denied to them. However there is one aspect of this film that I do believe that is incorrect, and that is the ex-leper. From my understanding of the gospels is that Jesus only healed people who wanted to be healed. In fact that is a theme that runs through all of these healing miracles, and that is the desire to be healed. It was not the case of Jesus popping up behind somebody and hey presto, they were healed. I am doubtful that anybody that wanted to be a leper would have ever actually been healed by Jesus (though it still made a very amusing scene, along with pretty much the rest of this film).

Pointless, Jerry Lewis spasmodic slapstick. I call your attention to the first 'Pink Panther' movie. While Sellers was not meant to be the focus of the movie ( there were many stars in it ) his bumbling inspector became a franchise. & in each following movie it became worser ( forget spellcheck, I know I'm leaving good grammar...as if I ever had ever had any..) It was in the first 'Panther ' , that the great Mr. Sellers, did his finest work of the series. Understood , he was doing slapstick, BUT, not over the top; Jerry Lewis, 3 Stooges , in your face stupid buffoonery, it was always in denial, & that's what made it great. ( OK a couple of bits may have been a push, but the rest; pillcrunching in the bathroom etc., you must give credit for the wonderful subtlety of his performance ). Well, that's where I am, humor in any form , only works if it is not an in your face farce, but has a wry edge. Preferably keenly sharp, intelligent, and to the bone. AND that is 'Life Of Brian'. (For the most part )

    It's worth noting right off the bat that I've never seen anything Monty Python before except for the Ministry of Silly Walks. No, not even Holy Grail. Yet. But I expected quite a bit from Life of Brian, seeing as the Pythons are some of the most revered comedians of all time. I was sadly disappointed. Life of Brian just never hit an exceptionally high, focused note. To start, the whole thing looks like a B- movie. It's as visually cheesy as a late 50's movie, and while the star of a comedy is its writing and delivery, the poor technical delivery is a major distraction. Then we move into the plot- I feel that Brian suffers from a poor plot that can't live up to its premise, if that makes sense. The initial scene, the manger next door, is a fantastic idea. The 'mistaken messiah' is genius. But the 'protesting Jews' that makes up half the film made me scratch my head- why? It's unfocused and the point is unclear, so I was always edgy and it distracted further from the comedy. Into the actual jokes themselves, some hit with me and others failed. The best parts of the film are Palin's "Biggus Dickus" questioning and the final scene, peaking with the Jewish Peole's Front Suicide Squad. The whole Messiah angle is made humorously relevant if you consider the idiots at Westboro Baptist. But there are jokes that flew over my head or just didn't register- a man in drag isn't a winner for me, and a strange, Otherworldly scene- which my parents told me was out of their TV series- made no sense. I was initially very sour about this film. It's most likely that there's a generation gap thing, although I do have a lack of affinity for comedies as a whole. Although even a day has been kind to this film- it's worth noting I felt the same way about Apocalypse Now when I first saw that, and that's another unfair comparison I've made with this film. I can't believe these two films were played beside each other in a theatre (or not, in Norway). Anyway, to parents wishing to show old comedies to the younger generation, don't start with this one. 7.3/10

    One of the sad things about organised religion, and I am not speaking about Christianity in particular here, is the lack of humor that many of them have. If God created the world and everything in it, then as a part of that creation came laughter, and I suspect that even the bible has good things about laughter, and the joy that such laughter brings. In many cases when I think about religion all I tend to see are sad and glum people, much like the flagellates, who forever whip themselves believing that by inflicting pain upon themselves they can bring themselves closer to God. I think the opposite is true though because in reality it is not pain that will bring you closer to God, but laughter. I guess the reason that many Christian fundamentalists are so offended with this movie is not that because it mocks Jesus, it doesn't, but because the film exposes to them what they really are, and the one thing people do not like is to have the truth exposed to them. In fact they wonder around like the three monkeys, covering their eyes, ears, and mouths, for fear that if they were to open them they will be opening themselves to the possibility of hell. However, truth be told, it is sad that many of these people live joyless lives with the hope of heaven only to discover that heaven has been denied to them. However there is one aspect of this film that I do believe that is incorrect, and that is the ex-leper. From my understanding of the gospels is that Jesus only healed people who wanted to be healed. In fact that is a theme that runs through all of these healing miracles, and that is the desire to be healed. It was not the case of Jesus popping up behind somebody and hey presto, they were healed. I am doubtful that anybody that wanted to be a leper would have ever actually been healed by Jesus (though it still made a very amusing scene, along with pretty much the rest of this film).

    Hilarious......no other word can describe this film! I've seen it many times and it still makes me laugh. It just is crazy and silly. enough so to make you laugh out loud! Yes there are some really weird bits including the alien spaceship out of nowhere....whats all that about? :P but hey it just keeps getting more and more stupidly funny. i would say a definite Nine out of ten. i wouldn't go for a ten out of ten because it isn't everybody's sort of film. but i wouldn't give it an eight because i still love it all the same. difficult one but a good film indeed. i wouldn't say its a must see though purely because it its not the kind of film that id show everyone or have a film night it with friends its not that kind of film. But i do like to express my view about it. Good film if you have got it but i wouldn't really buy it. A Definite 9/10 though no question! thanks for reading and happy reviewing :)

    This film is epic. While it doesn't contain as many jokes as The Holy Grail, it makes up by having a better story, way better in fact, and overall a much stronger overall sense of being a whole film, instead of a simple sequence of jokes. This finally magnifies the whole comedic experience of watching the film, since the jokes become stronger and it is more like a a film-length episode of Seinfeld, where the "main" joke is constructed during the whole length of the episode. This film is obligatory for someone who likes films, I would rank it as the third of the second greatest comedy ever made (the first is Dr. Strangelove, of course).

    Life of Brian, is a British comedy film written, directed and largely performed by the Monty Python comedy team that includes Graham Chapman,John Cleese,Terry Gilliam,Eric Idle,Terry Jones and Michael Palin. It tells the story of Brian Cohen,played by Graham Chapman, a young Jewish man who is born on the same day as, and next door to, Jesus Christ, and is subsequently mistaken for the Messiah.The film contains themes of religious satire that were controversial at the time of its release. On a midnight clear 2,000 years ago, three wise men enter a manger where a babe is wrapped in swaddling clothes. It is an infant called Brian...and the three wise men are in the wrong manger. For the rest of his life, Brian finds himself regarded as something of a messiah and yet he's always in the shadow of this other guy from Galilee. Brian is witness to the Sermon of the Mount, but his seat is in such a bad location that he can't hear any of it. Ultimately, he is brought before Pontius Pilate and sentenced to crucifixion, which takes place at that crowded, nonexclusive execution site a few blocks shy of Calvary. Rather than utter the Last Six Words, Brian leads his fellow crucifixees in a spirited rendition of a British music-hall cheer-up song "Always Look on the Bright Side of Life." The movie looked back 2000 years for its comic content, but was a decade ahead in provoking Christian controversy during its time of release.The historical lampoon of religious fanaticism may not be quite as hilarious as The Holy Grail but it's even more ambitious as it is far ahead of its time for it is a religious satire that does not target specific religions or religious leaders like, say, Jesus of Nazareth. Instead, it pokes fun at the mindless and fanatical among their followers which is an attack on religious zealotry and hypocrisy,which are things that that fellow from Nazareth didn't particularly care for either.Overall,it is one of the more cutting edge films of the 1970's for this religious farce from the classic comedy troupe is as poignant as it is funny and satirical.

    The Life of Brian is the second installment of the Monty Python films. And what a film it is. Probably one of the greatest comedy films in history. Life of Brian is as memorable as it is original. And I think there's more. I've seen all of Monty Python's films however I don't know much about him or anyone involved in the films. But I think that Life of Brian gives us a message. To Always Look on the Bright Side of Life. I don't think it's just a song at the end of the movie. I think it's a message. Because all of Monty Python's films are making fun of situations. Some frightening or dangerous situations. But the point is that it makes you happy(No doubt about that). It makes light of things. Which is how everyone should live their lives. Some religious people take it too seriously. I'm just saying to lay back and take a joke. This is coming from a raised Christian. The film isn't anti-Christian. It doesn't once mock Jesus or deny the existence of God. I'd say that this film has inspired me to look on the bright side of life no matter what. To be happy. This is a very funny and original comedy. It's a must see film which everyone should enjoy. Python's genius in comedy, returns for another equally great film.

    Possibly Monty Python's greatest work, 'Life of Brian' is a much controversial parody of Christianity. Brian, the main character, is born on the stable next door to Jesus; he joins an anti-Roman organization and ends up mistaken as a Messiah. From Jesus sermon on the mount all the way to crucifixion, many moments of Brian's life parallels those of Christ's. This movie is a rare combination of laugh-out-loud silly comedy, and highly intelligent satire; something only Monty Python knew how to do effectively. There's nearly no scene where jokes are not made, and yet the narrative flows perfectly. The Pythons are marvelous as always, with special mention to Terry Jones as Brian's mother (he was always at his best doing female characters), Graham Chapman as Brian, and Eric Idle in pretty much all of his roles. As a catholic, I had no trouble with the film. I'm not the church-going type, but I'm a firm believer in God, Jesus, Mary and the saints; yet, I have no problem with religious satire as long as it is smart and not just senselessly offensive. In truth, some of the funniest bits are exactly those revolving around Brian's following once he is mistaken as a prophet (and even HOW this mistake happened). People sanctifying everything of his, their extremist belief, his 'miracles', and their attacking at 'unbelievers'... It is hilarious, yet not wrong or unreal at all! Just the fact so many extremists got angry at the film and the whole controversy it caused are proof of the Pythons' point. Another great thing was the political satire in this. The whole (sub)plot about the anti-Roman activism was hilariously well done, and quite a jab at all the left-leaning 'revolutionaries' and 'freedom fighters' from all around the world. The altercation between the leader (John Cleese) and Stan/'Loretta' (Eric Idle), as well as a later meeting between the members (with the iconic 'What did the Romans ever do to us?' discussion) are memorable. Other remarkable moments: the animated (by Terry Gilliam) title sequence, the stoning, and the crucifixion. The ending, with Eric Idle singing 'Always Look on the Bright Side of Life', is great.

    Life of Brian is a fantastic movie with a surprisingly different and extremely risky storyline from the Monty Python crew and the six main cast members do a terrific job with all the wacky characters they play.Its without a doubt one of my favourite comedies,there's very few parts in this movie that don't make me laugh.The Holy Grail is Monty Python's best work,but Life of Brian is very close.I love all the hilarious random scenes,like when Brian falls into a alien spaceship,and it stuff like this that is reason why I love Monty Python,and 'Always Look On the Bright Side of Life' is one of my favourite movie songs of all time,it always cheers me up if i'm in a bad mood.Fans of Monty Python won't be disappointed by Life of Brian. Revolves around the life of Brian (Graham Chapman),a boy who was born the same night as Jesus Christ in a nearby stable and is mistaken for being the real messiah.

    How surprised am I that trite like this should end up in the IMDb top 250. Another boring 'comedy' from the stables of Monty Python. Please avoid this movie at all costs. The laughs come few and far between and at the most I managed a snicker. Story is (if you care, because its not about that) a boy is born to a man dressed up as a woman who shrieks all the time and gets on your nerves till they are stretched to the limits. As a matter of fact most of the characters in this movie squeal a lot to the effect that I almost thought that this is a move about pigs disguised as humans. So yeah Brian is born to a man dressed up as a woman on the same day as Christ in a stable adjacent to the stable where Christ is born. And Jesus Christ does it get worse from there. He grows up to hate the Romans and joins a group of liberalists who are plotting against the Romans. From there on Brian finds himself at the wrong place and the wrong time usually to eventually become a messiah of sorts to eventually be strung up for crucifixion to eventually sing his way into the sunset. The same people play different roles(you will see familiar faces playing multiple roles), you will notice the difference by the increase/decrease in pitch of their voice depending upon how irritating they are trying to be. I wasted 1.5 Hours of my life on this. You have been warned!

    Now, if you're a Jerry Lewis fan ( excepting the frogs for whom admiring is a way of re emasculating themselves after getting their ass's kicked for most of the 20th century ) or ye be a Three Stooge's fan no way this speaks to you. Yes, yes I know the AFI #1 comedy is that; " Some Like It Hot' OK, not bad, but aside from Marylin's incredible tush what did it really bring to the table comedy wise? Cross gender ? The Brits have been doing that for a 100 yrs. The rest of the movie, while well crafted and acted, is pretty predictable in it's construct. Now here is where AFI is chickenshit . "Life Of Brian" is not eligible , because it's not "American", yet one of their 'top 5' , "Dr. Strangelove" is, WHY ??? Both were produced in the UK. Kicker is, as I understand it, is that 'Brian' had no US distributor therefore made it ineligible for for 'AFI' consideration. ( Please correct if wrong ). Now, I'm gonna catch hell for this, but Monty's big cash cow 'Holy Grail', does nothing for me. OK, maybe the stage thing works ( I have not seen it ), but the movie didn't, not by a long shot.
