 <sinopse>
  Two over-loyal Celtic fans kidnap their opponent's star player in order to guarantee their team the championship.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  The National Basketball Association play-offs are taking place, and the Boston Celtics are facing the Utah Jazz in a crucial series. This is also the last year that any games will be played in the Boston Garden, which is going to be torn down after the end of the season. Mike and Jimmy, two die-hard sports fans who will risk anything for the Celtics to win, are really getting into the games. The Celtics would be a sure win if it weren't for Lewis Scott, the cocky, loud-mouth star of the Jazz. After Scott himself punishes the Celtics in a bad loss, Mike and Jimmy decide to take things into their own hands by kidnaping Scott and holding him until after the crucial game takes place.

    Celtic Pride is essentially a one note comedy film, yet the pairing of two likable comedy men, an original plot, and some heavy jokes make this film more than average. This is a different kind of sports comedy where the excitement isn't coming from the players, but two rabid fans of the Boston Celtics. Dan Akroyd and Daniel Stern play Mike and Jimmy, two hardcore fans of the Boston Celtics. The Celts are in the finals with the Utah Jazz and their star player selfish, ballhog Lewis Scott (Wayans). After losing game six, it's on to game seven where either the Celts or the Jazz will become the champions. So Mike and Jimmy go to a nightclub after the game, and get drunk with Scott, before they wake up in Mike's basement with him tied up, and no recollection of the events that took place the night before. Mike and Jimmy find out from their cop-buddy (Guilfoyle) that kidnapping is kidnapping no matter what time they let the victim go. So they think they should show something for it, and hold Lewis till after game seven so the Celts have a good shot of winning. Their plan goes awry when the cad starts playing mind-games with the two in order to disassemble their longtime friendship. This is one of the comedies you have to search under the bed for. Even with Akroyd, Stern, and Wayans on the cover this film is usually lost in the dust compared to Akroyd's others like The Great Outdoors and Ghostbusters. This isn't better than those two works of comedic gold, but they do present the same feel-good aspect and have a warm, fuzzy, classic feeling to them. The pairing of Dan Akroyd and Daniel Stern wasn't unlikely at the time, and they do a good job at being the two buddies. The funniest stuff is from Damon though as he continues to play games with Mike's head saying that "you're his bitch" and consistently taunts him. Thankfully, the movie isn't just made up of these games because if it was, I don't think we could call this a buddy comedy. Now that it's 2011, I was surprised to see Judd Apatow's name all over this film as producer, story creator, and writer. The current generation knows Apatow for making heartfelt, with an essence of raunch and silly comedy-drama premises. In the nineties, he was more about the laughs than the drama. Celtic Pride can also serve as a time capsule of a different time in a film-maker's life. Celtic Pride doesn't over-shoot or overstay its welcome. It runs for a comfortable ninety-one minutes, and it goes by quickly. A different side of sports comedies adding flavor and a good amount of heart, Celtic Pride has green and white blood pumping thru its veins. Starring: Dan Akroyd, Daniel Stern, and Damon Wayans. Directed by: Tom DeCerhio.

    Celtic pride: I think that the tittle means everything about the film. Two Boston Celtic fans doing what ever it takes for their teem to win. Even if it means kidnapping the enemy. This movie is for Celtic fans especially. Lary Bird, Robert Parish, Kevin Mchale, Dennis Johnson, and Danny Ainge the best starting 5 that was ever put together are not it but it's still a good representation of die hard Celtic fans. Dan Aykroyd is the man possibly the best comedian that ever lived. It goes back to 1975 on Saturday Nigt Live in its early prime years Elwood Blues, Mr. Conehead, Fred Garvmen Male prostitute, and more. on the show e=h e proved he was the funniest man of the 70's, 80's and 90's He also made a good New England sports fans Celtics and Bruins, and with his awesome voices he does an awesome imitation of Marv Albert. This is a movie for a New England comedy fan.

    Dan Ackroyd and Daniel Stern are two die-hard Celtic fans. When their superstitions begin to fail and the Celtics lose, they devise a plan to kidnap the star player of the Utah Jazz (Damon Wayans). Then it's hi-jinx of an unprecedented proportion. No, that's a lie... it's just another bad film. Daniel Stern has never been a strong actor. He's still best known as the guy from "Home Alone" (besides Joe Pesci) who gets the tar beat out of him. He will never live that down, especially making disposable films like this. Dan Ackroyd is hit and miss, making some brilliant films ("Ghostbusters", "Gross Pointe Blank") and some really stupid films ("Coneheads"). This one is a miss. Maybe in Canada this sort of thing passes as comedy, but where I come from this is the equivalent of a producer flushes a few million dollars down a toilet after lighting it on fire. And Mr. Wayans... with a long track record of making horrible films that are supposed to appeal to the youth market, particularly in the urban sector. You might impress teenage girls with a serious drug habit and failing grades in English, but you're not convincing me. I would be hard pressed to find one Wayns film that I could actually consider pretty decent. That's all you need to know about this movie: it has these guys. If you agree with my opinion of them, you'll agree the movie is a waste of time. If you think I'm being too harsh, give the movie a chance. But friends shouldn't make friends watch "Celtic Pride". It's so much worse than "Juwanna Mann".

    As a Celtic fan for a number of years, I was looking forward to this film, only to be a victim of the filmworld's incredible bias. This tape got slammed-dunked in the garbage pail, where it belongs. I was totally offended at Dan Ackroyd making several out-and-out extremely bigoted anti-Christian statements, designed for cheap laughs that would never be permitted had he been denigrating any other religion or race or group. If that wasn't enough, we get a guy holding a sign with Scripture reference acting rude and then getting beat up....for laughs again. Incredible. This movie doesn't stop there. We also see a black guy yelling racist remarks that a white person would never get away with saying, and rightly so.....but in Hollywood, these double standards still exist. It turns out the only funny thing in the movie was the parody of fans who take sports too seriously. That was the idea behind the story, so why all the religious cheap shots?

    1st, everyone keeps dissing the Celtic Pride film. I think the movie was a 3 1/2 out of 5 stars. I am a Boston fan but still look at it as if i weren't. What other team has made a movie? Not one, celtics are legendary for there championships over the years. Anyhow Damon Waynes, a (very good actor) did keep the movie funny with his rude comments, and Dan Akyroid and Daniel Stern(very good actors) did there part to play the role of washed up, lazy, full time sports fans dedicated to the game. The movie however no one wanted to see which makes me ponder would people wanna see it if the movie was about another team. My friend made fun of it, but then accually watched it and said "that movies wasn't bad at all" he laughed so many times. Its a good comedy, give the movie a chance, don't hate... on something great... I give my love to the director, he took a chance, i think he did the best he could for this movie.

    Celtic Pride is a good example of a movie that is doomed to go straight to video and cable. Although it did play in selected theaters, the public wasn't aware of the movie until it found itself on the shelves at the local video store. The idea about the Boston Celtics and the Garden is great. Then again, the idea alone is not going to carry a movie. Damon Wayans, Daniel Stern and Dan Aykroyd star in a movie that is only half funny. To say this is a great comedy is a mouthful. A nice movie with some laughs, sure, but overall, the movie falls short for anything timeless. Stern and Aykroyd are good actors but are not stars. They alone can not carry a film. While Wayans is one of the only funny things about the movie, the story fails to have him as a major part to the story. Stern and Aykroyd are good supporting actors when they team up with other actor like Billy Crystal and Chevy Chase. Alone, or even together, they do not have the chemistry that makes comedy teams. A nice little movie that can be found in the bargain bin and the video store or on cable television at 2 o'clock in the morning.

    Damon Wayans, Dan Aykroyd & Daniel Stern work really well together in this mild comedy, i got this on DVD for like $9 Canadian when i was visiting there in 2001 & it's certainly money well spent. Two Boston Celtic nutty fans really want the Celtics to win so they kidnap the star player of opposition team the Lewis Scott of the Utah Jazz. Don't worry about the cheesy comments for this movie, trust me its a lot better than movies such as Bushwacked, Marci X & Coneheads, each one of this movies contain one of the 3 main stars of this movie. You can even watch this with the family, I don't recall any rude scenes or any fowl language. Slightly better than the average movie. Daniel Stern & Dan Aykroyd are really funny together. The overall mark for this movie i would give is an 8 / 10. Recommended to anyone who likes sport comedies such as Rookie of the year, The Sandlot Kids & The replacements.

    Two die-hard Boston Celtic fans go out of their way to mess up the star player before game 7 of the Finals, and then accidently kidnap him. Not deep, but it doesn't have to be. A movie that a good sports fan would find as humorous, but a movie fan would only find forgetable. Akroyd, Stern, and Wayans all turn in entertaining performances, but the true star of the movie is.... Christopher McDonald. He made me laugh my head off with the "Uhhhhhhh I hate my life" line. Akroyd doing the "Shakacon" thing was hillarious, as was his dream. Overall, it was enjoyable, but proceed with caution. ***+(3.5)/*****(5).

    Jimmy is so obsessed with sports that while he is doing a plumbing job, he takes a break to watch a Bruins game and when the rich man demands he finish the job, Jimmy asks him to hold it. Mike is also obsessed, because he ended up a gym teacher rather than having a pro basketball career. He scares the kids at his school, and his wife Carol wants him out of the house. The devoted Celtics fans go to what may be the last game in the arena before its demolition, the game that could win their team the NBA championship. But the Celtics lose, despite all of Jimmy's and Mike's efforts--switching seats depending on whether the game is even or odd, and depending on which half it is. Demanding that a man who arrived during halftime leave because the Celtics have been playing poorly since he got there. Even persuading the fans to spread out and leave them the only ones in their section of the arena. There's only one way to make sure the Celtics win the final game: when they see Utah Jazz star Lewis Scott drinking in a bar, they pretend to be fans and persuade him to get drunk so he won't be at his best for the game. That plan doesn't go as well as hoped, and the results are hilarious. Damon Wayans was great as the conceited Lewis, especially in a Nike commercial satirizing Charles Barkley's comments about not wanting to be a role model (the commercial was later parodied in a funny dream where Jimmy was a celebrated plumber). He considered Jimmy and Mike to be a couple of losers who weren't worth anything, and because he had the talent, he was entitled to whatever he had, and they were entitled to nothing. Dan Aykroyd was okay as Jimmy, but you couldn't tell from this that he ever got an Oscar nomination. Daniel Stern started out terrible as Mike but got better. The overall results were good if you just want to watch a fun movie without caring whether anyone has talent. Possible Spoiler: Larry Bird walked up as the guys were making a big deal over Lewis, and it was so painful for these obsessed Celtics fans to have to pretend in front of possibly the greatest Celtics player ever--making Bird ashamed! DEFINITE SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Once Lewis is allowed to go back to his team, he promises not to turn the guys in for kidnapping if they promise to root for him and his team. The final game is the best part of the movie!

    Pointless comedy about two big time Celtics fans kidnapping a star player (Wayans, who could only post up Spud Webb or Muggsy Bogues). Not good, but we don't really make basketball movies with an eye towards the Scottish market.

Even persuading the fans to spread out and leave them the only ones in their section of the arena. There's only one way to make sure the Celtics win the final game: when they see Utah Jazz star Lewis Scott drinking in a bar, they pretend to be fans and persuade him to get drunk so he won't be at his best for the game. That plan doesn't go as well as hoped, and the results are hilarious. Damon Wayans was great as the conceited Lewis, especially in a Nike commercial satirizing Charles Barkley's comments about not wanting to be a role model (the commercial was later parodied in a funny dream where Jimmy was a celebrated plumber). He considered Jimmy and Mike to be a couple of losers who weren't worth anything, and because he had the talent, he was entitled to whatever he had, and they were entitled to nothing. Dan Aykroyd was okay as Jimmy, but you couldn't tell from this that he ever got an Oscar nomination. Daniel Stern started out terrible as Mike but got better. The overall results were good if you just want to watch a fun movie without caring whether anyone has talent. Possible Spoiler: Larry Bird walked up as the guys were making a big deal over Lewis, and it was so painful for these obsessed Celtics fans to have to pretend in front of possibly the greatest Celtics player ever--making Bird ashamed! DEFINITE SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Once Lewis is allowed to go back to his team, he promises not to turn the guys in for kidnapping if they promise to root for him and his team. The final game is the best part of the movie!

    Pointless comedy about two big time Celtics fans kidnapping a star player (Wayans, who could only post up Spud Webb or Muggsy Bogues). Not good, but we don't really make basketball movies with an eye towards the Scottish market.

    Celtic Pride is essentially a one note comedy film, yet the pairing of two likable comedy men, an original plot, and some heavy jokes make this film more than average. This is a different kind of sports comedy where the excitement isn't coming from the players, but two rabid fans of the Boston Celtics. Dan Akroyd and Daniel Stern play Mike and Jimmy, two hardcore fans of the Boston Celtics. The Celts are in the finals with the Utah Jazz and their star player selfish, ballhog Lewis Scott (Wayans). After losing game six, it's on to game seven where either the Celts or the Jazz will become the champions. So Mike and Jimmy go to a nightclub after the game, and get drunk with Scott, before they wake up in Mike's basement with him tied up, and no recollection of the events that took place the night before. Mike and Jimmy find out from their cop-buddy (Guilfoyle) that kidnapping is kidnapping no matter what time they let the victim go. So they think they should show something for it, and hold Lewis till after game seven so the Celts have a good shot of winning. Their plan goes awry when the cad starts playing mind-games with the two in order to disassemble their longtime friendship. This is one of the comedies you have to search under the bed for. Even with Akroyd, Stern, and Wayans on the cover this film is usually lost in the dust compared to Akroyd's others like The Great Outdoors and Ghostbusters. This isn't better than those two works of comedic gold, but they do present the same feel-good aspect and have a warm, fuzzy, classic feeling to them. The pairing of Dan Akroyd and Daniel Stern wasn't unlikely at the time, and they do a good job at being the two buddies. The funniest stuff is from Damon though as he continues to play games with Mike's head saying that "you're his bitch" and consistently taunts him. Thankfully, the movie isn't just made up of these games because if it was, I don't think we could call this a buddy comedy. Now that it's 2011, I was surprised to see Judd Apatow's name all over this film as producer, story creator, and writer. The current generation knows Apatow for making heartfelt, with an essence of raunch and silly comedy-drama premises. In the nineties, he was more about the laughs than the drama. Celtic Pride can also serve as a time capsule of a different time in a film-maker's life. Celtic Pride doesn't over-shoot or overstay its welcome. It runs for a comfortable ninety-one minutes, and it goes by quickly. A different side of sports comedies adding flavor and a good amount of heart, Celtic Pride has green and white blood pumping thru its veins. Starring: Dan Akroyd, Daniel Stern, and Damon Wayans. Directed by: Tom DeCerhio.

    Celtic pride: I think that the tittle means everything about the film. Two Boston Celtic fans doing what ever it takes for their teem to win. Even if it means kidnapping the enemy. This movie is for Celtic fans especially. Lary Bird, Robert Parish, Kevin Mchale, Dennis Johnson, and Danny Ainge the best starting 5 that was ever put together are not it but it's still a good representation of die hard Celtic fans. Dan Aykroyd is the man possibly the best comedian that ever lived. It goes back to 1975 on Saturday Nigt Live in its early prime years Elwood Blues, Mr. Conehead, Fred Garvmen Male prostitute, and more. on the show e=h e proved he was the funniest man of the 70's, 80's and 90's He also made a good New England sports fans Celtics and Bruins, and with his awesome voices he does an awesome imitation of Marv Albert. This is a movie for a New England comedy fan.

    Dan Ackroyd and Daniel Stern are two die-hard Celtic fans. When their superstitions begin to fail and the Celtics lose, they devise a plan to kidnap the star player of the Utah Jazz (Damon Wayans). Then it's hi-jinx of an unprecedented proportion. No, that's a lie... it's just another bad film. Daniel Stern has never been a strong actor. He's still best known as the guy from "Home Alone" (besides Joe Pesci) who gets the tar beat out of him. He will never live that down, especially making disposable films like this. Dan Ackroyd is hit and miss, making some brilliant films ("Ghostbusters", "Gross Pointe Blank") and some really stupid films ("Coneheads"). This one is a miss. Maybe in Canada this sort of thing passes as comedy, but where I come from this is the equivalent of a producer flushes a few million dollars down a toilet after lighting it on fire. And Mr. Wayans... with a long track record of making horrible films that are supposed to appeal to the youth market, particularly in the urban sector. You might impress teenage girls with a serious drug habit and failing grades in English, but you're not convincing me. I would be hard pressed to find one Wayns film that I could actually consider pretty decent. That's all you need to know about this movie: it has these guys. If you agree with my opinion of them, you'll agree the movie is a waste of time. If you think I'm being too harsh, give the movie a chance. But friends shouldn't make friends watch "Celtic Pride". It's so much worse than "Juwanna Mann".

    As a Celtic fan for a number of years, I was looking forward to this film, only to be a victim of the filmworld's incredible bias. This tape got slammed-dunked in the garbage pail, where it belongs. I was totally offended at Dan Ackroyd making several out-and-out extremely bigoted anti-Christian statements, designed for cheap laughs that would never be permitted had he been denigrating any other religion or race or group. If that wasn't enough, we get a guy holding a sign with Scripture reference acting rude and then getting beat up....for laughs again. Incredible. This movie doesn't stop there. We also see a black guy yelling racist remarks that a white person would never get away with saying, and rightly so.....but in Hollywood, these double standards still exist. It turns out the only funny thing in the movie was the parody of fans who take sports too seriously. That was the idea behind the story, so why all the religious cheap shots?

    1st, everyone keeps dissing the Celtic Pride film. I think the movie was a 3 1/2 out of 5 stars. I am a Boston fan but still look at it as if i weren't. What other team has made a movie? Not one, celtics are legendary for there championships over the years. Anyhow Damon Waynes, a (very good actor) did keep the movie funny with his rude comments, and Dan Akyroid and Daniel Stern(very good actors) did there part to play the role of washed up, lazy, full time sports fans dedicated to the game. The movie however no one wanted to see which makes me ponder would people wanna see it if the movie was about another team. My friend made fun of it, but then accually watched it and said "that movies wasn't bad at all" he laughed so many times. Its a good comedy, give the movie a chance, don't hate... on something great... I give my love to the director, he took a chance, i think he did the best he could for this movie.

    Celtic Pride is a good example of a movie that is doomed to go straight to video and cable. Although it did play in selected theaters, the public wasn't aware of the movie until it found itself on the shelves at the local video store. The idea about the Boston Celtics and the Garden is great. Then again, the idea alone is not going to carry a movie. Damon Wayans, Daniel Stern and Dan Aykroyd star in a movie that is only half funny. To say this is a great comedy is a mouthful. A nice movie with some laughs, sure, but overall, the movie falls short for anything timeless. Stern and Aykroyd are good actors but are not stars. They alone can not carry a film. While Wayans is one of the only funny things about the movie, the story fails to have him as a major part to the story. Stern and Aykroyd are good supporting actors when they team up with other actor like Billy Crystal and Chevy Chase. Alone, or even together, they do not have the chemistry that makes comedy teams. A nice little movie that can be found in the bargain bin and the video store or on cable television at 2 o'clock in the morning.

    Damon Wayans, Dan Aykroyd & Daniel Stern work really well together in this mild comedy, i got this on DVD for like $9 Canadian when i was visiting there in 2001 & it's certainly money well spent. Two Boston Celtic nutty fans really want the Celtics to win so they kidnap the star player of opposition team the Lewis Scott of the Utah Jazz. Don't worry about the cheesy comments for this movie, trust me its a lot better than movies such as Bushwacked, Marci X & Coneheads, each one of this movies contain one of the 3 main stars of this movie. You can even watch this with the family, I don't recall any rude scenes or any fowl language. Slightly better than the average movie. Daniel Stern & Dan Aykroyd are really funny together. The overall mark for this movie i would give is an 8 / 10. Recommended to anyone who likes sport comedies such as Rookie of the year, The Sandlot Kids & The replacements.

    Two die-hard Boston Celtic fans go out of their way to mess up the star player before game 7 of the Finals, and then accidently kidnap him. Not deep, but it doesn't have to be. A movie that a good sports fan would find as humorous, but a movie fan would only find forgetable. Akroyd, Stern, and Wayans all turn in entertaining performances, but the true star of the movie is.... Christopher McDonald. He made me laugh my head off with the "Uhhhhhhh I hate my life" line. Akroyd doing the "Shakacon" thing was hillarious, as was his dream. Overall, it was enjoyable, but proceed with caution. ***+(3.5)/*****(5).

    Jimmy is so obsessed with sports that while he is doing a plumbing job, he takes a break to watch a Bruins game and when the rich man demands he finish the job, Jimmy asks him to hold it. Mike is also obsessed, because he ended up a gym teacher rather than having a pro basketball career. He scares the kids at his school, and his wife Carol wants him out of the house. The devoted Celtics fans go to what may be the last game in the arena before its demolition, the game that could win their team the NBA championship. But the Celtics lose, despite all of Jimmy's and Mike's efforts--switching seats depending on whether the game is even or odd, and depending on which half it is. Demanding that a man who arrived during halftime leave because the Celtics have been playing poorly since he got there. Even persuading the fans to spread out and leave them the only ones in their section of the arena.
