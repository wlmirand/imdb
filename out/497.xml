 <sinopse>
  While trying to secure a $1 million donation for his museum, a befuddled paleontologist is pursued by a flighty and often irritating heiress and her pet leopard "Baby."
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Mild mannered zoology professor Dr. David Huxley is excited by the news that an intercostal clavicle bone has been found to complete his brontosaurus skeleton, a project four years in the construction. He is equally excited about his imminent marriage to his assistant, the officious Alice Swallow, who is interested in him more for his work than for him as a person. David needs the $1 million endowment of wealthy dowager Mrs. Carleton Random to complete the project. Her lawyer, Alexander Peabody, will make the decision on her behalf, so David needs to get in his favor. However, whenever David tries to make a good impression on Peabody, the same young woman always seems to do something to make him look bad. She is the flighty heiress Susan Vance. The more David wants Susan to go away, the more Susan seems not to want or be able to. But David eventually learns that Alexander Peabody is her good friend, who she calls Boopy, and Susan's Aunt Elizabeth, with whom David has also made a bad ...

    There are a lot of films from the 1930s and 1940s that are incorrectly referred to a screwball comedies. This film ought to almost be considered the textbook example of a screwball comedy. Unfortunately, Howard Hawks, the director, didn't even quite get his own film! He though it didn't work because there were no normal characters in the film...which exactly makes it a screwball comedy. Think of our two main characters. Cary Grant who is a brilliant scientist with very few social skills. Katherine Hepburn who has no intellectual prowess whatsoever, but who has oodles of social skills, though they are a bit unusual. A perfect pairing. Then you have Hepburn's aunt, who now owns a leopard as a pet...who is running after Charles Ruggles, a big game hunter (of sorts). And then you have dinosaur bones versus a dog. What more do you need for a screwball comedy? One of the funniest scenes in film is in this movie -- where Katerine Hepburn's dress falls apart, and he covers it up first with his top hat, and then with his own body...as they walk through a ritzy restaurant! This comedic role is one of Grant's best. His acrobatic/athletic skills fit some of the slapstick perfectly, and his general demeanor is what you never see in any other Cary Grant role. Hepburn reportedly had a lot of difficulty with the comedy, but she comes across well as an almost total airhead. The primary supporting cast is terrific -- May Robson as the eccentric aunt, Charles Ruggles good as the big-game hunter, and a couple of great scenes with veteran comic actor Walter Catlett as a constable. You'll briefly see some other faces -- Ward Bond, and Barry Fitzgerald has a small part. Most every scene in this film made me at least smile, and a few times I laughed out loud, and that's something I rarely do. I wasn't thrilled with the swinging ladder scene at the close of the movie. That was just stupid, and they could have gotten to the same conclusion with something that would have seemed more realistically possible. But, overall, the movie's a gem...a true screwball comedy.

    Animals play a significant role in Bringing Up Baby, not just in terms of adding to comic situations, but also operating as metaphors for l'amour fou (crazy love). When we first meet him, palaeontologist David Huxley (Grant) is preparing to marry his co-worker Alice Swallow (Walker). Alice, we learn, is a rational, no-nonsense woman who sees marriage as a convenient and rational transaction rather than as an expression of love. As the film opens, David and Alice are putting the final touches on a brontosaurus skeleton that he has been working on for five years. The skeleton seems to be a symbol of the couple's relationship - dry, brittle, tenuous, old and, most importantly, dead. Enter Susan Vance (Hepburn), whose wild anarchic nature is just what the doctor ordered. She seems, on the surface, hair-brained - and this may be true - but her ditziness is the result of being absolutely, utterly, ridiculously head-over-heals in love (at first sight, as is the case with most l'amour fou scenarios) with David and doing whatever she can to sabotage his plans to marry Alice. Susan's leopard, named Baby, is the symbol of her love for David, for the moment the leopard lays its eyes on him, it is instantly affectionate and follows him around, just as Susan does. Jittery David is, of course, terrified of the beast and all that it represents. The leopard becomes an increasingly useful symbol as the film continues. At her aunt's estate in Connecticut, Susan releases another leopard its cage, thinking it is Baby captured by zoo officials when in fact it is a rogue leopard from the circus on its way to be gassed after attacking someone. With two leopards on the loose, the analogy becomes unmistakable - the wild leopard that Susan releases is David's libido, free at last after being repressed for so long in a loveless relationship. Indeed, towards the end of the film, when the wild leopard traps the host of characters in the local jail, it is nervous, terrified David who steps up and boldly saves the day. This I suppose is just one way of reading and enjoying a film like Bringing Up Baby. i think it's interesting that the film announces its interested in exploring psychoanalysis with the inclusion of a character who is a Freudian therapist (Dr Lehman played by Fritz Feld). Psychoanalysis was, of course, very popular among Hollywood screenwriters between the 30s and 50s who adopted all manner of coded symbols for sex after Joseph Breen's Production Code so tightly reasserted control over what could and couldn't be represented on screen. But the fact that Dr Lehman's diagnoses are so far off tells us that the science of the mind is no match for the power of l'amour fou, which turns men and women into wild, irrational carnal beasts.

    Screwball Comedy finds in "Bringing Up Baby" one its most better-represented manifestos, and one its most classic ad pure incarnations. Starring Hollywood icons Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn, the film was directed by Howard Hawks, one of the most eclectic American directors, as he worked on movies of all kinds, from Gangsters to Westerns To Comedies. Arguably, "Bringing Up Baby" is the culmination of the comedic side of his career. David Huxley is a paleontologist trying to convince the lawyer of a rich woman, who will be giving away one million dollars, to give the money to his museum. Huxley in the meantime meets by chance a charmingly goofy woman, Susan, whom he doesn't like. But she in secret falls immediately for the man, and unintentionally makes his life hell as an excuse to have him close by: the morning after they meet, she calls for his help because in her apartment she has a leopard, which however is domesticated and causes really no harm. One clever plot scheme after the other brings the two into the home of Susan's aunt in Connecticut, who coincidentally (!) is the woman who is giving away the one million dollars. Since Huxley has already made a fool of himself in front of her, he tries to hide his true identity (with Susan's help), for the sake of the museum. Meanwhile, the leopard escapes. On one hand, it's a typical Hollywood film with improbable scenarios and perfectly adorable characters. One the other, it's a movie with the charm and wit of only the best of 1930's comedies; a faithful document of the time when "low-brow" humor meant slapstick and innocent silliness, instead of vulgarity and utter stupidity. But the story twists are so many and so cleverly assembled together that it's hardly low-brow comedy at all. After this, Hawks went further down his comedic career with the other big classic of his "His Girl Friday", also starring Grant.

    By design-of-nature and my environment of upbringing, I incline to keep a sensible mind with regard of viewing films, so when a screwball comedy goes it its extreme with uper-rapid pace and madcap characters, it is pretty understandable why initially this Howard Hawks film bombed tragically by its acceptance both commercially and critic-wisely, albeit Grant and Hepburn's dedicative endeavor, a well-crafted film script and its astonishing achievement of the animal (a leopard and a dog) performance (credits to their trainers as well). But now generally hailed as a paragon comedy by consensus, I wonder maybe I was born in a wrong era. I am not saying I dislike the film, it is a tongue-in-cheek urban tale which generates unsolicited laughters abound, but the off-putting disposition of Hepburn's Susan does impede me from fully appreciating this work. The story is a straight arrow zoology professor David (Grant) meets a scatterbrain wealthy girl Susan, who is inexplicably smitten with him, they first met in a golf field and without any context, once Susan sets her eyes on him, she is playing all the manipulative tricks to keep David from getting married and as stereotyped as it sounds, after a succession of zany slapsticks (mainly concerns finding a pet leopard and a barking dog), the two prove they really deserve each other. Grant is quite proficient in his usual orbit of a harmless gentleman with a double chin, plagued by laughter-induced mishaps when he is die hard trying to procure a million dollar donation for his museum, inconveniently the benefactor turns out to be Susan's auntie (Robson). Hepburn, never exemplifies herself as an excellent comedian, makes a great effort to match Grant's comic timing with her hotheaded whimsy, but the result is rather a hyperbole than a substantial stretch. Supporting players are basically expendable, Charles Ruggles' hunting-drivel-talking leopard-growl-mimicking dinner guest is the essence of what a bore a bourgeois boffin could be, and for whom we should all weep. Hawks manages to show off some camera artifices to shot the scenes between human cast and the carnivore feline, it is still magically done although we all witnessed the CGI tiger in LIFE OF PI (2012, 10/10) with awe and amazement, I suggest a remake with swapped sex, a well-heeled young man possessed with a priggish female zoologist, I doubt anyone could take the challenge, sex equality is still a halfway deal, and it goes without saying there will be a slew of CGI beasts around them.

    This is one of those films that you must re-visit perhaps once a year, because in spite of its place in Hollywood as a legendary failure (that resulted in Katharine Hepburn being listed as box office poison), it is one of the 10 funniest movies ever made. Hepburn and Cary Grant are an opposite sex version of Laurel and Hardy here, so dumb they're smart, and so over-the-top, you can't get enough of them. Grant is an expert on dinosaurs, and is missing the one important tail bone he needs to complete a 10-year project. That bone will go missing, thanks to George, a spunky pooch (who happens to look like Nick and Nora Charles' dog Asta) who grabs it then gets distracted by playing with a lovable leopard named Baby. If George and Baby weren't enough to drive Grant to wish he was extinct like the dinosaurs, then Hepburn might, yet there is something about this dizzy heiress that makes him remember that he's a man, not a bone chaser. O.K., I admit that I would be greatly annoyed to be stalked by a character as wacko and interfering as Hepburn, but watching Grant deal with her is a delightfully witty voyage. From the moment she steals his golf ball, dents his car, then tears his tuxedo jacket, you know she's attached to him like glue to a Popsicle stick. And when he accidentally retaliates and rips her dress, that sticky situation leads to even more. They are not quite the only insane ones here. Everybody has some neurotic disorder about them, even the psychiatrist (Fritz Feld) whom Hepburn and Grant encounter in a fancy restaurant and later in the country where Baby has taken up temporary residence on Feld's roof. May Robson is perplexed from the moment she sees Grant wearing a frilly ladies' robe, and Charles Ruggles adds more befuddlement into the mix when he shows up. A dipsomaniac caretaker (Barry Fitzgerald), frustrated sheriff (Walter Catlett) and Grant's jilted fianc&eacute;e (Tala Birell) are others involved in this mix, which also includes a second leopard whom even Baby might run from if they were to encounter each other in the dark. Director Howard Hawks mixes everything together seamlessly, resulting in a film of sheer perfection. Why this flopped in its initial release has never really been identified, except perhaps that Hepburn's involvement in a comedy after so many serious dramas seemed like something to skip as a misguided shot in the dark. She really proves her meddle in comedy when she pretends to be a gangster's moll, utilizing an accent that is downright hysterical. But the movie audiences in 1938 would have to wait for its rediscovery later on, and like so many other films, this one has risen above its initial failure to become one of the all-time classics, a pleasure from start to finish. Peter Bogdanovich's "What's Up Doc?" pretty much updated the plot, replacing the two leopards with identical suitcases, yet utilizing the same ensemble types of wackos to make it almost equally as enjoyable and one of the best modern comedy classics.

    if you believe than all "30 years comedies are same fruit basket, you are wrong. if you see Katherine Hepburn only as feminism icon, you make a great mistake. because this film is out of ordinaries rules. a great, amazing, chaotic, seductive comedy. out of expectations, full of flavor of its period but, in same time, real special. it is an adorable surprise. nothing more. a man, a woman and a lot of crazy adventures. entertainment but, in same measure, a story of love with different bricks and spices. it has something from Russian comedies but, in same time, it respects the law of Hollywood. a precise chaos. that is it. like a firework. or, only, like a splendid birthday cake.

    Directed by one of the golden age's most prolific directors and featuring two of its biggest stars, Howard Hawks' Bringing Up Baby (1938) tells the story of David (Cary Grant), a paleontologist who's led into a series of zany events by the wild and bubbly Susan (Rita Hayworth). The bare-bones plot involves David having to retrieve a dinosaur bone for his museum from Susan's dog while the two try to manage Susan's pet leopard (the titular "Baby"). Presented via Hawk's trademark dry and no-frills directing style, Bringing Up Baby is an often funny but ultimately grating experience. The film has some great positives; it really shines in a few stand-out comedic scenes. One sees David attempting to save an ignorant Susan from embarrassment in a restaurant, and another an awkward dinner table scene that makes perfect use of dramatic irony for hilarious effect. Each of these scenes are meticulously crafted and extremely entertaining in their own right. To many critics, the film's box infamous office failure remains something of an enigma. Despite extremely positive reception from test screenings, the film failed to make its budget back during its initial run. Hawks himself felt the film "had a great fault and I learned an awful lot from that. There were no normal people in it. Everyone you met was a screwball and since that time I have learned my lesson and I don't intend ever again to make everybody crazy". I agree. There isn't a single relatable feature in any of the film's characters, and as a result it feels emotionally void. We're supposed to believe that the gawky David needs the irresponsible Susan to show him how to have fun, and that Susan needs a man to marry, but the lack of any emotional investment means the film plays out unconvincingly and the plot feels simply set up in order to allow for crazy antics to happen. This isn't helped by the movie's cut-throat pace, which, while moving things along quickly, leaves little room for character and story development, and little breathing room for the audience. Combined with the constant machine-gun like barrage of words pouring from the actor's mouth, the movie can be quite irritating, even at its modest runtime of 102 minutes. In fact, Bringing Up Baby may be a film more interesting than entertaining. Typical of the screwball comedy, gender roles are reversed, with a male character of questionable masculinity suffering from a dominant woman who makes his life misery. Of course, they fall in love in at the end. What sets this film apart however, is Hawks' ability to take this reversal to new extremes. Martin Scorsese calls directors who manage to slip in messages pass censorship "smugglers", and in Bringing Up Baby Hawk's luggage is positively stuffed. Having a great understanding of the genre after his film Twentieth Century (1934) acted as a prototype for it, Hawks uses phallic and fetishized imagery to chart his male protagonists' quest for manliness, the most obvious being the dinosaur "bone", that, from a modern perspective, are quite shocking to see in a film made during a very conservative time in America. Also quite shocking is the amount of power women hold. David is almost always interrupted by a female character and its Susan's aunt who holds the million dollars that David needs for his museum, in addition to the bone. Hepburn's character is even seen wearing pants in a few scenes, not a dress or skirt. A rare sight in 1930s cinema. Furthermore, several historians believe the film contains one of the first mainstream uses of the word "gay" in a homosexual context, improvised by Grant during a very funny scene involving his character unwillingly wearing a women's n&eacute;glig&eacute;e. Another very funny scene involves Grant's David trying to buy a large sirloin steak for the leopard. Perhaps the experience of watching Bringing Up Baby can be summarised by the experience of eating a giant steak. At first you're excited by the humour and innovation of having a steak so big, but after a reasonable number of bites, you just want to eat something else.

    I think this is one of the most pathetic of Katherine Hepburn's movie I have ever seen. I had a feeling her movies are overrated, but this movie beats them all. What surprises me is that this movie is in IMDb's top 250 list. How can anybody rating this movie be so oblivious to aesthetic sense. Depicting comedy or errors is always welcome, but the errors in this movie aren't comical, they get irritating. The plot is as flimsy as they come, twists all repetitive and copied from previous movies. I had to summon all the patience I have got just to get through this movie. One thing I recall wondering most while watching this movie -- Is this lousy movie ever gonna end!

    Film Review  Bringing Up Baby Howard Hawk's screwball comedy, Bringing Up Baby (1938), that entails a series of misunderstandings occurring one after the other between a polite paleontologist, a gorgeous clumsy woman and a leopard named Baby. After their run in at a golf course, Susan (Katharine Hepburn) convinces David (Cary Grant) to help take care of her auntie's pet leopard, as she believes David is a zoologist rather than a paleontologist. A series of comical errors ensue throughout the film played out by excellent overall performances by the entire cast. The plot was at times very frustrating to follow, due to the absurd misunderstandings that consist of stupidity too hard to believe. This is most prominent towards the end when somehow everyone involved ends up in trouble with the police. However, aside from that, the film is a joy to watch for the brilliant acting and screen presence of Cary Grant and for the wonderful comic timing by Katharine Hepburn. Hepburn and Grant share great on-screen chemistry which at first seems to elicit the dynamic of a brother/sister friendship. Though as the film progresses, their bizarre relationship unfolds into quite an unlikely romance that didn't seem entirely convincing. In many scenes, Hawks and the editor, George Hively, deliberately showed long durations between cuts, eliciting a dynamic that resonates with an on-stage play. This decision was cleverly made to accentuate the acting skills of the cast members, particularly Hepburn and Grant. The camera lets the comedy unfold through their performances without interruption. This technique allows them the freedom that two great actors require to get the best out of their talents. It is a technique that has since been used throughout cinema for decades. Bringing Up Baby is a classical film that consists of good writing, great comic performances and many laughs along the way.

    Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant star in this inspired comedy about a madcap heiress with a pet leopard who meets an absent-minded paleontologist and unwittingly makes a fiasco of both their lives.Bringing Up Baby is an comedy that is directed by Howard Hawks.Charles Ruggles,Walter Catlett,May Robson and Fritz Feld co-star to play key supporting roles.The screenplay was adapted by Dudley Nichols and Hagar Wilde from a short story by Wilde that originally appeared in Collier's Weekly magazine. David Huxley is the stuffy paleontologist who needs to finish an exhibit on dinosaurs and thus land a $1 million grant for his museum. At a golf outing with his potential benefactors, Huxley is spotted by Susan Vance who decides that she must have the reserved scientist at all costs. She uses her pet leopard, Baby, to trick him into driving to her Connecticut home, where a dog wanders into Huxley's room and steals the vital last bone that he needs to complete his project. The real trouble begins when another leopard escapes from the local zoo and Baby is mistaken for it, leading Huxley and Susan into a series of harebrained and increasingly more insane schemes to save the cat from the authorities. Inevitably, the two end up in the local jail, where things get even more out of hand: Susan pretends to be the gun moll to David's diabolical, supposedly wanted criminal. Naturally, the mismatched pair falls in love through all the lunacy. This film is a total delight, and the performances are so invigorating that it can withstand many multiple viewings without losing its sparks.With Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant at their effervescent best, it is a seamlessly assembled comedy with enduring appeal.Director Howard Hawks plays the complications as a breathless escalation of their "love impulse," yet the movie is nonetheless romantic for all its speed. And going back to the lead stars,Grant and Hepburn are a match made in movie heaven, in sync with each other throughout.Added to that,this narrative and thematic directions have much in common with those of Shakespearean comedy.Though it's almost impossible, try to sit back sometime and enjoy this Howard Hawks masterpiece not only for its gags, but for the grace of its construction, the assurance of its style, and the richness of its themes.

Huxley in the meantime meets by chance a charmingly goofy woman, Susan, whom he doesn't like. But she in secret falls immediately for the man, and unintentionally makes his life hell as an excuse to have him close by: the morning after they meet, she calls for his help because in her apartment she has a leopard, which however is domesticated and causes really no harm. One clever plot scheme after the other brings the two into the home of Susan's aunt in Connecticut, who coincidentally (!) is the woman who is giving away the one million dollars. Since Huxley has already made a fool of himself in front of her, he tries to hide his true identity (with Susan's help), for the sake of the museum. Meanwhile, the leopard escapes. On one hand, it's a typical Hollywood film with improbable scenarios and perfectly adorable characters. One the other, it's a movie with the charm and wit of only the best of 1930's comedies; a faithful document of the time when "low-brow" humor meant slapstick and innocent silliness, instead of vulgarity and utter stupidity. But the story twists are so many and so cleverly assembled together that it's hardly low-brow comedy at all. After this, Hawks went further down his comedic career with the other big classic of his "His Girl Friday", also starring Grant.

    By design-of-nature and my environment of upbringing, I incline to keep a sensible mind with regard of viewing films, so when a screwball comedy goes it its extreme with uper-rapid pace and madcap characters, it is pretty understandable why initially this Howard Hawks film bombed tragically by its acceptance both commercially and critic-wisely, albeit Grant and Hepburn's dedicative endeavor, a well-crafted film script and its astonishing achievement of the animal (a leopard and a dog) performance (credits to their trainers as well). But now generally hailed as a paragon comedy by consensus, I wonder maybe I was born in a wrong era. I am not saying I dislike the film, it is a tongue-in-cheek urban tale which generates unsolicited laughters abound, but the off-putting disposition of Hepburn's Susan does impede me from fully appreciating this work. The story is a straight arrow zoology professor David (Grant) meets a scatterbrain wealthy girl Susan, who is inexplicably smitten with him, they first met in a golf field and without any context, once Susan sets her eyes on him, she is playing all the manipulative tricks to keep David from getting married and as stereotyped as it sounds, after a succession of zany slapsticks (mainly concerns finding a pet leopard and a barking dog), the two prove they really deserve each other. Grant is quite proficient in his usual orbit of a harmless gentleman with a double chin, plagued by laughter-induced mishaps when he is die hard trying to procure a million dollar donation for his museum, inconveniently the benefactor turns out to be Susan's auntie (Robson). Hepburn, never exemplifies herself as an excellent comedian, makes a great effort to match Grant's comic timing with her hotheaded whimsy, but the result is rather a hyperbole than a substantial stretch. Supporting players are basically expendable, Charles Ruggles' hunting-drivel-talking leopard-growl-mimicking dinner guest is the essence of what a bore a bourgeois boffin could be, and for whom we should all weep. Hawks manages to show off some camera artifices to shot the scenes between human cast and the carnivore feline, it is still magically done although we all witnessed the CGI tiger in LIFE OF PI (2012, 10/10) with awe and amazement, I suggest a remake with swapped sex, a well-heeled young man possessed with a priggish female zoologist, I doubt anyone could take the challenge, sex equality is still a halfway deal, and it goes without saying there will be a slew of CGI beasts around them.

    This is one of those films that you must re-visit perhaps once a year, because in spite of its place in Hollywood as a legendary failure (that resulted in Katharine Hepburn being listed as box office poison), it is one of the 10 funniest movies ever made. Hepburn and Cary Grant are an opposite sex version of Laurel and Hardy here, so dumb they're smart, and so over-the-top, you can't get enough of them. Grant is an expert on dinosaurs, and is missing the one important tail bone he needs to complete a 10-year project. That bone will go missing, thanks to George, a spunky pooch (who happens to look like Nick and Nora Charles' dog Asta) who grabs it then gets distracted by playing with a lovable leopard named Baby. If George and Baby weren't enough to drive Grant to wish he was extinct like the dinosaurs, then Hepburn might, yet there is something about this dizzy heiress that makes him remember that he's a man, not a bone chaser. O.K., I admit that I would be greatly annoyed to be stalked by a character as wacko and interfering as Hepburn, but watching Grant deal with her is a delightfully witty voyage. From the moment she steals his golf ball, dents his car, then tears his tuxedo jacket, you know she's attached to him like glue to a Popsicle stick. And when he accidentally retaliates and rips her dress, that sticky situation leads to even more. They are not quite the only insane ones here. Everybody has some neurotic disorder about them, even the psychiatrist (Fritz Feld) whom Hepburn and Grant encounter in a fancy restaurant and later in the country where Baby has taken up temporary residence on Feld's roof. May Robson is perplexed from the moment she sees Grant wearing a frilly ladies' robe, and Charles Ruggles adds more befuddlement into the mix when he shows up. A dipsomaniac caretaker (Barry Fitzgerald), frustrated sheriff (Walter Catlett) and Grant's jilted fianc&eacute;e (Tala Birell) are others involved in this mix, which also includes a second leopard whom even Baby might run from if they were to encounter each other in the dark. Director Howard Hawks mixes everything together seamlessly, resulting in a film of sheer perfection. Why this flopped in its initial release has never really been identified, except perhaps that Hepburn's involvement in a comedy after so many serious dramas seemed like something to skip as a misguided shot in the dark. She really proves her meddle in comedy when she pretends to be a gangster's moll, utilizing an accent that is downright hysterical. But the movie audiences in 1938 would have to wait for its rediscovery later on, and like so many other films, this one has risen above its initial failure to become one of the all-time classics, a pleasure from start to finish. Peter Bogdanovich's "What's Up Doc?" pretty much updated the plot, replacing the two leopards with identical suitcases, yet utilizing the same ensemble types of wackos to make it almost equally as enjoyable and one of the best modern comedy classics.

    Directed by one of the golden age's most prolific directors and featuring two of its biggest stars, Howard Hawks' Bringing Up Baby (1938) tells the story of David (Cary Grant), a paleontologist who's led into a series of zany events by the wild and bubbly Susan (Rita Hayworth). The bare-bones plot involves David having to retrieve a dinosaur bone for his museum from Susan's dog while the two try to manage Susan's pet leopard (the titular "Baby"). Presented via Hawk's trademark dry and no-frills directing style, Bringing Up Baby is an often funny but ultimately grating experience. The film has some great positives; it really shines in a few stand-out comedic scenes. One sees David attempting to save an ignorant Susan from embarrassment in a restaurant, and another an awkward dinner table scene that makes perfect use of dramatic irony for hilarious effect. Each of these scenes are meticulously crafted and extremely entertaining in their own right. To many critics, the film's box infamous office failure remains something of an enigma. Despite extremely positive reception from test screenings, the film failed to make its budget back during its initial run. Hawks himself felt the film "had a great fault and I learned an awful lot from that. There were no normal people in it. Everyone you met was a screwball and since that time I have learned my lesson and I don't intend ever again to make everybody crazy". I agree. There isn't a single relatable feature in any of the film's characters, and as a result it feels emotionally void. We're supposed to believe that the gawky David needs the irresponsible Susan to show him how to have fun, and that Susan needs a man to marry, but the lack of any emotional investment means the film plays out unconvincingly and the plot feels simply set up in order to allow for crazy antics to happen. This isn't helped by the movie's cut-throat pace, which, while moving things along quickly, leaves little room for character and story development, and little breathing room for the audience. Combined with the constant machine-gun like barrage of words pouring from the actor's mouth, the movie can be quite irritating, even at its modest runtime of 102 minutes. In fact, Bringing Up Baby may be a film more interesting than entertaining. Typical of the screwball comedy, gender roles are reversed, with a male character of questionable masculinity suffering from a dominant woman who makes his life misery. Of course, they fall in love in at the end. What sets this film apart however, is Hawks' ability to take this reversal to new extremes. Martin Scorsese calls directors who manage to slip in messages pass censorship "smugglers", and in Bringing Up Baby Hawk's luggage is positively stuffed. Having a great understanding of the genre after his film Twentieth Century (1934) acted as a prototype for it, Hawks uses phallic and fetishized imagery to chart his male protagonists' quest for manliness, the most obvious being the dinosaur "bone", that, from a modern perspective, are quite shocking to see in a film made during a very conservative time in America. Also quite shocking is the amount of power women hold. David is almost always interrupted by a female character and its Susan's aunt who holds the million dollars that David needs for his museum, in addition to the bone. Hepburn's character is even seen wearing pants in a few scenes, not a dress or skirt. A rare sight in 1930s cinema. Furthermore, several historians believe the film contains one of the first mainstream uses of the word "gay" in a homosexual context, improvised by Grant during a very funny scene involving his character unwillingly wearing a women's n&eacute;glig&eacute;e. Another very funny scene involves Grant's David trying to buy a large sirloin steak for the leopard. Perhaps the experience of watching Bringing Up Baby can be summarised by the experience of eating a giant steak. At first you're excited by the humour and innovation of having a steak so big, but after a reasonable number of bites, you just want to eat something else.

    I think this is one of the most pathetic of Katherine Hepburn's movie I have ever seen. I had a feeling her movies are overrated, but this movie beats them all. What surprises me is that this movie is in IMDb's top 250 list. How can anybody rating this movie be so oblivious to aesthetic sense. Depicting comedy or errors is always welcome, but the errors in this movie aren't comical, they get irritating. The plot is as flimsy as they come, twists all repetitive and copied from previous movies. I had to summon all the patience I have got just to get through this movie. One thing I recall wondering most while watching this movie -- Is this lousy movie ever gonna end!

    Film Review  Bringing Up Baby Howard Hawk's screwball comedy, Bringing Up Baby (1938), that entails a series of misunderstandings occurring one after the other between a polite paleontologist, a gorgeous clumsy woman and a leopard named Baby. After their run in at a golf course, Susan (Katharine Hepburn) convinces David (Cary Grant) to help take care of her auntie's pet leopard, as she believes David is a zoologist rather than a paleontologist. A series of comical errors ensue throughout the film played out by excellent overall performances by the entire cast. The plot was at times very frustrating to follow, due to the absurd misunderstandings that consist of stupidity too hard to believe. This is most prominent towards the end when somehow everyone involved ends up in trouble with the police. However, aside from that, the film is a joy to watch for the brilliant acting and screen presence of Cary Grant and for the wonderful comic timing by Katharine Hepburn. Hepburn and Grant share great on-screen chemistry which at first seems to elicit the dynamic of a brother/sister friendship. Though as the film progresses, their bizarre relationship unfolds into quite an unlikely romance that didn't seem entirely convincing. In many scenes, Hawks and the editor, George Hively, deliberately showed long durations between cuts, eliciting a dynamic that resonates with an on-stage play. This decision was cleverly made to accentuate the acting skills of the cast members, particularly Hepburn and Grant. The camera lets the comedy unfold through their performances without interruption. This technique allows them the freedom that two great actors require to get the best out of their talents. It is a technique that has since been used throughout cinema for decades. Bringing Up Baby is a classical film that consists of good writing, great comic performances and many laughs along the way.

    Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant star in this inspired comedy about a madcap heiress with a pet leopard who meets an absent-minded paleontologist and unwittingly makes a fiasco of both their lives.Bringing Up Baby is an comedy that is directed by Howard Hawks.Charles Ruggles,Walter Catlett,May Robson and Fritz Feld co-star to play key supporting roles.The screenplay was adapted by Dudley Nichols and Hagar Wilde from a short story by Wilde that originally appeared in Collier's Weekly magazine. David Huxley is the stuffy paleontologist who needs to finish an exhibit on dinosaurs and thus land a $1 million grant for his museum. At a golf outing with his potential benefactors, Huxley is spotted by Susan Vance who decides that she must have the reserved scientist at all costs. She uses her pet leopard, Baby, to trick him into driving to her Connecticut home, where a dog wanders into Huxley's room and steals the vital last bone that he needs to complete his project. The real trouble begins when another leopard escapes from the local zoo and Baby is mistaken for it, leading Huxley and Susan into a series of harebrained and increasingly more insane schemes to save the cat from the authorities. Inevitably, the two end up in the local jail, where things get even more out of hand: Susan pretends to be the gun moll to David's diabolical, supposedly wanted criminal. Naturally, the mismatched pair falls in love through all the lunacy. This film is a total delight, and the performances are so invigorating that it can withstand many multiple viewings without losing its sparks.With Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant at their effervescent best, it is a seamlessly assembled comedy with enduring appeal.Director Howard Hawks plays the complications as a breathless escalation of their "love impulse," yet the movie is nonetheless romantic for all its speed. And going back to the lead stars,Grant and Hepburn are a match made in movie heaven, in sync with each other throughout.Added to that,this narrative and thematic directions have much in common with those of Shakespearean comedy.Though it's almost impossible, try to sit back sometime and enjoy this Howard Hawks masterpiece not only for its gags, but for the grace of its construction, the assurance of its style, and the richness of its themes.

    There are a lot of films from the 1930s and 1940s that are incorrectly referred to a screwball comedies. This film ought to almost be considered the textbook example of a screwball comedy. Unfortunately, Howard Hawks, the director, didn't even quite get his own film! He though it didn't work because there were no normal characters in the film...which exactly makes it a screwball comedy. Think of our two main characters. Cary Grant who is a brilliant scientist with very few social skills. Katherine Hepburn who has no intellectual prowess whatsoever, but who has oodles of social skills, though they are a bit unusual. A perfect pairing. Then you have Hepburn's aunt, who now owns a leopard as a pet...who is running after Charles Ruggles, a big game hunter (of sorts). And then you have dinosaur bones versus a dog. What more do you need for a screwball comedy? One of the funniest scenes in film is in this movie -- where Katerine Hepburn's dress falls apart, and he covers it up first with his top hat, and then with his own body...as they walk through a ritzy restaurant! This comedic role is one of Grant's best. His acrobatic/athletic skills fit some of the slapstick perfectly, and his general demeanor is what you never see in any other Cary Grant role. Hepburn reportedly had a lot of difficulty with the comedy, but she comes across well as an almost total airhead. The primary supporting cast is terrific -- May Robson as the eccentric aunt, Charles Ruggles good as the big-game hunter, and a couple of great scenes with veteran comic actor Walter Catlett as a constable. You'll briefly see some other faces -- Ward Bond, and Barry Fitzgerald has a small part. Most every scene in this film made me at least smile, and a few times I laughed out loud, and that's something I rarely do. I wasn't thrilled with the swinging ladder scene at the close of the movie. That was just stupid, and they could have gotten to the same conclusion with something that would have seemed more realistically possible. But, overall, the movie's a gem...a true screwball comedy.

    Animals play a significant role in Bringing Up Baby, not just in terms of adding to comic situations, but also operating as metaphors for l'amour fou (crazy love). When we first meet him, palaeontologist David Huxley (Grant) is preparing to marry his co-worker Alice Swallow (Walker). Alice, we learn, is a rational, no-nonsense woman who sees marriage as a convenient and rational transaction rather than as an expression of love. As the film opens, David and Alice are putting the final touches on a brontosaurus skeleton that he has been working on for five years. The skeleton seems to be a symbol of the couple's relationship - dry, brittle, tenuous, old and, most importantly, dead. Enter Susan Vance (Hepburn), whose wild anarchic nature is just what the doctor ordered. She seems, on the surface, hair-brained - and this may be true - but her ditziness is the result of being absolutely, utterly, ridiculously head-over-heals in love (at first sight, as is the case with most l'amour fou scenarios) with David and doing whatever she can to sabotage his plans to marry Alice. Susan's leopard, named Baby, is the symbol of her love for David, for the moment the leopard lays its eyes on him, it is instantly affectionate and follows him around, just as Susan does. Jittery David is, of course, terrified of the beast and all that it represents. The leopard becomes an increasingly useful symbol as the film continues. At her aunt's estate in Connecticut, Susan releases another leopard its cage, thinking it is Baby captured by zoo officials when in fact it is a rogue leopard from the circus on its way to be gassed after attacking someone. With two leopards on the loose, the analogy becomes unmistakable - the wild leopard that Susan releases is David's libido, free at last after being repressed for so long in a loveless relationship. Indeed, towards the end of the film, when the wild leopard traps the host of characters in the local jail, it is nervous, terrified David who steps up and boldly saves the day. This I suppose is just one way of reading and enjoying a film like Bringing Up Baby. i think it's interesting that the film announces its interested in exploring psychoanalysis with the inclusion of a character who is a Freudian therapist (Dr Lehman played by Fritz Feld). Psychoanalysis was, of course, very popular among Hollywood screenwriters between the 30s and 50s who adopted all manner of coded symbols for sex after Joseph Breen's Production Code so tightly reasserted control over what could and couldn't be represented on screen. But the fact that Dr Lehman's diagnoses are so far off tells us that the science of the mind is no match for the power of l'amour fou, which turns men and women into wild, irrational carnal beasts.

    Screwball Comedy finds in "Bringing Up Baby" one its most better-represented manifestos, and one its most classic ad pure incarnations. Starring Hollywood icons Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn, the film was directed by Howard Hawks, one of the most eclectic American directors, as he worked on movies of all kinds, from Gangsters to Westerns To Comedies. Arguably, "Bringing Up Baby" is the culmination of the comedic side of his career. David Huxley is a paleontologist trying to convince the lawyer of a rich woman, who will be giving away one million dollars, to give the money to his museum. Huxley in the meantime meets by chance a charmingly goofy woman, Susan, whom he doesn't like. But she in secret falls immediately for the man, and unintentionally makes his life hell as an excuse to have him close by: the morning after they meet, she calls for his help because in her apartment she has a leopard, which however is domesticated and causes really no harm. One clever plot scheme after the other brings the two into the home of Susan's aunt in Connecticut, who coincidentally (!) is the woman who is giving away the one million dollars. Since Huxley has already made a fool of himself in front of her, he tries to hide his true identity (with Susan's help), for the sake of the museum. Meanwhile, the leopard escapes. On one hand, it's a typical Hollywood film with improbable scenarios and perfectly adorable characters. One the other, it's a movie with the charm and wit of only the best of 1930's comedies; a faithful document of the time when "low-brow" humor meant slapstick and innocent silliness, instead of vulgarity and utter stupidity. But the story twists are so many and so cleverly assembled together that it's hardly low-brow comedy at all. After this, Hawks went further down his comedic career with the other big classic of his "His Girl Friday", also starring Grant.

The bare-bones plot involves David having to retrieve a dinosaur bone for his museum from Susan's dog while the two try to manage Susan's pet leopard (the titular "Baby"). Presented via Hawk's trademark dry and no-frills directing style, Bringing Up Baby is an often funny but ultimately grating experience. The film has some great positives; it really shines in a few stand-out comedic scenes. One sees David attempting to save an ignorant Susan from embarrassment in a restaurant, and another an awkward dinner table scene that makes perfect use of dramatic irony for hilarious effect. Each of these scenes are meticulously crafted and extremely entertaining in their own right. To many critics, the film's box infamous office failure remains something of an enigma. Despite extremely positive reception from test screenings, the film failed to make its budget back during its initial run. Hawks himself felt the film "had a great fault and I learned an awful lot from that. There were no normal people in it. Everyone you met was a screwball and since that time I have learned my lesson and I don't intend ever again to make everybody crazy". I agree. There isn't a single relatable feature in any of the film's characters, and as a result it feels emotionally void. We're supposed to believe that the gawky David needs the irresponsible Susan to show him how to have fun, and that Susan needs a man to marry, but the lack of any emotional investment means the film plays out unconvincingly and the plot feels simply set up in order to allow for crazy antics to happen. This isn't helped by the movie's cut-throat pace, which, while moving things along quickly, leaves little room for character and story development, and little breathing room for the audience. Combined with the constant machine-gun like barrage of words pouring from the actor's mouth, the movie can be quite irritating, even at its modest runtime of 102 minutes. In fact, Bringing Up Baby may be a film more interesting than entertaining. Typical of the screwball comedy, gender roles are reversed, with a male character of questionable masculinity suffering from a dominant woman who makes his life misery. Of course, they fall in love in at the end. What sets this film apart however, is Hawks' ability to take this reversal to new extremes. Martin Scorsese calls directors who manage to slip in messages pass censorship "smugglers", and in Bringing Up Baby Hawk's luggage is positively stuffed. Having a great understanding of the genre after his film Twentieth Century (1934) acted as a prototype for it, Hawks uses phallic and fetishized imagery to chart his male protagonists' quest for manliness, the most obvious being the dinosaur "bone", that, from a modern perspective, are quite shocking to see in a film made during a very conservative time in America. Also quite shocking is the amount of power women hold. David is almost always interrupted by a female character and its Susan's aunt who holds the million dollars that David needs for his museum, in addition to the bone. Hepburn's character is even seen wearing pants in a few scenes, not a dress or skirt. A rare sight in 1930s cinema. Furthermore, several historians believe the film contains one of the first mainstream uses of the word "gay" in a homosexual context, improvised by Grant during a very funny scene involving his character unwillingly wearing a women's n&eacute;glig&eacute;e. Another very funny scene involves Grant's David trying to buy a large sirloin steak for the leopard. Perhaps the experience of watching Bringing Up Baby can be summarised by the experience of eating a giant steak. At first you're excited by the humour and innovation of having a steak so big, but after a reasonable number of bites, you just want to eat something else.

    I think this is one of the most pathetic of Katherine Hepburn's movie I have ever seen. I had a feeling her movies are overrated, but this movie beats them all. What surprises me is that this movie is in IMDb's top 250 list. How can anybody rating this movie be so oblivious to aesthetic sense. Depicting comedy or errors is always welcome, but the errors in this movie aren't comical, they get irritating. The plot is as flimsy as they come, twists all repetitive and copied from previous movies. I had to summon all the patience I have got just to get through this movie. One thing I recall wondering most while watching this movie -- Is this lousy movie ever gonna end!

    Film Review  Bringing Up Baby Howard Hawk's screwball comedy, Bringing Up Baby (1938), that entails a series of misunderstandings occurring one after the other between a polite paleontologist, a gorgeous clumsy woman and a leopard named Baby. After their run in at a golf course, Susan (Katharine Hepburn) convinces David (Cary Grant) to help take care of her auntie's pet leopard, as she believes David is a zoologist rather than a paleontologist. A series of comical errors ensue throughout the film played out by excellent overall performances by the entire cast. The plot was at times very frustrating to follow, due to the absurd misunderstandings that consist of stupidity too hard to believe. This is most prominent towards the end when somehow everyone involved ends up in trouble with the police. However, aside from that, the film is a joy to watch for the brilliant acting and screen presence of Cary Grant and for the wonderful comic timing by Katharine Hepburn. Hepburn and Grant share great on-screen chemistry which at first seems to elicit the dynamic of a brother/sister friendship. Though as the film progresses, their bizarre relationship unfolds into quite an unlikely romance that didn't seem entirely convincing. In many scenes, Hawks and the editor, George Hively, deliberately showed long durations between cuts, eliciting a dynamic that resonates with an on-stage play. This decision was cleverly made to accentuate the acting skills of the cast members, particularly Hepburn and Grant. The camera lets the comedy unfold through their performances without interruption. This technique allows them the freedom that two great actors require to get the best out of their talents. It is a technique that has since been used throughout cinema for decades. Bringing Up Baby is a classical film that consists of good writing, great comic performances and many laughs along the way.

    Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant star in this inspired comedy about a madcap heiress with a pet leopard who meets an absent-minded paleontologist and unwittingly makes a fiasco of both their lives.Bringing Up Baby is an comedy that is directed by Howard Hawks.Charles Ruggles,Walter Catlett,May Robson and Fritz Feld co-star to play key supporting roles.The screenplay was adapted by Dudley Nichols and Hagar Wilde from a short story by Wilde that originally appeared in Collier's Weekly magazine. David Huxley is the stuffy paleontologist who needs to finish an exhibit on dinosaurs and thus land a $1 million grant for his museum. At a golf outing with his potential benefactors, Huxley is spotted by Susan Vance who decides that she must have the reserved scientist at all costs. She uses her pet leopard, Baby, to trick him into driving to her Connecticut home, where a dog wanders into Huxley's room and steals the vital last bone that he needs to complete his project. The real trouble begins when another leopard escapes from the local zoo and Baby is mistaken for it, leading Huxley and Susan into a series of harebrained and increasingly more insane schemes to save the cat from the authorities. Inevitably, the two end up in the local jail, where things get even more out of hand: Susan pretends to be the gun moll to David's diabolical, supposedly wanted criminal. Naturally, the mismatched pair falls in love through all the lunacy. This film is a total delight, and the performances are so invigorating that it can withstand many multiple viewings without losing its sparks.With Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant at their effervescent best, it is a seamlessly assembled comedy with enduring appeal.Director Howard Hawks plays the complications as a breathless escalation of their "love impulse," yet the movie is nonetheless romantic for all its speed. And going back to the lead stars,Grant and Hepburn are a match made in movie heaven, in sync with each other throughout.Added to that,this narrative and thematic directions have much in common with those of Shakespearean comedy.Though it's almost impossible, try to sit back sometime and enjoy this Howard Hawks masterpiece not only for its gags, but for the grace of its construction, the assurance of its style, and the richness of its themes.

    There are a lot of films from the 1930s and 1940s that are incorrectly referred to a screwball comedies. This film ought to almost be considered the textbook example of a screwball comedy. Unfortunately, Howard Hawks, the director, didn't even quite get his own film! He though it didn't work because there were no normal characters in the film...which exactly makes it a screwball comedy. Think of our two main characters. Cary Grant who is a brilliant scientist with very few social skills. Katherine Hepburn who has no intellectual prowess whatsoever, but who has oodles of social skills, though they are a bit unusual. A perfect pairing. Then you have Hepburn's aunt, who now owns a leopard as a pet...who is running after Charles Ruggles, a big game hunter (of sorts). And then you have dinosaur bones versus a dog. What more do you need for a screwball comedy? One of the funniest scenes in film is in this movie -- where Katerine Hepburn's dress falls apart, and he covers it up first with his top hat, and then with his own body...as they walk through a ritzy restaurant! This comedic role is one of Grant's best. His acrobatic/athletic skills fit some of the slapstick perfectly, and his general demeanor is what you never see in any other Cary Grant role. Hepburn reportedly had a lot of difficulty with the comedy, but she comes across well as an almost total airhead. The primary supporting cast is terrific -- May Robson as the eccentric aunt, Charles Ruggles good as the big-game hunter, and a couple of great scenes with veteran comic actor Walter Catlett as a constable. You'll briefly see some other faces -- Ward Bond, and Barry Fitzgerald has a small part. Most every scene in this film made me at least smile, and a few times I laughed out loud, and that's something I rarely do. I wasn't thrilled with the swinging ladder scene at the close of the movie. That was just stupid, and they could have gotten to the same conclusion with something that would have seemed more realistically possible. But, overall, the movie's a gem...a true screwball comedy.

    Animals play a significant role in Bringing Up Baby, not just in terms of adding to comic situations, but also operating as metaphors for l'amour fou (crazy love). When we first meet him, palaeontologist David Huxley (Grant) is preparing to marry his co-worker Alice Swallow (Walker). Alice, we learn, is a rational, no-nonsense woman who sees marriage as a convenient and rational transaction rather than as an expression of love. As the film opens, David and Alice are putting the final touches on a brontosaurus skeleton that he has been working on for five years. The skeleton seems to be a symbol of the couple's relationship - dry, brittle, tenuous, old and, most importantly, dead. Enter Susan Vance (Hepburn), whose wild anarchic nature is just what the doctor ordered. She seems, on the surface, hair-brained - and this may be true - but her ditziness is the result of being absolutely, utterly, ridiculously head-over-heals in love (at first sight, as is the case with most l'amour fou scenarios) with David and doing whatever she can to sabotage his plans to marry Alice. Susan's leopard, named Baby, is the symbol of her love for David, for the moment the leopard lays its eyes on him, it is instantly affectionate and follows him around, just as Susan does. Jittery David is, of course, terrified of the beast and all that it represents. The leopard becomes an increasingly useful symbol as the film continues. At her aunt's estate in Connecticut, Susan releases another leopard its cage, thinking it is Baby captured by zoo officials when in fact it is a rogue leopard from the circus on its way to be gassed after attacking someone. With two leopards on the loose, the analogy becomes unmistakable - the wild leopard that Susan releases is David's libido, free at last after being repressed for so long in a loveless relationship. Indeed, towards the end of the film, when the wild leopard traps the host of characters in the local jail, it is nervous, terrified David who steps up and boldly saves the day. This I suppose is just one way of reading and enjoying a film like Bringing Up Baby. i think it's interesting that the film announces its interested in exploring psychoanalysis with the inclusion of a character who is a Freudian therapist (Dr Lehman played by Fritz Feld). Psychoanalysis was, of course, very popular among Hollywood screenwriters between the 30s and 50s who adopted all manner of coded symbols for sex after Joseph Breen's Production Code so tightly reasserted control over what could and couldn't be represented on screen. But the fact that Dr Lehman's diagnoses are so far off tells us that the science of the mind is no match for the power of l'amour fou, which turns men and women into wild, irrational carnal beasts.

    Screwball Comedy finds in "Bringing Up Baby" one its most better-represented manifestos, and one its most classic ad pure incarnations. Starring Hollywood icons Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn, the film was directed by Howard Hawks, one of the most eclectic American directors, as he worked on movies of all kinds, from Gangsters to Westerns To Comedies. Arguably, "Bringing Up Baby" is the culmination of the comedic side of his career. David Huxley is a paleontologist trying to convince the lawyer of a rich woman, who will be giving away one million dollars, to give the money to his museum. Huxley in the meantime meets by chance a charmingly goofy woman, Susan, whom he doesn't like. But she in secret falls immediately for the man, and unintentionally makes his life hell as an excuse to have him close by: the morning after they meet, she calls for his help because in her apartment she has a leopard, which however is domesticated and causes really no harm. One clever plot scheme after the other brings the two into the home of Susan's aunt in Connecticut, who coincidentally (!) is the woman who is giving away the one million dollars. Since Huxley has already made a fool of himself in front of her, he tries to hide his true identity (with Susan's help), for the sake of the museum. Meanwhile, the leopard escapes. On one hand, it's a typical Hollywood film with improbable scenarios and perfectly adorable characters. One the other, it's a movie with the charm and wit of only the best of 1930's comedies; a faithful document of the time when "low-brow" humor meant slapstick and innocent silliness, instead of vulgarity and utter stupidity. But the story twists are so many and so cleverly assembled together that it's hardly low-brow comedy at all. After this, Hawks went further down his comedic career with the other big classic of his "His Girl Friday", also starring Grant.

    By design-of-nature and my environment of upbringing, I incline to keep a sensible mind with regard of viewing films, so when a screwball comedy goes it its extreme with uper-rapid pace and madcap characters, it is pretty understandable why initially this Howard Hawks film bombed tragically by its acceptance both commercially and critic-wisely, albeit Grant and Hepburn's dedicative endeavor, a well-crafted film script and its astonishing achievement of the animal (a leopard and a dog) performance (credits to their trainers as well). But now generally hailed as a paragon comedy by consensus, I wonder maybe I was born in a wrong era. I am not saying I dislike the film, it is a tongue-in-cheek urban tale which generates unsolicited laughters abound, but the off-putting disposition of Hepburn's Susan does impede me from fully appreciating this work. The story is a straight arrow zoology professor David (Grant) meets a scatterbrain wealthy girl Susan, who is inexplicably smitten with him, they first met in a golf field and without any context, once Susan sets her eyes on him, she is playing all the manipulative tricks to keep David from getting married and as stereotyped as it sounds, after a succession of zany slapsticks (mainly concerns finding a pet leopard and a barking dog), the two prove they really deserve each other. Grant is quite proficient in his usual orbit of a harmless gentleman with a double chin, plagued by laughter-induced mishaps when he is die hard trying to procure a million dollar donation for his museum, inconveniently the benefactor turns out to be Susan's auntie (Robson). Hepburn, never exemplifies herself as an excellent comedian, makes a great effort to match Grant's comic timing with her hotheaded whimsy, but the result is rather a hyperbole than a substantial stretch. Supporting players are basically expendable, Charles Ruggles' hunting-drivel-talking leopard-growl-mimicking dinner guest is the essence of what a bore a bourgeois boffin could be, and for whom we should all weep. Hawks manages to show off some camera artifices to shot the scenes between human cast and the carnivore feline, it is still magically done although we all witnessed the CGI tiger in LIFE OF PI (2012, 10/10) with awe and amazement, I suggest a remake with swapped sex, a well-heeled young man possessed with a priggish female zoologist, I doubt anyone could take the challenge, sex equality is still a halfway deal, and it goes without saying there will be a slew of CGI beasts around them.

    This is one of those films that you must re-visit perhaps once a year, because in spite of its place in Hollywood as a legendary failure (that resulted in Katharine Hepburn being listed as box office poison), it is one of the 10 funniest movies ever made. Hepburn and Cary Grant are an opposite sex version of Laurel and Hardy here, so dumb they're smart, and so over-the-top, you can't get enough of them. Grant is an expert on dinosaurs, and is missing the one important tail bone he needs to complete a 10-year project. That bone will go missing, thanks to George, a spunky pooch (who happens to look like Nick and Nora Charles' dog Asta) who grabs it then gets distracted by playing with a lovable leopard named Baby. If George and Baby weren't enough to drive Grant to wish he was extinct like the dinosaurs, then Hepburn might, yet there is something about this dizzy heiress that makes him remember that he's a man, not a bone chaser. O.K., I admit that I would be greatly annoyed to be stalked by a character as wacko and interfering as Hepburn, but watching Grant deal with her is a delightfully witty voyage. From the moment she steals his golf ball, dents his car, then tears his tuxedo jacket, you know she's attached to him like glue to a Popsicle stick. And when he accidentally retaliates and rips her dress, that sticky situation leads to even more. They are not quite the only insane ones here. Everybody has some neurotic disorder about them, even the psychiatrist (Fritz Feld) whom Hepburn and Grant encounter in a fancy restaurant and later in the country where Baby has taken up temporary residence on Feld's roof. May Robson is perplexed from the moment she sees Grant wearing a frilly ladies' robe, and Charles Ruggles adds more befuddlement into the mix when he shows up. A dipsomaniac caretaker (Barry Fitzgerald), frustrated sheriff (Walter Catlett) and Grant's jilted fianc&eacute;e (Tala Birell) are others involved in this mix, which also includes a second leopard whom even Baby might run from if they were to encounter each other in the dark. Director Howard Hawks mixes everything together seamlessly, resulting in a film of sheer perfection. Why this flopped in its initial release has never really been identified, except perhaps that Hepburn's involvement in a comedy after so many serious dramas seemed like something to skip as a misguided shot in the dark. She really proves her meddle in comedy when she pretends to be a gangster's moll, utilizing an accent that is downright hysterical. But the movie audiences in 1938 would have to wait for its rediscovery later on, and like so many other films, this one has risen above its initial failure to become one of the all-time classics, a pleasure from start to finish. Peter Bogdanovich's "What's Up Doc?" pretty much updated the plot, replacing the two leopards with identical suitcases, yet utilizing the same ensemble types of wackos to make it almost equally as enjoyable and one of the best modern comedy classics.

    if you believe than all "30 years comedies are same fruit basket, you are wrong. if you see Katherine Hepburn only as feminism icon, you make a great mistake. because this film is out of ordinaries rules. a great, amazing, chaotic, seductive comedy. out of expectations, full of flavor of its period but, in same time, real special. it is an adorable surprise. nothing more. a man, a woman and a lot of crazy adventures. entertainment but, in same measure, a story of love with different bricks and spices. it has something from Russian comedies but, in same time, it respects the law of Hollywood. a precise chaos. that is it. like a firework. or, only, like a splendid birthday cake.

    There are a lot of films from the 1930s and 1940s that are incorrectly referred to a screwball comedies. This film ought to almost be considered the textbook example of a screwball comedy. Unfortunately, Howard Hawks, the director, didn't even quite get his own film! He though it didn't work because there were no normal characters in the film...which exactly makes it a screwball comedy. Think of our two main characters. Cary Grant who is a brilliant scientist with very few social skills. Katherine Hepburn who has no intellectual prowess whatsoever, but who has oodles of social skills, though they are a bit unusual. A perfect pairing. Then you have Hepburn's aunt, who now owns a leopard as a pet...who is running after Charles Ruggles, a big game hunter (of sorts). And then you have dinosaur bones versus a dog. What more do you need for a screwball comedy? One of the funniest scenes in film is in this movie -- where Katerine Hepburn's dress falls apart, and he covers it up first with his top hat, and then with his own body...as they walk through a ritzy restaurant! This comedic role is one of Grant's best. His acrobatic/athletic skills fit some of the slapstick perfectly, and his general demeanor is what you never see in any other Cary Grant role. Hepburn reportedly had a lot of difficulty with the comedy, but she comes across well as an almost total airhead. The primary supporting cast is terrific -- May Robson as the eccentric aunt, Charles Ruggles good as the big-game hunter, and a couple of great scenes with veteran comic actor Walter Catlett as a constable. You'll briefly see some other faces -- Ward Bond, and Barry Fitzgerald has a small part. Most every scene in this film made me at least smile, and a few times I laughed out loud, and that's something I rarely do. I wasn't thrilled with the swinging ladder scene at the close of the movie. That was just stupid, and they could have gotten to the same conclusion with something that would have seemed more realistically possible. But, overall, the movie's a gem...a true screwball comedy.

    Animals play a significant role in Bringing Up Baby, not just in terms of adding to comic situations, but also operating as metaphors for l'amour fou (crazy love). When we first meet him, palaeontologist David Huxley (Grant) is preparing to marry his co-worker Alice Swallow (Walker). Alice, we learn, is a rational, no-nonsense woman who sees marriage as a convenient and rational transaction rather than as an expression of love. As the film opens, David and Alice are putting the final touches on a brontosaurus skeleton that he has been working on for five years. The skeleton seems to be a symbol of the couple's relationship - dry, brittle, tenuous, old and, most importantly, dead. Enter Susan Vance (Hepburn), whose wild anarchic nature is just what the doctor ordered. She seems, on the surface, hair-brained - and this may be true - but her ditziness is the result of being absolutely, utterly, ridiculously head-over-heals in love (at first sight, as is the case with most l'amour fou scenarios) with David and doing whatever she can to sabotage his plans to marry Alice. Susan's leopard, named Baby, is the symbol of her love for David, for the moment the leopard lays its eyes on him, it is instantly affectionate and follows him around, just as Susan does. Jittery David is, of course, terrified of the beast and all that it represents. The leopard becomes an increasingly useful symbol as the film continues. At her aunt's estate in Connecticut, Susan releases another leopard its cage, thinking it is Baby captured by zoo officials when in fact it is a rogue leopard from the circus on its way to be gassed after attacking someone. With two leopards on the loose, the analogy becomes unmistakable - the wild leopard that Susan releases is David's libido, free at last after being repressed for so long in a loveless relationship. Indeed, towards the end of the film, when the wild leopard traps the host of characters in the local jail, it is nervous, terrified David who steps up and boldly saves the day. This I suppose is just one way of reading and enjoying a film like Bringing Up Baby. i think it's interesting that the film announces its interested in exploring psychoanalysis with the inclusion of a character who is a Freudian therapist (Dr Lehman played by Fritz Feld). Psychoanalysis was, of course, very popular among Hollywood screenwriters between the 30s and 50s who adopted all manner of coded symbols for sex after Joseph Breen's Production Code so tightly reasserted control over what could and couldn't be represented on screen. But the fact that Dr Lehman's diagnoses are so far off tells us that the science of the mind is no match for the power of l'amour fou, which turns men and women into wild, irrational carnal beasts.

    Screwball Comedy finds in "Bringing Up Baby" one its most better-represented manifestos, and one its most classic ad pure incarnations. Starring Hollywood icons Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn, the film was directed by Howard Hawks, one of the most eclectic American directors, as he worked on movies of all kinds, from Gangsters to Westerns To Comedies. Arguably, "Bringing Up Baby" is the culmination of the comedic side of his career. David Huxley is a paleontologist trying to convince the lawyer of a rich woman, who will be giving away one million dollars, to give the money to his museum. Huxley in the meantime meets by chance a charmingly goofy woman, Susan, whom he doesn't like. But she in secret falls immediately for the man, and unintentionally makes his life hell as an excuse to have him close by: the morning after they meet, she calls for his help because in her apartment she has a leopard, which however is domesticated and causes really no harm. One clever plot scheme after the other brings the two into the home of Susan's aunt in Connecticut, who coincidentally (!) is the woman who is giving away the one million dollars. Since Huxley has already made a fool of himself in front of her, he tries to hide his true identity (with Susan's help), for the sake of the museum. Meanwhile, the leopard escapes. On one hand, it's a typical Hollywood film with improbable scenarios and perfectly adorable characters. One the other, it's a movie with the charm and wit of only the best of 1930's comedies; a faithful document of the time when "low-brow" humor meant slapstick and innocent silliness, instead of vulgarity and utter stupidity. But the story twists are so many and so cleverly assembled together that it's hardly low-brow comedy at all. After this, Hawks went further down his comedic career with the other big classic of his "His Girl Friday", also starring Grant.

    By design-of-nature and my environment of upbringing, I incline to keep a sensible mind with regard of viewing films, so when a screwball comedy goes it its extreme with uper-rapid pace and madcap characters, it is pretty understandable why initially this Howard Hawks film bombed tragically by its acceptance both commercially and critic-wisely, albeit Grant and Hepburn's dedicative endeavor, a well-crafted film script and its astonishing achievement of the animal (a leopard and a dog) performance (credits to their trainers as well). But now generally hailed as a paragon comedy by consensus, I wonder maybe I was born in a wrong era. I am not saying I dislike the film, it is a tongue-in-cheek urban tale which generates unsolicited laughters abound, but the off-putting disposition of Hepburn's Susan does impede me from fully appreciating this work. The story is a straight arrow zoology professor David (Grant) meets a scatterbrain wealthy girl Susan, who is inexplicably smitten with him, they first met in a golf field and without any context, once Susan sets her eyes on him, she is playing all the manipulative tricks to keep David from getting married and as stereotyped as it sounds, after a succession of zany slapsticks (mainly concerns finding a pet leopard and a barking dog), the two prove they really deserve each other. Grant is quite proficient in his usual orbit of a harmless gentleman with a double chin, plagued by laughter-induced mishaps when he is die hard trying to procure a million dollar donation for his museum, inconveniently the benefactor turns out to be Susan's auntie (Robson). Hepburn, never exemplifies herself as an excellent comedian, makes a great effort to match Grant's comic timing with her hotheaded whimsy, but the result is rather a hyperbole than a substantial stretch. Supporting players are basically expendable, Charles Ruggles' hunting-drivel-talking leopard-growl-mimicking dinner guest is the essence of what a bore a bourgeois boffin could be, and for whom we should all weep. Hawks manages to show off some camera artifices to shot the scenes between human cast and the carnivore feline, it is still magically done although we all witnessed the CGI tiger in LIFE OF PI (2012, 10/10) with awe and amazement, I suggest a remake with swapped sex, a well-heeled young man possessed with a priggish female zoologist, I doubt anyone could take the challenge, sex equality is still a halfway deal, and it goes without saying there will be a slew of CGI beasts around them.

    This is one of those films that you must re-visit perhaps once a year, because in spite of its place in Hollywood as a legendary failure (that resulted in Katharine Hepburn being listed as box office poison), it is one of the 10 funniest movies ever made. Hepburn and Cary Grant are an opposite sex version of Laurel and Hardy here, so dumb they're smart, and so over-the-top, you can't get enough of them. Grant is an expert on dinosaurs, and is missing the one important tail bone he needs to complete a 10-year project. That bone will go missing, thanks to George, a spunky pooch (who happens to look like Nick and Nora Charles' dog Asta) who grabs it then gets distracted by playing with a lovable leopard named Baby. If George and Baby weren't enough to drive Grant to wish he was extinct like the dinosaurs, then Hepburn might, yet there is something about this dizzy heiress that makes him remember that he's a man, not a bone chaser. O.K., I admit that I would be greatly annoyed to be stalked by a character as wacko and interfering as Hepburn, but watching Grant deal with her is a delightfully witty voyage. From the moment she steals his golf ball, dents his car, then tears his tuxedo jacket, you know she's attached to him like glue to a Popsicle stick. And when he accidentally retaliates and rips her dress, that sticky situation leads to even more. They are not quite the only insane ones here. Everybody has some neurotic disorder about them, even the psychiatrist (Fritz Feld) whom Hepburn and Grant encounter in a fancy restaurant and later in the country where Baby has taken up temporary residence on Feld's roof. May Robson is perplexed from the moment she sees Grant wearing a frilly ladies' robe, and Charles Ruggles adds more befuddlement into the mix when he shows up. A dipsomaniac caretaker (Barry Fitzgerald), frustrated sheriff (Walter Catlett) and Grant's jilted fianc&eacute;e (Tala Birell) are others involved in this mix, which also includes a second leopard whom even Baby might run from if they were to encounter each other in the dark. Director Howard Hawks mixes everything together seamlessly, resulting in a film of sheer perfection. Why this flopped in its initial release has never really been identified, except perhaps that Hepburn's involvement in a comedy after so many serious dramas seemed like something to skip as a misguided shot in the dark. She really proves her meddle in comedy when she pretends to be a gangster's moll, utilizing an accent that is downright hysterical. But the movie audiences in 1938 would have to wait for its rediscovery later on, and like so many other films, this one has risen above its initial failure to become one of the all-time classics, a pleasure from start to finish. Peter Bogdanovich's "What's Up Doc?" pretty much updated the plot, replacing the two leopards with identical suitcases, yet utilizing the same ensemble types of wackos to make it almost equally as enjoyable and one of the best modern comedy classics.

    if you believe than all "30 years comedies are same fruit basket, you are wrong. if you see Katherine Hepburn only as feminism icon, you make a great mistake. because this film is out of ordinaries rules. a great, amazing, chaotic, seductive comedy. out of expectations, full of flavor of its period but, in same time, real special. it is an adorable surprise. nothing more. a man, a woman and a lot of crazy adventures. entertainment but, in same measure, a story of love with different bricks and spices. it has something from Russian comedies but, in same time, it respects the law of Hollywood. a precise chaos. that is it. like a firework. or, only, like a splendid birthday cake.

    Directed by one of the golden age's most prolific directors and featuring two of its biggest stars, Howard Hawks' Bringing Up Baby (1938) tells the story of David (Cary Grant), a paleontologist who's led into a series of zany events by the wild and bubbly Susan (Rita Hayworth). The bare-bones plot involves David having to retrieve a dinosaur bone for his museum from Susan's dog while the two try to manage Susan's pet leopard (the titular "Baby"). Presented via Hawk's trademark dry and no-frills directing style, Bringing Up Baby is an often funny but ultimately grating experience. The film has some great positives; it really shines in a few stand-out comedic scenes. One sees David attempting to save an ignorant Susan from embarrassment in a restaurant, and another an awkward dinner table scene that makes perfect use of dramatic irony for hilarious effect. Each of these scenes are meticulously crafted and extremely entertaining in their own right. To many critics, the film's box infamous office failure remains something of an enigma. Despite extremely positive reception from test screenings, the film failed to make its budget back during its initial run. Hawks himself felt the film "had a great fault and I learned an awful lot from that. There were no normal people in it. Everyone you met was a screwball and since that time I have learned my lesson and I don't intend ever again to make everybody crazy". I agree. There isn't a single relatable feature in any of the film's characters, and as a result it feels emotionally void. We're supposed to believe that the gawky David needs the irresponsible Susan to show him how to have fun, and that Susan needs a man to marry, but the lack of any emotional investment means the film plays out unconvincingly and the plot feels simply set up in order to allow for crazy antics to happen. This isn't helped by the movie's cut-throat pace, which, while moving things along quickly, leaves little room for character and story development, and little breathing room for the audience. Combined with the constant machine-gun like barrage of words pouring from the actor's mouth, the movie can be quite irritating, even at its modest runtime of 102 minutes. In fact, Bringing Up Baby may be a film more interesting than entertaining. Typical of the screwball comedy, gender roles are reversed, with a male character of questionable masculinity suffering from a dominant woman who makes his life misery. Of course, they fall in love in at the end. What sets this film apart however, is Hawks' ability to take this reversal to new extremes. Martin Scorsese calls directors who manage to slip in messages pass censorship "smugglers", and in Bringing Up Baby Hawk's luggage is positively stuffed. Having a great understanding of the genre after his film Twentieth Century (1934) acted as a prototype for it, Hawks uses phallic and fetishized imagery to chart his male protagonists' quest for manliness, the most obvious being the dinosaur "bone", that, from a modern perspective, are quite shocking to see in a film made during a very conservative time in America. Also quite shocking is the amount of power women hold. David is almost always interrupted by a female character and its Susan's aunt who holds the million dollars that David needs for his museum, in addition to the bone. Hepburn's character is even seen wearing pants in a few scenes, not a dress or skirt. A rare sight in 1930s cinema. Furthermore, several historians believe the film contains one of the first mainstream uses of the word "gay" in a homosexual context, improvised by Grant during a very funny scene involving his character unwillingly wearing a women's n&eacute;glig&eacute;e. Another very funny scene involves Grant's David trying to buy a large sirloin steak for the leopard. Perhaps the experience of watching Bringing Up Baby can be summarised by the experience of eating a giant steak. At first you're excited by the humour and innovation of having a steak so big, but after a reasonable number of bites, you just want to eat something else.

    I think this is one of the most pathetic of Katherine Hepburn's movie I have ever seen. I had a feeling her movies are overrated, but this movie beats them all. What surprises me is that this movie is in IMDb's top 250 list. How can anybody rating this movie be so oblivious to aesthetic sense. Depicting comedy or errors is always welcome, but the errors in this movie aren't comical, they get irritating. The plot is as flimsy as they come, twists all repetitive and copied from previous movies. I had to summon all the patience I have got just to get through this movie. One thing I recall wondering most while watching this movie -- Is this lousy movie ever gonna end!

    Film Review  Bringing Up Baby Howard Hawk's screwball comedy, Bringing Up Baby (1938), that entails a series of misunderstandings occurring one after the other between a polite paleontologist, a gorgeous clumsy woman and a leopard named Baby. After their run in at a golf course, Susan (Katharine Hepburn) convinces David (Cary Grant) to help take care of her auntie's pet leopard, as she believes David is a zoologist rather than a paleontologist. A series of comical errors ensue throughout the film played out by excellent overall performances by the entire cast. The plot was at times very frustrating to follow, due to the absurd misunderstandings that consist of stupidity too hard to believe. This is most prominent towards the end when somehow everyone involved ends up in trouble with the police. However, aside from that, the film is a joy to watch for the brilliant acting and screen presence of Cary Grant and for the wonderful comic timing by Katharine Hepburn. Hepburn and Grant share great on-screen chemistry which at first seems to elicit the dynamic of a brother/sister friendship. Though as the film progresses, their bizarre relationship unfolds into quite an unlikely romance that didn't seem entirely convincing. In many scenes, Hawks and the editor, George Hively, deliberately showed long durations between cuts, eliciting a dynamic that resonates with an on-stage play. This decision was cleverly made to accentuate the acting skills of the cast members, particularly Hepburn and Grant. The camera lets the comedy unfold through their performances without interruption. This technique allows them the freedom that two great actors require to get the best out of their talents. It is a technique that has since been used throughout cinema for decades. Bringing Up Baby is a classical film that consists of good writing, great comic performances and many laughs along the way.

    Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant star in this inspired comedy about a madcap heiress with a pet leopard who meets an absent-minded paleontologist and unwittingly makes a fiasco of both their lives.Bringing Up Baby is an comedy that is directed by Howard Hawks.Charles Ruggles,Walter Catlett,May Robson and Fritz Feld co-star to play key supporting roles.The screenplay was adapted by Dudley Nichols and Hagar Wilde from a short story by Wilde that originally appeared in Collier's Weekly magazine. David Huxley is the stuffy paleontologist who needs to finish an exhibit on dinosaurs and thus land a $1 million grant for his museum. At a golf outing with his potential benefactors, Huxley is spotted by Susan Vance who decides that she must have the reserved scientist at all costs. She uses her pet leopard, Baby, to trick him into driving to her Connecticut home, where a dog wanders into Huxley's room and steals the vital last bone that he needs to complete his project. The real trouble begins when another leopard escapes from the local zoo and Baby is mistaken for it, leading Huxley and Susan into a series of harebrained and increasingly more insane schemes to save the cat from the authorities. Inevitably, the two end up in the local jail, where things get even more out of hand: Susan pretends to be the gun moll to David's diabolical, supposedly wanted criminal. Naturally, the mismatched pair falls in love through all the lunacy. This film is a total delight, and the performances are so invigorating that it can withstand many multiple viewings without losing its sparks.With Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant at their effervescent best, it is a seamlessly assembled comedy with enduring appeal.Director Howard Hawks plays the complications as a breathless escalation of their "love impulse," yet the movie is nonetheless romantic for all its speed. And going back to the lead stars,Grant and Hepburn are a match made in movie heaven, in sync with each other throughout.Added to that,this narrative and thematic directions have much in common with those of Shakespearean comedy.Though it's almost impossible, try to sit back sometime and enjoy this Howard Hawks masterpiece not only for its gags, but for the grace of its construction, the assurance of its style, and the richness of its themes.

    By design-of-nature and my environment of upbringing, I incline to keep a sensible mind with regard of viewing films, so when a screwball comedy goes it its extreme with uper-rapid pace and madcap characters, it is pretty understandable why initially this Howard Hawks film bombed tragically by its acceptance both commercially and critic-wisely, albeit Grant and Hepburn's dedicative endeavor, a well-crafted film script and its astonishing achievement of the animal (a leopard and a dog) performance (credits to their trainers as well). But now generally hailed as a paragon comedy by consensus, I wonder maybe I was born in a wrong era. I am not saying I dislike the film, it is a tongue-in-cheek urban tale which generates unsolicited laughters abound, but the off-putting disposition of Hepburn's Susan does impede me from fully appreciating this work. The story is a straight arrow zoology professor David (Grant) meets a scatterbrain wealthy girl Susan, who is inexplicably smitten with him, they first met in a golf field and without any context, once Susan sets her eyes on him, she is playing all the manipulative tricks to keep David from getting married and as stereotyped as it sounds, after a succession of zany slapsticks (mainly concerns finding a pet leopard and a barking dog), the two prove they really deserve each other.

Hepburn, never exemplifies herself as an excellent comedian, makes a great effort to match Grant's comic timing with her hotheaded whimsy, but the result is rather a hyperbole than a substantial stretch. Supporting players are basically expendable, Charles Ruggles' hunting-drivel-talking leopard-growl-mimicking dinner guest is the essence of what a bore a bourgeois boffin could be, and for whom we should all weep.

    This is one of those films that you must re-visit perhaps once a year, because in spite of its place in Hollywood as a legendary failure (that resulted in Katharine Hepburn being listed as box office poison), it is one of the 10 funniest movies ever made. Hepburn and Cary Grant are an opposite sex version of Laurel and Hardy here, so dumb they're smart, and so over-the-top, you can't get enough of them. Grant is an expert on dinosaurs, and is missing the one important tail bone he needs to complete a 10-year project. That bone will go missing, thanks to George, a spunky pooch (who happens to look like Nick and Nora Charles' dog Asta) who grabs it then gets distracted by playing with a lovable leopard named Baby. If George and Baby weren't enough to drive Grant to wish he was extinct like the dinosaurs, then Hepburn might, yet there is something about this dizzy heiress that makes him remember that he's a man, not a bone chaser. O.K., I admit that I would be greatly annoyed to be stalked by a character as wacko and interfering as Hepburn, but watching Grant deal with her is a delightfully witty voyage. From the moment she steals his golf ball, dents his car, then tears his tuxedo jacket, you know she's attached to him like glue to a Popsicle stick. And when he accidentally retaliates and rips her dress, that sticky situation leads to even more. They are not quite the only insane ones here. Everybody has some neurotic disorder about them, even the psychiatrist (Fritz Feld) whom Hepburn and Grant encounter in a fancy restaurant and later in the country where Baby has taken up temporary residence on Feld's roof. May Robson is perplexed from the moment she sees Grant wearing a frilly ladies' robe, and Charles Ruggles adds more befuddlement into the mix when he shows up. A dipsomaniac caretaker (Barry Fitzgerald), frustrated sheriff (Walter Catlett) and Grant's jilted fianc&eacute;e (Tala Birell) are others involved in this mix, which also includes a second leopard whom even Baby might run from if they were to encounter each other in the dark. Director Howard Hawks mixes everything together seamlessly, resulting in a film of sheer perfection. Why this flopped in its initial release has never really been identified, except perhaps that Hepburn's involvement in a comedy after so many serious dramas seemed like something to skip as a misguided shot in the dark. She really proves her meddle in comedy when she pretends to be a gangster's moll, utilizing an accent that is downright hysterical. But the movie audiences in 1938 would have to wait for its rediscovery later on, and like so many other films, this one has risen above its initial failure to become one of the all-time classics, a pleasure from start to finish. Peter Bogdanovich's "What's Up Doc?" pretty much updated the plot, replacing the two leopards with identical suitcases, yet utilizing the same ensemble types of wackos to make it almost equally as enjoyable and one of the best modern comedy classics.

    Directed by one of the golden age's most prolific directors and featuring two of its biggest stars, Howard Hawks' Bringing Up Baby (1938) tells the story of David (Cary Grant), a paleontologist who's led into a series of zany events by the wild and bubbly Susan (Rita Hayworth). The bare-bones plot involves David having to retrieve a dinosaur bone for his museum from Susan's dog while the two try to manage Susan's pet leopard (the titular "Baby"). Presented via Hawk's trademark dry and no-frills directing style, Bringing Up Baby is an often funny but ultimately grating experience. The film has some great positives; it really shines in a few stand-out comedic scenes. One sees David attempting to save an ignorant Susan from embarrassment in a restaurant, and another an awkward dinner table scene that makes perfect use of dramatic irony for hilarious effect. Each of these scenes are meticulously crafted and extremely entertaining in their own right. To many critics, the film's box infamous office failure remains something of an enigma. Despite extremely positive reception from test screenings, the film failed to make its budget back during its initial run. Hawks himself felt the film "had a great fault and I learned an awful lot from that. There were no normal people in it. Everyone you met was a screwball and since that time I have learned my lesson and I don't intend ever again to make everybody crazy". I agree. There isn't a single relatable feature in any of the film's characters, and as a result it feels emotionally void. We're supposed to believe that the gawky David needs the irresponsible Susan to show him how to have fun, and that Susan needs a man to marry, but the lack of any emotional investment means the film plays out unconvincingly and the plot feels simply set up in order to allow for crazy antics to happen. This isn't helped by the movie's cut-throat pace, which, while moving things along quickly, leaves little room for character and story development, and little breathing room for the audience. Combined with the constant machine-gun like barrage of words pouring from the actor's mouth, the movie can be quite irritating, even at its modest runtime of 102 minutes. In fact, Bringing Up Baby may be a film more interesting than entertaining. Typical of the screwball comedy, gender roles are reversed, with a male character of questionable masculinity suffering from a dominant woman who makes his life misery. Of course, they fall in love in at the end. What sets this film apart however, is Hawks' ability to take this reversal to new extremes. Martin Scorsese calls directors who manage to slip in messages pass censorship "smugglers", and in Bringing Up Baby Hawk's luggage is positively stuffed. Having a great understanding of the genre after his film Twentieth Century (1934) acted as a prototype for it, Hawks uses phallic and fetishized imagery to chart his male protagonists' quest for manliness, the most obvious being the dinosaur "bone", that, from a modern perspective, are quite shocking to see in a film made during a very conservative time in America. Also quite shocking is the amount of power women hold. David is almost always interrupted by a female character and its Susan's aunt who holds the million dollars that David needs for his museum, in addition to the bone. Hepburn's character is even seen wearing pants in a few scenes, not a dress or skirt. A rare sight in 1930s cinema. Furthermore, several historians believe the film contains one of the first mainstream uses of the word "gay" in a homosexual context, improvised by Grant during a very funny scene involving his character unwillingly wearing a women's n&eacute;glig&eacute;e. Another very funny scene involves Grant's David trying to buy a large sirloin steak for the leopard. Perhaps the experience of watching Bringing Up Baby can be summarised by the experience of eating a giant steak. At first you're excited by the humour and innovation of having a steak so big, but after a reasonable number of bites, you just want to eat something else.

    I think this is one of the most pathetic of Katherine Hepburn's movie I have ever seen. I had a feeling her movies are overrated, but this movie beats them all. What surprises me is that this movie is in IMDb's top 250 list. How can anybody rating this movie be so oblivious to aesthetic sense. Depicting comedy or errors is always welcome, but the errors in this movie aren't comical, they get irritating. The plot is as flimsy as they come, twists all repetitive and copied from previous movies. I had to summon all the patience I have got just to get through this movie. One thing I recall wondering most while watching this movie -- Is this lousy movie ever gonna end!

    Film Review  Bringing Up Baby Howard Hawk's screwball comedy, Bringing Up Baby (1938), that entails a series of misunderstandings occurring one after the other between a polite paleontologist, a gorgeous clumsy woman and a leopard named Baby. After their run in at a golf course, Susan (Katharine Hepburn) convinces David (Cary Grant) to help take care of her auntie's pet leopard, as she believes David is a zoologist rather than a paleontologist. A series of comical errors ensue throughout the film played out by excellent overall performances by the entire cast. The plot was at times very frustrating to follow, due to the absurd misunderstandings that consist of stupidity too hard to believe. This is most prominent towards the end when somehow everyone involved ends up in trouble with the police. However, aside from that, the film is a joy to watch for the brilliant acting and screen presence of Cary Grant and for the wonderful comic timing by Katharine Hepburn. Hepburn and Grant share great on-screen chemistry which at first seems to elicit the dynamic of a brother/sister friendship. Though as the film progresses, their bizarre relationship unfolds into quite an unlikely romance that didn't seem entirely convincing. In many scenes, Hawks and the editor, George Hively, deliberately showed long durations between cuts, eliciting a dynamic that resonates with an on-stage play. This decision was cleverly made to accentuate the acting skills of the cast members, particularly Hepburn and Grant. The camera lets the comedy unfold through their performances without interruption. This technique allows them the freedom that two great actors require to get the best out of their talents. It is a technique that has since been used throughout cinema for decades. Bringing Up Baby is a classical film that consists of good writing, great comic performances and many laughs along the way.

    Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant star in this inspired comedy about a madcap heiress with a pet leopard who meets an absent-minded paleontologist and unwittingly makes a fiasco of both their lives.Bringing Up Baby is an comedy that is directed by Howard Hawks.Charles Ruggles,Walter Catlett,May Robson and Fritz Feld co-star to play key supporting roles.The screenplay was adapted by Dudley Nichols and Hagar Wilde from a short story by Wilde that originally appeared in Collier's Weekly magazine. David Huxley is the stuffy paleontologist who needs to finish an exhibit on dinosaurs and thus land a $1 million grant for his museum. At a golf outing with his potential benefactors, Huxley is spotted by Susan Vance who decides that she must have the reserved scientist at all costs. She uses her pet leopard, Baby, to trick him into driving to her Connecticut home, where a dog wanders into Huxley's room and steals the vital last bone that he needs to complete his project. The real trouble begins when another leopard escapes from the local zoo and Baby is mistaken for it, leading Huxley and Susan into a series of harebrained and increasingly more insane schemes to save the cat from the authorities. Inevitably, the two end up in the local jail, where things get even more out of hand: Susan pretends to be the gun moll to David's diabolical, supposedly wanted criminal. Naturally, the mismatched pair falls in love through all the lunacy. This film is a total delight, and the performances are so invigorating that it can withstand many multiple viewings without losing its sparks.With Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant at their effervescent best, it is a seamlessly assembled comedy with enduring appeal.Director Howard Hawks plays the complications as a breathless escalation of their "love impulse," yet the movie is nonetheless romantic for all its speed. And going back to the lead stars,Grant and Hepburn are a match made in movie heaven, in sync with each other throughout.Added to that,this narrative and thematic directions have much in common with those of Shakespearean comedy.Though it's almost impossible, try to sit back sometime and enjoy this Howard Hawks masterpiece not only for its gags, but for the grace of its construction, the assurance of its style, and the richness of its themes.

    There are a lot of films from the 1930s and 1940s that are incorrectly referred to a screwball comedies. This film ought to almost be considered the textbook example of a screwball comedy. Unfortunately, Howard Hawks, the director, didn't even quite get his own film! He though it didn't work because there were no normal characters in the film...which exactly makes it a screwball comedy. Think of our two main characters. Cary Grant who is a brilliant scientist with very few social skills. Katherine Hepburn who has no intellectual prowess whatsoever, but who has oodles of social skills, though they are a bit unusual. A perfect pairing. Then you have Hepburn's aunt, who now owns a leopard as a pet...who is running after Charles Ruggles, a big game hunter (of sorts). And then you have dinosaur bones versus a dog. What more do you need for a screwball comedy? One of the funniest scenes in film is in this movie -- where Katerine Hepburn's dress falls apart, and he covers it up first with his top hat, and then with his own body...as they walk through a ritzy restaurant! This comedic role is one of Grant's best. His acrobatic/athletic skills fit some of the slapstick perfectly, and his general demeanor is what you never see in any other Cary Grant role. Hepburn reportedly had a lot of difficulty with the comedy, but she comes across well as an almost total airhead. The primary supporting cast is terrific -- May Robson as the eccentric aunt, Charles Ruggles good as the big-game hunter, and a couple of great scenes with veteran comic actor Walter Catlett as a constable. You'll briefly see some other faces -- Ward Bond, and Barry Fitzgerald has a small part. Most every scene in this film made me at least smile, and a few times I laughed out loud, and that's something I rarely do. I wasn't thrilled with the swinging ladder scene at the close of the movie. That was just stupid, and they could have gotten to the same conclusion with something that would have seemed more realistically possible. But, overall, the movie's a gem...a true screwball comedy.

    Animals play a significant role in Bringing Up Baby, not just in terms of adding to comic situations, but also operating as metaphors for l'amour fou (crazy love). When we first meet him, palaeontologist David Huxley (Grant) is preparing to marry his co-worker Alice Swallow (Walker). Alice, we learn, is a rational, no-nonsense woman who sees marriage as a convenient and rational transaction rather than as an expression of love. As the film opens, David and Alice are putting the final touches on a brontosaurus skeleton that he has been working on for five years. The skeleton seems to be a symbol of the couple's relationship - dry, brittle, tenuous, old and, most importantly, dead. Enter Susan Vance (Hepburn), whose wild anarchic nature is just what the doctor ordered. She seems, on the surface, hair-brained - and this may be true - but her ditziness is the result of being absolutely, utterly, ridiculously head-over-heals in love (at first sight, as is the case with most l'amour fou scenarios) with David and doing whatever she can to sabotage his plans to marry Alice. Susan's leopard, named Baby, is the symbol of her love for David, for the moment the leopard lays its eyes on him, it is instantly affectionate and follows him around, just as Susan does. Jittery David is, of course, terrified of the beast and all that it represents. The leopard becomes an increasingly useful symbol as the film continues. At her aunt's estate in Connecticut, Susan releases another leopard its cage, thinking it is Baby captured by zoo officials when in fact it is a rogue leopard from the circus on its way to be gassed after attacking someone. With two leopards on the loose, the analogy becomes unmistakable - the wild leopard that Susan releases is David's libido, free at last after being repressed for so long in a loveless relationship. Indeed, towards the end of the film, when the wild leopard traps the host of characters in the local jail, it is nervous, terrified David who steps up and boldly saves the day. This I suppose is just one way of reading and enjoying a film like Bringing Up Baby. i think it's interesting that the film announces its interested in exploring psychoanalysis with the inclusion of a character who is a Freudian therapist (Dr Lehman played by Fritz Feld). Psychoanalysis was, of course, very popular among Hollywood screenwriters between the 30s and 50s who adopted all manner of coded symbols for sex after Joseph Breen's Production Code so tightly reasserted control over what could and couldn't be represented on screen. But the fact that Dr Lehman's diagnoses are so far off tells us that the science of the mind is no match for the power of l'amour fou, which turns men and women into wild, irrational carnal beasts.

    Screwball Comedy finds in "Bringing Up Baby" one its most better-represented manifestos, and one its most classic ad pure incarnations. Starring Hollywood icons Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn, the film was directed by Howard Hawks, one of the most eclectic American directors, as he worked on movies of all kinds, from Gangsters to Westerns To Comedies. Arguably, "Bringing Up Baby" is the culmination of the comedic side of his career. David Huxley is a paleontologist trying to convince the lawyer of a rich woman, who will be giving away one million dollars, to give the money to his museum. Huxley in the meantime meets by chance a charmingly goofy woman, Susan, whom he doesn't like. But she in secret falls immediately for the man, and unintentionally makes his life hell as an excuse to have him close by: the morning after they meet, she calls for his help because in her apartment she has a leopard, which however is domesticated and causes really no harm. One clever plot scheme after the other brings the two into the home of Susan's aunt in Connecticut, who coincidentally (!) is the woman who is giving away the one million dollars. Since Huxley has already made a fool of himself in front of her, he tries to hide his true identity (with Susan's help), for the sake of the museum. Meanwhile, the leopard escapes. On one hand, it's a typical Hollywood film with improbable scenarios and perfectly adorable characters. One the other, it's a movie with the charm and wit of only the best of 1930's comedies; a faithful document of the time when "low-brow" humor meant slapstick and innocent silliness, instead of vulgarity and utter stupidity. But the story twists are so many and so cleverly assembled together that it's hardly low-brow comedy at all. After this, Hawks went further down his comedic career with the other big classic of his "His Girl Friday", also starring Grant.

Typical of the screwball comedy, gender roles are reversed, with a male character of questionable masculinity suffering from a dominant woman who makes his life misery. Of course, they fall in love in at the end. What sets this film apart however, is Hawks' ability to take this reversal to new extremes. Martin Scorsese calls directors who manage to slip in messages pass censorship "smugglers", and in Bringing Up Baby Hawk's luggage is positively stuffed. Having a great understanding of the genre after his film Twentieth Century (1934) acted as a prototype for it, Hawks uses phallic and fetishized imagery to chart his male protagonists' quest for manliness, the most obvious being the dinosaur "bone", that, from a modern perspective, are quite shocking to see in a film made during a very conservative time in America. Also quite shocking is the amount of power women hold. David is almost always interrupted by a female character and its Susan's aunt who holds the million dollars that David needs for his museum, in addition to the bone. Hepburn's character is even seen wearing pants in a few scenes, not a dress or skirt. A rare sight in 1930s cinema. Furthermore, several historians believe the film contains one of the first mainstream uses of the word "gay" in a homosexual context, improvised by Grant during a very funny scene involving his character unwillingly wearing a women's n&eacute;glig&eacute;e. Another very funny scene involves Grant's David trying to buy a large sirloin steak for the leopard. Perhaps the experience of watching Bringing Up Baby can be summarised by the experience of eating a giant steak. At first you're excited by the humour and innovation of having a steak so big, but after a reasonable number of bites, you just want to eat something else.

    I think this is one of the most pathetic of Katherine Hepburn's movie I have ever seen. I had a feeling her movies are overrated, but this movie beats them all. What surprises me is that this movie is in IMDb's top 250 list. How can anybody rating this movie be so oblivious to aesthetic sense. Depicting comedy or errors is always welcome, but the errors in this movie aren't comical, they get irritating. The plot is as flimsy as they come, twists all repetitive and copied from previous movies. I had to summon all the patience I have got just to get through this movie. One thing I recall wondering most while watching this movie -- Is this lousy movie ever gonna end!

    Film Review  Bringing Up Baby Howard Hawk's screwball comedy, Bringing Up Baby (1938), that entails a series of misunderstandings occurring one after the other between a polite paleontologist, a gorgeous clumsy woman and a leopard named Baby. After their run in at a golf course, Susan (Katharine Hepburn) convinces David (Cary Grant) to help take care of her auntie's pet leopard, as she believes David is a zoologist rather than a paleontologist. A series of comical errors ensue throughout the film played out by excellent overall performances by the entire cast. The plot was at times very frustrating to follow, due to the absurd misunderstandings that consist of stupidity too hard to believe. This is most prominent towards the end when somehow everyone involved ends up in trouble with the police. However, aside from that, the film is a joy to watch for the brilliant acting and screen presence of Cary Grant and for the wonderful comic timing by Katharine Hepburn. Hepburn and Grant share great on-screen chemistry which at first seems to elicit the dynamic of a brother/sister friendship. Though as the film progresses, their bizarre relationship unfolds into quite an unlikely romance that didn't seem entirely convincing. In many scenes, Hawks and the editor, George Hively, deliberately showed long durations between cuts, eliciting a dynamic that resonates with an on-stage play. This decision was cleverly made to accentuate the acting skills of the cast members, particularly Hepburn and Grant. The camera lets the comedy unfold through their performances without interruption. This technique allows them the freedom that two great actors require to get the best out of their talents. It is a technique that has since been used throughout cinema for decades. Bringing Up Baby is a classical film that consists of good writing, great comic performances and many laughs along the way.

    Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant star in this inspired comedy about a madcap heiress with a pet leopard who meets an absent-minded paleontologist and unwittingly makes a fiasco of both their lives.Bringing Up Baby is an comedy that is directed by Howard Hawks.Charles Ruggles,Walter Catlett,May Robson and Fritz Feld co-star to play key supporting roles.The screenplay was adapted by Dudley Nichols and Hagar Wilde from a short story by Wilde that originally appeared in Collier's Weekly magazine. David Huxley is the stuffy paleontologist who needs to finish an exhibit on dinosaurs and thus land a $1 million grant for his museum. At a golf outing with his potential benefactors, Huxley is spotted by Susan Vance who decides that she must have the reserved scientist at all costs. She uses her pet leopard, Baby, to trick him into driving to her Connecticut home, where a dog wanders into Huxley's room and steals the vital last bone that he needs to complete his project. The real trouble begins when another leopard escapes from the local zoo and Baby is mistaken for it, leading Huxley and Susan into a series of harebrained and increasingly more insane schemes to save the cat from the authorities. Inevitably, the two end up in the local jail, where things get even more out of hand: Susan pretends to be the gun moll to David's diabolical, supposedly wanted criminal. Naturally, the mismatched pair falls in love through all the lunacy. This film is a total delight, and the performances are so invigorating that it can withstand many multiple viewings without losing its sparks.With Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant at their effervescent best, it is a seamlessly assembled comedy with enduring appeal.Director Howard Hawks plays the complications as a breathless escalation of their "love impulse," yet the movie is nonetheless romantic for all its speed. And going back to the lead stars,Grant and Hepburn are a match made in movie heaven, in sync with each other throughout.Added to that,this narrative and thematic directions have much in common with those of Shakespearean comedy.Though it's almost impossible, try to sit back sometime and enjoy this Howard Hawks masterpiece not only for its gags, but for the grace of its construction, the assurance of its style, and the richness of its themes.

    There are a lot of films from the 1930s and 1940s that are incorrectly referred to a screwball comedies. This film ought to almost be considered the textbook example of a screwball comedy. Unfortunately, Howard Hawks, the director, didn't even quite get his own film! He though it didn't work because there were no normal characters in the film...which exactly makes it a screwball comedy. Think of our two main characters. Cary Grant who is a brilliant scientist with very few social skills. Katherine Hepburn who has no intellectual prowess whatsoever, but who has oodles of social skills, though they are a bit unusual. A perfect pairing. Then you have Hepburn's aunt, who now owns a leopard as a pet...who is running after Charles Ruggles, a big game hunter (of sorts). And then you have dinosaur bones versus a dog. What more do you need for a screwball comedy? One of the funniest scenes in film is in this movie -- where Katerine Hepburn's dress falls apart, and he covers it up first with his top hat, and then with his own body...as they walk through a ritzy restaurant! This comedic role is one of Grant's best. His acrobatic/athletic skills fit some of the slapstick perfectly, and his general demeanor is what you never see in any other Cary Grant role. Hepburn reportedly had a lot of difficulty with the comedy, but she comes across well as an almost total airhead. The primary supporting cast is terrific -- May Robson as the eccentric aunt, Charles Ruggles good as the big-game hunter, and a couple of great scenes with veteran comic actor Walter Catlett as a constable. You'll briefly see some other faces -- Ward Bond, and Barry Fitzgerald has a small part. Most every scene in this film made me at least smile, and a few times I laughed out loud, and that's something I rarely do. I wasn't thrilled with the swinging ladder scene at the close of the movie. That was just stupid, and they could have gotten to the same conclusion with something that would have seemed more realistically possible. But, overall, the movie's a gem...a true screwball comedy.

    Animals play a significant role in Bringing Up Baby, not just in terms of adding to comic situations, but also operating as metaphors for l'amour fou (crazy love). When we first meet him, palaeontologist David Huxley (Grant) is preparing to marry his co-worker Alice Swallow (Walker). Alice, we learn, is a rational, no-nonsense woman who sees marriage as a convenient and rational transaction rather than as an expression of love. As the film opens, David and Alice are putting the final touches on a brontosaurus skeleton that he has been working on for five years. The skeleton seems to be a symbol of the couple's relationship - dry, brittle, tenuous, old and, most importantly, dead. Enter Susan Vance (Hepburn), whose wild anarchic nature is just what the doctor ordered. She seems, on the surface, hair-brained - and this may be true - but her ditziness is the result of being absolutely, utterly, ridiculously head-over-heals in love (at first sight, as is the case with most l'amour fou scenarios) with David and doing whatever she can to sabotage his plans to marry Alice. Susan's leopard, named Baby, is the symbol of her love for David, for the moment the leopard lays its eyes on him, it is instantly affectionate and follows him around, just as Susan does. Jittery David is, of course, terrified of the beast and all that it represents. The leopard becomes an increasingly useful symbol as the film continues. At her aunt's estate in Connecticut, Susan releases another leopard its cage, thinking it is Baby captured by zoo officials when in fact it is a rogue leopard from the circus on its way to be gassed after attacking someone. With two leopards on the loose, the analogy becomes unmistakable - the wild leopard that Susan releases is David's libido, free at last after being repressed for so long in a loveless relationship. Indeed, towards the end of the film, when the wild leopard traps the host of characters in the local jail, it is nervous, terrified David who steps up and boldly saves the day. This I suppose is just one way of reading and enjoying a film like Bringing Up Baby. i think it's interesting that the film announces its interested in exploring psychoanalysis with the inclusion of a character who is a Freudian therapist (Dr Lehman played by Fritz Feld). Psychoanalysis was, of course, very popular among Hollywood screenwriters between the 30s and 50s who adopted all manner of coded symbols for sex after Joseph Breen's Production Code so tightly reasserted control over what could and couldn't be represented on screen. But the fact that Dr Lehman's diagnoses are so far off tells us that the science of the mind is no match for the power of l'amour fou, which turns men and women into wild, irrational carnal beasts.

    Screwball Comedy finds in "Bringing Up Baby" one its most better-represented manifestos, and one its most classic ad pure incarnations. Starring Hollywood icons Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn, the film was directed by Howard Hawks, one of the most eclectic American directors, as he worked on movies of all kinds, from Gangsters to Westerns To Comedies. Arguably, "Bringing Up Baby" is the culmination of the comedic side of his career. David Huxley is a paleontologist trying to convince the lawyer of a rich woman, who will be giving away one million dollars, to give the money to his museum. Huxley in the meantime meets by chance a charmingly goofy woman, Susan, whom he doesn't like. But she in secret falls immediately for the man, and unintentionally makes his life hell as an excuse to have him close by: the morning after they meet, she calls for his help because in her apartment she has a leopard, which however is domesticated and causes really no harm. One clever plot scheme after the other brings the two into the home of Susan's aunt in Connecticut, who coincidentally (!) is the woman who is giving away the one million dollars. Since Huxley has already made a fool of himself in front of her, he tries to hide his true identity (with Susan's help), for the sake of the museum. Meanwhile, the leopard escapes. On one hand, it's a typical Hollywood film with improbable scenarios and perfectly adorable characters. One the other, it's a movie with the charm and wit of only the best of 1930's comedies; a faithful document of the time when "low-brow" humor meant slapstick and innocent silliness, instead of vulgarity and utter stupidity. But the story twists are so many and so cleverly assembled together that it's hardly low-brow comedy at all. After this, Hawks went further down his comedic career with the other big classic of his "His Girl Friday", also starring Grant.

    By design-of-nature and my environment of upbringing, I incline to keep a sensible mind with regard of viewing films, so when a screwball comedy goes it its extreme with uper-rapid pace and madcap characters, it is pretty understandable why initially this Howard Hawks film bombed tragically by its acceptance both commercially and critic-wisely, albeit Grant and Hepburn's dedicative endeavor, a well-crafted film script and its astonishing achievement of the animal (a leopard and a dog) performance (credits to their trainers as well). But now generally hailed as a paragon comedy by consensus, I wonder maybe I was born in a wrong era. I am not saying I dislike the film, it is a tongue-in-cheek urban tale which generates unsolicited laughters abound, but the off-putting disposition of Hepburn's Susan does impede me from fully appreciating this work. The story is a straight arrow zoology professor David (Grant) meets a scatterbrain wealthy girl Susan, who is inexplicably smitten with him, they first met in a golf field and without any context, once Susan sets her eyes on him, she is playing all the manipulative tricks to keep David from getting married and as stereotyped as it sounds, after a succession of zany slapsticks (mainly concerns finding a pet leopard and a barking dog), the two prove they really deserve each other. Grant is quite proficient in his usual orbit of a harmless gentleman with a double chin, plagued by laughter-induced mishaps when he is die hard trying to procure a million dollar donation for his museum, inconveniently the benefactor turns out to be Susan's auntie (Robson). Hepburn, never exemplifies herself as an excellent comedian, makes a great effort to match Grant's comic timing with her hotheaded whimsy, but the result is rather a hyperbole than a substantial stretch. Supporting players are basically expendable, Charles Ruggles' hunting-drivel-talking leopard-growl-mimicking dinner guest is the essence of what a bore a bourgeois boffin could be, and for whom we should all weep. Hawks manages to show off some camera artifices to shot the scenes between human cast and the carnivore feline, it is still magically done although we all witnessed the CGI tiger in LIFE OF PI (2012, 10/10) with awe and amazement, I suggest a remake with swapped sex, a well-heeled young man possessed with a priggish female zoologist, I doubt anyone could take the challenge, sex equality is still a halfway deal, and it goes without saying there will be a slew of CGI beasts around them.

    This is one of those films that you must re-visit perhaps once a year, because in spite of its place in Hollywood as a legendary failure (that resulted in Katharine Hepburn being listed as box office poison), it is one of the 10 funniest movies ever made. Hepburn and Cary Grant are an opposite sex version of Laurel and Hardy here, so dumb they're smart, and so over-the-top, you can't get enough of them. Grant is an expert on dinosaurs, and is missing the one important tail bone he needs to complete a 10-year project. That bone will go missing, thanks to George, a spunky pooch (who happens to look like Nick and Nora Charles' dog Asta) who grabs it then gets distracted by playing with a lovable leopard named Baby. If George and Baby weren't enough to drive Grant to wish he was extinct like the dinosaurs, then Hepburn might, yet there is something about this dizzy heiress that makes him remember that he's a man, not a bone chaser. O.K., I admit that I would be greatly annoyed to be stalked by a character as wacko and interfering as Hepburn, but watching Grant deal with her is a delightfully witty voyage. From the moment she steals his golf ball, dents his car, then tears his tuxedo jacket, you know she's attached to him like glue to a Popsicle stick. And when he accidentally retaliates and rips her dress, that sticky situation leads to even more. They are not quite the only insane ones here. Everybody has some neurotic disorder about them, even the psychiatrist (Fritz Feld) whom Hepburn and Grant encounter in a fancy restaurant and later in the country where Baby has taken up temporary residence on Feld's roof. May Robson is perplexed from the moment she sees Grant wearing a frilly ladies' robe, and Charles Ruggles adds more befuddlement into the mix when he shows up. A dipsomaniac caretaker (Barry Fitzgerald), frustrated sheriff (Walter Catlett) and Grant's jilted fianc&eacute;e (Tala Birell) are others involved in this mix, which also includes a second leopard whom even Baby might run from if they were to encounter each other in the dark. Director Howard Hawks mixes everything together seamlessly, resulting in a film of sheer perfection. Why this flopped in its initial release has never really been identified, except perhaps that Hepburn's involvement in a comedy after so many serious dramas seemed like something to skip as a misguided shot in the dark. She really proves her meddle in comedy when she pretends to be a gangster's moll, utilizing an accent that is downright hysterical. But the movie audiences in 1938 would have to wait for its rediscovery later on, and like so many other films, this one has risen above its initial failure to become one of the all-time classics, a pleasure from start to finish. Peter Bogdanovich's "What's Up Doc?" pretty much updated the plot, replacing the two leopards with identical suitcases, yet utilizing the same ensemble types of wackos to make it almost equally as enjoyable and one of the best modern comedy classics.

    if you believe than all "30 years comedies are same fruit basket, you are wrong. if you see Katherine Hepburn only as feminism icon, you make a great mistake. because this film is out of ordinaries rules. a great, amazing, chaotic, seductive comedy. out of expectations, full of flavor of its period but, in same time, real special. it is an adorable surprise. nothing more. a man, a woman and a lot of crazy adventures. entertainment but, in same measure, a story of love with different bricks and spices. it has something from Russian comedies but, in same time, it respects the law of Hollywood. a precise chaos. that is it. like a firework. or, only, like a splendid birthday cake.

    Directed by one of the golden age's most prolific directors and featuring two of its biggest stars, Howard Hawks' Bringing Up Baby (1938) tells the story of David (Cary Grant), a paleontologist who's led into a series of zany events by the wild and bubbly Susan (Rita Hayworth). The bare-bones plot involves David having to retrieve a dinosaur bone for his museum from Susan's dog while the two try to manage Susan's pet leopard (the titular "Baby"). Presented via Hawk's trademark dry and no-frills directing style, Bringing Up Baby is an often funny but ultimately grating experience. The film has some great positives; it really shines in a few stand-out comedic scenes. One sees David attempting to save an ignorant Susan from embarrassment in a restaurant, and another an awkward dinner table scene that makes perfect use of dramatic irony for hilarious effect. Each of these scenes are meticulously crafted and extremely entertaining in their own right. To many critics, the film's box infamous office failure remains something of an enigma. Despite extremely positive reception from test screenings, the film failed to make its budget back during its initial run. Hawks himself felt the film "had a great fault and I learned an awful lot from that. There were no normal people in it. Everyone you met was a screwball and since that time I have learned my lesson and I don't intend ever again to make everybody crazy". I agree. There isn't a single relatable feature in any of the film's characters, and as a result it feels emotionally void. We're supposed to believe that the gawky David needs the irresponsible Susan to show him how to have fun, and that Susan needs a man to marry, but the lack of any emotional investment means the film plays out unconvincingly and the plot feels simply set up in order to allow for crazy antics to happen. This isn't helped by the movie's cut-throat pace, which, while moving things along quickly, leaves little room for character and story development, and little breathing room for the audience. Combined with the constant machine-gun like barrage of words pouring from the actor's mouth, the movie can be quite irritating, even at its modest runtime of 102 minutes. In fact, Bringing Up Baby may be a film more interesting than entertaining. Typical of the screwball comedy, gender roles are reversed, with a male character of questionable masculinity suffering from a dominant woman who makes his life misery. Of course, they fall in love in at the end. What sets this film apart however, is Hawks' ability to take this reversal to new extremes. Martin Scorsese calls directors who manage to slip in messages pass censorship "smugglers", and in Bringing Up Baby Hawk's luggage is positively stuffed. Having a great understanding of the genre after his film Twentieth Century (1934) acted as a prototype for it, Hawks uses phallic and fetishized imagery to chart his male protagonists' quest for manliness, the most obvious being the dinosaur "bone", that, from a modern perspective, are quite shocking to see in a film made during a very conservative time in America. Also quite shocking is the amount of power women hold. David is almost always interrupted by a female character and its Susan's aunt who holds the million dollars that David needs for his museum, in addition to the bone. Hepburn's character is even seen wearing pants in a few scenes, not a dress or skirt. A rare sight in 1930s cinema. Furthermore, several historians believe the film contains one of the first mainstream uses of the word "gay" in a homosexual context, improvised by Grant during a very funny scene involving his character unwillingly wearing a women's n&eacute;glig&eacute;e. Another very funny scene involves Grant's David trying to buy a large sirloin steak for the leopard.

The primary supporting cast is terrific -- May Robson as the eccentric aunt, Charles Ruggles good as the big-game hunter, and a couple of great scenes with veteran comic actor Walter Catlett as a constable. You'll briefly see some other faces -- Ward Bond, and Barry Fitzgerald has a small part. Most every scene in this film made me at least smile, and a few times I laughed out loud, and that's something I rarely do. I wasn't thrilled with the swinging ladder scene at the close of the movie. That was just stupid, and they could have gotten to the same conclusion with something that would have seemed more realistically possible. But, overall, the movie's a gem...a true screwball comedy.

    Animals play a significant role in Bringing Up Baby, not just in terms of adding to comic situations, but also operating as metaphors for l'amour fou (crazy love). When we first meet him, palaeontologist David Huxley (Grant) is preparing to marry his co-worker Alice Swallow (Walker). Alice, we learn, is a rational, no-nonsense woman who sees marriage as a convenient and rational transaction rather than as an expression of love. As the film opens, David and Alice are putting the final touches on a brontosaurus skeleton that he has been working on for five years. The skeleton seems to be a symbol of the couple's relationship - dry, brittle, tenuous, old and, most importantly, dead. Enter Susan Vance (Hepburn), whose wild anarchic nature is just what the doctor ordered. She seems, on the surface, hair-brained - and this may be true - but her ditziness is the result of being absolutely, utterly, ridiculously head-over-heals in love (at first sight, as is the case with most l'amour fou scenarios) with David and doing whatever she can to sabotage his plans to marry Alice. Susan's leopard, named Baby, is the symbol of her love for David, for the moment the leopard lays its eyes on him, it is instantly affectionate and follows him around, just as Susan does. Jittery David is, of course, terrified of the beast and all that it represents. The leopard becomes an increasingly useful symbol as the film continues. At her aunt's estate in Connecticut, Susan releases another leopard its cage, thinking it is Baby captured by zoo officials when in fact it is a rogue leopard from the circus on its way to be gassed after attacking someone. With two leopards on the loose, the analogy becomes unmistakable - the wild leopard that Susan releases is David's libido, free at last after being repressed for so long in a loveless relationship. Indeed, towards the end of the film, when the wild leopard traps the host of characters in the local jail, it is nervous, terrified David who steps up and boldly saves the day. This I suppose is just one way of reading and enjoying a film like Bringing Up Baby. i think it's interesting that the film announces its interested in exploring psychoanalysis with the inclusion of a character who is a Freudian therapist (Dr Lehman played by Fritz Feld). Psychoanalysis was, of course, very popular among Hollywood screenwriters between the 30s and 50s who adopted all manner of coded symbols for sex after Joseph Breen's Production Code so tightly reasserted control over what could and couldn't be represented on screen. But the fact that Dr Lehman's diagnoses are so far off tells us that the science of the mind is no match for the power of l'amour fou, which turns men and women into wild, irrational carnal beasts.

    Screwball Comedy finds in "Bringing Up Baby" one its most better-represented manifestos, and one its most classic ad pure incarnations. Starring Hollywood icons Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn, the film was directed by Howard Hawks, one of the most eclectic American directors, as he worked on movies of all kinds, from Gangsters to Westerns To Comedies. Arguably, "Bringing Up Baby" is the culmination of the comedic side of his career. David Huxley is a paleontologist trying to convince the lawyer of a rich woman, who will be giving away one million dollars, to give the money to his museum. Huxley in the meantime meets by chance a charmingly goofy woman, Susan, whom he doesn't like. But she in secret falls immediately for the man, and unintentionally makes his life hell as an excuse to have him close by: the morning after they meet, she calls for his help because in her apartment she has a leopard, which however is domesticated and causes really no harm. One clever plot scheme after the other brings the two into the home of Susan's aunt in Connecticut, who coincidentally (!) is the woman who is giving away the one million dollars. Since Huxley has already made a fool of himself in front of her, he tries to hide his true identity (with Susan's help), for the sake of the museum. Meanwhile, the leopard escapes. On one hand, it's a typical Hollywood film with improbable scenarios and perfectly adorable characters. One the other, it's a movie with the charm and wit of only the best of 1930's comedies; a faithful document of the time when "low-brow" humor meant slapstick and innocent silliness, instead of vulgarity and utter stupidity. But the story twists are so many and so cleverly assembled together that it's hardly low-brow comedy at all. After this, Hawks went further down his comedic career with the other big classic of his "His Girl Friday", also starring Grant.

    By design-of-nature and my environment of upbringing, I incline to keep a sensible mind with regard of viewing films, so when a screwball comedy goes it its extreme with uper-rapid pace and madcap characters, it is pretty understandable why initially this Howard Hawks film bombed tragically by its acceptance both commercially and critic-wisely, albeit Grant and Hepburn's dedicative endeavor, a well-crafted film script and its astonishing achievement of the animal (a leopard and a dog) performance (credits to their trainers as well). But now generally hailed as a paragon comedy by consensus, I wonder maybe I was born in a wrong era. I am not saying I dislike the film, it is a tongue-in-cheek urban tale which generates unsolicited laughters abound, but the off-putting disposition of Hepburn's Susan does impede me from fully appreciating this work. The story is a straight arrow zoology professor David (Grant) meets a scatterbrain wealthy girl Susan, who is inexplicably smitten with him, they first met in a golf field and without any context, once Susan sets her eyes on him, she is playing all the manipulative tricks to keep David from getting married and as stereotyped as it sounds, after a succession of zany slapsticks (mainly concerns finding a pet leopard and a barking dog), the two prove they really deserve each other. Grant is quite proficient in his usual orbit of a harmless gentleman with a double chin, plagued by laughter-induced mishaps when he is die hard trying to procure a million dollar donation for his museum, inconveniently the benefactor turns out to be Susan's auntie (Robson). Hepburn, never exemplifies herself as an excellent comedian, makes a great effort to match Grant's comic timing with her hotheaded whimsy, but the result is rather a hyperbole than a substantial stretch. Supporting players are basically expendable, Charles Ruggles' hunting-drivel-talking leopard-growl-mimicking dinner guest is the essence of what a bore a bourgeois boffin could be, and for whom we should all weep. Hawks manages to show off some camera artifices to shot the scenes between human cast and the carnivore feline, it is still magically done although we all witnessed the CGI tiger in LIFE OF PI (2012, 10/10) with awe and amazement, I suggest a remake with swapped sex, a well-heeled young man possessed with a priggish female zoologist, I doubt anyone could take the challenge, sex equality is still a halfway deal, and it goes without saying there will be a slew of CGI beasts around them.

    This is one of those films that you must re-visit perhaps once a year, because in spite of its place in Hollywood as a legendary failure (that resulted in Katharine Hepburn being listed as box office poison), it is one of the 10 funniest movies ever made. Hepburn and Cary Grant are an opposite sex version of Laurel and Hardy here, so dumb they're smart, and so over-the-top, you can't get enough of them. Grant is an expert on dinosaurs, and is missing the one important tail bone he needs to complete a 10-year project. That bone will go missing, thanks to George, a spunky pooch (who happens to look like Nick and Nora Charles' dog Asta) who grabs it then gets distracted by playing with a lovable leopard named Baby. If George and Baby weren't enough to drive Grant to wish he was extinct like the dinosaurs, then Hepburn might, yet there is something about this dizzy heiress that makes him remember that he's a man, not a bone chaser. O.K., I admit that I would be greatly annoyed to be stalked by a character as wacko and interfering as Hepburn, but watching Grant deal with her is a delightfully witty voyage. From the moment she steals his golf ball, dents his car, then tears his tuxedo jacket, you know she's attached to him like glue to a Popsicle stick. And when he accidentally retaliates and rips her dress, that sticky situation leads to even more. They are not quite the only insane ones here. Everybody has some neurotic disorder about them, even the psychiatrist (Fritz Feld) whom Hepburn and Grant encounter in a fancy restaurant and later in the country where Baby has taken up temporary residence on Feld's roof. May Robson is perplexed from the moment she sees Grant wearing a frilly ladies' robe, and Charles Ruggles adds more befuddlement into the mix when he shows up. A dipsomaniac caretaker (Barry Fitzgerald), frustrated sheriff (Walter Catlett) and Grant's jilted fianc&eacute;e (Tala Birell) are others involved in this mix, which also includes a second leopard whom even Baby might run from if they were to encounter each other in the dark. Director Howard Hawks mixes everything together seamlessly, resulting in a film of sheer perfection. Why this flopped in its initial release has never really been identified, except perhaps that Hepburn's involvement in a comedy after so many serious dramas seemed like something to skip as a misguided shot in the dark. She really proves her meddle in comedy when she pretends to be a gangster's moll, utilizing an accent that is downright hysterical. But the movie audiences in 1938 would have to wait for its rediscovery later on, and like so many other films, this one has risen above its initial failure to become one of the all-time classics, a pleasure from start to finish. Peter Bogdanovich's "What's Up Doc?" pretty much updated the plot, replacing the two leopards with identical suitcases, yet utilizing the same ensemble types of wackos to make it almost equally as enjoyable and one of the best modern comedy classics.

    if you believe than all "30 years comedies are same fruit basket, you are wrong. if you see Katherine Hepburn only as feminism icon, you make a great mistake. because this film is out of ordinaries rules. a great, amazing, chaotic, seductive comedy. out of expectations, full of flavor of its period but, in same time, real special. it is an adorable surprise. nothing more. a man, a woman and a lot of crazy adventures. entertainment but, in same measure, a story of love with different bricks and spices. it has something from Russian comedies but, in same time, it respects the law of Hollywood. a precise chaos. that is it. like a firework. or, only, like a splendid birthday cake.

    Directed by one of the golden age's most prolific directors and featuring two of its biggest stars, Howard Hawks' Bringing Up Baby (1938) tells the story of David (Cary Grant), a paleontologist who's led into a series of zany events by the wild and bubbly Susan (Rita Hayworth). The bare-bones plot involves David having to retrieve a dinosaur bone for his museum from Susan's dog while the two try to manage Susan's pet leopard (the titular "Baby"). Presented via Hawk's trademark dry and no-frills directing style, Bringing Up Baby is an often funny but ultimately grating experience. The film has some great positives; it really shines in a few stand-out comedic scenes. One sees David attempting to save an ignorant Susan from embarrassment in a restaurant, and another an awkward dinner table scene that makes perfect use of dramatic irony for hilarious effect. Each of these scenes are meticulously crafted and extremely entertaining in their own right. To many critics, the film's box infamous office failure remains something of an enigma. Despite extremely positive reception from test screenings, the film failed to make its budget back during its initial run. Hawks himself felt the film "had a great fault and I learned an awful lot from that. There were no normal people in it. Everyone you met was a screwball and since that time I have learned my lesson and I don't intend ever again to make everybody crazy". I agree. There isn't a single relatable feature in any of the film's characters, and as a result it feels emotionally void. We're supposed to believe that the gawky David needs the irresponsible Susan to show him how to have fun, and that Susan needs a man to marry, but the lack of any emotional investment means the film plays out unconvincingly and the plot feels simply set up in order to allow for crazy antics to happen. This isn't helped by the movie's cut-throat pace, which, while moving things along quickly, leaves little room for character and story development, and little breathing room for the audience. Combined with the constant machine-gun like barrage of words pouring from the actor's mouth, the movie can be quite irritating, even at its modest runtime of 102 minutes. In fact, Bringing Up Baby may be a film more interesting than entertaining. Typical of the screwball comedy, gender roles are reversed, with a male character of questionable masculinity suffering from a dominant woman who makes his life misery. Of course, they fall in love in at the end. What sets this film apart however, is Hawks' ability to take this reversal to new extremes. Martin Scorsese calls directors who manage to slip in messages pass censorship "smugglers", and in Bringing Up Baby Hawk's luggage is positively stuffed. Having a great understanding of the genre after his film Twentieth Century (1934) acted as a prototype for it, Hawks uses phallic and fetishized imagery to chart his male protagonists' quest for manliness, the most obvious being the dinosaur "bone", that, from a modern perspective, are quite shocking to see in a film made during a very conservative time in America. Also quite shocking is the amount of power women hold. David is almost always interrupted by a female character and its Susan's aunt who holds the million dollars that David needs for his museum, in addition to the bone. Hepburn's character is even seen wearing pants in a few scenes, not a dress or skirt. A rare sight in 1930s cinema. Furthermore, several historians believe the film contains one of the first mainstream uses of the word "gay" in a homosexual context, improvised by Grant during a very funny scene involving his character unwillingly wearing a women's n&eacute;glig&eacute;e. Another very funny scene involves Grant's David trying to buy a large sirloin steak for the leopard. Perhaps the experience of watching Bringing Up Baby can be summarised by the experience of eating a giant steak. At first you're excited by the humour and innovation of having a steak so big, but after a reasonable number of bites, you just want to eat something else.

    I think this is one of the most pathetic of Katherine Hepburn's movie I have ever seen. I had a feeling her movies are overrated, but this movie beats them all. What surprises me is that this movie is in IMDb's top 250 list. How can anybody rating this movie be so oblivious to aesthetic sense. Depicting comedy or errors is always welcome, but the errors in this movie aren't comical, they get irritating. The plot is as flimsy as they come, twists all repetitive and copied from previous movies. I had to summon all the patience I have got just to get through this movie. One thing I recall wondering most while watching this movie -- Is this lousy movie ever gonna end!

    Film Review  Bringing Up Baby Howard Hawk's screwball comedy, Bringing Up Baby (1938), that entails a series of misunderstandings occurring one after the other between a polite paleontologist, a gorgeous clumsy woman and a leopard named Baby. After their run in at a golf course, Susan (Katharine Hepburn) convinces David (Cary Grant) to help take care of her auntie's pet leopard, as she believes David is a zoologist rather than a paleontologist. A series of comical errors ensue throughout the film played out by excellent overall performances by the entire cast. The plot was at times very frustrating to follow, due to the absurd misunderstandings that consist of stupidity too hard to believe. This is most prominent towards the end when somehow everyone involved ends up in trouble with the police. However, aside from that, the film is a joy to watch for the brilliant acting and screen presence of Cary Grant and for the wonderful comic timing by Katharine Hepburn. Hepburn and Grant share great on-screen chemistry which at first seems to elicit the dynamic of a brother/sister friendship. Though as the film progresses, their bizarre relationship unfolds into quite an unlikely romance that didn't seem entirely convincing. In many scenes, Hawks and the editor, George Hively, deliberately showed long durations between cuts, eliciting a dynamic that resonates with an on-stage play. This decision was cleverly made to accentuate the acting skills of the cast members, particularly Hepburn and Grant. The camera lets the comedy unfold through their performances without interruption. This technique allows them the freedom that two great actors require to get the best out of their talents. It is a technique that has since been used throughout cinema for decades. Bringing Up Baby is a classical film that consists of good writing, great comic performances and many laughs along the way.

    Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant star in this inspired comedy about a madcap heiress with a pet leopard who meets an absent-minded paleontologist and unwittingly makes a fiasco of both their lives.Bringing Up Baby is an comedy that is directed by Howard Hawks.Charles Ruggles,Walter Catlett,May Robson and Fritz Feld co-star to play key supporting roles.The screenplay was adapted by Dudley Nichols and Hagar Wilde from a short story by Wilde that originally appeared in Collier's Weekly magazine. David Huxley is the stuffy paleontologist who needs to finish an exhibit on dinosaurs and thus land a $1 million grant for his museum. At a golf outing with his potential benefactors, Huxley is spotted by Susan Vance who decides that she must have the reserved scientist at all costs. She uses her pet leopard, Baby, to trick him into driving to her Connecticut home, where a dog wanders into Huxley's room and steals the vital last bone that he needs to complete his project. The real trouble begins when another leopard escapes from the local zoo and Baby is mistaken for it, leading Huxley and Susan into a series of harebrained and increasingly more insane schemes to save the cat from the authorities. Inevitably, the two end up in the local jail, where things get even more out of hand: Susan pretends to be the gun moll to David's diabolical, supposedly wanted criminal. Naturally, the mismatched pair falls in love through all the lunacy. This film is a total delight, and the performances are so invigorating that it can withstand many multiple viewings without losing its sparks.With Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant at their effervescent best, it is a seamlessly assembled comedy with enduring appeal.Director Howard Hawks plays the complications as a breathless escalation of their "love impulse," yet the movie is nonetheless romantic for all its speed. And going back to the lead stars,Grant and Hepburn are a match made in movie heaven, in sync with each other throughout.Added to that,this narrative and thematic directions have much in common with those of Shakespearean comedy.Though it's almost impossible, try to sit back sometime and enjoy this Howard Hawks masterpiece not only for its gags, but for the grace of its construction, the assurance of its style, and the richness of its themes.

    There are a lot of films from the 1930s and 1940s that are incorrectly referred to a screwball comedies. This film ought to almost be considered the textbook example of a screwball comedy. Unfortunately, Howard Hawks, the director, didn't even quite get his own film! He though it didn't work because there were no normal characters in the film...which exactly makes it a screwball comedy. Think of our two main characters. Cary Grant who is a brilliant scientist with very few social skills. Katherine Hepburn who has no intellectual prowess whatsoever, but who has oodles of social skills, though they are a bit unusual. A perfect pairing. Then you have Hepburn's aunt, who now owns a leopard as a pet...who is running after Charles Ruggles, a big game hunter (of sorts). And then you have dinosaur bones versus a dog. What more do you need for a screwball comedy? One of the funniest scenes in film is in this movie -- where Katerine Hepburn's dress falls apart, and he covers it up first with his top hat, and then with his own body...as they walk through a ritzy restaurant! This comedic role is one of Grant's best. His acrobatic/athletic skills fit some of the slapstick perfectly, and his general demeanor is what you never see in any other Cary Grant role. Hepburn reportedly had a lot of difficulty with the comedy, but she comes across well as an almost total airhead. The primary supporting cast is terrific -- May Robson as the eccentric aunt, Charles Ruggles good as the big-game hunter, and a couple of great scenes with veteran comic actor Walter Catlett as a constable. You'll briefly see some other faces -- Ward Bond, and Barry Fitzgerald has a small part. Most every scene in this film made me at least smile, and a few times I laughed out loud, and that's something I rarely do. I wasn't thrilled with the swinging ladder scene at the close of the movie. That was just stupid, and they could have gotten to the same conclusion with something that would have seemed more realistically possible. But, overall, the movie's a gem...a true screwball comedy.

    This is one of those films that you must re-visit perhaps once a year, because in spite of its place in Hollywood as a legendary failure (that resulted in Katharine Hepburn being listed as box office poison), it is one of the 10 funniest movies ever made. Hepburn and Cary Grant are an opposite sex version of Laurel and Hardy here, so dumb they're smart, and so over-the-top, you can't get enough of them. Grant is an expert on dinosaurs, and is missing the one important tail bone he needs to complete a 10-year project. That bone will go missing, thanks to George, a spunky pooch (who happens to look like Nick and Nora Charles' dog Asta) who grabs it then gets distracted by playing with a lovable leopard named Baby. If George and Baby weren't enough to drive Grant to wish he was extinct like the dinosaurs, then Hepburn might, yet there is something about this dizzy heiress that makes him remember that he's a man, not a bone chaser. O.K., I admit that I would be greatly annoyed to be stalked by a character as wacko and interfering as Hepburn, but watching Grant deal with her is a delightfully witty voyage. From the moment she steals his golf ball, dents his car, then tears his tuxedo jacket, you know she's attached to him like glue to a Popsicle stick. And when he accidentally retaliates and rips her dress, that sticky situation leads to even more. They are not quite the only insane ones here. Everybody has some neurotic disorder about them, even the psychiatrist (Fritz Feld) whom Hepburn and Grant encounter in a fancy restaurant and later in the country where Baby has taken up temporary residence on Feld's roof. May Robson is perplexed from the moment she sees Grant wearing a frilly ladies' robe, and Charles Ruggles adds more befuddlement into the mix when he shows up. A dipsomaniac caretaker (Barry Fitzgerald), frustrated sheriff (Walter Catlett) and Grant's jilted fianc&eacute;e (Tala Birell) are others involved in this mix, which also includes a second leopard whom even Baby might run from if they were to encounter each other in the dark. Director Howard Hawks mixes everything together seamlessly, resulting in a film of sheer perfection. Why this flopped in its initial release has never really been identified, except perhaps that Hepburn's involvement in a comedy after so many serious dramas seemed like something to skip as a misguided shot in the dark. She really proves her meddle in comedy when she pretends to be a gangster's moll, utilizing an accent that is downright hysterical. But the movie audiences in 1938 would have to wait for its rediscovery later on, and like so many other films, this one has risen above its initial failure to become one of the all-time classics, a pleasure from start to finish. Peter Bogdanovich's "What's Up Doc?" pretty much updated the plot, replacing the two leopards with identical suitcases, yet utilizing the same ensemble types of wackos to make it almost equally as enjoyable and one of the best modern comedy classics.

    if you believe than all "30 years comedies are same fruit basket, you are wrong. if you see Katherine Hepburn only as feminism icon, you make a great mistake. because this film is out of ordinaries rules. a great, amazing, chaotic, seductive comedy. out of expectations, full of flavor of its period but, in same time, real special. it is an adorable surprise. nothing more. a man, a woman and a lot of crazy adventures. entertainment but, in same measure, a story of love with different bricks and spices. it has something from Russian comedies but, in same time, it respects the law of Hollywood. a precise chaos. that is it. like a firework. or, only, like a splendid birthday cake.

    Directed by one of the golden age's most prolific directors and featuring two of its biggest stars, Howard Hawks' Bringing Up Baby (1938) tells the story of David (Cary Grant), a paleontologist who's led into a series of zany events by the wild and bubbly Susan (Rita Hayworth). The bare-bones plot involves David having to retrieve a dinosaur bone for his museum from Susan's dog while the two try to manage Susan's pet leopard (the titular "Baby"). Presented via Hawk's trademark dry and no-frills directing style, Bringing Up Baby is an often funny but ultimately grating experience. The film has some great positives; it really shines in a few stand-out comedic scenes. One sees David attempting to save an ignorant Susan from embarrassment in a restaurant, and another an awkward dinner table scene that makes perfect use of dramatic irony for hilarious effect. Each of these scenes are meticulously crafted and extremely entertaining in their own right. To many critics, the film's box infamous office failure remains something of an enigma. Despite extremely positive reception from test screenings, the film failed to make its budget back during its initial run. Hawks himself felt the film "had a great fault and I learned an awful lot from that. There were no normal people in it. Everyone you met was a screwball and since that time I have learned my lesson and I don't intend ever again to make everybody crazy". I agree. There isn't a single relatable feature in any of the film's characters, and as a result it feels emotionally void. We're supposed to believe that the gawky David needs the irresponsible Susan to show him how to have fun, and that Susan needs a man to marry, but the lack of any emotional investment means the film plays out unconvincingly and the plot feels simply set up in order to allow for crazy antics to happen. This isn't helped by the movie's cut-throat pace, which, while moving things along quickly, leaves little room for character and story development, and little breathing room for the audience. Combined with the constant machine-gun like barrage of words pouring from the actor's mouth, the movie can be quite irritating, even at its modest runtime of 102 minutes. In fact, Bringing Up Baby may be a film more interesting than entertaining. Typical of the screwball comedy, gender roles are reversed, with a male character of questionable masculinity suffering from a dominant woman who makes his life misery. Of course, they fall in love in at the end. What sets this film apart however, is Hawks' ability to take this reversal to new extremes. Martin Scorsese calls directors who manage to slip in messages pass censorship "smugglers", and in Bringing Up Baby Hawk's luggage is positively stuffed. Having a great understanding of the genre after his film Twentieth Century (1934) acted as a prototype for it, Hawks uses phallic and fetishized imagery to chart his male protagonists' quest for manliness, the most obvious being the dinosaur "bone", that, from a modern perspective, are quite shocking to see in a film made during a very conservative time in America. Also quite shocking is the amount of power women hold. David is almost always interrupted by a female character and its Susan's aunt who holds the million dollars that David needs for his museum, in addition to the bone. Hepburn's character is even seen wearing pants in a few scenes, not a dress or skirt. A rare sight in 1930s cinema. Furthermore, several historians believe the film contains one of the first mainstream uses of the word "gay" in a homosexual context, improvised by Grant during a very funny scene involving his character unwillingly wearing a women's n&eacute;glig&eacute;e. Another very funny scene involves Grant's David trying to buy a large sirloin steak for the leopard. Perhaps the experience of watching Bringing Up Baby can be summarised by the experience of eating a giant steak. At first you're excited by the humour and innovation of having a steak so big, but after a reasonable number of bites, you just want to eat something else.

    I think this is one of the most pathetic of Katherine Hepburn's movie I have ever seen. I had a feeling her movies are overrated, but this movie beats them all. What surprises me is that this movie is in IMDb's top 250 list. How can anybody rating this movie be so oblivious to aesthetic sense. Depicting comedy or errors is always welcome, but the errors in this movie aren't comical, they get irritating. The plot is as flimsy as they come, twists all repetitive and copied from previous movies. I had to summon all the patience I have got just to get through this movie. One thing I recall wondering most while watching this movie -- Is this lousy movie ever gonna end!

    Film Review  Bringing Up Baby Howard Hawk's screwball comedy, Bringing Up Baby (1938), that entails a series of misunderstandings occurring one after the other between a polite paleontologist, a gorgeous clumsy woman and a leopard named Baby. After their run in at a golf course, Susan (Katharine Hepburn) convinces David (Cary Grant) to help take care of her auntie's pet leopard, as she believes David is a zoologist rather than a paleontologist. A series of comical errors ensue throughout the film played out by excellent overall performances by the entire cast. The plot was at times very frustrating to follow, due to the absurd misunderstandings that consist of stupidity too hard to believe. This is most prominent towards the end when somehow everyone involved ends up in trouble with the police. However, aside from that, the film is a joy to watch for the brilliant acting and screen presence of Cary Grant and for the wonderful comic timing by Katharine Hepburn. Hepburn and Grant share great on-screen chemistry which at first seems to elicit the dynamic of a brother/sister friendship. Though as the film progresses, their bizarre relationship unfolds into quite an unlikely romance that didn't seem entirely convincing. In many scenes, Hawks and the editor, George Hively, deliberately showed long durations between cuts, eliciting a dynamic that resonates with an on-stage play. This decision was cleverly made to accentuate the acting skills of the cast members, particularly Hepburn and Grant. The camera lets the comedy unfold through their performances without interruption. This technique allows them the freedom that two great actors require to get the best out of their talents. It is a technique that has since been used throughout cinema for decades. Bringing Up Baby is a classical film that consists of good writing, great comic performances and many laughs along the way.

    Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant star in this inspired comedy about a madcap heiress with a pet leopard who meets an absent-minded paleontologist and unwittingly makes a fiasco of both their lives.Bringing Up Baby is an comedy that is directed by Howard Hawks.Charles Ruggles,Walter Catlett,May Robson and Fritz Feld co-star to play key supporting roles.The screenplay was adapted by Dudley Nichols and Hagar Wilde from a short story by Wilde that originally appeared in Collier's Weekly magazine. David Huxley is the stuffy paleontologist who needs to finish an exhibit on dinosaurs and thus land a $1 million grant for his museum. At a golf outing with his potential benefactors, Huxley is spotted by Susan Vance who decides that she must have the reserved scientist at all costs. She uses her pet leopard, Baby, to trick him into driving to her Connecticut home, where a dog wanders into Huxley's room and steals the vital last bone that he needs to complete his project. The real trouble begins when another leopard escapes from the local zoo and Baby is mistaken for it, leading Huxley and Susan into a series of harebrained and increasingly more insane schemes to save the cat from the authorities. Inevitably, the two end up in the local jail, where things get even more out of hand: Susan pretends to be the gun moll to David's diabolical, supposedly wanted criminal. Naturally, the mismatched pair falls in love through all the lunacy. This film is a total delight, and the performances are so invigorating that it can withstand many multiple viewings without losing its sparks.With Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant at their effervescent best, it is a seamlessly assembled comedy with enduring appeal.Director Howard Hawks plays the complications as a breathless escalation of their "love impulse," yet the movie is nonetheless romantic for all its speed. And going back to the lead stars,Grant and Hepburn are a match made in movie heaven, in sync with each other throughout.Added to that,this narrative and thematic directions have much in common with those of Shakespearean comedy.Though it's almost impossible, try to sit back sometime and enjoy this Howard Hawks masterpiece not only for its gags, but for the grace of its construction, the assurance of its style, and the richness of its themes.
