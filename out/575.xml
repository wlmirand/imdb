 <sinopse>
  Shortly after their first western adventure, Mitch Robbins and his friends discover a treasure map that belonged to their late trail guide Curly and set out to discover its secrets.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  The second part of City Slickers begins after the death of Curly. It is the 40th birthday of Mitch Robbins and the day begins quite good until he returns home (after a hard day at the radio station) and finds his brother Glen, the black sheep of the family, in his sofa. Nevertheless he is about to have a wonderful birthday-night with his wife when he discovers a treasure map of Curly by chance. Together with Phil (from the first part) and unfortunately with Glen he tries to find the hidden gold of Curly's father in the desert of Arizona instead of attending a meeting in Las Vegas. The adventurous journey reveals many surprises until everything seems to be over when the map gets lost...

    Billy Crystal, Jack Palance, Daniel Stern, Jon Lovitz, Patricia Wettig and Noble Willingham star in this 1994 comedy sequel. This takes place a year after the first film where Mitch is now living in the country near New York and is radio station manager. He starts having bad dreams about late cowboy, Curly (Palance) and thinks he's alive. His friend, Phil (Stern) is now divorced and his brother, Glen (Lovitz) is looking for a handout. While Mitch celebrates his 40th birthday, he finds a treasure map inside Curly's hat. Mitch talks with Phil and they decide to hunt for the treasure that Curly kept secret. Glen joins them and they meet Curly's twin brother, Duke (Palance) who helps them search for the treasure. Wettig returns as Mitch's wife, Barbara and Willingham returns as Clay Stone. I think this is a good sequel with a good cast and recommend it.

    You can probably tell from the review title that I absolutely loved the first film, the sentimentality occasionally got in the way, but it was funny, beautifully filmed and had adept direction and performances. I admit I was disappointed in this sequel, but there are much worse sequels out there, reading my past reviews you'll probably guess which ones I'm talking about. The film is beautiful to watch with a nice score, and the ending was great. And there were some funny moments, if not anything that I would quote like in the first. Plus the performances are good, Jack Palance makes a brief but worthwhile reprisal here, and Daniel Stern is as goofy and as charming as ever. Billy Crystal is much more reserved here though, and Jon Lovitz did irritate me. The flaws however come in mainly the basic plot structure, I know the first film had a simple story structure but this one had more so and the direction which isn't as skillful or as efficient this time around. Another problem was the pacing, while the film's length itself is fine there are times when the film does drag and badly. As I have said already there were times when I did laugh, but for me it wasn't quite enough. Overall, not an awful sequel, but it was disappointing. 5/10 Bethany Cox

    A lot of the time I avoid sequels to successful comedies, but "City Slickers II" received some fairly good ratings, so I decided to check it out. Unfortunately, I found this film just not funny or emotional enough, and it felt a bit unoriginal. There are some things that had potential, such as Billy Crystal thinking he sees his old friend Curly at several places, as well as his dream at the beginning of the film, which was worth a few laughs. One problem is that the jokes just do not feel original here, and this film uses the exact same gag from the previous film in which Crystal mouths the words his mother says when she calls on the phone. Neither Crystal or Daniel Stern is very funny here. Jack Palance is pretty good, but not flawless as with the previous movie that won him an Oscar. One downfall to this film is the addition of Jon Lovitz, who cannot act and behave like a child most of the time. There were good scenes, such as Palance discussing his relationship with his brother and such, but ultimately the film becomes cheesy and anticlimactic. There are some fairly off-color scenes as well, one thing that earned this film a PG-13 rating. If you want my advice, stick with the original, a funny film that had good jokes, emotion, and even some lessons, and somehow felt like an original, good comedy. **1/2 out of ****

    A tribute to the acting of an old cow hand: finally, we see a real human being in Jack Palance' character portrayals. The story continues following the death of Jack Palance' tough cowboy, Curly, which was just that and almost no more but more than Jack normally was allowed to play. Fortunately, for we fans, Curly had a twin sailor brother who is now following Billy Crystal's naive and beleaguered Mitch and what unfolds is a fuller view of the man himself. Brilliant. Tragic. A must-have. For those following the story line: gone is Bruno Kirby's angry Ed Furillo, with his third wheel replacement Jon Lovitz entering as Mitch's loser brother, Glen.

    Every so often you get a sequel to a really good movie that is even better than the original; sadly this is not one of them. The gags are more crude than subtle, and stretched till all the stupid people get them, to the point of discomfort, and redoing the VCR gag that was great first time round was a crime against comedy. I loved the first film and after waiting 15 years to catch CS2 I have to say I was disappointed. The start is slow and bogged down by domestic issues that did not contribute to the plot in any meaningful fashion. CS1 was uplifting, CS2 is a predictable repeat and subtracts from your fondness for the characters as they discover greed. Thankfully Jack Palance lived on to make a few more films after this for us to remember him by, may he rest in peace.

    Utter contrivance is the only way to describe this complete rehash of the 1991 smash hit comedy "City Slickers". Again we have three lost, middle aged men searching the wild west for treasure, again accompanied by craggy faced, stony hearted Jack Palance, back from the dead, as it were. Not only is the basic plot structure the same, but all the clever comic moments from the first film are carefully milked again here. Crystal appears to be doing an old routine that looks very tired from early on. Support form comics Daniel Stern and Jon Lovitz (whose character is a waste of space) is uninspired, and it's left to the ever enjoyable Jack Palance to rescue the sinking ship, which he really isn't quite able to do. Writers Billy Crystal, Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel are never able to capture any of the hilarious moments that made the '91 flick so successful, yet they did commit the same error that the original movie's writers Ganz and Mandel did in the first, letting proceedings get clumsily sloppy at the close. Scene after scene is so obviously contrived that it is impossible to let go and enjoy the film. Even one fantastic piece of eye catching cinematography is clearly a set up. What can you do?

    My Take: Not as good as the first, but it's a decent follow-up. The first "City Slickers" was a thoughtful comedy. It focuses on a human story and laughs. It wasn't surprising to find the laughs come full-circle in this sequel. I found this sequel even more hilarious, but let's not say it's better, because there's hardly any difference. This sequel reunites only two stars from the original. Billy Crystal and Daniel Stern, reprising the roles of Mitch and Phil. Mitch is now 40 years-old, and bored with hi life, until he finds a dirty old treasure inside the hat of their dead partner Curly. Of course it's worth millions. of course they'll go out and find it (and than do the "I found the gold!" dance from "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"), some the plot elements are familiar, but the laughs more than make up for it. Jack Palance, doing the role of the brother of his character in the original. And Jon Lovitz portrays the role of Mitch's overreacting brother. So far those elements quite work. Rating: *** out of 5.

    A rare case of the sequel being better than the original. I say this because "City Slickers II", unlike "City Slickers", is presented as a comedy, and is funny, thanks largely to the talents of Jon Lovitz, as Mitch's brother. The first film, in my opinion, tried to be a "serious" film, within the context of being a comedy, as the main characters reflect on their lives as they ride along the trail on their horses.To me, this made the film stilted and pretentious. There was none of this in the sequel.We get pure comedy. I think the film also benefited from the inclusion of Lovitz, and the absence of Bruno Kirby, whose character I found to be annoying in the first film. (I mean no disrespect toward Kirby, who recently passed away) Also, the DVD contains a good commentary by Crystal and Lovitz, whereas the first film has no commentary.

    I don't think that the first one really needed a sequel, but "City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly's Gold" is OK if we just accept it as completely ridiculous. Billy Crystal and Daniel Stern reprise their roles from the original, this time looking for gold said to be buried in the mountains where they had the cattle drive, but Jon Lovitz replaces Bruno Kirby. Jack Palance also returns, not as Curly but as his brother Duke. Needless to say, there's a series of silly situations along the way. I guess that I wouldn't call this movie god-awful - the comments about trying to milk the "cow" were pretty funny - but they really didn't need to make this sequel; the original was just fine. I can see why Billy Crystal didn't have any hits in between "City Slickers" and "Analyze This". Also starring Patricia Wettig, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Bill McKinney (the "squeal like a pig" guy from "Deliverance"), David Paymer, Josh Mostel, and Billy Crystal's two daughters.

    Okay, I may not be the best sequel to a comedy, but at least there were funnier jokes in this one than the original. Don't get me wrong, I really like the first movie and I own it, but watching it again and noticing the jokes in it, pretty much it was all bitching and complaining about their sex lives and their mid life criss-es. And Bruno Kirby is a funny guy, but his character Ed wouldn't stop convincing Mitch to do all these crazy things and asking him ridiculous questions like the woman in the rocket ship and the Kellogs super pack. Pretty much the funniest one (and most unfortunate one) is probably Phil (Daniel Stern). ARLENE: YOU'RE CRAZY! PHIL: THAT'S RIGHT! NOT HAVING SEX FOR 12 YEARS WILL DO THAT TO A PERSON! hilarious, brilliantly hilarious. However, in this movie, the jokes were very well thought, well expressed and sarcastic and frank at the same time. That to me is impressing. GLEN: Hey guys! How do you think those two laughing idiots we rented all this stuff from are going to feel when we bring home all that gold? MITCH: Yeah, the looks on those tobacco chewin', gun rack having, chicken screwin', sister marryin', abandoned bathroom in the front yard leaving, vitamin deficientcied ugly faces! That has to be the best description of two dumbass hicks. There are tons of other jokes in this movie that wish I could recite. I do admit that I was disappointed in a lot of the characters or some recognizable cast were in only in the movie for a very short period of time but thats about it. Anway thats pretty much all I can say about that.

    You can probably tell from the review title that I absolutely loved the first film, the sentimentality occasionally got in the way, but it was funny, beautifully filmed and had adept direction and performances. I admit I was disappointed in this sequel, but there are much worse sequels out there, reading my past reviews you'll probably guess which ones I'm talking about. The film is beautiful to watch with a nice score, and the ending was great. And there were some funny moments, if not anything that I would quote like in the first. Plus the performances are good, Jack Palance makes a brief but worthwhile reprisal here, and Daniel Stern is as goofy and as charming as ever. Billy Crystal is much more reserved here though, and Jon Lovitz did irritate me. The flaws however come in mainly the basic plot structure, I know the first film had a simple story structure but this one had more so and the direction which isn't as skillful or as efficient this time around. Another problem was the pacing, while the film's length itself is fine there are times when the film does drag and badly. As I have said already there were times when I did laugh, but for me it wasn't quite enough. Overall, not an awful sequel, but it was disappointing. 5/10 Bethany Cox

    A lot of the time I avoid sequels to successful comedies, but "City Slickers II" received some fairly good ratings, so I decided to check it out. Unfortunately, I found this film just not funny or emotional enough, and it felt a bit unoriginal. There are some things that had potential, such as Billy Crystal thinking he sees his old friend Curly at several places, as well as his dream at the beginning of the film, which was worth a few laughs. One problem is that the jokes just do not feel original here, and this film uses the exact same gag from the previous film in which Crystal mouths the words his mother says when she calls on the phone. Neither Crystal or Daniel Stern is very funny here. Jack Palance is pretty good, but not flawless as with the previous movie that won him an Oscar. One downfall to this film is the addition of Jon Lovitz, who cannot act and behave like a child most of the time. There were good scenes, such as Palance discussing his relationship with his brother and such, but ultimately the film becomes cheesy and anticlimactic. There are some fairly off-color scenes as well, one thing that earned this film a PG-13 rating. If you want my advice, stick with the original, a funny film that had good jokes, emotion, and even some lessons, and somehow felt like an original, good comedy. **1/2 out of ****

    A tribute to the acting of an old cow hand: finally, we see a real human being in Jack Palance' character portrayals. The story continues following the death of Jack Palance' tough cowboy, Curly, which was just that and almost no more but more than Jack normally was allowed to play. Fortunately, for we fans, Curly had a twin sailor brother who is now following Billy Crystal's naive and beleaguered Mitch and what unfolds is a fuller view of the man himself. Brilliant. Tragic. A must-have. For those following the story line: gone is Bruno Kirby's angry Ed Furillo, with his third wheel replacement Jon Lovitz entering as Mitch's loser brother, Glen.

    Every so often you get a sequel to a really good movie that is even better than the original; sadly this is not one of them. The gags are more crude than subtle, and stretched till all the stupid people get them, to the point of discomfort, and redoing the VCR gag that was great first time round was a crime against comedy. I loved the first film and after waiting 15 years to catch CS2 I have to say I was disappointed. The start is slow and bogged down by domestic issues that did not contribute to the plot in any meaningful fashion. CS1 was uplifting, CS2 is a predictable repeat and subtracts from your fondness for the characters as they discover greed. Thankfully Jack Palance lived on to make a few more films after this for us to remember him by, may he rest in peace.

    Utter contrivance is the only way to describe this complete rehash of the 1991 smash hit comedy "City Slickers". Again we have three lost, middle aged men searching the wild west for treasure, again accompanied by craggy faced, stony hearted Jack Palance, back from the dead, as it were. Not only is the basic plot structure the same, but all the clever comic moments from the first film are carefully milked again here. Crystal appears to be doing an old routine that looks very tired from early on. Support form comics Daniel Stern and Jon Lovitz (whose character is a waste of space) is uninspired, and it's left to the ever enjoyable Jack Palance to rescue the sinking ship, which he really isn't quite able to do. Writers Billy Crystal, Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel are never able to capture any of the hilarious moments that made the '91 flick so successful, yet they did commit the same error that the original movie's writers Ganz and Mandel did in the first, letting proceedings get clumsily sloppy at the close. Scene after scene is so obviously contrived that it is impossible to let go and enjoy the film. Even one fantastic piece of eye catching cinematography is clearly a set up. What can you do?

    My Take: Not as good as the first, but it's a decent follow-up. The first "City Slickers" was a thoughtful comedy. It focuses on a human story and laughs. It wasn't surprising to find the laughs come full-circle in this sequel. I found this sequel even more hilarious, but let's not say it's better, because there's hardly any difference. This sequel reunites only two stars from the original. Billy Crystal and Daniel Stern, reprising the roles of Mitch and Phil. Mitch is now 40 years-old, and bored with hi life, until he finds a dirty old treasure inside the hat of their dead partner Curly. Of course it's worth millions. of course they'll go out and find it (and than do the "I found the gold!" dance from "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"), some the plot elements are familiar, but the laughs more than make up for it. Jack Palance, doing the role of the brother of his character in the original. And Jon Lovitz portrays the role of Mitch's overreacting brother. So far those elements quite work. Rating: *** out of 5.

    A rare case of the sequel being better than the original. I say this because "City Slickers II", unlike "City Slickers", is presented as a comedy, and is funny, thanks largely to the talents of Jon Lovitz, as Mitch's brother. The first film, in my opinion, tried to be a "serious" film, within the context of being a comedy, as the main characters reflect on their lives as they ride along the trail on their horses.To me, this made the film stilted and pretentious. There was none of this in the sequel.We get pure comedy. I think the film also benefited from the inclusion of Lovitz, and the absence of Bruno Kirby, whose character I found to be annoying in the first film. (I mean no disrespect toward Kirby, who recently passed away) Also, the DVD contains a good commentary by Crystal and Lovitz, whereas the first film has no commentary.

    I don't think that the first one really needed a sequel, but "City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly's Gold" is OK if we just accept it as completely ridiculous. Billy Crystal and Daniel Stern reprise their roles from the original, this time looking for gold said to be buried in the mountains where they had the cattle drive, but Jon Lovitz replaces Bruno Kirby. Jack Palance also returns, not as Curly but as his brother Duke. Needless to say, there's a series of silly situations along the way. I guess that I wouldn't call this movie god-awful - the comments about trying to milk the "cow" were pretty funny - but they really didn't need to make this sequel; the original was just fine. I can see why Billy Crystal didn't have any hits in between "City Slickers" and "Analyze This". Also starring Patricia Wettig, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Bill McKinney (the "squeal like a pig" guy from "Deliverance"), David Paymer, Josh Mostel, and Billy Crystal's two daughters.

    Okay, I may not be the best sequel to a comedy, but at least there were funnier jokes in this one than the original. Don't get me wrong, I really like the first movie and I own it, but watching it again and noticing the jokes in it, pretty much it was all bitching and complaining about their sex lives and their mid life criss-es. And Bruno Kirby is a funny guy, but his character Ed wouldn't stop convincing Mitch to do all these crazy things and asking him ridiculous questions like the woman in the rocket ship and the Kellogs super pack. Pretty much the funniest one (and most unfortunate one) is probably Phil (Daniel Stern). ARLENE: YOU'RE CRAZY! PHIL: THAT'S RIGHT! NOT HAVING SEX FOR 12 YEARS WILL DO THAT TO A PERSON! hilarious, brilliantly hilarious. However, in this movie, the jokes were very well thought, well expressed and sarcastic and frank at the same time. That to me is impressing. GLEN: Hey guys! How do you think those two laughing idiots we rented all this stuff from are going to feel when we bring home all that gold? MITCH: Yeah, the looks on those tobacco chewin', gun rack having, chicken screwin', sister marryin', abandoned bathroom in the front yard leaving, vitamin deficientcied ugly faces! That has to be the best description of two dumbass hicks. There are tons of other jokes in this movie that wish I could recite. I do admit that I was disappointed in a lot of the characters or some recognizable cast were in only in the movie for a very short period of time but thats about it. Anway thats pretty much all I can say about that.

    Billy Crystal, Jack Palance, Daniel Stern, Jon Lovitz, Patricia Wettig and Noble Willingham star in this 1994 comedy sequel. This takes place a year after the first film where Mitch is now living in the country near New York and is radio station manager. He starts having bad dreams about late cowboy, Curly (Palance) and thinks he's alive. His friend, Phil (Stern) is now divorced and his brother, Glen (Lovitz) is looking for a handout. While Mitch celebrates his 40th birthday, he finds a treasure map inside Curly's hat. Mitch talks with Phil and they decide to hunt for the treasure that Curly kept secret. Glen joins them and they meet Curly's twin brother, Duke (Palance) who helps them search for the treasure. Wettig returns as Mitch's wife, Barbara and Willingham returns as Clay Stone. I think this is a good sequel with a good cast and recommend it.
