    "Mr. Jones" is an original and creative story, brought to life by a first-rate performance by Richard Gere as a manic depressive. At the outset, in his "up" or manic phase, Gere wants to fly and almost jumps off a building. In his "down" or depressive phase, he feels great sadness. His shrink seems permanently sad and depressed, both in character and as played by the forlorn Lena Olin. Her performance is much more one note. She is very sympathetic toward Gere's Jones, but she didn't draw me in to her character. Most of the time she seemed puzzled, or distant, or sad herself. My rating is mainly due to the original story idea and to Gere. The story does tend to play out and dissipate in the middle third, however.

    Richard Gere offers up a rather penetrating performance of manic-depression and the highs and lows of such a condition. Unlike 28 Days (2000) or Girl Interrupted (1999) there seems to be an imbalance in presentation of the movie itself and its highs and lows in a way that unfortunately distorts the presentation of mental illness. Lena Olin's character as Dr. Bowen, a psychiatrist, M.D. doesn't necessarily offer up sufficient character development to justify the movie's ultimate plot and dynamic interplay with Richard Gere's character as Mr. Jones, unlike perhaps a student intern that would have required much less back story and more consistent with the storyline. The climax of the movie is more of an American romantic drama instead of the more genuine drama that most of the movie itself held onto its integrity. The ending unlike the more Helen (2009) which might be considered stronger in its overall tone and theme, nevertheless is weaker in its depiction of the experiences found with such chemical imbalances.

    Mr. Jones: "Give me this. This first day, I work for free. I give it to you, its a gift. Second day, you pay me for two days. Third day, I have your job." A little gem of a movie. Yes it's subject matter (Bi-polarism and mental illness, and what not) are a tragic and sad theme. But that is why we watch and we learn sometimes from movies. Richard Gere shines as Mr.Jones. he reminds me of the character 'Jesse Lujack' he played in his movie Breathless(1983). Same hyped up energy.He still looks sexy enough for you as the viewer to believe that a woman doctor or woman bank cashier would risk their jobs and sanity for him. Lena Olin is good also as the doctor treating Gere and falls for his crazy charms. Anne Bancroft did an OK turn as Lena's fellow doctor and superior ,Dr. Catherine Holland . Delroy Lindo had a wonderful turn as Howard, the family man who wants to help Jones by giving him friendship. Lauren Tom does a credible job as the ill-fated and mentally unstable patient Amanda Chang. Ana Maria Horsford( from'Friday' fame) has a basically nice cameo as a judge. Thomas Mikal Ford (Tommy from Martin fame) also has a nice bit as a mentally ill patient who can be violent. And last but not least, comic character actor Taylor Negron(Easy Money's Julio)has a nice bit also as a helpless victim of Jones, when said Jones just steals his motorcycle! Actors that got 'wasted' for me were great character actors Sal Lopez(American me) and Bill Moseley(The Devil's Rejects) and Valente Rodriguez(The George Lopez Show) and last but not least,Lucinda Jenny(Rain Man). What I mean by wasted is that their roles were so minimal and inconsequential that I did not see them though they are listed in the credits. What a shame,good talent put to waste. But on a different note and a nice uncredited cameo bit was done by none other than , Bill Pullman as the Construction Site Foreman who is another victim of Jones who falls for his 'charm' and gives a him job(not a good idea). All in all, one of my favorites. Check it out!

    Stinker alert; this flick sucks big time. I am dumbfounded by the number of favorable reviews. This movie was recommended to me by a trusted source, so I watched. I love Anne B., I crave Lena Olin (I've seen all of her major work) and the director has an excellent track record. Lastly, I believe the original screenplay must have been good, as the bones of a solid film appear to be there. To me the derailment is Gere's performance. He is horrible in the same goofy way that he played the lead character in Breathless, another decent film, torpedoed by an over the top, and unbelievably unrealistic interpretation. To say he 'phoned-it-in would be kind. He didn't even tweet-it-in. To be totally honest, I think Lena must also be called out for several scenes where she is too stiff, even though she may have been directed in that manner. Delroy Lindo, superb as always. Lastly, the young Asian patient and her family were much more interesting than the clich&eacute; riddled Mr. Leading Man / Jones. I would have rather seen more development of her character and her relationship with the medical staff. This movie is a total waste. If you value your time do not bother with it, tuning into TV Land for two hours (laden with commercial potty breaks) would be more satisfying.

    With a burst of pop-rock music and Richard Gere peddling happily away on his bicycle down city streets, "Mr. Jones" deceptively begins as an upbeat character study (in fact, "Flashdance...What a Feelin'" would not be out of place here). Too bad then it's just a sunny preamble to the meat and potatoes of the story: a bipolar depressive acts recklessly until he is finally institutionalized. There's a lady psychiatrist who is drawn to him (she's emotionally vulnerable due to a recent break-up), a sassy bank teller who is introduced for no other purpose than to give Richard a pretty date, a trip to a piano store where Gere tickles the ivories...but what is "Mr. Jones" about, at its core? Not even director Mike Figgis appears to know, following manic Gere randomly around town and then to a friend's house for dinner (where all the polite, happy children bow their heads in thankfulness). This is not an exercise in catharsis; Figgis wants to earn points with us through little acts of humility and false emotion--not hard-hitting realism. He doesn't have anything to gain with this picture, not even dramatically once Gere hits the wall and realizes he needs medical help. No one speaks of the financial obligations the central character is under by getting so much hands-on treatment and medication, while father-of-seven Delroy Lindo thinks nothing of slipping Gere some friendly cash (with all those hungry kids at home, one might think Gere should at least refuse the money on principle and not out of pride). Gere (also one of the producers) is up to the challenge of portraying a manic-depressive with euphoric highs and suicidal lows, but the movie tips its hand early on that wild, spontaneous behavior is healthy for the soul. It helps get you jobs, it helps make you friends! It's the same thinking which made "A Thousand Clowns" into an unbearable hit. ** from ****

    I was watching this on video rather than in a theater, which was a real blessing, as I was able to liberate myself from watching all of the 110 minutes of this excruciatingly BORING and DISTURBING movie. I knew I probably wasn't going to like it within the first 5 minutes or so, but I was going to give it a chance. I resisted the urge to simply turn it off after about 15 minutes during which absolutely nothing happened, but I forced myself give it another 15 minutes. That was real torture and after that I was done. If you liked The Brave New World, you might like this. If you ever fantasized about what it could feel like to have a mental disorder, this is probably custom made for you. But if you like romantic comedies and uplifting movies that make you feel good, like I do, this isn't the movie for you. My recommendation is to avoid watching this awful stuff in the first place.

    Based on the first few minutes, I was expecting a comedy about a happy-go-lucky construction worker who displays unconventional behavior. Even after his first trip to a mental hospital, I figured this would be a romantic comedy about a fun guy and the pretty female psychiatrist who wants to prove he's wacko. Actually, she is right about him. He is manic-depressive. The man who only refers to himself as "Mr. Jones" doesn't believe he is manic-depressive because he would have to get depressed. We haven't seen it and surely it's not true, right? Wrong. This is a very troubled man. He will need a lot of care, and we must be prepared to go through some hard times with him. Richard Gere did a very good job. Naturally, I liked him best when he was fun. His character seems "normal" because this is a movie, but that soon changes. Gere effectively shows a wide range of personality styles, though this is nothing groundbreaking. Delroy Lindo is a standout performer as Howard, the co-worker who apparently saves Mr. Jones' life. Although they work together less than a full day (I assume), they become close friends. Some of my favorite scenes have Gere and Lindo together. Baha Jackson does a good job as Howard's son. Lauren Tom briefly appears as a bubbly, fast-talking, excited patient. Too bubbly. She's going to have to crash--and she does. Whether you like this movie or not depends on whether you want comedy or drama. I found enough scenes enjoyable.

    Honestly, this is the best movie of all time that Richard Grere stars in. Not because I dislike his acting or his movies - but purely because he was spot-on perfect. I cant imagine a single other actor who could have portrayed a Bi-polar person perfectly. and he did - I have Bi-polar and I know from experience how hard it can be, especially because it is truly like being on drugs, like he said- "I need the highs" It was also amazing that they added in the anger along with the depression - not all manic stages are crazy, euphoric highs, sometimes they are also combined with irrational anger, which was definitely portrayed well in Mr. Jones' ping-pong match, and in the end, when he goes to visit his old construction friend. Yes, the romance was very unrealistic, but it added a chance for a happy ending - Mr. Jones isn't by any means 'cured' but there is someone who understands him and his disorder, someone who is willing to help him in his highs and lows and knows how dangerous he can be. I definitely give this movie a 10, I love it.

    I find it interesting that films are so often chastised for being "unrealistic," when realism is usually neither an attainable nor desirable goal in a film (for example, most films don't portray a story that unfolds within two hours or less, so montages or other devices are used). The main purpose of Mr. Jones (the film) is to tell the story of a man with bipolar disorder, and issues of "realism," for me, are then based on two questions. Firstly, did the film, and Richard Gere in particular, accurately portray the experiences of a person with bipolar disorder? Secondly, was his experience with mental heath care also fairly portrayed? As someone who has suffered from bipolar disorder for almost ten years, I can unequivocally say that the answer to both questions is yes. This film gives the best portrayal I have yet to see of the experiences of suffering from and being treated for bipolar disorder. From the early scene where Mr. Jones is seen trying desperately to get a job, to the ending sequence where he tries to fly for the nth time over and gives up, Gere gives an outstanding and thoroughly believable performance of a man living with the intensity of bipolar disorder. Most poignant to me were the moments when he was able to realize just how much he was fooling himself about the disease, yet couldn't break away from it. In a lesser movie, the line "I'm an addict" would be a sarcastic reference to his medication; here, it is used as a perfect description of Jones' need for his manic highs. In addition, I have yet to see as understanding a cinematic portrayal of mental health care in the United States. Even upon viewing it fifteen years later, this film deals so accurately with so many mental health care issues - the "revolving door" aspect of treating patients in current-day America, the moments of joy and pain one can experience even within a hospital (without the overdone dramatics of most films taking place in mental hospitals), and the efforts and sacrifices that doctors and staff make every day. Indeed, one of the most striking aspects of the film has to be the ease with which Gere walks in and out of treatment, a truly realistic situation, even more realistic because he has apparently been doing so for many years. The reality, despite what films would normally have us believe, is that it is much more likely in America today to be trapped in a "revolving door" for many years, never getting the treatment one really needs, than to be "wrongfully institutionalized" for many years. Unfortunately for "realism," the latter makes for much better high drama. Speaking of high drama, let me turn to two slightly controversial aspects of the film: the love story aspect, and the ending. Personally, I don't find it "unrealistic" that Jones' doctor could fall in love with him - it certainly happens in real-life patient-doctor relationships, and it makes for an interesting twist. Others have criticized this part of the story as unnecessary, but I see no particular reason for its omission, because the film did give plenty of screen time to the story of Jones' disease and there was room for this extra plot angle. In addition, her responses to the developing relationship and her resignation were handled excellently and accurately - there was no deux ex machina that allowed her to stay at the hospital or keep treating him - and also allowed for a look at some of the ethical issues involved in mental heath care. My only issue with the love story was that it was a bit clich&eacute;d, but it didn't detract from the film much at all in my opinion. As for the ending, a lot of people have had trouble with the fact that Jones either seems to be "cured" too easily, or that there was no climax where he actually fell off the house, or that in general it was too "neatly wrapped up." I would have to say that, knowing the bipolar disorder condition so personally, the ending was perfect. For sufferers of bipolar disorder, it can be so easy and quick to move from one mood to another, and the arrival of a loved one can easily "snap you out" of dangerous situations. The message that I took from the ending was not that he was "cured," or that he wasn't (there is no "cure" for bipolar disorder at this point). It was simply that he had faced another tough day as a sufferer of a disease, and that he now had a lover who was going to help him face more tough days. The end dialogue is particularly telling. His last line: "So now what?" Hers: "A cup of coffee. Decaf." They are moving on. Our view into their lives is over, but they will be fighting the battle for years to come. The rest of the movie has already told us that. A lesser script would have had some sort of "and then life became great" montage, which would have ruined this film. Here we are left with the understanding that the fight against the disease goes on, but that he now has someone who will aid in the fight and temper his moods as best she can, starting with sticking to decaf (which is more than just a joke if you have bipolar disorder). If you don't mind a fairly standard Hollywood love story as part of the mix, you will find this an outstanding, moving, and educational film. I give it 9 out of 10 only because the love story goes on just a tad too long, and that time could have been used for more exploration of the illness and its treatment.

    The most poignant point in this movie, for me, was not whether doctors should have relationships with patients (of course we know this happens, we know it is wrong, we know it doesn't usually happen, and we should all be horrified at the thought), it was not that people who have bipolar are people, too, and it was not how well Gere portrayed his character. It was the fact that his character was unwilling to take his meds because his euphoric highs were what made his depressive lows tolerable, and even worth it. And those euphoric highs were amazing, a huge bite into life that many of us only wish we were brazen enough to chew. But, of course, his illness prevents the wise knowledge of how high to go. Imagine this yo-yo approach to life - for a lifetime - I can't. Next, imagine someone suffering the lows to the same degree Gere's character suffered the highs. Suicide, anyone? This movie slams home the emotional roller coaster which courts of law and some medical establishments are incapable of approaching correctly. I wonder if locking Mr. Jones up for grand theft would have been a good thing - nah, not really, c'mon think about it. As for the unprofessional behavior of the doctor - well, I guess she fell in love. Shame on her. Of course, she should have withdrawn from his case. I wonder who would have been in charge of his treatment, and what treatment he would have received. D'oh, this was her major concern, for this particular storyline. The doctor who would have taken over was quite undesirable. Although most medical facilities are professionally compassionate regarding the illness, this movie used a plot with an antagonist - necessary for a climactic story, but seldom available in real life. It's just to remind us that sometimes exceptions can be allowed and punishments waived for human errors. I never got the impression that this movie was encouraging unprofessional behavior.

    Based on the first few minutes, I was expecting a comedy about a happy-go-lucky construction worker who displays unconventional behavior. Even after his first trip to a mental hospital, I figured this would be a romantic comedy about a fun guy and the pretty female psychiatrist who wants to prove he's wacko. Actually, she is right about him. He is manic-depressive. The man who only refers to himself as "Mr. Jones" doesn't believe he is manic-depressive because he would have to get depressed. We haven't seen it and surely it's not true, right? Wrong. This is a very troubled man. He will need a lot of care, and we must be prepared to go through some hard times with him. Richard Gere did a very good job. Naturally, I liked him best when he was fun. His character seems "normal" because this is a movie, but that soon changes. Gere effectively shows a wide range of personality styles, though this is nothing groundbreaking. Delroy Lindo is a standout performer as Howard, the co-worker who apparently saves Mr. Jones' life. Although they work together less than a full day (I assume), they become close friends. Some of my favorite scenes have Gere and Lindo together. Baha Jackson does a good job as Howard's son. Lauren Tom briefly appears as a bubbly, fast-talking, excited patient. Too bubbly. She's going to have to crash--and she does. Whether you like this movie or not depends on whether you want comedy or drama. I found enough scenes enjoyable.

    Honestly, this is the best movie of all time that Richard Grere stars in. Not because I dislike his acting or his movies - but purely because he was spot-on perfect. I cant imagine a single other actor who could have portrayed a Bi-polar person perfectly. and he did - I have Bi-polar and I know from experience how hard it can be, especially because it is truly like being on drugs, like he said- "I need the highs" It was also amazing that they added in the anger along with the depression - not all manic stages are crazy, euphoric highs, sometimes they are also combined with irrational anger, which was definitely portrayed well in Mr. Jones' ping-pong match, and in the end, when he goes to visit his old construction friend. Yes, the romance was very unrealistic, but it added a chance for a happy ending - Mr. Jones isn't by any means 'cured' but there is someone who understands him and his disorder, someone who is willing to help him in his highs and lows and knows how dangerous he can be. I definitely give this movie a 10, I love it.

    I find it interesting that films are so often chastised for being "unrealistic," when realism is usually neither an attainable nor desirable goal in a film (for example, most films don't portray a story that unfolds within two hours or less, so montages or other devices are used). The main purpose of Mr. Jones (the film) is to tell the story of a man with bipolar disorder, and issues of "realism," for me, are then based on two questions. Firstly, did the film, and Richard Gere in particular, accurately portray the experiences of a person with bipolar disorder? Secondly, was his experience with mental heath care also fairly portrayed? As someone who has suffered from bipolar disorder for almost ten years, I can unequivocally say that the answer to both questions is yes. This film gives the best portrayal I have yet to see of the experiences of suffering from and being treated for bipolar disorder. From the early scene where Mr. Jones is seen trying desperately to get a job, to the ending sequence where he tries to fly for the nth time over and gives up, Gere gives an outstanding and thoroughly believable performance of a man living with the intensity of bipolar disorder. Most poignant to me were the moments when he was able to realize just how much he was fooling himself about the disease, yet couldn't break away from it. In a lesser movie, the line "I'm an addict" would be a sarcastic reference to his medication; here, it is used as a perfect description of Jones' need for his manic highs. In addition, I have yet to see as understanding a cinematic portrayal of mental health care in the United States. Even upon viewing it fifteen years later, this film deals so accurately with so many mental health care issues - the "revolving door" aspect of treating patients in current-day America, the moments of joy and pain one can experience even within a hospital (without the overdone dramatics of most films taking place in mental hospitals), and the efforts and sacrifices that doctors and staff make every day. Indeed, one of the most striking aspects of the film has to be the ease with which Gere walks in and out of treatment, a truly realistic situation, even more realistic because he has apparently been doing so for many years. The reality, despite what films would normally have us believe, is that it is much more likely in America today to be trapped in a "revolving door" for many years, never getting the treatment one really needs, than to be "wrongfully institutionalized" for many years. Unfortunately for "realism," the latter makes for much better high drama. Speaking of high drama, let me turn to two slightly controversial aspects of the film: the love story aspect, and the ending. Personally, I don't find it "unrealistic" that Jones' doctor could fall in love with him - it certainly happens in real-life patient-doctor relationships, and it makes for an interesting twist. Others have criticized this part of the story as unnecessary, but I see no particular reason for its omission, because the film did give plenty of screen time to the story of Jones' disease and there was room for this extra plot angle. In addition, her responses to the developing relationship and her resignation were handled excellently and accurately - there was no deux ex machina that allowed her to stay at the hospital or keep treating him - and also allowed for a look at some of the ethical issues involved in mental heath care. My only issue with the love story was that it was a bit clich&eacute;d, but it didn't detract from the film much at all in my opinion. As for the ending, a lot of people have had trouble with the fact that Jones either seems to be "cured" too easily, or that there was no climax where he actually fell off the house, or that in general it was too "neatly wrapped up." I would have to say that, knowing the bipolar disorder condition so personally, the ending was perfect. For sufferers of bipolar disorder, it can be so easy and quick to move from one mood to another, and the arrival of a loved one can easily "snap you out" of dangerous situations. The message that I took from the ending was not that he was "cured," or that he wasn't (there is no "cure" for bipolar disorder at this point). It was simply that he had faced another tough day as a sufferer of a disease, and that he now had a lover who was going to help him face more tough days. The end dialogue is particularly telling. His last line: "So now what?" Hers: "A cup of coffee. Decaf." They are moving on. Our view into their lives is over, but they will be fighting the battle for years to come. The rest of the movie has already told us that. A lesser script would have had some sort of "and then life became great" montage, which would have ruined this film. Here we are left with the understanding that the fight against the disease goes on, but that he now has someone who will aid in the fight and temper his moods as best she can, starting with sticking to decaf (which is more than just a joke if you have bipolar disorder). If you don't mind a fairly standard Hollywood love story as part of the mix, you will find this an outstanding, moving, and educational film. I give it 9 out of 10 only because the love story goes on just a tad too long, and that time could have been used for more exploration of the illness and its treatment.

    The most poignant point in this movie, for me, was not whether doctors should have relationships with patients (of course we know this happens, we know it is wrong, we know it doesn't usually happen, and we should all be horrified at the thought), it was not that people who have bipolar are people, too, and it was not how well Gere portrayed his character. It was the fact that his character was unwilling to take his meds because his euphoric highs were what made his depressive lows tolerable, and even worth it. And those euphoric highs were amazing, a huge bite into life that many of us only wish we were brazen enough to chew. But, of course, his illness prevents the wise knowledge of how high to go. Imagine this yo-yo approach to life - for a lifetime - I can't. Next, imagine someone suffering the lows to the same degree Gere's character suffered the highs. Suicide, anyone? This movie slams home the emotional roller coaster which courts of law and some medical establishments are incapable of approaching correctly. I wonder if locking Mr. Jones up for grand theft would have been a good thing - nah, not really, c'mon think about it. As for the unprofessional behavior of the doctor - well, I guess she fell in love. Shame on her. Of course, she should have withdrawn from his case. I wonder who would have been in charge of his treatment, and what treatment he would have received. D'oh, this was her major concern, for this particular storyline. The doctor who would have taken over was quite undesirable. Although most medical facilities are professionally compassionate regarding the illness, this movie used a plot with an antagonist - necessary for a climactic story, but seldom available in real life. It's just to remind us that sometimes exceptions can be allowed and punishments waived for human errors. I never got the impression that this movie was encouraging unprofessional behavior.

    "Mr. Jones" is an original and creative story, brought to life by a first-rate performance by Richard Gere as a manic depressive. At the outset, in his "up" or manic phase, Gere wants to fly and almost jumps off a building. In his "down" or depressive phase, he feels great sadness. His shrink seems permanently sad and depressed, both in character and as played by the forlorn Lena Olin. Her performance is much more one note. She is very sympathetic toward Gere's Jones, but she didn't draw me in to her character. Most of the time she seemed puzzled, or distant, or sad herself. My rating is mainly due to the original story idea and to Gere. The story does tend to play out and dissipate in the middle third, however.

    Richard Gere offers up a rather penetrating performance of manic-depression and the highs and lows of such a condition. Unlike 28 Days (2000) or Girl Interrupted (1999) there seems to be an imbalance in presentation of the movie itself and its highs and lows in a way that unfortunately distorts the presentation of mental illness. Lena Olin's character as Dr. Bowen, a psychiatrist, M.D. doesn't necessarily offer up sufficient character development to justify the movie's ultimate plot and dynamic interplay with Richard Gere's character as Mr. Jones, unlike perhaps a student intern that would have required much less back story and more consistent with the storyline. The climax of the movie is more of an American romantic drama instead of the more genuine drama that most of the movie itself held onto its integrity. The ending unlike the more Helen (2009) which might be considered stronger in its overall tone and theme, nevertheless is weaker in its depiction of the experiences found with such chemical imbalances.

    Mr. Jones: "Give me this. This first day, I work for free. I give it to you, its a gift. Second day, you pay me for two days. Third day, I have your job." A little gem of a movie. Yes it's subject matter (Bi-polarism and mental illness, and what not) are a tragic and sad theme. But that is why we watch and we learn sometimes from movies. Richard Gere shines as Mr.Jones. he reminds me of the character 'Jesse Lujack' he played in his movie Breathless(1983). Same hyped up energy.He still looks sexy enough for you as the viewer to believe that a woman doctor or woman bank cashier would risk their jobs and sanity for him. Lena Olin is good also as the doctor treating Gere and falls for his crazy charms. Anne Bancroft did an OK turn as Lena's fellow doctor and superior ,Dr. Catherine Holland . Delroy Lindo had a wonderful turn as Howard, the family man who wants to help Jones by giving him friendship. Lauren Tom does a credible job as the ill-fated and mentally unstable patient Amanda Chang. Ana Maria Horsford( from'Friday' fame) has a basically nice cameo as a judge. Thomas Mikal Ford (Tommy from Martin fame) also has a nice bit as a mentally ill patient who can be violent. And last but not least, comic character actor Taylor Negron(Easy Money's Julio)has a nice bit also as a helpless victim of Jones, when said Jones just steals his motorcycle! Actors that got 'wasted' for me were great character actors Sal Lopez(American me) and Bill Moseley(The Devil's Rejects) and Valente Rodriguez(The George Lopez Show) and last but not least,Lucinda Jenny(Rain Man). What I mean by wasted is that their roles were so minimal and inconsequential that I did not see them though they are listed in the credits. What a shame,good talent put to waste. But on a different note and a nice uncredited cameo bit was done by none other than , Bill Pullman as the Construction Site Foreman who is another victim of Jones who falls for his 'charm' and gives a him job(not a good idea). All in all, one of my favorites. Check it out!

    Stinker alert; this flick sucks big time. I am dumbfounded by the number of favorable reviews. This movie was recommended to me by a trusted source, so I watched. I love Anne B., I crave Lena Olin (I've seen all of her major work) and the director has an excellent track record. Lastly, I believe the original screenplay must have been good, as the bones of a solid film appear to be there. To me the derailment is Gere's performance. He is horrible in the same goofy way that he played the lead character in Breathless, another decent film, torpedoed by an over the top, and unbelievably unrealistic interpretation. To say he 'phoned-it-in would be kind. He didn't even tweet-it-in. To be totally honest, I think Lena must also be called out for several scenes where she is too stiff, even though she may have been directed in that manner. Delroy Lindo, superb as always. Lastly, the young Asian patient and her family were much more interesting than the clich&eacute; riddled Mr. Leading Man / Jones. I would have rather seen more development of her character and her relationship with the medical staff. This movie is a total waste. If you value your time do not bother with it, tuning into TV Land for two hours (laden with commercial potty breaks) would be more satisfying.

    With a burst of pop-rock music and Richard Gere peddling happily away on his bicycle down city streets, "Mr. Jones" deceptively begins as an upbeat character study (in fact, "Flashdance...What a Feelin'" would not be out of place here). Too bad then it's just a sunny preamble to the meat and potatoes of the story: a bipolar depressive acts recklessly until he is finally institutionalized. There's a lady psychiatrist who is drawn to him (she's emotionally vulnerable due to a recent break-up), a sassy bank teller who is introduced for no other purpose than to give Richard a pretty date, a trip to a piano store where Gere tickles the ivories...but what is "Mr. Jones" about, at its core? Not even director Mike Figgis appears to know, following manic Gere randomly around town and then to a friend's house for dinner (where all the polite, happy children bow their heads in thankfulness). This is not an exercise in catharsis; Figgis wants to earn points with us through little acts of humility and false emotion--not hard-hitting realism. He doesn't have anything to gain with this picture, not even dramatically once Gere hits the wall and realizes he needs medical help. No one speaks of the financial obligations the central character is under by getting so much hands-on treatment and medication, while father-of-seven Delroy Lindo thinks nothing of slipping Gere some friendly cash (with all those hungry kids at home, one might think Gere should at least refuse the money on principle and not out of pride). Gere (also one of the producers) is up to the challenge of portraying a manic-depressive with euphoric highs and suicidal lows, but the movie tips its hand early on that wild, spontaneous behavior is healthy for the soul. It helps get you jobs, it helps make you friends! It's the same thinking which made "A Thousand Clowns" into an unbearable hit. ** from ****

    I was watching this on video rather than in a theater, which was a real blessing, as I was able to liberate myself from watching all of the 110 minutes of this excruciatingly BORING and DISTURBING movie. I knew I probably wasn't going to like it within the first 5 minutes or so, but I was going to give it a chance. I resisted the urge to simply turn it off after about 15 minutes during which absolutely nothing happened, but I forced myself give it another 15 minutes. That was real torture and after that I was done. If you liked The Brave New World, you might like this. If you ever fantasized about what it could feel like to have a mental disorder, this is probably custom made for you. But if you like romantic comedies and uplifting movies that make you feel good, like I do, this isn't the movie for you. My recommendation is to avoid watching this awful stuff in the first place.
