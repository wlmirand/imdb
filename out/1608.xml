 <sinopse>
  An eccentric socialite raises a gorilla as her son.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  This is a fact based story about a socialite and her husband who live in a mansion with a brood of animals including chimpanzees who are raised as her children. When she discovers an ailing baby gorilla, she decides to care for it as well. Years later, the gorilla is fully grown and its strength is sometimes out of control. However, the gorilla shows love for his mistress and obeys her commands. That all changes when she is invited to display the gorilla and chimps at the Chicago World's Fair. Accidentally freed by one of the chimps, the gorilla terrorizes the Fair. From that point on, he becomes moody and more uncontrollable until he attacks his mistress in a bestial rage.

    My 5 year old picked this movie as our Friday night family movie. It seemed fun and cute! Boy was I wrong! The only thing funny and cute about this movie is the Chimps. About 5 minutes in you think this lady is Deranged!!!! And then there is a whole lip stick scene that just seems uncomfortable! I was afraid I was going to have to make a fast jump on the remote! And then when you finally think she may have gotten her stuff together you make the mistake of looking up the true story of this lady and realize she is the complete opposite of an activist for animals!!!! Don't watch this movie!!!

    Get your movie off me you damned dirty ape! Sorry to see the chimps exploited in the movie and I wonder where those chimps are now. That being said, the movie was sappy and disappointing. The costuming was great but the movie over all just feels meandering and pointless. There is almost a point where Russo's character realizes that she's abused this animal by having it live like a human but then she misses the realization in favor of the belief that she's somehow still in control of Buddy the gorilla. Would have made a decent Fatal Attractions episode but not a good full length feature film. Go see Chimpanzee instead.

    I got the DVD of this movie in a cereal box years ago when I was a little kid. I have loved this movie ever since and have watched it time and time again. This movie was amazing especially for animal lovers. I believe it's very under appreciated. It was sweet and brought tears to my eyes. But you probably do have to be an animal lover to fully like this movie. I wish this movie would go into theaters although it has already been out on DVD for awhile. I wish more attention was brought to this movie because I think it could've done decently well. I wish to show this to my children one day. It's a good movie for kids although maybe a few of the scenes could be a tad frightening. Buddy is a lovable character and this is a great movie.

    The most god awful movie I've seen, period. The only thing in memory more tedious was a 12 hour layover in LAX. Being the only movie I have ever walked out on in theaters, I can confidently say that I would rather have all of my teeth pulled out of my head with rusty pliers than ever sit through this film again. Buddy is a tedious, lifeless movie about a pathetic woman who hangs out with a fake gorilla for an hour and a half. And as shameful as it is to say, this is one of those rare instances where a talking animal would actually vastly improve the film. Jim Henson must have been rolling in his grave.

    Oh my god, this film felt like 40 minutes long and i found it deeply emotional T-T, i know Rene Russo isn't the only actress that cares about some silly 300lb ape but COME ON!!! this film is REALLY childish and it's emotional scenes deferred very very badly against many films released in 1997, including Hercules & Titanic. OK, might right a spoiler here; Buddy starts of as some 6inch Gorilla cub, He gains weight once a year, after a massacre in a World Fair he becomes hotheaded and nearly tries to kill Rene Russo after a kitchen accident, Later, Buddy was so angry he destroyed most of the mansion and has been sent to a zoo ever since. The true story is the Oldest Known Gorilla died at the age of 54, so yeah, it's that non-fictional kids...

    Does anyone remember the name of a movie made around this same time which starred the sign language gorilla and young teenage boy who kidnaps him from the lab his mother is working at and the adventure ensues? Thank you for your help!!!! I would like to try and find this movie on DVD if it exists. It was kind-of a cute comedy-family movie as I remember and the teenage boy drives him I think to Canada after dressing him up in a trench coat and hat and stealing him in a van and then taking him to a min-mart type place for food. Does this sound familiar to anyone? I could really use your help as the name escapes me now. I do remember renting it on VHS though around 1994-1997. Somewhere around that time frame. I think it was better than Buddy as a movie.

    My Take: More proof that decent special effects and pretty sets can't tell the story. BUDDY is the film that BABE could have easily been, but while that harmless, little achievement took to a different direction (and succeeded as a great, little film), BUDDY takes off on the wrong track. The story elements are easily predictable, but that's rarely the worst part since the film, despite some imagination and style which went into the production design, the story drags on. It's dully paced and slow-moving, it's pretty hard to care for a somewhat interesting character (a domesticated ape, no less). Rene Russo plays, and is actually fine as, eccentric wealthy animal lover Gertrude Lintz, who adopts all sorts of animals, chimpanzees mostly, and grooms them into civilized beings, dressing them up and teaches them to walk upright and eat on a table (with a spoon and fork, no less). Alongside her and her menagerie of trained (and well-dressed) apes is her husband (Robbie Coltrane), a helpful maid (Irma P. Hall) and her assistant (Alan Cumming). But when she decides to adopt a harmless orphaned gorilla, her confidence is slowly loosing as Buddy, as groomed and as attentive an animal he is, he's still an animal. Russo and co., thankfully given some decent roles, are actually good, and the ape (cheesy as ape suits are today) is pretty endearing. But unlike BABE, the focus pitched on the animals are pretty tedious. This time, I think, giving the animals the gift of speech is a welcome asset. Director Caroline Thompson seemed to be distracted by the overall look of the film (the production design, from costumes to sets, are spontaneously elaborate) to strongly develop the script. The story lags a long in a drowsy, monotonous pace that could even put a few children to sleep. What could have been an eagerly acceptable fantasy with touches of engaging tragedy is an elaborate and fancy bore. BUDDY isn't a failure, but it fails more than it succeeds. At best, it's a promise that never really got off the ground. Rating: **1/2 out of 5.

    As a big fan of gorilla movies in general, I anticipated that this one would be great - and as for the gorilla effects, They were quite good, however - that is the only thing I can write about this flop. The film claims to be based on a true story but in effect, it does not even come close to what actually happened to "Buddy" - who in real life, was the famous Gargantua, sold to Ringling Bros. by our supposed "heroic" Gertrude Lintz, known by many animal enthusiasts as a woman who hardly had her animals' welfare in the best interest. As far as Buddy being portrayed as becoming aggressive, this was total fiction and at no time did the gorilla, in real life, resort to such behavior. buddy did, in fact, escape his wooden crate (not a plush cage room as depicted in movie) during a storm, to seek shelter and comfort in the house, which frightened Gertrude Lintz into selling him. No, Buddy was not released into a gorilla family surrounded by lush trees in a zoological paradise - he was abandoned in a wooden crate, deep in the back of a garage for some time with only a single light bulb for comfort and then sold to the circus - where he actually lived a better life having peanuts thrown at him until he died (historically the oldest living gorilla on record, by the way) before a show in Miami. Notice also, in the film, how Buddy grows older but the chimpanzees never age. (The chimps, by the way, were not raised simultaneously with other animals, including Buddy, as portrayed in the film)

    Curiously, it is Rene Russo's eyes and mouth--not Buddy the Gorilla's-- that emerge as the focal point of "Buddy", a Jim Henson Pictures production through Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope. Somehow, countless close-ups of Russo's face slipped passed in the post-production stages, and she literally fills the screen so many times the poor apes are upstaged. Unintentionally funny true story adapted from Gertrude "Trudy" Davies Lint's memoirs about a wealthy doctor's wife who turns their mansion into a menagerie for pets and wild-life. The movie goes beyond good intentions...it positively drips with earnest sincerity. The movie never sparkles with the kind of "family film" magic that it needed, and before too long both the people and the animals seem distinctly programmed (nothing here feels real). About ten minutes in, two chimpanzees are goofing around in Russo's kitchen and start throwing a butcher's knife back and forth (it misses Alan Cumming's head by inches); yet, no eyebrows are raised because it's all in a day's fun. Still, when full-grown gorilla Buddy gets crazy during a thunderstorm, the cops are called--and everyone stares at Buddy through the window while he busts up the living room furniture. The furniture should be the least of anyone's worries in this flabbergasting, do-gooder failure. But, at least we know Russo was in good hands: whenever director Caroline Thompson needs a good pick-up shot, she gives unstartled Rene another extreme close-up. I wonder what the lipstick budget was on this picture? ** from ****

    Trudy Lintz (Rene Russo) was one very fortunate lady many years ago. She was the wife of a wealthy doctor and had lots of extracurricular money. Her passion was animals and she devoted herself to providing a sanctuary for the furry ones on her property grounds. Trudy also raised two chimps in her home to be more like children. They dressed in clothes and had many amenities. One day, she learns of an abandoned baby gorilla. Knowing nothing about the large apes, she relies on her husband's medical abilities and expert advice to save the gorilla's life. Once out of danger, Trudy decides she will raise the gorilla, also, as one of her children. This works well for years and Buddy, the gorilla, is truly a remarkably intelligent addition to her home. But, Buddy is also a gorilla and his strength and curiosity become quite enormous. Will Trudy be able to keep Buddy under control? For those who love animals, Buddy is a must-see movie. Based on a true story, Trudy and her ape develop a relationship that is unique in the annals of animal history and lore. Of course, Buddy is not a real gorilla but a mechanical one, in the film, but he is very close to seeming totally real. Russo gives a nice performance as a lady ahead of her time and the supporting players are also quite nice. The costumes are exemplary, as befitting the earlier era of the story, and the settings and production values outstanding. But, most importantly, animals are here in abundance, not only Buddy, but the adorable chimps, the ducks, the rabbits, and so forth. For those who want to watch a film and be transported to animal heaven, here on earth, this is a great movie choice. All animal lovers, and even those who just want to watch a great family film, will go "ape" over Buddy.

    Get your movie off me you damned dirty ape! Sorry to see the chimps exploited in the movie and I wonder where those chimps are now. That being said, the movie was sappy and disappointing. The costuming was great but the movie over all just feels meandering and pointless. There is almost a point where Russo's character realizes that she's abused this animal by having it live like a human but then she misses the realization in favor of the belief that she's somehow still in control of Buddy the gorilla. Would have made a decent Fatal Attractions episode but not a good full length feature film. Go see Chimpanzee instead.

    I got the DVD of this movie in a cereal box years ago when I was a little kid. I have loved this movie ever since and have watched it time and time again. This movie was amazing especially for animal lovers. I believe it's very under appreciated. It was sweet and brought tears to my eyes. But you probably do have to be an animal lover to fully like this movie. I wish this movie would go into theaters although it has already been out on DVD for awhile. I wish more attention was brought to this movie because I think it could've done decently well. I wish to show this to my children one day. It's a good movie for kids although maybe a few of the scenes could be a tad frightening. Buddy is a lovable character and this is a great movie.

    The most god awful movie I've seen, period. The only thing in memory more tedious was a 12 hour layover in LAX. Being the only movie I have ever walked out on in theaters, I can confidently say that I would rather have all of my teeth pulled out of my head with rusty pliers than ever sit through this film again. Buddy is a tedious, lifeless movie about a pathetic woman who hangs out with a fake gorilla for an hour and a half. And as shameful as it is to say, this is one of those rare instances where a talking animal would actually vastly improve the film. Jim Henson must have been rolling in his grave.

    Oh my god, this film felt like 40 minutes long and i found it deeply emotional T-T, i know Rene Russo isn't the only actress that cares about some silly 300lb ape but COME ON!!! this film is REALLY childish and it's emotional scenes deferred very very badly against many films released in 1997, including Hercules & Titanic. OK, might right a spoiler here; Buddy starts of as some 6inch Gorilla cub, He gains weight once a year, after a massacre in a World Fair he becomes hotheaded and nearly tries to kill Rene Russo after a kitchen accident, Later, Buddy was so angry he destroyed most of the mansion and has been sent to a zoo ever since. The true story is the Oldest Known Gorilla died at the age of 54, so yeah, it's that non-fictional kids...

    Does anyone remember the name of a movie made around this same time which starred the sign language gorilla and young teenage boy who kidnaps him from the lab his mother is working at and the adventure ensues? Thank you for your help!!!! I would like to try and find this movie on DVD if it exists. It was kind-of a cute comedy-family movie as I remember and the teenage boy drives him I think to Canada after dressing him up in a trench coat and hat and stealing him in a van and then taking him to a min-mart type place for food. Does this sound familiar to anyone? I could really use your help as the name escapes me now. I do remember renting it on VHS though around 1994-1997. Somewhere around that time frame. I think it was better than Buddy as a movie.

    My Take: More proof that decent special effects and pretty sets can't tell the story. BUDDY is the film that BABE could have easily been, but while that harmless, little achievement took to a different direction (and succeeded as a great, little film), BUDDY takes off on the wrong track. The story elements are easily predictable, but that's rarely the worst part since the film, despite some imagination and style which went into the production design, the story drags on. It's dully paced and slow-moving, it's pretty hard to care for a somewhat interesting character (a domesticated ape, no less). Rene Russo plays, and is actually fine as, eccentric wealthy animal lover Gertrude Lintz, who adopts all sorts of animals, chimpanzees mostly, and grooms them into civilized beings, dressing them up and teaches them to walk upright and eat on a table (with a spoon and fork, no less). Alongside her and her menagerie of trained (and well-dressed) apes is her husband (Robbie Coltrane), a helpful maid (Irma P. Hall) and her assistant (Alan Cumming). But when she decides to adopt a harmless orphaned gorilla, her confidence is slowly loosing as Buddy, as groomed and as attentive an animal he is, he's still an animal. Russo and co., thankfully given some decent roles, are actually good, and the ape (cheesy as ape suits are today) is pretty endearing. But unlike BABE, the focus pitched on the animals are pretty tedious. This time, I think, giving the animals the gift of speech is a welcome asset. Director Caroline Thompson seemed to be distracted by the overall look of the film (the production design, from costumes to sets, are spontaneously elaborate) to strongly develop the script. The story lags a long in a drowsy, monotonous pace that could even put a few children to sleep. What could have been an eagerly acceptable fantasy with touches of engaging tragedy is an elaborate and fancy bore. BUDDY isn't a failure, but it fails more than it succeeds. At best, it's a promise that never really got off the ground. Rating: **1/2 out of 5.

    As a big fan of gorilla movies in general, I anticipated that this one would be great - and as for the gorilla effects, They were quite good, however - that is the only thing I can write about this flop. The film claims to be based on a true story but in effect, it does not even come close to what actually happened to "Buddy" - who in real life, was the famous Gargantua, sold to Ringling Bros. by our supposed "heroic" Gertrude Lintz, known by many animal enthusiasts as a woman who hardly had her animals' welfare in the best interest. As far as Buddy being portrayed as becoming aggressive, this was total fiction and at no time did the gorilla, in real life, resort to such behavior. buddy did, in fact, escape his wooden crate (not a plush cage room as depicted in movie) during a storm, to seek shelter and comfort in the house, which frightened Gertrude Lintz into selling him. No, Buddy was not released into a gorilla family surrounded by lush trees in a zoological paradise - he was abandoned in a wooden crate, deep in the back of a garage for some time with only a single light bulb for comfort and then sold to the circus - where he actually lived a better life having peanuts thrown at him until he died (historically the oldest living gorilla on record, by the way) before a show in Miami. Notice also, in the film, how Buddy grows older but the chimpanzees never age. (The chimps, by the way, were not raised simultaneously with other animals, including Buddy, as portrayed in the film)

    Curiously, it is Rene Russo's eyes and mouth--not Buddy the Gorilla's-- that emerge as the focal point of "Buddy", a Jim Henson Pictures production through Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope. Somehow, countless close-ups of Russo's face slipped passed in the post-production stages, and she literally fills the screen so many times the poor apes are upstaged. Unintentionally funny true story adapted from Gertrude "Trudy" Davies Lint's memoirs about a wealthy doctor's wife who turns their mansion into a menagerie for pets and wild-life. The movie goes beyond good intentions...it positively drips with earnest sincerity. The movie never sparkles with the kind of "family film" magic that it needed, and before too long both the people and the animals seem distinctly programmed (nothing here feels real). About ten minutes in, two chimpanzees are goofing around in Russo's kitchen and start throwing a butcher's knife back and forth (it misses Alan Cumming's head by inches); yet, no eyebrows are raised because it's all in a day's fun. Still, when full-grown gorilla Buddy gets crazy during a thunderstorm, the cops are called--and everyone stares at Buddy through the window while he busts up the living room furniture. The furniture should be the least of anyone's worries in this flabbergasting, do-gooder failure. But, at least we know Russo was in good hands: whenever director Caroline Thompson needs a good pick-up shot, she gives unstartled Rene another extreme close-up. I wonder what the lipstick budget was on this picture? ** from ****

    Trudy Lintz (Rene Russo) was one very fortunate lady many years ago. She was the wife of a wealthy doctor and had lots of extracurricular money. Her passion was animals and she devoted herself to providing a sanctuary for the furry ones on her property grounds. Trudy also raised two chimps in her home to be more like children. They dressed in clothes and had many amenities. One day, she learns of an abandoned baby gorilla. Knowing nothing about the large apes, she relies on her husband's medical abilities and expert advice to save the gorilla's life. Once out of danger, Trudy decides she will raise the gorilla, also, as one of her children. This works well for years and Buddy, the gorilla, is truly a remarkably intelligent addition to her home. But, Buddy is also a gorilla and his strength and curiosity become quite enormous. Will Trudy be able to keep Buddy under control? For those who love animals, Buddy is a must-see movie. Based on a true story, Trudy and her ape develop a relationship that is unique in the annals of animal history and lore. Of course, Buddy is not a real gorilla but a mechanical one, in the film, but he is very close to seeming totally real. Russo gives a nice performance as a lady ahead of her time and the supporting players are also quite nice. The costumes are exemplary, as befitting the earlier era of the story, and the settings and production values outstanding. But, most importantly, animals are here in abundance, not only Buddy, but the adorable chimps, the ducks, the rabbits, and so forth. For those who want to watch a film and be transported to animal heaven, here on earth, this is a great movie choice. All animal lovers, and even those who just want to watch a great family film, will go "ape" over Buddy.
