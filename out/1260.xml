 <sinopse>
  A genius 16-year-old 18th century poet and his mentor fall for each other, but, over time, their romantic relationship becomes bitter and violent.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  In 1871, Paul Verlaine (1844-1896), an established poet, invites boy genius Arthur Rimbaud (1854-1891) to live with Paul and his young pregnant wife, Mathiltde, in her father's home in Paris. Rimbaud's uncouth behavior disrupts the household as well as the insular society of French poets, but Verlaine finds the youth invigorating. Stewed in absinthe and resentment, Verlaine abuses Mathiltde; he and Rimbaud become lovers and abandon her. There are reconciliations and partings with Mathiltde and partings and reconciliations with Rimbaud, until an 1873 incident with a pistol sends one of them to prison. Codas dramatize the poets' final meeting and last illnesses.

    Once again I have to re-post. I guess whoever disagreed with my review felt it better to report me than let me speak my mind. Probably another Marxist who doesn't believe in free speech if it doesn't coincide with his/her views. If you cant handle the truth, don't read my review! This is not a movie about two great poets. Its a movie about two narcissistic homosexuals. Its really sad that this movie spent 90% of its effort trying to promote these two great poets as anything more than self-indulged sociopaths. As a child of the 90's I've become quite aware that between the years 1985-1993 Hollywood did everything they could to promote the homosexual lifestyle in every way shape and form. What makes this movement so disturbing is that this movie actually was supposed to promote the "genius in purging of the soul" by using yet another drug, in this case, Absinthe. I dated a "by-sexual" girl from 1991-1994 and all her friends were "sicko" homosexuals like these two characters that loved this movie and view of life. But let me tell you, these people are narcissistic and evil to the very core. Don't believe me, hang out with these kinds of people for a couple of hours. You might just understand why people justify murder. The modern serial killer from 1970 to present bases his life on movies like this. I give this movie 2 out of 10 only hoping that decent people read between the lines of this directors intentional promotion of evil and insanity. These characters remind me of the guys who raped Andy Dufrene in Shawshanke Redemption.

    This historical drama, directed by Agnieszka Holland, focuses on the rocky relationship between the renowned 19th century French poets Arthur Rimbaud and Paul Verlaine. Total Eclipse is a based on a 1967 play by Christopher Hampton, who also wrote the screenplay. Based on letters and poems, it presents a historically accurate account of the passionate and violent relationship between the two 19th century French poets Paul Verlaine,played by David Thewlis; and Arthur Rimbaud,played by Leonardo DiCaprio, at a time of soaring creativity for both of them.Rimbaud is a teenage wunderkind known for his rebelliousness against conventional society and his surrealistic writing. He disrupts the life of Verlaine, a more conventional writer who is older and married to a dutiful young wife, Mathilde.The drunken Verlaine is unkind to Mathilde, even though her father is providing him with a house and an income to live on while he pursues his writing. Rimbaud overwhelms Verlaine, mocking his conventionality, constantly disrupting his domestic life,and somehow attracting the maniacal love of the older man. Despite its fascinating subject matter, Total Eclipse is both unflattering and loveless.It was a disappointing biography about the homosexual relationship of two famous French poets.Watching Verlaine and Rimbeau engage in endless arguments about the nature of love makes the film irritating and somewhat uninteresting.The only good thing about it is DiCaprio's presence.Nothing more.

    This story takes place in the 19th century where two French male poets, Verlaine and Rimbaud, start a taboo like love affair. Verlaine is recently married and Rimbaud is much younger and still single. They're both very passionate and talented, and the heated love affair between them soon creates a lot of trouble. The first thing that came to my mind was that it was extremely weird watching DiCaprio acting as a homosexual and even weirder watching him making a homosexual love scene. It must've taken a lot of bravery from DiCaprio playing a part like this one. The movie was just OK but not something I would want to watch once more. The greatest thing about this movie was of course Leonardo DiCaprio.

    A film that fails to live up to the provocative brazen confidence of the lives it depicts. DiCaprio manages to capture the arrogance of Rimbaud, but he has no opportunity to slide his youthful body into the intensity of Rimbaud's raw genius. Instead the filmmakers fetishise DiCaprio's body and his precocious pretense. They filmmakers suggest that Rimbaud has no care for love, sex or violence, taking them or leaving them with little thought, but they shy away from any sensuality or depth in their depiction of these perversely human tendencies. 150 years after the events they are depicting, the filmmakers, scandalised as they are with the bent of their material, are somewhat embarrassed about diving into the implications either visually or emotionally. Nothing is explained, the legend is barely depicted. This film is no excuse for other filmmakers to not deal with the material themselves.

    I revised my evaluation of this movie after almost five years of watching at least once every 8-10 months. I am deep lover of Rimbaud's poetry and of his character as a whole as a matter of fact. When I watched it the first time I probably had the typical gay teenagers' fascination towards the relationship that is depicted and the great performance by Di Caprio in interpreting probably the most difficult role he will ever interpret. The storytelling, direction and everything around it is so poor is almost embarrassing and the only reason this movie is getting a mere 6 (it should have gotten far worse) is the outstanding performance from Di Caprio that manages to link himself permanently to Rimbaud's figure. Everything should have been much more developed, the movie feels almost like the script was left at the first draft and never revised it. Hopefully someone else will try in the path of making some good movie Rimbaud-centred and hopefully someone will be as good as Di Caprio was in portraying him.

    On the surface, one would think that "Total Eclipse" would work as a film. A young and very gifted poet Arthur Rimbaud (played by Leonardo Di Caprio who looks the part, but cannot quite play it) is invited to Paris by Verlaine (Thewlis) and they become lovers and work together on some of the most revolutionary verse the literary world has ever known. Yet the problem with "Total Eclipse," from acclaimed Polish film-maker Agniezka Holland, was that its focus was all wrong. What makes Arthur Rimbaud and Verlaine fascinating is not their personalities, but the fact that they were troubled geniuses. If the focus was on genius and how it works, then the film may have worked. But instead all we see are Rimbaud and Verlaine searching for news ways of being cruel to each other and to others. This unpleasantly sadistic dynamic sometimes leads to some of the most lively and inspired scenes, such as when Verlaine ditches his wife and her mother at the train car and escapes with Arthur Rimbaud. But more often than not Rimbaud and Verlaine come across as so unpleasant, so vulgar, so mean-spirited, and so dull that they give us no reason to care about them or find them compelling or interesting. Moreover, since the victims of their malice are usually good people, it becomes even harder to like either of the main characters or to understand why they behave in the way they do. I kept asking myself, when I saw this film, "What was the point of it all? What was the method to this meanness or madness or whatever." Now possibly the justification for this is Rimbaud's philosophy of living life to the fullest. But is watching Rimbaud living life to the fullest interesting, when you see him stab Verlaine in the palm of his hand? Do you really want to see Verlaine beat his pregnant wife or set her hair on fire for no good reason? Do you really want to listen to this inane dialogue? Do you really want to watch Di Caprio's pointless belching which was probably put their for shock effect, but is more annoying than anything else? Do you really want to see a long list of sadistic acts which grow tiresome and repetitive as the film wears on? My answer would be "no," because unless there is some logic for why these things are done, then the film is little more than a boring and unpleasant mess. For the record, I do like certain films with sadistic violence. Luchino Visconti's The Damned was one and Stanley Kubrick's Clockwork Orange was another, but these film were done with a sense of style and sophistication. If Total Eclipse ever had a sense of style or sophistication, it remained largely hidden from me for most of this picture.

    Throughout the ages, there has always been a fine line between Genius and Insanity. The only way one discover which is which, is to troll the depths of hell and what you emerge with is the true nature of the man. Such is the story behind the movie " Total Eclipse " and the historical meeting between two notable French poets of the 19th century. The life of Paul Verlaine (David Thewlis) begins in 1871 when he was 28 as that is when he discovered young Arthur Rimbaud (Leonardo DiCaprio) age 17. Sharing a love for poetry, art, writing Absinthe, hashish and a zest for passionate living, the two embarked on a deep loving physical relationship and a troubling tumultuous affair which took the two over several countries and even prison. The movie is a fine rendition of the two tortured souls trying to fathom each other both physically and spiritually. Although each considered the other a wellspring of inspiration, their literary work often exacted a heavy toll on their relationship. Suffering for their art became a quest for self discovery and loathing of the boundaries set by the world. Eventually, thorough the haze of hatred and love, we see in the film the passion they left behind. The film is savagely real as director Agnieszka Holland and writer Christopher Hampton developed it. The end result is a monumental triumph for the lives of these giants. A real accomplishment in cinematic art and a definite Classic for the attentive viewer. ****

    Total Eclipse is the story of the relationship between two men who definitely made their mark on French literature. Poets Paul Verlaine and Arthur Rimbaud have been compared to Oscar Wilde and Lord Alfred Douglas, but aside from being gay the pairs have little in common. Wilde is a universally recognized talent who had the misfortune to fall in love with a spoiled young aristocrat in Douglas who had some pretenses to literary talent. Douglas was spoiled, but both he and Wilde conducted themselves well in public. Verlaine and Rimbaud were a pair of talented louts as Total Eclipse shows us in graphic detail. Wilde married for convention's sake at the time and did have two sons and was a loving husband. His is a Victorian Brokeback Mountain story. Verlaine was a drunk and an abusive husband who regularly beat on his wife and child who was totally fascinated by young Rimbaud. He was ten years older than Rimbaud in real life, the film does make him seem a great deal older. He did read some of Rimbaud's work as a teenage prodigy and sent for the country lad. You can feel sorry for Wilde and do in the films that tell his story. Verlaine as played by David Thewlis is a really hateful person, gay audiences can't work up any sympathy for him. However Rimbaud as played by Leonardo DiCaprio by look and talent makes you perfectly understand why Rimbaud became so obsessed with him. Verlaine was a political man, he was a supporter of the Paris Commune and was in fear of the police who would have loved to nail him on a morals charge if not on a political one. Rimbaud didn't have a political opinion in the world, he was a peasant kid from the Ardennes who partied hardy, drove Verlaine crazy and jealous, but both learned and fed off each other artistically. I found it interesting that Rimbaud and Verlaine flee to Great Britain of all places to be freer, the same place that in the next generation would persecute poor Oscar Wilde. DiCaprio and Thewlis play a couple of louts, but a fascinating pair of louts. Total Eclipse has both these guys eclipsing the supporting cast around them, that probably is the main weakness of the film. Still fans of both men shouldn't miss this film.

    In concept and execution, Total Eclipse is flawed. It is not a biopic, but a snapshot of the affair between Arthur Rimbaud and Paul Verlaine. For the artistically minded to question love and the insanity of genius, and not to follow the significant footsteps of the bohemian poets. However, it fails due to a kind of Americanisation of period costume drama. There is a mishmash of accents (American, British, French) undermining the nuance of the French tongue. I still can't understand why trained actors don't seem to have even a basic grasp of high school French, or why the producers and the director were scared of subtitles in an 'Art house' film. It's difficult to buy DiCaprio as Rimbaud (although in appearance he is well cast) as with an American accent he always seems obnoxious even when it is not his intention. Delivering fragments of Rimbaud's poems and philosophy in sound bites renders them hollow. Although he is aesthetically and historically on the mark, the tone and spirit of the portrayal is completely wrong. Another conceit is that this film marginalises Verlaine. The opening interstitial might as well read "Verlaine's poems were OK, but who cares?" Arthur was known to have an admiration for Verlaine long before the two met, and the love between them genuine. Here though, it is painted as a vampiric relationship of convenience. Paul clinging to Arthur for fear of being alone, Arthur bleeding Paul's influence and money dry. Hackneyed scenes of Rimbaud having 'visions' of the final years of his life had me gagging, and are inexcusable. The editing of the entire piece is atrocious, particularly Paul's trial. And there are inaccuracies for the sake of ludicrous symbolism. Verlaine shot Rimbaud in the wrist. Though as it is portrayed here, he is shot through the center of his hand, to tack on a gauche Christ metaphor. You are never assimilated into the world these people live in because of the accent problem, and the energies of every cast member shooting off in different directions. Making the effort, you will find yourself wanting to like this film more than it will allow you to. The intention is to make you cry at the end, as other critics attest, but I fail to see how. Total Eclipse tried very hard to alienate its audience, the problem is that it has largely succeeded. It sours the romantic notion of Rimbaud and Verlaine for those familiar with their work, and has the unfamiliar asking basic straightforward questions which it makes no attempt to answer. "Why would Verlaine keep putting up with Rimbaud's abuse", "Why was Rimbaud considered a genius? He seemed like an arsehole".

    This is a worthy and successful attempt to make a film about the famous literary and personal relationship between two great poets, Paul Verlaine and the young Arthur Rimbaud. How the French must have resented its being made in English! (But why did the French themselves never film this story, which is so fundamental to the mythology of their literature?) There is no use viewers and reviewers complaining that the characters are disgusting: everybody knows they were, and they would have been the first to admit it. This film has not been made for the wrong reasons, with fictional characters, but is a true story. It is rather disturbing to realize that absinthe has been legalised again and people are drinking it once more, when we see how it drove these two poets insane, which is what is really does, you know! The banning of absinthe should never have been lifted. It may be a pretty green colour, but it is not romantic or at all glamorous. One strange omission from this film is any of the poetry of either poet! Very few decent translations of Verlaine into English exist, because he used rhyme so much. But he was a great and soaring poet, and of course Rimbaud shattered all the moulds and basically founded modern poetry, and had the status of a god to the Surrealists. So it would have been good to hear some of their work, especially as it is all out of copyright and no one could have objected. The lack of the poetry stops people who do not already know it from appreciating the point of all this carrying-on. Verlaine and Rimbaud were appalling, violent, disorderly, and to call them extreme Bohemians doesn't go far enough: they were both quite mad as well. But then, many poets are, and often the finest poetry comes from the ones who are the craziest (David Gascoyne, whom I knew well, is an example, and Ezra Pound whom I knew less well was not what you could call well-balanced). It is often said that there is a fine line between genius and madness, but with poets, the situation is even more dire: to be a divinely inspired poet it seems that it is almost a requirement that you first lose your mind. (Exceptions are those with no fire in their temperament at all: Eliot, Perse, Valery, or those who have become spiritual beings while still on earth, such as Rilke.) Well, the performances and direction are excellent here. Agnieszka Holland is an inspired director, a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Wajda, and perhaps her greatest achievement was 'Washington Square' (1997). She is interested in art, not commerce, and congratulations to her for that! The young Leonardo Di Caprio, aged 20, was a scintillating, wild, and wholly convincing Rimbaud. You could believe every scene. David Thewlis was equally convincing as Verlaine, despite being rather too thin for the part (Verlaine was stockier and plumper, and Thewlis looks like he hasn't had a decent meal for ten years). Romane Bohringer was an excellent choice for Verlaine's wife, and plays it just right. The next year she would make her staggering pair of films, 'L'Appartement' and 'Portraits Chinois', in both of which she sets the cinema on fire. So the talent is there, and the film is delivered. If we find these people disturbing, it is because they were. But without this bizarre tale, twentieth century poetry would not have come into existence, because it was created by Arthur Rimbaud, and without Verlaine taking him under his wing it would never have happened. Christopher Hampton's screenplay is intelligent and thoughtful and well-crafted throughout. But then, that is what he does. It is good to have this on the screen, but for those who do not already know the story, it must be a real shocker. It is also not a film for 'homophobes', and if you don't want to see Leonard Di Caprio kissing a man on the mouth, look away now.

Do you really want to watch Di Caprio's pointless belching which was probably put their for shock effect, but is more annoying than anything else? Do you really want to see a long list of sadistic acts which grow tiresome and repetitive as the film wears on? My answer would be "no," because unless there is some logic for why these things are done, then the film is little more than a boring and unpleasant mess. For the record, I do like certain films with sadistic violence. Luchino Visconti's The Damned was one and Stanley Kubrick's Clockwork Orange was another, but these film were done with a sense of style and sophistication. If Total Eclipse ever had a sense of style or sophistication, it remained largely hidden from me for most of this picture.

    Throughout the ages, there has always been a fine line between Genius and Insanity. The only way one discover which is which, is to troll the depths of hell and what you emerge with is the true nature of the man. Such is the story behind the movie " Total Eclipse " and the historical meeting between two notable French poets of the 19th century. The life of Paul Verlaine (David Thewlis) begins in 1871 when he was 28 as that is when he discovered young Arthur Rimbaud (Leonardo DiCaprio) age 17. Sharing a love for poetry, art, writing Absinthe, hashish and a zest for passionate living, the two embarked on a deep loving physical relationship and a troubling tumultuous affair which took the two over several countries and even prison. The movie is a fine rendition of the two tortured souls trying to fathom each other both physically and spiritually. Although each considered the other a wellspring of inspiration, their literary work often exacted a heavy toll on their relationship. Suffering for their art became a quest for self discovery and loathing of the boundaries set by the world. Eventually, thorough the haze of hatred and love, we see in the film the passion they left behind. The film is savagely real as director Agnieszka Holland and writer Christopher Hampton developed it. The end result is a monumental triumph for the lives of these giants. A real accomplishment in cinematic art and a definite Classic for the attentive viewer. ****

    Total Eclipse is the story of the relationship between two men who definitely made their mark on French literature. Poets Paul Verlaine and Arthur Rimbaud have been compared to Oscar Wilde and Lord Alfred Douglas, but aside from being gay the pairs have little in common. Wilde is a universally recognized talent who had the misfortune to fall in love with a spoiled young aristocrat in Douglas who had some pretenses to literary talent. Douglas was spoiled, but both he and Wilde conducted themselves well in public. Verlaine and Rimbaud were a pair of talented louts as Total Eclipse shows us in graphic detail. Wilde married for convention's sake at the time and did have two sons and was a loving husband. His is a Victorian Brokeback Mountain story. Verlaine was a drunk and an abusive husband who regularly beat on his wife and child who was totally fascinated by young Rimbaud. He was ten years older than Rimbaud in real life, the film does make him seem a great deal older. He did read some of Rimbaud's work as a teenage prodigy and sent for the country lad. You can feel sorry for Wilde and do in the films that tell his story. Verlaine as played by David Thewlis is a really hateful person, gay audiences can't work up any sympathy for him. However Rimbaud as played by Leonardo DiCaprio by look and talent makes you perfectly understand why Rimbaud became so obsessed with him. Verlaine was a political man, he was a supporter of the Paris Commune and was in fear of the police who would have loved to nail him on a morals charge if not on a political one. Rimbaud didn't have a political opinion in the world, he was a peasant kid from the Ardennes who partied hardy, drove Verlaine crazy and jealous, but both learned and fed off each other artistically. I found it interesting that Rimbaud and Verlaine flee to Great Britain of all places to be freer, the same place that in the next generation would persecute poor Oscar Wilde. DiCaprio and Thewlis play a couple of louts, but a fascinating pair of louts. Total Eclipse has both these guys eclipsing the supporting cast around them, that probably is the main weakness of the film. Still fans of both men shouldn't miss this film.

    In concept and execution, Total Eclipse is flawed. It is not a biopic, but a snapshot of the affair between Arthur Rimbaud and Paul Verlaine. For the artistically minded to question love and the insanity of genius, and not to follow the significant footsteps of the bohemian poets. However, it fails due to a kind of Americanisation of period costume drama. There is a mishmash of accents (American, British, French) undermining the nuance of the French tongue. I still can't understand why trained actors don't seem to have even a basic grasp of high school French, or why the producers and the director were scared of subtitles in an 'Art house' film. It's difficult to buy DiCaprio as Rimbaud (although in appearance he is well cast) as with an American accent he always seems obnoxious even when it is not his intention. Delivering fragments of Rimbaud's poems and philosophy in sound bites renders them hollow. Although he is aesthetically and historically on the mark, the tone and spirit of the portrayal is completely wrong. Another conceit is that this film marginalises Verlaine. The opening interstitial might as well read "Verlaine's poems were OK, but who cares?" Arthur was known to have an admiration for Verlaine long before the two met, and the love between them genuine. Here though, it is painted as a vampiric relationship of convenience. Paul clinging to Arthur for fear of being alone, Arthur bleeding Paul's influence and money dry. Hackneyed scenes of Rimbaud having 'visions' of the final years of his life had me gagging, and are inexcusable. The editing of the entire piece is atrocious, particularly Paul's trial. And there are inaccuracies for the sake of ludicrous symbolism. Verlaine shot Rimbaud in the wrist. Though as it is portrayed here, he is shot through the center of his hand, to tack on a gauche Christ metaphor. You are never assimilated into the world these people live in because of the accent problem, and the energies of every cast member shooting off in different directions. Making the effort, you will find yourself wanting to like this film more than it will allow you to. The intention is to make you cry at the end, as other critics attest, but I fail to see how. Total Eclipse tried very hard to alienate its audience, the problem is that it has largely succeeded. It sours the romantic notion of Rimbaud and Verlaine for those familiar with their work, and has the unfamiliar asking basic straightforward questions which it makes no attempt to answer. "Why would Verlaine keep putting up with Rimbaud's abuse", "Why was Rimbaud considered a genius? He seemed like an arsehole".

    This is a worthy and successful attempt to make a film about the famous literary and personal relationship between two great poets, Paul Verlaine and the young Arthur Rimbaud. How the French must have resented its being made in English! (But why did the French themselves never film this story, which is so fundamental to the mythology of their literature?) There is no use viewers and reviewers complaining that the characters are disgusting: everybody knows they were, and they would have been the first to admit it. This film has not been made for the wrong reasons, with fictional characters, but is a true story. It is rather disturbing to realize that absinthe has been legalised again and people are drinking it once more, when we see how it drove these two poets insane, which is what is really does, you know! The banning of absinthe should never have been lifted. It may be a pretty green colour, but it is not romantic or at all glamorous. One strange omission from this film is any of the poetry of either poet! Very few decent translations of Verlaine into English exist, because he used rhyme so much. But he was a great and soaring poet, and of course Rimbaud shattered all the moulds and basically founded modern poetry, and had the status of a god to the Surrealists. So it would have been good to hear some of their work, especially as it is all out of copyright and no one could have objected. The lack of the poetry stops people who do not already know it from appreciating the point of all this carrying-on. Verlaine and Rimbaud were appalling, violent, disorderly, and to call them extreme Bohemians doesn't go far enough: they were both quite mad as well. But then, many poets are, and often the finest poetry comes from the ones who are the craziest (David Gascoyne, whom I knew well, is an example, and Ezra Pound whom I knew less well was not what you could call well-balanced). It is often said that there is a fine line between genius and madness, but with poets, the situation is even more dire: to be a divinely inspired poet it seems that it is almost a requirement that you first lose your mind. (Exceptions are those with no fire in their temperament at all: Eliot, Perse, Valery, or those who have become spiritual beings while still on earth, such as Rilke.) Well, the performances and direction are excellent here. Agnieszka Holland is an inspired director, a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Wajda, and perhaps her greatest achievement was 'Washington Square' (1997). She is interested in art, not commerce, and congratulations to her for that! The young Leonardo Di Caprio, aged 20, was a scintillating, wild, and wholly convincing Rimbaud. You could believe every scene. David Thewlis was equally convincing as Verlaine, despite being rather too thin for the part (Verlaine was stockier and plumper, and Thewlis looks like he hasn't had a decent meal for ten years). Romane Bohringer was an excellent choice for Verlaine's wife, and plays it just right. The next year she would make her staggering pair of films, 'L'Appartement' and 'Portraits Chinois', in both of which she sets the cinema on fire. So the talent is there, and the film is delivered. If we find these people disturbing, it is because they were. But without this bizarre tale, twentieth century poetry would not have come into existence, because it was created by Arthur Rimbaud, and without Verlaine taking him under his wing it would never have happened. Christopher Hampton's screenplay is intelligent and thoughtful and well-crafted throughout. But then, that is what he does. It is good to have this on the screen, but for those who do not already know the story, it must be a real shocker. It is also not a film for 'homophobes', and if you don't want to see Leonard Di Caprio kissing a man on the mouth, look away now.

    Once again I have to re-post. I guess whoever disagreed with my review felt it better to report me than let me speak my mind. Probably another Marxist who doesn't believe in free speech if it doesn't coincide with his/her views. If you cant handle the truth, don't read my review! This is not a movie about two great poets. Its a movie about two narcissistic homosexuals. Its really sad that this movie spent 90% of its effort trying to promote these two great poets as anything more than self-indulged sociopaths. As a child of the 90's I've become quite aware that between the years 1985-1993 Hollywood did everything they could to promote the homosexual lifestyle in every way shape and form. What makes this movement so disturbing is that this movie actually was supposed to promote the "genius in purging of the soul" by using yet another drug, in this case, Absinthe. I dated a "by-sexual" girl from 1991-1994 and all her friends were "sicko" homosexuals like these two characters that loved this movie and view of life. But let me tell you, these people are narcissistic and evil to the very core. Don't believe me, hang out with these kinds of people for a couple of hours. You might just understand why people justify murder. The modern serial killer from 1970 to present bases his life on movies like this. I give this movie 2 out of 10 only hoping that decent people read between the lines of this directors intentional promotion of evil and insanity. These characters remind me of the guys who raped Andy Dufrene in Shawshanke Redemption.

    This historical drama, directed by Agnieszka Holland, focuses on the rocky relationship between the renowned 19th century French poets Arthur Rimbaud and Paul Verlaine. Total Eclipse is a based on a 1967 play by Christopher Hampton, who also wrote the screenplay. Based on letters and poems, it presents a historically accurate account of the passionate and violent relationship between the two 19th century French poets Paul Verlaine,played by David Thewlis; and Arthur Rimbaud,played by Leonardo DiCaprio, at a time of soaring creativity for both of them.Rimbaud is a teenage wunderkind known for his rebelliousness against conventional society and his surrealistic writing. He disrupts the life of Verlaine, a more conventional writer who is older and married to a dutiful young wife, Mathilde.The drunken Verlaine is unkind to Mathilde, even though her father is providing him with a house and an income to live on while he pursues his writing. Rimbaud overwhelms Verlaine, mocking his conventionality, constantly disrupting his domestic life,and somehow attracting the maniacal love of the older man. Despite its fascinating subject matter, Total Eclipse is both unflattering and loveless.It was a disappointing biography about the homosexual relationship of two famous French poets.Watching Verlaine and Rimbeau engage in endless arguments about the nature of love makes the film irritating and somewhat uninteresting.The only good thing about it is DiCaprio's presence.Nothing more.

    This story takes place in the 19th century where two French male poets, Verlaine and Rimbaud, start a taboo like love affair. Verlaine is recently married and Rimbaud is much younger and still single. They're both very passionate and talented, and the heated love affair between them soon creates a lot of trouble. The first thing that came to my mind was that it was extremely weird watching DiCaprio acting as a homosexual and even weirder watching him making a homosexual love scene. It must've taken a lot of bravery from DiCaprio playing a part like this one. The movie was just OK but not something I would want to watch once more. The greatest thing about this movie was of course Leonardo DiCaprio.

    A film that fails to live up to the provocative brazen confidence of the lives it depicts. DiCaprio manages to capture the arrogance of Rimbaud, but he has no opportunity to slide his youthful body into the intensity of Rimbaud's raw genius. Instead the filmmakers fetishise DiCaprio's body and his precocious pretense. They filmmakers suggest that Rimbaud has no care for love, sex or violence, taking them or leaving them with little thought, but they shy away from any sensuality or depth in their depiction of these perversely human tendencies. 150 years after the events they are depicting, the filmmakers, scandalised as they are with the bent of their material, are somewhat embarrassed about diving into the implications either visually or emotionally. Nothing is explained, the legend is barely depicted. This film is no excuse for other filmmakers to not deal with the material themselves.

    I revised my evaluation of this movie after almost five years of watching at least once every 8-10 months. I am deep lover of Rimbaud's poetry and of his character as a whole as a matter of fact. When I watched it the first time I probably had the typical gay teenagers' fascination towards the relationship that is depicted and the great performance by Di Caprio in interpreting probably the most difficult role he will ever interpret. The storytelling, direction and everything around it is so poor is almost embarrassing and the only reason this movie is getting a mere 6 (it should have gotten far worse) is the outstanding performance from Di Caprio that manages to link himself permanently to Rimbaud's figure. Everything should have been much more developed, the movie feels almost like the script was left at the first draft and never revised it. Hopefully someone else will try in the path of making some good movie Rimbaud-centred and hopefully someone will be as good as Di Caprio was in portraying him.

    On the surface, one would think that "Total Eclipse" would work as a film. A young and very gifted poet Arthur Rimbaud (played by Leonardo Di Caprio who looks the part, but cannot quite play it) is invited to Paris by Verlaine (Thewlis) and they become lovers and work together on some of the most revolutionary verse the literary world has ever known. Yet the problem with "Total Eclipse," from acclaimed Polish film-maker Agniezka Holland, was that its focus was all wrong. What makes Arthur Rimbaud and Verlaine fascinating is not their personalities, but the fact that they were troubled geniuses. If the focus was on genius and how it works, then the film may have worked. But instead all we see are Rimbaud and Verlaine searching for news ways of being cruel to each other and to others. This unpleasantly sadistic dynamic sometimes leads to some of the most lively and inspired scenes, such as when Verlaine ditches his wife and her mother at the train car and escapes with Arthur Rimbaud. But more often than not Rimbaud and Verlaine come across as so unpleasant, so vulgar, so mean-spirited, and so dull that they give us no reason to care about them or find them compelling or interesting. Moreover, since the victims of their malice are usually good people, it becomes even harder to like either of the main characters or to understand why they behave in the way they do. I kept asking myself, when I saw this film, "What was the point of it all? What was the method to this meanness or madness or whatever." Now possibly the justification for this is Rimbaud's philosophy of living life to the fullest. But is watching Rimbaud living life to the fullest interesting, when you see him stab Verlaine in the palm of his hand? Do you really want to see Verlaine beat his pregnant wife or set her hair on fire for no good reason? Do you really want to listen to this inane dialogue? Do you really want to watch Di Caprio's pointless belching which was probably put their for shock effect, but is more annoying than anything else? Do you really want to see a long list of sadistic acts which grow tiresome and repetitive as the film wears on? My answer would be "no," because unless there is some logic for why these things are done, then the film is little more than a boring and unpleasant mess. For the record, I do like certain films with sadistic violence. Luchino Visconti's The Damned was one and Stanley Kubrick's Clockwork Orange was another, but these film were done with a sense of style and sophistication. If Total Eclipse ever had a sense of style or sophistication, it remained largely hidden from me for most of this picture.

    Once again I have to re-post. I guess whoever disagreed with my review felt it better to report me than let me speak my mind. Probably another Marxist who doesn't believe in free speech if it doesn't coincide with his/her views. If you cant handle the truth, don't read my review! This is not a movie about two great poets. Its a movie about two narcissistic homosexuals. Its really sad that this movie spent 90% of its effort trying to promote these two great poets as anything more than self-indulged sociopaths. As a child of the 90's I've become quite aware that between the years 1985-1993 Hollywood did everything they could to promote the homosexual lifestyle in every way shape and form. What makes this movement so disturbing is that this movie actually was supposed to promote the "genius in purging of the soul" by using yet another drug, in this case, Absinthe. I dated a "by-sexual" girl from 1991-1994 and all her friends were "sicko" homosexuals like these two characters that loved this movie and view of life. But let me tell you, these people are narcissistic and evil to the very core. Don't believe me, hang out with these kinds of people for a couple of hours. You might just understand why people justify murder. The modern serial killer from 1970 to present bases his life on movies like this. I give this movie 2 out of 10 only hoping that decent people read between the lines of this directors intentional promotion of evil and insanity. These characters remind me of the guys who raped Andy Dufrene in Shawshanke Redemption.

    This historical drama, directed by Agnieszka Holland, focuses on the rocky relationship between the renowned 19th century French poets Arthur Rimbaud and Paul Verlaine. Total Eclipse is a based on a 1967 play by Christopher Hampton, who also wrote the screenplay. Based on letters and poems, it presents a historically accurate account of the passionate and violent relationship between the two 19th century French poets Paul Verlaine,played by David Thewlis; and Arthur Rimbaud,played by Leonardo DiCaprio, at a time of soaring creativity for both of them.Rimbaud is a teenage wunderkind known for his rebelliousness against conventional society and his surrealistic writing. He disrupts the life of Verlaine, a more conventional writer who is older and married to a dutiful young wife, Mathilde.The drunken Verlaine is unkind to Mathilde, even though her father is providing him with a house and an income to live on while he pursues his writing. Rimbaud overwhelms Verlaine, mocking his conventionality, constantly disrupting his domestic life,and somehow attracting the maniacal love of the older man. Despite its fascinating subject matter, Total Eclipse is both unflattering and loveless.It was a disappointing biography about the homosexual relationship of two famous French poets.Watching Verlaine and Rimbeau engage in endless arguments about the nature of love makes the film irritating and somewhat uninteresting.The only good thing about it is DiCaprio's presence.Nothing more.

    This story takes place in the 19th century where two French male poets, Verlaine and Rimbaud, start a taboo like love affair. Verlaine is recently married and Rimbaud is much younger and still single. They're both very passionate and talented, and the heated love affair between them soon creates a lot of trouble. The first thing that came to my mind was that it was extremely weird watching DiCaprio acting as a homosexual and even weirder watching him making a homosexual love scene. It must've taken a lot of bravery from DiCaprio playing a part like this one. The movie was just OK but not something I would want to watch once more. The greatest thing about this movie was of course Leonardo DiCaprio.

    A film that fails to live up to the provocative brazen confidence of the lives it depicts. DiCaprio manages to capture the arrogance of Rimbaud, but he has no opportunity to slide his youthful body into the intensity of Rimbaud's raw genius. Instead the filmmakers fetishise DiCaprio's body and his precocious pretense. They filmmakers suggest that Rimbaud has no care for love, sex or violence, taking them or leaving them with little thought, but they shy away from any sensuality or depth in their depiction of these perversely human tendencies. 150 years after the events they are depicting, the filmmakers, scandalised as they are with the bent of their material, are somewhat embarrassed about diving into the implications either visually or emotionally. Nothing is explained, the legend is barely depicted. This film is no excuse for other filmmakers to not deal with the material themselves.

    I revised my evaluation of this movie after almost five years of watching at least once every 8-10 months. I am deep lover of Rimbaud's poetry and of his character as a whole as a matter of fact. When I watched it the first time I probably had the typical gay teenagers' fascination towards the relationship that is depicted and the great performance by Di Caprio in interpreting probably the most difficult role he will ever interpret. The storytelling, direction and everything around it is so poor is almost embarrassing and the only reason this movie is getting a mere 6 (it should have gotten far worse) is the outstanding performance from Di Caprio that manages to link himself permanently to Rimbaud's figure. Everything should have been much more developed, the movie feels almost like the script was left at the first draft and never revised it. Hopefully someone else will try in the path of making some good movie Rimbaud-centred and hopefully someone will be as good as Di Caprio was in portraying him.

    On the surface, one would think that "Total Eclipse" would work as a film. A young and very gifted poet Arthur Rimbaud (played by Leonardo Di Caprio who looks the part, but cannot quite play it) is invited to Paris by Verlaine (Thewlis) and they become lovers and work together on some of the most revolutionary verse the literary world has ever known. Yet the problem with "Total Eclipse," from acclaimed Polish film-maker Agniezka Holland, was that its focus was all wrong. What makes Arthur Rimbaud and Verlaine fascinating is not their personalities, but the fact that they were troubled geniuses. If the focus was on genius and how it works, then the film may have worked. But instead all we see are Rimbaud and Verlaine searching for news ways of being cruel to each other and to others. This unpleasantly sadistic dynamic sometimes leads to some of the most lively and inspired scenes, such as when Verlaine ditches his wife and her mother at the train car and escapes with Arthur Rimbaud. But more often than not Rimbaud and Verlaine come across as so unpleasant, so vulgar, so mean-spirited, and so dull that they give us no reason to care about them or find them compelling or interesting. Moreover, since the victims of their malice are usually good people, it becomes even harder to like either of the main characters or to understand why they behave in the way they do. I kept asking myself, when I saw this film, "What was the point of it all? What was the method to this meanness or madness or whatever." Now possibly the justification for this is Rimbaud's philosophy of living life to the fullest. But is watching Rimbaud living life to the fullest interesting, when you see him stab Verlaine in the palm of his hand? Do you really want to see Verlaine beat his pregnant wife or set her hair on fire for no good reason? Do you really want to listen to this inane dialogue? Do you really want to watch Di Caprio's pointless belching which was probably put their for shock effect, but is more annoying than anything else? Do you really want to see a long list of sadistic acts which grow tiresome and repetitive as the film wears on? My answer would be "no," because unless there is some logic for why these things are done, then the film is little more than a boring and unpleasant mess. For the record, I do like certain films with sadistic violence. Luchino Visconti's The Damned was one and Stanley Kubrick's Clockwork Orange was another, but these film were done with a sense of style and sophistication. If Total Eclipse ever had a sense of style or sophistication, it remained largely hidden from me for most of this picture.

    Throughout the ages, there has always been a fine line between Genius and Insanity. The only way one discover which is which, is to troll the depths of hell and what you emerge with is the true nature of the man. Such is the story behind the movie " Total Eclipse " and the historical meeting between two notable French poets of the 19th century. The life of Paul Verlaine (David Thewlis) begins in 1871 when he was 28 as that is when he discovered young Arthur Rimbaud (Leonardo DiCaprio) age 17. Sharing a love for poetry, art, writing Absinthe, hashish and a zest for passionate living, the two embarked on a deep loving physical relationship and a troubling tumultuous affair which took the two over several countries and even prison. The movie is a fine rendition of the two tortured souls trying to fathom each other both physically and spiritually. Although each considered the other a wellspring of inspiration, their literary work often exacted a heavy toll on their relationship. Suffering for their art became a quest for self discovery and loathing of the boundaries set by the world. Eventually, thorough the haze of hatred and love, we see in the film the passion they left behind. The film is savagely real as director Agnieszka Holland and writer Christopher Hampton developed it. The end result is a monumental triumph for the lives of these giants. A real accomplishment in cinematic art and a definite Classic for the attentive viewer. ****

    Total Eclipse is the story of the relationship between two men who definitely made their mark on French literature. Poets Paul Verlaine and Arthur Rimbaud have been compared to Oscar Wilde and Lord Alfred Douglas, but aside from being gay the pairs have little in common. Wilde is a universally recognized talent who had the misfortune to fall in love with a spoiled young aristocrat in Douglas who had some pretenses to literary talent. Douglas was spoiled, but both he and Wilde conducted themselves well in public. Verlaine and Rimbaud were a pair of talented louts as Total Eclipse shows us in graphic detail. Wilde married for convention's sake at the time and did have two sons and was a loving husband. His is a Victorian Brokeback Mountain story. Verlaine was a drunk and an abusive husband who regularly beat on his wife and child who was totally fascinated by young Rimbaud. He was ten years older than Rimbaud in real life, the film does make him seem a great deal older. He did read some of Rimbaud's work as a teenage prodigy and sent for the country lad. You can feel sorry for Wilde and do in the films that tell his story. Verlaine as played by David Thewlis is a really hateful person, gay audiences can't work up any sympathy for him. However Rimbaud as played by Leonardo DiCaprio by look and talent makes you perfectly understand why Rimbaud became so obsessed with him. Verlaine was a political man, he was a supporter of the Paris Commune and was in fear of the police who would have loved to nail him on a morals charge if not on a political one. Rimbaud didn't have a political opinion in the world, he was a peasant kid from the Ardennes who partied hardy, drove Verlaine crazy and jealous, but both learned and fed off each other artistically. I found it interesting that Rimbaud and Verlaine flee to Great Britain of all places to be freer, the same place that in the next generation would persecute poor Oscar Wilde. DiCaprio and Thewlis play a couple of louts, but a fascinating pair of louts. Total Eclipse has both these guys eclipsing the supporting cast around them, that probably is the main weakness of the film. Still fans of both men shouldn't miss this film.

    In concept and execution, Total Eclipse is flawed. It is not a biopic, but a snapshot of the affair between Arthur Rimbaud and Paul Verlaine. For the artistically minded to question love and the insanity of genius, and not to follow the significant footsteps of the bohemian poets. However, it fails due to a kind of Americanisation of period costume drama. There is a mishmash of accents (American, British, French) undermining the nuance of the French tongue. I still can't understand why trained actors don't seem to have even a basic grasp of high school French, or why the producers and the director were scared of subtitles in an 'Art house' film. It's difficult to buy DiCaprio as Rimbaud (although in appearance he is well cast) as with an American accent he always seems obnoxious even when it is not his intention. Delivering fragments of Rimbaud's poems and philosophy in sound bites renders them hollow. Although he is aesthetically and historically on the mark, the tone and spirit of the portrayal is completely wrong. Another conceit is that this film marginalises Verlaine. The opening interstitial might as well read "Verlaine's poems were OK, but who cares?" Arthur was known to have an admiration for Verlaine long before the two met, and the love between them genuine. Here though, it is painted as a vampiric relationship of convenience. Paul clinging to Arthur for fear of being alone, Arthur bleeding Paul's influence and money dry. Hackneyed scenes of Rimbaud having 'visions' of the final years of his life had me gagging, and are inexcusable. The editing of the entire piece is atrocious, particularly Paul's trial. And there are inaccuracies for the sake of ludicrous symbolism. Verlaine shot Rimbaud in the wrist. Though as it is portrayed here, he is shot through the center of his hand, to tack on a gauche Christ metaphor. You are never assimilated into the world these people live in because of the accent problem, and the energies of every cast member shooting off in different directions. Making the effort, you will find yourself wanting to like this film more than it will allow you to. The intention is to make you cry at the end, as other critics attest, but I fail to see how. Total Eclipse tried very hard to alienate its audience, the problem is that it has largely succeeded. It sours the romantic notion of Rimbaud and Verlaine for those familiar with their work, and has the unfamiliar asking basic straightforward questions which it makes no attempt to answer. "Why would Verlaine keep putting up with Rimbaud's abuse", "Why was Rimbaud considered a genius? He seemed like an arsehole".

    This is a worthy and successful attempt to make a film about the famous literary and personal relationship between two great poets, Paul Verlaine and the young Arthur Rimbaud. How the French must have resented its being made in English! (But why did the French themselves never film this story, which is so fundamental to the mythology of their literature?) There is no use viewers and reviewers complaining that the characters are disgusting: everybody knows they were, and they would have been the first to admit it. This film has not been made for the wrong reasons, with fictional characters, but is a true story. It is rather disturbing to realize that absinthe has been legalised again and people are drinking it once more, when we see how it drove these two poets insane, which is what is really does, you know! The banning of absinthe should never have been lifted. It may be a pretty green colour, but it is not romantic or at all glamorous. One strange omission from this film is any of the poetry of either poet! Very few decent translations of Verlaine into English exist, because he used rhyme so much. But he was a great and soaring poet, and of course Rimbaud shattered all the moulds and basically founded modern poetry, and had the status of a god to the Surrealists. So it would have been good to hear some of their work, especially as it is all out of copyright and no one could have objected. The lack of the poetry stops people who do not already know it from appreciating the point of all this carrying-on. Verlaine and Rimbaud were appalling, violent, disorderly, and to call them extreme Bohemians doesn't go far enough: they were both quite mad as well. But then, many poets are, and often the finest poetry comes from the ones who are the craziest (David Gascoyne, whom I knew well, is an example, and Ezra Pound whom I knew less well was not what you could call well-balanced). It is often said that there is a fine line between genius and madness, but with poets, the situation is even more dire: to be a divinely inspired poet it seems that it is almost a requirement that you first lose your mind. (Exceptions are those with no fire in their temperament at all: Eliot, Perse, Valery, or those who have become spiritual beings while still on earth, such as Rilke.) Well, the performances and direction are excellent here. Agnieszka Holland is an inspired director, a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Wajda, and perhaps her greatest achievement was 'Washington Square' (1997). She is interested in art, not commerce, and congratulations to her for that! The young Leonardo Di Caprio, aged 20, was a scintillating, wild, and wholly convincing Rimbaud. You could believe every scene. David Thewlis was equally convincing as Verlaine, despite being rather too thin for the part (Verlaine was stockier and plumper, and Thewlis looks like he hasn't had a decent meal for ten years). Romane Bohringer was an excellent choice for Verlaine's wife, and plays it just right. The next year she would make her staggering pair of films, 'L'Appartement' and 'Portraits Chinois', in both of which she sets the cinema on fire. So the talent is there, and the film is delivered. If we find these people disturbing, it is because they were. But without this bizarre tale, twentieth century poetry would not have come into existence, because it was created by Arthur Rimbaud, and without Verlaine taking him under his wing it would never have happened. Christopher Hampton's screenplay is intelligent and thoughtful and well-crafted throughout. But then, that is what he does. It is good to have this on the screen, but for those who do not already know the story, it must be a real shocker. It is also not a film for 'homophobes', and if you don't want to see Leonard Di Caprio kissing a man on the mouth, look away now.

    Total Eclipse is the story of the relationship between two men who definitely made their mark on French literature. Poets Paul Verlaine and Arthur Rimbaud have been compared to Oscar Wilde and Lord Alfred Douglas, but aside from being gay the pairs have little in common. Wilde is a universally recognized talent who had the misfortune to fall in love with a spoiled young aristocrat in Douglas who had some pretenses to literary talent. Douglas was spoiled, but both he and Wilde conducted themselves well in public. Verlaine and Rimbaud were a pair of talented louts as Total Eclipse shows us in graphic detail. Wilde married for convention's sake at the time and did have two sons and was a loving husband. His is a Victorian Brokeback Mountain story. Verlaine was a drunk and an abusive husband who regularly beat on his wife and child who was totally fascinated by young Rimbaud. He was ten years older than Rimbaud in real life, the film does make him seem a great deal older. He did read some of Rimbaud's work as a teenage prodigy and sent for the country lad. You can feel sorry for Wilde and do in the films that tell his story. Verlaine as played by David Thewlis is a really hateful person, gay audiences can't work up any sympathy for him. However Rimbaud as played by Leonardo DiCaprio by look and talent makes you perfectly understand why Rimbaud became so obsessed with him. Verlaine was a political man, he was a supporter of the Paris Commune and was in fear of the police who would have loved to nail him on a morals charge if not on a political one. Rimbaud didn't have a political opinion in the world, he was a peasant kid from the Ardennes who partied hardy, drove Verlaine crazy and jealous, but both learned and fed off each other artistically. I found it interesting that Rimbaud and Verlaine flee to Great Britain of all places to be freer, the same place that in the next generation would persecute poor Oscar Wilde. DiCaprio and Thewlis play a couple of louts, but a fascinating pair of louts. Total Eclipse has both these guys eclipsing the supporting cast around them, that probably is the main weakness of the film. Still fans of both men shouldn't miss this film.

    In concept and execution, Total Eclipse is flawed. It is not a biopic, but a snapshot of the affair between Arthur Rimbaud and Paul Verlaine. For the artistically minded to question love and the insanity of genius, and not to follow the significant footsteps of the bohemian poets. However, it fails due to a kind of Americanisation of period costume drama. There is a mishmash of accents (American, British, French) undermining the nuance of the French tongue. I still can't understand why trained actors don't seem to have even a basic grasp of high school French, or why the producers and the director were scared of subtitles in an 'Art house' film. It's difficult to buy DiCaprio as Rimbaud (although in appearance he is well cast) as with an American accent he always seems obnoxious even when it is not his intention. Delivering fragments of Rimbaud's poems and philosophy in sound bites renders them hollow. Although he is aesthetically and historically on the mark, the tone and spirit of the portrayal is completely wrong. Another conceit is that this film marginalises Verlaine. The opening interstitial might as well read "Verlaine's poems were OK, but who cares?" Arthur was known to have an admiration for Verlaine long before the two met, and the love between them genuine. Here though, it is painted as a vampiric relationship of convenience. Paul clinging to Arthur for fear of being alone, Arthur bleeding Paul's influence and money dry. Hackneyed scenes of Rimbaud having 'visions' of the final years of his life had me gagging, and are inexcusable. The editing of the entire piece is atrocious, particularly Paul's trial. And there are inaccuracies for the sake of ludicrous symbolism. Verlaine shot Rimbaud in the wrist. Though as it is portrayed here, he is shot through the center of his hand, to tack on a gauche Christ metaphor. You are never assimilated into the world these people live in because of the accent problem, and the energies of every cast member shooting off in different directions. Making the effort, you will find yourself wanting to like this film more than it will allow you to. The intention is to make you cry at the end, as other critics attest, but I fail to see how. Total Eclipse tried very hard to alienate its audience, the problem is that it has largely succeeded. It sours the romantic notion of Rimbaud and Verlaine for those familiar with their work, and has the unfamiliar asking basic straightforward questions which it makes no attempt to answer. "Why would Verlaine keep putting up with Rimbaud's abuse", "Why was Rimbaud considered a genius? He seemed like an arsehole".

    This is a worthy and successful attempt to make a film about the famous literary and personal relationship between two great poets, Paul Verlaine and the young Arthur Rimbaud. How the French must have resented its being made in English! (But why did the French themselves never film this story, which is so fundamental to the mythology of their literature?) There is no use viewers and reviewers complaining that the characters are disgusting: everybody knows they were, and they would have been the first to admit it. This film has not been made for the wrong reasons, with fictional characters, but is a true story. It is rather disturbing to realize that absinthe has been legalised again and people are drinking it once more, when we see how it drove these two poets insane, which is what is really does, you know! The banning of absinthe should never have been lifted. It may be a pretty green colour, but it is not romantic or at all glamorous. One strange omission from this film is any of the poetry of either poet! Very few decent translations of Verlaine into English exist, because he used rhyme so much. But he was a great and soaring poet, and of course Rimbaud shattered all the moulds and basically founded modern poetry, and had the status of a god to the Surrealists. So it would have been good to hear some of their work, especially as it is all out of copyright and no one could have objected. The lack of the poetry stops people who do not already know it from appreciating the point of all this carrying-on. Verlaine and Rimbaud were appalling, violent, disorderly, and to call them extreme Bohemians doesn't go far enough: they were both quite mad as well. But then, many poets are, and often the finest poetry comes from the ones who are the craziest (David Gascoyne, whom I knew well, is an example, and Ezra Pound whom I knew less well was not what you could call well-balanced). It is often said that there is a fine line between genius and madness, but with poets, the situation is even more dire: to be a divinely inspired poet it seems that it is almost a requirement that you first lose your mind. (Exceptions are those with no fire in their temperament at all: Eliot, Perse, Valery, or those who have become spiritual beings while still on earth, such as Rilke.) Well, the performances and direction are excellent here. Agnieszka Holland is an inspired director, a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Wajda, and perhaps her greatest achievement was 'Washington Square' (1997). She is interested in art, not commerce, and congratulations to her for that! The young Leonardo Di Caprio, aged 20, was a scintillating, wild, and wholly convincing Rimbaud. You could believe every scene. David Thewlis was equally convincing as Verlaine, despite being rather too thin for the part (Verlaine was stockier and plumper, and Thewlis looks like he hasn't had a decent meal for ten years). Romane Bohringer was an excellent choice for Verlaine's wife, and plays it just right. The next year she would make her staggering pair of films, 'L'Appartement' and 'Portraits Chinois', in both of which she sets the cinema on fire. So the talent is there, and the film is delivered. If we find these people disturbing, it is because they were. But without this bizarre tale, twentieth century poetry would not have come into existence, because it was created by Arthur Rimbaud, and without Verlaine taking him under his wing it would never have happened. Christopher Hampton's screenplay is intelligent and thoughtful and well-crafted throughout. But then, that is what he does. It is good to have this on the screen, but for those who do not already know the story, it must be a real shocker. It is also not a film for 'homophobes', and if you don't want to see Leonard Di Caprio kissing a man on the mouth, look away now.

    Once again I have to re-post. I guess whoever disagreed with my review felt it better to report me than let me speak my mind. Probably another Marxist who doesn't believe in free speech if it doesn't coincide with his/her views. If you cant handle the truth, don't read my review! This is not a movie about two great poets. Its a movie about two narcissistic homosexuals. Its really sad that this movie spent 90% of its effort trying to promote these two great poets as anything more than self-indulged sociopaths. As a child of the 90's I've become quite aware that between the years 1985-1993 Hollywood did everything they could to promote the homosexual lifestyle in every way shape and form. What makes this movement so disturbing is that this movie actually was supposed to promote the "genius in purging of the soul" by using yet another drug, in this case, Absinthe. I dated a "by-sexual" girl from 1991-1994 and all her friends were "sicko" homosexuals like these two characters that loved this movie and view of life. But let me tell you, these people are narcissistic and evil to the very core. Don't believe me, hang out with these kinds of people for a couple of hours. You might just understand why people justify murder. The modern serial killer from 1970 to present bases his life on movies like this. I give this movie 2 out of 10 only hoping that decent people read between the lines of this directors intentional promotion of evil and insanity. These characters remind me of the guys who raped Andy Dufrene in Shawshanke Redemption.

    This historical drama, directed by Agnieszka Holland, focuses on the rocky relationship between the renowned 19th century French poets Arthur Rimbaud and Paul Verlaine. Total Eclipse is a based on a 1967 play by Christopher Hampton, who also wrote the screenplay. Based on letters and poems, it presents a historically accurate account of the passionate and violent relationship between the two 19th century French poets Paul Verlaine,played by David Thewlis; and Arthur Rimbaud,played by Leonardo DiCaprio, at a time of soaring creativity for both of them.Rimbaud is a teenage wunderkind known for his rebelliousness against conventional society and his surrealistic writing. He disrupts the life of Verlaine, a more conventional writer who is older and married to a dutiful young wife, Mathilde.The drunken Verlaine is unkind to Mathilde, even though her father is providing him with a house and an income to live on while he pursues his writing. Rimbaud overwhelms Verlaine, mocking his conventionality, constantly disrupting his domestic life,and somehow attracting the maniacal love of the older man. Despite its fascinating subject matter, Total Eclipse is both unflattering and loveless.It was a disappointing biography about the homosexual relationship of two famous French poets.Watching Verlaine and Rimbeau engage in endless arguments about the nature of love makes the film irritating and somewhat uninteresting.The only good thing about it is DiCaprio's presence.Nothing more.

    This story takes place in the 19th century where two French male poets, Verlaine and Rimbaud, start a taboo like love affair. Verlaine is recently married and Rimbaud is much younger and still single. They're both very passionate and talented, and the heated love affair between them soon creates a lot of trouble. The first thing that came to my mind was that it was extremely weird watching DiCaprio acting as a homosexual and even weirder watching him making a homosexual love scene. It must've taken a lot of bravery from DiCaprio playing a part like this one. The movie was just OK but not something I would want to watch once more. The greatest thing about this movie was of course Leonardo DiCaprio.

    A film that fails to live up to the provocative brazen confidence of the lives it depicts. DiCaprio manages to capture the arrogance of Rimbaud, but he has no opportunity to slide his youthful body into the intensity of Rimbaud's raw genius. Instead the filmmakers fetishise DiCaprio's body and his precocious pretense. They filmmakers suggest that Rimbaud has no care for love, sex or violence, taking them or leaving them with little thought, but they shy away from any sensuality or depth in their depiction of these perversely human tendencies. 150 years after the events they are depicting, the filmmakers, scandalised as they are with the bent of their material, are somewhat embarrassed about diving into the implications either visually or emotionally. Nothing is explained, the legend is barely depicted. This film is no excuse for other filmmakers to not deal with the material themselves.

    I revised my evaluation of this movie after almost five years of watching at least once every 8-10 months. I am deep lover of Rimbaud's poetry and of his character as a whole as a matter of fact. When I watched it the first time I probably had the typical gay teenagers' fascination towards the relationship that is depicted and the great performance by Di Caprio in interpreting probably the most difficult role he will ever interpret. The storytelling, direction and everything around it is so poor is almost embarrassing and the only reason this movie is getting a mere 6 (it should have gotten far worse) is the outstanding performance from Di Caprio that manages to link himself permanently to Rimbaud's figure. Everything should have been much more developed, the movie feels almost like the script was left at the first draft and never revised it. Hopefully someone else will try in the path of making some good movie Rimbaud-centred and hopefully someone will be as good as Di Caprio was in portraying him.

    On the surface, one would think that "Total Eclipse" would work as a film. A young and very gifted poet Arthur Rimbaud (played by Leonardo Di Caprio who looks the part, but cannot quite play it) is invited to Paris by Verlaine (Thewlis) and they become lovers and work together on some of the most revolutionary verse the literary world has ever known. Yet the problem with "Total Eclipse," from acclaimed Polish film-maker Agniezka Holland, was that its focus was all wrong. What makes Arthur Rimbaud and Verlaine fascinating is not their personalities, but the fact that they were troubled geniuses. If the focus was on genius and how it works, then the film may have worked. But instead all we see are Rimbaud and Verlaine searching for news ways of being cruel to each other and to others. This unpleasantly sadistic dynamic sometimes leads to some of the most lively and inspired scenes, such as when Verlaine ditches his wife and her mother at the train car and escapes with Arthur Rimbaud. But more often than not Rimbaud and Verlaine come across as so unpleasant, so vulgar, so mean-spirited, and so dull that they give us no reason to care about them or find them compelling or interesting. Moreover, since the victims of their malice are usually good people, it becomes even harder to like either of the main characters or to understand why they behave in the way they do. I kept asking myself, when I saw this film, "What was the point of it all? What was the method to this meanness or madness or whatever." Now possibly the justification for this is Rimbaud's philosophy of living life to the fullest. But is watching Rimbaud living life to the fullest interesting, when you see him stab Verlaine in the palm of his hand? Do you really want to see Verlaine beat his pregnant wife or set her hair on fire for no good reason? Do you really want to listen to this inane dialogue? Do you really want to watch Di Caprio's pointless belching which was probably put their for shock effect, but is more annoying than anything else? Do you really want to see a long list of sadistic acts which grow tiresome and repetitive as the film wears on? My answer would be "no," because unless there is some logic for why these things are done, then the film is little more than a boring and unpleasant mess. For the record, I do like certain films with sadistic violence. Luchino Visconti's The Damned was one and Stanley Kubrick's Clockwork Orange was another, but these film were done with a sense of style and sophistication. If Total Eclipse ever had a sense of style or sophistication, it remained largely hidden from me for most of this picture.

    Throughout the ages, there has always been a fine line between Genius and Insanity. The only way one discover which is which, is to troll the depths of hell and what you emerge with is the true nature of the man. Such is the story behind the movie " Total Eclipse " and the historical meeting between two notable French poets of the 19th century. The life of Paul Verlaine (David Thewlis) begins in 1871 when he was 28 as that is when he discovered young Arthur Rimbaud (Leonardo DiCaprio) age 17. Sharing a love for poetry, art, writing Absinthe, hashish and a zest for passionate living, the two embarked on a deep loving physical relationship and a troubling tumultuous affair which took the two over several countries and even prison. The movie is a fine rendition of the two tortured souls trying to fathom each other both physically and spiritually. Although each considered the other a wellspring of inspiration, their literary work often exacted a heavy toll on their relationship. Suffering for their art became a quest for self discovery and loathing of the boundaries set by the world. Eventually, thorough the haze of hatred and love, we see in the film the passion they left behind. The film is savagely real as director Agnieszka Holland and writer Christopher Hampton developed it. The end result is a monumental triumph for the lives of these giants. A real accomplishment in cinematic art and a definite Classic for the attentive viewer. ****

Based on letters and poems, it presents a historically accurate account of the passionate and violent relationship between the two 19th century French poets Paul Verlaine,played by David Thewlis; and Arthur Rimbaud,played by Leonardo DiCaprio, at a time of soaring creativity for both of them.Rimbaud is a teenage wunderkind known for his rebelliousness against conventional society and his surrealistic writing. He disrupts the life of Verlaine, a more conventional writer who is older and married to a dutiful young wife, Mathilde.The drunken Verlaine is unkind to Mathilde, even though her father is providing him with a house and an income to live on while he pursues his writing. Rimbaud overwhelms Verlaine, mocking his conventionality, constantly disrupting his domestic life,and somehow attracting the maniacal love of the older man. Despite its fascinating subject matter, Total Eclipse is both unflattering and loveless.It was a disappointing biography about the homosexual relationship of two famous French poets.Watching Verlaine and Rimbeau engage in endless arguments about the nature of love makes the film irritating and somewhat uninteresting.The only good thing about it is DiCaprio's presence.Nothing more.

    This story takes place in the 19th century where two French male poets, Verlaine and Rimbaud, start a taboo like love affair. Verlaine is recently married and Rimbaud is much younger and still single. They're both very passionate and talented, and the heated love affair between them soon creates a lot of trouble. The first thing that came to my mind was that it was extremely weird watching DiCaprio acting as a homosexual and even weirder watching him making a homosexual love scene. It must've taken a lot of bravery from DiCaprio playing a part like this one. The movie was just OK but not something I would want to watch once more. The greatest thing about this movie was of course Leonardo DiCaprio.

    A film that fails to live up to the provocative brazen confidence of the lives it depicts. DiCaprio manages to capture the arrogance of Rimbaud, but he has no opportunity to slide his youthful body into the intensity of Rimbaud's raw genius. Instead the filmmakers fetishise DiCaprio's body and his precocious pretense. They filmmakers suggest that Rimbaud has no care for love, sex or violence, taking them or leaving them with little thought, but they shy away from any sensuality or depth in their depiction of these perversely human tendencies. 150 years after the events they are depicting, the filmmakers, scandalised as they are with the bent of their material, are somewhat embarrassed about diving into the implications either visually or emotionally. Nothing is explained, the legend is barely depicted. This film is no excuse for other filmmakers to not deal with the material themselves.

    I revised my evaluation of this movie after almost five years of watching at least once every 8-10 months. I am deep lover of Rimbaud's poetry and of his character as a whole as a matter of fact. When I watched it the first time I probably had the typical gay teenagers' fascination towards the relationship that is depicted and the great performance by Di Caprio in interpreting probably the most difficult role he will ever interpret. The storytelling, direction and everything around it is so poor is almost embarrassing and the only reason this movie is getting a mere 6 (it should have gotten far worse) is the outstanding performance from Di Caprio that manages to link himself permanently to Rimbaud's figure. Everything should have been much more developed, the movie feels almost like the script was left at the first draft and never revised it. Hopefully someone else will try in the path of making some good movie Rimbaud-centred and hopefully someone will be as good as Di Caprio was in portraying him.

    On the surface, one would think that "Total Eclipse" would work as a film. A young and very gifted poet Arthur Rimbaud (played by Leonardo Di Caprio who looks the part, but cannot quite play it) is invited to Paris by Verlaine (Thewlis) and they become lovers and work together on some of the most revolutionary verse the literary world has ever known. Yet the problem with "Total Eclipse," from acclaimed Polish film-maker Agniezka Holland, was that its focus was all wrong. What makes Arthur Rimbaud and Verlaine fascinating is not their personalities, but the fact that they were troubled geniuses. If the focus was on genius and how it works, then the film may have worked. But instead all we see are Rimbaud and Verlaine searching for news ways of being cruel to each other and to others. This unpleasantly sadistic dynamic sometimes leads to some of the most lively and inspired scenes, such as when Verlaine ditches his wife and her mother at the train car and escapes with Arthur Rimbaud. But more often than not Rimbaud and Verlaine come across as so unpleasant, so vulgar, so mean-spirited, and so dull that they give us no reason to care about them or find them compelling or interesting. Moreover, since the victims of their malice are usually good people, it becomes even harder to like either of the main characters or to understand why they behave in the way they do. I kept asking myself, when I saw this film, "What was the point of it all? What was the method to this meanness or madness or whatever." Now possibly the justification for this is Rimbaud's philosophy of living life to the fullest. But is watching Rimbaud living life to the fullest interesting, when you see him stab Verlaine in the palm of his hand? Do you really want to see Verlaine beat his pregnant wife or set her hair on fire for no good reason? Do you really want to listen to this inane dialogue? Do you really want to watch Di Caprio's pointless belching which was probably put their for shock effect, but is more annoying than anything else? Do you really want to see a long list of sadistic acts which grow tiresome and repetitive as the film wears on? My answer would be "no," because unless there is some logic for why these things are done, then the film is little more than a boring and unpleasant mess. For the record, I do like certain films with sadistic violence. Luchino Visconti's The Damned was one and Stanley Kubrick's Clockwork Orange was another, but these film were done with a sense of style and sophistication. If Total Eclipse ever had a sense of style or sophistication, it remained largely hidden from me for most of this picture.

    Throughout the ages, there has always been a fine line between Genius and Insanity. The only way one discover which is which, is to troll the depths of hell and what you emerge with is the true nature of the man. Such is the story behind the movie " Total Eclipse " and the historical meeting between two notable French poets of the 19th century. The life of Paul Verlaine (David Thewlis) begins in 1871 when he was 28 as that is when he discovered young Arthur Rimbaud (Leonardo DiCaprio) age 17. Sharing a love for poetry, art, writing Absinthe, hashish and a zest for passionate living, the two embarked on a deep loving physical relationship and a troubling tumultuous affair which took the two over several countries and even prison. The movie is a fine rendition of the two tortured souls trying to fathom each other both physically and spiritually. Although each considered the other a wellspring of inspiration, their literary work often exacted a heavy toll on their relationship. Suffering for their art became a quest for self discovery and loathing of the boundaries set by the world. Eventually, thorough the haze of hatred and love, we see in the film the passion they left behind. The film is savagely real as director Agnieszka Holland and writer Christopher Hampton developed it. The end result is a monumental triumph for the lives of these giants. A real accomplishment in cinematic art and a definite Classic for the attentive viewer. ****

    Total Eclipse is the story of the relationship between two men who definitely made their mark on French literature. Poets Paul Verlaine and Arthur Rimbaud have been compared to Oscar Wilde and Lord Alfred Douglas, but aside from being gay the pairs have little in common. Wilde is a universally recognized talent who had the misfortune to fall in love with a spoiled young aristocrat in Douglas who had some pretenses to literary talent. Douglas was spoiled, but both he and Wilde conducted themselves well in public. Verlaine and Rimbaud were a pair of talented louts as Total Eclipse shows us in graphic detail. Wilde married for convention's sake at the time and did have two sons and was a loving husband. His is a Victorian Brokeback Mountain story. Verlaine was a drunk and an abusive husband who regularly beat on his wife and child who was totally fascinated by young Rimbaud. He was ten years older than Rimbaud in real life, the film does make him seem a great deal older. He did read some of Rimbaud's work as a teenage prodigy and sent for the country lad. You can feel sorry for Wilde and do in the films that tell his story. Verlaine as played by David Thewlis is a really hateful person, gay audiences can't work up any sympathy for him. However Rimbaud as played by Leonardo DiCaprio by look and talent makes you perfectly understand why Rimbaud became so obsessed with him. Verlaine was a political man, he was a supporter of the Paris Commune and was in fear of the police who would have loved to nail him on a morals charge if not on a political one. Rimbaud didn't have a political opinion in the world, he was a peasant kid from the Ardennes who partied hardy, drove Verlaine crazy and jealous, but both learned and fed off each other artistically. I found it interesting that Rimbaud and Verlaine flee to Great Britain of all places to be freer, the same place that in the next generation would persecute poor Oscar Wilde. DiCaprio and Thewlis play a couple of louts, but a fascinating pair of louts. Total Eclipse has both these guys eclipsing the supporting cast around them, that probably is the main weakness of the film. Still fans of both men shouldn't miss this film.

    In concept and execution, Total Eclipse is flawed. It is not a biopic, but a snapshot of the affair between Arthur Rimbaud and Paul Verlaine. For the artistically minded to question love and the insanity of genius, and not to follow the significant footsteps of the bohemian poets. However, it fails due to a kind of Americanisation of period costume drama. There is a mishmash of accents (American, British, French) undermining the nuance of the French tongue. I still can't understand why trained actors don't seem to have even a basic grasp of high school French, or why the producers and the director were scared of subtitles in an 'Art house' film. It's difficult to buy DiCaprio as Rimbaud (although in appearance he is well cast) as with an American accent he always seems obnoxious even when it is not his intention. Delivering fragments of Rimbaud's poems and philosophy in sound bites renders them hollow. Although he is aesthetically and historically on the mark, the tone and spirit of the portrayal is completely wrong. Another conceit is that this film marginalises Verlaine. The opening interstitial might as well read "Verlaine's poems were OK, but who cares?" Arthur was known to have an admiration for Verlaine long before the two met, and the love between them genuine. Here though, it is painted as a vampiric relationship of convenience. Paul clinging to Arthur for fear of being alone, Arthur bleeding Paul's influence and money dry. Hackneyed scenes of Rimbaud having 'visions' of the final years of his life had me gagging, and are inexcusable. The editing of the entire piece is atrocious, particularly Paul's trial. And there are inaccuracies for the sake of ludicrous symbolism. Verlaine shot Rimbaud in the wrist. Though as it is portrayed here, he is shot through the center of his hand, to tack on a gauche Christ metaphor. You are never assimilated into the world these people live in because of the accent problem, and the energies of every cast member shooting off in different directions. Making the effort, you will find yourself wanting to like this film more than it will allow you to. The intention is to make you cry at the end, as other critics attest, but I fail to see how. Total Eclipse tried very hard to alienate its audience, the problem is that it has largely succeeded. It sours the romantic notion of Rimbaud and Verlaine for those familiar with their work, and has the unfamiliar asking basic straightforward questions which it makes no attempt to answer. "Why would Verlaine keep putting up with Rimbaud's abuse", "Why was Rimbaud considered a genius? He seemed like an arsehole".

    This is a worthy and successful attempt to make a film about the famous literary and personal relationship between two great poets, Paul Verlaine and the young Arthur Rimbaud. How the French must have resented its being made in English! (But why did the French themselves never film this story, which is so fundamental to the mythology of their literature?) There is no use viewers and reviewers complaining that the characters are disgusting: everybody knows they were, and they would have been the first to admit it. This film has not been made for the wrong reasons, with fictional characters, but is a true story. It is rather disturbing to realize that absinthe has been legalised again and people are drinking it once more, when we see how it drove these two poets insane, which is what is really does, you know! The banning of absinthe should never have been lifted. It may be a pretty green colour, but it is not romantic or at all glamorous. One strange omission from this film is any of the poetry of either poet! Very few decent translations of Verlaine into English exist, because he used rhyme so much. But he was a great and soaring poet, and of course Rimbaud shattered all the moulds and basically founded modern poetry, and had the status of a god to the Surrealists. So it would have been good to hear some of their work, especially as it is all out of copyright and no one could have objected. The lack of the poetry stops people who do not already know it from appreciating the point of all this carrying-on. Verlaine and Rimbaud were appalling, violent, disorderly, and to call them extreme Bohemians doesn't go far enough: they were both quite mad as well. But then, many poets are, and often the finest poetry comes from the ones who are the craziest (David Gascoyne, whom I knew well, is an example, and Ezra Pound whom I knew less well was not what you could call well-balanced). It is often said that there is a fine line between genius and madness, but with poets, the situation is even more dire: to be a divinely inspired poet it seems that it is almost a requirement that you first lose your mind. (Exceptions are those with no fire in their temperament at all: Eliot, Perse, Valery, or those who have become spiritual beings while still on earth, such as Rilke.) Well, the performances and direction are excellent here. Agnieszka Holland is an inspired director, a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Wajda, and perhaps her greatest achievement was 'Washington Square' (1997). She is interested in art, not commerce, and congratulations to her for that! The young Leonardo Di Caprio, aged 20, was a scintillating, wild, and wholly convincing Rimbaud. You could believe every scene. David Thewlis was equally convincing as Verlaine, despite being rather too thin for the part (Verlaine was stockier and plumper, and Thewlis looks like he hasn't had a decent meal for ten years). Romane Bohringer was an excellent choice for Verlaine's wife, and plays it just right. The next year she would make her staggering pair of films, 'L'Appartement' and 'Portraits Chinois', in both of which she sets the cinema on fire. So the talent is there, and the film is delivered. If we find these people disturbing, it is because they were. But without this bizarre tale, twentieth century poetry would not have come into existence, because it was created by Arthur Rimbaud, and without Verlaine taking him under his wing it would never have happened. Christopher Hampton's screenplay is intelligent and thoughtful and well-crafted throughout. But then, that is what he does. It is good to have this on the screen, but for those who do not already know the story, it must be a real shocker. It is also not a film for 'homophobes', and if you don't want to see Leonard Di Caprio kissing a man on the mouth, look away now.

    Once again I have to re-post. I guess whoever disagreed with my review felt it better to report me than let me speak my mind. Probably another Marxist who doesn't believe in free speech if it doesn't coincide with his/her views. If you cant handle the truth, don't read my review! This is not a movie about two great poets. Its a movie about two narcissistic homosexuals. Its really sad that this movie spent 90% of its effort trying to promote these two great poets as anything more than self-indulged sociopaths. As a child of the 90's I've become quite aware that between the years 1985-1993 Hollywood did everything they could to promote the homosexual lifestyle in every way shape and form. What makes this movement so disturbing is that this movie actually was supposed to promote the "genius in purging of the soul" by using yet another drug, in this case, Absinthe. I dated a "by-sexual" girl from 1991-1994 and all her friends were "sicko" homosexuals like these two characters that loved this movie and view of life. But let me tell you, these people are narcissistic and evil to the very core. Don't believe me, hang out with these kinds of people for a couple of hours. You might just understand why people justify murder. The modern serial killer from 1970 to present bases his life on movies like this. I give this movie 2 out of 10 only hoping that decent people read between the lines of this directors intentional promotion of evil and insanity. These characters remind me of the guys who raped Andy Dufrene in Shawshanke Redemption.

    In concept and execution, Total Eclipse is flawed. It is not a biopic, but a snapshot of the affair between Arthur Rimbaud and Paul Verlaine. For the artistically minded to question love and the insanity of genius, and not to follow the significant footsteps of the bohemian poets. However, it fails due to a kind of Americanisation of period costume drama. There is a mishmash of accents (American, British, French) undermining the nuance of the French tongue. I still can't understand why trained actors don't seem to have even a basic grasp of high school French, or why the producers and the director were scared of subtitles in an 'Art house' film. It's difficult to buy DiCaprio as Rimbaud (although in appearance he is well cast) as with an American accent he always seems obnoxious even when it is not his intention. Delivering fragments of Rimbaud's poems and philosophy in sound bites renders them hollow. Although he is aesthetically and historically on the mark, the tone and spirit of the portrayal is completely wrong. Another conceit is that this film marginalises Verlaine. The opening interstitial might as well read "Verlaine's poems were OK, but who cares?" Arthur was known to have an admiration for Verlaine long before the two met, and the love between them genuine. Here though, it is painted as a vampiric relationship of convenience. Paul clinging to Arthur for fear of being alone, Arthur bleeding Paul's influence and money dry. Hackneyed scenes of Rimbaud having 'visions' of the final years of his life had me gagging, and are inexcusable. The editing of the entire piece is atrocious, particularly Paul's trial. And there are inaccuracies for the sake of ludicrous symbolism. Verlaine shot Rimbaud in the wrist. Though as it is portrayed here, he is shot through the center of his hand, to tack on a gauche Christ metaphor. You are never assimilated into the world these people live in because of the accent problem, and the energies of every cast member shooting off in different directions. Making the effort, you will find yourself wanting to like this film more than it will allow you to. The intention is to make you cry at the end, as other critics attest, but I fail to see how. Total Eclipse tried very hard to alienate its audience, the problem is that it has largely succeeded. It sours the romantic notion of Rimbaud and Verlaine for those familiar with their work, and has the unfamiliar asking basic straightforward questions which it makes no attempt to answer. "Why would Verlaine keep putting up with Rimbaud's abuse", "Why was Rimbaud considered a genius? He seemed like an arsehole".

    This is a worthy and successful attempt to make a film about the famous literary and personal relationship between two great poets, Paul Verlaine and the young Arthur Rimbaud. How the French must have resented its being made in English! (But why did the French themselves never film this story, which is so fundamental to the mythology of their literature?) There is no use viewers and reviewers complaining that the characters are disgusting: everybody knows they were, and they would have been the first to admit it. This film has not been made for the wrong reasons, with fictional characters, but is a true story. It is rather disturbing to realize that absinthe has been legalised again and people are drinking it once more, when we see how it drove these two poets insane, which is what is really does, you know! The banning of absinthe should never have been lifted. It may be a pretty green colour, but it is not romantic or at all glamorous. One strange omission from this film is any of the poetry of either poet! Very few decent translations of Verlaine into English exist, because he used rhyme so much. But he was a great and soaring poet, and of course Rimbaud shattered all the moulds and basically founded modern poetry, and had the status of a god to the Surrealists. So it would have been good to hear some of their work, especially as it is all out of copyright and no one could have objected. The lack of the poetry stops people who do not already know it from appreciating the point of all this carrying-on. Verlaine and Rimbaud were appalling, violent, disorderly, and to call them extreme Bohemians doesn't go far enough: they were both quite mad as well. But then, many poets are, and often the finest poetry comes from the ones who are the craziest (David Gascoyne, whom I knew well, is an example, and Ezra Pound whom I knew less well was not what you could call well-balanced). It is often said that there is a fine line between genius and madness, but with poets, the situation is even more dire: to be a divinely inspired poet it seems that it is almost a requirement that you first lose your mind. (Exceptions are those with no fire in their temperament at all: Eliot, Perse, Valery, or those who have become spiritual beings while still on earth, such as Rilke.) Well, the performances and direction are excellent here. Agnieszka Holland is an inspired director, a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Wajda, and perhaps her greatest achievement was 'Washington Square' (1997). She is interested in art, not commerce, and congratulations to her for that! The young Leonardo Di Caprio, aged 20, was a scintillating, wild, and wholly convincing Rimbaud. You could believe every scene. David Thewlis was equally convincing as Verlaine, despite being rather too thin for the part (Verlaine was stockier and plumper, and Thewlis looks like he hasn't had a decent meal for ten years). Romane Bohringer was an excellent choice for Verlaine's wife, and plays it just right. The next year she would make her staggering pair of films, 'L'Appartement' and 'Portraits Chinois', in both of which she sets the cinema on fire. So the talent is there, and the film is delivered. If we find these people disturbing, it is because they were. But without this bizarre tale, twentieth century poetry would not have come into existence, because it was created by Arthur Rimbaud, and without Verlaine taking him under his wing it would never have happened. Christopher Hampton's screenplay is intelligent and thoughtful and well-crafted throughout. But then, that is what he does. It is good to have this on the screen, but for those who do not already know the story, it must be a real shocker. It is also not a film for 'homophobes', and if you don't want to see Leonard Di Caprio kissing a man on the mouth, look away now.
