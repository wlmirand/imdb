    Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult is a hilarious movie with a decent storyline and yet again another brilliant and comedic performance from Leslie Nielsen as Frank Drebin.Its definitely not as good as the outstanding first Naked Gun,one of the funniest comedies ever made in my opinion,but I thought it was an improvement from the first Naked Gun,I thought there was a lot more hilarious scenes in this one and I really enjoyed the scenes at the Academy Awards towards the end of the movie.Some people may disagree,but I think this Naked Gun is an improvement over the second one and fans of the first won't enjoy it as much,but they will laugh a lot. Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen) must convince a gang that he is also a criminal in order to stop a bomb from being set off at the Academy Awards.

    The third installment in the series has Lt. Drebin retiring from the force, only to return to apprehend a terrorist. It's a case of diminishing returns, as the gags become more forced and the jokes become staler with each entry. Nielsen seems to be having a ball, as he reprises for the final time the role that showcased a flair for comedy that had been hidden through most of his career. It starts with a funny spoof of the train station steps sequence from "The Untouchables," which in turn was an homage to "Potemkin." Much of what comes after that is quite lame. Things do pick up towards the end as the action shifts to the Academy Awards, and a number of has-beens and B-listers gamely make cameo appearances as themselves.

    Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen) comes out of retirement to help Police Squad infiltrate a gang of terrorists planning to detonate a bomb at the Academy Awards. An excellent spoof on police and prison movies... with plenty of visual gags, quirky remarks (like the midget at the urinal). If you did not think that OJ Simpson was a funny guy, you need to see him in this role... wow, such a great actor! What can I say? Just a good, fun comedy... so sad we have lost Nielsen and Anna Nicole Smith... and OJ Simpson, sort of. At least we still have Mary Lou Retton, I guess.

    Look, I'm just not going to spend too much time on this (mostly) piece of crap. Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult suffers many defeats, probably the first/foremost: The absence of the original ZAZ (Jim Abrahams, David & Jerry Zucker) creators who brought you the masterpiece Airplane!, the way above average The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! and the mostly funny Top Secret! Them, like the police chief in the first two Naked Gun's knew well enough to distance themselves. Sure, it defeats some comedy disasters: unbelievably, it gets better as the movie progresses. How much better? Well, start on the absolute cutting room floor and work your way up a few inches. So, there were a few, I'll admit, funny segments in the 2nd half to finale, but most fell flat. Such as "Where's Waldo"  REALLY?!?  and an actual "Beavis and Butt-Head" tribute? Gimme a break. I failed to mention to amount of homophobia in the previous two chapters. This one tops the other two threefold. Yeah, I get one was mocking The Crying Game  duh, but it's still not a pleasant thing to see, when it's this vicious and not simply funny. I'll quickly skim the plot: Jane (Presley) and Frank (Nielsen) are fighting and leaving each other..again. Frank is also leaving Police Squad behind, as all movie cops have to retire somewhere in the story line. And some bad guy in jail (Ward) plans a break out, with Frank's help in the slammer undercover and metal-wrapped to avoid gay-sex in the showers. Ha ha ha ha ha ha and ha. No, I'm really not laughing at prison "dropping the soap" jokes. Literally  they went there. Anyways, the target is the Academy Awards for no other reason to blow up the place because this movie won't come close to winning any awards. Now that it appears I've completely bashed this movie, I will say there are a few funny moments: Jane's exit from Frank  really hilarious as were the fake movies and presentations at the Oscars. There were a few tiny, tiny moments sprinkled, but NOT ENOUGH for a recommendation. Seriously, this movie, despite some moderately funny moments, felt eerily spliced together and most as an afterthought. Even the Oscar fake movies, as humorous as they were, seemed rushed. This movie gets no endorsement from me, and thank goodness this would be the last  mark my words: I guarantee neither Leslie Nielsen or George Kennedy will anytime soon be appearing in a fourth movie, much less any feature length film. And you can forget about O.J. Simpson  who hilariously plays a dumb and distracted cop here  once he's released, he'll undoubtedly do something else incriminating.

    There are certain films that, on occasion, can escape almost any criticism and a fine spoof is one such occasion. The first two Naked Gun films are wonderful examples of the genre, filled with both visual gags and rapid one-liners that also remain funny after multiple viewings. Sadly, there can be too much of a good thing and this final entry into the series feels tired, strained and kinda desperate. Spoof stalwart Leslie Nielsen returns for the last time as Frank Drebin, Police Squad's most decorated officer who is retiring to spend time with his new wife Jane (Priscilla Presley). But Drebin can't ignore the threat of crime for long and after working undercover on behalf of his old buddies Ed Hocken (George Kennedy) and Nordberg (O.J. Simpson), Frank soon finds himself back in the fold and pitching his wits against determined bomber Rocco (Fred Ward) who is planning to blow up a critical target after he escapes from prison. Can Frank get the job done, even with the voluptuous distraction of Rocco's moll Tanya (Anne Nicole Smith)? The thing with all Naked Gun movies is to not take it seriously and "The Naked Gun 33 ⅓: The Final Insult" is no exception. It's as daft and stupid as peeing on an electric fence but sadly, the humour isn't quite as successful this time around. There is some noticeable repetition of gags - not just from the earlier movies but also from "Police Squad", the TV show that spawned this franchise - and some of the visual gags felt a little lame. Thank God Nielsen is still on form, perfectly cast as the straight-faced idiot working in his own little world with its own little logic. The rest of the cast simply work alongside him but some seem distracted almost - Smith has little to do besides pout and squeeze into some lingerie while Kathleen Freeman, as the matriarch of Rocco's gang, feels a little wasted. But despite the flaws and rough edges, there is still a good deal to laugh at and much to savour, as if you're watching aging rockers having one last hurrah before splitting up for good. The magic might have faded a little, the lines in the face are a bit more ragged and the tunes may sound a bit familiar but who cares if you're still having fun? It simply isn't as funny as the two earlier films - that is just the facts - but you can't knock it for lack of effort. But a much-reduced running time and a recycling of old ideas means that The Final Insult feels more like an epilogue instead of a glorious last chapter.

    Unlike the first Naked gun movie, produced in 1988, (Jim Abrahams) and (Jerry Zucker) weren't part of the writing this round, leaving (Pat Proft) and (David Zucker) alone in preparation of going solo afterwards. I felt that that left its bad mark here, where the movie was all about 2 acts only : getting to the bomb expert, then that expert's job at the Oscars ! Speaking about problems; true that the atmosphere was dynamically ironic, but the cast somewhat wasn't as dynamic. For instance (Leslie Nielson) seemed less energetic with obviously sick voice for most of the time, (George Kennedy) was almost having a paralysis. Not to mention the absence of many cameos, especially with the idea of parodying the Oscar night. Aside from the charming flavor of having these stars on screen, their presence assures the movie's conscience as a parody for flaws everybody admits. Away from that; there were many clever scenes (the parody of The Untouchables, the scene of the wife leaving the house..), and many clever lines (I used to be white ! / Yeah, I remember the Osmonds !). It reached the top during the Oscar night sequence, which is a classic act I can't get enough of despite numerous times of watching. Knowing that I write this in 2012, you must notice that the direction was smart and vivid. The pace was fine, without dragging on with one sequence pointlessly. How creative before how funny the laughs were, since they didn't incline totally to for instance the toilet humor, the fart jokes. And, most importantly, look at things like the characters' problems and solutions; the lead's wife wants to have a baby, but he has no capacity since leaving the police force, therefore his return will provide finally the self-respect he lost and needs. OH MY GOD. Back then, making a parody didn't mean being an idiot as a director or writer yet! Watch all of (Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer) recent spoofs to understand that better, and to cherish this movie, along with its era, more and more. It's an entertaining comedy, but more short and less full than its 2 antecedents. It marks the start of the end of the parody movie's golden age; the age which began with (Airplane!  1980) by (Jim Abrahams), (Jerry Zucker), (David Zucker) and (Pat Proft) "who had special thanks credit in that movie". One of the end's reasons is the breakup of that golden team. After the departure of (Jim Abrahams) and (Jerry Zucker), (Pat Proft) and (David Zucker) would go to play solo as well. Sorrowfully not a good thing for them, or us, as it turned out to be. Because next movies like Jane Austen's Mafia!, BASEketball, Wrongfully Accused, and Scary Movie 3 don't stand comparison to the insanity, precision, and movie culture of one Naked Gun movie. P.S : the Arab is always a terrorist in Hollywood movies ?? It's almost like how the Afro-American was always a servant in old Hollywood movies ! While that attitude became old itself, why the Arab status doesn't get old at all ?!

    Frank has retired, and is essentially a housewife, a whole new field where he can be incompetent. Jane continues working and now wants a baby, and the two aren't... having relations. He's called back to duty for one last mission(have you heard that one before?). The most prolific terrorist bomber in the US, Rocco(Fred Ward, a badass as usual... and just wait 'till you meet his mother, played by Kathleen Freeman!) may be planning his biggest score, so Drebin has to go undercover as a criminal, meeting up with him in jail. We have some fun with him trying to pass as such, and the new setting and situation are very welcome, since the first two followed essentially the same formula of solving a case. The main cast return and do well, and the new blood are great as well... then again, perhaps Anna Nicole Smith is a tad flat(...sorry) in her delivery, though she does give it her all when mugging. This does have several gags and jokes that just fail, and it was smart to end the series here(and don't get me wrong, it's an appropriate final chapter). The style of humor is the same as the others, with sometimes only a single element "off" in a scene and everyone reacts in a realistic manner and the laws of physics behave as they should, telegraphing the punchline, etc. Like the others, this has aged surprisingly well. There is some direct sexual stuff, albeit no nudity, and a little mild language, in this. I recommend this to any fan of spoofs and/or action/crime thrillers with tough, no-nonsense cops. 6/10

    Successful movie franchises usually tend to start of with a bang, only to slowly fade out like a candle with every new installment. "Naked Gun" however, it just kept getting better and better. The original was funny, so was 2 1/2, but to me 33 1/3 is really the one that never gets old. So many classic Leslie Nielsen scenes in this one, so many great quotes. The structure (or lack thereof) is similar to that of the first two, but the finale at the Oscars is by far my favorite of the three. The movie's also tightly paced, it doesn't go on for any longer than it needs to. It's not that the others are boring, but there's still a noticeable difference. Many disagree with this, but to me "The Final Insult" will always be Leslie Nielsen at his absolute peak. He has his character down to a tee here, too bad he didn't get better scripts in his later days. But oh well, I can always watch this one again.

    'Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult', the third and final film in the Naked Gun series, is a hilarious slapstick fare, where it's lead star, the late Hollywood Legend, Leslie Nielsen, proves once again, that he is an unstoppable/unforgettable talent. 'Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult' Synopsis: Frank Drebin comes out of retirement to help Police Squad infiltrate a gang of terrorists planning to detonate a bomb at the Academy Awards. 'Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult' is a faithful & satisfying sequel. It raises a lot of laughs, especially in the climax, the entire Academy-Awards Sequence, which is absolutely hilarious. Pat Proft, David Zucker & Robert LoCash's Screenplay is genuinely funny & extremely arresting. Peter Segal Directs this slapstick comedy, decently. Cinematography & Art Design, are worth a mention. Performance Wise: Nielsen, as mentioned before, is unstoppable in here. The legendary actor delivers a laugh-out-loud performance, and holds the film from start to end. Priscilla Presley supports well. George Kennedy is excellent. O.J. Simpson is fair. Fred Ward & Kathleen Freeman are passable. Others lend support. On the whole, 'Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult' is slapstick comedy at its best.

    The first film is a classic, the second while inferior is very enjoyable and this one is also very funny if for me the weakest of the series. It could have been longer, and there are moments in the movie where it does rely a little too much on the jokes and slapstick of the previous two. However, the dialogue is endearingly dumb and silly still, and the film is filled with gags and most work, the best for me being Frank's antics during Zadora's musical number and Frank wreaking havoc at the Oscars. The story is fast-paced and fun, the production values are of good quality, Priscilla Presley is strong support and there are some neat cameos from Pia Zadora and Fred Ward. And once again, Leslie Nielson is wonderfully deadpan. All in all, a very funny movie. 8/10 Bethany Cox

Because next movies like Jane Austen's Mafia!, BASEketball, Wrongfully Accused, and Scary Movie 3 don't stand comparison to the insanity, precision, and movie culture of one Naked Gun movie. P.S : the Arab is always a terrorist in Hollywood movies ?? It's almost like how the Afro-American was always a servant in old Hollywood movies ! While that attitude became old itself, why the Arab status doesn't get old at all ?!

    Frank has retired, and is essentially a housewife, a whole new field where he can be incompetent. Jane continues working and now wants a baby, and the two aren't... having relations. He's called back to duty for one last mission(have you heard that one before?). The most prolific terrorist bomber in the US, Rocco(Fred Ward, a badass as usual... and just wait 'till you meet his mother, played by Kathleen Freeman!) may be planning his biggest score, so Drebin has to go undercover as a criminal, meeting up with him in jail. We have some fun with him trying to pass as such, and the new setting and situation are very welcome, since the first two followed essentially the same formula of solving a case. The main cast return and do well, and the new blood are great as well... then again, perhaps Anna Nicole Smith is a tad flat(...sorry) in her delivery, though she does give it her all when mugging. This does have several gags and jokes that just fail, and it was smart to end the series here(and don't get me wrong, it's an appropriate final chapter). The style of humor is the same as the others, with sometimes only a single element "off" in a scene and everyone reacts in a realistic manner and the laws of physics behave as they should, telegraphing the punchline, etc. Like the others, this has aged surprisingly well. There is some direct sexual stuff, albeit no nudity, and a little mild language, in this. I recommend this to any fan of spoofs and/or action/crime thrillers with tough, no-nonsense cops. 6/10

    Successful movie franchises usually tend to start of with a bang, only to slowly fade out like a candle with every new installment. "Naked Gun" however, it just kept getting better and better. The original was funny, so was 2 1/2, but to me 33 1/3 is really the one that never gets old. So many classic Leslie Nielsen scenes in this one, so many great quotes. The structure (or lack thereof) is similar to that of the first two, but the finale at the Oscars is by far my favorite of the three. The movie's also tightly paced, it doesn't go on for any longer than it needs to. It's not that the others are boring, but there's still a noticeable difference. Many disagree with this, but to me "The Final Insult" will always be Leslie Nielsen at his absolute peak. He has his character down to a tee here, too bad he didn't get better scripts in his later days. But oh well, I can always watch this one again.

    'Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult', the third and final film in the Naked Gun series, is a hilarious slapstick fare, where it's lead star, the late Hollywood Legend, Leslie Nielsen, proves once again, that he is an unstoppable/unforgettable talent. 'Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult' Synopsis: Frank Drebin comes out of retirement to help Police Squad infiltrate a gang of terrorists planning to detonate a bomb at the Academy Awards. 'Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult' is a faithful & satisfying sequel. It raises a lot of laughs, especially in the climax, the entire Academy-Awards Sequence, which is absolutely hilarious. Pat Proft, David Zucker & Robert LoCash's Screenplay is genuinely funny & extremely arresting. Peter Segal Directs this slapstick comedy, decently. Cinematography & Art Design, are worth a mention. Performance Wise: Nielsen, as mentioned before, is unstoppable in here. The legendary actor delivers a laugh-out-loud performance, and holds the film from start to end. Priscilla Presley supports well. George Kennedy is excellent. O.J. Simpson is fair. Fred Ward & Kathleen Freeman are passable. Others lend support. On the whole, 'Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult' is slapstick comedy at its best.

    The first film is a classic, the second while inferior is very enjoyable and this one is also very funny if for me the weakest of the series. It could have been longer, and there are moments in the movie where it does rely a little too much on the jokes and slapstick of the previous two. However, the dialogue is endearingly dumb and silly still, and the film is filled with gags and most work, the best for me being Frank's antics during Zadora's musical number and Frank wreaking havoc at the Oscars. The story is fast-paced and fun, the production values are of good quality, Priscilla Presley is strong support and there are some neat cameos from Pia Zadora and Fred Ward. And once again, Leslie Nielson is wonderfully deadpan. All in all, a very funny movie. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult is a hilarious movie with a decent storyline and yet again another brilliant and comedic performance from Leslie Nielsen as Frank Drebin.Its definitely not as good as the outstanding first Naked Gun,one of the funniest comedies ever made in my opinion,but I thought it was an improvement from the first Naked Gun,I thought there was a lot more hilarious scenes in this one and I really enjoyed the scenes at the Academy Awards towards the end of the movie.Some people may disagree,but I think this Naked Gun is an improvement over the second one and fans of the first won't enjoy it as much,but they will laugh a lot. Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen) must convince a gang that he is also a criminal in order to stop a bomb from being set off at the Academy Awards.

    The third installment in the series has Lt. Drebin retiring from the force, only to return to apprehend a terrorist. It's a case of diminishing returns, as the gags become more forced and the jokes become staler with each entry. Nielsen seems to be having a ball, as he reprises for the final time the role that showcased a flair for comedy that had been hidden through most of his career. It starts with a funny spoof of the train station steps sequence from "The Untouchables," which in turn was an homage to "Potemkin." Much of what comes after that is quite lame. Things do pick up towards the end as the action shifts to the Academy Awards, and a number of has-beens and B-listers gamely make cameo appearances as themselves.

    Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen) comes out of retirement to help Police Squad infiltrate a gang of terrorists planning to detonate a bomb at the Academy Awards. An excellent spoof on police and prison movies... with plenty of visual gags, quirky remarks (like the midget at the urinal). If you did not think that OJ Simpson was a funny guy, you need to see him in this role... wow, such a great actor! What can I say? Just a good, fun comedy... so sad we have lost Nielsen and Anna Nicole Smith... and OJ Simpson, sort of. At least we still have Mary Lou Retton, I guess.

    Look, I'm just not going to spend too much time on this (mostly) piece of crap. Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult suffers many defeats, probably the first/foremost: The absence of the original ZAZ (Jim Abrahams, David & Jerry Zucker) creators who brought you the masterpiece Airplane!, the way above average The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! and the mostly funny Top Secret! Them, like the police chief in the first two Naked Gun's knew well enough to distance themselves. Sure, it defeats some comedy disasters: unbelievably, it gets better as the movie progresses. How much better? Well, start on the absolute cutting room floor and work your way up a few inches. So, there were a few, I'll admit, funny segments in the 2nd half to finale, but most fell flat. Such as "Where's Waldo"  REALLY?!?  and an actual "Beavis and Butt-Head" tribute? Gimme a break. I failed to mention to amount of homophobia in the previous two chapters. This one tops the other two threefold. Yeah, I get one was mocking The Crying Game  duh, but it's still not a pleasant thing to see, when it's this vicious and not simply funny. I'll quickly skim the plot: Jane (Presley) and Frank (Nielsen) are fighting and leaving each other..again. Frank is also leaving Police Squad behind, as all movie cops have to retire somewhere in the story line. And some bad guy in jail (Ward) plans a break out, with Frank's help in the slammer undercover and metal-wrapped to avoid gay-sex in the showers. Ha ha ha ha ha ha and ha. No, I'm really not laughing at prison "dropping the soap" jokes. Literally  they went there. Anyways, the target is the Academy Awards for no other reason to blow up the place because this movie won't come close to winning any awards. Now that it appears I've completely bashed this movie, I will say there are a few funny moments: Jane's exit from Frank  really hilarious as were the fake movies and presentations at the Oscars. There were a few tiny, tiny moments sprinkled, but NOT ENOUGH for a recommendation. Seriously, this movie, despite some moderately funny moments, felt eerily spliced together and most as an afterthought. Even the Oscar fake movies, as humorous as they were, seemed rushed. This movie gets no endorsement from me, and thank goodness this would be the last  mark my words: I guarantee neither Leslie Nielsen or George Kennedy will anytime soon be appearing in a fourth movie, much less any feature length film. And you can forget about O.J. Simpson  who hilariously plays a dumb and distracted cop here  once he's released, he'll undoubtedly do something else incriminating.

    There are certain films that, on occasion, can escape almost any criticism and a fine spoof is one such occasion. The first two Naked Gun films are wonderful examples of the genre, filled with both visual gags and rapid one-liners that also remain funny after multiple viewings. Sadly, there can be too much of a good thing and this final entry into the series feels tired, strained and kinda desperate. Spoof stalwart Leslie Nielsen returns for the last time as Frank Drebin, Police Squad's most decorated officer who is retiring to spend time with his new wife Jane (Priscilla Presley). But Drebin can't ignore the threat of crime for long and after working undercover on behalf of his old buddies Ed Hocken (George Kennedy) and Nordberg (O.J. Simpson), Frank soon finds himself back in the fold and pitching his wits against determined bomber Rocco (Fred Ward) who is planning to blow up a critical target after he escapes from prison. Can Frank get the job done, even with the voluptuous distraction of Rocco's moll Tanya (Anne Nicole Smith)? The thing with all Naked Gun movies is to not take it seriously and "The Naked Gun 33 ⅓: The Final Insult" is no exception. It's as daft and stupid as peeing on an electric fence but sadly, the humour isn't quite as successful this time around. There is some noticeable repetition of gags - not just from the earlier movies but also from "Police Squad", the TV show that spawned this franchise - and some of the visual gags felt a little lame. Thank God Nielsen is still on form, perfectly cast as the straight-faced idiot working in his own little world with its own little logic. The rest of the cast simply work alongside him but some seem distracted almost - Smith has little to do besides pout and squeeze into some lingerie while Kathleen Freeman, as the matriarch of Rocco's gang, feels a little wasted. But despite the flaws and rough edges, there is still a good deal to laugh at and much to savour, as if you're watching aging rockers having one last hurrah before splitting up for good. The magic might have faded a little, the lines in the face are a bit more ragged and the tunes may sound a bit familiar but who cares if you're still having fun? It simply isn't as funny as the two earlier films - that is just the facts - but you can't knock it for lack of effort. But a much-reduced running time and a recycling of old ideas means that The Final Insult feels more like an epilogue instead of a glorious last chapter.

    Unlike the first Naked gun movie, produced in 1988, (Jim Abrahams) and (Jerry Zucker) weren't part of the writing this round, leaving (Pat Proft) and (David Zucker) alone in preparation of going solo afterwards. I felt that that left its bad mark here, where the movie was all about 2 acts only : getting to the bomb expert, then that expert's job at the Oscars ! Speaking about problems; true that the atmosphere was dynamically ironic, but the cast somewhat wasn't as dynamic. For instance (Leslie Nielson) seemed less energetic with obviously sick voice for most of the time, (George Kennedy) was almost having a paralysis. Not to mention the absence of many cameos, especially with the idea of parodying the Oscar night. Aside from the charming flavor of having these stars on screen, their presence assures the movie's conscience as a parody for flaws everybody admits. Away from that; there were many clever scenes (the parody of The Untouchables, the scene of the wife leaving the house..), and many clever lines (I used to be white ! / Yeah, I remember the Osmonds !). It reached the top during the Oscar night sequence, which is a classic act I can't get enough of despite numerous times of watching. Knowing that I write this in 2012, you must notice that the direction was smart and vivid. The pace was fine, without dragging on with one sequence pointlessly. How creative before how funny the laughs were, since they didn't incline totally to for instance the toilet humor, the fart jokes. And, most importantly, look at things like the characters' problems and solutions; the lead's wife wants to have a baby, but he has no capacity since leaving the police force, therefore his return will provide finally the self-respect he lost and needs. OH MY GOD. Back then, making a parody didn't mean being an idiot as a director or writer yet! Watch all of (Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer) recent spoofs to understand that better, and to cherish this movie, along with its era, more and more. It's an entertaining comedy, but more short and less full than its 2 antecedents. It marks the start of the end of the parody movie's golden age; the age which began with (Airplane!  1980) by (Jim Abrahams), (Jerry Zucker), (David Zucker) and (Pat Proft) "who had special thanks credit in that movie". One of the end's reasons is the breakup of that golden team. After the departure of (Jim Abrahams) and (Jerry Zucker), (Pat Proft) and (David Zucker) would go to play solo as well. Sorrowfully not a good thing for them, or us, as it turned out to be. Because next movies like Jane Austen's Mafia!, BASEketball, Wrongfully Accused, and Scary Movie 3 don't stand comparison to the insanity, precision, and movie culture of one Naked Gun movie. P.S : the Arab is always a terrorist in Hollywood movies ?? It's almost like how the Afro-American was always a servant in old Hollywood movies ! While that attitude became old itself, why the Arab status doesn't get old at all ?!

The thing with all Naked Gun movies is to not take it seriously and "The Naked Gun 33 ⅓: The Final Insult" is no exception. It's as daft and stupid as peeing on an electric fence but sadly, the humour isn't quite as successful this time around. There is some noticeable repetition of gags - not just from the earlier movies but also from "Police Squad", the TV show that spawned this franchise - and some of the visual gags felt a little lame. Thank God Nielsen is still on form, perfectly cast as the straight-faced idiot working in his own little world with its own little logic. The rest of the cast simply work alongside him but some seem distracted almost - Smith has little to do besides pout and squeeze into some lingerie while Kathleen Freeman, as the matriarch of Rocco's gang, feels a little wasted. But despite the flaws and rough edges, there is still a good deal to laugh at and much to savour, as if you're watching aging rockers having one last hurrah before splitting up for good. The magic might have faded a little, the lines in the face are a bit more ragged and the tunes may sound a bit familiar but who cares if you're still having fun? It simply isn't as funny as the two earlier films - that is just the facts - but you can't knock it for lack of effort. But a much-reduced running time and a recycling of old ideas means that The Final Insult feels more like an epilogue instead of a glorious last chapter.

    Unlike the first Naked gun movie, produced in 1988, (Jim Abrahams) and (Jerry Zucker) weren't part of the writing this round, leaving (Pat Proft) and (David Zucker) alone in preparation of going solo afterwards. I felt that that left its bad mark here, where the movie was all about 2 acts only : getting to the bomb expert, then that expert's job at the Oscars ! Speaking about problems; true that the atmosphere was dynamically ironic, but the cast somewhat wasn't as dynamic. For instance (Leslie Nielson) seemed less energetic with obviously sick voice for most of the time, (George Kennedy) was almost having a paralysis. Not to mention the absence of many cameos, especially with the idea of parodying the Oscar night. Aside from the charming flavor of having these stars on screen, their presence assures the movie's conscience as a parody for flaws everybody admits. Away from that; there were many clever scenes (the parody of The Untouchables, the scene of the wife leaving the house..), and many clever lines (I used to be white ! / Yeah, I remember the Osmonds !). It reached the top during the Oscar night sequence, which is a classic act I can't get enough of despite numerous times of watching. Knowing that I write this in 2012, you must notice that the direction was smart and vivid. The pace was fine, without dragging on with one sequence pointlessly. How creative before how funny the laughs were, since they didn't incline totally to for instance the toilet humor, the fart jokes. And, most importantly, look at things like the characters' problems and solutions; the lead's wife wants to have a baby, but he has no capacity since leaving the police force, therefore his return will provide finally the self-respect he lost and needs. OH MY GOD. Back then, making a parody didn't mean being an idiot as a director or writer yet! Watch all of (Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer) recent spoofs to understand that better, and to cherish this movie, along with its era, more and more. It's an entertaining comedy, but more short and less full than its 2 antecedents. It marks the start of the end of the parody movie's golden age; the age which began with (Airplane!  1980) by (Jim Abrahams), (Jerry Zucker), (David Zucker) and (Pat Proft) "who had special thanks credit in that movie". One of the end's reasons is the breakup of that golden team. After the departure of (Jim Abrahams) and (Jerry Zucker), (Pat Proft) and (David Zucker) would go to play solo as well. Sorrowfully not a good thing for them, or us, as it turned out to be. Because next movies like Jane Austen's Mafia!, BASEketball, Wrongfully Accused, and Scary Movie 3 don't stand comparison to the insanity, precision, and movie culture of one Naked Gun movie. P.S : the Arab is always a terrorist in Hollywood movies ?? It's almost like how the Afro-American was always a servant in old Hollywood movies ! While that attitude became old itself, why the Arab status doesn't get old at all ?!

    Frank has retired, and is essentially a housewife, a whole new field where he can be incompetent. Jane continues working and now wants a baby, and the two aren't... having relations. He's called back to duty for one last mission(have you heard that one before?). The most prolific terrorist bomber in the US, Rocco(Fred Ward, a badass as usual... and just wait 'till you meet his mother, played by Kathleen Freeman!) may be planning his biggest score, so Drebin has to go undercover as a criminal, meeting up with him in jail. We have some fun with him trying to pass as such, and the new setting and situation are very welcome, since the first two followed essentially the same formula of solving a case. The main cast return and do well, and the new blood are great as well... then again, perhaps Anna Nicole Smith is a tad flat(...sorry) in her delivery, though she does give it her all when mugging. This does have several gags and jokes that just fail, and it was smart to end the series here(and don't get me wrong, it's an appropriate final chapter). The style of humor is the same as the others, with sometimes only a single element "off" in a scene and everyone reacts in a realistic manner and the laws of physics behave as they should, telegraphing the punchline, etc. Like the others, this has aged surprisingly well. There is some direct sexual stuff, albeit no nudity, and a little mild language, in this. I recommend this to any fan of spoofs and/or action/crime thrillers with tough, no-nonsense cops. 6/10

    Successful movie franchises usually tend to start of with a bang, only to slowly fade out like a candle with every new installment. "Naked Gun" however, it just kept getting better and better. The original was funny, so was 2 1/2, but to me 33 1/3 is really the one that never gets old. So many classic Leslie Nielsen scenes in this one, so many great quotes. The structure (or lack thereof) is similar to that of the first two, but the finale at the Oscars is by far my favorite of the three. The movie's also tightly paced, it doesn't go on for any longer than it needs to. It's not that the others are boring, but there's still a noticeable difference. Many disagree with this, but to me "The Final Insult" will always be Leslie Nielsen at his absolute peak. He has his character down to a tee here, too bad he didn't get better scripts in his later days. But oh well, I can always watch this one again.

    'Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult', the third and final film in the Naked Gun series, is a hilarious slapstick fare, where it's lead star, the late Hollywood Legend, Leslie Nielsen, proves once again, that he is an unstoppable/unforgettable talent. 'Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult' Synopsis: Frank Drebin comes out of retirement to help Police Squad infiltrate a gang of terrorists planning to detonate a bomb at the Academy Awards. 'Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult' is a faithful & satisfying sequel. It raises a lot of laughs, especially in the climax, the entire Academy-Awards Sequence, which is absolutely hilarious. Pat Proft, David Zucker & Robert LoCash's Screenplay is genuinely funny & extremely arresting. Peter Segal Directs this slapstick comedy, decently. Cinematography & Art Design, are worth a mention. Performance Wise: Nielsen, as mentioned before, is unstoppable in here. The legendary actor delivers a laugh-out-loud performance, and holds the film from start to end. Priscilla Presley supports well. George Kennedy is excellent. O.J. Simpson is fair. Fred Ward & Kathleen Freeman are passable. Others lend support. On the whole, 'Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult' is slapstick comedy at its best.

    The first film is a classic, the second while inferior is very enjoyable and this one is also very funny if for me the weakest of the series. It could have been longer, and there are moments in the movie where it does rely a little too much on the jokes and slapstick of the previous two. However, the dialogue is endearingly dumb and silly still, and the film is filled with gags and most work, the best for me being Frank's antics during Zadora's musical number and Frank wreaking havoc at the Oscars. The story is fast-paced and fun, the production values are of good quality, Priscilla Presley is strong support and there are some neat cameos from Pia Zadora and Fred Ward. And once again, Leslie Nielson is wonderfully deadpan. All in all, a very funny movie. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult is a hilarious movie with a decent storyline and yet again another brilliant and comedic performance from Leslie Nielsen as Frank Drebin.Its definitely not as good as the outstanding first Naked Gun,one of the funniest comedies ever made in my opinion,but I thought it was an improvement from the first Naked Gun,I thought there was a lot more hilarious scenes in this one and I really enjoyed the scenes at the Academy Awards towards the end of the movie.Some people may disagree,but I think this Naked Gun is an improvement over the second one and fans of the first won't enjoy it as much,but they will laugh a lot. Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen) must convince a gang that he is also a criminal in order to stop a bomb from being set off at the Academy Awards.

    The third installment in the series has Lt. Drebin retiring from the force, only to return to apprehend a terrorist. It's a case of diminishing returns, as the gags become more forced and the jokes become staler with each entry. Nielsen seems to be having a ball, as he reprises for the final time the role that showcased a flair for comedy that had been hidden through most of his career. It starts with a funny spoof of the train station steps sequence from "The Untouchables," which in turn was an homage to "Potemkin." Much of what comes after that is quite lame. Things do pick up towards the end as the action shifts to the Academy Awards, and a number of has-beens and B-listers gamely make cameo appearances as themselves.

    Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen) comes out of retirement to help Police Squad infiltrate a gang of terrorists planning to detonate a bomb at the Academy Awards. An excellent spoof on police and prison movies... with plenty of visual gags, quirky remarks (like the midget at the urinal). If you did not think that OJ Simpson was a funny guy, you need to see him in this role... wow, such a great actor! What can I say? Just a good, fun comedy... so sad we have lost Nielsen and Anna Nicole Smith... and OJ Simpson, sort of. At least we still have Mary Lou Retton, I guess.

    Look, I'm just not going to spend too much time on this (mostly) piece of crap. Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult suffers many defeats, probably the first/foremost: The absence of the original ZAZ (Jim Abrahams, David & Jerry Zucker) creators who brought you the masterpiece Airplane!, the way above average The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! and the mostly funny Top Secret! Them, like the police chief in the first two Naked Gun's knew well enough to distance themselves. Sure, it defeats some comedy disasters: unbelievably, it gets better as the movie progresses. How much better? Well, start on the absolute cutting room floor and work your way up a few inches. So, there were a few, I'll admit, funny segments in the 2nd half to finale, but most fell flat. Such as "Where's Waldo"  REALLY?!?  and an actual "Beavis and Butt-Head" tribute? Gimme a break. I failed to mention to amount of homophobia in the previous two chapters. This one tops the other two threefold. Yeah, I get one was mocking The Crying Game  duh, but it's still not a pleasant thing to see, when it's this vicious and not simply funny. I'll quickly skim the plot: Jane (Presley) and Frank (Nielsen) are fighting and leaving each other..again. Frank is also leaving Police Squad behind, as all movie cops have to retire somewhere in the story line. And some bad guy in jail (Ward) plans a break out, with Frank's help in the slammer undercover and metal-wrapped to avoid gay-sex in the showers. Ha ha ha ha ha ha and ha. No, I'm really not laughing at prison "dropping the soap" jokes. Literally  they went there. Anyways, the target is the Academy Awards for no other reason to blow up the place because this movie won't come close to winning any awards. Now that it appears I've completely bashed this movie, I will say there are a few funny moments: Jane's exit from Frank  really hilarious as were the fake movies and presentations at the Oscars. There were a few tiny, tiny moments sprinkled, but NOT ENOUGH for a recommendation. Seriously, this movie, despite some moderately funny moments, felt eerily spliced together and most as an afterthought. Even the Oscar fake movies, as humorous as they were, seemed rushed. This movie gets no endorsement from me, and thank goodness this would be the last  mark my words: I guarantee neither Leslie Nielsen or George Kennedy will anytime soon be appearing in a fourth movie, much less any feature length film. And you can forget about O.J. Simpson  who hilariously plays a dumb and distracted cop here  once he's released, he'll undoubtedly do something else incriminating.

    There are certain films that, on occasion, can escape almost any criticism and a fine spoof is one such occasion. The first two Naked Gun films are wonderful examples of the genre, filled with both visual gags and rapid one-liners that also remain funny after multiple viewings. Sadly, there can be too much of a good thing and this final entry into the series feels tired, strained and kinda desperate. Spoof stalwart Leslie Nielsen returns for the last time as Frank Drebin, Police Squad's most decorated officer who is retiring to spend time with his new wife Jane (Priscilla Presley). But Drebin can't ignore the threat of crime for long and after working undercover on behalf of his old buddies Ed Hocken (George Kennedy) and Nordberg (O.J. Simpson), Frank soon finds himself back in the fold and pitching his wits against determined bomber Rocco (Fred Ward) who is planning to blow up a critical target after he escapes from prison. Can Frank get the job done, even with the voluptuous distraction of Rocco's moll Tanya (Anne Nicole Smith)? The thing with all Naked Gun movies is to not take it seriously and "The Naked Gun 33 ⅓: The Final Insult" is no exception. It's as daft and stupid as peeing on an electric fence but sadly, the humour isn't quite as successful this time around. There is some noticeable repetition of gags - not just from the earlier movies but also from "Police Squad", the TV show that spawned this franchise - and some of the visual gags felt a little lame. Thank God Nielsen is still on form, perfectly cast as the straight-faced idiot working in his own little world with its own little logic. The rest of the cast simply work alongside him but some seem distracted almost - Smith has little to do besides pout and squeeze into some lingerie while Kathleen Freeman, as the matriarch of Rocco's gang, feels a little wasted. But despite the flaws and rough edges, there is still a good deal to laugh at and much to savour, as if you're watching aging rockers having one last hurrah before splitting up for good. The magic might have faded a little, the lines in the face are a bit more ragged and the tunes may sound a bit familiar but who cares if you're still having fun? It simply isn't as funny as the two earlier films - that is just the facts - but you can't knock it for lack of effort. But a much-reduced running time and a recycling of old ideas means that The Final Insult feels more like an epilogue instead of a glorious last chapter.

    Look, I'm just not going to spend too much time on this (mostly) piece of crap. Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult suffers many defeats, probably the first/foremost: The absence of the original ZAZ (Jim Abrahams, David & Jerry Zucker) creators who brought you the masterpiece Airplane!, the way above average The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! and the mostly funny Top Secret! Them, like the police chief in the first two Naked Gun's knew well enough to distance themselves. Sure, it defeats some comedy disasters: unbelievably, it gets better as the movie progresses. How much better? Well, start on the absolute cutting room floor and work your way up a few inches. So, there were a few, I'll admit, funny segments in the 2nd half to finale, but most fell flat. Such as "Where's Waldo"  REALLY?!?  and an actual "Beavis and Butt-Head" tribute? Gimme a break. I failed to mention to amount of homophobia in the previous two chapters. This one tops the other two threefold. Yeah, I get one was mocking The Crying Game  duh, but it's still not a pleasant thing to see, when it's this vicious and not simply funny. I'll quickly skim the plot: Jane (Presley) and Frank (Nielsen) are fighting and leaving each other..again. Frank is also leaving Police Squad behind, as all movie cops have to retire somewhere in the story line. And some bad guy in jail (Ward) plans a break out, with Frank's help in the slammer undercover and metal-wrapped to avoid gay-sex in the showers. Ha ha ha ha ha ha and ha. No, I'm really not laughing at prison "dropping the soap" jokes. Literally  they went there. Anyways, the target is the Academy Awards for no other reason to blow up the place because this movie won't come close to winning any awards. Now that it appears I've completely bashed this movie, I will say there are a few funny moments: Jane's exit from Frank  really hilarious as were the fake movies and presentations at the Oscars. There were a few tiny, tiny moments sprinkled, but NOT ENOUGH for a recommendation. Seriously, this movie, despite some moderately funny moments, felt eerily spliced together and most as an afterthought. Even the Oscar fake movies, as humorous as they were, seemed rushed. This movie gets no endorsement from me, and thank goodness this would be the last  mark my words: I guarantee neither Leslie Nielsen or George Kennedy will anytime soon be appearing in a fourth movie, much less any feature length film. And you can forget about O.J. Simpson  who hilariously plays a dumb and distracted cop here  once he's released, he'll undoubtedly do something else incriminating.

    There are certain films that, on occasion, can escape almost any criticism and a fine spoof is one such occasion. The first two Naked Gun films are wonderful examples of the genre, filled with both visual gags and rapid one-liners that also remain funny after multiple viewings. Sadly, there can be too much of a good thing and this final entry into the series feels tired, strained and kinda desperate. Spoof stalwart Leslie Nielsen returns for the last time as Frank Drebin, Police Squad's most decorated officer who is retiring to spend time with his new wife Jane (Priscilla Presley). But Drebin can't ignore the threat of crime for long and after working undercover on behalf of his old buddies Ed Hocken (George Kennedy) and Nordberg (O.J. Simpson), Frank soon finds himself back in the fold and pitching his wits against determined bomber Rocco (Fred Ward) who is planning to blow up a critical target after he escapes from prison. Can Frank get the job done, even with the voluptuous distraction of Rocco's moll Tanya (Anne Nicole Smith)? The thing with all Naked Gun movies is to not take it seriously and "The Naked Gun 33 ⅓: The Final Insult" is no exception. It's as daft and stupid as peeing on an electric fence but sadly, the humour isn't quite as successful this time around. There is some noticeable repetition of gags - not just from the earlier movies but also from "Police Squad", the TV show that spawned this franchise - and some of the visual gags felt a little lame. Thank God Nielsen is still on form, perfectly cast as the straight-faced idiot working in his own little world with its own little logic. The rest of the cast simply work alongside him but some seem distracted almost - Smith has little to do besides pout and squeeze into some lingerie while Kathleen Freeman, as the matriarch of Rocco's gang, feels a little wasted. But despite the flaws and rough edges, there is still a good deal to laugh at and much to savour, as if you're watching aging rockers having one last hurrah before splitting up for good. The magic might have faded a little, the lines in the face are a bit more ragged and the tunes may sound a bit familiar but who cares if you're still having fun? It simply isn't as funny as the two earlier films - that is just the facts - but you can't knock it for lack of effort. But a much-reduced running time and a recycling of old ideas means that The Final Insult feels more like an epilogue instead of a glorious last chapter.

    Unlike the first Naked gun movie, produced in 1988, (Jim Abrahams) and (Jerry Zucker) weren't part of the writing this round, leaving (Pat Proft) and (David Zucker) alone in preparation of going solo afterwards. I felt that that left its bad mark here, where the movie was all about 2 acts only : getting to the bomb expert, then that expert's job at the Oscars ! Speaking about problems; true that the atmosphere was dynamically ironic, but the cast somewhat wasn't as dynamic. For instance (Leslie Nielson) seemed less energetic with obviously sick voice for most of the time, (George Kennedy) was almost having a paralysis. Not to mention the absence of many cameos, especially with the idea of parodying the Oscar night. Aside from the charming flavor of having these stars on screen, their presence assures the movie's conscience as a parody for flaws everybody admits. Away from that; there were many clever scenes (the parody of The Untouchables, the scene of the wife leaving the house..), and many clever lines (I used to be white ! / Yeah, I remember the Osmonds !). It reached the top during the Oscar night sequence, which is a classic act I can't get enough of despite numerous times of watching. Knowing that I write this in 2012, you must notice that the direction was smart and vivid. The pace was fine, without dragging on with one sequence pointlessly. How creative before how funny the laughs were, since they didn't incline totally to for instance the toilet humor, the fart jokes. And, most importantly, look at things like the characters' problems and solutions; the lead's wife wants to have a baby, but he has no capacity since leaving the police force, therefore his return will provide finally the self-respect he lost and needs. OH MY GOD. Back then, making a parody didn't mean being an idiot as a director or writer yet! Watch all of (Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer) recent spoofs to understand that better, and to cherish this movie, along with its era, more and more. It's an entertaining comedy, but more short and less full than its 2 antecedents. It marks the start of the end of the parody movie's golden age; the age which began with (Airplane!  1980) by (Jim Abrahams), (Jerry Zucker), (David Zucker) and (Pat Proft) "who had special thanks credit in that movie". One of the end's reasons is the breakup of that golden team. After the departure of (Jim Abrahams) and (Jerry Zucker), (Pat Proft) and (David Zucker) would go to play solo as well. Sorrowfully not a good thing for them, or us, as it turned out to be. Because next movies like Jane Austen's Mafia!, BASEketball, Wrongfully Accused, and Scary Movie 3 don't stand comparison to the insanity, precision, and movie culture of one Naked Gun movie. P.S : the Arab is always a terrorist in Hollywood movies ?? It's almost like how the Afro-American was always a servant in old Hollywood movies ! While that attitude became old itself, why the Arab status doesn't get old at all ?!

    Frank has retired, and is essentially a housewife, a whole new field where he can be incompetent. Jane continues working and now wants a baby, and the two aren't... having relations. He's called back to duty for one last mission(have you heard that one before?). The most prolific terrorist bomber in the US, Rocco(Fred Ward, a badass as usual... and just wait 'till you meet his mother, played by Kathleen Freeman!) may be planning his biggest score, so Drebin has to go undercover as a criminal, meeting up with him in jail. We have some fun with him trying to pass as such, and the new setting and situation are very welcome, since the first two followed essentially the same formula of solving a case. The main cast return and do well, and the new blood are great as well... then again, perhaps Anna Nicole Smith is a tad flat(...sorry) in her delivery, though she does give it her all when mugging. This does have several gags and jokes that just fail, and it was smart to end the series here(and don't get me wrong, it's an appropriate final chapter). The style of humor is the same as the others, with sometimes only a single element "off" in a scene and everyone reacts in a realistic manner and the laws of physics behave as they should, telegraphing the punchline, etc. Like the others, this has aged surprisingly well. There is some direct sexual stuff, albeit no nudity, and a little mild language, in this. I recommend this to any fan of spoofs and/or action/crime thrillers with tough, no-nonsense cops. 6/10

    Successful movie franchises usually tend to start of with a bang, only to slowly fade out like a candle with every new installment. "Naked Gun" however, it just kept getting better and better. The original was funny, so was 2 1/2, but to me 33 1/3 is really the one that never gets old. So many classic Leslie Nielsen scenes in this one, so many great quotes. The structure (or lack thereof) is similar to that of the first two, but the finale at the Oscars is by far my favorite of the three. The movie's also tightly paced, it doesn't go on for any longer than it needs to. It's not that the others are boring, but there's still a noticeable difference. Many disagree with this, but to me "The Final Insult" will always be Leslie Nielsen at his absolute peak. He has his character down to a tee here, too bad he didn't get better scripts in his later days. But oh well, I can always watch this one again.

    'Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult', the third and final film in the Naked Gun series, is a hilarious slapstick fare, where it's lead star, the late Hollywood Legend, Leslie Nielsen, proves once again, that he is an unstoppable/unforgettable talent. 'Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult' Synopsis: Frank Drebin comes out of retirement to help Police Squad infiltrate a gang of terrorists planning to detonate a bomb at the Academy Awards. 'Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult' is a faithful & satisfying sequel. It raises a lot of laughs, especially in the climax, the entire Academy-Awards Sequence, which is absolutely hilarious. Pat Proft, David Zucker & Robert LoCash's Screenplay is genuinely funny & extremely arresting. Peter Segal Directs this slapstick comedy, decently. Cinematography & Art Design, are worth a mention. Performance Wise: Nielsen, as mentioned before, is unstoppable in here. The legendary actor delivers a laugh-out-loud performance, and holds the film from start to end. Priscilla Presley supports well. George Kennedy is excellent. O.J. Simpson is fair. Fred Ward & Kathleen Freeman are passable. Others lend support. On the whole, 'Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult' is slapstick comedy at its best.

    The first film is a classic, the second while inferior is very enjoyable and this one is also very funny if for me the weakest of the series. It could have been longer, and there are moments in the movie where it does rely a little too much on the jokes and slapstick of the previous two. However, the dialogue is endearingly dumb and silly still, and the film is filled with gags and most work, the best for me being Frank's antics during Zadora's musical number and Frank wreaking havoc at the Oscars. The story is fast-paced and fun, the production values are of good quality, Priscilla Presley is strong support and there are some neat cameos from Pia Zadora and Fred Ward. And once again, Leslie Nielson is wonderfully deadpan. All in all, a very funny movie. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult is a hilarious movie with a decent storyline and yet again another brilliant and comedic performance from Leslie Nielsen as Frank Drebin.Its definitely not as good as the outstanding first Naked Gun,one of the funniest comedies ever made in my opinion,but I thought it was an improvement from the first Naked Gun,I thought there was a lot more hilarious scenes in this one and I really enjoyed the scenes at the Academy Awards towards the end of the movie.Some people may disagree,but I think this Naked Gun is an improvement over the second one and fans of the first won't enjoy it as much,but they will laugh a lot. Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen) must convince a gang that he is also a criminal in order to stop a bomb from being set off at the Academy Awards.

    The third installment in the series has Lt. Drebin retiring from the force, only to return to apprehend a terrorist. It's a case of diminishing returns, as the gags become more forced and the jokes become staler with each entry. Nielsen seems to be having a ball, as he reprises for the final time the role that showcased a flair for comedy that had been hidden through most of his career. It starts with a funny spoof of the train station steps sequence from "The Untouchables," which in turn was an homage to "Potemkin." Much of what comes after that is quite lame. Things do pick up towards the end as the action shifts to the Academy Awards, and a number of has-beens and B-listers gamely make cameo appearances as themselves.

    Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen) comes out of retirement to help Police Squad infiltrate a gang of terrorists planning to detonate a bomb at the Academy Awards. An excellent spoof on police and prison movies... with plenty of visual gags, quirky remarks (like the midget at the urinal). If you did not think that OJ Simpson was a funny guy, you need to see him in this role... wow, such a great actor! What can I say? Just a good, fun comedy... so sad we have lost Nielsen and Anna Nicole Smith... and OJ Simpson, sort of. At least we still have Mary Lou Retton, I guess.

    The first film is a classic, the second while inferior is very enjoyable and this one is also very funny if for me the weakest of the series. It could have been longer, and there are moments in the movie where it does rely a little too much on the jokes and slapstick of the previous two. However, the dialogue is endearingly dumb and silly still, and the film is filled with gags and most work, the best for me being Frank's antics during Zadora's musical number and Frank wreaking havoc at the Oscars. The story is fast-paced and fun, the production values are of good quality, Priscilla Presley is strong support and there are some neat cameos from Pia Zadora and Fred Ward. And once again, Leslie Nielson is wonderfully deadpan. All in all, a very funny movie. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult is a hilarious movie with a decent storyline and yet again another brilliant and comedic performance from Leslie Nielsen as Frank Drebin.Its definitely not as good as the outstanding first Naked Gun,one of the funniest comedies ever made in my opinion,but I thought it was an improvement from the first Naked Gun,I thought there was a lot more hilarious scenes in this one and I really enjoyed the scenes at the Academy Awards towards the end of the movie.Some people may disagree,but I think this Naked Gun is an improvement over the second one and fans of the first won't enjoy it as much,but they will laugh a lot. Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen) must convince a gang that he is also a criminal in order to stop a bomb from being set off at the Academy Awards.

    The third installment in the series has Lt. Drebin retiring from the force, only to return to apprehend a terrorist. It's a case of diminishing returns, as the gags become more forced and the jokes become staler with each entry. Nielsen seems to be having a ball, as he reprises for the final time the role that showcased a flair for comedy that had been hidden through most of his career. It starts with a funny spoof of the train station steps sequence from "The Untouchables," which in turn was an homage to "Potemkin." Much of what comes after that is quite lame. Things do pick up towards the end as the action shifts to the Academy Awards, and a number of has-beens and B-listers gamely make cameo appearances as themselves.

    Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen) comes out of retirement to help Police Squad infiltrate a gang of terrorists planning to detonate a bomb at the Academy Awards. An excellent spoof on police and prison movies... with plenty of visual gags, quirky remarks (like the midget at the urinal). If you did not think that OJ Simpson was a funny guy, you need to see him in this role... wow, such a great actor! What can I say? Just a good, fun comedy... so sad we have lost Nielsen and Anna Nicole Smith... and OJ Simpson, sort of. At least we still have Mary Lou Retton, I guess.

    Look, I'm just not going to spend too much time on this (mostly) piece of crap. Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult suffers many defeats, probably the first/foremost: The absence of the original ZAZ (Jim Abrahams, David & Jerry Zucker) creators who brought you the masterpiece Airplane!, the way above average The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! and the mostly funny Top Secret! Them, like the police chief in the first two Naked Gun's knew well enough to distance themselves. Sure, it defeats some comedy disasters: unbelievably, it gets better as the movie progresses. How much better? Well, start on the absolute cutting room floor and work your way up a few inches. So, there were a few, I'll admit, funny segments in the 2nd half to finale, but most fell flat. Such as "Where's Waldo"  REALLY?!?  and an actual "Beavis and Butt-Head" tribute? Gimme a break. I failed to mention to amount of homophobia in the previous two chapters. This one tops the other two threefold. Yeah, I get one was mocking The Crying Game  duh, but it's still not a pleasant thing to see, when it's this vicious and not simply funny. I'll quickly skim the plot: Jane (Presley) and Frank (Nielsen) are fighting and leaving each other..again. Frank is also leaving Police Squad behind, as all movie cops have to retire somewhere in the story line. And some bad guy in jail (Ward) plans a break out, with Frank's help in the slammer undercover and metal-wrapped to avoid gay-sex in the showers. Ha ha ha ha ha ha and ha. No, I'm really not laughing at prison "dropping the soap" jokes. Literally  they went there. Anyways, the target is the Academy Awards for no other reason to blow up the place because this movie won't come close to winning any awards. Now that it appears I've completely bashed this movie, I will say there are a few funny moments: Jane's exit from Frank  really hilarious as were the fake movies and presentations at the Oscars. There were a few tiny, tiny moments sprinkled, but NOT ENOUGH for a recommendation. Seriously, this movie, despite some moderately funny moments, felt eerily spliced together and most as an afterthought. Even the Oscar fake movies, as humorous as they were, seemed rushed. This movie gets no endorsement from me, and thank goodness this would be the last  mark my words: I guarantee neither Leslie Nielsen or George Kennedy will anytime soon be appearing in a fourth movie, much less any feature length film. And you can forget about O.J. Simpson  who hilariously plays a dumb and distracted cop here  once he's released, he'll undoubtedly do something else incriminating.

    There are certain films that, on occasion, can escape almost any criticism and a fine spoof is one such occasion. The first two Naked Gun films are wonderful examples of the genre, filled with both visual gags and rapid one-liners that also remain funny after multiple viewings. Sadly, there can be too much of a good thing and this final entry into the series feels tired, strained and kinda desperate. Spoof stalwart Leslie Nielsen returns for the last time as Frank Drebin, Police Squad's most decorated officer who is retiring to spend time with his new wife Jane (Priscilla Presley). But Drebin can't ignore the threat of crime for long and after working undercover on behalf of his old buddies Ed Hocken (George Kennedy) and Nordberg (O.J. Simpson), Frank soon finds himself back in the fold and pitching his wits against determined bomber Rocco (Fred Ward) who is planning to blow up a critical target after he escapes from prison. Can Frank get the job done, even with the voluptuous distraction of Rocco's moll Tanya (Anne Nicole Smith)? The thing with all Naked Gun movies is to not take it seriously and "The Naked Gun 33 ⅓: The Final Insult" is no exception. It's as daft and stupid as peeing on an electric fence but sadly, the humour isn't quite as successful this time around. There is some noticeable repetition of gags - not just from the earlier movies but also from "Police Squad", the TV show that spawned this franchise - and some of the visual gags felt a little lame. Thank God Nielsen is still on form, perfectly cast as the straight-faced idiot working in his own little world with its own little logic. The rest of the cast simply work alongside him but some seem distracted almost - Smith has little to do besides pout and squeeze into some lingerie while Kathleen Freeman, as the matriarch of Rocco's gang, feels a little wasted. But despite the flaws and rough edges, there is still a good deal to laugh at and much to savour, as if you're watching aging rockers having one last hurrah before splitting up for good. The magic might have faded a little, the lines in the face are a bit more ragged and the tunes may sound a bit familiar but who cares if you're still having fun? It simply isn't as funny as the two earlier films - that is just the facts - but you can't knock it for lack of effort. But a much-reduced running time and a recycling of old ideas means that The Final Insult feels more like an epilogue instead of a glorious last chapter.

    Unlike the first Naked gun movie, produced in 1988, (Jim Abrahams) and (Jerry Zucker) weren't part of the writing this round, leaving (Pat Proft) and (David Zucker) alone in preparation of going solo afterwards. I felt that that left its bad mark here, where the movie was all about 2 acts only : getting to the bomb expert, then that expert's job at the Oscars ! Speaking about problems; true that the atmosphere was dynamically ironic, but the cast somewhat wasn't as dynamic. For instance (Leslie Nielson) seemed less energetic with obviously sick voice for most of the time, (George Kennedy) was almost having a paralysis. Not to mention the absence of many cameos, especially with the idea of parodying the Oscar night. Aside from the charming flavor of having these stars on screen, their presence assures the movie's conscience as a parody for flaws everybody admits. Away from that; there were many clever scenes (the parody of The Untouchables, the scene of the wife leaving the house..), and many clever lines (I used to be white ! / Yeah, I remember the Osmonds !). It reached the top during the Oscar night sequence, which is a classic act I can't get enough of despite numerous times of watching. Knowing that I write this in 2012, you must notice that the direction was smart and vivid. The pace was fine, without dragging on with one sequence pointlessly. How creative before how funny the laughs were, since they didn't incline totally to for instance the toilet humor, the fart jokes. And, most importantly, look at things like the characters' problems and solutions; the lead's wife wants to have a baby, but he has no capacity since leaving the police force, therefore his return will provide finally the self-respect he lost and needs. OH MY GOD. Back then, making a parody didn't mean being an idiot as a director or writer yet! Watch all of (Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer) recent spoofs to understand that better, and to cherish this movie, along with its era, more and more. It's an entertaining comedy, but more short and less full than its 2 antecedents. It marks the start of the end of the parody movie's golden age; the age which began with (Airplane!  1980) by (Jim Abrahams), (Jerry Zucker), (David Zucker) and (Pat Proft) "who had special thanks credit in that movie". One of the end's reasons is the breakup of that golden team. After the departure of (Jim Abrahams) and (Jerry Zucker), (Pat Proft) and (David Zucker) would go to play solo as well. Sorrowfully not a good thing for them, or us, as it turned out to be. Because next movies like Jane Austen's Mafia!, BASEketball, Wrongfully Accused, and Scary Movie 3 don't stand comparison to the insanity, precision, and movie culture of one Naked Gun movie. P.S : the Arab is always a terrorist in Hollywood movies ?? It's almost like how the Afro-American was always a servant in old Hollywood movies ! While that attitude became old itself, why the Arab status doesn't get old at all ?!

    Frank has retired, and is essentially a housewife, a whole new field where he can be incompetent. Jane continues working and now wants a baby, and the two aren't... having relations. He's called back to duty for one last mission(have you heard that one before?). The most prolific terrorist bomber in the US, Rocco(Fred Ward, a badass as usual... and just wait 'till you meet his mother, played by Kathleen Freeman!) may be planning his biggest score, so Drebin has to go undercover as a criminal, meeting up with him in jail. We have some fun with him trying to pass as such, and the new setting and situation are very welcome, since the first two followed essentially the same formula of solving a case. The main cast return and do well, and the new blood are great as well... then again, perhaps Anna Nicole Smith is a tad flat(...sorry) in her delivery, though she does give it her all when mugging. This does have several gags and jokes that just fail, and it was smart to end the series here(and don't get me wrong, it's an appropriate final chapter). The style of humor is the same as the others, with sometimes only a single element "off" in a scene and everyone reacts in a realistic manner and the laws of physics behave as they should, telegraphing the punchline, etc. Like the others, this has aged surprisingly well. There is some direct sexual stuff, albeit no nudity, and a little mild language, in this. I recommend this to any fan of spoofs and/or action/crime thrillers with tough, no-nonsense cops. 6/10

    Successful movie franchises usually tend to start of with a bang, only to slowly fade out like a candle with every new installment. "Naked Gun" however, it just kept getting better and better. The original was funny, so was 2 1/2, but to me 33 1/3 is really the one that never gets old. So many classic Leslie Nielsen scenes in this one, so many great quotes. The structure (or lack thereof) is similar to that of the first two, but the finale at the Oscars is by far my favorite of the three. The movie's also tightly paced, it doesn't go on for any longer than it needs to. It's not that the others are boring, but there's still a noticeable difference. Many disagree with this, but to me "The Final Insult" will always be Leslie Nielsen at his absolute peak. He has his character down to a tee here, too bad he didn't get better scripts in his later days. But oh well, I can always watch this one again.

    'Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult', the third and final film in the Naked Gun series, is a hilarious slapstick fare, where it's lead star, the late Hollywood Legend, Leslie Nielsen, proves once again, that he is an unstoppable/unforgettable talent. 'Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult' Synopsis: Frank Drebin comes out of retirement to help Police Squad infiltrate a gang of terrorists planning to detonate a bomb at the Academy Awards. 'Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult' is a faithful & satisfying sequel. It raises a lot of laughs, especially in the climax, the entire Academy-Awards Sequence, which is absolutely hilarious. Pat Proft, David Zucker & Robert LoCash's Screenplay is genuinely funny & extremely arresting. Peter Segal Directs this slapstick comedy, decently. Cinematography & Art Design, are worth a mention. Performance Wise: Nielsen, as mentioned before, is unstoppable in here. The legendary actor delivers a laugh-out-loud performance, and holds the film from start to end. Priscilla Presley supports well. George Kennedy is excellent. O.J. Simpson is fair. Fred Ward & Kathleen Freeman are passable. Others lend support. On the whole, 'Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult' is slapstick comedy at its best.
