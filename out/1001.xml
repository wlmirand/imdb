    I don't know why this has such a low score on IMDb, and i don't know why I've never seen it before. I by chance started watching it today, and I've been in tears laughing my butt off all day long watching it. This movie is basically non-stop hilarious idiotic one-liners and absurd vaudeville comedy like scenes. It's very reminiscent of the comedy style of Airplane and all its sequels and the deadpan absurdity of Leslie Nielsen. And it doesn't slow down at all, it actually gets funnier and funnier. I guess this type of comedy isn't everyone's cup of tea, but if you liked Airplane, you'll love The Stupids. I gave it a 9 'cause it's just, that, stupid.

    The highlight of this embarrassment of contemporary American cinema was the ending credits. I'd prefer to sit through a torture experience worse than Daniel Craig endured in his first bond movie than suffer through an hour and a half of "The Stupids". I'd much rather have my balls tied to a doorknob and slammed hard against that god forsaken wall than have to suffer through this tragic joke of a movie. Whoever directed this movie needs to be ostracized from his profession and exiled in a small shack in Puerto Rico never to have anything to do with the arts again. The fact is was offered on direct TV boggles my mind. Drives me crazy. It should made illegal to even speak of the title. I suppose there is one bright side of "The Stupids". It exemplifies how not to make a good movie, rather a horrifically tragic movie.

    I haven't read a single other review of this film. That is next on my list of things to do. But I will say that this silly movie in uncannily funny. The credit goes equally to the four principal characters. If you like this movie it will be because you can appreciate when great actors can make the most trite comic premise work. The movies is simply about a middle class family whose every member is dumber than a dog. They are on a quest to find out who steals their garbage regularly (sanitation engineers of course) and from there it proceeds and succeeds. For example my favorite bit is when Tom Arnold reenters his car from the passenger side and concludes that he can no longer drive the car as the ignition and steering wheel are no longer in his direct line of sight ( or something like that). Honestly, this thing is funny and Tom Arnold is a funny guy.

    I took my son to see this with every intention of watching a completely goofy movie since we love other titles such as The Jerk, Airplane, etc. However, we couldn't sit through more than ten minutes before getting up and leaving the theater, fore-fitting our admission cost and all. It was just TOO stupid, so stupid that my brain was starting to hurt. So, despite the fact that 10 minutes isn't enough to give it a fair assessment, I think leaving a moving after only 10 minutes is a testimony of its own. I may see if I can find this on Netflix to see if my 15 year old memories of it are still accurate. And it may be worth the time to get some Mystery Science Theater style entertainment out of this train-wreck.

    Seriously, this movie is full of incredibly unfunny jokes that makes this one "stupid" movie (the movie is worse than that pun right there). Yes it is horrible, don't watch it, don't waste any money on it. The only people that could find this humorous are 5 year old children, in no way should this be funny to anyone who's age is above that. It IS the worst movie ever produced. The movie is not witty, it's jokes are... ugh, actually no, they aren't jokes, in fact, I don't know what they are. I just don't have the words to describe how terrible this movie is. Once again, I will reiterate: Don't watch it and don't waste money on it.

    Utter, complete, total garbage! STAY AWAY PLEASE! I am lost for words to describe just how belittling and patronizing this is. I've noticed that one reviewer commented on the "classic" scenes such as 'I'm My Own Grandpa' or something like that...well I just saw this supposed masterpiece of a scene and it is pathetic. I can understand that this movie is being deliberately stupid but that is exactly what bugs me. The acting and the supposed funny moments are clearly fake, predictable, overacted, clich&eacute;d and not funny. Dumb & Dumber for instance was also about two abnormally stupid guys but there was a sense that the movie allowed for you to pick up the stupid moments-and yes, while they weren't hard to pick up at least it wasn't in-your-face-turn-at-the-camera-and-over-emphasize-the words type of moments. Furthermore, in Dumb & Dumber while the two main characters were stupid, nobody else in the movie was. Here, EVERYBODY in the movie is as stupid, dim and dense as the main 'characters'. And at least D&D had a degree of realism in that as stupid as the main characters were, their low-life lifestyle matched them. Here, the Stupids are a well-off family yet utterly useless! I realize I may be babbling but movies like this irritate because I fail to see why people bother making them and in so doing insult moviegoers to such a degree. There's no no pint in "taking intelligence out of the equation" as one reviewer noted because if a movie can be funny and entertaining with a degree of intelligence in it, why should you take intelligence out of this movie? Is it because the makers had none themselves and were too lazy to put in an effort with this movie? It's a crime to call this a comedy or a movie. The animated pets and aliens at the end utterly made me lose the plot! I only watched about 20min and I was left irritated for days. It is annoying and a waste of time...you'd have a better time listening to your plants grow.

    This movie provides the answer to the age-old question I know some of you have asked yourselves at least once, "How can someone be so stupid and still remain living?" If you're going to enjoy this movie, you have to be a willing co-conspirator, able to reserve judgement. You have to meet this movie on it's own level, not expect it to come to you. Like a play instead of a modern, 'ran through tons of focus groups', Hollywood flick. If you go in feeling lots of skepticism or feel like your 'inner film-critic' wants to watch the movie with you for live analysis, then go see "The Piano". If you want to see an absurd spectacle made of the "modern" nuclear family, with a subversive glint, and a Hollywood (low)budget, perhaps to almost suffocate from laughter, then watch 'The Stupids'. Stanley was a role Tom Arnold was born to play. OK, first understand that this movie isn't played like your average American 'popular comedy' movie.(As evidenced by it's poor box office showing.) The characters come from a series of children's books that gained a global underground following after a number of Family Values Groups tried to get it banned in the US. So that sets the stage for me for what they were actually trying to do with this movie, and I love the hell of out it. The director and the writers and heck, even the underwriters really had some balls to put this movie out like they did. A real gamble to make "a bad movie, well done", totally on purpose. None of the characters are social archetypes that are 'too cool for school', they're not going to bank on pop culture references or nostalgia, they don't expect you to relate to what you're seeing or sympathize with the characters. I don't want to say Brechtian, but it's definitely old-school theatre style. Everything is done for the pure purpose of hilarious spectacle, to make the viewer question both what they're seeing, and their sanity. When Mrs. Stupid comes out wearing that camouflage dress she made out of wigs, I knew I had lost it. You won't see that anywhere else, played straight like it was, like, "there's mom, in a ghillie suit made of wigs.", in perfect context, and almost making sense? You either take this movie at face value, and run the risk of some of the best parts flying over your head, or you can understand that this movie plays on a totally different level. It's very aggressive with it's delivery of gags, then ignores the gag part totally, and then to see how everything nests into everything else so subtly, you almost wonder if the Stupid family are actually of some kind of mad genius savants. They definitely live in a different reality than we do, and the joke of the film is that it actually all works, in a way that isn't forced. See it. Get it from the DVD bargain bin. This film deserves a shot to make you laugh.

    When I first saw this movie I was about 14 years old and nearly died laughing. Ten years later years I still burst my sides from this witty film. Now I'm not big on Tom Arnold as an actor but he definitely makes the perfect Stanley Stupid. Besides from a few cheezy parts like the very poorly computer animated pet dog & cat this movie is pure conspiracy theory comedic genius. There are so many hilarious jokes that somehow move the plot along... 8 wheels beats 4 wheels, 10-1-1 over 9-1-1, the Lloyd, "Man-Bush" come on people! I can't believe anyone could actually consider this one of this worst movies ever made. Go ahead and spend another 5 bucks & purchase the film (buying it new might be cheaper than renting it), get over the PG rating and laugh your @$*%! off at this hilarious comedy!!

    This is probably the only film I've seen where the IMDb reviews on both sides of the spectrum are 100% accurate. "The Stupids" is an atrocious, dim-witted film with absolutely no artistic merit whatsoever, and is a denigration to a director like John Landis. And that's what makes it great. In order to appreciate "The Stupids", you have to keep in mind a little-known, but very true maxim spoken by director Abo Kyrou: "I urge you to learn to look at bad films, they are so often sublime." In order for any film to work, the film must establish and follow it's own logic, and if it does so convincingly and sincerely, then it's actually possible for the film to work. For example, when you watch "Freddy Got Fingered" as a traditional gross-out comedy, it's complete and utter garbage; when you watch it with the understanding that it's actually a neo-surrealist comedy, it's brilliant. It works with good movies too. If "Jaws" hadn't accepted the reality it created, the air-tank explosion ending wouldn't have worked. But, a lot of people think "Jaws" is vastly overrated for this type of reason, and they aren't wrong. But it has it's strengths, doesn't it? The point being that a movie like this makes sense if you look at it with the right perspective. Some people, like me, get it right away, while others never will no matter how often it's explained. Jim Jarmusch made a compelling defense of "Showgirls" once, and even afterwards I still can't see it from his P.O.V. Doesn't mean he's wrong though. If you have the right frame of mind when you watch this movie (and NO I DO NOT MEAN STONED, I'm gonna put that to bed right now), you can actually enjoy the movie for the dumb, cheap, pointless slapstick late-80s/early-90s-style farce that it is. The defenders and haters of this film are right: It's STUPID, and that's the point. The movie accepts the stupidity of the characters much in the same way "The Jerk" accepted Navin Johnson's idiocy. And because it takes that and runs with it, the movie focuses exclusively on using that to forward the plot and to define the characters. A "bad" movie would actually do this and fail to use that logic properly; bad movie are bad because they make it up as they go along, whereas movies like "The Stupids" knows where it's going, what it's doing and why from the beginning. I can't defend the film from an artistic standpoint, which is why I give it such a low rating. The acting is mostly bad, the jokes very superficial, and the live-action quality probably ruins what would have worked as a cartoon. But I can't deny that it IS entertaining in its own way, and that's why I defend it. I got it right away, and I pity those who don't. I'll admit I was drawn to this movie because of Christopher Lee's delicious cameo appearance (hearing him say "Release the drive bee!" would have been worth the rental price even if I hated this film), but was amazed to find that, aside from the TV Studio Applause Sign segment with Jenny McCarthy, I was never bored, and never disappointed. In fact, many of the jokes, because of their cartoonish context, were hilarious (in particular the airbag-cigarette explosion). They were dumb, but they were funny. And the movie doesn't pretend to be anything else: a STUPID comedy about STUPID characters and instead of apologizing for it, it enjoys itself. And that's exactly why it works.

    I absolutely find this movie to be very entertaining, funny, and full of great lines! Due to the mixed reviews and somewhat low ratings, I'd definitely consider this film to be a cult classic. Winning the Razzie Award for Worst Actor must have been a dream come true for Tom Arnold and he's sure at his best in this very movie! Possibly the best part in this movie is the song "I'm My Own Grandpaw", sung by Tom Arnold! The song is very nostalgic and funny! I don't care if this film wasn't well-received or if it grossed a reasonably small amount of money. I still love this movie, and for all those who are giving this film negative reviews, return your negative reviews to Sender! This film is one of the cult best!

    The highlight of this embarrassment of contemporary American cinema was the ending credits. I'd prefer to sit through a torture experience worse than Daniel Craig endured in his first bond movie than suffer through an hour and a half of "The Stupids". I'd much rather have my balls tied to a doorknob and slammed hard against that god forsaken wall than have to suffer through this tragic joke of a movie. Whoever directed this movie needs to be ostracized from his profession and exiled in a small shack in Puerto Rico never to have anything to do with the arts again. The fact is was offered on direct TV boggles my mind. Drives me crazy. It should made illegal to even speak of the title. I suppose there is one bright side of "The Stupids".

In order for any film to work, the film must establish and follow it's own logic, and if it does so convincingly and sincerely, then it's actually possible for the film to work. For example, when you watch "Freddy Got Fingered" as a traditional gross-out comedy, it's complete and utter garbage; when you watch it with the understanding that it's actually a neo-surrealist comedy, it's brilliant. It works with good movies too. If "Jaws" hadn't accepted the reality it created, the air-tank explosion ending wouldn't have worked. But, a lot of people think "Jaws" is vastly overrated for this type of reason, and they aren't wrong. But it has it's strengths, doesn't it? The point being that a movie like this makes sense if you look at it with the right perspective. Some people, like me, get it right away, while others never will no matter how often it's explained. Jim Jarmusch made a compelling defense of "Showgirls" once, and even afterwards I still can't see it from his P.O.V. Doesn't mean he's wrong though. If you have the right frame of mind when you watch this movie (and NO I DO NOT MEAN STONED, I'm gonna put that to bed right now), you can actually enjoy the movie for the dumb, cheap, pointless slapstick late-80s/early-90s-style farce that it is. The defenders and haters of this film are right: It's STUPID, and that's the point. The movie accepts the stupidity of the characters much in the same way "The Jerk" accepted Navin Johnson's idiocy. And because it takes that and runs with it, the movie focuses exclusively on using that to forward the plot and to define the characters. A "bad" movie would actually do this and fail to use that logic properly; bad movie are bad because they make it up as they go along, whereas movies like "The Stupids" knows where it's going, what it's doing and why from the beginning. I can't defend the film from an artistic standpoint, which is why I give it such a low rating. The acting is mostly bad, the jokes very superficial, and the live-action quality probably ruins what would have worked as a cartoon. But I can't deny that it IS entertaining in its own way, and that's why I defend it. I got it right away, and I pity those who don't. I'll admit I was drawn to this movie because of Christopher Lee's delicious cameo appearance (hearing him say "Release the drive bee!" would have been worth the rental price even if I hated this film), but was amazed to find that, aside from the TV Studio Applause Sign segment with Jenny McCarthy, I was never bored, and never disappointed. In fact, many of the jokes, because of their cartoonish context, were hilarious (in particular the airbag-cigarette explosion). They were dumb, but they were funny. And the movie doesn't pretend to be anything else: a STUPID comedy about STUPID characters and instead of apologizing for it, it enjoys itself. And that's exactly why it works.

    I absolutely find this movie to be very entertaining, funny, and full of great lines! Due to the mixed reviews and somewhat low ratings, I'd definitely consider this film to be a cult classic. Winning the Razzie Award for Worst Actor must have been a dream come true for Tom Arnold and he's sure at his best in this very movie! Possibly the best part in this movie is the song "I'm My Own Grandpaw", sung by Tom Arnold! The song is very nostalgic and funny! I don't care if this film wasn't well-received or if it grossed a reasonably small amount of money. I still love this movie, and for all those who are giving this film negative reviews, return your negative reviews to Sender! This film is one of the cult best!

    I don't know why this has such a low score on IMDb, and i don't know why I've never seen it before. I by chance started watching it today, and I've been in tears laughing my butt off all day long watching it. This movie is basically non-stop hilarious idiotic one-liners and absurd vaudeville comedy like scenes. It's very reminiscent of the comedy style of Airplane and all its sequels and the deadpan absurdity of Leslie Nielsen. And it doesn't slow down at all, it actually gets funnier and funnier. I guess this type of comedy isn't everyone's cup of tea, but if you liked Airplane, you'll love The Stupids. I gave it a 9 'cause it's just, that, stupid.

    The highlight of this embarrassment of contemporary American cinema was the ending credits. I'd prefer to sit through a torture experience worse than Daniel Craig endured in his first bond movie than suffer through an hour and a half of "The Stupids". I'd much rather have my balls tied to a doorknob and slammed hard against that god forsaken wall than have to suffer through this tragic joke of a movie. Whoever directed this movie needs to be ostracized from his profession and exiled in a small shack in Puerto Rico never to have anything to do with the arts again. The fact is was offered on direct TV boggles my mind. Drives me crazy. It should made illegal to even speak of the title. I suppose there is one bright side of "The Stupids". It exemplifies how not to make a good movie, rather a horrifically tragic movie.

    I haven't read a single other review of this film. That is next on my list of things to do. But I will say that this silly movie in uncannily funny. The credit goes equally to the four principal characters. If you like this movie it will be because you can appreciate when great actors can make the most trite comic premise work. The movies is simply about a middle class family whose every member is dumber than a dog. They are on a quest to find out who steals their garbage regularly (sanitation engineers of course) and from there it proceeds and succeeds. For example my favorite bit is when Tom Arnold reenters his car from the passenger side and concludes that he can no longer drive the car as the ignition and steering wheel are no longer in his direct line of sight ( or something like that). Honestly, this thing is funny and Tom Arnold is a funny guy.

    I took my son to see this with every intention of watching a completely goofy movie since we love other titles such as The Jerk, Airplane, etc. However, we couldn't sit through more than ten minutes before getting up and leaving the theater, fore-fitting our admission cost and all. It was just TOO stupid, so stupid that my brain was starting to hurt. So, despite the fact that 10 minutes isn't enough to give it a fair assessment, I think leaving a moving after only 10 minutes is a testimony of its own. I may see if I can find this on Netflix to see if my 15 year old memories of it are still accurate. And it may be worth the time to get some Mystery Science Theater style entertainment out of this train-wreck.

    Seriously, this movie is full of incredibly unfunny jokes that makes this one "stupid" movie (the movie is worse than that pun right there). Yes it is horrible, don't watch it, don't waste any money on it. The only people that could find this humorous are 5 year old children, in no way should this be funny to anyone who's age is above that. It IS the worst movie ever produced. The movie is not witty, it's jokes are... ugh, actually no, they aren't jokes, in fact, I don't know what they are. I just don't have the words to describe how terrible this movie is. Once again, I will reiterate: Don't watch it and don't waste money on it.

    Utter, complete, total garbage! STAY AWAY PLEASE! I am lost for words to describe just how belittling and patronizing this is. I've noticed that one reviewer commented on the "classic" scenes such as 'I'm My Own Grandpa' or something like that...well I just saw this supposed masterpiece of a scene and it is pathetic. I can understand that this movie is being deliberately stupid but that is exactly what bugs me. The acting and the supposed funny moments are clearly fake, predictable, overacted, clich&eacute;d and not funny. Dumb & Dumber for instance was also about two abnormally stupid guys but there was a sense that the movie allowed for you to pick up the stupid moments-and yes, while they weren't hard to pick up at least it wasn't in-your-face-turn-at-the-camera-and-over-emphasize-the words type of moments. Furthermore, in Dumb & Dumber while the two main characters were stupid, nobody else in the movie was. Here, EVERYBODY in the movie is as stupid, dim and dense as the main 'characters'. And at least D&D had a degree of realism in that as stupid as the main characters were, their low-life lifestyle matched them. Here, the Stupids are a well-off family yet utterly useless! I realize I may be babbling but movies like this irritate because I fail to see why people bother making them and in so doing insult moviegoers to such a degree. There's no no pint in "taking intelligence out of the equation" as one reviewer noted because if a movie can be funny and entertaining with a degree of intelligence in it, why should you take intelligence out of this movie? Is it because the makers had none themselves and were too lazy to put in an effort with this movie? It's a crime to call this a comedy or a movie. The animated pets and aliens at the end utterly made me lose the plot! I only watched about 20min and I was left irritated for days. It is annoying and a waste of time...you'd have a better time listening to your plants grow.

    This movie provides the answer to the age-old question I know some of you have asked yourselves at least once, "How can someone be so stupid and still remain living?" If you're going to enjoy this movie, you have to be a willing co-conspirator, able to reserve judgement. You have to meet this movie on it's own level, not expect it to come to you. Like a play instead of a modern, 'ran through tons of focus groups', Hollywood flick. If you go in feeling lots of skepticism or feel like your 'inner film-critic' wants to watch the movie with you for live analysis, then go see "The Piano". If you want to see an absurd spectacle made of the "modern" nuclear family, with a subversive glint, and a Hollywood (low)budget, perhaps to almost suffocate from laughter, then watch 'The Stupids'. Stanley was a role Tom Arnold was born to play. OK, first understand that this movie isn't played like your average American 'popular comedy' movie.(As evidenced by it's poor box office showing.) The characters come from a series of children's books that gained a global underground following after a number of Family Values Groups tried to get it banned in the US. So that sets the stage for me for what they were actually trying to do with this movie, and I love the hell of out it. The director and the writers and heck, even the underwriters really had some balls to put this movie out like they did. A real gamble to make "a bad movie, well done", totally on purpose. None of the characters are social archetypes that are 'too cool for school', they're not going to bank on pop culture references or nostalgia, they don't expect you to relate to what you're seeing or sympathize with the characters. I don't want to say Brechtian, but it's definitely old-school theatre style. Everything is done for the pure purpose of hilarious spectacle, to make the viewer question both what they're seeing, and their sanity. When Mrs. Stupid comes out wearing that camouflage dress she made out of wigs, I knew I had lost it. You won't see that anywhere else, played straight like it was, like, "there's mom, in a ghillie suit made of wigs.", in perfect context, and almost making sense? You either take this movie at face value, and run the risk of some of the best parts flying over your head, or you can understand that this movie plays on a totally different level. It's very aggressive with it's delivery of gags, then ignores the gag part totally, and then to see how everything nests into everything else so subtly, you almost wonder if the Stupid family are actually of some kind of mad genius savants. They definitely live in a different reality than we do, and the joke of the film is that it actually all works, in a way that isn't forced. See it. Get it from the DVD bargain bin. This film deserves a shot to make you laugh.

    When I first saw this movie I was about 14 years old and nearly died laughing. Ten years later years I still burst my sides from this witty film. Now I'm not big on Tom Arnold as an actor but he definitely makes the perfect Stanley Stupid. Besides from a few cheezy parts like the very poorly computer animated pet dog & cat this movie is pure conspiracy theory comedic genius. There are so many hilarious jokes that somehow move the plot along... 8 wheels beats 4 wheels, 10-1-1 over 9-1-1, the Lloyd, "Man-Bush" come on people! I can't believe anyone could actually consider this one of this worst movies ever made. Go ahead and spend another 5 bucks & purchase the film (buying it new might be cheaper than renting it), get over the PG rating and laugh your @$*%! off at this hilarious comedy!!

    This is probably the only film I've seen where the IMDb reviews on both sides of the spectrum are 100% accurate. "The Stupids" is an atrocious, dim-witted film with absolutely no artistic merit whatsoever, and is a denigration to a director like John Landis. And that's what makes it great. In order to appreciate "The Stupids", you have to keep in mind a little-known, but very true maxim spoken by director Abo Kyrou: "I urge you to learn to look at bad films, they are so often sublime." In order for any film to work, the film must establish and follow it's own logic, and if it does so convincingly and sincerely, then it's actually possible for the film to work. For example, when you watch "Freddy Got Fingered" as a traditional gross-out comedy, it's complete and utter garbage; when you watch it with the understanding that it's actually a neo-surrealist comedy, it's brilliant. It works with good movies too. If "Jaws" hadn't accepted the reality it created, the air-tank explosion ending wouldn't have worked. But, a lot of people think "Jaws" is vastly overrated for this type of reason, and they aren't wrong. But it has it's strengths, doesn't it? The point being that a movie like this makes sense if you look at it with the right perspective. Some people, like me, get it right away, while others never will no matter how often it's explained. Jim Jarmusch made a compelling defense of "Showgirls" once, and even afterwards I still can't see it from his P.O.V. Doesn't mean he's wrong though. If you have the right frame of mind when you watch this movie (and NO I DO NOT MEAN STONED, I'm gonna put that to bed right now), you can actually enjoy the movie for the dumb, cheap, pointless slapstick late-80s/early-90s-style farce that it is. The defenders and haters of this film are right: It's STUPID, and that's the point. The movie accepts the stupidity of the characters much in the same way "The Jerk" accepted Navin Johnson's idiocy. And because it takes that and runs with it, the movie focuses exclusively on using that to forward the plot and to define the characters. A "bad" movie would actually do this and fail to use that logic properly; bad movie are bad because they make it up as they go along, whereas movies like "The Stupids" knows where it's going, what it's doing and why from the beginning. I can't defend the film from an artistic standpoint, which is why I give it such a low rating.

But I can't deny that it IS entertaining in its own way, and that's why I defend it. I got it right away, and I pity those who don't. I'll admit I was drawn to this movie because of Christopher Lee's delicious cameo appearance (hearing him say "Release the drive bee!" would have been worth the rental price even if I hated this film), but was amazed to find that, aside from the TV Studio Applause Sign segment with Jenny McCarthy, I was never bored, and never disappointed. In fact, many of the jokes, because of their cartoonish context, were hilarious (in particular the airbag-cigarette explosion). They were dumb, but they were funny. And the movie doesn't pretend to be anything else: a STUPID comedy about STUPID characters and instead of apologizing for it, it enjoys itself. And that's exactly why it works.

It's very aggressive with it's delivery of gags, then ignores the gag part totally, and then to see how everything nests into everything else so subtly, you almost wonder if the Stupid family are actually of some kind of mad genius savants. They definitely live in a different reality than we do, and the joke of the film is that it actually all works, in a way that isn't forced. See it. Get it from the DVD bargain bin. This film deserves a shot to make you laugh.

    When I first saw this movie I was about 14 years old and nearly died laughing. Ten years later years I still burst my sides from this witty film. Now I'm not big on Tom Arnold as an actor but he definitely makes the perfect Stanley Stupid. Besides from a few cheezy parts like the very poorly computer animated pet dog & cat this movie is pure conspiracy theory comedic genius. There are so many hilarious jokes that somehow move the plot along... 8 wheels beats 4 wheels, 10-1-1 over 9-1-1, the Lloyd, "Man-Bush" come on people! I can't believe anyone could actually consider this one of this worst movies ever made. Go ahead and spend another 5 bucks & purchase the film (buying it new might be cheaper than renting it), get over the PG rating and laugh your @$*%! off at this hilarious comedy!!

    This is probably the only film I've seen where the IMDb reviews on both sides of the spectrum are 100% accurate. "The Stupids" is an atrocious, dim-witted film with absolutely no artistic merit whatsoever, and is a denigration to a director like John Landis. And that's what makes it great. In order to appreciate "The Stupids", you have to keep in mind a little-known, but very true maxim spoken by director Abo Kyrou: "I urge you to learn to look at bad films, they are so often sublime." In order for any film to work, the film must establish and follow it's own logic, and if it does so convincingly and sincerely, then it's actually possible for the film to work. For example, when you watch "Freddy Got Fingered" as a traditional gross-out comedy, it's complete and utter garbage; when you watch it with the understanding that it's actually a neo-surrealist comedy, it's brilliant. It works with good movies too. If "Jaws" hadn't accepted the reality it created, the air-tank explosion ending wouldn't have worked. But, a lot of people think "Jaws" is vastly overrated for this type of reason, and they aren't wrong. But it has it's strengths, doesn't it? The point being that a movie like this makes sense if you look at it with the right perspective. Some people, like me, get it right away, while others never will no matter how often it's explained. Jim Jarmusch made a compelling defense of "Showgirls" once, and even afterwards I still can't see it from his P.O.V. Doesn't mean he's wrong though. If you have the right frame of mind when you watch this movie (and NO I DO NOT MEAN STONED, I'm gonna put that to bed right now), you can actually enjoy the movie for the dumb, cheap, pointless slapstick late-80s/early-90s-style farce that it is. The defenders and haters of this film are right: It's STUPID, and that's the point. The movie accepts the stupidity of the characters much in the same way "The Jerk" accepted Navin Johnson's idiocy. And because it takes that and runs with it, the movie focuses exclusively on using that to forward the plot and to define the characters. A "bad" movie would actually do this and fail to use that logic properly; bad movie are bad because they make it up as they go along, whereas movies like "The Stupids" knows where it's going, what it's doing and why from the beginning. I can't defend the film from an artistic standpoint, which is why I give it such a low rating. The acting is mostly bad, the jokes very superficial, and the live-action quality probably ruins what would have worked as a cartoon. But I can't deny that it IS entertaining in its own way, and that's why I defend it. I got it right away, and I pity those who don't. I'll admit I was drawn to this movie because of Christopher Lee's delicious cameo appearance (hearing him say "Release the drive bee!" would have been worth the rental price even if I hated this film), but was amazed to find that, aside from the TV Studio Applause Sign segment with Jenny McCarthy, I was never bored, and never disappointed. In fact, many of the jokes, because of their cartoonish context, were hilarious (in particular the airbag-cigarette explosion). They were dumb, but they were funny. And the movie doesn't pretend to be anything else: a STUPID comedy about STUPID characters and instead of apologizing for it, it enjoys itself. And that's exactly why it works.

    I absolutely find this movie to be very entertaining, funny, and full of great lines! Due to the mixed reviews and somewhat low ratings, I'd definitely consider this film to be a cult classic. Winning the Razzie Award for Worst Actor must have been a dream come true for Tom Arnold and he's sure at his best in this very movie! Possibly the best part in this movie is the song "I'm My Own Grandpaw", sung by Tom Arnold! The song is very nostalgic and funny! I don't care if this film wasn't well-received or if it grossed a reasonably small amount of money. I still love this movie, and for all those who are giving this film negative reviews, return your negative reviews to Sender! This film is one of the cult best!

I by chance started watching it today, and I've been in tears laughing my butt off all day long watching it. This movie is basically non-stop hilarious idiotic one-liners and absurd vaudeville comedy like scenes. It's very reminiscent of the comedy style of Airplane and all its sequels and the deadpan absurdity of Leslie Nielsen. And it doesn't slow down at all, it actually gets funnier and funnier. I guess this type of comedy isn't everyone's cup of tea, but if you liked Airplane, you'll love The Stupids. I gave it a 9 'cause it's just, that, stupid.

I'd prefer to sit through a torture experience worse than Daniel Craig endured in his first bond movie than suffer through an hour and a half of "The Stupids". I'd much rather have my balls tied to a doorknob and slammed hard against that god forsaken wall than have to suffer through this tragic joke of a movie. Whoever directed this movie needs to be ostracized from his profession and exiled in a small shack in Puerto Rico never to have anything to do with the arts again. The fact is was offered on direct TV boggles my mind. Drives me crazy. It should made illegal to even speak of the title. I suppose there is one bright side of "The Stupids".

    I haven't read a single other review of this film. That is next on my list of things to do. But I will say that this silly movie in uncannily funny. The credit goes equally to the four principal characters. If you like this movie it will be because you can appreciate when great actors can make the most trite comic premise work. The movies is simply about a middle class family whose every member is dumber than a dog. They are on a quest to find out who steals their garbage regularly (sanitation engineers of course) and from there it proceeds and succeeds. For example my favorite bit is when Tom Arnold reenters his car from the passenger side and concludes that he can no longer drive the car as the ignition and steering wheel are no longer in his direct line of sight ( or something like that). Honestly, this thing is funny and Tom Arnold is a funny guy.

    I took my son to see this with every intention of watching a completely goofy movie since we love other titles such as The Jerk, Airplane, etc. However, we couldn't sit through more than ten minutes before getting up and leaving the theater, fore-fitting our admission cost and all. It was just TOO stupid, so stupid that my brain was starting to hurt. So, despite the fact that 10 minutes isn't enough to give it a fair assessment, I think leaving a moving after only 10 minutes is a testimony of its own. I may see if I can find this on Netflix to see if my 15 year old memories of it are still accurate. And it may be worth the time to get some Mystery Science Theater style entertainment out of this train-wreck.

    Seriously, this movie is full of incredibly unfunny jokes that makes this one "stupid" movie (the movie is worse than that pun right there). Yes it is horrible, don't watch it, don't waste any money on it. The only people that could find this humorous are 5 year old children, in no way should this be funny to anyone who's age is above that. It IS the worst movie ever produced. The movie is not witty, it's jokes are... ugh, actually no, they aren't jokes, in fact, I don't know what they are. I just don't have the words to describe how terrible this movie is. Once again, I will reiterate: Don't watch it and don't waste money on it.

    Utter, complete, total garbage! STAY AWAY PLEASE! I am lost for words to describe just how belittling and patronizing this is. I've noticed that one reviewer commented on the "classic" scenes such as 'I'm My Own Grandpa' or something like that...well I just saw this supposed masterpiece of a scene and it is pathetic. I can understand that this movie is being deliberately stupid but that is exactly what bugs me. The acting and the supposed funny moments are clearly fake, predictable, overacted, clich&eacute;d and not funny. Dumb & Dumber for instance was also about two abnormally stupid guys but there was a sense that the movie allowed for you to pick up the stupid moments-and yes, while they weren't hard to pick up at least it wasn't in-your-face-turn-at-the-camera-and-over-emphasize-the words type of moments. Furthermore, in Dumb & Dumber while the two main characters were stupid, nobody else in the movie was. Here, EVERYBODY in the movie is as stupid, dim and dense as the main 'characters'. And at least D&D had a degree of realism in that as stupid as the main characters were, their low-life lifestyle matched them. Here, the Stupids are a well-off family yet utterly useless! I realize I may be babbling but movies like this irritate because I fail to see why people bother making them and in so doing insult moviegoers to such a degree. There's no no pint in "taking intelligence out of the equation" as one reviewer noted because if a movie can be funny and entertaining with a degree of intelligence in it, why should you take intelligence out of this movie? Is it because the makers had none themselves and were too lazy to put in an effort with this movie? It's a crime to call this a comedy or a movie. The animated pets and aliens at the end utterly made me lose the plot! I only watched about 20min and I was left irritated for days. It is annoying and a waste of time...you'd have a better time listening to your plants grow.

    This movie provides the answer to the age-old question I know some of you have asked yourselves at least once, "How can someone be so stupid and still remain living?" If you're going to enjoy this movie, you have to be a willing co-conspirator, able to reserve judgement. You have to meet this movie on it's own level, not expect it to come to you. Like a play instead of a modern, 'ran through tons of focus groups', Hollywood flick. If you go in feeling lots of skepticism or feel like your 'inner film-critic' wants to watch the movie with you for live analysis, then go see "The Piano". If you want to see an absurd spectacle made of the "modern" nuclear family, with a subversive glint, and a Hollywood (low)budget, perhaps to almost suffocate from laughter, then watch 'The Stupids'. Stanley was a role Tom Arnold was born to play. OK, first understand that this movie isn't played like your average American 'popular comedy' movie.(As evidenced by it's poor box office showing.) The characters come from a series of children's books that gained a global underground following after a number of Family Values Groups tried to get it banned in the US. So that sets the stage for me for what they were actually trying to do with this movie, and I love the hell of out it. The director and the writers and heck, even the underwriters really had some balls to put this movie out like they did. A real gamble to make "a bad movie, well done", totally on purpose. None of the characters are social archetypes that are 'too cool for school', they're not going to bank on pop culture references or nostalgia, they don't expect you to relate to what you're seeing or sympathize with the characters. I don't want to say Brechtian, but it's definitely old-school theatre style. Everything is done for the pure purpose of hilarious spectacle, to make the viewer question both what they're seeing, and their sanity. When Mrs. Stupid comes out wearing that camouflage dress she made out of wigs, I knew I had lost it. You won't see that anywhere else, played straight like it was, like, "there's mom, in a ghillie suit made of wigs.", in perfect context, and almost making sense? You either take this movie at face value, and run the risk of some of the best parts flying over your head, or you can understand that this movie plays on a totally different level. It's very aggressive with it's delivery of gags, then ignores the gag part totally, and then to see how everything nests into everything else so subtly, you almost wonder if the Stupid family are actually of some kind of mad genius savants. They definitely live in a different reality than we do, and the joke of the film is that it actually all works, in a way that isn't forced. See it. Get it from the DVD bargain bin. This film deserves a shot to make you laugh.

    This movie provides the answer to the age-old question I know some of you have asked yourselves at least once, "How can someone be so stupid and still remain living?" If you're going to enjoy this movie, you have to be a willing co-conspirator, able to reserve judgement. You have to meet this movie on it's own level, not expect it to come to you. Like a play instead of a modern, 'ran through tons of focus groups', Hollywood flick. If you go in feeling lots of skepticism or feel like your 'inner film-critic' wants to watch the movie with you for live analysis, then go see "The Piano". If you want to see an absurd spectacle made of the "modern" nuclear family, with a subversive glint, and a Hollywood (low)budget, perhaps to almost suffocate from laughter, then watch 'The Stupids'. Stanley was a role Tom Arnold was born to play. OK, first understand that this movie isn't played like your average American 'popular comedy' movie.(As evidenced by it's poor box office showing.) The characters come from a series of children's books that gained a global underground following after a number of Family Values Groups tried to get it banned in the US. So that sets the stage for me for what they were actually trying to do with this movie, and I love the hell of out it. The director and the writers and heck, even the underwriters really had some balls to put this movie out like they did. A real gamble to make "a bad movie, well done", totally on purpose. None of the characters are social archetypes that are 'too cool for school', they're not going to bank on pop culture references or nostalgia, they don't expect you to relate to what you're seeing or sympathize with the characters. I don't want to say Brechtian, but it's definitely old-school theatre style. Everything is done for the pure purpose of hilarious spectacle, to make the viewer question both what they're seeing, and their sanity. When Mrs. Stupid comes out wearing that camouflage dress she made out of wigs, I knew I had lost it. You won't see that anywhere else, played straight like it was, like, "there's mom, in a ghillie suit made of wigs.", in perfect context, and almost making sense? You either take this movie at face value, and run the risk of some of the best parts flying over your head, or you can understand that this movie plays on a totally different level. It's very aggressive with it's delivery of gags, then ignores the gag part totally, and then to see how everything nests into everything else so subtly, you almost wonder if the Stupid family are actually of some kind of mad genius savants. They definitely live in a different reality than we do, and the joke of the film is that it actually all works, in a way that isn't forced. See it. Get it from the DVD bargain bin. This film deserves a shot to make you laugh.

    When I first saw this movie I was about 14 years old and nearly died laughing. Ten years later years I still burst my sides from this witty film. Now I'm not big on Tom Arnold as an actor but he definitely makes the perfect Stanley Stupid. Besides from a few cheezy parts like the very poorly computer animated pet dog & cat this movie is pure conspiracy theory comedic genius. There are so many hilarious jokes that somehow move the plot along... 8 wheels beats 4 wheels, 10-1-1 over 9-1-1, the Lloyd, "Man-Bush" come on people! I can't believe anyone could actually consider this one of this worst movies ever made. Go ahead and spend another 5 bucks & purchase the film (buying it new might be cheaper than renting it), get over the PG rating and laugh your @$*%! off at this hilarious comedy!!

    This is probably the only film I've seen where the IMDb reviews on both sides of the spectrum are 100% accurate. "The Stupids" is an atrocious, dim-witted film with absolutely no artistic merit whatsoever, and is a denigration to a director like John Landis. And that's what makes it great. In order to appreciate "The Stupids", you have to keep in mind a little-known, but very true maxim spoken by director Abo Kyrou: "I urge you to learn to look at bad films, they are so often sublime." In order for any film to work, the film must establish and follow it's own logic, and if it does so convincingly and sincerely, then it's actually possible for the film to work. For example, when you watch "Freddy Got Fingered" as a traditional gross-out comedy, it's complete and utter garbage; when you watch it with the understanding that it's actually a neo-surrealist comedy, it's brilliant. It works with good movies too. If "Jaws" hadn't accepted the reality it created, the air-tank explosion ending wouldn't have worked. But, a lot of people think "Jaws" is vastly overrated for this type of reason, and they aren't wrong. But it has it's strengths, doesn't it? The point being that a movie like this makes sense if you look at it with the right perspective. Some people, like me, get it right away, while others never will no matter how often it's explained. Jim Jarmusch made a compelling defense of "Showgirls" once, and even afterwards I still can't see it from his P.O.V. Doesn't mean he's wrong though. If you have the right frame of mind when you watch this movie (and NO I DO NOT MEAN STONED, I'm gonna put that to bed right now), you can actually enjoy the movie for the dumb, cheap, pointless slapstick late-80s/early-90s-style farce that it is. The defenders and haters of this film are right: It's STUPID, and that's the point. The movie accepts the stupidity of the characters much in the same way "The Jerk" accepted Navin Johnson's idiocy. And because it takes that and runs with it, the movie focuses exclusively on using that to forward the plot and to define the characters. A "bad" movie would actually do this and fail to use that logic properly; bad movie are bad because they make it up as they go along, whereas movies like "The Stupids" knows where it's going, what it's doing and why from the beginning. I can't defend the film from an artistic standpoint, which is why I give it such a low rating. The acting is mostly bad, the jokes very superficial, and the live-action quality probably ruins what would have worked as a cartoon. But I can't deny that it IS entertaining in its own way, and that's why I defend it. I got it right away, and I pity those who don't. I'll admit I was drawn to this movie because of Christopher Lee's delicious cameo appearance (hearing him say "Release the drive bee!" would have been worth the rental price even if I hated this film), but was amazed to find that, aside from the TV Studio Applause Sign segment with Jenny McCarthy, I was never bored, and never disappointed. In fact, many of the jokes, because of their cartoonish context, were hilarious (in particular the airbag-cigarette explosion). They were dumb, but they were funny. And the movie doesn't pretend to be anything else: a STUPID comedy about STUPID characters and instead of apologizing for it, it enjoys itself. And that's exactly why it works.

    I absolutely find this movie to be very entertaining, funny, and full of great lines! Due to the mixed reviews and somewhat low ratings, I'd definitely consider this film to be a cult classic. Winning the Razzie Award for Worst Actor must have been a dream come true for Tom Arnold and he's sure at his best in this very movie! Possibly the best part in this movie is the song "I'm My Own Grandpaw", sung by Tom Arnold! The song is very nostalgic and funny! I don't care if this film wasn't well-received or if it grossed a reasonably small amount of money. I still love this movie, and for all those who are giving this film negative reviews, return your negative reviews to Sender! This film is one of the cult best!

    I don't know why this has such a low score on IMDb, and i don't know why I've never seen it before. I by chance started watching it today, and I've been in tears laughing my butt off all day long watching it. This movie is basically non-stop hilarious idiotic one-liners and absurd vaudeville comedy like scenes. It's very reminiscent of the comedy style of Airplane and all its sequels and the deadpan absurdity of Leslie Nielsen. And it doesn't slow down at all, it actually gets funnier and funnier. I guess this type of comedy isn't everyone's cup of tea, but if you liked Airplane, you'll love The Stupids. I gave it a 9 'cause it's just, that, stupid.

I'd prefer to sit through a torture experience worse than Daniel Craig endured in his first bond movie than suffer through an hour and a half of "The Stupids". I'd much rather have my balls tied to a doorknob and slammed hard against that god forsaken wall than have to suffer through this tragic joke of a movie. Whoever directed this movie needs to be ostracized from his profession and exiled in a small shack in Puerto Rico never to have anything to do with the arts again. The fact is was offered on direct TV boggles my mind. Drives me crazy. It should made illegal to even speak of the title. I suppose there is one bright side of "The Stupids". It exemplifies how not to make a good movie, rather a horrifically tragic movie.

    I haven't read a single other review of this film. That is next on my list of things to do. But I will say that this silly movie in uncannily funny. The credit goes equally to the four principal characters. If you like this movie it will be because you can appreciate when great actors can make the most trite comic premise work. The movies is simply about a middle class family whose every member is dumber than a dog. They are on a quest to find out who steals their garbage regularly (sanitation engineers of course) and from there it proceeds and succeeds. For example my favorite bit is when Tom Arnold reenters his car from the passenger side and concludes that he can no longer drive the car as the ignition and steering wheel are no longer in his direct line of sight ( or something like that). Honestly, this thing is funny and Tom Arnold is a funny guy.

    I took my son to see this with every intention of watching a completely goofy movie since we love other titles such as The Jerk, Airplane, etc. However, we couldn't sit through more than ten minutes before getting up and leaving the theater, fore-fitting our admission cost and all. It was just TOO stupid, so stupid that my brain was starting to hurt. So, despite the fact that 10 minutes isn't enough to give it a fair assessment, I think leaving a moving after only 10 minutes is a testimony of its own. I may see if I can find this on Netflix to see if my 15 year old memories of it are still accurate. And it may be worth the time to get some Mystery Science Theater style entertainment out of this train-wreck.

    Seriously, this movie is full of incredibly unfunny jokes that makes this one "stupid" movie (the movie is worse than that pun right there). Yes it is horrible, don't watch it, don't waste any money on it. The only people that could find this humorous are 5 year old children, in no way should this be funny to anyone who's age is above that. It IS the worst movie ever produced. The movie is not witty, it's jokes are... ugh, actually no, they aren't jokes, in fact, I don't know what they are. I just don't have the words to describe how terrible this movie is. Once again, I will reiterate: Don't watch it and don't waste money on it.

    Utter, complete, total garbage! STAY AWAY PLEASE! I am lost for words to describe just how belittling and patronizing this is. I've noticed that one reviewer commented on the "classic" scenes such as 'I'm My Own Grandpa' or something like that...well I just saw this supposed masterpiece of a scene and it is pathetic. I can understand that this movie is being deliberately stupid but that is exactly what bugs me. The acting and the supposed funny moments are clearly fake, predictable, overacted, clich&eacute;d and not funny. Dumb & Dumber for instance was also about two abnormally stupid guys but there was a sense that the movie allowed for you to pick up the stupid moments-and yes, while they weren't hard to pick up at least it wasn't in-your-face-turn-at-the-camera-and-over-emphasize-the words type of moments. Furthermore, in Dumb & Dumber while the two main characters were stupid, nobody else in the movie was. Here, EVERYBODY in the movie is as stupid, dim and dense as the main 'characters'. And at least D&D had a degree of realism in that as stupid as the main characters were, their low-life lifestyle matched them. Here, the Stupids are a well-off family yet utterly useless! I realize I may be babbling but movies like this irritate because I fail to see why people bother making them and in so doing insult moviegoers to such a degree. There's no no pint in "taking intelligence out of the equation" as one reviewer noted because if a movie can be funny and entertaining with a degree of intelligence in it, why should you take intelligence out of this movie? Is it because the makers had none themselves and were too lazy to put in an effort with this movie? It's a crime to call this a comedy or a movie. The animated pets and aliens at the end utterly made me lose the plot! I only watched about 20min and I was left irritated for days. It is annoying and a waste of time...you'd have a better time listening to your plants grow.

    This movie provides the answer to the age-old question I know some of you have asked yourselves at least once, "How can someone be so stupid and still remain living?" If you're going to enjoy this movie, you have to be a willing co-conspirator, able to reserve judgement. You have to meet this movie on it's own level, not expect it to come to you. Like a play instead of a modern, 'ran through tons of focus groups', Hollywood flick. If you go in feeling lots of skepticism or feel like your 'inner film-critic' wants to watch the movie with you for live analysis, then go see "The Piano". If you want to see an absurd spectacle made of the "modern" nuclear family, with a subversive glint, and a Hollywood (low)budget, perhaps to almost suffocate from laughter, then watch 'The Stupids'. Stanley was a role Tom Arnold was born to play. OK, first understand that this movie isn't played like your average American 'popular comedy' movie.(As evidenced by it's poor box office showing.) The characters come from a series of children's books that gained a global underground following after a number of Family Values Groups tried to get it banned in the US. So that sets the stage for me for what they were actually trying to do with this movie, and I love the hell of out it. The director and the writers and heck, even the underwriters really had some balls to put this movie out like they did. A real gamble to make "a bad movie, well done", totally on purpose. None of the characters are social archetypes that are 'too cool for school', they're not going to bank on pop culture references or nostalgia, they don't expect you to relate to what you're seeing or sympathize with the characters. I don't want to say Brechtian, but it's definitely old-school theatre style. Everything is done for the pure purpose of hilarious spectacle, to make the viewer question both what they're seeing, and their sanity. When Mrs. Stupid comes out wearing that camouflage dress she made out of wigs, I knew I had lost it. You won't see that anywhere else, played straight like it was, like, "there's mom, in a ghillie suit made of wigs.", in perfect context, and almost making sense? You either take this movie at face value, and run the risk of some of the best parts flying over your head, or you can understand that this movie plays on a totally different level. It's very aggressive with it's delivery of gags, then ignores the gag part totally, and then to see how everything nests into everything else so subtly, you almost wonder if the Stupid family are actually of some kind of mad genius savants. They definitely live in a different reality than we do, and the joke of the film is that it actually all works, in a way that isn't forced. See it. Get it from the DVD bargain bin. This film deserves a shot to make you laugh.

The credit goes equally to the four principal characters. If you like this movie it will be because you can appreciate when great actors can make the most trite comic premise work. The movies is simply about a middle class family whose every member is dumber than a dog. They are on a quest to find out who steals their garbage regularly (sanitation engineers of course) and from there it proceeds and succeeds. For example my favorite bit is when Tom Arnold reenters his car from the passenger side and concludes that he can no longer drive the car as the ignition and steering wheel are no longer in his direct line of sight ( or something like that).

    Utter, complete, total garbage! STAY AWAY PLEASE! I am lost for words to describe just how belittling and patronizing this is. I've noticed that one reviewer commented on the "classic" scenes such as 'I'm My Own Grandpa' or something like that...well I just saw this supposed masterpiece of a scene and it is pathetic. I can understand that this movie is being deliberately stupid but that is exactly what bugs me. The acting and the supposed funny moments are clearly fake, predictable, overacted, clich&eacute;d and not funny. Dumb & Dumber for instance was also about two abnormally stupid guys but there was a sense that the movie allowed for you to pick up the stupid moments-and yes, while they weren't hard to pick up at least it wasn't in-your-face-turn-at-the-camera-and-over-emphasize-the words type of moments. Furthermore, in Dumb & Dumber while the two main characters were stupid, nobody else in the movie was. Here, EVERYBODY in the movie is as stupid, dim and dense as the main 'characters'. And at least D&D had a degree of realism in that as stupid as the main characters were, their low-life lifestyle matched them. Here, the Stupids are a well-off family yet utterly useless! I realize I may be babbling but movies like this irritate because I fail to see why people bother making them and in so doing insult moviegoers to such a degree. There's no no pint in "taking intelligence out of the equation" as one reviewer noted because if a movie can be funny and entertaining with a degree of intelligence in it, why should you take intelligence out of this movie? Is it because the makers had none themselves and were too lazy to put in an effort with this movie? It's a crime to call this a comedy or a movie. The animated pets and aliens at the end utterly made me lose the plot! I only watched about 20min and I was left irritated for days. It is annoying and a waste of time...you'd have a better time listening to your plants grow.

    This movie provides the answer to the age-old question I know some of you have asked yourselves at least once, "How can someone be so stupid and still remain living?" If you're going to enjoy this movie, you have to be a willing co-conspirator, able to reserve judgement. You have to meet this movie on it's own level, not expect it to come to you. Like a play instead of a modern, 'ran through tons of focus groups', Hollywood flick. If you go in feeling lots of skepticism or feel like your 'inner film-critic' wants to watch the movie with you for live analysis, then go see "The Piano". If you want to see an absurd spectacle made of the "modern" nuclear family, with a subversive glint, and a Hollywood (low)budget, perhaps to almost suffocate from laughter, then watch 'The Stupids'. Stanley was a role Tom Arnold was born to play. OK, first understand that this movie isn't played like your average American 'popular comedy' movie.(As evidenced by it's poor box office showing.) The characters come from a series of children's books that gained a global underground following after a number of Family Values Groups tried to get it banned in the US. So that sets the stage for me for what they were actually trying to do with this movie, and I love the hell of out it. The director and the writers and heck, even the underwriters really had some balls to put this movie out like they did. A real gamble to make "a bad movie, well done", totally on purpose. None of the characters are social archetypes that are 'too cool for school', they're not going to bank on pop culture references or nostalgia, they don't expect you to relate to what you're seeing or sympathize with the characters. I don't want to say Brechtian, but it's definitely old-school theatre style. Everything is done for the pure purpose of hilarious spectacle, to make the viewer question both what they're seeing, and their sanity. When Mrs. Stupid comes out wearing that camouflage dress she made out of wigs, I knew I had lost it. You won't see that anywhere else, played straight like it was, like, "there's mom, in a ghillie suit made of wigs.", in perfect context, and almost making sense? You either take this movie at face value, and run the risk of some of the best parts flying over your head, or you can understand that this movie plays on a totally different level. It's very aggressive with it's delivery of gags, then ignores the gag part totally, and then to see how everything nests into everything else so subtly, you almost wonder if the Stupid family are actually of some kind of mad genius savants. They definitely live in a different reality than we do, and the joke of the film is that it actually all works, in a way that isn't forced. See it. Get it from the DVD bargain bin. This film deserves a shot to make you laugh.

    When I first saw this movie I was about 14 years old and nearly died laughing. Ten years later years I still burst my sides from this witty film. Now I'm not big on Tom Arnold as an actor but he definitely makes the perfect Stanley Stupid. Besides from a few cheezy parts like the very poorly computer animated pet dog & cat this movie is pure conspiracy theory comedic genius. There are so many hilarious jokes that somehow move the plot along... 8 wheels beats 4 wheels, 10-1-1 over 9-1-1, the Lloyd, "Man-Bush" come on people! I can't believe anyone could actually consider this one of this worst movies ever made. Go ahead and spend another 5 bucks & purchase the film (buying it new might be cheaper than renting it), get over the PG rating and laugh your @$*%! off at this hilarious comedy!!

    This is probably the only film I've seen where the IMDb reviews on both sides of the spectrum are 100% accurate. "The Stupids" is an atrocious, dim-witted film with absolutely no artistic merit whatsoever, and is a denigration to a director like John Landis. And that's what makes it great. In order to appreciate "The Stupids", you have to keep in mind a little-known, but very true maxim spoken by director Abo Kyrou: "I urge you to learn to look at bad films, they are so often sublime." In order for any film to work, the film must establish and follow it's own logic, and if it does so convincingly and sincerely, then it's actually possible for the film to work. For example, when you watch "Freddy Got Fingered" as a traditional gross-out comedy, it's complete and utter garbage; when you watch it with the understanding that it's actually a neo-surrealist comedy, it's brilliant. It works with good movies too. If "Jaws" hadn't accepted the reality it created, the air-tank explosion ending wouldn't have worked. But, a lot of people think "Jaws" is vastly overrated for this type of reason, and they aren't wrong. But it has it's strengths, doesn't it? The point being that a movie like this makes sense if you look at it with the right perspective. Some people, like me, get it right away, while others never will no matter how often it's explained. Jim Jarmusch made a compelling defense of "Showgirls" once, and even afterwards I still can't see it from his P.O.V. Doesn't mean he's wrong though. If you have the right frame of mind when you watch this movie (and NO I DO NOT MEAN STONED, I'm gonna put that to bed right now), you can actually enjoy the movie for the dumb, cheap, pointless slapstick late-80s/early-90s-style farce that it is. The defenders and haters of this film are right: It's STUPID, and that's the point. The movie accepts the stupidity of the characters much in the same way "The Jerk" accepted Navin Johnson's idiocy. And because it takes that and runs with it, the movie focuses exclusively on using that to forward the plot and to define the characters. A "bad" movie would actually do this and fail to use that logic properly; bad movie are bad because they make it up as they go along, whereas movies like "The Stupids" knows where it's going, what it's doing and why from the beginning. I can't defend the film from an artistic standpoint, which is why I give it such a low rating. The acting is mostly bad, the jokes very superficial, and the live-action quality probably ruins what would have worked as a cartoon. But I can't deny that it IS entertaining in its own way, and that's why I defend it. I got it right away, and I pity those who don't. I'll admit I was drawn to this movie because of Christopher Lee's delicious cameo appearance (hearing him say "Release the drive bee!" would have been worth the rental price even if I hated this film), but was amazed to find that, aside from the TV Studio Applause Sign segment with Jenny McCarthy, I was never bored, and never disappointed. In fact, many of the jokes, because of their cartoonish context, were hilarious (in particular the airbag-cigarette explosion). They were dumb, but they were funny. And the movie doesn't pretend to be anything else: a STUPID comedy about STUPID characters and instead of apologizing for it, it enjoys itself. And that's exactly why it works.

    I absolutely find this movie to be very entertaining, funny, and full of great lines! Due to the mixed reviews and somewhat low ratings, I'd definitely consider this film to be a cult classic. Winning the Razzie Award for Worst Actor must have been a dream come true for Tom Arnold and he's sure at his best in this very movie! Possibly the best part in this movie is the song "I'm My Own Grandpaw", sung by Tom Arnold! The song is very nostalgic and funny! I don't care if this film wasn't well-received or if it grossed a reasonably small amount of money. I still love this movie, and for all those who are giving this film negative reviews, return your negative reviews to Sender! This film is one of the cult best!

    I don't know why this has such a low score on IMDb, and i don't know why I've never seen it before. I by chance started watching it today, and I've been in tears laughing my butt off all day long watching it. This movie is basically non-stop hilarious idiotic one-liners and absurd vaudeville comedy like scenes. It's very reminiscent of the comedy style of Airplane and all its sequels and the deadpan absurdity of Leslie Nielsen. And it doesn't slow down at all, it actually gets funnier and funnier. I guess this type of comedy isn't everyone's cup of tea, but if you liked Airplane, you'll love The Stupids. I gave it a 9 'cause it's just, that, stupid.

    The highlight of this embarrassment of contemporary American cinema was the ending credits. I'd prefer to sit through a torture experience worse than Daniel Craig endured in his first bond movie than suffer through an hour and a half of "The Stupids". I'd much rather have my balls tied to a doorknob and slammed hard against that god forsaken wall than have to suffer through this tragic joke of a movie. Whoever directed this movie needs to be ostracized from his profession and exiled in a small shack in Puerto Rico never to have anything to do with the arts again. The fact is was offered on direct TV boggles my mind. Drives me crazy. It should made illegal to even speak of the title. I suppose there is one bright side of "The Stupids". It exemplifies how not to make a good movie, rather a horrifically tragic movie.

    I haven't read a single other review of this film. That is next on my list of things to do. But I will say that this silly movie in uncannily funny. The credit goes equally to the four principal characters. If you like this movie it will be because you can appreciate when great actors can make the most trite comic premise work. The movies is simply about a middle class family whose every member is dumber than a dog. They are on a quest to find out who steals their garbage regularly (sanitation engineers of course) and from there it proceeds and succeeds. For example my favorite bit is when Tom Arnold reenters his car from the passenger side and concludes that he can no longer drive the car as the ignition and steering wheel are no longer in his direct line of sight ( or something like that). Honestly, this thing is funny and Tom Arnold is a funny guy.

    I took my son to see this with every intention of watching a completely goofy movie since we love other titles such as The Jerk, Airplane, etc. However, we couldn't sit through more than ten minutes before getting up and leaving the theater, fore-fitting our admission cost and all. It was just TOO stupid, so stupid that my brain was starting to hurt. So, despite the fact that 10 minutes isn't enough to give it a fair assessment, I think leaving a moving after only 10 minutes is a testimony of its own. I may see if I can find this on Netflix to see if my 15 year old memories of it are still accurate. And it may be worth the time to get some Mystery Science Theater style entertainment out of this train-wreck.

    Seriously, this movie is full of incredibly unfunny jokes that makes this one "stupid" movie (the movie is worse than that pun right there). Yes it is horrible, don't watch it, don't waste any money on it. The only people that could find this humorous are 5 year old children, in no way should this be funny to anyone who's age is above that. It IS the worst movie ever produced. The movie is not witty, it's jokes are... ugh, actually no, they aren't jokes, in fact, I don't know what they are. I just don't have the words to describe how terrible this movie is. Once again, I will reiterate: Don't watch it and don't waste money on it.
