 <sinopse>
  During the Spanish Civil War, an American allied with the Republicans finds romance during a desperate mission to blow up a strategically important bridge.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Spain in the 1930s is the place to be for a man of action like Robert Jordan. There is a civil war going on and Jordan who has joined up on the side that appeals most to idealists of that era -- like Ernest Hemingway and his friends -- has been given a high-risk assignment up in the mountains. He awaits the right time to blow up a bridge in a cave. Pilar, who is in charge there, has an ability to foretell the future. And so that night she encourages Maria, a young girl ravaged by enemy soldiers, to join Jordan who has decided to spend the night under the stars.

    As a Spaniard and a historian, I've always found this film deeply moving. Here in Spain, the films on our Civil War have become so common that, for youngest people, the war seems to be some kind of ancient mythology. This movie allows us to see how the Spanish War was perceived by other countries in contemporary dates. Actually, we cannot forget its importance as a test for WWII. Maria's life remind me of the stories that my grandma used to tell. Men went to war, but women were often ravaged by the winner army as revenge. What really amazes me is the lack of awareness that many people have on my country and their audacity on showing it. I think that's the effect of decades of Mexican actors playing Spaniards in Hollywood films. As a blonde, pale skinned, Caucasian woman, as the majority of my compatriots (remember, we're Europeans), I think Bergman's appearance fits perfectly her part.

    The Spanish Civil war is a conflict that has seared itself upon the romantic idealist . It's good versus evil of fascists on one side and idealistic freedom fighters from all across the world fighting to save a democratic socialist Republic from the jackboot of Hitler , Mussolini and Franco . Of course much of this conflict has been romanticized . It's often forgotten that Joseph Stalin was supporting the Republican cause while following his own agenda and the leftists spent more time fighting amongst themselves rather than fighting the Falangists . Regardless of this I've always viewed it as good versus evil , an opinion reinforced by a conversation I once had with a Spanish workmate who was of " Marrano Converso " linage whose grandparents were murdered by the Franco regime . I told her gloomily that's the worst thing about the 21st Century - there's no crusades to go on , no chance of jumping on a plane and changing the world . Though later when I thought about it there is a modern day equivalent and that is young people joining the military in NATO countries knowing fine well they'll be serving in Afghanistan fighting against murderous jihadists . Was it not Orwell himself who described all tyrannies being " theocracies in nature " ? Perhaps idealism gets the better of me and I have grown out of it because the opening scene of FOR WHOM THE BELLS TOLL has stayed with me since childhood . Two freedom fighters blow up a train , make their escape only for one of them to be wounded and he begs his comrade to shoot him . It's an impressive scene though its impact is negated having been done so many times in other films . I guess this was probably the first time I'd seen this type of scene and that's why it stayed with me . The mind of a child is very impressionable and idealistic I'm afraid that my idealism towards this film has become somewhat revisionist after seeing it again as an adult. Not a lot happens in the movie which is composed of a handful of characters sitting on two or three sets of studio exteriors spouting clich&eacute;d melodramatic dialogue along with an annoying incidental score that never seems to go away . Interesting to note that the screenplay has most of its politics exercised and there's only one scene where the idealistic manly hero Robert Jordan played by Gary Cooper at his most wooden explaining the reason why he joined the good fight This means you're a watching a film lacking in scope . When I say nothing much happens I mean this literally . Some people might appreciate the set design or cinematography but the film concentrates on the romance between Jordan and Maria and Jordan's abrasive relationship with the band of Gypsies . There's very little sense of time and place and I had to keep reminding myself that it's set in Spain in 1937. It's also a film that is very static and dated even to fans of Classic Hollywood like myself and someone would do better reading George Orwell's Homage To Catalonia than watching this Hollywood melodrama

    For Whom the Bells Tolls is a thrilling novel and one of the most acclaimed books of the 20Th century. It depict very accurately the turmoil of Spain during the civil war alongside the upheavals of the previous century.Only three years after it was first publish and in the heights of WW2 this movie was very relevant upon debut. Set on the mountains between Madrid and Segovia, Robert Jordan, the reflection of Hemingway himself or shell I say his alter ago, joins a group of insurgents in the Fascists side, together they show us the complicity of war, while everyone need to choose their side whereas opinions and creed sometime prove us that nothing can be black or white, add it the toughness of daily fighting and you get a fabulous story. Gary Cooper and Ingrid Bergman enshrined us that this movie will take us all the way to the path of glory, though, Katina Paxinou, as Pilar took the best supporting actress in the academy awards. As one of my favorite books I was more than looking forward to watch Sam Wood adaptation. The book influence was poignant, showing us the life of the simple soldiers in the Republic and criticise the high rank of the local Communist party and the Soviets in particular, it was banned in the Soviet Union for many years on. Unfortunately the movie doesn't show the political intrigue that eventually causes the Republic to loose the granting Franco decades of reign, instead the movie put it emphasis on the love story between American explosive expert, Robert Jordan (Cooper) and beautiful young comrade, Maria (Bergman). To my opinion, the movie took from the book it main objective, nevertheless the movie is worth watching and can be describe as good American love-drama.

    I'm currently studying the Spanish Civil War as told through the medium of cinema. I came across this film and with high expectations of a good story with fine acting I bought it from Amazon. How wrong can one be! If melodrama had a rating of one to ten and ten being the worst this would be nudging the ten. Apart from the fine acting of Gary Cooper, the rest of the cast were shameful. It seemed as if they were reading their lines from a board but had problems because they were semi-literate. Example: To-morr-ow we sha-ll go to the bri-dge. Oh dear! The only decent lines spoken in normal fashion were those by Katina Paxinou. Even the delightful Bergman was so far over the top she could have met herself coming back. And those gleaming teeth! The studio missed a golden opportunity. They could have inserted a sponsors speech bubble every so often. "Even in war you can have shiny teeth with new 'Gleemy-Teeth'. As for the war itself. A joke surely? Scant attention was given to anything political. I correct myself: no attention was given. Finally it can't be put down to: 'the films of the time' because lots of other films made in the same period were nowhere near as appalling - especially the war films. Bottom line. Hollywood has and always will be useless at making films about other countries wars. zero out of ten.

    To suggest, as a number of reviews have, that Cooper's acting is wooden is being polite. His words emanate like some parody of a person learning English for the first time, stoned, and in a casket. Granted, some of the lines he is given are terrible ("If I go, you go with me," and about 10 variations of this), but he is supposed to be an actor. At least, the others give some flair to their performance, but Coop was clueless. This is what happens when you get a Republican to play a Hemingway hero in the Spanish Civil War: a truly treasonous performance. As much as I like him in some pictures, such as High Noon, his acting or whatever you call it in FWTBT is deader than Monty Python's Norwegian Blue.

    For some reason I have developed a liking for Ernest Hemingway, the writer of For whom the bells tolls. His characters have the bravery and lack of fear (or is it manliness?), which I also enjoyed with for instance John Wayne. With regard to the intellectual content, I am less certain about the excellence of Hemingways narratives. Nevertheless, For whom the bell tolls is a true epic. And the Spanisch Civil War is an outstanding stage for the unfolding of a story. Here the people had chosen a government that originated from their own ranks. And when the conservative military tried to seize power, the people put up a resistance that was both heroic and long lasting. The fascist military got support from its allies in Italy and Germany, whereas the Republic was reinforced with International Brigades of all kinds (but with a dominance of Bolshevists). In the film we see an American professor, Roberto, who works as a saboteur for the Republican Peoples Army Headquarters. He is ordered to blow up a bridge in the Spanish mountains, as part of a republican offensive. Unlike many foreign fighters, during his quest Roberto is embedded in a group of Spanish partisans. The film is easily accessible, and is never boring, alth0ugh it contains no surprises. There are little political moments, and actually the film has been dubbed as one of the greatest romances. For Roberto yields to the intimate advances of a young girl named Maria. During the war her republican parents were killed and she herself was raped by the nationalists. It is evident that she is in great emotional anguish, which combines with an adolescent instability. What does Hemingway intend to express? The dialogs seem superficial and devoid of clues. So I guess Hemingway uses the whole entourage as a parable, just to reflect on the war itself. For although the Spanish Civil War has gained an image of social progress and human liberation, contemporary sources suggest that the society was still primitive and in the feudal stage. It may well be that the Spanish situation resembled the turmoil in Russia around 1917, that has been portrayed so skillfully in Doctor Zhivago. In fact the leader Pablo of the partisan group was responsible for the massacre of the nationalists in his own village. During the expedition Pablo murders a few partisans from another group, who had joined him in an attack on enemy positions. "I only care for my people", Pablo explains. It may well have been the experience of Hemingway himself, that the heraldic partisans were in fact simple farmers, who wanted to get rid of the land owners, and disliked anything outside of their field of vision. What appeared as anarchism was perhaps backwardness. Such a state of mind might explain the primitive cruelty of the war, as is portrayed in the film. Then the romance with Maria might represent Hemingways passion for the poor people of Spain. In the last scene, when Roberto prepares for the final battle, he ponders over his devotion. Is it towards America? Spain or the Republic? No, it is towards the desolate Maria. Anyway, I find the film recommendable. However, I definitely prefer the little-known film "Fuenf Patronenhuelsen", also about the Spanish Civil War, and even about a similar mission. You might also consider the Ivens documentary "The Spanish Earth", also with Hemingway. The Loach film "Land and Freedom" is also worth seeing. If you like social films in general, then have a look at my other reviews.

    This is an excellent adaptation of Ernest Heminway's novel. Paramount & the author were very happy with the film. It was nominated for Best Picture & 8 Oscars all told. Yet when the 1943 awards were handed out, this movie only received a Best Supporting Actress & that in spite of the big budget color feature this was. The busy cast of this movie is quite an accomplishment in itself. Gary Cooper & Ingrid Bergman were shooting Saratoga Trunk this year too though that movie would not be released until a couple of years later. They came to this movie at Paramount almost straight from their work at Warner Brothers. Sam Wood who directs this one also directed them in Saratoga Trunk. These 3 working together so soon should have really provided the spark. What happened is now legend. While over at Warner Brothers, before doing Saratoga Trunk, Bergman did a little assembly line black & white picture with Humphrey Bogart known as Casablanca. That little black & white film which Bergman did not particularly like, trumped this movie at the awards. Even the great writing of Ernest Hemingway could not beat the day to day writing of some lesser known assembly line writers of the other picture. It is interesting how in this color feature, Gary Cooper looks younger & better than he does in the black & white Saratoga Trunk where he looks older. Maybe he had a bad make-up man in that film? This is a mystery. Bergman looks great in every movie. Imagine though in a short span of three years, Bergman works in two Sam Wood movies, does SpellBound with Alfred Hitchcock, & yet today is most remembered for the movie she liked the least, Casablanca. The irony of this just shows how life can achieve greatness by accident. If Bergman had skipped the Bogart film, you wonder what the result of these other fine works she did would be. In For Whom The Bell Tolls, Bergman is just as fine with Cooper as she is in Saratoga Trunk, though Trunk is more of Ingrid's Gone With The Wind Performance. Sam Wood is a fine Director, who did a good variety of films. While these Cooper-Bergman films are an accomplishment, his most remembered directing effort today might just be that comedy known as A Night At The Opera. Just imagine Wood's resume without that crown jewel though this effort is outstanding. The Bell Tolls for thee,& since these people answered the bell, they have a lot of good work. Imagine Gary Cooper's career without High Noon, which is really his crown jewel. Once again, this is an excellent film, still it has not been the crown jewel of anybodies career except for Ernest Hemingway. It is the best screen play of his best novel.

    Howard Hawks had a saying that a good movie was three great scenes and no bad ones. For this movie, I would change that to; a great movie has three noticeably excellent elements, and nothing below average. And even by that standard, this movie falls just short of being great. By the one hour mark you've begun to notice an accumulation of better-than-average conceits (A wife puts her husband in his place and confiscates his power, Ingrid Bergman in the sleeping bag, a stand out performance by Katina Paxinou, some excellent photography) but problems lay ahead. First, the good: The cinematography is above average. It occasionally offers a stunning visual (a horse bucking against a snow drift, a two-shot of Cooper peering from a rock with a strange, expressionist tree limb over his head). Occasionally some frames look like a Japanese print. And the darkness of the shoot in some places produces stunning results. They probably shot dark to disguise that a lot of the outside scenes are shot inside, but it produces a unique, inky look I've never seen anywhere else. The Technicolor process in more conventional scenes looks deeply weird. The palette is very drained: forest green, gray, beige, brown flesh. But I kept thinking "if this was shot in b&w, there's no way it could have the impact of these strange color visuals" (Heresy, I know, but then of course it turns out to have been shot in Technicolor). But only the compositions are good. The film has a real lack of camera work to contribute to moments that should be heightened; the camera just kinda sits there for the whole movie. It seems they assumed one rock looks pretty much like every other rock so why move the camera. The blowing of the bridge (you know, the exciting part of the movie) is shot pretty dull. It's just kinda off in the distance (an obvious miniature) and half of it falls over. Without a great ending, you really don't have a great movie. Gary Cooper (like Warren Beatty) relies on understatement so much that when he's asked to deliver the films emotional climax, he just can't bring it. It feels hollow and a little pathetic. Each time he tries to sell it, it just sounds more vapid. ("You're me now. I am you. We both go ...You're me too! ...We're not apart... Take care of our life ...Shes going on, with me") Ugh. He can't put that malarkey over. You just can't ask Cooper to be deep or to articulate deep convictions (See the Fountainhead, Meet John Doe). True to Hemingway's reductivist style, we know the plot is about blowing up a bridge very early, but it still takes 3 hours to get there. I can see why people go the extra mile to forgive it faults, and declare it a masterpiece. But it doesn't take a genius to see that the problems of two little people don't amount to a hill of beans when a war is waging. The movie really failed to make me care about the affair which eats up miles of celluloid. Bergman is inappropriately "movie-star cute" while hiding out with a team of rebels defending her homeland. Pilar (Paxionu) is always more compelling than the couple. Anyone who likes the big love theme in the score can not have heard the tune "Let's Face the Music and Dance." Every time it played, I thought. 'How could they not know this melody makes people think of Fred and Ginger dancing around a swanky New York nightclub?'

    I think this movie was uneven, and not very interesting at all until the end. THAT, though, was magnificent! It was also a pity that Cooper had to wear that silly, ugly hat almost all the time; it destroyed his looks so much! Ingrid Bergman was very beautiful, but her very strong Swedish accent and typical Swedish looks were totally wrong for her part. It seemed a little odd, also, that Maria was so smiling and happy all the time - when she had gone through such an awful experience as a gang bang recently. The woman playing Pilar was wonderful though - strange that I had not even heard of her before. I did not like the ageism. I mean when Pilar, who was of Robert Jordan's age (at least the actors playing them were of the same age), talked about herself as an old woman, and seemed to think that it was a matter of course that it was Jordan and the very young Maria who should become a couple. That no one could love _her_ anymore, when she was only 43... It was difficult to understand what the war was all about, and who the waring parties were. But I read now that the filmmakers did this on purpose - for political reasons. But the worst thing was, that the movie did not feel like "Hemingway". It could have been any action story.

    Cooper gets his just deserts for poking his nose into someone else's war. Bergman keeps whittering on about her cropped hair, not appreciating that she looks much better with short cropped hair . Cooper and Bergman should have rented a motel room in Madrid and saved us all two and a half hours of rubbish. Over the top relationship hijacked the film despite Ingrid looking cute. If the film had been 90 minutes long without the dire music, it could have been worthwhile. At least they gave the Oscar to right person although Pablo also turned in a decent performance. Despite Pablo and Ingrid being fond of the horses, they did not seem to mind when several were shot in combat. No anti-piracy or advertising films thank goodness. Packaging quotes Variety as saying this is one of the most important films of all time ! I conclude Variety has a sense of humour or needs to watch a few more films

As much as I like him in some pictures, such as High Noon, his acting or whatever you call it in FWTBT is deader than Monty Python's Norwegian Blue.

    For some reason I have developed a liking for Ernest Hemingway, the writer of For whom the bells tolls. His characters have the bravery and lack of fear (or is it manliness?), which I also enjoyed with for instance John Wayne. With regard to the intellectual content, I am less certain about the excellence of Hemingways narratives. Nevertheless, For whom the bell tolls is a true epic. And the Spanisch Civil War is an outstanding stage for the unfolding of a story. Here the people had chosen a government that originated from their own ranks. And when the conservative military tried to seize power, the people put up a resistance that was both heroic and long lasting. The fascist military got support from its allies in Italy and Germany, whereas the Republic was reinforced with International Brigades of all kinds (but with a dominance of Bolshevists). In the film we see an American professor, Roberto, who works as a saboteur for the Republican Peoples Army Headquarters. He is ordered to blow up a bridge in the Spanish mountains, as part of a republican offensive. Unlike many foreign fighters, during his quest Roberto is embedded in a group of Spanish partisans. The film is easily accessible, and is never boring, alth0ugh it contains no surprises. There are little political moments, and actually the film has been dubbed as one of the greatest romances. For Roberto yields to the intimate advances of a young girl named Maria. During the war her republican parents were killed and she herself was raped by the nationalists. It is evident that she is in great emotional anguish, which combines with an adolescent instability. What does Hemingway intend to express? The dialogs seem superficial and devoid of clues. So I guess Hemingway uses the whole entourage as a parable, just to reflect on the war itself. For although the Spanish Civil War has gained an image of social progress and human liberation, contemporary sources suggest that the society was still primitive and in the feudal stage. It may well be that the Spanish situation resembled the turmoil in Russia around 1917, that has been portrayed so skillfully in Doctor Zhivago. In fact the leader Pablo of the partisan group was responsible for the massacre of the nationalists in his own village. During the expedition Pablo murders a few partisans from another group, who had joined him in an attack on enemy positions. "I only care for my people", Pablo explains. It may well have been the experience of Hemingway himself, that the heraldic partisans were in fact simple farmers, who wanted to get rid of the land owners, and disliked anything outside of their field of vision. What appeared as anarchism was perhaps backwardness. Such a state of mind might explain the primitive cruelty of the war, as is portrayed in the film. Then the romance with Maria might represent Hemingways passion for the poor people of Spain. In the last scene, when Roberto prepares for the final battle, he ponders over his devotion. Is it towards America? Spain or the Republic? No, it is towards the desolate Maria. Anyway, I find the film recommendable. However, I definitely prefer the little-known film "Fuenf Patronenhuelsen", also about the Spanish Civil War, and even about a similar mission. You might also consider the Ivens documentary "The Spanish Earth", also with Hemingway. The Loach film "Land and Freedom" is also worth seeing. If you like social films in general, then have a look at my other reviews.

    This is an excellent adaptation of Ernest Heminway's novel. Paramount & the author were very happy with the film. It was nominated for Best Picture & 8 Oscars all told. Yet when the 1943 awards were handed out, this movie only received a Best Supporting Actress & that in spite of the big budget color feature this was. The busy cast of this movie is quite an accomplishment in itself. Gary Cooper & Ingrid Bergman were shooting Saratoga Trunk this year too though that movie would not be released until a couple of years later. They came to this movie at Paramount almost straight from their work at Warner Brothers. Sam Wood who directs this one also directed them in Saratoga Trunk. These 3 working together so soon should have really provided the spark. What happened is now legend. While over at Warner Brothers, before doing Saratoga Trunk, Bergman did a little assembly line black & white picture with Humphrey Bogart known as Casablanca. That little black & white film which Bergman did not particularly like, trumped this movie at the awards. Even the great writing of Ernest Hemingway could not beat the day to day writing of some lesser known assembly line writers of the other picture. It is interesting how in this color feature, Gary Cooper looks younger & better than he does in the black & white Saratoga Trunk where he looks older. Maybe he had a bad make-up man in that film? This is a mystery. Bergman looks great in every movie. Imagine though in a short span of three years, Bergman works in two Sam Wood movies, does SpellBound with Alfred Hitchcock, & yet today is most remembered for the movie she liked the least, Casablanca. The irony of this just shows how life can achieve greatness by accident. If Bergman had skipped the Bogart film, you wonder what the result of these other fine works she did would be. In For Whom The Bell Tolls, Bergman is just as fine with Cooper as she is in Saratoga Trunk, though Trunk is more of Ingrid's Gone With The Wind Performance. Sam Wood is a fine Director, who did a good variety of films. While these Cooper-Bergman films are an accomplishment, his most remembered directing effort today might just be that comedy known as A Night At The Opera. Just imagine Wood's resume without that crown jewel though this effort is outstanding. The Bell Tolls for thee,& since these people answered the bell, they have a lot of good work. Imagine Gary Cooper's career without High Noon, which is really his crown jewel. Once again, this is an excellent film, still it has not been the crown jewel of anybodies career except for Ernest Hemingway. It is the best screen play of his best novel.

    Howard Hawks had a saying that a good movie was three great scenes and no bad ones. For this movie, I would change that to; a great movie has three noticeably excellent elements, and nothing below average. And even by that standard, this movie falls just short of being great. By the one hour mark you've begun to notice an accumulation of better-than-average conceits (A wife puts her husband in his place and confiscates his power, Ingrid Bergman in the sleeping bag, a stand out performance by Katina Paxinou, some excellent photography) but problems lay ahead. First, the good: The cinematography is above average. It occasionally offers a stunning visual (a horse bucking against a snow drift, a two-shot of Cooper peering from a rock with a strange, expressionist tree limb over his head). Occasionally some frames look like a Japanese print. And the darkness of the shoot in some places produces stunning results. They probably shot dark to disguise that a lot of the outside scenes are shot inside, but it produces a unique, inky look I've never seen anywhere else. The Technicolor process in more conventional scenes looks deeply weird. The palette is very drained: forest green, gray, beige, brown flesh. But I kept thinking "if this was shot in b&w, there's no way it could have the impact of these strange color visuals" (Heresy, I know, but then of course it turns out to have been shot in Technicolor). But only the compositions are good. The film has a real lack of camera work to contribute to moments that should be heightened; the camera just kinda sits there for the whole movie. It seems they assumed one rock looks pretty much like every other rock so why move the camera. The blowing of the bridge (you know, the exciting part of the movie) is shot pretty dull. It's just kinda off in the distance (an obvious miniature) and half of it falls over. Without a great ending, you really don't have a great movie. Gary Cooper (like Warren Beatty) relies on understatement so much that when he's asked to deliver the films emotional climax, he just can't bring it. It feels hollow and a little pathetic. Each time he tries to sell it, it just sounds more vapid. ("You're me now. I am you. We both go ...You're me too! ...We're not apart... Take care of our life ...Shes going on, with me") Ugh. He can't put that malarkey over. You just can't ask Cooper to be deep or to articulate deep convictions (See the Fountainhead, Meet John Doe). True to Hemingway's reductivist style, we know the plot is about blowing up a bridge very early, but it still takes 3 hours to get there. I can see why people go the extra mile to forgive it faults, and declare it a masterpiece. But it doesn't take a genius to see that the problems of two little people don't amount to a hill of beans when a war is waging. The movie really failed to make me care about the affair which eats up miles of celluloid. Bergman is inappropriately "movie-star cute" while hiding out with a team of rebels defending her homeland. Pilar (Paxionu) is always more compelling than the couple. Anyone who likes the big love theme in the score can not have heard the tune "Let's Face the Music and Dance." Every time it played, I thought. 'How could they not know this melody makes people think of Fred and Ginger dancing around a swanky New York nightclub?'

    I think this movie was uneven, and not very interesting at all until the end. THAT, though, was magnificent! It was also a pity that Cooper had to wear that silly, ugly hat almost all the time; it destroyed his looks so much! Ingrid Bergman was very beautiful, but her very strong Swedish accent and typical Swedish looks were totally wrong for her part. It seemed a little odd, also, that Maria was so smiling and happy all the time - when she had gone through such an awful experience as a gang bang recently. The woman playing Pilar was wonderful though - strange that I had not even heard of her before. I did not like the ageism. I mean when Pilar, who was of Robert Jordan's age (at least the actors playing them were of the same age), talked about herself as an old woman, and seemed to think that it was a matter of course that it was Jordan and the very young Maria who should become a couple. That no one could love _her_ anymore, when she was only 43... It was difficult to understand what the war was all about, and who the waring parties were. But I read now that the filmmakers did this on purpose - for political reasons. But the worst thing was, that the movie did not feel like "Hemingway". It could have been any action story.

    Cooper gets his just deserts for poking his nose into someone else's war. Bergman keeps whittering on about her cropped hair, not appreciating that she looks much better with short cropped hair . Cooper and Bergman should have rented a motel room in Madrid and saved us all two and a half hours of rubbish. Over the top relationship hijacked the film despite Ingrid looking cute. If the film had been 90 minutes long without the dire music, it could have been worthwhile. At least they gave the Oscar to right person although Pablo also turned in a decent performance. Despite Pablo and Ingrid being fond of the horses, they did not seem to mind when several were shot in combat. No anti-piracy or advertising films thank goodness. Packaging quotes Variety as saying this is one of the most important films of all time ! I conclude Variety has a sense of humour or needs to watch a few more films

    As a Spaniard and a historian, I've always found this film deeply moving. Here in Spain, the films on our Civil War have become so common that, for youngest people, the war seems to be some kind of ancient mythology. This movie allows us to see how the Spanish War was perceived by other countries in contemporary dates. Actually, we cannot forget its importance as a test for WWII. Maria's life remind me of the stories that my grandma used to tell. Men went to war, but women were often ravaged by the winner army as revenge. What really amazes me is the lack of awareness that many people have on my country and their audacity on showing it. I think that's the effect of decades of Mexican actors playing Spaniards in Hollywood films. As a blonde, pale skinned, Caucasian woman, as the majority of my compatriots (remember, we're Europeans), I think Bergman's appearance fits perfectly her part.

    The Spanish Civil war is a conflict that has seared itself upon the romantic idealist . It's good versus evil of fascists on one side and idealistic freedom fighters from all across the world fighting to save a democratic socialist Republic from the jackboot of Hitler , Mussolini and Franco . Of course much of this conflict has been romanticized . It's often forgotten that Joseph Stalin was supporting the Republican cause while following his own agenda and the leftists spent more time fighting amongst themselves rather than fighting the Falangists . Regardless of this I've always viewed it as good versus evil , an opinion reinforced by a conversation I once had with a Spanish workmate who was of " Marrano Converso " linage whose grandparents were murdered by the Franco regime . I told her gloomily that's the worst thing about the 21st Century - there's no crusades to go on , no chance of jumping on a plane and changing the world . Though later when I thought about it there is a modern day equivalent and that is young people joining the military in NATO countries knowing fine well they'll be serving in Afghanistan fighting against murderous jihadists . Was it not Orwell himself who described all tyrannies being " theocracies in nature " ? Perhaps idealism gets the better of me and I have grown out of it because the opening scene of FOR WHOM THE BELLS TOLL has stayed with me since childhood . Two freedom fighters blow up a train , make their escape only for one of them to be wounded and he begs his comrade to shoot him . It's an impressive scene though its impact is negated having been done so many times in other films . I guess this was probably the first time I'd seen this type of scene and that's why it stayed with me . The mind of a child is very impressionable and idealistic I'm afraid that my idealism towards this film has become somewhat revisionist after seeing it again as an adult. Not a lot happens in the movie which is composed of a handful of characters sitting on two or three sets of studio exteriors spouting clich&eacute;d melodramatic dialogue along with an annoying incidental score that never seems to go away . Interesting to note that the screenplay has most of its politics exercised and there's only one scene where the idealistic manly hero Robert Jordan played by Gary Cooper at his most wooden explaining the reason why he joined the good fight This means you're a watching a film lacking in scope . When I say nothing much happens I mean this literally . Some people might appreciate the set design or cinematography but the film concentrates on the romance between Jordan and Maria and Jordan's abrasive relationship with the band of Gypsies . There's very little sense of time and place and I had to keep reminding myself that it's set in Spain in 1937. It's also a film that is very static and dated even to fans of Classic Hollywood like myself and someone would do better reading George Orwell's Homage To Catalonia than watching this Hollywood melodrama

    For Whom the Bells Tolls is a thrilling novel and one of the most acclaimed books of the 20Th century. It depict very accurately the turmoil of Spain during the civil war alongside the upheavals of the previous century.Only three years after it was first publish and in the heights of WW2 this movie was very relevant upon debut. Set on the mountains between Madrid and Segovia, Robert Jordan, the reflection of Hemingway himself or shell I say his alter ago, joins a group of insurgents in the Fascists side, together they show us the complicity of war, while everyone need to choose their side whereas opinions and creed sometime prove us that nothing can be black or white, add it the toughness of daily fighting and you get a fabulous story. Gary Cooper and Ingrid Bergman enshrined us that this movie will take us all the way to the path of glory, though, Katina Paxinou, as Pilar took the best supporting actress in the academy awards. As one of my favorite books I was more than looking forward to watch Sam Wood adaptation. The book influence was poignant, showing us the life of the simple soldiers in the Republic and criticise the high rank of the local Communist party and the Soviets in particular, it was banned in the Soviet Union for many years on. Unfortunately the movie doesn't show the political intrigue that eventually causes the Republic to loose the granting Franco decades of reign, instead the movie put it emphasis on the love story between American explosive expert, Robert Jordan (Cooper) and beautiful young comrade, Maria (Bergman). To my opinion, the movie took from the book it main objective, nevertheless the movie is worth watching and can be describe as good American love-drama.

    I'm currently studying the Spanish Civil War as told through the medium of cinema. I came across this film and with high expectations of a good story with fine acting I bought it from Amazon. How wrong can one be! If melodrama had a rating of one to ten and ten being the worst this would be nudging the ten. Apart from the fine acting of Gary Cooper, the rest of the cast were shameful. It seemed as if they were reading their lines from a board but had problems because they were semi-literate. Example: To-morr-ow we sha-ll go to the bri-dge. Oh dear! The only decent lines spoken in normal fashion were those by Katina Paxinou. Even the delightful Bergman was so far over the top she could have met herself coming back. And those gleaming teeth! The studio missed a golden opportunity. They could have inserted a sponsors speech bubble every so often. "Even in war you can have shiny teeth with new 'Gleemy-Teeth'. As for the war itself. A joke surely? Scant attention was given to anything political. I correct myself: no attention was given. Finally it can't be put down to: 'the films of the time' because lots of other films made in the same period were nowhere near as appalling - especially the war films. Bottom line. Hollywood has and always will be useless at making films about other countries wars. zero out of ten.

    To suggest, as a number of reviews have, that Cooper's acting is wooden is being polite. His words emanate like some parody of a person learning English for the first time, stoned, and in a casket. Granted, some of the lines he is given are terrible ("If I go, you go with me," and about 10 variations of this), but he is supposed to be an actor. At least, the others give some flair to their performance, but Coop was clueless. This is what happens when you get a Republican to play a Hemingway hero in the Spanish Civil War: a truly treasonous performance. As much as I like him in some pictures, such as High Noon, his acting or whatever you call it in FWTBT is deader than Monty Python's Norwegian Blue.

I mean when Pilar, who was of Robert Jordan's age (at least the actors playing them were of the same age), talked about herself as an old woman, and seemed to think that it was a matter of course that it was Jordan and the very young Maria who should become a couple. That no one could love _her_ anymore, when she was only 43... It was difficult to understand what the war was all about, and who the waring parties were. But I read now that the filmmakers did this on purpose - for political reasons. But the worst thing was, that the movie did not feel like "Hemingway". It could have been any action story.

    Cooper gets his just deserts for poking his nose into someone else's war. Bergman keeps whittering on about her cropped hair, not appreciating that she looks much better with short cropped hair . Cooper and Bergman should have rented a motel room in Madrid and saved us all two and a half hours of rubbish. Over the top relationship hijacked the film despite Ingrid looking cute. If the film had been 90 minutes long without the dire music, it could have been worthwhile. At least they gave the Oscar to right person although Pablo also turned in a decent performance. Despite Pablo and Ingrid being fond of the horses, they did not seem to mind when several were shot in combat. No anti-piracy or advertising films thank goodness. Packaging quotes Variety as saying this is one of the most important films of all time ! I conclude Variety has a sense of humour or needs to watch a few more films

    As a Spaniard and a historian, I've always found this film deeply moving. Here in Spain, the films on our Civil War have become so common that, for youngest people, the war seems to be some kind of ancient mythology. This movie allows us to see how the Spanish War was perceived by other countries in contemporary dates. Actually, we cannot forget its importance as a test for WWII. Maria's life remind me of the stories that my grandma used to tell. Men went to war, but women were often ravaged by the winner army as revenge. What really amazes me is the lack of awareness that many people have on my country and their audacity on showing it. I think that's the effect of decades of Mexican actors playing Spaniards in Hollywood films. As a blonde, pale skinned, Caucasian woman, as the majority of my compatriots (remember, we're Europeans), I think Bergman's appearance fits perfectly her part.

    The Spanish Civil war is a conflict that has seared itself upon the romantic idealist . It's good versus evil of fascists on one side and idealistic freedom fighters from all across the world fighting to save a democratic socialist Republic from the jackboot of Hitler , Mussolini and Franco . Of course much of this conflict has been romanticized . It's often forgotten that Joseph Stalin was supporting the Republican cause while following his own agenda and the leftists spent more time fighting amongst themselves rather than fighting the Falangists . Regardless of this I've always viewed it as good versus evil , an opinion reinforced by a conversation I once had with a Spanish workmate who was of " Marrano Converso " linage whose grandparents were murdered by the Franco regime . I told her gloomily that's the worst thing about the 21st Century - there's no crusades to go on , no chance of jumping on a plane and changing the world . Though later when I thought about it there is a modern day equivalent and that is young people joining the military in NATO countries knowing fine well they'll be serving in Afghanistan fighting against murderous jihadists . Was it not Orwell himself who described all tyrannies being " theocracies in nature " ? Perhaps idealism gets the better of me and I have grown out of it because the opening scene of FOR WHOM THE BELLS TOLL has stayed with me since childhood . Two freedom fighters blow up a train , make their escape only for one of them to be wounded and he begs his comrade to shoot him . It's an impressive scene though its impact is negated having been done so many times in other films . I guess this was probably the first time I'd seen this type of scene and that's why it stayed with me . The mind of a child is very impressionable and idealistic I'm afraid that my idealism towards this film has become somewhat revisionist after seeing it again as an adult. Not a lot happens in the movie which is composed of a handful of characters sitting on two or three sets of studio exteriors spouting clich&eacute;d melodramatic dialogue along with an annoying incidental score that never seems to go away . Interesting to note that the screenplay has most of its politics exercised and there's only one scene where the idealistic manly hero Robert Jordan played by Gary Cooper at his most wooden explaining the reason why he joined the good fight This means you're a watching a film lacking in scope . When I say nothing much happens I mean this literally . Some people might appreciate the set design or cinematography but the film concentrates on the romance between Jordan and Maria and Jordan's abrasive relationship with the band of Gypsies . There's very little sense of time and place and I had to keep reminding myself that it's set in Spain in 1937. It's also a film that is very static and dated even to fans of Classic Hollywood like myself and someone would do better reading George Orwell's Homage To Catalonia than watching this Hollywood melodrama

    For Whom the Bells Tolls is a thrilling novel and one of the most acclaimed books of the 20Th century. It depict very accurately the turmoil of Spain during the civil war alongside the upheavals of the previous century.Only three years after it was first publish and in the heights of WW2 this movie was very relevant upon debut. Set on the mountains between Madrid and Segovia, Robert Jordan, the reflection of Hemingway himself or shell I say his alter ago, joins a group of insurgents in the Fascists side, together they show us the complicity of war, while everyone need to choose their side whereas opinions and creed sometime prove us that nothing can be black or white, add it the toughness of daily fighting and you get a fabulous story. Gary Cooper and Ingrid Bergman enshrined us that this movie will take us all the way to the path of glory, though, Katina Paxinou, as Pilar took the best supporting actress in the academy awards. As one of my favorite books I was more than looking forward to watch Sam Wood adaptation. The book influence was poignant, showing us the life of the simple soldiers in the Republic and criticise the high rank of the local Communist party and the Soviets in particular, it was banned in the Soviet Union for many years on. Unfortunately the movie doesn't show the political intrigue that eventually causes the Republic to loose the granting Franco decades of reign, instead the movie put it emphasis on the love story between American explosive expert, Robert Jordan (Cooper) and beautiful young comrade, Maria (Bergman). To my opinion, the movie took from the book it main objective, nevertheless the movie is worth watching and can be describe as good American love-drama.

    I'm currently studying the Spanish Civil War as told through the medium of cinema. I came across this film and with high expectations of a good story with fine acting I bought it from Amazon. How wrong can one be! If melodrama had a rating of one to ten and ten being the worst this would be nudging the ten. Apart from the fine acting of Gary Cooper, the rest of the cast were shameful. It seemed as if they were reading their lines from a board but had problems because they were semi-literate. Example: To-morr-ow we sha-ll go to the bri-dge. Oh dear! The only decent lines spoken in normal fashion were those by Katina Paxinou. Even the delightful Bergman was so far over the top she could have met herself coming back. And those gleaming teeth! The studio missed a golden opportunity. They could have inserted a sponsors speech bubble every so often. "Even in war you can have shiny teeth with new 'Gleemy-Teeth'. As for the war itself. A joke surely? Scant attention was given to anything political. I correct myself: no attention was given. Finally it can't be put down to: 'the films of the time' because lots of other films made in the same period were nowhere near as appalling - especially the war films. Bottom line. Hollywood has and always will be useless at making films about other countries wars. zero out of ten.

    To suggest, as a number of reviews have, that Cooper's acting is wooden is being polite. His words emanate like some parody of a person learning English for the first time, stoned, and in a casket. Granted, some of the lines he is given are terrible ("If I go, you go with me," and about 10 variations of this), but he is supposed to be an actor. At least, the others give some flair to their performance, but Coop was clueless. This is what happens when you get a Republican to play a Hemingway hero in the Spanish Civil War: a truly treasonous performance. As much as I like him in some pictures, such as High Noon, his acting or whatever you call it in FWTBT is deader than Monty Python's Norwegian Blue.

    For some reason I have developed a liking for Ernest Hemingway, the writer of For whom the bells tolls. His characters have the bravery and lack of fear (or is it manliness?), which I also enjoyed with for instance John Wayne. With regard to the intellectual content, I am less certain about the excellence of Hemingways narratives. Nevertheless, For whom the bell tolls is a true epic. And the Spanisch Civil War is an outstanding stage for the unfolding of a story. Here the people had chosen a government that originated from their own ranks. And when the conservative military tried to seize power, the people put up a resistance that was both heroic and long lasting. The fascist military got support from its allies in Italy and Germany, whereas the Republic was reinforced with International Brigades of all kinds (but with a dominance of Bolshevists). In the film we see an American professor, Roberto, who works as a saboteur for the Republican Peoples Army Headquarters. He is ordered to blow up a bridge in the Spanish mountains, as part of a republican offensive. Unlike many foreign fighters, during his quest Roberto is embedded in a group of Spanish partisans. The film is easily accessible, and is never boring, alth0ugh it contains no surprises. There are little political moments, and actually the film has been dubbed as one of the greatest romances. For Roberto yields to the intimate advances of a young girl named Maria. During the war her republican parents were killed and she herself was raped by the nationalists. It is evident that she is in great emotional anguish, which combines with an adolescent instability. What does Hemingway intend to express? The dialogs seem superficial and devoid of clues. So I guess Hemingway uses the whole entourage as a parable, just to reflect on the war itself. For although the Spanish Civil War has gained an image of social progress and human liberation, contemporary sources suggest that the society was still primitive and in the feudal stage. It may well be that the Spanish situation resembled the turmoil in Russia around 1917, that has been portrayed so skillfully in Doctor Zhivago. In fact the leader Pablo of the partisan group was responsible for the massacre of the nationalists in his own village. During the expedition Pablo murders a few partisans from another group, who had joined him in an attack on enemy positions. "I only care for my people", Pablo explains. It may well have been the experience of Hemingway himself, that the heraldic partisans were in fact simple farmers, who wanted to get rid of the land owners, and disliked anything outside of their field of vision. What appeared as anarchism was perhaps backwardness. Such a state of mind might explain the primitive cruelty of the war, as is portrayed in the film. Then the romance with Maria might represent Hemingways passion for the poor people of Spain. In the last scene, when Roberto prepares for the final battle, he ponders over his devotion. Is it towards America? Spain or the Republic? No, it is towards the desolate Maria. Anyway, I find the film recommendable. However, I definitely prefer the little-known film "Fuenf Patronenhuelsen", also about the Spanish Civil War, and even about a similar mission. You might also consider the Ivens documentary "The Spanish Earth", also with Hemingway. The Loach film "Land and Freedom" is also worth seeing. If you like social films in general, then have a look at my other reviews.

    This is an excellent adaptation of Ernest Heminway's novel. Paramount & the author were very happy with the film. It was nominated for Best Picture & 8 Oscars all told. Yet when the 1943 awards were handed out, this movie only received a Best Supporting Actress & that in spite of the big budget color feature this was. The busy cast of this movie is quite an accomplishment in itself. Gary Cooper & Ingrid Bergman were shooting Saratoga Trunk this year too though that movie would not be released until a couple of years later. They came to this movie at Paramount almost straight from their work at Warner Brothers. Sam Wood who directs this one also directed them in Saratoga Trunk. These 3 working together so soon should have really provided the spark. What happened is now legend. While over at Warner Brothers, before doing Saratoga Trunk, Bergman did a little assembly line black & white picture with Humphrey Bogart known as Casablanca. That little black & white film which Bergman did not particularly like, trumped this movie at the awards. Even the great writing of Ernest Hemingway could not beat the day to day writing of some lesser known assembly line writers of the other picture. It is interesting how in this color feature, Gary Cooper looks younger & better than he does in the black & white Saratoga Trunk where he looks older. Maybe he had a bad make-up man in that film? This is a mystery. Bergman looks great in every movie. Imagine though in a short span of three years, Bergman works in two Sam Wood movies, does SpellBound with Alfred Hitchcock, & yet today is most remembered for the movie she liked the least, Casablanca. The irony of this just shows how life can achieve greatness by accident. If Bergman had skipped the Bogart film, you wonder what the result of these other fine works she did would be. In For Whom The Bell Tolls, Bergman is just as fine with Cooper as she is in Saratoga Trunk, though Trunk is more of Ingrid's Gone With The Wind Performance. Sam Wood is a fine Director, who did a good variety of films. While these Cooper-Bergman films are an accomplishment, his most remembered directing effort today might just be that comedy known as A Night At The Opera. Just imagine Wood's resume without that crown jewel though this effort is outstanding. The Bell Tolls for thee,& since these people answered the bell, they have a lot of good work. Imagine Gary Cooper's career without High Noon, which is really his crown jewel. Once again, this is an excellent film, still it has not been the crown jewel of anybodies career except for Ernest Hemingway. It is the best screen play of his best novel.

    Howard Hawks had a saying that a good movie was three great scenes and no bad ones. For this movie, I would change that to; a great movie has three noticeably excellent elements, and nothing below average. And even by that standard, this movie falls just short of being great. By the one hour mark you've begun to notice an accumulation of better-than-average conceits (A wife puts her husband in his place and confiscates his power, Ingrid Bergman in the sleeping bag, a stand out performance by Katina Paxinou, some excellent photography) but problems lay ahead. First, the good: The cinematography is above average. It occasionally offers a stunning visual (a horse bucking against a snow drift, a two-shot of Cooper peering from a rock with a strange, expressionist tree limb over his head). Occasionally some frames look like a Japanese print. And the darkness of the shoot in some places produces stunning results. They probably shot dark to disguise that a lot of the outside scenes are shot inside, but it produces a unique, inky look I've never seen anywhere else. The Technicolor process in more conventional scenes looks deeply weird. The palette is very drained: forest green, gray, beige, brown flesh. But I kept thinking "if this was shot in b&w, there's no way it could have the impact of these strange color visuals" (Heresy, I know, but then of course it turns out to have been shot in Technicolor). But only the compositions are good. The film has a real lack of camera work to contribute to moments that should be heightened; the camera just kinda sits there for the whole movie. It seems they assumed one rock looks pretty much like every other rock so why move the camera. The blowing of the bridge (you know, the exciting part of the movie) is shot pretty dull. It's just kinda off in the distance (an obvious miniature) and half of it falls over. Without a great ending, you really don't have a great movie. Gary Cooper (like Warren Beatty) relies on understatement so much that when he's asked to deliver the films emotional climax, he just can't bring it. It feels hollow and a little pathetic. Each time he tries to sell it, it just sounds more vapid. ("You're me now. I am you. We both go ...You're me too! ...We're not apart... Take care of our life ...Shes going on, with me") Ugh. He can't put that malarkey over. You just can't ask Cooper to be deep or to articulate deep convictions (See the Fountainhead, Meet John Doe). True to Hemingway's reductivist style, we know the plot is about blowing up a bridge very early, but it still takes 3 hours to get there. I can see why people go the extra mile to forgive it faults, and declare it a masterpiece. But it doesn't take a genius to see that the problems of two little people don't amount to a hill of beans when a war is waging. The movie really failed to make me care about the affair which eats up miles of celluloid. Bergman is inappropriately "movie-star cute" while hiding out with a team of rebels defending her homeland. Pilar (Paxionu) is always more compelling than the couple. Anyone who likes the big love theme in the score can not have heard the tune "Let's Face the Music and Dance." Every time it played, I thought. 'How could they not know this melody makes people think of Fred and Ginger dancing around a swanky New York nightclub?'

    I think this movie was uneven, and not very interesting at all until the end. THAT, though, was magnificent! It was also a pity that Cooper had to wear that silly, ugly hat almost all the time; it destroyed his looks so much! Ingrid Bergman was very beautiful, but her very strong Swedish accent and typical Swedish looks were totally wrong for her part. It seemed a little odd, also, that Maria was so smiling and happy all the time - when she had gone through such an awful experience as a gang bang recently. The woman playing Pilar was wonderful though - strange that I had not even heard of her before. I did not like the ageism.

    For some reason I have developed a liking for Ernest Hemingway, the writer of For whom the bells tolls. His characters have the bravery and lack of fear (or is it manliness?), which I also enjoyed with for instance John Wayne. With regard to the intellectual content, I am less certain about the excellence of Hemingways narratives. Nevertheless, For whom the bell tolls is a true epic. And the Spanisch Civil War is an outstanding stage for the unfolding of a story. Here the people had chosen a government that originated from their own ranks. And when the conservative military tried to seize power, the people put up a resistance that was both heroic and long lasting. The fascist military got support from its allies in Italy and Germany, whereas the Republic was reinforced with International Brigades of all kinds (but with a dominance of Bolshevists). In the film we see an American professor, Roberto, who works as a saboteur for the Republican Peoples Army Headquarters. He is ordered to blow up a bridge in the Spanish mountains, as part of a republican offensive. Unlike many foreign fighters, during his quest Roberto is embedded in a group of Spanish partisans. The film is easily accessible, and is never boring, alth0ugh it contains no surprises. There are little political moments, and actually the film has been dubbed as one of the greatest romances. For Roberto yields to the intimate advances of a young girl named Maria. During the war her republican parents were killed and she herself was raped by the nationalists. It is evident that she is in great emotional anguish, which combines with an adolescent instability. What does Hemingway intend to express? The dialogs seem superficial and devoid of clues. So I guess Hemingway uses the whole entourage as a parable, just to reflect on the war itself. For although the Spanish Civil War has gained an image of social progress and human liberation, contemporary sources suggest that the society was still primitive and in the feudal stage. It may well be that the Spanish situation resembled the turmoil in Russia around 1917, that has been portrayed so skillfully in Doctor Zhivago. In fact the leader Pablo of the partisan group was responsible for the massacre of the nationalists in his own village. During the expedition Pablo murders a few partisans from another group, who had joined him in an attack on enemy positions. "I only care for my people", Pablo explains. It may well have been the experience of Hemingway himself, that the heraldic partisans were in fact simple farmers, who wanted to get rid of the land owners, and disliked anything outside of their field of vision. What appeared as anarchism was perhaps backwardness. Such a state of mind might explain the primitive cruelty of the war, as is portrayed in the film. Then the romance with Maria might represent Hemingways passion for the poor people of Spain. In the last scene, when Roberto prepares for the final battle, he ponders over his devotion. Is it towards America? Spain or the Republic? No, it is towards the desolate Maria. Anyway, I find the film recommendable. However, I definitely prefer the little-known film "Fuenf Patronenhuelsen", also about the Spanish Civil War, and even about a similar mission. You might also consider the Ivens documentary "The Spanish Earth", also with Hemingway. The Loach film "Land and Freedom" is also worth seeing. If you like social films in general, then have a look at my other reviews.

    This is an excellent adaptation of Ernest Heminway's novel. Paramount & the author were very happy with the film. It was nominated for Best Picture & 8 Oscars all told. Yet when the 1943 awards were handed out, this movie only received a Best Supporting Actress & that in spite of the big budget color feature this was. The busy cast of this movie is quite an accomplishment in itself. Gary Cooper & Ingrid Bergman were shooting Saratoga Trunk this year too though that movie would not be released until a couple of years later. They came to this movie at Paramount almost straight from their work at Warner Brothers. Sam Wood who directs this one also directed them in Saratoga Trunk. These 3 working together so soon should have really provided the spark. What happened is now legend. While over at Warner Brothers, before doing Saratoga Trunk, Bergman did a little assembly line black & white picture with Humphrey Bogart known as Casablanca. That little black & white film which Bergman did not particularly like, trumped this movie at the awards. Even the great writing of Ernest Hemingway could not beat the day to day writing of some lesser known assembly line writers of the other picture. It is interesting how in this color feature, Gary Cooper looks younger & better than he does in the black & white Saratoga Trunk where he looks older. Maybe he had a bad make-up man in that film? This is a mystery. Bergman looks great in every movie. Imagine though in a short span of three years, Bergman works in two Sam Wood movies, does SpellBound with Alfred Hitchcock, & yet today is most remembered for the movie she liked the least, Casablanca. The irony of this just shows how life can achieve greatness by accident. If Bergman had skipped the Bogart film, you wonder what the result of these other fine works she did would be. In For Whom The Bell Tolls, Bergman is just as fine with Cooper as she is in Saratoga Trunk, though Trunk is more of Ingrid's Gone With The Wind Performance. Sam Wood is a fine Director, who did a good variety of films. While these Cooper-Bergman films are an accomplishment, his most remembered directing effort today might just be that comedy known as A Night At The Opera. Just imagine Wood's resume without that crown jewel though this effort is outstanding. The Bell Tolls for thee,& since these people answered the bell, they have a lot of good work. Imagine Gary Cooper's career without High Noon, which is really his crown jewel. Once again, this is an excellent film, still it has not been the crown jewel of anybodies career except for Ernest Hemingway. It is the best screen play of his best novel.

    Howard Hawks had a saying that a good movie was three great scenes and no bad ones. For this movie, I would change that to; a great movie has three noticeably excellent elements, and nothing below average. And even by that standard, this movie falls just short of being great. By the one hour mark you've begun to notice an accumulation of better-than-average conceits (A wife puts her husband in his place and confiscates his power, Ingrid Bergman in the sleeping bag, a stand out performance by Katina Paxinou, some excellent photography) but problems lay ahead. First, the good: The cinematography is above average. It occasionally offers a stunning visual (a horse bucking against a snow drift, a two-shot of Cooper peering from a rock with a strange, expressionist tree limb over his head). Occasionally some frames look like a Japanese print. And the darkness of the shoot in some places produces stunning results. They probably shot dark to disguise that a lot of the outside scenes are shot inside, but it produces a unique, inky look I've never seen anywhere else. The Technicolor process in more conventional scenes looks deeply weird. The palette is very drained: forest green, gray, beige, brown flesh. But I kept thinking "if this was shot in b&w, there's no way it could have the impact of these strange color visuals" (Heresy, I know, but then of course it turns out to have been shot in Technicolor). But only the compositions are good. The film has a real lack of camera work to contribute to moments that should be heightened; the camera just kinda sits there for the whole movie. It seems they assumed one rock looks pretty much like every other rock so why move the camera. The blowing of the bridge (you know, the exciting part of the movie) is shot pretty dull. It's just kinda off in the distance (an obvious miniature) and half of it falls over. Without a great ending, you really don't have a great movie. Gary Cooper (like Warren Beatty) relies on understatement so much that when he's asked to deliver the films emotional climax, he just can't bring it. It feels hollow and a little pathetic. Each time he tries to sell it, it just sounds more vapid. ("You're me now. I am you. We both go ...You're me too! ...We're not apart... Take care of our life ...Shes going on, with me") Ugh. He can't put that malarkey over. You just can't ask Cooper to be deep or to articulate deep convictions (See the Fountainhead, Meet John Doe). True to Hemingway's reductivist style, we know the plot is about blowing up a bridge very early, but it still takes 3 hours to get there. I can see why people go the extra mile to forgive it faults, and declare it a masterpiece. But it doesn't take a genius to see that the problems of two little people don't amount to a hill of beans when a war is waging. The movie really failed to make me care about the affair which eats up miles of celluloid. Bergman is inappropriately "movie-star cute" while hiding out with a team of rebels defending her homeland. Pilar (Paxionu) is always more compelling than the couple. Anyone who likes the big love theme in the score can not have heard the tune "Let's Face the Music and Dance." Every time it played, I thought. 'How could they not know this melody makes people think of Fred and Ginger dancing around a swanky New York nightclub?'

    I think this movie was uneven, and not very interesting at all until the end. THAT, though, was magnificent! It was also a pity that Cooper had to wear that silly, ugly hat almost all the time; it destroyed his looks so much! Ingrid Bergman was very beautiful, but her very strong Swedish accent and typical Swedish looks were totally wrong for her part. It seemed a little odd, also, that Maria was so smiling and happy all the time - when she had gone through such an awful experience as a gang bang recently. The woman playing Pilar was wonderful though - strange that I had not even heard of her before. I did not like the ageism. I mean when Pilar, who was of Robert Jordan's age (at least the actors playing them were of the same age), talked about herself as an old woman, and seemed to think that it was a matter of course that it was Jordan and the very young Maria who should become a couple. That no one could love _her_ anymore, when she was only 43... It was difficult to understand what the war was all about, and who the waring parties were. But I read now that the filmmakers did this on purpose - for political reasons. But the worst thing was, that the movie did not feel like "Hemingway". It could have been any action story.

    Cooper gets his just deserts for poking his nose into someone else's war. Bergman keeps whittering on about her cropped hair, not appreciating that she looks much better with short cropped hair . Cooper and Bergman should have rented a motel room in Madrid and saved us all two and a half hours of rubbish. Over the top relationship hijacked the film despite Ingrid looking cute. If the film had been 90 minutes long without the dire music, it could have been worthwhile. At least they gave the Oscar to right person although Pablo also turned in a decent performance. Despite Pablo and Ingrid being fond of the horses, they did not seem to mind when several were shot in combat. No anti-piracy or advertising films thank goodness. Packaging quotes Variety as saying this is one of the most important films of all time ! I conclude Variety has a sense of humour or needs to watch a few more films

    As a Spaniard and a historian, I've always found this film deeply moving. Here in Spain, the films on our Civil War have become so common that, for youngest people, the war seems to be some kind of ancient mythology. This movie allows us to see how the Spanish War was perceived by other countries in contemporary dates. Actually, we cannot forget its importance as a test for WWII. Maria's life remind me of the stories that my grandma used to tell. Men went to war, but women were often ravaged by the winner army as revenge. What really amazes me is the lack of awareness that many people have on my country and their audacity on showing it. I think that's the effect of decades of Mexican actors playing Spaniards in Hollywood films. As a blonde, pale skinned, Caucasian woman, as the majority of my compatriots (remember, we're Europeans), I think Bergman's appearance fits perfectly her part.

    The Spanish Civil war is a conflict that has seared itself upon the romantic idealist . It's good versus evil of fascists on one side and idealistic freedom fighters from all across the world fighting to save a democratic socialist Republic from the jackboot of Hitler , Mussolini and Franco . Of course much of this conflict has been romanticized . It's often forgotten that Joseph Stalin was supporting the Republican cause while following his own agenda and the leftists spent more time fighting amongst themselves rather than fighting the Falangists . Regardless of this I've always viewed it as good versus evil , an opinion reinforced by a conversation I once had with a Spanish workmate who was of " Marrano Converso " linage whose grandparents were murdered by the Franco regime . I told her gloomily that's the worst thing about the 21st Century - there's no crusades to go on , no chance of jumping on a plane and changing the world . Though later when I thought about it there is a modern day equivalent and that is young people joining the military in NATO countries knowing fine well they'll be serving in Afghanistan fighting against murderous jihadists . Was it not Orwell himself who described all tyrannies being " theocracies in nature " ? Perhaps idealism gets the better of me and I have grown out of it because the opening scene of FOR WHOM THE BELLS TOLL has stayed with me since childhood . Two freedom fighters blow up a train , make their escape only for one of them to be wounded and he begs his comrade to shoot him . It's an impressive scene though its impact is negated having been done so many times in other films . I guess this was probably the first time I'd seen this type of scene and that's why it stayed with me . The mind of a child is very impressionable and idealistic I'm afraid that my idealism towards this film has become somewhat revisionist after seeing it again as an adult. Not a lot happens in the movie which is composed of a handful of characters sitting on two or three sets of studio exteriors spouting clich&eacute;d melodramatic dialogue along with an annoying incidental score that never seems to go away . Interesting to note that the screenplay has most of its politics exercised and there's only one scene where the idealistic manly hero Robert Jordan played by Gary Cooper at his most wooden explaining the reason why he joined the good fight This means you're a watching a film lacking in scope . When I say nothing much happens I mean this literally . Some people might appreciate the set design or cinematography but the film concentrates on the romance between Jordan and Maria and Jordan's abrasive relationship with the band of Gypsies . There's very little sense of time and place and I had to keep reminding myself that it's set in Spain in 1937. It's also a film that is very static and dated even to fans of Classic Hollywood like myself and someone would do better reading George Orwell's Homage To Catalonia than watching this Hollywood melodrama

    For Whom the Bells Tolls is a thrilling novel and one of the most acclaimed books of the 20Th century. It depict very accurately the turmoil of Spain during the civil war alongside the upheavals of the previous century.Only three years after it was first publish and in the heights of WW2 this movie was very relevant upon debut. Set on the mountains between Madrid and Segovia, Robert Jordan, the reflection of Hemingway himself or shell I say his alter ago, joins a group of insurgents in the Fascists side, together they show us the complicity of war, while everyone need to choose their side whereas opinions and creed sometime prove us that nothing can be black or white, add it the toughness of daily fighting and you get a fabulous story. Gary Cooper and Ingrid Bergman enshrined us that this movie will take us all the way to the path of glory, though, Katina Paxinou, as Pilar took the best supporting actress in the academy awards. As one of my favorite books I was more than looking forward to watch Sam Wood adaptation. The book influence was poignant, showing us the life of the simple soldiers in the Republic and criticise the high rank of the local Communist party and the Soviets in particular, it was banned in the Soviet Union for many years on. Unfortunately the movie doesn't show the political intrigue that eventually causes the Republic to loose the granting Franco decades of reign, instead the movie put it emphasis on the love story between American explosive expert, Robert Jordan (Cooper) and beautiful young comrade, Maria (Bergman). To my opinion, the movie took from the book it main objective, nevertheless the movie is worth watching and can be describe as good American love-drama.

    I'm currently studying the Spanish Civil War as told through the medium of cinema. I came across this film and with high expectations of a good story with fine acting I bought it from Amazon. How wrong can one be! If melodrama had a rating of one to ten and ten being the worst this would be nudging the ten. Apart from the fine acting of Gary Cooper, the rest of the cast were shameful. It seemed as if they were reading their lines from a board but had problems because they were semi-literate. Example: To-morr-ow we sha-ll go to the bri-dge. Oh dear! The only decent lines spoken in normal fashion were those by Katina Paxinou. Even the delightful Bergman was so far over the top she could have met herself coming back. And those gleaming teeth! The studio missed a golden opportunity. They could have inserted a sponsors speech bubble every so often. "Even in war you can have shiny teeth with new 'Gleemy-Teeth'. As for the war itself. A joke surely? Scant attention was given to anything political. I correct myself: no attention was given. Finally it can't be put down to: 'the films of the time' because lots of other films made in the same period were nowhere near as appalling - especially the war films. Bottom line. Hollywood has and always will be useless at making films about other countries wars. zero out of ten.

    To suggest, as a number of reviews have, that Cooper's acting is wooden is being polite. His words emanate like some parody of a person learning English for the first time, stoned, and in a casket. Granted, some of the lines he is given are terrible ("If I go, you go with me," and about 10 variations of this), but he is supposed to be an actor. At least, the others give some flair to their performance, but Coop was clueless. This is what happens when you get a Republican to play a Hemingway hero in the Spanish Civil War: a truly treasonous performance. As much as I like him in some pictures, such as High Noon, his acting or whatever you call it in FWTBT is deader than Monty Python's Norwegian Blue.

    Cooper gets his just deserts for poking his nose into someone else's war. Bergman keeps whittering on about her cropped hair, not appreciating that she looks much better with short cropped hair . Cooper and Bergman should have rented a motel room in Madrid and saved us all two and a half hours of rubbish. Over the top relationship hijacked the film despite Ingrid looking cute. If the film had been 90 minutes long without the dire music, it could have been worthwhile. At least they gave the Oscar to right person although Pablo also turned in a decent performance. Despite Pablo and Ingrid being fond of the horses, they did not seem to mind when several were shot in combat. No anti-piracy or advertising films thank goodness. Packaging quotes Variety as saying this is one of the most important films of all time ! I conclude Variety has a sense of humour or needs to watch a few more films
