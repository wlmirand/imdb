    Good intentions don't always equal good results. Sometimes there's a kink in the machine and you end up with a dud. If one tried to add up the number of films made with good intentions, they'd have a real sore behind. One of the most famous film disasters is this piece by famed director Paul Verhoeven. Intended to be a study of the world of Vegas showgirls, what it really is is a beautiful train wreck. It's like a skin flick with high production values and an A list director and cast. It's a shame the film didn't turn out the way the filmmakers planned, but that doesn't mean it isn't still a great time. Pros: Cast does it's best with the material. Dynamite direction. Concept with potential. Great score. Gorgeous cinematography. Equally stunning sets and costumes. High camp factor. Flows at a good pace. Cons: A lot of awful dialogue. Shallow, clich&eacute; filled script. Final thoughts: Let's not sugarcoat it folks; 'Showgirls' was never going to win any Oscars. With a script this bad, it's a wonder it even made it to the big screen. That aside, it's one of the most enjoyable bad movies of our time. It's pretty to look at and provides a few chuckles. It's also disturbing at times and fortunately those scenes are not played for laughs. Watch it alone or with friends, but do yourself a favor and watch it. My rating: 4/5

    Is the only way I can describe Elizabeth Berkley's so-called acting in this film!. The acting plummets from the moment she pulls out a knife and gives her best angry face in the first two minutes, the acting gets so cheesy it makes Jedward look like a formidable act. I know I seem far too critical but seriously at times the acting gets THAT bad you start feeling awkward, about as awkward when you watch a film with your parents and a nude scene pops up. I just think that the whole film is ruined by Elizabeth's poor acting and cheesy child like mood swings and hissy fits. The dancing looks awful Elizabeth is constantly looking stiff, angry and robotic. If you're looking for a cheap B list movie and a bit of skin then this may be the film for you but be warned the painful part is having to sit through watching it.

    Showgirls might have been a bit better had been the strip-o-gram equivalent of "The Long Good Friday", that is to say a film about someone at the top whose world dramatically falls apart when they thought they'd conquered enough to have it all. As it is, the film is an eerie cocksure mess of a picture; a film embracing the idea of women selling one's body as an appropriate career and a film on the side of women treading the grounds of a Las Vegas stage in order to demean their gender. This is, of course, after providing us with a heartless tract on pro-plastic surgery wherein falsity and such are the answers to life and that you're yet to make it in life should you not be donning the bright, sexy, exotic turf of a Nevada stage. This is one of those awkward projects wherein which the film is rubbish, and we know it's rubbish, but the film in question DOESN'T. The film is about the entry to; the living in, as well as the consequent dominating of, a very specific realm within the American city of Las Vegas perpetrated by a woman named Nomi (Berkley) who's in her twenties. Looking to hitch a ride with just about anyone at the film's outset, the film makes a point to capture just how na&iuml;ve she is at when the guy with whom she journeys swipes her belongings and drives off again. You have to wonder what he thought was in there for him - maybe he thought the case was worth something. Prior to all this, they cruise into town and lay eyes on Vegas for the first time: "There she is (!)" utters the driver, insinuating a general feeling of awe at the lights and at what Vegas conveys. The city is practically glowing, radiating there in the night as this green-horn rumbles on in for the first time looking to make it in the world of dancing and entertainment. The fact Nomi is too trusting of the gentleman, and that she loses at a game of slots in a casino at this very early time in her tenure here, cements her status as being completely out of her depth. Cut to six weeks later, and Nomi is staying with a friend whom she has met in Molly (Ravera). Backstage at a Vegas show, Nomi falls in love with her surroundings; surroundings of which have already fallen in love with that of Cristal Connors (Gershon), the establishment's star showgirl whose changing room is set away from the general chaos of other's and can muster up very little emotion when offered a bouquet of flowers for a latest performance. Such is, one feels, the quantity of past offerings of this ilk born out of this on-going adulation that this reaction is induced. It is here Nomi truly desires to be, it is here Cristal truly desires to stay: there can only be one true showgirl and when they get off on a somewhat negative first foot, battle commences. The film is essentially a string of second unit dance routines wherein very little is on but an awful lot is on show. Ultimately, this does little to raise the film above the level of usual American blockbuster fare - tits and arse are merely standing in for explosions and stunts. There are a number of scenes set at a pole dancing club owned by Al Torres, a slimy character played by Robert Davi  the very place at which Nomi must work if she is to hone her trade and get anywhere near places such as where Connors resides as queen of the stage. It's no secret the film enjoys these scenes, so much so that instead of actually probing as to why it is women might do this sort of work, or desire to be a superstar within these fields in the first place, we are instead invited to watch on; to join the punters and leer. A measure of how all over the place the film truly is lies in one specific sequence, wherein Davi's character briefly re-enters the heroine's life to stop and say hello for a minute. The guy was always a creep, and she was happy to be rid of him; but the romanticised tone as he once again re-enters the frame would suggest he's not all that bad, and that we should ourselves have missed him. I don't think so. Another odd moment arrives during a selection process sequence, when a male individual has for him a row of potential female dancers lined up for them so that he may cast his eye across and deduce whether they're fit for what the job demands  a sort of eerie syncing up with, one assumes, how the likes of Berkley and Gershon landed the roles of Nomi and Connors in the first place. The difference is that within the diegetic world of the film, a creep is at the helm of the project. Whereas one can lay little blame at the door of Paul Verhoven - someone whose female characters in Total Recall and Basic Instinct have been fun; feisty and often sexually charged without requiring the presence of rotten exploitation. The fallacy seems to fall with the fact those films depicted men first and foremost, with the dangerous women in their lives causing a chaos and such at the worst of times. Showgirls is, in a sense, constructed as if a 'men's picture'; a tale of two people vying for supremacy within a domain that pours lavish upon the dominant force and shoves the others to the back. Where Aronofsky's 2011 piece "Black Swan" nailed the case study, Showgirls just ends up being what it is: an overly long chore stuck between being a contemplative mediation and a skin flick, a film which depicts women whilst systematically striking us as not knowing the first thing about them.

    In 1995 'Showgirls' was the most controversial movie to ever come out of Hollywood. It's entire subject value had eyebrows lifting everywhere. The theme itself was a lure to many boys and men to rush to the theatre halls. The MPAA had a difficult time in rating the movie due to it's high sexually graphic nature presentation. I for sure had never seen so many women roam around topless so casually in a movie. No commercial movie to that day had I ever seen nudity depicted in a casual manner. I assume not many directors had the courage to do what Paul Verhoeven had attempted. He surely set a new standard and trend for cinema. But is is unfortunate that this did not become a long term frenzy. Without a doubt he made a daring movie which has gone beyond the realms of conventional cinema. Many would regard it as a true classic. The reason for this being that no other movie has chartered this territory even in the past 15 years. Paul Verhoeven is a competent director. Prior to his career in Hollywood he made movies on the genre of war and erotic natured movies. However I would rate his Hollywood career being his best. His first 2 movies 'Robocop' and 'Total Recall' were sci-fi. After that he made the box office hit 'Basic Instinct'. It's a surprising transition to move from sci-fi to erotic thrillers. But I guess it proves his versatility. 'Showgirls' obviously happened due to the success of 'Basic Instinct'. His collaboration with writer Joe Esterharez returned to the screen in full glare. Joe is a great writer and has always projected the different views of female empowerment in his novels. However the one flaw with 'Showgirls' is the script. Joe's one complaint with the movie was that he felt that sex and nudity camouflaged the small details in his novel. This made the plot appear thin and vague. The audiences admired the movie less for the plot but appreciated Elizabeth Berkeley performance. Mario Kassar is the executive producer this time round and also produced 'Basic Instinct' too. 'Showgirls' does not manage to recreate the magic of 'Basic Instinct'. But both movies are are different and the same team perhaps felt that this would be a profitable venture. The director manages the theme very well. Being a originally a outsider from the industry, he has brought life in to the movie with his creative skills and individual knowledge. The movies central theme is on Las Vegas showgirls. Rather than giving the movie the title 'strippers', 'Showgirls' was more of a respectable title. Vegas is renowned for it's casinos and gambling industry and employs a large number of people. As well as being a tourist attraction, it is also a wealthy state. The movie does not intend on exposing the seedy side but rather concentrates on showing the journey of a woman who is enthusiastic to become a high level showgirl. Many people she encounters throughout the movie are self centred and manipulative, but her character too has many negative qualities. Elizabeth Berkeley gives an honest performance. Her dancing abilities and acting skills are at their highest potential. Her portrayal as a ambitious and ruthless individual is very convincing. However she is not entirely a selfish person. She possesses feelings and demands respect like others too. Her performance is very inspiring and the manner in which she carries herself on screen is very professional. SPOILERS Nomi Malone played by (Elizabeth Berkeley) hitches a ride to Las Vegas. Her intentions are clear from the outset. She aims to become a popular Showgirl. A clothes designer Gina Revere lets her stay with her in her trailer. After enquiring at a few clubs and strip bars, Nomi gets the opportunity to dance at the Cheetah club. Robert Davi is the manager. Without wasting any time she becomes a professional dancer and catches the attention of everybody including Zack (kyle Mullikan) the entertainment manager and Crystal Conner s) Gina Gershon. Later she becomes lucky and gets the opportunity to audition for a showgirl position at the Stardust Hotel. She realises that it is not too easy and to become a high class dancer is very competitive. Her first dance is based on a volcano theme show. She electrifies on stage and becomes the highlight and talk of the town immediately. She becomes the media and people's favourite instantly. After spending a intimate night with Zack, she receives the lead position in a show. This upsets Crystal and she threatens Zack. This creates a conflict between Crystal and Nomi. After the show Nomi pushes Crystal down a flight of steps. This secures her position in the long term and leads to better things. However her friend Gina has a horrid encounter with her idolised singer, which makes Nomi think twice about her career and what consequences may occur if associating with the wrong people. END OF SPOILER This is Paul Verhoeven's less intellectual movies, as the content level is low in contrast to his previous movies. He gives an alternate view of his understanding of the entertainment business in Las Vegas. Under the glossy interiors lies a world that is full of people that are self centred, selfish and corrupt. It is awkward that Nomi feels strange when others behave towards her in the same manner. I could not understand why Esteharez shows Nomi's struggle as being too simple. She had to too easy for her. But I was convinced with her Short term struggles and I'm sure that many women may be able to relate to her character. The movie progresses at a moderate rate but the second hour is more productive as Nomi's character develops in to a complex phase. There are many dance sequences in the movie. They are pictured on a extravagant level.

    A momentous task in my life is done - I have watched Showgirls- and I have to say it was better than I expected but still not worthy of more than 3 stars. Let's start off with the lead actress (Elizabeth Berkly). She is the worst I have seen. She had one facial expression, sucked at trying to be serious, and couldn't dance her way out of hell(lots of huffing and puffing). I didn't even think she was that good looking, she has a horse- face. She had no grace at all and looked ridiculous in her role. The lead character, Nomi , said she wasn't a whore but oh she really played the whore/slut card pretty darn well throughout the whole movie. Every single character seemed to blend together and was lifeless. Really, there were no stand-out characters, they all were one-dimensional and had less expression than a plastic Barbie doll. There was nothing genuine about anyone, they were just trashy, self-centered, sex egotists, and didn't have the slightest emotional appeal. Throwing in that Andrew Carter guy was a very bad mistake as he served no purpose in the film and the background on him was non-existent. He was a big jerk to begin with and when he said "I like your ass", he turned out to be just a dirty- minded scumbag who thinks of women as nothing more than something to grab onto and enjoy. At least he got his ass kicked by Nomi. Surprisingly, this movie proved to have some entertainment value, albeit in a different sort of way. Lots of sexy dancing and adult oriented behavior but other than that the movie seemed to drag on for more than its worth. The first time I saw the nudity and sexual scenes, I was like "Yeah, this movie isn't so bad" but then it started to be poured on and on, relentlessly, making it hard to watch. It's hard to appreciate the beauty of seeing some naked body parts on screen when you're almost seeing it the entire time. It should be treated as a reward for watching the film, that is built up to instead of making it look trashy and tasteless. Even for me it got to be kind of sickening to see all of those women walking around naked for a half hour. The plot was just plain stupid. Nomi, a drifter supposedly from New York, comes to Las Vegas wanting to become a dancer and has to climb the ladder and fight the odds to become a top Vegas showgirl. For what? Is she that trashy and desperate for a living that she has to resort to selling her body? And it was played out in even worse fashion. The jokes and humor in this film were crude and just plain unfunny. Who came up with "she looks better than a ten inch dick and you know it"? That ugly hoe popping her boobs out again and again was supposed to be funny? Terrible script and actors/actresses alike who were about as exciting and thoughtful as a glass of water. There were some highlights, if any, in this movie that seemed to hold up what was a essentially a piece of garbage film that I'll never see again. The dancing was sensational, and the Elvis-look- alike guy in the truck was cool...and...well...that's about it. The costume design was downright trashy and it seemed like every flashy dance scene had the women stripping off their clothes and being groped all over. Only a movie to see in your private time. This movie doesn't even deserve an NC-17 rating, if you even call this a "movie". It wouldn't even qualify as a good porn film. It was like a bunch of D-list actors thrown together who don't know where they are going or what to do. They just partied, danced and what not until it was over. There was no chemistry between any of the characters and the progression of getting to know any of them was lackluster. There is so much more wrong with this film but that would probably take a while to write about so I'm just going to say this movie should not be on anyone's wish list. It is the movie that should be banned all across the world (and space if there are civilizations out there). Guard your sons, guard your daughters, this movie is the god of everything terrible and an example of bad-movie making to learn from. A trashy film that even landfills would be scared of. Why it spawned a sequel, I have no clue.

    Showgirls (1995) ** (out of 4) Paul Verhoeven's seriously intended but ultimate disaster about a young woman (Elizabeth Berkley) who arrives in Las Vegas with dreams of becoming a dancer but soon realizes the ugliness behind it. I've never found SHOWGIRLS to be the complete disaster that most people make it out to be. The reason for that is the film is simply way too boring to fit the "so bad it's good" range but at the same time there's no question that this thing contains some of the dumbest stuff you're ever going to see. How on Earth writer Joe Eszterhas ever expecting anyone to take this serious is beyond me because his screenplay has so many problems. For starters, it's basically just a poorly written remake of ALL ABOUT EVE and to make matters worse there's not a single second where you actually feel like you're getting a behind-the-scenes look at Vegas. Another problem is that the main character he wrote is so unlikeable that how are we supposed to care what happens to her? The first sequence with her alone is bad enough but then they follow it up with her going crazy on someone trying to help her. We then see her go off on countless others because she doesn't get what she wants and she just comes across as a psychotic brat and you certainly don't enjoy spending time with her. Then, another problem, is Berkley who just doesn't have the acting talent to pull the role off. I'm not sure a vet could have made this character work but when you still someone like Berkley into it it just becomes all the more bad. Not for a second did you ever feel her in the role and she certainly never brought it to life. Gina Gershon is certainly the best thing in the film but supporting players Kyle MacLachlan, Glenn Plummer and Robert Davi come off good as well. I think SHOWGIRLS would have worked much better had the filmmakers not taken it so serious. They shot for the Moon but came up well short and this here is where the majority of the laughs come from. This isn't one of the worst movies ever made but when 95% of your running time has naked women and it's still not erotic then that there should send a red flag up.

    You know, I'm a film buff and I've seen a lot of movies and I strongly claim that Showgirls is better than %80 of them. First of all it has a straight and fast-narrated story. Believe me, that's where most movies start to lag. The story begins from the very first scene and we learn that a girl in a shortage of money has come to Vegas to find a job as a dancer. This theme has an initial suspense in it which the script never lets it to fall down. Yet some may be bored by the dance scenes but personally I love dance and gaps made by dance sequences in films. From Godard's Band Apart which influenced the dance scene In Pulp Fiction to the Travolta's nice moves in Saturday Night Fever which is also an underrated film. Plus the group dances and choreographies are so fancy and erotic in Showgirls. My favorite one is when two main female characters participate on a stage show and the rivalry between them turns the dance moves into a sort of battle. About the eroticism in the movie, I think this is the aspect which has made everybody to give this title a low rating. But I really don't see Showgirl as a mere erotic picture. It has a story-teller script. The naked scenes are parts of the story. They are a part of the everyday life of characters and the environment surrounding them. Actually here is the point we can speak about the realism in the movie. Showgirls is a realistic movie, it's like a mirror that reflects the true hierarchy and competitions in the night club industry. But the kind of realism is not like Italian or French realism, it's Hollywoodian Realism. It does entertain you while giving you shocking facts about the subject. There are some great movies with similarities to Showgirls. First of all consider "All about Eve", which was made in 1950 about the replacement of generations and rivalry among the Theatre superstars. Some say Showgirls is a remake of All about Eve in a modern entertainment industry like Vegas show business. But personally I don't agree with them, the characteristics of two main female Characters in these movies are different. Another close film to our topic is "Casino" made by M.Scorsese at the same year that Showgirls was produced. Both pictures are made in Las Vegas in splendid and fancy sets and locations, and both have an intensive plot concerned with cruel industries. The irony is that Casino was celebrated by critics and nominated for several awards whereas Showgirls was deemed trash and a worthless sexual fantasy. I think it has the name of Scorsese as the director its reception was different. Although some figures like Tarantino have applauded the movie. "Boogie Nights" by Paul Thomas Anderson is also near to showgirls. It was shot 2 years after Paul Verhoeven's movie and I don't know whether Anderson had seen the other movie or not but if you like Boogie Nights I strongly recommend you to see Showgirls.

    "Who do you have to **** to get off this picture?" --attributed to Bette Davis Who did Elizabeth Berkley have to **** to get starred in "Showgirls"? The movie seems intended as a love letter to her, though I don't recall anyone in the 1990's saying, "Remember Jessie from 'Saved by the Bell'? God, I wish they'd get her into a porno flick so we could see what she's got!" What Berkley's got in "Showgirls" is a more explicit version of her petulance routine from that Saturday morning teen show. Berkley plays Nomi, a girl essentially from nowhere who wants to become a dancer. (And I do mean from nowhere. She has no family whatsoever, and later in the movie, another character has to explain to her what an M.B.A. is.) For no good reason, Nomi decides that becoming a dancer involves hitchhiking to Las Vegas. From that point, the script goes into two major loops. One is that, in one form or another, all the major characters have an obsession with either Nomi's dancing or her breasts. Either Nomi's being told how beautiful her chest is, or she's being told how much raw talent she has as a dancer. I don't know from Las Vegas, but having seen a few dancers and a few breasts in my day, my frank assessment is that Berkley is not outstanding in either department. The other loop is that Nomi is forever either showing off every inch of her lithe body or doing her best to simulate the sex act, only to go running off in anger every time somebody insinuates that she's a hooker. Now, where would anyone get that idea (other than her mentors requesting that she ice up her nipples before every show)? The movie's main, er, thrust is that Nomi works her way up to being a dancer in a show featuring what we're told is Vegas' star attraction, Cristal Connors (Gina Gershon). Eventually, we're told that Cristal has designs on Nomi, mainly so that screenwriter Joe Eszterhas and director Paul Verhoeven (the same enlightened team behind "Basic Instinct") can indulge their lip-smackin' woman-on-woman fantasies. From there, the movie goes into a hyper, NC-17 variation of "All About Eve," or what it would be if Bette Davis and Ann Baxter decided to get it on before they went into career damage control. Despite this movie's seedy reputation, it's not fun enough to be a "good" bad movie. It does have some Ed Wood-like dialogue whoppers -- when Nomi's old boss sees her hit the big time, he blithely comments, "It must be strange not to have someone c*** on you" -- but not enough to sit through this slop. Mostly, the movie makes you wonder how it dragged in actors such as Kyle MacLachlan, "L.A. Law's" Alan Rachins, and most notoriously, Gina Gershon who, with her big breasts and monotone line readings, comes off like Adrienne Barbeau's big sister.

    In a word: eeeeeew. This film will make you ashamed. Or at least it really, really should. One star is given with the word (awful) as an indicator - this film is exactly that - awful. What life itself cannot prepare you for is just how awful this is. Not only does everyone spend more time with their clothes off than on, there is a sadistically nasty streak to the whole thing - including a particularly nasty rape - that sucks all the joy and silliness out of it. I finally got around to watching it having avoided it for the best part of 20 years and now understand why that avoidance was a good thing. It is seriously one of the most utterly appalling films ever made and shows that it is possible to spend millions of dollars on nothing. I will never ever ever watch it again - it's not ironic, or cultic or anything. Just gave this reviewer chills as to how this project ever got greenlighted in the first place. I will not be watching the sequel either. A film only for desperately sad men.

    Sweet little Jesse Spano left the hole-some television series "Shaved By The Bell" in its last season to shave her snatch and dance around nakey for all to see. 22 yo Elizabeth Berkely has no problem waving her 22 yo box around for all of us in this touching story about strippers, cocaine, and a prostitute crackhead trying to turn over a new leaf in Sin City. HBO made an edited version that cuts out much of the story, and even more of her skin, so make sure to get the nasty NC-17 version that is hotter than a Havana Omelette on a dirty blonde's dirty butt-thole. Does the name Penny ring a bell for some reason? This 10 star slit-flick gets my gyno going' each and every time. The flacid jerk-off from "Sex and the City" that Charlotte marries gets a piece of 'ole Jesse, butt we don't mind, she's only about 10,000 times hotter and nastier than that ice-box Charlotte, and she'll kick your ass tunnel at the same time...uh oh, don't wanna give away too much of the goods at once - but that never stopped Elizabeth! Take my advice and come over to the girl-side; yes, yes, let the juice flow through you.

    Good intentions don't always equal good results. Sometimes there's a kink in the machine and you end up with a dud. If one tried to add up the number of films made with good intentions, they'd have a real sore behind. One of the most famous film disasters is this piece by famed director Paul Verhoeven. Intended to be a study of the world of Vegas showgirls, what it really is is a beautiful train wreck. It's like a skin flick with high production values and an A list director and cast. It's a shame the film didn't turn out the way the filmmakers planned, but that doesn't mean it isn't still a great time. Pros: Cast does it's best with the material. Dynamite direction. Concept with potential. Great score. Gorgeous cinematography. Equally stunning sets and costumes. High camp factor. Flows at a good pace. Cons: A lot of awful dialogue. Shallow, clich&eacute; filled script. Final thoughts: Let's not sugarcoat it folks; 'Showgirls' was never going to win any Oscars. With a script this bad, it's a wonder it even made it to the big screen. That aside, it's one of the most enjoyable bad movies of our time. It's pretty to look at and provides a few chuckles. It's also disturbing at times and fortunately those scenes are not played for laughs. Watch it alone or with friends, but do yourself a favor and watch it. My rating: 4/5

    Is the only way I can describe Elizabeth Berkley's so-called acting in this film!. The acting plummets from the moment she pulls out a knife and gives her best angry face in the first two minutes, the acting gets so cheesy it makes Jedward look like a formidable act. I know I seem far too critical but seriously at times the acting gets THAT bad you start feeling awkward, about as awkward when you watch a film with your parents and a nude scene pops up. I just think that the whole film is ruined by Elizabeth's poor acting and cheesy child like mood swings and hissy fits. The dancing looks awful Elizabeth is constantly looking stiff, angry and robotic. If you're looking for a cheap B list movie and a bit of skin then this may be the film for you but be warned the painful part is having to sit through watching it.

    Showgirls might have been a bit better had been the strip-o-gram equivalent of "The Long Good Friday", that is to say a film about someone at the top whose world dramatically falls apart when they thought they'd conquered enough to have it all. As it is, the film is an eerie cocksure mess of a picture; a film embracing the idea of women selling one's body as an appropriate career and a film on the side of women treading the grounds of a Las Vegas stage in order to demean their gender. This is, of course, after providing us with a heartless tract on pro-plastic surgery wherein falsity and such are the answers to life and that you're yet to make it in life should you not be donning the bright, sexy, exotic turf of a Nevada stage. This is one of those awkward projects wherein which the film is rubbish, and we know it's rubbish, but the film in question DOESN'T. The film is about the entry to; the living in, as well as the consequent dominating of, a very specific realm within the American city of Las Vegas perpetrated by a woman named Nomi (Berkley) who's in her twenties. Looking to hitch a ride with just about anyone at the film's outset, the film makes a point to capture just how na&iuml;ve she is at when the guy with whom she journeys swipes her belongings and drives off again. You have to wonder what he thought was in there for him - maybe he thought the case was worth something. Prior to all this, they cruise into town and lay eyes on Vegas for the first time: "There she is (!)" utters the driver, insinuating a general feeling of awe at the lights and at what Vegas conveys. The city is practically glowing, radiating there in the night as this green-horn rumbles on in for the first time looking to make it in the world of dancing and entertainment. The fact Nomi is too trusting of the gentleman, and that she loses at a game of slots in a casino at this very early time in her tenure here, cements her status as being completely out of her depth. Cut to six weeks later, and Nomi is staying with a friend whom she has met in Molly (Ravera). Backstage at a Vegas show, Nomi falls in love with her surroundings; surroundings of which have already fallen in love with that of Cristal Connors (Gershon), the establishment's star showgirl whose changing room is set away from the general chaos of other's and can muster up very little emotion when offered a bouquet of flowers for a latest performance. Such is, one feels, the quantity of past offerings of this ilk born out of this on-going adulation that this reaction is induced. It is here Nomi truly desires to be, it is here Cristal truly desires to stay: there can only be one true showgirl and when they get off on a somewhat negative first foot, battle commences. The film is essentially a string of second unit dance routines wherein very little is on but an awful lot is on show. Ultimately, this does little to raise the film above the level of usual American blockbuster fare - tits and arse are merely standing in for explosions and stunts. There are a number of scenes set at a pole dancing club owned by Al Torres, a slimy character played by Robert Davi  the very place at which Nomi must work if she is to hone her trade and get anywhere near places such as where Connors resides as queen of the stage. It's no secret the film enjoys these scenes, so much so that instead of actually probing as to why it is women might do this sort of work, or desire to be a superstar within these fields in the first place, we are instead invited to watch on; to join the punters and leer. A measure of how all over the place the film truly is lies in one specific sequence, wherein Davi's character briefly re-enters the heroine's life to stop and say hello for a minute. The guy was always a creep, and she was happy to be rid of him; but the romanticised tone as he once again re-enters the frame would suggest he's not all that bad, and that we should ourselves have missed him. I don't think so. Another odd moment arrives during a selection process sequence, when a male individual has for him a row of potential female dancers lined up for them so that he may cast his eye across and deduce whether they're fit for what the job demands  a sort of eerie syncing up with, one assumes, how the likes of Berkley and Gershon landed the roles of Nomi and Connors in the first place. The difference is that within the diegetic world of the film, a creep is at the helm of the project. Whereas one can lay little blame at the door of Paul Verhoven - someone whose female characters in Total Recall and Basic Instinct have been fun; feisty and often sexually charged without requiring the presence of rotten exploitation. The fallacy seems to fall with the fact those films depicted men first and foremost, with the dangerous women in their lives causing a chaos and such at the worst of times. Showgirls is, in a sense, constructed as if a 'men's picture'; a tale of two people vying for supremacy within a domain that pours lavish upon the dominant force and shoves the others to the back. Where Aronofsky's 2011 piece "Black Swan" nailed the case study, Showgirls just ends up being what it is: an overly long chore stuck between being a contemplative mediation and a skin flick, a film which depicts women whilst systematically striking us as not knowing the first thing about them.

    In 1995 'Showgirls' was the most controversial movie to ever come out of Hollywood. It's entire subject value had eyebrows lifting everywhere. The theme itself was a lure to many boys and men to rush to the theatre halls. The MPAA had a difficult time in rating the movie due to it's high sexually graphic nature presentation. I for sure had never seen so many women roam around topless so casually in a movie. No commercial movie to that day had I ever seen nudity depicted in a casual manner. I assume not many directors had the courage to do what Paul Verhoeven had attempted. He surely set a new standard and trend for cinema. But is is unfortunate that this did not become a long term frenzy. Without a doubt he made a daring movie which has gone beyond the realms of conventional cinema. Many would regard it as a true classic. The reason for this being that no other movie has chartered this territory even in the past 15 years. Paul Verhoeven is a competent director. Prior to his career in Hollywood he made movies on the genre of war and erotic natured movies. However I would rate his Hollywood career being his best. His first 2 movies 'Robocop' and 'Total Recall' were sci-fi. After that he made the box office hit 'Basic Instinct'. It's a surprising transition to move from sci-fi to erotic thrillers. But I guess it proves his versatility. 'Showgirls' obviously happened due to the success of 'Basic Instinct'. His collaboration with writer Joe Esterharez returned to the screen in full glare. Joe is a great writer and has always projected the different views of female empowerment in his novels. However the one flaw with 'Showgirls' is the script. Joe's one complaint with the movie was that he felt that sex and nudity camouflaged the small details in his novel. This made the plot appear thin and vague. The audiences admired the movie less for the plot but appreciated Elizabeth Berkeley performance. Mario Kassar is the executive producer this time round and also produced 'Basic Instinct' too. 'Showgirls' does not manage to recreate the magic of 'Basic Instinct'. But both movies are are different and the same team perhaps felt that this would be a profitable venture. The director manages the theme very well. Being a originally a outsider from the industry, he has brought life in to the movie with his creative skills and individual knowledge. The movies central theme is on Las Vegas showgirls. Rather than giving the movie the title 'strippers', 'Showgirls' was more of a respectable title. Vegas is renowned for it's casinos and gambling industry and employs a large number of people. As well as being a tourist attraction, it is also a wealthy state. The movie does not intend on exposing the seedy side but rather concentrates on showing the journey of a woman who is enthusiastic to become a high level showgirl. Many people she encounters throughout the movie are self centred and manipulative, but her character too has many negative qualities. Elizabeth Berkeley gives an honest performance. Her dancing abilities and acting skills are at their highest potential. Her portrayal as a ambitious and ruthless individual is very convincing. However she is not entirely a selfish person. She possesses feelings and demands respect like others too. Her performance is very inspiring and the manner in which she carries herself on screen is very professional. SPOILERS Nomi Malone played by (Elizabeth Berkeley) hitches a ride to Las Vegas. Her intentions are clear from the outset. She aims to become a popular Showgirl. A clothes designer Gina Revere lets her stay with her in her trailer. After enquiring at a few clubs and strip bars, Nomi gets the opportunity to dance at the Cheetah club. Robert Davi is the manager. Without wasting any time she becomes a professional dancer and catches the attention of everybody including Zack (kyle Mullikan) the entertainment manager and Crystal Conner s) Gina Gershon. Later she becomes lucky and gets the opportunity to audition for a showgirl position at the Stardust Hotel. She realises that it is not too easy and to become a high class dancer is very competitive. Her first dance is based on a volcano theme show. She electrifies on stage and becomes the highlight and talk of the town immediately. She becomes the media and people's favourite instantly. After spending a intimate night with Zack, she receives the lead position in a show. This upsets Crystal and she threatens Zack. This creates a conflict between Crystal and Nomi. After the show Nomi pushes Crystal down a flight of steps. This secures her position in the long term and leads to better things. However her friend Gina has a horrid encounter with her idolised singer, which makes Nomi think twice about her career and what consequences may occur if associating with the wrong people. END OF SPOILER This is Paul Verhoeven's less intellectual movies, as the content level is low in contrast to his previous movies. He gives an alternate view of his understanding of the entertainment business in Las Vegas. Under the glossy interiors lies a world that is full of people that are self centred, selfish and corrupt. It is awkward that Nomi feels strange when others behave towards her in the same manner. I could not understand why Esteharez shows Nomi's struggle as being too simple. She had to too easy for her. But I was convinced with her Short term struggles and I'm sure that many women may be able to relate to her character. The movie progresses at a moderate rate but the second hour is more productive as Nomi's character develops in to a complex phase. There are many dance sequences in the movie. They are pictured on a extravagant level.

    A momentous task in my life is done - I have watched Showgirls- and I have to say it was better than I expected but still not worthy of more than 3 stars. Let's start off with the lead actress (Elizabeth Berkly). She is the worst I have seen. She had one facial expression, sucked at trying to be serious, and couldn't dance her way out of hell(lots of huffing and puffing). I didn't even think she was that good looking, she has a horse- face. She had no grace at all and looked ridiculous in her role. The lead character, Nomi , said she wasn't a whore but oh she really played the whore/slut card pretty darn well throughout the whole movie. Every single character seemed to blend together and was lifeless. Really, there were no stand-out characters, they all were one-dimensional and had less expression than a plastic Barbie doll. There was nothing genuine about anyone, they were just trashy, self-centered, sex egotists, and didn't have the slightest emotional appeal. Throwing in that Andrew Carter guy was a very bad mistake as he served no purpose in the film and the background on him was non-existent. He was a big jerk to begin with and when he said "I like your ass", he turned out to be just a dirty- minded scumbag who thinks of women as nothing more than something to grab onto and enjoy. At least he got his ass kicked by Nomi. Surprisingly, this movie proved to have some entertainment value, albeit in a different sort of way. Lots of sexy dancing and adult oriented behavior but other than that the movie seemed to drag on for more than its worth. The first time I saw the nudity and sexual scenes, I was like "Yeah, this movie isn't so bad" but then it started to be poured on and on, relentlessly, making it hard to watch. It's hard to appreciate the beauty of seeing some naked body parts on screen when you're almost seeing it the entire time. It should be treated as a reward for watching the film, that is built up to instead of making it look trashy and tasteless. Even for me it got to be kind of sickening to see all of those women walking around naked for a half hour. The plot was just plain stupid. Nomi, a drifter supposedly from New York, comes to Las Vegas wanting to become a dancer and has to climb the ladder and fight the odds to become a top Vegas showgirl. For what? Is she that trashy and desperate for a living that she has to resort to selling her body? And it was played out in even worse fashion. The jokes and humor in this film were crude and just plain unfunny. Who came up with "she looks better than a ten inch dick and you know it"? That ugly hoe popping her boobs out again and again was supposed to be funny? Terrible script and actors/actresses alike who were about as exciting and thoughtful as a glass of water. There were some highlights, if any, in this movie that seemed to hold up what was a essentially a piece of garbage film that I'll never see again. The dancing was sensational, and the Elvis-look- alike guy in the truck was cool...and...well...that's about it. The costume design was downright trashy and it seemed like every flashy dance scene had the women stripping off their clothes and being groped all over. Only a movie to see in your private time. This movie doesn't even deserve an NC-17 rating, if you even call this a "movie". It wouldn't even qualify as a good porn film. It was like a bunch of D-list actors thrown together who don't know where they are going or what to do. They just partied, danced and what not until it was over. There was no chemistry between any of the characters and the progression of getting to know any of them was lackluster. There is so much more wrong with this film but that would probably take a while to write about so I'm just going to say this movie should not be on anyone's wish list. It is the movie that should be banned all across the world (and space if there are civilizations out there). Guard your sons, guard your daughters, this movie is the god of everything terrible and an example of bad-movie making to learn from. A trashy film that even landfills would be scared of. Why it spawned a sequel, I have no clue.

    Showgirls (1995) ** (out of 4) Paul Verhoeven's seriously intended but ultimate disaster about a young woman (Elizabeth Berkley) who arrives in Las Vegas with dreams of becoming a dancer but soon realizes the ugliness behind it. I've never found SHOWGIRLS to be the complete disaster that most people make it out to be. The reason for that is the film is simply way too boring to fit the "so bad it's good" range but at the same time there's no question that this thing contains some of the dumbest stuff you're ever going to see. How on Earth writer Joe Eszterhas ever expecting anyone to take this serious is beyond me because his screenplay has so many problems. For starters, it's basically just a poorly written remake of ALL ABOUT EVE and to make matters worse there's not a single second where you actually feel like you're getting a behind-the-scenes look at Vegas. Another problem is that the main character he wrote is so unlikeable that how are we supposed to care what happens to her? The first sequence with her alone is bad enough but then they follow it up with her going crazy on someone trying to help her. We then see her go off on countless others because she doesn't get what she wants and she just comes across as a psychotic brat and you certainly don't enjoy spending time with her. Then, another problem, is Berkley who just doesn't have the acting talent to pull the role off. I'm not sure a vet could have made this character work but when you still someone like Berkley into it it just becomes all the more bad. Not for a second did you ever feel her in the role and she certainly never brought it to life. Gina Gershon is certainly the best thing in the film but supporting players Kyle MacLachlan, Glenn Plummer and Robert Davi come off good as well. I think SHOWGIRLS would have worked much better had the filmmakers not taken it so serious. They shot for the Moon but came up well short and this here is where the majority of the laughs come from. This isn't one of the worst movies ever made but when 95% of your running time has naked women and it's still not erotic then that there should send a red flag up.

    You know, I'm a film buff and I've seen a lot of movies and I strongly claim that Showgirls is better than %80 of them. First of all it has a straight and fast-narrated story. Believe me, that's where most movies start to lag. The story begins from the very first scene and we learn that a girl in a shortage of money has come to Vegas to find a job as a dancer. This theme has an initial suspense in it which the script never lets it to fall down. Yet some may be bored by the dance scenes but personally I love dance and gaps made by dance sequences in films. From Godard's Band Apart which influenced the dance scene In Pulp Fiction to the Travolta's nice moves in Saturday Night Fever which is also an underrated film. Plus the group dances and choreographies are so fancy and erotic in Showgirls. My favorite one is when two main female characters participate on a stage show and the rivalry between them turns the dance moves into a sort of battle. About the eroticism in the movie, I think this is the aspect which has made everybody to give this title a low rating. But I really don't see Showgirl as a mere erotic picture. It has a story-teller script. The naked scenes are parts of the story. They are a part of the everyday life of characters and the environment surrounding them. Actually here is the point we can speak about the realism in the movie. Showgirls is a realistic movie, it's like a mirror that reflects the true hierarchy and competitions in the night club industry. But the kind of realism is not like Italian or French realism, it's Hollywoodian Realism. It does entertain you while giving you shocking facts about the subject. There are some great movies with similarities to Showgirls. First of all consider "All about Eve", which was made in 1950 about the replacement of generations and rivalry among the Theatre superstars. Some say Showgirls is a remake of All about Eve in a modern entertainment industry like Vegas show business. But personally I don't agree with them, the characteristics of two main female Characters in these movies are different. Another close film to our topic is "Casino" made by M.Scorsese at the same year that Showgirls was produced. Both pictures are made in Las Vegas in splendid and fancy sets and locations, and both have an intensive plot concerned with cruel industries. The irony is that Casino was celebrated by critics and nominated for several awards whereas Showgirls was deemed trash and a worthless sexual fantasy. I think it has the name of Scorsese as the director its reception was different. Although some figures like Tarantino have applauded the movie. "Boogie Nights" by Paul Thomas Anderson is also near to showgirls. It was shot 2 years after Paul Verhoeven's movie and I don't know whether Anderson had seen the other movie or not but if you like Boogie Nights I strongly recommend you to see Showgirls.

    "Who do you have to **** to get off this picture?" --attributed to Bette Davis Who did Elizabeth Berkley have to **** to get starred in "Showgirls"? The movie seems intended as a love letter to her, though I don't recall anyone in the 1990's saying, "Remember Jessie from 'Saved by the Bell'? God, I wish they'd get her into a porno flick so we could see what she's got!" What Berkley's got in "Showgirls" is a more explicit version of her petulance routine from that Saturday morning teen show. Berkley plays Nomi, a girl essentially from nowhere who wants to become a dancer. (And I do mean from nowhere. She has no family whatsoever, and later in the movie, another character has to explain to her what an M.B.A. is.) For no good reason, Nomi decides that becoming a dancer involves hitchhiking to Las Vegas. From that point, the script goes into two major loops. One is that, in one form or another, all the major characters have an obsession with either Nomi's dancing or her breasts. Either Nomi's being told how beautiful her chest is, or she's being told how much raw talent she has as a dancer. I don't know from Las Vegas, but having seen a few dancers and a few breasts in my day, my frank assessment is that Berkley is not outstanding in either department. The other loop is that Nomi is forever either showing off every inch of her lithe body or doing her best to simulate the sex act, only to go running off in anger every time somebody insinuates that she's a hooker. Now, where would anyone get that idea (other than her mentors requesting that she ice up her nipples before every show)? The movie's main, er, thrust is that Nomi works her way up to being a dancer in a show featuring what we're told is Vegas' star attraction, Cristal Connors (Gina Gershon). Eventually, we're told that Cristal has designs on Nomi, mainly so that screenwriter Joe Eszterhas and director Paul Verhoeven (the same enlightened team behind "Basic Instinct") can indulge their lip-smackin' woman-on-woman fantasies. From there, the movie goes into a hyper, NC-17 variation of "All About Eve," or what it would be if Bette Davis and Ann Baxter decided to get it on before they went into career damage control. Despite this movie's seedy reputation, it's not fun enough to be a "good" bad movie. It does have some Ed Wood-like dialogue whoppers -- when Nomi's old boss sees her hit the big time, he blithely comments, "It must be strange not to have someone c*** on you" -- but not enough to sit through this slop. Mostly, the movie makes you wonder how it dragged in actors such as Kyle MacLachlan, "L.A. Law's" Alan Rachins, and most notoriously, Gina Gershon who, with her big breasts and monotone line readings, comes off like Adrienne Barbeau's big sister.

    In a word: eeeeeew. This film will make you ashamed. Or at least it really, really should. One star is given with the word (awful) as an indicator - this film is exactly that - awful. What life itself cannot prepare you for is just how awful this is. Not only does everyone spend more time with their clothes off than on, there is a sadistically nasty streak to the whole thing - including a particularly nasty rape - that sucks all the joy and silliness out of it. I finally got around to watching it having avoided it for the best part of 20 years and now understand why that avoidance was a good thing. It is seriously one of the most utterly appalling films ever made and shows that it is possible to spend millions of dollars on nothing. I will never ever ever watch it again - it's not ironic, or cultic or anything. Just gave this reviewer chills as to how this project ever got greenlighted in the first place. I will not be watching the sequel either. A film only for desperately sad men.

    Sweet little Jesse Spano left the hole-some television series "Shaved By The Bell" in its last season to shave her snatch and dance around nakey for all to see. 22 yo Elizabeth Berkely has no problem waving her 22 yo box around for all of us in this touching story about strippers, cocaine, and a prostitute crackhead trying to turn over a new leaf in Sin City. HBO made an edited version that cuts out much of the story, and even more of her skin, so make sure to get the nasty NC-17 version that is hotter than a Havana Omelette on a dirty blonde's dirty butt-thole. Does the name Penny ring a bell for some reason? This 10 star slit-flick gets my gyno going' each and every time. The flacid jerk-off from "Sex and the City" that Charlotte marries gets a piece of 'ole Jesse, butt we don't mind, she's only about 10,000 times hotter and nastier than that ice-box Charlotte, and she'll kick your ass tunnel at the same time...uh oh, don't wanna give away too much of the goods at once - but that never stopped Elizabeth! Take my advice and come over to the girl-side; yes, yes, let the juice flow through you.

    Good intentions don't always equal good results. Sometimes there's a kink in the machine and you end up with a dud. If one tried to add up the number of films made with good intentions, they'd have a real sore behind. One of the most famous film disasters is this piece by famed director Paul Verhoeven. Intended to be a study of the world of Vegas showgirls, what it really is is a beautiful train wreck. It's like a skin flick with high production values and an A list director and cast. It's a shame the film didn't turn out the way the filmmakers planned, but that doesn't mean it isn't still a great time. Pros: Cast does it's best with the material. Dynamite direction. Concept with potential. Great score. Gorgeous cinematography. Equally stunning sets and costumes. High camp factor. Flows at a good pace. Cons: A lot of awful dialogue. Shallow, clich&eacute; filled script. Final thoughts: Let's not sugarcoat it folks; 'Showgirls' was never going to win any Oscars. With a script this bad, it's a wonder it even made it to the big screen. That aside, it's one of the most enjoyable bad movies of our time. It's pretty to look at and provides a few chuckles. It's also disturbing at times and fortunately those scenes are not played for laughs. Watch it alone or with friends, but do yourself a favor and watch it. My rating: 4/5

    Is the only way I can describe Elizabeth Berkley's so-called acting in this film!. The acting plummets from the moment she pulls out a knife and gives her best angry face in the first two minutes, the acting gets so cheesy it makes Jedward look like a formidable act. I know I seem far too critical but seriously at times the acting gets THAT bad you start feeling awkward, about as awkward when you watch a film with your parents and a nude scene pops up. I just think that the whole film is ruined by Elizabeth's poor acting and cheesy child like mood swings and hissy fits. The dancing looks awful Elizabeth is constantly looking stiff, angry and robotic. If you're looking for a cheap B list movie and a bit of skin then this may be the film for you but be warned the painful part is having to sit through watching it.

    Showgirls might have been a bit better had been the strip-o-gram equivalent of "The Long Good Friday", that is to say a film about someone at the top whose world dramatically falls apart when they thought they'd conquered enough to have it all. As it is, the film is an eerie cocksure mess of a picture; a film embracing the idea of women selling one's body as an appropriate career and a film on the side of women treading the grounds of a Las Vegas stage in order to demean their gender. This is, of course, after providing us with a heartless tract on pro-plastic surgery wherein falsity and such are the answers to life and that you're yet to make it in life should you not be donning the bright, sexy, exotic turf of a Nevada stage. This is one of those awkward projects wherein which the film is rubbish, and we know it's rubbish, but the film in question DOESN'T. The film is about the entry to; the living in, as well as the consequent dominating of, a very specific realm within the American city of Las Vegas perpetrated by a woman named Nomi (Berkley) who's in her twenties. Looking to hitch a ride with just about anyone at the film's outset, the film makes a point to capture just how na&iuml;ve she is at when the guy with whom she journeys swipes her belongings and drives off again. You have to wonder what he thought was in there for him - maybe he thought the case was worth something. Prior to all this, they cruise into town and lay eyes on Vegas for the first time: "There she is (!)" utters the driver, insinuating a general feeling of awe at the lights and at what Vegas conveys. The city is practically glowing, radiating there in the night as this green-horn rumbles on in for the first time looking to make it in the world of dancing and entertainment. The fact Nomi is too trusting of the gentleman, and that she loses at a game of slots in a casino at this very early time in her tenure here, cements her status as being completely out of her depth. Cut to six weeks later, and Nomi is staying with a friend whom she has met in Molly (Ravera). Backstage at a Vegas show, Nomi falls in love with her surroundings; surroundings of which have already fallen in love with that of Cristal Connors (Gershon), the establishment's star showgirl whose changing room is set away from the general chaos of other's and can muster up very little emotion when offered a bouquet of flowers for a latest performance. Such is, one feels, the quantity of past offerings of this ilk born out of this on-going adulation that this reaction is induced. It is here Nomi truly desires to be, it is here Cristal truly desires to stay: there can only be one true showgirl and when they get off on a somewhat negative first foot, battle commences. The film is essentially a string of second unit dance routines wherein very little is on but an awful lot is on show. Ultimately, this does little to raise the film above the level of usual American blockbuster fare - tits and arse are merely standing in for explosions and stunts. There are a number of scenes set at a pole dancing club owned by Al Torres, a slimy character played by Robert Davi  the very place at which Nomi must work if she is to hone her trade and get anywhere near places such as where Connors resides as queen of the stage. It's no secret the film enjoys these scenes, so much so that instead of actually probing as to why it is women might do this sort of work, or desire to be a superstar within these fields in the first place, we are instead invited to watch on; to join the punters and leer. A measure of how all over the place the film truly is lies in one specific sequence, wherein Davi's character briefly re-enters the heroine's life to stop and say hello for a minute. The guy was always a creep, and she was happy to be rid of him; but the romanticised tone as he once again re-enters the frame would suggest he's not all that bad, and that we should ourselves have missed him. I don't think so. Another odd moment arrives during a selection process sequence, when a male individual has for him a row of potential female dancers lined up for them so that he may cast his eye across and deduce whether they're fit for what the job demands  a sort of eerie syncing up with, one assumes, how the likes of Berkley and Gershon landed the roles of Nomi and Connors in the first place. The difference is that within the diegetic world of the film, a creep is at the helm of the project. Whereas one can lay little blame at the door of Paul Verhoven - someone whose female characters in Total Recall and Basic Instinct have been fun; feisty and often sexually charged without requiring the presence of rotten exploitation. The fallacy seems to fall with the fact those films depicted men first and foremost, with the dangerous women in their lives causing a chaos and such at the worst of times. Showgirls is, in a sense, constructed as if a 'men's picture'; a tale of two people vying for supremacy within a domain that pours lavish upon the dominant force and shoves the others to the back. Where Aronofsky's 2011 piece "Black Swan" nailed the case study, Showgirls just ends up being what it is: an overly long chore stuck between being a contemplative mediation and a skin flick, a film which depicts women whilst systematically striking us as not knowing the first thing about them.

    In 1995 'Showgirls' was the most controversial movie to ever come out of Hollywood. It's entire subject value had eyebrows lifting everywhere. The theme itself was a lure to many boys and men to rush to the theatre halls. The MPAA had a difficult time in rating the movie due to it's high sexually graphic nature presentation. I for sure had never seen so many women roam around topless so casually in a movie. No commercial movie to that day had I ever seen nudity depicted in a casual manner. I assume not many directors had the courage to do what Paul Verhoeven had attempted. He surely set a new standard and trend for cinema. But is is unfortunate that this did not become a long term frenzy. Without a doubt he made a daring movie which has gone beyond the realms of conventional cinema. Many would regard it as a true classic. The reason for this being that no other movie has chartered this territory even in the past 15 years. Paul Verhoeven is a competent director. Prior to his career in Hollywood he made movies on the genre of war and erotic natured movies. However I would rate his Hollywood career being his best. His first 2 movies 'Robocop' and 'Total Recall' were sci-fi. After that he made the box office hit 'Basic Instinct'. It's a surprising transition to move from sci-fi to erotic thrillers. But I guess it proves his versatility. 'Showgirls' obviously happened due to the success of 'Basic Instinct'. His collaboration with writer Joe Esterharez returned to the screen in full glare. Joe is a great writer and has always projected the different views of female empowerment in his novels. However the one flaw with 'Showgirls' is the script. Joe's one complaint with the movie was that he felt that sex and nudity camouflaged the small details in his novel. This made the plot appear thin and vague. The audiences admired the movie less for the plot but appreciated Elizabeth Berkeley performance. Mario Kassar is the executive producer this time round and also produced 'Basic Instinct' too. 'Showgirls' does not manage to recreate the magic of 'Basic Instinct'. But both movies are are different and the same team perhaps felt that this would be a profitable venture. The director manages the theme very well. Being a originally a outsider from the industry, he has brought life in to the movie with his creative skills and individual knowledge. The movies central theme is on Las Vegas showgirls. Rather than giving the movie the title 'strippers', 'Showgirls' was more of a respectable title. Vegas is renowned for it's casinos and gambling industry and employs a large number of people. As well as being a tourist attraction, it is also a wealthy state. The movie does not intend on exposing the seedy side but rather concentrates on showing the journey of a woman who is enthusiastic to become a high level showgirl. Many people she encounters throughout the movie are self centred and manipulative, but her character too has many negative qualities. Elizabeth Berkeley gives an honest performance. Her dancing abilities and acting skills are at their highest potential. Her portrayal as a ambitious and ruthless individual is very convincing. However she is not entirely a selfish person. She possesses feelings and demands respect like others too. Her performance is very inspiring and the manner in which she carries herself on screen is very professional. SPOILERS Nomi Malone played by (Elizabeth Berkeley) hitches a ride to Las Vegas. Her intentions are clear from the outset. She aims to become a popular Showgirl. A clothes designer Gina Revere lets her stay with her in her trailer. After enquiring at a few clubs and strip bars, Nomi gets the opportunity to dance at the Cheetah club. Robert Davi is the manager. Without wasting any time she becomes a professional dancer and catches the attention of everybody including Zack (kyle Mullikan) the entertainment manager and Crystal Conner s) Gina Gershon. Later she becomes lucky and gets the opportunity to audition for a showgirl position at the Stardust Hotel. She realises that it is not too easy and to become a high class dancer is very competitive. Her first dance is based on a volcano theme show. She electrifies on stage and becomes the highlight and talk of the town immediately. She becomes the media and people's favourite instantly. After spending a intimate night with Zack, she receives the lead position in a show. This upsets Crystal and she threatens Zack. This creates a conflict between Crystal and Nomi. After the show Nomi pushes Crystal down a flight of steps. This secures her position in the long term and leads to better things. However her friend Gina has a horrid encounter with her idolised singer, which makes Nomi think twice about her career and what consequences may occur if associating with the wrong people. END OF SPOILER This is Paul Verhoeven's less intellectual movies, as the content level is low in contrast to his previous movies. He gives an alternate view of his understanding of the entertainment business in Las Vegas. Under the glossy interiors lies a world that is full of people that are self centred, selfish and corrupt. It is awkward that Nomi feels strange when others behave towards her in the same manner. I could not understand why Esteharez shows Nomi's struggle as being too simple. She had to too easy for her. But I was convinced with her Short term struggles and I'm sure that many women may be able to relate to her character. The movie progresses at a moderate rate but the second hour is more productive as Nomi's character develops in to a complex phase. There are many dance sequences in the movie. They are pictured on a extravagant level.

    A momentous task in my life is done - I have watched Showgirls- and I have to say it was better than I expected but still not worthy of more than 3 stars. Let's start off with the lead actress (Elizabeth Berkly). She is the worst I have seen. She had one facial expression, sucked at trying to be serious, and couldn't dance her way out of hell(lots of huffing and puffing). I didn't even think she was that good looking, she has a horse- face. She had no grace at all and looked ridiculous in her role. The lead character, Nomi , said she wasn't a whore but oh she really played the whore/slut card pretty darn well throughout the whole movie. Every single character seemed to blend together and was lifeless. Really, there were no stand-out characters, they all were one-dimensional and had less expression than a plastic Barbie doll. There was nothing genuine about anyone, they were just trashy, self-centered, sex egotists, and didn't have the slightest emotional appeal. Throwing in that Andrew Carter guy was a very bad mistake as he served no purpose in the film and the background on him was non-existent. He was a big jerk to begin with and when he said "I like your ass", he turned out to be just a dirty- minded scumbag who thinks of women as nothing more than something to grab onto and enjoy. At least he got his ass kicked by Nomi. Surprisingly, this movie proved to have some entertainment value, albeit in a different sort of way. Lots of sexy dancing and adult oriented behavior but other than that the movie seemed to drag on for more than its worth. The first time I saw the nudity and sexual scenes, I was like "Yeah, this movie isn't so bad" but then it started to be poured on and on, relentlessly, making it hard to watch. It's hard to appreciate the beauty of seeing some naked body parts on screen when you're almost seeing it the entire time. It should be treated as a reward for watching the film, that is built up to instead of making it look trashy and tasteless. Even for me it got to be kind of sickening to see all of those women walking around naked for a half hour. The plot was just plain stupid. Nomi, a drifter supposedly from New York, comes to Las Vegas wanting to become a dancer and has to climb the ladder and fight the odds to become a top Vegas showgirl. For what? Is she that trashy and desperate for a living that she has to resort to selling her body? And it was played out in even worse fashion. The jokes and humor in this film were crude and just plain unfunny. Who came up with "she looks better than a ten inch dick and you know it"? That ugly hoe popping her boobs out again and again was supposed to be funny? Terrible script and actors/actresses alike who were about as exciting and thoughtful as a glass of water. There were some highlights, if any, in this movie that seemed to hold up what was a essentially a piece of garbage film that I'll never see again. The dancing was sensational, and the Elvis-look- alike guy in the truck was cool...and...well...that's about it. The costume design was downright trashy and it seemed like every flashy dance scene had the women stripping off their clothes and being groped all over. Only a movie to see in your private time. This movie doesn't even deserve an NC-17 rating, if you even call this a "movie". It wouldn't even qualify as a good porn film. It was like a bunch of D-list actors thrown together who don't know where they are going or what to do. They just partied, danced and what not until it was over. There was no chemistry between any of the characters and the progression of getting to know any of them was lackluster. There is so much more wrong with this film but that would probably take a while to write about so I'm just going to say this movie should not be on anyone's wish list. It is the movie that should be banned all across the world (and space if there are civilizations out there). Guard your sons, guard your daughters, this movie is the god of everything terrible and an example of bad-movie making to learn from. A trashy film that even landfills would be scared of. Why it spawned a sequel, I have no clue.

    Showgirls (1995) ** (out of 4) Paul Verhoeven's seriously intended but ultimate disaster about a young woman (Elizabeth Berkley) who arrives in Las Vegas with dreams of becoming a dancer but soon realizes the ugliness behind it. I've never found SHOWGIRLS to be the complete disaster that most people make it out to be. The reason for that is the film is simply way too boring to fit the "so bad it's good" range but at the same time there's no question that this thing contains some of the dumbest stuff you're ever going to see. How on Earth writer Joe Eszterhas ever expecting anyone to take this serious is beyond me because his screenplay has so many problems. For starters, it's basically just a poorly written remake of ALL ABOUT EVE and to make matters worse there's not a single second where you actually feel like you're getting a behind-the-scenes look at Vegas. Another problem is that the main character he wrote is so unlikeable that how are we supposed to care what happens to her? The first sequence with her alone is bad enough but then they follow it up with her going crazy on someone trying to help her. We then see her go off on countless others because she doesn't get what she wants and she just comes across as a psychotic brat and you certainly don't enjoy spending time with her. Then, another problem, is Berkley who just doesn't have the acting talent to pull the role off. I'm not sure a vet could have made this character work but when you still someone like Berkley into it it just becomes all the more bad. Not for a second did you ever feel her in the role and she certainly never brought it to life. Gina Gershon is certainly the best thing in the film but supporting players Kyle MacLachlan, Glenn Plummer and Robert Davi come off good as well. I think SHOWGIRLS would have worked much better had the filmmakers not taken it so serious. They shot for the Moon but came up well short and this here is where the majority of the laughs come from. This isn't one of the worst movies ever made but when 95% of your running time has naked women and it's still not erotic then that there should send a red flag up.

    You know, I'm a film buff and I've seen a lot of movies and I strongly claim that Showgirls is better than %80 of them. First of all it has a straight and fast-narrated story. Believe me, that's where most movies start to lag. The story begins from the very first scene and we learn that a girl in a shortage of money has come to Vegas to find a job as a dancer. This theme has an initial suspense in it which the script never lets it to fall down. Yet some may be bored by the dance scenes but personally I love dance and gaps made by dance sequences in films. From Godard's Band Apart which influenced the dance scene In Pulp Fiction to the Travolta's nice moves in Saturday Night Fever which is also an underrated film. Plus the group dances and choreographies are so fancy and erotic in Showgirls. My favorite one is when two main female characters participate on a stage show and the rivalry between them turns the dance moves into a sort of battle. About the eroticism in the movie, I think this is the aspect which has made everybody to give this title a low rating. But I really don't see Showgirl as a mere erotic picture. It has a story-teller script. The naked scenes are parts of the story. They are a part of the everyday life of characters and the environment surrounding them. Actually here is the point we can speak about the realism in the movie. Showgirls is a realistic movie, it's like a mirror that reflects the true hierarchy and competitions in the night club industry. But the kind of realism is not like Italian or French realism, it's Hollywoodian Realism. It does entertain you while giving you shocking facts about the subject. There are some great movies with similarities to Showgirls. First of all consider "All about Eve", which was made in 1950 about the replacement of generations and rivalry among the Theatre superstars. Some say Showgirls is a remake of All about Eve in a modern entertainment industry like Vegas show business. But personally I don't agree with them, the characteristics of two main female Characters in these movies are different. Another close film to our topic is "Casino" made by M.Scorsese at the same year that Showgirls was produced. Both pictures are made in Las Vegas in splendid and fancy sets and locations, and both have an intensive plot concerned with cruel industries. The irony is that Casino was celebrated by critics and nominated for several awards whereas Showgirls was deemed trash and a worthless sexual fantasy. I think it has the name of Scorsese as the director its reception was different. Although some figures like Tarantino have applauded the movie. "Boogie Nights" by Paul Thomas Anderson is also near to showgirls. It was shot 2 years after Paul Verhoeven's movie and I don't know whether Anderson had seen the other movie or not but if you like Boogie Nights I strongly recommend you to see Showgirls.

    "Who do you have to **** to get off this picture?" --attributed to Bette Davis Who did Elizabeth Berkley have to **** to get starred in "Showgirls"? The movie seems intended as a love letter to her, though I don't recall anyone in the 1990's saying, "Remember Jessie from 'Saved by the Bell'? God, I wish they'd get her into a porno flick so we could see what she's got!" What Berkley's got in "Showgirls" is a more explicit version of her petulance routine from that Saturday morning teen show. Berkley plays Nomi, a girl essentially from nowhere who wants to become a dancer. (And I do mean from nowhere. She has no family whatsoever, and later in the movie, another character has to explain to her what an M.B.A. is.) For no good reason, Nomi decides that becoming a dancer involves hitchhiking to Las Vegas. From that point, the script goes into two major loops. One is that, in one form or another, all the major characters have an obsession with either Nomi's dancing or her breasts. Either Nomi's being told how beautiful her chest is, or she's being told how much raw talent she has as a dancer. I don't know from Las Vegas, but having seen a few dancers and a few breasts in my day, my frank assessment is that Berkley is not outstanding in either department. The other loop is that Nomi is forever either showing off every inch of her lithe body or doing her best to simulate the sex act, only to go running off in anger every time somebody insinuates that she's a hooker. Now, where would anyone get that idea (other than her mentors requesting that she ice up her nipples before every show)? The movie's main, er, thrust is that Nomi works her way up to being a dancer in a show featuring what we're told is Vegas' star attraction, Cristal Connors (Gina Gershon). Eventually, we're told that Cristal has designs on Nomi, mainly so that screenwriter Joe Eszterhas and director Paul Verhoeven (the same enlightened team behind "Basic Instinct") can indulge their lip-smackin' woman-on-woman fantasies. From there, the movie goes into a hyper, NC-17 variation of "All About Eve," or what it would be if Bette Davis and Ann Baxter decided to get it on before they went into career damage control. Despite this movie's seedy reputation, it's not fun enough to be a "good" bad movie. It does have some Ed Wood-like dialogue whoppers -- when Nomi's old boss sees her hit the big time, he blithely comments, "It must be strange not to have someone c*** on you" -- but not enough to sit through this slop. Mostly, the movie makes you wonder how it dragged in actors such as Kyle MacLachlan, "L.A. Law's" Alan Rachins, and most notoriously, Gina Gershon who, with her big breasts and monotone line readings, comes off like Adrienne Barbeau's big sister.

    In a word: eeeeeew. This film will make you ashamed. Or at least it really, really should. One star is given with the word (awful) as an indicator - this film is exactly that - awful. What life itself cannot prepare you for is just how awful this is. Not only does everyone spend more time with their clothes off than on, there is a sadistically nasty streak to the whole thing - including a particularly nasty rape - that sucks all the joy and silliness out of it. I finally got around to watching it having avoided it for the best part of 20 years and now understand why that avoidance was a good thing. It is seriously one of the most utterly appalling films ever made and shows that it is possible to spend millions of dollars on nothing. I will never ever ever watch it again - it's not ironic, or cultic or anything. Just gave this reviewer chills as to how this project ever got greenlighted in the first place. I will not be watching the sequel either. A film only for desperately sad men.

    Sweet little Jesse Spano left the hole-some television series "Shaved By The Bell" in its last season to shave her snatch and dance around nakey for all to see. 22 yo Elizabeth Berkely has no problem waving her 22 yo box around for all of us in this touching story about strippers, cocaine, and a prostitute crackhead trying to turn over a new leaf in Sin City. HBO made an edited version that cuts out much of the story, and even more of her skin, so make sure to get the nasty NC-17 version that is hotter than a Havana Omelette on a dirty blonde's dirty butt-thole. Does the name Penny ring a bell for some reason? This 10 star slit-flick gets my gyno going' each and every time. The flacid jerk-off from "Sex and the City" that Charlotte marries gets a piece of 'ole Jesse, butt we don't mind, she's only about 10,000 times hotter and nastier than that ice-box Charlotte, and she'll kick your ass tunnel at the same time...uh oh, don't wanna give away too much of the goods at once - but that never stopped Elizabeth! Take my advice and come over to the girl-side; yes, yes, let the juice flow through you.

    Good intentions don't always equal good results. Sometimes there's a kink in the machine and you end up with a dud. If one tried to add up the number of films made with good intentions, they'd have a real sore behind. One of the most famous film disasters is this piece by famed director Paul Verhoeven. Intended to be a study of the world of Vegas showgirls, what it really is is a beautiful train wreck. It's like a skin flick with high production values and an A list director and cast. It's a shame the film didn't turn out the way the filmmakers planned, but that doesn't mean it isn't still a great time. Pros: Cast does it's best with the material. Dynamite direction. Concept with potential. Great score. Gorgeous cinematography. Equally stunning sets and costumes. High camp factor. Flows at a good pace. Cons: A lot of awful dialogue. Shallow, clich&eacute; filled script. Final thoughts: Let's not sugarcoat it folks; 'Showgirls' was never going to win any Oscars. With a script this bad, it's a wonder it even made it to the big screen. That aside, it's one of the most enjoyable bad movies of our time. It's pretty to look at and provides a few chuckles. It's also disturbing at times and fortunately those scenes are not played for laughs. Watch it alone or with friends, but do yourself a favor and watch it. My rating: 4/5

    Is the only way I can describe Elizabeth Berkley's so-called acting in this film!. The acting plummets from the moment she pulls out a knife and gives her best angry face in the first two minutes, the acting gets so cheesy it makes Jedward look like a formidable act. I know I seem far too critical but seriously at times the acting gets THAT bad you start feeling awkward, about as awkward when you watch a film with your parents and a nude scene pops up. I just think that the whole film is ruined by Elizabeth's poor acting and cheesy child like mood swings and hissy fits. The dancing looks awful Elizabeth is constantly looking stiff, angry and robotic. If you're looking for a cheap B list movie and a bit of skin then this may be the film for you but be warned the painful part is having to sit through watching it.

    Showgirls might have been a bit better had been the strip-o-gram equivalent of "The Long Good Friday", that is to say a film about someone at the top whose world dramatically falls apart when they thought they'd conquered enough to have it all. As it is, the film is an eerie cocksure mess of a picture; a film embracing the idea of women selling one's body as an appropriate career and a film on the side of women treading the grounds of a Las Vegas stage in order to demean their gender. This is, of course, after providing us with a heartless tract on pro-plastic surgery wherein falsity and such are the answers to life and that you're yet to make it in life should you not be donning the bright, sexy, exotic turf of a Nevada stage. This is one of those awkward projects wherein which the film is rubbish, and we know it's rubbish, but the film in question DOESN'T. The film is about the entry to; the living in, as well as the consequent dominating of, a very specific realm within the American city of Las Vegas perpetrated by a woman named Nomi (Berkley) who's in her twenties. Looking to hitch a ride with just about anyone at the film's outset, the film makes a point to capture just how na&iuml;ve she is at when the guy with whom she journeys swipes her belongings and drives off again. You have to wonder what he thought was in there for him - maybe he thought the case was worth something. Prior to all this, they cruise into town and lay eyes on Vegas for the first time: "There she is (!)" utters the driver, insinuating a general feeling of awe at the lights and at what Vegas conveys. The city is practically glowing, radiating there in the night as this green-horn rumbles on in for the first time looking to make it in the world of dancing and entertainment. The fact Nomi is too trusting of the gentleman, and that she loses at a game of slots in a casino at this very early time in her tenure here, cements her status as being completely out of her depth. Cut to six weeks later, and Nomi is staying with a friend whom she has met in Molly (Ravera). Backstage at a Vegas show, Nomi falls in love with her surroundings; surroundings of which have already fallen in love with that of Cristal Connors (Gershon), the establishment's star showgirl whose changing room is set away from the general chaos of other's and can muster up very little emotion when offered a bouquet of flowers for a latest performance. Such is, one feels, the quantity of past offerings of this ilk born out of this on-going adulation that this reaction is induced. It is here Nomi truly desires to be, it is here Cristal truly desires to stay: there can only be one true showgirl and when they get off on a somewhat negative first foot, battle commences. The film is essentially a string of second unit dance routines wherein very little is on but an awful lot is on show. Ultimately, this does little to raise the film above the level of usual American blockbuster fare - tits and arse are merely standing in for explosions and stunts. There are a number of scenes set at a pole dancing club owned by Al Torres, a slimy character played by Robert Davi  the very place at which Nomi must work if she is to hone her trade and get anywhere near places such as where Connors resides as queen of the stage. It's no secret the film enjoys these scenes, so much so that instead of actually probing as to why it is women might do this sort of work, or desire to be a superstar within these fields in the first place, we are instead invited to watch on; to join the punters and leer. A measure of how all over the place the film truly is lies in one specific sequence, wherein Davi's character briefly re-enters the heroine's life to stop and say hello for a minute. The guy was always a creep, and she was happy to be rid of him; but the romanticised tone as he once again re-enters the frame would suggest he's not all that bad, and that we should ourselves have missed him. I don't think so. Another odd moment arrives during a selection process sequence, when a male individual has for him a row of potential female dancers lined up for them so that he may cast his eye across and deduce whether they're fit for what the job demands  a sort of eerie syncing up with, one assumes, how the likes of Berkley and Gershon landed the roles of Nomi and Connors in the first place. The difference is that within the diegetic world of the film, a creep is at the helm of the project. Whereas one can lay little blame at the door of Paul Verhoven - someone whose female characters in Total Recall and Basic Instinct have been fun; feisty and often sexually charged without requiring the presence of rotten exploitation. The fallacy seems to fall with the fact those films depicted men first and foremost, with the dangerous women in their lives causing a chaos and such at the worst of times. Showgirls is, in a sense, constructed as if a 'men's picture'; a tale of two people vying for supremacy within a domain that pours lavish upon the dominant force and shoves the others to the back. Where Aronofsky's 2011 piece "Black Swan" nailed the case study, Showgirls just ends up being what it is: an overly long chore stuck between being a contemplative mediation and a skin flick, a film which depicts women whilst systematically striking us as not knowing the first thing about them.

    In 1995 'Showgirls' was the most controversial movie to ever come out of Hollywood. It's entire subject value had eyebrows lifting everywhere. The theme itself was a lure to many boys and men to rush to the theatre halls. The MPAA had a difficult time in rating the movie due to it's high sexually graphic nature presentation. I for sure had never seen so many women roam around topless so casually in a movie. No commercial movie to that day had I ever seen nudity depicted in a casual manner. I assume not many directors had the courage to do what Paul Verhoeven had attempted. He surely set a new standard and trend for cinema. But is is unfortunate that this did not become a long term frenzy. Without a doubt he made a daring movie which has gone beyond the realms of conventional cinema. Many would regard it as a true classic. The reason for this being that no other movie has chartered this territory even in the past 15 years. Paul Verhoeven is a competent director. Prior to his career in Hollywood he made movies on the genre of war and erotic natured movies. However I would rate his Hollywood career being his best. His first 2 movies 'Robocop' and 'Total Recall' were sci-fi. After that he made the box office hit 'Basic Instinct'. It's a surprising transition to move from sci-fi to erotic thrillers. But I guess it proves his versatility. 'Showgirls' obviously happened due to the success of 'Basic Instinct'. His collaboration with writer Joe Esterharez returned to the screen in full glare. Joe is a great writer and has always projected the different views of female empowerment in his novels. However the one flaw with 'Showgirls' is the script. Joe's one complaint with the movie was that he felt that sex and nudity camouflaged the small details in his novel. This made the plot appear thin and vague. The audiences admired the movie less for the plot but appreciated Elizabeth Berkeley performance. Mario Kassar is the executive producer this time round and also produced 'Basic Instinct' too. 'Showgirls' does not manage to recreate the magic of 'Basic Instinct'. But both movies are are different and the same team perhaps felt that this would be a profitable venture. The director manages the theme very well. Being a originally a outsider from the industry, he has brought life in to the movie with his creative skills and individual knowledge. The movies central theme is on Las Vegas showgirls. Rather than giving the movie the title 'strippers', 'Showgirls' was more of a respectable title. Vegas is renowned for it's casinos and gambling industry and employs a large number of people. As well as being a tourist attraction, it is also a wealthy state. The movie does not intend on exposing the seedy side but rather concentrates on showing the journey of a woman who is enthusiastic to become a high level showgirl. Many people she encounters throughout the movie are self centred and manipulative, but her character too has many negative qualities. Elizabeth Berkeley gives an honest performance. Her dancing abilities and acting skills are at their highest potential. Her portrayal as a ambitious and ruthless individual is very convincing. However she is not entirely a selfish person. She possesses feelings and demands respect like others too. Her performance is very inspiring and the manner in which she carries herself on screen is very professional. SPOILERS Nomi Malone played by (Elizabeth Berkeley) hitches a ride to Las Vegas. Her intentions are clear from the outset. She aims to become a popular Showgirl. A clothes designer Gina Revere lets her stay with her in her trailer. After enquiring at a few clubs and strip bars, Nomi gets the opportunity to dance at the Cheetah club. Robert Davi is the manager. Without wasting any time she becomes a professional dancer and catches the attention of everybody including Zack (kyle Mullikan) the entertainment manager and Crystal Conner s) Gina Gershon. Later she becomes lucky and gets the opportunity to audition for a showgirl position at the Stardust Hotel. She realises that it is not too easy and to become a high class dancer is very competitive. Her first dance is based on a volcano theme show. She electrifies on stage and becomes the highlight and talk of the town immediately. She becomes the media and people's favourite instantly. After spending a intimate night with Zack, she receives the lead position in a show. This upsets Crystal and she threatens Zack. This creates a conflict between Crystal and Nomi. After the show Nomi pushes Crystal down a flight of steps. This secures her position in the long term and leads to better things. However her friend Gina has a horrid encounter with her idolised singer, which makes Nomi think twice about her career and what consequences may occur if associating with the wrong people. END OF SPOILER This is Paul Verhoeven's less intellectual movies, as the content level is low in contrast to his previous movies. He gives an alternate view of his understanding of the entertainment business in Las Vegas. Under the glossy interiors lies a world that is full of people that are self centred, selfish and corrupt. It is awkward that Nomi feels strange when others behave towards her in the same manner. I could not understand why Esteharez shows Nomi's struggle as being too simple. She had to too easy for her. But I was convinced with her Short term struggles and I'm sure that many women may be able to relate to her character. The movie progresses at a moderate rate but the second hour is more productive as Nomi's character develops in to a complex phase. There are many dance sequences in the movie. They are pictured on a extravagant level.

    A momentous task in my life is done - I have watched Showgirls- and I have to say it was better than I expected but still not worthy of more than 3 stars. Let's start off with the lead actress (Elizabeth Berkly). She is the worst I have seen. She had one facial expression, sucked at trying to be serious, and couldn't dance her way out of hell(lots of huffing and puffing). I didn't even think she was that good looking, she has a horse- face. She had no grace at all and looked ridiculous in her role. The lead character, Nomi , said she wasn't a whore but oh she really played the whore/slut card pretty darn well throughout the whole movie. Every single character seemed to blend together and was lifeless. Really, there were no stand-out characters, they all were one-dimensional and had less expression than a plastic Barbie doll. There was nothing genuine about anyone, they were just trashy, self-centered, sex egotists, and didn't have the slightest emotional appeal. Throwing in that Andrew Carter guy was a very bad mistake as he served no purpose in the film and the background on him was non-existent. He was a big jerk to begin with and when he said "I like your ass", he turned out to be just a dirty- minded scumbag who thinks of women as nothing more than something to grab onto and enjoy. At least he got his ass kicked by Nomi. Surprisingly, this movie proved to have some entertainment value, albeit in a different sort of way. Lots of sexy dancing and adult oriented behavior but other than that the movie seemed to drag on for more than its worth. The first time I saw the nudity and sexual scenes, I was like "Yeah, this movie isn't so bad" but then it started to be poured on and on, relentlessly, making it hard to watch. It's hard to appreciate the beauty of seeing some naked body parts on screen when you're almost seeing it the entire time. It should be treated as a reward for watching the film, that is built up to instead of making it look trashy and tasteless. Even for me it got to be kind of sickening to see all of those women walking around naked for a half hour. The plot was just plain stupid. Nomi, a drifter supposedly from New York, comes to Las Vegas wanting to become a dancer and has to climb the ladder and fight the odds to become a top Vegas showgirl. For what? Is she that trashy and desperate for a living that she has to resort to selling her body? And it was played out in even worse fashion. The jokes and humor in this film were crude and just plain unfunny. Who came up with "she looks better than a ten inch dick and you know it"? That ugly hoe popping her boobs out again and again was supposed to be funny? Terrible script and actors/actresses alike who were about as exciting and thoughtful as a glass of water. There were some highlights, if any, in this movie that seemed to hold up what was a essentially a piece of garbage film that I'll never see again. The dancing was sensational, and the Elvis-look- alike guy in the truck was cool...and...well...that's about it. The costume design was downright trashy and it seemed like every flashy dance scene had the women stripping off their clothes and being groped all over. Only a movie to see in your private time. This movie doesn't even deserve an NC-17 rating, if you even call this a "movie". It wouldn't even qualify as a good porn film. It was like a bunch of D-list actors thrown together who don't know where they are going or what to do. They just partied, danced and what not until it was over. There was no chemistry between any of the characters and the progression of getting to know any of them was lackluster. There is so much more wrong with this film but that would probably take a while to write about so I'm just going to say this movie should not be on anyone's wish list. It is the movie that should be banned all across the world (and space if there are civilizations out there). Guard your sons, guard your daughters, this movie is the god of everything terrible and an example of bad-movie making to learn from. A trashy film that even landfills would be scared of. Why it spawned a sequel, I have no clue.

    Showgirls (1995) ** (out of 4) Paul Verhoeven's seriously intended but ultimate disaster about a young woman (Elizabeth Berkley) who arrives in Las Vegas with dreams of becoming a dancer but soon realizes the ugliness behind it. I've never found SHOWGIRLS to be the complete disaster that most people make it out to be. The reason for that is the film is simply way too boring to fit the "so bad it's good" range but at the same time there's no question that this thing contains some of the dumbest stuff you're ever going to see. How on Earth writer Joe Eszterhas ever expecting anyone to take this serious is beyond me because his screenplay has so many problems. For starters, it's basically just a poorly written remake of ALL ABOUT EVE and to make matters worse there's not a single second where you actually feel like you're getting a behind-the-scenes look at Vegas. Another problem is that the main character he wrote is so unlikeable that how are we supposed to care what happens to her? The first sequence with her alone is bad enough but then they follow it up with her going crazy on someone trying to help her. We then see her go off on countless others because she doesn't get what she wants and she just comes across as a psychotic brat and you certainly don't enjoy spending time with her. Then, another problem, is Berkley who just doesn't have the acting talent to pull the role off. I'm not sure a vet could have made this character work but when you still someone like Berkley into it it just becomes all the more bad. Not for a second did you ever feel her in the role and she certainly never brought it to life. Gina Gershon is certainly the best thing in the film but supporting players Kyle MacLachlan, Glenn Plummer and Robert Davi come off good as well. I think SHOWGIRLS would have worked much better had the filmmakers not taken it so serious. They shot for the Moon but came up well short and this here is where the majority of the laughs come from. This isn't one of the worst movies ever made but when 95% of your running time has naked women and it's still not erotic then that there should send a red flag up.

    You know, I'm a film buff and I've seen a lot of movies and I strongly claim that Showgirls is better than %80 of them. First of all it has a straight and fast-narrated story. Believe me, that's where most movies start to lag. The story begins from the very first scene and we learn that a girl in a shortage of money has come to Vegas to find a job as a dancer. This theme has an initial suspense in it which the script never lets it to fall down. Yet some may be bored by the dance scenes but personally I love dance and gaps made by dance sequences in films. From Godard's Band Apart which influenced the dance scene In Pulp Fiction to the Travolta's nice moves in Saturday Night Fever which is also an underrated film. Plus the group dances and choreographies are so fancy and erotic in Showgirls. My favorite one is when two main female characters participate on a stage show and the rivalry between them turns the dance moves into a sort of battle. About the eroticism in the movie, I think this is the aspect which has made everybody to give this title a low rating. But I really don't see Showgirl as a mere erotic picture. It has a story-teller script. The naked scenes are parts of the story. They are a part of the everyday life of characters and the environment surrounding them. Actually here is the point we can speak about the realism in the movie. Showgirls is a realistic movie, it's like a mirror that reflects the true hierarchy and competitions in the night club industry. But the kind of realism is not like Italian or French realism, it's Hollywoodian Realism. It does entertain you while giving you shocking facts about the subject. There are some great movies with similarities to Showgirls. First of all consider "All about Eve", which was made in 1950 about the replacement of generations and rivalry among the Theatre superstars. Some say Showgirls is a remake of All about Eve in a modern entertainment industry like Vegas show business. But personally I don't agree with them, the characteristics of two main female Characters in these movies are different. Another close film to our topic is "Casino" made by M.Scorsese at the same year that Showgirls was produced. Both pictures are made in Las Vegas in splendid and fancy sets and locations, and both have an intensive plot concerned with cruel industries. The irony is that Casino was celebrated by critics and nominated for several awards whereas Showgirls was deemed trash and a worthless sexual fantasy. I think it has the name of Scorsese as the director its reception was different. Although some figures like Tarantino have applauded the movie. "Boogie Nights" by Paul Thomas Anderson is also near to showgirls. It was shot 2 years after Paul Verhoeven's movie and I don't know whether Anderson had seen the other movie or not but if you like Boogie Nights I strongly recommend you to see Showgirls.

    "Who do you have to **** to get off this picture?" --attributed to Bette Davis Who did Elizabeth Berkley have to **** to get starred in "Showgirls"? The movie seems intended as a love letter to her, though I don't recall anyone in the 1990's saying, "Remember Jessie from 'Saved by the Bell'? God, I wish they'd get her into a porno flick so we could see what she's got!" What Berkley's got in "Showgirls" is a more explicit version of her petulance routine from that Saturday morning teen show. Berkley plays Nomi, a girl essentially from nowhere who wants to become a dancer. (And I do mean from nowhere. She has no family whatsoever, and later in the movie, another character has to explain to her what an M.B.A. is.) For no good reason, Nomi decides that becoming a dancer involves hitchhiking to Las Vegas. From that point, the script goes into two major loops. One is that, in one form or another, all the major characters have an obsession with either Nomi's dancing or her breasts. Either Nomi's being told how beautiful her chest is, or she's being told how much raw talent she has as a dancer. I don't know from Las Vegas, but having seen a few dancers and a few breasts in my day, my frank assessment is that Berkley is not outstanding in either department. The other loop is that Nomi is forever either showing off every inch of her lithe body or doing her best to simulate the sex act, only to go running off in anger every time somebody insinuates that she's a hooker. Now, where would anyone get that idea (other than her mentors requesting that she ice up her nipples before every show)? The movie's main, er, thrust is that Nomi works her way up to being a dancer in a show featuring what we're told is Vegas' star attraction, Cristal Connors (Gina Gershon). Eventually, we're told that Cristal has designs on Nomi, mainly so that screenwriter Joe Eszterhas and director Paul Verhoeven (the same enlightened team behind "Basic Instinct") can indulge their lip-smackin' woman-on-woman fantasies. From there, the movie goes into a hyper, NC-17 variation of "All About Eve," or what it would be if Bette Davis and Ann Baxter decided to get it on before they went into career damage control. Despite this movie's seedy reputation, it's not fun enough to be a "good" bad movie. It does have some Ed Wood-like dialogue whoppers -- when Nomi's old boss sees her hit the big time, he blithely comments, "It must be strange not to have someone c*** on you" -- but not enough to sit through this slop. Mostly, the movie makes you wonder how it dragged in actors such as Kyle MacLachlan, "L.A. Law's" Alan Rachins, and most notoriously, Gina Gershon who, with her big breasts and monotone line readings, comes off like Adrienne Barbeau's big sister.

    In a word: eeeeeew. This film will make you ashamed. Or at least it really, really should. One star is given with the word (awful) as an indicator - this film is exactly that - awful. What life itself cannot prepare you for is just how awful this is. Not only does everyone spend more time with their clothes off than on, there is a sadistically nasty streak to the whole thing - including a particularly nasty rape - that sucks all the joy and silliness out of it. I finally got around to watching it having avoided it for the best part of 20 years and now understand why that avoidance was a good thing. It is seriously one of the most utterly appalling films ever made and shows that it is possible to spend millions of dollars on nothing. I will never ever ever watch it again - it's not ironic, or cultic or anything. Just gave this reviewer chills as to how this project ever got greenlighted in the first place. I will not be watching the sequel either. A film only for desperately sad men.

    Sweet little Jesse Spano left the hole-some television series "Shaved By The Bell" in its last season to shave her snatch and dance around nakey for all to see. 22 yo Elizabeth Berkely has no problem waving her 22 yo box around for all of us in this touching story about strippers, cocaine, and a prostitute crackhead trying to turn over a new leaf in Sin City. HBO made an edited version that cuts out much of the story, and even more of her skin, so make sure to get the nasty NC-17 version that is hotter than a Havana Omelette on a dirty blonde's dirty butt-thole. Does the name Penny ring a bell for some reason? This 10 star slit-flick gets my gyno going' each and every time. The flacid jerk-off from "Sex and the City" that Charlotte marries gets a piece of 'ole Jesse, butt we don't mind, she's only about 10,000 times hotter and nastier than that ice-box Charlotte, and she'll kick your ass tunnel at the same time...uh oh, don't wanna give away too much of the goods at once - but that never stopped Elizabeth! Take my advice and come over to the girl-side; yes, yes, let the juice flow through you.

    Good intentions don't always equal good results. Sometimes there's a kink in the machine and you end up with a dud. If one tried to add up the number of films made with good intentions, they'd have a real sore behind. One of the most famous film disasters is this piece by famed director Paul Verhoeven. Intended to be a study of the world of Vegas showgirls, what it really is is a beautiful train wreck. It's like a skin flick with high production values and an A list director and cast. It's a shame the film didn't turn out the way the filmmakers planned, but that doesn't mean it isn't still a great time. Pros: Cast does it's best with the material. Dynamite direction. Concept with potential. Great score. Gorgeous cinematography. Equally stunning sets and costumes. High camp factor. Flows at a good pace. Cons: A lot of awful dialogue. Shallow, clich&eacute; filled script. Final thoughts: Let's not sugarcoat it folks; 'Showgirls' was never going to win any Oscars. With a script this bad, it's a wonder it even made it to the big screen. That aside, it's one of the most enjoyable bad movies of our time. It's pretty to look at and provides a few chuckles. It's also disturbing at times and fortunately those scenes are not played for laughs. Watch it alone or with friends, but do yourself a favor and watch it. My rating: 4/5

    Is the only way I can describe Elizabeth Berkley's so-called acting in this film!. The acting plummets from the moment she pulls out a knife and gives her best angry face in the first two minutes, the acting gets so cheesy it makes Jedward look like a formidable act. I know I seem far too critical but seriously at times the acting gets THAT bad you start feeling awkward, about as awkward when you watch a film with your parents and a nude scene pops up. I just think that the whole film is ruined by Elizabeth's poor acting and cheesy child like mood swings and hissy fits. The dancing looks awful Elizabeth is constantly looking stiff, angry and robotic. If you're looking for a cheap B list movie and a bit of skin then this may be the film for you but be warned the painful part is having to sit through watching it.

    Showgirls might have been a bit better had been the strip-o-gram equivalent of "The Long Good Friday", that is to say a film about someone at the top whose world dramatically falls apart when they thought they'd conquered enough to have it all. As it is, the film is an eerie cocksure mess of a picture; a film embracing the idea of women selling one's body as an appropriate career and a film on the side of women treading the grounds of a Las Vegas stage in order to demean their gender. This is, of course, after providing us with a heartless tract on pro-plastic surgery wherein falsity and such are the answers to life and that you're yet to make it in life should you not be donning the bright, sexy, exotic turf of a Nevada stage. This is one of those awkward projects wherein which the film is rubbish, and we know it's rubbish, but the film in question DOESN'T. The film is about the entry to; the living in, as well as the consequent dominating of, a very specific realm within the American city of Las Vegas perpetrated by a woman named Nomi (Berkley) who's in her twenties. Looking to hitch a ride with just about anyone at the film's outset, the film makes a point to capture just how na&iuml;ve she is at when the guy with whom she journeys swipes her belongings and drives off again. You have to wonder what he thought was in there for him - maybe he thought the case was worth something. Prior to all this, they cruise into town and lay eyes on Vegas for the first time: "There she is (!)" utters the driver, insinuating a general feeling of awe at the lights and at what Vegas conveys. The city is practically glowing, radiating there in the night as this green-horn rumbles on in for the first time looking to make it in the world of dancing and entertainment. The fact Nomi is too trusting of the gentleman, and that she loses at a game of slots in a casino at this very early time in her tenure here, cements her status as being completely out of her depth. Cut to six weeks later, and Nomi is staying with a friend whom she has met in Molly (Ravera). Backstage at a Vegas show, Nomi falls in love with her surroundings; surroundings of which have already fallen in love with that of Cristal Connors (Gershon), the establishment's star showgirl whose changing room is set away from the general chaos of other's and can muster up very little emotion when offered a bouquet of flowers for a latest performance. Such is, one feels, the quantity of past offerings of this ilk born out of this on-going adulation that this reaction is induced. It is here Nomi truly desires to be, it is here Cristal truly desires to stay: there can only be one true showgirl and when they get off on a somewhat negative first foot, battle commences. The film is essentially a string of second unit dance routines wherein very little is on but an awful lot is on show. Ultimately, this does little to raise the film above the level of usual American blockbuster fare - tits and arse are merely standing in for explosions and stunts. There are a number of scenes set at a pole dancing club owned by Al Torres, a slimy character played by Robert Davi  the very place at which Nomi must work if she is to hone her trade and get anywhere near places such as where Connors resides as queen of the stage. It's no secret the film enjoys these scenes, so much so that instead of actually probing as to why it is women might do this sort of work, or desire to be a superstar within these fields in the first place, we are instead invited to watch on; to join the punters and leer. A measure of how all over the place the film truly is lies in one specific sequence, wherein Davi's character briefly re-enters the heroine's life to stop and say hello for a minute. The guy was always a creep, and she was happy to be rid of him; but the romanticised tone as he once again re-enters the frame would suggest he's not all that bad, and that we should ourselves have missed him. I don't think so. Another odd moment arrives during a selection process sequence, when a male individual has for him a row of potential female dancers lined up for them so that he may cast his eye across and deduce whether they're fit for what the job demands  a sort of eerie syncing up with, one assumes, how the likes of Berkley and Gershon landed the roles of Nomi and Connors in the first place. The difference is that within the diegetic world of the film, a creep is at the helm of the project. Whereas one can lay little blame at the door of Paul Verhoven - someone whose female characters in Total Recall and Basic Instinct have been fun; feisty and often sexually charged without requiring the presence of rotten exploitation. The fallacy seems to fall with the fact those films depicted men first and foremost, with the dangerous women in their lives causing a chaos and such at the worst of times. Showgirls is, in a sense, constructed as if a 'men's picture'; a tale of two people vying for supremacy within a domain that pours lavish upon the dominant force and shoves the others to the back. Where Aronofsky's 2011 piece "Black Swan" nailed the case study, Showgirls just ends up being what it is: an overly long chore stuck between being a contemplative mediation and a skin flick, a film which depicts women whilst systematically striking us as not knowing the first thing about them.

    In 1995 'Showgirls' was the most controversial movie to ever come out of Hollywood. It's entire subject value had eyebrows lifting everywhere. The theme itself was a lure to many boys and men to rush to the theatre halls. The MPAA had a difficult time in rating the movie due to it's high sexually graphic nature presentation. I for sure had never seen so many women roam around topless so casually in a movie. No commercial movie to that day had I ever seen nudity depicted in a casual manner. I assume not many directors had the courage to do what Paul Verhoeven had attempted. He surely set a new standard and trend for cinema. But is is unfortunate that this did not become a long term frenzy. Without a doubt he made a daring movie which has gone beyond the realms of conventional cinema. Many would regard it as a true classic. The reason for this being that no other movie has chartered this territory even in the past 15 years. Paul Verhoeven is a competent director. Prior to his career in Hollywood he made movies on the genre of war and erotic natured movies. However I would rate his Hollywood career being his best. His first 2 movies 'Robocop' and 'Total Recall' were sci-fi. After that he made the box office hit 'Basic Instinct'. It's a surprising transition to move from sci-fi to erotic thrillers. But I guess it proves his versatility. 'Showgirls' obviously happened due to the success of 'Basic Instinct'. His collaboration with writer Joe Esterharez returned to the screen in full glare. Joe is a great writer and has always projected the different views of female empowerment in his novels. However the one flaw with 'Showgirls' is the script. Joe's one complaint with the movie was that he felt that sex and nudity camouflaged the small details in his novel. This made the plot appear thin and vague. The audiences admired the movie less for the plot but appreciated Elizabeth Berkeley performance. Mario Kassar is the executive producer this time round and also produced 'Basic Instinct' too. 'Showgirls' does not manage to recreate the magic of 'Basic Instinct'. But both movies are are different and the same team perhaps felt that this would be a profitable venture. The director manages the theme very well. Being a originally a outsider from the industry, he has brought life in to the movie with his creative skills and individual knowledge. The movies central theme is on Las Vegas showgirls. Rather than giving the movie the title 'strippers', 'Showgirls' was more of a respectable title. Vegas is renowned for it's casinos and gambling industry and employs a large number of people. As well as being a tourist attraction, it is also a wealthy state. The movie does not intend on exposing the seedy side but rather concentrates on showing the journey of a woman who is enthusiastic to become a high level showgirl. Many people she encounters throughout the movie are self centred and manipulative, but her character too has many negative qualities. Elizabeth Berkeley gives an honest performance. Her dancing abilities and acting skills are at their highest potential. Her portrayal as a ambitious and ruthless individual is very convincing. However she is not entirely a selfish person. She possesses feelings and demands respect like others too. Her performance is very inspiring and the manner in which she carries herself on screen is very professional. SPOILERS Nomi Malone played by (Elizabeth Berkeley) hitches a ride to Las Vegas. Her intentions are clear from the outset. She aims to become a popular Showgirl. A clothes designer Gina Revere lets her stay with her in her trailer. After enquiring at a few clubs and strip bars, Nomi gets the opportunity to dance at the Cheetah club. Robert Davi is the manager. Without wasting any time she becomes a professional dancer and catches the attention of everybody including Zack (kyle Mullikan) the entertainment manager and Crystal Conner s) Gina Gershon. Later she becomes lucky and gets the opportunity to audition for a showgirl position at the Stardust Hotel. She realises that it is not too easy and to become a high class dancer is very competitive. Her first dance is based on a volcano theme show. She electrifies on stage and becomes the highlight and talk of the town immediately. She becomes the media and people's favourite instantly. After spending a intimate night with Zack, she receives the lead position in a show. This upsets Crystal and she threatens Zack. This creates a conflict between Crystal and Nomi. After the show Nomi pushes Crystal down a flight of steps. This secures her position in the long term and leads to better things. However her friend Gina has a horrid encounter with her idolised singer, which makes Nomi think twice about her career and what consequences may occur if associating with the wrong people. END OF SPOILER This is Paul Verhoeven's less intellectual movies, as the content level is low in contrast to his previous movies. He gives an alternate view of his understanding of the entertainment business in Las Vegas. Under the glossy interiors lies a world that is full of people that are self centred, selfish and corrupt. It is awkward that Nomi feels strange when others behave towards her in the same manner. I could not understand why Esteharez shows Nomi's struggle as being too simple. She had to too easy for her. But I was convinced with her Short term struggles and I'm sure that many women may be able to relate to her character. The movie progresses at a moderate rate but the second hour is more productive as Nomi's character develops in to a complex phase. There are many dance sequences in the movie. They are pictured on a extravagant level.

    A momentous task in my life is done - I have watched Showgirls- and I have to say it was better than I expected but still not worthy of more than 3 stars. Let's start off with the lead actress (Elizabeth Berkly). She is the worst I have seen. She had one facial expression, sucked at trying to be serious, and couldn't dance her way out of hell(lots of huffing and puffing). I didn't even think she was that good looking, she has a horse- face. She had no grace at all and looked ridiculous in her role. The lead character, Nomi , said she wasn't a whore but oh she really played the whore/slut card pretty darn well throughout the whole movie. Every single character seemed to blend together and was lifeless. Really, there were no stand-out characters, they all were one-dimensional and had less expression than a plastic Barbie doll. There was nothing genuine about anyone, they were just trashy, self-centered, sex egotists, and didn't have the slightest emotional appeal. Throwing in that Andrew Carter guy was a very bad mistake as he served no purpose in the film and the background on him was non-existent. He was a big jerk to begin with and when he said "I like your ass", he turned out to be just a dirty- minded scumbag who thinks of women as nothing more than something to grab onto and enjoy. At least he got his ass kicked by Nomi. Surprisingly, this movie proved to have some entertainment value, albeit in a different sort of way. Lots of sexy dancing and adult oriented behavior but other than that the movie seemed to drag on for more than its worth. The first time I saw the nudity and sexual scenes, I was like "Yeah, this movie isn't so bad" but then it started to be poured on and on, relentlessly, making it hard to watch. It's hard to appreciate the beauty of seeing some naked body parts on screen when you're almost seeing it the entire time. It should be treated as a reward for watching the film, that is built up to instead of making it look trashy and tasteless. Even for me it got to be kind of sickening to see all of those women walking around naked for a half hour. The plot was just plain stupid. Nomi, a drifter supposedly from New York, comes to Las Vegas wanting to become a dancer and has to climb the ladder and fight the odds to become a top Vegas showgirl. For what? Is she that trashy and desperate for a living that she has to resort to selling her body? And it was played out in even worse fashion. The jokes and humor in this film were crude and just plain unfunny. Who came up with "she looks better than a ten inch dick and you know it"? That ugly hoe popping her boobs out again and again was supposed to be funny? Terrible script and actors/actresses alike who were about as exciting and thoughtful as a glass of water. There were some highlights, if any, in this movie that seemed to hold up what was a essentially a piece of garbage film that I'll never see again. The dancing was sensational, and the Elvis-look- alike guy in the truck was cool...and...well...that's about it. The costume design was downright trashy and it seemed like every flashy dance scene had the women stripping off their clothes and being groped all over. Only a movie to see in your private time. This movie doesn't even deserve an NC-17 rating, if you even call this a "movie". It wouldn't even qualify as a good porn film. It was like a bunch of D-list actors thrown together who don't know where they are going or what to do. They just partied, danced and what not until it was over. There was no chemistry between any of the characters and the progression of getting to know any of them was lackluster. There is so much more wrong with this film but that would probably take a while to write about so I'm just going to say this movie should not be on anyone's wish list. It is the movie that should be banned all across the world (and space if there are civilizations out there). Guard your sons, guard your daughters, this movie is the god of everything terrible and an example of bad-movie making to learn from. A trashy film that even landfills would be scared of. Why it spawned a sequel, I have no clue.

    Showgirls (1995) ** (out of 4) Paul Verhoeven's seriously intended but ultimate disaster about a young woman (Elizabeth Berkley) who arrives in Las Vegas with dreams of becoming a dancer but soon realizes the ugliness behind it. I've never found SHOWGIRLS to be the complete disaster that most people make it out to be. The reason for that is the film is simply way too boring to fit the "so bad it's good" range but at the same time there's no question that this thing contains some of the dumbest stuff you're ever going to see. How on Earth writer Joe Eszterhas ever expecting anyone to take this serious is beyond me because his screenplay has so many problems. For starters, it's basically just a poorly written remake of ALL ABOUT EVE and to make matters worse there's not a single second where you actually feel like you're getting a behind-the-scenes look at Vegas. Another problem is that the main character he wrote is so unlikeable that how are we supposed to care what happens to her? The first sequence with her alone is bad enough but then they follow it up with her going crazy on someone trying to help her. We then see her go off on countless others because she doesn't get what she wants and she just comes across as a psychotic brat and you certainly don't enjoy spending time with her. Then, another problem, is Berkley who just doesn't have the acting talent to pull the role off. I'm not sure a vet could have made this character work but when you still someone like Berkley into it it just becomes all the more bad. Not for a second did you ever feel her in the role and she certainly never brought it to life. Gina Gershon is certainly the best thing in the film but supporting players Kyle MacLachlan, Glenn Plummer and Robert Davi come off good as well. I think SHOWGIRLS would have worked much better had the filmmakers not taken it so serious. They shot for the Moon but came up well short and this here is where the majority of the laughs come from. This isn't one of the worst movies ever made but when 95% of your running time has naked women and it's still not erotic then that there should send a red flag up.

    You know, I'm a film buff and I've seen a lot of movies and I strongly claim that Showgirls is better than %80 of them. First of all it has a straight and fast-narrated story. Believe me, that's where most movies start to lag. The story begins from the very first scene and we learn that a girl in a shortage of money has come to Vegas to find a job as a dancer. This theme has an initial suspense in it which the script never lets it to fall down. Yet some may be bored by the dance scenes but personally I love dance and gaps made by dance sequences in films. From Godard's Band Apart which influenced the dance scene In Pulp Fiction to the Travolta's nice moves in Saturday Night Fever which is also an underrated film. Plus the group dances and choreographies are so fancy and erotic in Showgirls. My favorite one is when two main female characters participate on a stage show and the rivalry between them turns the dance moves into a sort of battle. About the eroticism in the movie, I think this is the aspect which has made everybody to give this title a low rating. But I really don't see Showgirl as a mere erotic picture. It has a story-teller script. The naked scenes are parts of the story. They are a part of the everyday life of characters and the environment surrounding them. Actually here is the point we can speak about the realism in the movie. Showgirls is a realistic movie, it's like a mirror that reflects the true hierarchy and competitions in the night club industry. But the kind of realism is not like Italian or French realism, it's Hollywoodian Realism. It does entertain you while giving you shocking facts about the subject. There are some great movies with similarities to Showgirls. First of all consider "All about Eve", which was made in 1950 about the replacement of generations and rivalry among the Theatre superstars. Some say Showgirls is a remake of All about Eve in a modern entertainment industry like Vegas show business. But personally I don't agree with them, the characteristics of two main female Characters in these movies are different. Another close film to our topic is "Casino" made by M.Scorsese at the same year that Showgirls was produced. Both pictures are made in Las Vegas in splendid and fancy sets and locations, and both have an intensive plot concerned with cruel industries. The irony is that Casino was celebrated by critics and nominated for several awards whereas Showgirls was deemed trash and a worthless sexual fantasy. I think it has the name of Scorsese as the director its reception was different. Although some figures like Tarantino have applauded the movie. "Boogie Nights" by Paul Thomas Anderson is also near to showgirls. It was shot 2 years after Paul Verhoeven's movie and I don't know whether Anderson had seen the other movie or not but if you like Boogie Nights I strongly recommend you to see Showgirls.

    "Who do you have to **** to get off this picture?" --attributed to Bette Davis Who did Elizabeth Berkley have to **** to get starred in "Showgirls"? The movie seems intended as a love letter to her, though I don't recall anyone in the 1990's saying, "Remember Jessie from 'Saved by the Bell'? God, I wish they'd get her into a porno flick so we could see what she's got!" What Berkley's got in "Showgirls" is a more explicit version of her petulance routine from that Saturday morning teen show. Berkley plays Nomi, a girl essentially from nowhere who wants to become a dancer. (And I do mean from nowhere. She has no family whatsoever, and later in the movie, another character has to explain to her what an M.B.A. is.) For no good reason, Nomi decides that becoming a dancer involves hitchhiking to Las Vegas. From that point, the script goes into two major loops. One is that, in one form or another, all the major characters have an obsession with either Nomi's dancing or her breasts. Either Nomi's being told how beautiful her chest is, or she's being told how much raw talent she has as a dancer. I don't know from Las Vegas, but having seen a few dancers and a few breasts in my day, my frank assessment is that Berkley is not outstanding in either department. The other loop is that Nomi is forever either showing off every inch of her lithe body or doing her best to simulate the sex act, only to go running off in anger every time somebody insinuates that she's a hooker. Now, where would anyone get that idea (other than her mentors requesting that she ice up her nipples before every show)? The movie's main, er, thrust is that Nomi works her way up to being a dancer in a show featuring what we're told is Vegas' star attraction, Cristal Connors (Gina Gershon). Eventually, we're told that Cristal has designs on Nomi, mainly so that screenwriter Joe Eszterhas and director Paul Verhoeven (the same enlightened team behind "Basic Instinct") can indulge their lip-smackin' woman-on-woman fantasies. From there, the movie goes into a hyper, NC-17 variation of "All About Eve," or what it would be if Bette Davis and Ann Baxter decided to get it on before they went into career damage control. Despite this movie's seedy reputation, it's not fun enough to be a "good" bad movie. It does have some Ed Wood-like dialogue whoppers -- when Nomi's old boss sees her hit the big time, he blithely comments, "It must be strange not to have someone c*** on you" -- but not enough to sit through this slop. Mostly, the movie makes you wonder how it dragged in actors such as Kyle MacLachlan, "L.A. Law's" Alan Rachins, and most notoriously, Gina Gershon who, with her big breasts and monotone line readings, comes off like Adrienne Barbeau's big sister.

    In a word: eeeeeew. This film will make you ashamed. Or at least it really, really should. One star is given with the word (awful) as an indicator - this film is exactly that - awful. What life itself cannot prepare you for is just how awful this is. Not only does everyone spend more time with their clothes off than on, there is a sadistically nasty streak to the whole thing - including a particularly nasty rape - that sucks all the joy and silliness out of it. I finally got around to watching it having avoided it for the best part of 20 years and now understand why that avoidance was a good thing. It is seriously one of the most utterly appalling films ever made and shows that it is possible to spend millions of dollars on nothing. I will never ever ever watch it again - it's not ironic, or cultic or anything. Just gave this reviewer chills as to how this project ever got greenlighted in the first place. I will not be watching the sequel either. A film only for desperately sad men.

    Sweet little Jesse Spano left the hole-some television series "Shaved By The Bell" in its last season to shave her snatch and dance around nakey for all to see. 22 yo Elizabeth Berkely has no problem waving her 22 yo box around for all of us in this touching story about strippers, cocaine, and a prostitute crackhead trying to turn over a new leaf in Sin City. HBO made an edited version that cuts out much of the story, and even more of her skin, so make sure to get the nasty NC-17 version that is hotter than a Havana Omelette on a dirty blonde's dirty butt-thole. Does the name Penny ring a bell for some reason? This 10 star slit-flick gets my gyno going' each and every time. The flacid jerk-off from "Sex and the City" that Charlotte marries gets a piece of 'ole Jesse, butt we don't mind, she's only about 10,000 times hotter and nastier than that ice-box Charlotte, and she'll kick your ass tunnel at the same time...uh oh, don't wanna give away too much of the goods at once - but that never stopped Elizabeth! Take my advice and come over to the girl-side; yes, yes, let the juice flow through you.

    Good intentions don't always equal good results. Sometimes there's a kink in the machine and you end up with a dud. If one tried to add up the number of films made with good intentions, they'd have a real sore behind. One of the most famous film disasters is this piece by famed director Paul Verhoeven. Intended to be a study of the world of Vegas showgirls, what it really is is a beautiful train wreck. It's like a skin flick with high production values and an A list director and cast. It's a shame the film didn't turn out the way the filmmakers planned, but that doesn't mean it isn't still a great time. Pros: Cast does it's best with the material. Dynamite direction. Concept with potential. Great score. Gorgeous cinematography. Equally stunning sets and costumes. High camp factor. Flows at a good pace. Cons: A lot of awful dialogue. Shallow, clich&eacute; filled script. Final thoughts: Let's not sugarcoat it folks; 'Showgirls' was never going to win any Oscars. With a script this bad, it's a wonder it even made it to the big screen. That aside, it's one of the most enjoyable bad movies of our time. It's pretty to look at and provides a few chuckles. It's also disturbing at times and fortunately those scenes are not played for laughs. Watch it alone or with friends, but do yourself a favor and watch it. My rating: 4/5

    Is the only way I can describe Elizabeth Berkley's so-called acting in this film!. The acting plummets from the moment she pulls out a knife and gives her best angry face in the first two minutes, the acting gets so cheesy it makes Jedward look like a formidable act. I know I seem far too critical but seriously at times the acting gets THAT bad you start feeling awkward, about as awkward when you watch a film with your parents and a nude scene pops up. I just think that the whole film is ruined by Elizabeth's poor acting and cheesy child like mood swings and hissy fits. The dancing looks awful Elizabeth is constantly looking stiff, angry and robotic. If you're looking for a cheap B list movie and a bit of skin then this may be the film for you but be warned the painful part is having to sit through watching it.

    Showgirls might have been a bit better had been the strip-o-gram equivalent of "The Long Good Friday", that is to say a film about someone at the top whose world dramatically falls apart when they thought they'd conquered enough to have it all. As it is, the film is an eerie cocksure mess of a picture; a film embracing the idea of women selling one's body as an appropriate career and a film on the side of women treading the grounds of a Las Vegas stage in order to demean their gender. This is, of course, after providing us with a heartless tract on pro-plastic surgery wherein falsity and such are the answers to life and that you're yet to make it in life should you not be donning the bright, sexy, exotic turf of a Nevada stage. This is one of those awkward projects wherein which the film is rubbish, and we know it's rubbish, but the film in question DOESN'T. The film is about the entry to; the living in, as well as the consequent dominating of, a very specific realm within the American city of Las Vegas perpetrated by a woman named Nomi (Berkley) who's in her twenties. Looking to hitch a ride with just about anyone at the film's outset, the film makes a point to capture just how na&iuml;ve she is at when the guy with whom she journeys swipes her belongings and drives off again. You have to wonder what he thought was in there for him - maybe he thought the case was worth something. Prior to all this, they cruise into town and lay eyes on Vegas for the first time: "There she is (!)" utters the driver, insinuating a general feeling of awe at the lights and at what Vegas conveys. The city is practically glowing, radiating there in the night as this green-horn rumbles on in for the first time looking to make it in the world of dancing and entertainment. The fact Nomi is too trusting of the gentleman, and that she loses at a game of slots in a casino at this very early time in her tenure here, cements her status as being completely out of her depth. Cut to six weeks later, and Nomi is staying with a friend whom she has met in Molly (Ravera). Backstage at a Vegas show, Nomi falls in love with her surroundings; surroundings of which have already fallen in love with that of Cristal Connors (Gershon), the establishment's star showgirl whose changing room is set away from the general chaos of other's and can muster up very little emotion when offered a bouquet of flowers for a latest performance. Such is, one feels, the quantity of past offerings of this ilk born out of this on-going adulation that this reaction is induced. It is here Nomi truly desires to be, it is here Cristal truly desires to stay: there can only be one true showgirl and when they get off on a somewhat negative first foot, battle commences. The film is essentially a string of second unit dance routines wherein very little is on but an awful lot is on show. Ultimately, this does little to raise the film above the level of usual American blockbuster fare - tits and arse are merely standing in for explosions and stunts. There are a number of scenes set at a pole dancing club owned by Al Torres, a slimy character played by Robert Davi  the very place at which Nomi must work if she is to hone her trade and get anywhere near places such as where Connors resides as queen of the stage. It's no secret the film enjoys these scenes, so much so that instead of actually probing as to why it is women might do this sort of work, or desire to be a superstar within these fields in the first place, we are instead invited to watch on; to join the punters and leer. A measure of how all over the place the film truly is lies in one specific sequence, wherein Davi's character briefly re-enters the heroine's life to stop and say hello for a minute. The guy was always a creep, and she was happy to be rid of him; but the romanticised tone as he once again re-enters the frame would suggest he's not all that bad, and that we should ourselves have missed him. I don't think so. Another odd moment arrives during a selection process sequence, when a male individual has for him a row of potential female dancers lined up for them so that he may cast his eye across and deduce whether they're fit for what the job demands  a sort of eerie syncing up with, one assumes, how the likes of Berkley and Gershon landed the roles of Nomi and Connors in the first place. The difference is that within the diegetic world of the film, a creep is at the helm of the project. Whereas one can lay little blame at the door of Paul Verhoven - someone whose female characters in Total Recall and Basic Instinct have been fun; feisty and often sexually charged without requiring the presence of rotten exploitation. The fallacy seems to fall with the fact those films depicted men first and foremost, with the dangerous women in their lives causing a chaos and such at the worst of times. Showgirls is, in a sense, constructed as if a 'men's picture'; a tale of two people vying for supremacy within a domain that pours lavish upon the dominant force and shoves the others to the back. Where Aronofsky's 2011 piece "Black Swan" nailed the case study, Showgirls just ends up being what it is: an overly long chore stuck between being a contemplative mediation and a skin flick, a film which depicts women whilst systematically striking us as not knowing the first thing about them.

    In 1995 'Showgirls' was the most controversial movie to ever come out of Hollywood. It's entire subject value had eyebrows lifting everywhere. The theme itself was a lure to many boys and men to rush to the theatre halls. The MPAA had a difficult time in rating the movie due to it's high sexually graphic nature presentation. I for sure had never seen so many women roam around topless so casually in a movie. No commercial movie to that day had I ever seen nudity depicted in a casual manner. I assume not many directors had the courage to do what Paul Verhoeven had attempted. He surely set a new standard and trend for cinema. But is is unfortunate that this did not become a long term frenzy. Without a doubt he made a daring movie which has gone beyond the realms of conventional cinema. Many would regard it as a true classic. The reason for this being that no other movie has chartered this territory even in the past 15 years. Paul Verhoeven is a competent director. Prior to his career in Hollywood he made movies on the genre of war and erotic natured movies. However I would rate his Hollywood career being his best. His first 2 movies 'Robocop' and 'Total Recall' were sci-fi. After that he made the box office hit 'Basic Instinct'. It's a surprising transition to move from sci-fi to erotic thrillers. But I guess it proves his versatility. 'Showgirls' obviously happened due to the success of 'Basic Instinct'. His collaboration with writer Joe Esterharez returned to the screen in full glare. Joe is a great writer and has always projected the different views of female empowerment in his novels. However the one flaw with 'Showgirls' is the script. Joe's one complaint with the movie was that he felt that sex and nudity camouflaged the small details in his novel. This made the plot appear thin and vague. The audiences admired the movie less for the plot but appreciated Elizabeth Berkeley performance. Mario Kassar is the executive producer this time round and also produced 'Basic Instinct' too. 'Showgirls' does not manage to recreate the magic of 'Basic Instinct'. But both movies are are different and the same team perhaps felt that this would be a profitable venture. The director manages the theme very well. Being a originally a outsider from the industry, he has brought life in to the movie with his creative skills and individual knowledge. The movies central theme is on Las Vegas showgirls. Rather than giving the movie the title 'strippers', 'Showgirls' was more of a respectable title. Vegas is renowned for it's casinos and gambling industry and employs a large number of people. As well as being a tourist attraction, it is also a wealthy state. The movie does not intend on exposing the seedy side but rather concentrates on showing the journey of a woman who is enthusiastic to become a high level showgirl. Many people she encounters throughout the movie are self centred and manipulative, but her character too has many negative qualities. Elizabeth Berkeley gives an honest performance. Her dancing abilities and acting skills are at their highest potential. Her portrayal as a ambitious and ruthless individual is very convincing. However she is not entirely a selfish person. She possesses feelings and demands respect like others too. Her performance is very inspiring and the manner in which she carries herself on screen is very professional. SPOILERS Nomi Malone played by (Elizabeth Berkeley) hitches a ride to Las Vegas. Her intentions are clear from the outset. She aims to become a popular Showgirl. A clothes designer Gina Revere lets her stay with her in her trailer. After enquiring at a few clubs and strip bars, Nomi gets the opportunity to dance at the Cheetah club. Robert Davi is the manager. Without wasting any time she becomes a professional dancer and catches the attention of everybody including Zack (kyle Mullikan) the entertainment manager and Crystal Conner s) Gina Gershon. Later she becomes lucky and gets the opportunity to audition for a showgirl position at the Stardust Hotel. She realises that it is not too easy and to become a high class dancer is very competitive. Her first dance is based on a volcano theme show. She electrifies on stage and becomes the highlight and talk of the town immediately. She becomes the media and people's favourite instantly. After spending a intimate night with Zack, she receives the lead position in a show. This upsets Crystal and she threatens Zack. This creates a conflict between Crystal and Nomi. After the show Nomi pushes Crystal down a flight of steps. This secures her position in the long term and leads to better things. However her friend Gina has a horrid encounter with her idolised singer, which makes Nomi think twice about her career and what consequences may occur if associating with the wrong people. END OF SPOILER This is Paul Verhoeven's less intellectual movies, as the content level is low in contrast to his previous movies. He gives an alternate view of his understanding of the entertainment business in Las Vegas. Under the glossy interiors lies a world that is full of people that are self centred, selfish and corrupt. It is awkward that Nomi feels strange when others behave towards her in the same manner. I could not understand why Esteharez shows Nomi's struggle as being too simple. She had to too easy for her. But I was convinced with her Short term struggles and I'm sure that many women may be able to relate to her character. The movie progresses at a moderate rate but the second hour is more productive as Nomi's character develops in to a complex phase. There are many dance sequences in the movie. They are pictured on a extravagant level.

    A momentous task in my life is done - I have watched Showgirls- and I have to say it was better than I expected but still not worthy of more than 3 stars. Let's start off with the lead actress (Elizabeth Berkly). She is the worst I have seen. She had one facial expression, sucked at trying to be serious, and couldn't dance her way out of hell(lots of huffing and puffing). I didn't even think she was that good looking, she has a horse- face. She had no grace at all and looked ridiculous in her role. The lead character, Nomi , said she wasn't a whore but oh she really played the whore/slut card pretty darn well throughout the whole movie. Every single character seemed to blend together and was lifeless. Really, there were no stand-out characters, they all were one-dimensional and had less expression than a plastic Barbie doll. There was nothing genuine about anyone, they were just trashy, self-centered, sex egotists, and didn't have the slightest emotional appeal. Throwing in that Andrew Carter guy was a very bad mistake as he served no purpose in the film and the background on him was non-existent. He was a big jerk to begin with and when he said "I like your ass", he turned out to be just a dirty- minded scumbag who thinks of women as nothing more than something to grab onto and enjoy. At least he got his ass kicked by Nomi. Surprisingly, this movie proved to have some entertainment value, albeit in a different sort of way. Lots of sexy dancing and adult oriented behavior but other than that the movie seemed to drag on for more than its worth. The first time I saw the nudity and sexual scenes, I was like "Yeah, this movie isn't so bad" but then it started to be poured on and on, relentlessly, making it hard to watch. It's hard to appreciate the beauty of seeing some naked body parts on screen when you're almost seeing it the entire time. It should be treated as a reward for watching the film, that is built up to instead of making it look trashy and tasteless. Even for me it got to be kind of sickening to see all of those women walking around naked for a half hour. The plot was just plain stupid. Nomi, a drifter supposedly from New York, comes to Las Vegas wanting to become a dancer and has to climb the ladder and fight the odds to become a top Vegas showgirl. For what? Is she that trashy and desperate for a living that she has to resort to selling her body? And it was played out in even worse fashion. The jokes and humor in this film were crude and just plain unfunny. Who came up with "she looks better than a ten inch dick and you know it"? That ugly hoe popping her boobs out again and again was supposed to be funny? Terrible script and actors/actresses alike who were about as exciting and thoughtful as a glass of water. There were some highlights, if any, in this movie that seemed to hold up what was a essentially a piece of garbage film that I'll never see again. The dancing was sensational, and the Elvis-look- alike guy in the truck was cool...and...well...that's about it. The costume design was downright trashy and it seemed like every flashy dance scene had the women stripping off their clothes and being groped all over. Only a movie to see in your private time. This movie doesn't even deserve an NC-17 rating, if you even call this a "movie". It wouldn't even qualify as a good porn film. It was like a bunch of D-list actors thrown together who don't know where they are going or what to do. They just partied, danced and what not until it was over. There was no chemistry between any of the characters and the progression of getting to know any of them was lackluster. There is so much more wrong with this film but that would probably take a while to write about so I'm just going to say this movie should not be on anyone's wish list. It is the movie that should be banned all across the world (and space if there are civilizations out there). Guard your sons, guard your daughters, this movie is the god of everything terrible and an example of bad-movie making to learn from. A trashy film that even landfills would be scared of. Why it spawned a sequel, I have no clue.

    Showgirls (1995) ** (out of 4) Paul Verhoeven's seriously intended but ultimate disaster about a young woman (Elizabeth Berkley) who arrives in Las Vegas with dreams of becoming a dancer but soon realizes the ugliness behind it. I've never found SHOWGIRLS to be the complete disaster that most people make it out to be. The reason for that is the film is simply way too boring to fit the "so bad it's good" range but at the same time there's no question that this thing contains some of the dumbest stuff you're ever going to see. How on Earth writer Joe Eszterhas ever expecting anyone to take this serious is beyond me because his screenplay has so many problems. For starters, it's basically just a poorly written remake of ALL ABOUT EVE and to make matters worse there's not a single second where you actually feel like you're getting a behind-the-scenes look at Vegas. Another problem is that the main character he wrote is so unlikeable that how are we supposed to care what happens to her? The first sequence with her alone is bad enough but then they follow it up with her going crazy on someone trying to help her. We then see her go off on countless others because she doesn't get what she wants and she just comes across as a psychotic brat and you certainly don't enjoy spending time with her. Then, another problem, is Berkley who just doesn't have the acting talent to pull the role off. I'm not sure a vet could have made this character work but when you still someone like Berkley into it it just becomes all the more bad. Not for a second did you ever feel her in the role and she certainly never brought it to life. Gina Gershon is certainly the best thing in the film but supporting players Kyle MacLachlan, Glenn Plummer and Robert Davi come off good as well. I think SHOWGIRLS would have worked much better had the filmmakers not taken it so serious. They shot for the Moon but came up well short and this here is where the majority of the laughs come from. This isn't one of the worst movies ever made but when 95% of your running time has naked women and it's still not erotic then that there should send a red flag up.

    You know, I'm a film buff and I've seen a lot of movies and I strongly claim that Showgirls is better than %80 of them. First of all it has a straight and fast-narrated story. Believe me, that's where most movies start to lag. The story begins from the very first scene and we learn that a girl in a shortage of money has come to Vegas to find a job as a dancer. This theme has an initial suspense in it which the script never lets it to fall down. Yet some may be bored by the dance scenes but personally I love dance and gaps made by dance sequences in films. From Godard's Band Apart which influenced the dance scene In Pulp Fiction to the Travolta's nice moves in Saturday Night Fever which is also an underrated film. Plus the group dances and choreographies are so fancy and erotic in Showgirls. My favorite one is when two main female characters participate on a stage show and the rivalry between them turns the dance moves into a sort of battle. About the eroticism in the movie, I think this is the aspect which has made everybody to give this title a low rating. But I really don't see Showgirl as a mere erotic picture. It has a story-teller script. The naked scenes are parts of the story. They are a part of the everyday life of characters and the environment surrounding them. Actually here is the point we can speak about the realism in the movie. Showgirls is a realistic movie, it's like a mirror that reflects the true hierarchy and competitions in the night club industry. But the kind of realism is not like Italian or French realism, it's Hollywoodian Realism. It does entertain you while giving you shocking facts about the subject. There are some great movies with similarities to Showgirls. First of all consider "All about Eve", which was made in 1950 about the replacement of generations and rivalry among the Theatre superstars. Some say Showgirls is a remake of All about Eve in a modern entertainment industry like Vegas show business. But personally I don't agree with them, the characteristics of two main female Characters in these movies are different. Another close film to our topic is "Casino" made by M.Scorsese at the same year that Showgirls was produced. Both pictures are made in Las Vegas in splendid and fancy sets and locations, and both have an intensive plot concerned with cruel industries. The irony is that Casino was celebrated by critics and nominated for several awards whereas Showgirls was deemed trash and a worthless sexual fantasy. I think it has the name of Scorsese as the director its reception was different. Although some figures like Tarantino have applauded the movie. "Boogie Nights" by Paul Thomas Anderson is also near to showgirls. It was shot 2 years after Paul Verhoeven's movie and I don't know whether Anderson had seen the other movie or not but if you like Boogie Nights I strongly recommend you to see Showgirls.

    "Who do you have to **** to get off this picture?" --attributed to Bette Davis Who did Elizabeth Berkley have to **** to get starred in "Showgirls"? The movie seems intended as a love letter to her, though I don't recall anyone in the 1990's saying, "Remember Jessie from 'Saved by the Bell'? God, I wish they'd get her into a porno flick so we could see what she's got!" What Berkley's got in "Showgirls" is a more explicit version of her petulance routine from that Saturday morning teen show. Berkley plays Nomi, a girl essentially from nowhere who wants to become a dancer. (And I do mean from nowhere. She has no family whatsoever, and later in the movie, another character has to explain to her what an M.B.A. is.) For no good reason, Nomi decides that becoming a dancer involves hitchhiking to Las Vegas. From that point, the script goes into two major loops. One is that, in one form or another, all the major characters have an obsession with either Nomi's dancing or her breasts. Either Nomi's being told how beautiful her chest is, or she's being told how much raw talent she has as a dancer. I don't know from Las Vegas, but having seen a few dancers and a few breasts in my day, my frank assessment is that Berkley is not outstanding in either department. The other loop is that Nomi is forever either showing off every inch of her lithe body or doing her best to simulate the sex act, only to go running off in anger every time somebody insinuates that she's a hooker. Now, where would anyone get that idea (other than her mentors requesting that she ice up her nipples before every show)? The movie's main, er, thrust is that Nomi works her way up to being a dancer in a show featuring what we're told is Vegas' star attraction, Cristal Connors (Gina Gershon). Eventually, we're told that Cristal has designs on Nomi, mainly so that screenwriter Joe Eszterhas and director Paul Verhoeven (the same enlightened team behind "Basic Instinct") can indulge their lip-smackin' woman-on-woman fantasies. From there, the movie goes into a hyper, NC-17 variation of "All About Eve," or what it would be if Bette Davis and Ann Baxter decided to get it on before they went into career damage control. Despite this movie's seedy reputation, it's not fun enough to be a "good" bad movie. It does have some Ed Wood-like dialogue whoppers -- when Nomi's old boss sees her hit the big time, he blithely comments, "It must be strange not to have someone c*** on you" -- but not enough to sit through this slop. Mostly, the movie makes you wonder how it dragged in actors such as Kyle MacLachlan, "L.A. Law's" Alan Rachins, and most notoriously, Gina Gershon who, with her big breasts and monotone line readings, comes off like Adrienne Barbeau's big sister.

    In a word: eeeeeew. This film will make you ashamed. Or at least it really, really should. One star is given with the word (awful) as an indicator - this film is exactly that - awful. What life itself cannot prepare you for is just how awful this is. Not only does everyone spend more time with their clothes off than on, there is a sadistically nasty streak to the whole thing - including a particularly nasty rape - that sucks all the joy and silliness out of it. I finally got around to watching it having avoided it for the best part of 20 years and now understand why that avoidance was a good thing. It is seriously one of the most utterly appalling films ever made and shows that it is possible to spend millions of dollars on nothing. I will never ever ever watch it again - it's not ironic, or cultic or anything. Just gave this reviewer chills as to how this project ever got greenlighted in the first place. I will not be watching the sequel either. A film only for desperately sad men.

    Sweet little Jesse Spano left the hole-some television series "Shaved By The Bell" in its last season to shave her snatch and dance around nakey for all to see. 22 yo Elizabeth Berkely has no problem waving her 22 yo box around for all of us in this touching story about strippers, cocaine, and a prostitute crackhead trying to turn over a new leaf in Sin City. HBO made an edited version that cuts out much of the story, and even more of her skin, so make sure to get the nasty NC-17 version that is hotter than a Havana Omelette on a dirty blonde's dirty butt-thole. Does the name Penny ring a bell for some reason? This 10 star slit-flick gets my gyno going' each and every time. The flacid jerk-off from "Sex and the City" that Charlotte marries gets a piece of 'ole Jesse, butt we don't mind, she's only about 10,000 times hotter and nastier than that ice-box Charlotte, and she'll kick your ass tunnel at the same time...uh oh, don't wanna give away too much of the goods at once - but that never stopped Elizabeth! Take my advice and come over to the girl-side; yes, yes, let the juice flow through you.

    Good intentions don't always equal good results. Sometimes there's a kink in the machine and you end up with a dud. If one tried to add up the number of films made with good intentions, they'd have a real sore behind. One of the most famous film disasters is this piece by famed director Paul Verhoeven. Intended to be a study of the world of Vegas showgirls, what it really is is a beautiful train wreck. It's like a skin flick with high production values and an A list director and cast. It's a shame the film didn't turn out the way the filmmakers planned, but that doesn't mean it isn't still a great time. Pros: Cast does it's best with the material. Dynamite direction. Concept with potential. Great score. Gorgeous cinematography. Equally stunning sets and costumes. High camp factor. Flows at a good pace. Cons: A lot of awful dialogue. Shallow, clich&eacute; filled script. Final thoughts: Let's not sugarcoat it folks; 'Showgirls' was never going to win any Oscars. With a script this bad, it's a wonder it even made it to the big screen. That aside, it's one of the most enjoyable bad movies of our time. It's pretty to look at and provides a few chuckles. It's also disturbing at times and fortunately those scenes are not played for laughs. Watch it alone or with friends, but do yourself a favor and watch it. My rating: 4/5

    Is the only way I can describe Elizabeth Berkley's so-called acting in this film!. The acting plummets from the moment she pulls out a knife and gives her best angry face in the first two minutes, the acting gets so cheesy it makes Jedward look like a formidable act. I know I seem far too critical but seriously at times the acting gets THAT bad you start feeling awkward, about as awkward when you watch a film with your parents and a nude scene pops up. I just think that the whole film is ruined by Elizabeth's poor acting and cheesy child like mood swings and hissy fits. The dancing looks awful Elizabeth is constantly looking stiff, angry and robotic. If you're looking for a cheap B list movie and a bit of skin then this may be the film for you but be warned the painful part is having to sit through watching it.

    Showgirls might have been a bit better had been the strip-o-gram equivalent of "The Long Good Friday", that is to say a film about someone at the top whose world dramatically falls apart when they thought they'd conquered enough to have it all. As it is, the film is an eerie cocksure mess of a picture; a film embracing the idea of women selling one's body as an appropriate career and a film on the side of women treading the grounds of a Las Vegas stage in order to demean their gender. This is, of course, after providing us with a heartless tract on pro-plastic surgery wherein falsity and such are the answers to life and that you're yet to make it in life should you not be donning the bright, sexy, exotic turf of a Nevada stage. This is one of those awkward projects wherein which the film is rubbish, and we know it's rubbish, but the film in question DOESN'T. The film is about the entry to; the living in, as well as the consequent dominating of, a very specific realm within the American city of Las Vegas perpetrated by a woman named Nomi (Berkley) who's in her twenties. Looking to hitch a ride with just about anyone at the film's outset, the film makes a point to capture just how na&iuml;ve she is at when the guy with whom she journeys swipes her belongings and drives off again. You have to wonder what he thought was in there for him - maybe he thought the case was worth something. Prior to all this, they cruise into town and lay eyes on Vegas for the first time: "There she is (!)" utters the driver, insinuating a general feeling of awe at the lights and at what Vegas conveys. The city is practically glowing, radiating there in the night as this green-horn rumbles on in for the first time looking to make it in the world of dancing and entertainment. The fact Nomi is too trusting of the gentleman, and that she loses at a game of slots in a casino at this very early time in her tenure here, cements her status as being completely out of her depth. Cut to six weeks later, and Nomi is staying with a friend whom she has met in Molly (Ravera). Backstage at a Vegas show, Nomi falls in love with her surroundings; surroundings of which have already fallen in love with that of Cristal Connors (Gershon), the establishment's star showgirl whose changing room is set away from the general chaos of other's and can muster up very little emotion when offered a bouquet of flowers for a latest performance. Such is, one feels, the quantity of past offerings of this ilk born out of this on-going adulation that this reaction is induced. It is here Nomi truly desires to be, it is here Cristal truly desires to stay: there can only be one true showgirl and when they get off on a somewhat negative first foot, battle commences. The film is essentially a string of second unit dance routines wherein very little is on but an awful lot is on show. Ultimately, this does little to raise the film above the level of usual American blockbuster fare - tits and arse are merely standing in for explosions and stunts. There are a number of scenes set at a pole dancing club owned by Al Torres, a slimy character played by Robert Davi  the very place at which Nomi must work if she is to hone her trade and get anywhere near places such as where Connors resides as queen of the stage. It's no secret the film enjoys these scenes, so much so that instead of actually probing as to why it is women might do this sort of work, or desire to be a superstar within these fields in the first place, we are instead invited to watch on; to join the punters and leer. A measure of how all over the place the film truly is lies in one specific sequence, wherein Davi's character briefly re-enters the heroine's life to stop and say hello for a minute. The guy was always a creep, and she was happy to be rid of him; but the romanticised tone as he once again re-enters the frame would suggest he's not all that bad, and that we should ourselves have missed him. I don't think so. Another odd moment arrives during a selection process sequence, when a male individual has for him a row of potential female dancers lined up for them so that he may cast his eye across and deduce whether they're fit for what the job demands  a sort of eerie syncing up with, one assumes, how the likes of Berkley and Gershon landed the roles of Nomi and Connors in the first place. The difference is that within the diegetic world of the film, a creep is at the helm of the project. Whereas one can lay little blame at the door of Paul Verhoven - someone whose female characters in Total Recall and Basic Instinct have been fun; feisty and often sexually charged without requiring the presence of rotten exploitation. The fallacy seems to fall with the fact those films depicted men first and foremost, with the dangerous women in their lives causing a chaos and such at the worst of times. Showgirls is, in a sense, constructed as if a 'men's picture'; a tale of two people vying for supremacy within a domain that pours lavish upon the dominant force and shoves the others to the back. Where Aronofsky's 2011 piece "Black Swan" nailed the case study, Showgirls just ends up being what it is: an overly long chore stuck between being a contemplative mediation and a skin flick, a film which depicts women whilst systematically striking us as not knowing the first thing about them.

    In 1995 'Showgirls' was the most controversial movie to ever come out of Hollywood. It's entire subject value had eyebrows lifting everywhere. The theme itself was a lure to many boys and men to rush to the theatre halls. The MPAA had a difficult time in rating the movie due to it's high sexually graphic nature presentation. I for sure had never seen so many women roam around topless so casually in a movie. No commercial movie to that day had I ever seen nudity depicted in a casual manner. I assume not many directors had the courage to do what Paul Verhoeven had attempted. He surely set a new standard and trend for cinema. But is is unfortunate that this did not become a long term frenzy. Without a doubt he made a daring movie which has gone beyond the realms of conventional cinema. Many would regard it as a true classic. The reason for this being that no other movie has chartered this territory even in the past 15 years. Paul Verhoeven is a competent director. Prior to his career in Hollywood he made movies on the genre of war and erotic natured movies. However I would rate his Hollywood career being his best. His first 2 movies 'Robocop' and 'Total Recall' were sci-fi. After that he made the box office hit 'Basic Instinct'. It's a surprising transition to move from sci-fi to erotic thrillers. But I guess it proves his versatility. 'Showgirls' obviously happened due to the success of 'Basic Instinct'. His collaboration with writer Joe Esterharez returned to the screen in full glare. Joe is a great writer and has always projected the different views of female empowerment in his novels. However the one flaw with 'Showgirls' is the script. Joe's one complaint with the movie was that he felt that sex and nudity camouflaged the small details in his novel. This made the plot appear thin and vague. The audiences admired the movie less for the plot but appreciated Elizabeth Berkeley performance. Mario Kassar is the executive producer this time round and also produced 'Basic Instinct' too. 'Showgirls' does not manage to recreate the magic of 'Basic Instinct'. But both movies are are different and the same team perhaps felt that this would be a profitable venture. The director manages the theme very well. Being a originally a outsider from the industry, he has brought life in to the movie with his creative skills and individual knowledge. The movies central theme is on Las Vegas showgirls. Rather than giving the movie the title 'strippers', 'Showgirls' was more of a respectable title. Vegas is renowned for it's casinos and gambling industry and employs a large number of people. As well as being a tourist attraction, it is also a wealthy state. The movie does not intend on exposing the seedy side but rather concentrates on showing the journey of a woman who is enthusiastic to become a high level showgirl. Many people she encounters throughout the movie are self centred and manipulative, but her character too has many negative qualities. Elizabeth Berkeley gives an honest performance. Her dancing abilities and acting skills are at their highest potential. Her portrayal as a ambitious and ruthless individual is very convincing. However she is not entirely a selfish person. She possesses feelings and demands respect like others too. Her performance is very inspiring and the manner in which she carries herself on screen is very professional. SPOILERS Nomi Malone played by (Elizabeth Berkeley) hitches a ride to Las Vegas. Her intentions are clear from the outset. She aims to become a popular Showgirl. A clothes designer Gina Revere lets her stay with her in her trailer. After enquiring at a few clubs and strip bars, Nomi gets the opportunity to dance at the Cheetah club. Robert Davi is the manager. Without wasting any time she becomes a professional dancer and catches the attention of everybody including Zack (kyle Mullikan) the entertainment manager and Crystal Conner s) Gina Gershon. Later she becomes lucky and gets the opportunity to audition for a showgirl position at the Stardust Hotel. She realises that it is not too easy and to become a high class dancer is very competitive. Her first dance is based on a volcano theme show. She electrifies on stage and becomes the highlight and talk of the town immediately. She becomes the media and people's favourite instantly. After spending a intimate night with Zack, she receives the lead position in a show. This upsets Crystal and she threatens Zack. This creates a conflict between Crystal and Nomi. After the show Nomi pushes Crystal down a flight of steps. This secures her position in the long term and leads to better things. However her friend Gina has a horrid encounter with her idolised singer, which makes Nomi think twice about her career and what consequences may occur if associating with the wrong people. END OF SPOILER This is Paul Verhoeven's less intellectual movies, as the content level is low in contrast to his previous movies. He gives an alternate view of his understanding of the entertainment business in Las Vegas. Under the glossy interiors lies a world that is full of people that are self centred, selfish and corrupt. It is awkward that Nomi feels strange when others behave towards her in the same manner. I could not understand why Esteharez shows Nomi's struggle as being too simple. She had to too easy for her. But I was convinced with her Short term struggles and I'm sure that many women may be able to relate to her character. The movie progresses at a moderate rate but the second hour is more productive as Nomi's character develops in to a complex phase. There are many dance sequences in the movie. They are pictured on a extravagant level.

    A momentous task in my life is done - I have watched Showgirls- and I have to say it was better than I expected but still not worthy of more than 3 stars. Let's start off with the lead actress (Elizabeth Berkly). She is the worst I have seen. She had one facial expression, sucked at trying to be serious, and couldn't dance her way out of hell(lots of huffing and puffing). I didn't even think she was that good looking, she has a horse- face. She had no grace at all and looked ridiculous in her role. The lead character, Nomi , said she wasn't a whore but oh she really played the whore/slut card pretty darn well throughout the whole movie. Every single character seemed to blend together and was lifeless. Really, there were no stand-out characters, they all were one-dimensional and had less expression than a plastic Barbie doll. There was nothing genuine about anyone, they were just trashy, self-centered, sex egotists, and didn't have the slightest emotional appeal. Throwing in that Andrew Carter guy was a very bad mistake as he served no purpose in the film and the background on him was non-existent. He was a big jerk to begin with and when he said "I like your ass", he turned out to be just a dirty- minded scumbag who thinks of women as nothing more than something to grab onto and enjoy. At least he got his ass kicked by Nomi. Surprisingly, this movie proved to have some entertainment value, albeit in a different sort of way. Lots of sexy dancing and adult oriented behavior but other than that the movie seemed to drag on for more than its worth. The first time I saw the nudity and sexual scenes, I was like "Yeah, this movie isn't so bad" but then it started to be poured on and on, relentlessly, making it hard to watch. It's hard to appreciate the beauty of seeing some naked body parts on screen when you're almost seeing it the entire time. It should be treated as a reward for watching the film, that is built up to instead of making it look trashy and tasteless. Even for me it got to be kind of sickening to see all of those women walking around naked for a half hour. The plot was just plain stupid. Nomi, a drifter supposedly from New York, comes to Las Vegas wanting to become a dancer and has to climb the ladder and fight the odds to become a top Vegas showgirl. For what? Is she that trashy and desperate for a living that she has to resort to selling her body? And it was played out in even worse fashion. The jokes and humor in this film were crude and just plain unfunny. Who came up with "she looks better than a ten inch dick and you know it"? That ugly hoe popping her boobs out again and again was supposed to be funny? Terrible script and actors/actresses alike who were about as exciting and thoughtful as a glass of water. There were some highlights, if any, in this movie that seemed to hold up what was a essentially a piece of garbage film that I'll never see again. The dancing was sensational, and the Elvis-look- alike guy in the truck was cool...and...well...that's about it. The costume design was downright trashy and it seemed like every flashy dance scene had the women stripping off their clothes and being groped all over. Only a movie to see in your private time. This movie doesn't even deserve an NC-17 rating, if you even call this a "movie". It wouldn't even qualify as a good porn film. It was like a bunch of D-list actors thrown together who don't know where they are going or what to do. They just partied, danced and what not until it was over. There was no chemistry between any of the characters and the progression of getting to know any of them was lackluster. There is so much more wrong with this film but that would probably take a while to write about so I'm just going to say this movie should not be on anyone's wish list. It is the movie that should be banned all across the world (and space if there are civilizations out there). Guard your sons, guard your daughters, this movie is the god of everything terrible and an example of bad-movie making to learn from. A trashy film that even landfills would be scared of. Why it spawned a sequel, I have no clue.

    Showgirls (1995) ** (out of 4) Paul Verhoeven's seriously intended but ultimate disaster about a young woman (Elizabeth Berkley) who arrives in Las Vegas with dreams of becoming a dancer but soon realizes the ugliness behind it. I've never found SHOWGIRLS to be the complete disaster that most people make it out to be. The reason for that is the film is simply way too boring to fit the "so bad it's good" range but at the same time there's no question that this thing contains some of the dumbest stuff you're ever going to see. How on Earth writer Joe Eszterhas ever expecting anyone to take this serious is beyond me because his screenplay has so many problems. For starters, it's basically just a poorly written remake of ALL ABOUT EVE and to make matters worse there's not a single second where you actually feel like you're getting a behind-the-scenes look at Vegas. Another problem is that the main character he wrote is so unlikeable that how are we supposed to care what happens to her? The first sequence with her alone is bad enough but then they follow it up with her going crazy on someone trying to help her. We then see her go off on countless others because she doesn't get what she wants and she just comes across as a psychotic brat and you certainly don't enjoy spending time with her. Then, another problem, is Berkley who just doesn't have the acting talent to pull the role off. I'm not sure a vet could have made this character work but when you still someone like Berkley into it it just becomes all the more bad. Not for a second did you ever feel her in the role and she certainly never brought it to life. Gina Gershon is certainly the best thing in the film but supporting players Kyle MacLachlan, Glenn Plummer and Robert Davi come off good as well. I think SHOWGIRLS would have worked much better had the filmmakers not taken it so serious. They shot for the Moon but came up well short and this here is where the majority of the laughs come from. This isn't one of the worst movies ever made but when 95% of your running time has naked women and it's still not erotic then that there should send a red flag up.

    You know, I'm a film buff and I've seen a lot of movies and I strongly claim that Showgirls is better than %80 of them. First of all it has a straight and fast-narrated story. Believe me, that's where most movies start to lag. The story begins from the very first scene and we learn that a girl in a shortage of money has come to Vegas to find a job as a dancer. This theme has an initial suspense in it which the script never lets it to fall down. Yet some may be bored by the dance scenes but personally I love dance and gaps made by dance sequences in films. From Godard's Band Apart which influenced the dance scene In Pulp Fiction to the Travolta's nice moves in Saturday Night Fever which is also an underrated film. Plus the group dances and choreographies are so fancy and erotic in Showgirls. My favorite one is when two main female characters participate on a stage show and the rivalry between them turns the dance moves into a sort of battle. About the eroticism in the movie, I think this is the aspect which has made everybody to give this title a low rating. But I really don't see Showgirl as a mere erotic picture. It has a story-teller script. The naked scenes are parts of the story. They are a part of the everyday life of characters and the environment surrounding them. Actually here is the point we can speak about the realism in the movie. Showgirls is a realistic movie, it's like a mirror that reflects the true hierarchy and competitions in the night club industry. But the kind of realism is not like Italian or French realism, it's Hollywoodian Realism. It does entertain you while giving you shocking facts about the subject. There are some great movies with similarities to Showgirls. First of all consider "All about Eve", which was made in 1950 about the replacement of generations and rivalry among the Theatre superstars. Some say Showgirls is a remake of All about Eve in a modern entertainment industry like Vegas show business. But personally I don't agree with them, the characteristics of two main female Characters in these movies are different. Another close film to our topic is "Casino" made by M.Scorsese at the same year that Showgirls was produced. Both pictures are made in Las Vegas in splendid and fancy sets and locations, and both have an intensive plot concerned with cruel industries. The irony is that Casino was celebrated by critics and nominated for several awards whereas Showgirls was deemed trash and a worthless sexual fantasy. I think it has the name of Scorsese as the director its reception was different. Although some figures like Tarantino have applauded the movie. "Boogie Nights" by Paul Thomas Anderson is also near to showgirls. It was shot 2 years after Paul Verhoeven's movie and I don't know whether Anderson had seen the other movie or not but if you like Boogie Nights I strongly recommend you to see Showgirls.

    "Who do you have to **** to get off this picture?" --attributed to Bette Davis Who did Elizabeth Berkley have to **** to get starred in "Showgirls"? The movie seems intended as a love letter to her, though I don't recall anyone in the 1990's saying, "Remember Jessie from 'Saved by the Bell'? God, I wish they'd get her into a porno flick so we could see what she's got!" What Berkley's got in "Showgirls" is a more explicit version of her petulance routine from that Saturday morning teen show. Berkley plays Nomi, a girl essentially from nowhere who wants to become a dancer. (And I do mean from nowhere. She has no family whatsoever, and later in the movie, another character has to explain to her what an M.B.A. is.) For no good reason, Nomi decides that becoming a dancer involves hitchhiking to Las Vegas. From that point, the script goes into two major loops. One is that, in one form or another, all the major characters have an obsession with either Nomi's dancing or her breasts. Either Nomi's being told how beautiful her chest is, or she's being told how much raw talent she has as a dancer. I don't know from Las Vegas, but having seen a few dancers and a few breasts in my day, my frank assessment is that Berkley is not outstanding in either department. The other loop is that Nomi is forever either showing off every inch of her lithe body or doing her best to simulate the sex act, only to go running off in anger every time somebody insinuates that she's a hooker. Now, where would anyone get that idea (other than her mentors requesting that she ice up her nipples before every show)? The movie's main, er, thrust is that Nomi works her way up to being a dancer in a show featuring what we're told is Vegas' star attraction, Cristal Connors (Gina Gershon). Eventually, we're told that Cristal has designs on Nomi, mainly so that screenwriter Joe Eszterhas and director Paul Verhoeven (the same enlightened team behind "Basic Instinct") can indulge their lip-smackin' woman-on-woman fantasies. From there, the movie goes into a hyper, NC-17 variation of "All About Eve," or what it would be if Bette Davis and Ann Baxter decided to get it on before they went into career damage control. Despite this movie's seedy reputation, it's not fun enough to be a "good" bad movie. It does have some Ed Wood-like dialogue whoppers -- when Nomi's old boss sees her hit the big time, he blithely comments, "It must be strange not to have someone c*** on you" -- but not enough to sit through this slop. Mostly, the movie makes you wonder how it dragged in actors such as Kyle MacLachlan, "L.A. Law's" Alan Rachins, and most notoriously, Gina Gershon who, with her big breasts and monotone line readings, comes off like Adrienne Barbeau's big sister.

    In a word: eeeeeew. This film will make you ashamed. Or at least it really, really should. One star is given with the word (awful) as an indicator - this film is exactly that - awful. What life itself cannot prepare you for is just how awful this is. Not only does everyone spend more time with their clothes off than on, there is a sadistically nasty streak to the whole thing - including a particularly nasty rape - that sucks all the joy and silliness out of it. I finally got around to watching it having avoided it for the best part of 20 years and now understand why that avoidance was a good thing. It is seriously one of the most utterly appalling films ever made and shows that it is possible to spend millions of dollars on nothing. I will never ever ever watch it again - it's not ironic, or cultic or anything. Just gave this reviewer chills as to how this project ever got greenlighted in the first place. I will not be watching the sequel either. A film only for desperately sad men.

    Sweet little Jesse Spano left the hole-some television series "Shaved By The Bell" in its last season to shave her snatch and dance around nakey for all to see. 22 yo Elizabeth Berkely has no problem waving her 22 yo box around for all of us in this touching story about strippers, cocaine, and a prostitute crackhead trying to turn over a new leaf in Sin City. HBO made an edited version that cuts out much of the story, and even more of her skin, so make sure to get the nasty NC-17 version that is hotter than a Havana Omelette on a dirty blonde's dirty butt-thole. Does the name Penny ring a bell for some reason? This 10 star slit-flick gets my gyno going' each and every time. The flacid jerk-off from "Sex and the City" that Charlotte marries gets a piece of 'ole Jesse, butt we don't mind, she's only about 10,000 times hotter and nastier than that ice-box Charlotte, and she'll kick your ass tunnel at the same time...uh oh, don't wanna give away too much of the goods at once - but that never stopped Elizabeth! Take my advice and come over to the girl-side; yes, yes, let the juice flow through you.

    Good intentions don't always equal good results. Sometimes there's a kink in the machine and you end up with a dud. If one tried to add up the number of films made with good intentions, they'd have a real sore behind. One of the most famous film disasters is this piece by famed director Paul Verhoeven. Intended to be a study of the world of Vegas showgirls, what it really is is a beautiful train wreck. It's like a skin flick with high production values and an A list director and cast. It's a shame the film didn't turn out the way the filmmakers planned, but that doesn't mean it isn't still a great time. Pros: Cast does it's best with the material. Dynamite direction. Concept with potential. Great score. Gorgeous cinematography. Equally stunning sets and costumes. High camp factor. Flows at a good pace. Cons: A lot of awful dialogue. Shallow, clich&eacute; filled script. Final thoughts: Let's not sugarcoat it folks; 'Showgirls' was never going to win any Oscars. With a script this bad, it's a wonder it even made it to the big screen. That aside, it's one of the most enjoyable bad movies of our time. It's pretty to look at and provides a few chuckles. It's also disturbing at times and fortunately those scenes are not played for laughs. Watch it alone or with friends, but do yourself a favor and watch it. My rating: 4/5

    Is the only way I can describe Elizabeth Berkley's so-called acting in this film!. The acting plummets from the moment she pulls out a knife and gives her best angry face in the first two minutes, the acting gets so cheesy it makes Jedward look like a formidable act. I know I seem far too critical but seriously at times the acting gets THAT bad you start feeling awkward, about as awkward when you watch a film with your parents and a nude scene pops up. I just think that the whole film is ruined by Elizabeth's poor acting and cheesy child like mood swings and hissy fits. The dancing looks awful Elizabeth is constantly looking stiff, angry and robotic. If you're looking for a cheap B list movie and a bit of skin then this may be the film for you but be warned the painful part is having to sit through watching it.

    Showgirls might have been a bit better had been the strip-o-gram equivalent of "The Long Good Friday", that is to say a film about someone at the top whose world dramatically falls apart when they thought they'd conquered enough to have it all. As it is, the film is an eerie cocksure mess of a picture; a film embracing the idea of women selling one's body as an appropriate career and a film on the side of women treading the grounds of a Las Vegas stage in order to demean their gender. This is, of course, after providing us with a heartless tract on pro-plastic surgery wherein falsity and such are the answers to life and that you're yet to make it in life should you not be donning the bright, sexy, exotic turf of a Nevada stage. This is one of those awkward projects wherein which the film is rubbish, and we know it's rubbish, but the film in question DOESN'T. The film is about the entry to; the living in, as well as the consequent dominating of, a very specific realm within the American city of Las Vegas perpetrated by a woman named Nomi (Berkley) who's in her twenties. Looking to hitch a ride with just about anyone at the film's outset, the film makes a point to capture just how na&iuml;ve she is at when the guy with whom she journeys swipes her belongings and drives off again. You have to wonder what he thought was in there for him - maybe he thought the case was worth something. Prior to all this, they cruise into town and lay eyes on Vegas for the first time: "There she is (!)" utters the driver, insinuating a general feeling of awe at the lights and at what Vegas conveys. The city is practically glowing, radiating there in the night as this green-horn rumbles on in for the first time looking to make it in the world of dancing and entertainment. The fact Nomi is too trusting of the gentleman, and that she loses at a game of slots in a casino at this very early time in her tenure here, cements her status as being completely out of her depth. Cut to six weeks later, and Nomi is staying with a friend whom she has met in Molly (Ravera). Backstage at a Vegas show, Nomi falls in love with her surroundings; surroundings of which have already fallen in love with that of Cristal Connors (Gershon), the establishment's star showgirl whose changing room is set away from the general chaos of other's and can muster up very little emotion when offered a bouquet of flowers for a latest performance. Such is, one feels, the quantity of past offerings of this ilk born out of this on-going adulation that this reaction is induced. It is here Nomi truly desires to be, it is here Cristal truly desires to stay: there can only be one true showgirl and when they get off on a somewhat negative first foot, battle commences. The film is essentially a string of second unit dance routines wherein very little is on but an awful lot is on show. Ultimately, this does little to raise the film above the level of usual American blockbuster fare - tits and arse are merely standing in for explosions and stunts. There are a number of scenes set at a pole dancing club owned by Al Torres, a slimy character played by Robert Davi  the very place at which Nomi must work if she is to hone her trade and get anywhere near places such as where Connors resides as queen of the stage. It's no secret the film enjoys these scenes, so much so that instead of actually probing as to why it is women might do this sort of work, or desire to be a superstar within these fields in the first place, we are instead invited to watch on; to join the punters and leer. A measure of how all over the place the film truly is lies in one specific sequence, wherein Davi's character briefly re-enters the heroine's life to stop and say hello for a minute. The guy was always a creep, and she was happy to be rid of him; but the romanticised tone as he once again re-enters the frame would suggest he's not all that bad, and that we should ourselves have missed him. I don't think so. Another odd moment arrives during a selection process sequence, when a male individual has for him a row of potential female dancers lined up for them so that he may cast his eye across and deduce whether they're fit for what the job demands  a sort of eerie syncing up with, one assumes, how the likes of Berkley and Gershon landed the roles of Nomi and Connors in the first place. The difference is that within the diegetic world of the film, a creep is at the helm of the project. Whereas one can lay little blame at the door of Paul Verhoven - someone whose female characters in Total Recall and Basic Instinct have been fun; feisty and often sexually charged without requiring the presence of rotten exploitation. The fallacy seems to fall with the fact those films depicted men first and foremost, with the dangerous women in their lives causing a chaos and such at the worst of times. Showgirls is, in a sense, constructed as if a 'men's picture'; a tale of two people vying for supremacy within a domain that pours lavish upon the dominant force and shoves the others to the back. Where Aronofsky's 2011 piece "Black Swan" nailed the case study, Showgirls just ends up being what it is: an overly long chore stuck between being a contemplative mediation and a skin flick, a film which depicts women whilst systematically striking us as not knowing the first thing about them.

    In 1995 'Showgirls' was the most controversial movie to ever come out of Hollywood. It's entire subject value had eyebrows lifting everywhere. The theme itself was a lure to many boys and men to rush to the theatre halls. The MPAA had a difficult time in rating the movie due to it's high sexually graphic nature presentation. I for sure had never seen so many women roam around topless so casually in a movie. No commercial movie to that day had I ever seen nudity depicted in a casual manner. I assume not many directors had the courage to do what Paul Verhoeven had attempted. He surely set a new standard and trend for cinema. But is is unfortunate that this did not become a long term frenzy. Without a doubt he made a daring movie which has gone beyond the realms of conventional cinema. Many would regard it as a true classic. The reason for this being that no other movie has chartered this territory even in the past 15 years. Paul Verhoeven is a competent director. Prior to his career in Hollywood he made movies on the genre of war and erotic natured movies. However I would rate his Hollywood career being his best. His first 2 movies 'Robocop' and 'Total Recall' were sci-fi. After that he made the box office hit 'Basic Instinct'. It's a surprising transition to move from sci-fi to erotic thrillers. But I guess it proves his versatility. 'Showgirls' obviously happened due to the success of 'Basic Instinct'. His collaboration with writer Joe Esterharez returned to the screen in full glare. Joe is a great writer and has always projected the different views of female empowerment in his novels. However the one flaw with 'Showgirls' is the script. Joe's one complaint with the movie was that he felt that sex and nudity camouflaged the small details in his novel. This made the plot appear thin and vague. The audiences admired the movie less for the plot but appreciated Elizabeth Berkeley performance. Mario Kassar is the executive producer this time round and also produced 'Basic Instinct' too. 'Showgirls' does not manage to recreate the magic of 'Basic Instinct'. But both movies are are different and the same team perhaps felt that this would be a profitable venture. The director manages the theme very well. Being a originally a outsider from the industry, he has brought life in to the movie with his creative skills and individual knowledge. The movies central theme is on Las Vegas showgirls. Rather than giving the movie the title 'strippers', 'Showgirls' was more of a respectable title. Vegas is renowned for it's casinos and gambling industry and employs a large number of people. As well as being a tourist attraction, it is also a wealthy state. The movie does not intend on exposing the seedy side but rather concentrates on showing the journey of a woman who is enthusiastic to become a high level showgirl. Many people she encounters throughout the movie are self centred and manipulative, but her character too has many negative qualities. Elizabeth Berkeley gives an honest performance. Her dancing abilities and acting skills are at their highest potential. Her portrayal as a ambitious and ruthless individual is very convincing. However she is not entirely a selfish person. She possesses feelings and demands respect like others too. Her performance is very inspiring and the manner in which she carries herself on screen is very professional. SPOILERS Nomi Malone played by (Elizabeth Berkeley) hitches a ride to Las Vegas. Her intentions are clear from the outset. She aims to become a popular Showgirl. A clothes designer Gina Revere lets her stay with her in her trailer. After enquiring at a few clubs and strip bars, Nomi gets the opportunity to dance at the Cheetah club. Robert Davi is the manager. Without wasting any time she becomes a professional dancer and catches the attention of everybody including Zack (kyle Mullikan) the entertainment manager and Crystal Conner s) Gina Gershon. Later she becomes lucky and gets the opportunity to audition for a showgirl position at the Stardust Hotel. She realises that it is not too easy and to become a high class dancer is very competitive. Her first dance is based on a volcano theme show. She electrifies on stage and becomes the highlight and talk of the town immediately. She becomes the media and people's favourite instantly. After spending a intimate night with Zack, she receives the lead position in a show. This upsets Crystal and she threatens Zack. This creates a conflict between Crystal and Nomi. After the show Nomi pushes Crystal down a flight of steps. This secures her position in the long term and leads to better things. However her friend Gina has a horrid encounter with her idolised singer, which makes Nomi think twice about her career and what consequences may occur if associating with the wrong people. END OF SPOILER This is Paul Verhoeven's less intellectual movies, as the content level is low in contrast to his previous movies. He gives an alternate view of his understanding of the entertainment business in Las Vegas. Under the glossy interiors lies a world that is full of people that are self centred, selfish and corrupt. It is awkward that Nomi feels strange when others behave towards her in the same manner. I could not understand why Esteharez shows Nomi's struggle as being too simple. She had to too easy for her. But I was convinced with her Short term struggles and I'm sure that many women may be able to relate to her character. The movie progresses at a moderate rate but the second hour is more productive as Nomi's character develops in to a complex phase. There are many dance sequences in the movie. They are pictured on a extravagant level.

    A momentous task in my life is done - I have watched Showgirls- and I have to say it was better than I expected but still not worthy of more than 3 stars. Let's start off with the lead actress (Elizabeth Berkly). She is the worst I have seen. She had one facial expression, sucked at trying to be serious, and couldn't dance her way out of hell(lots of huffing and puffing). I didn't even think she was that good looking, she has a horse- face. She had no grace at all and looked ridiculous in her role. The lead character, Nomi , said she wasn't a whore but oh she really played the whore/slut card pretty darn well throughout the whole movie. Every single character seemed to blend together and was lifeless. Really, there were no stand-out characters, they all were one-dimensional and had less expression than a plastic Barbie doll. There was nothing genuine about anyone, they were just trashy, self-centered, sex egotists, and didn't have the slightest emotional appeal. Throwing in that Andrew Carter guy was a very bad mistake as he served no purpose in the film and the background on him was non-existent. He was a big jerk to begin with and when he said "I like your ass", he turned out to be just a dirty- minded scumbag who thinks of women as nothing more than something to grab onto and enjoy. At least he got his ass kicked by Nomi. Surprisingly, this movie proved to have some entertainment value, albeit in a different sort of way. Lots of sexy dancing and adult oriented behavior but other than that the movie seemed to drag on for more than its worth. The first time I saw the nudity and sexual scenes, I was like "Yeah, this movie isn't so bad" but then it started to be poured on and on, relentlessly, making it hard to watch. It's hard to appreciate the beauty of seeing some naked body parts on screen when you're almost seeing it the entire time. It should be treated as a reward for watching the film, that is built up to instead of making it look trashy and tasteless. Even for me it got to be kind of sickening to see all of those women walking around naked for a half hour. The plot was just plain stupid. Nomi, a drifter supposedly from New York, comes to Las Vegas wanting to become a dancer and has to climb the ladder and fight the odds to become a top Vegas showgirl. For what? Is she that trashy and desperate for a living that she has to resort to selling her body? And it was played out in even worse fashion. The jokes and humor in this film were crude and just plain unfunny. Who came up with "she looks better than a ten inch dick and you know it"? That ugly hoe popping her boobs out again and again was supposed to be funny? Terrible script and actors/actresses alike who were about as exciting and thoughtful as a glass of water. There were some highlights, if any, in this movie that seemed to hold up what was a essentially a piece of garbage film that I'll never see again. The dancing was sensational, and the Elvis-look- alike guy in the truck was cool...and...well...that's about it. The costume design was downright trashy and it seemed like every flashy dance scene had the women stripping off their clothes and being groped all over. Only a movie to see in your private time. This movie doesn't even deserve an NC-17 rating, if you even call this a "movie". It wouldn't even qualify as a good porn film. It was like a bunch of D-list actors thrown together who don't know where they are going or what to do. They just partied, danced and what not until it was over. There was no chemistry between any of the characters and the progression of getting to know any of them was lackluster. There is so much more wrong with this film but that would probably take a while to write about so I'm just going to say this movie should not be on anyone's wish list. It is the movie that should be banned all across the world (and space if there are civilizations out there). Guard your sons, guard your daughters, this movie is the god of everything terrible and an example of bad-movie making to learn from. A trashy film that even landfills would be scared of. Why it spawned a sequel, I have no clue.

    Showgirls (1995) ** (out of 4) Paul Verhoeven's seriously intended but ultimate disaster about a young woman (Elizabeth Berkley) who arrives in Las Vegas with dreams of becoming a dancer but soon realizes the ugliness behind it. I've never found SHOWGIRLS to be the complete disaster that most people make it out to be. The reason for that is the film is simply way too boring to fit the "so bad it's good" range but at the same time there's no question that this thing contains some of the dumbest stuff you're ever going to see. How on Earth writer Joe Eszterhas ever expecting anyone to take this serious is beyond me because his screenplay has so many problems. For starters, it's basically just a poorly written remake of ALL ABOUT EVE and to make matters worse there's not a single second where you actually feel like you're getting a behind-the-scenes look at Vegas. Another problem is that the main character he wrote is so unlikeable that how are we supposed to care what happens to her? The first sequence with her alone is bad enough but then they follow it up with her going crazy on someone trying to help her. We then see her go off on countless others because she doesn't get what she wants and she just comes across as a psychotic brat and you certainly don't enjoy spending time with her. Then, another problem, is Berkley who just doesn't have the acting talent to pull the role off. I'm not sure a vet could have made this character work but when you still someone like Berkley into it it just becomes all the more bad. Not for a second did you ever feel her in the role and she certainly never brought it to life. Gina Gershon is certainly the best thing in the film but supporting players Kyle MacLachlan, Glenn Plummer and Robert Davi come off good as well. I think SHOWGIRLS would have worked much better had the filmmakers not taken it so serious. They shot for the Moon but came up well short and this here is where the majority of the laughs come from. This isn't one of the worst movies ever made but when 95% of your running time has naked women and it's still not erotic then that there should send a red flag up.

    You know, I'm a film buff and I've seen a lot of movies and I strongly claim that Showgirls is better than %80 of them. First of all it has a straight and fast-narrated story. Believe me, that's where most movies start to lag. The story begins from the very first scene and we learn that a girl in a shortage of money has come to Vegas to find a job as a dancer. This theme has an initial suspense in it which the script never lets it to fall down. Yet some may be bored by the dance scenes but personally I love dance and gaps made by dance sequences in films. From Godard's Band Apart which influenced the dance scene In Pulp Fiction to the Travolta's nice moves in Saturday Night Fever which is also an underrated film. Plus the group dances and choreographies are so fancy and erotic in Showgirls. My favorite one is when two main female characters participate on a stage show and the rivalry between them turns the dance moves into a sort of battle. About the eroticism in the movie, I think this is the aspect which has made everybody to give this title a low rating. But I really don't see Showgirl as a mere erotic picture. It has a story-teller script. The naked scenes are parts of the story. They are a part of the everyday life of characters and the environment surrounding them. Actually here is the point we can speak about the realism in the movie. Showgirls is a realistic movie, it's like a mirror that reflects the true hierarchy and competitions in the night club industry. But the kind of realism is not like Italian or French realism, it's Hollywoodian Realism. It does entertain you while giving you shocking facts about the subject. There are some great movies with similarities to Showgirls. First of all consider "All about Eve", which was made in 1950 about the replacement of generations and rivalry among the Theatre superstars. Some say Showgirls is a remake of All about Eve in a modern entertainment industry like Vegas show business. But personally I don't agree with them, the characteristics of two main female Characters in these movies are different. Another close film to our topic is "Casino" made by M.Scorsese at the same year that Showgirls was produced. Both pictures are made in Las Vegas in splendid and fancy sets and locations, and both have an intensive plot concerned with cruel industries. The irony is that Casino was celebrated by critics and nominated for several awards whereas Showgirls was deemed trash and a worthless sexual fantasy. I think it has the name of Scorsese as the director its reception was different. Although some figures like Tarantino have applauded the movie. "Boogie Nights" by Paul Thomas Anderson is also near to showgirls. It was shot 2 years after Paul Verhoeven's movie and I don't know whether Anderson had seen the other movie or not but if you like Boogie Nights I strongly recommend you to see Showgirls.

    "Who do you have to **** to get off this picture?" --attributed to Bette Davis Who did Elizabeth Berkley have to **** to get starred in "Showgirls"? The movie seems intended as a love letter to her, though I don't recall anyone in the 1990's saying, "Remember Jessie from 'Saved by the Bell'? God, I wish they'd get her into a porno flick so we could see what she's got!" What Berkley's got in "Showgirls" is a more explicit version of her petulance routine from that Saturday morning teen show. Berkley plays Nomi, a girl essentially from nowhere who wants to become a dancer. (And I do mean from nowhere. She has no family whatsoever, and later in the movie, another character has to explain to her what an M.B.A. is.) For no good reason, Nomi decides that becoming a dancer involves hitchhiking to Las Vegas. From that point, the script goes into two major loops. One is that, in one form or another, all the major characters have an obsession with either Nomi's dancing or her breasts. Either Nomi's being told how beautiful her chest is, or she's being told how much raw talent she has as a dancer. I don't know from Las Vegas, but having seen a few dancers and a few breasts in my day, my frank assessment is that Berkley is not outstanding in either department. The other loop is that Nomi is forever either showing off every inch of her lithe body or doing her best to simulate the sex act, only to go running off in anger every time somebody insinuates that she's a hooker. Now, where would anyone get that idea (other than her mentors requesting that she ice up her nipples before every show)? The movie's main, er, thrust is that Nomi works her way up to being a dancer in a show featuring what we're told is Vegas' star attraction, Cristal Connors (Gina Gershon). Eventually, we're told that Cristal has designs on Nomi, mainly so that screenwriter Joe Eszterhas and director Paul Verhoeven (the same enlightened team behind "Basic Instinct") can indulge their lip-smackin' woman-on-woman fantasies. From there, the movie goes into a hyper, NC-17 variation of "All About Eve," or what it would be if Bette Davis and Ann Baxter decided to get it on before they went into career damage control. Despite this movie's seedy reputation, it's not fun enough to be a "good" bad movie. It does have some Ed Wood-like dialogue whoppers -- when Nomi's old boss sees her hit the big time, he blithely comments, "It must be strange not to have someone c*** on you" -- but not enough to sit through this slop. Mostly, the movie makes you wonder how it dragged in actors such as Kyle MacLachlan, "L.A. Law's" Alan Rachins, and most notoriously, Gina Gershon who, with her big breasts and monotone line readings, comes off like Adrienne Barbeau's big sister.

    In a word: eeeeeew. This film will make you ashamed. Or at least it really, really should. One star is given with the word (awful) as an indicator - this film is exactly that - awful. What life itself cannot prepare you for is just how awful this is. Not only does everyone spend more time with their clothes off than on, there is a sadistically nasty streak to the whole thing - including a particularly nasty rape - that sucks all the joy and silliness out of it. I finally got around to watching it having avoided it for the best part of 20 years and now understand why that avoidance was a good thing. It is seriously one of the most utterly appalling films ever made and shows that it is possible to spend millions of dollars on nothing. I will never ever ever watch it again - it's not ironic, or cultic or anything. Just gave this reviewer chills as to how this project ever got greenlighted in the first place. I will not be watching the sequel either. A film only for desperately sad men.

    Sweet little Jesse Spano left the hole-some television series "Shaved By The Bell" in its last season to shave her snatch and dance around nakey for all to see. 22 yo Elizabeth Berkely has no problem waving her 22 yo box around for all of us in this touching story about strippers, cocaine, and a prostitute crackhead trying to turn over a new leaf in Sin City. HBO made an edited version that cuts out much of the story, and even more of her skin, so make sure to get the nasty NC-17 version that is hotter than a Havana Omelette on a dirty blonde's dirty butt-thole. Does the name Penny ring a bell for some reason? This 10 star slit-flick gets my gyno going' each and every time. The flacid jerk-off from "Sex and the City" that Charlotte marries gets a piece of 'ole Jesse, butt we don't mind, she's only about 10,000 times hotter and nastier than that ice-box Charlotte, and she'll kick your ass tunnel at the same time...uh oh, don't wanna give away too much of the goods at once - but that never stopped Elizabeth! Take my advice and come over to the girl-side; yes, yes, let the juice flow through you.

    Good intentions don't always equal good results. Sometimes there's a kink in the machine and you end up with a dud. If one tried to add up the number of films made with good intentions, they'd have a real sore behind. One of the most famous film disasters is this piece by famed director Paul Verhoeven. Intended to be a study of the world of Vegas showgirls, what it really is is a beautiful train wreck. It's like a skin flick with high production values and an A list director and cast. It's a shame the film didn't turn out the way the filmmakers planned, but that doesn't mean it isn't still a great time. Pros: Cast does it's best with the material. Dynamite direction. Concept with potential. Great score. Gorgeous cinematography. Equally stunning sets and costumes. High camp factor. Flows at a good pace. Cons: A lot of awful dialogue. Shallow, clich&eacute; filled script. Final thoughts: Let's not sugarcoat it folks; 'Showgirls' was never going to win any Oscars. With a script this bad, it's a wonder it even made it to the big screen. That aside, it's one of the most enjoyable bad movies of our time. It's pretty to look at and provides a few chuckles. It's also disturbing at times and fortunately those scenes are not played for laughs. Watch it alone or with friends, but do yourself a favor and watch it. My rating: 4/5

    Is the only way I can describe Elizabeth Berkley's so-called acting in this film!. The acting plummets from the moment she pulls out a knife and gives her best angry face in the first two minutes, the acting gets so cheesy it makes Jedward look like a formidable act. I know I seem far too critical but seriously at times the acting gets THAT bad you start feeling awkward, about as awkward when you watch a film with your parents and a nude scene pops up. I just think that the whole film is ruined by Elizabeth's poor acting and cheesy child like mood swings and hissy fits. The dancing looks awful Elizabeth is constantly looking stiff, angry and robotic. If you're looking for a cheap B list movie and a bit of skin then this may be the film for you but be warned the painful part is having to sit through watching it.

    Showgirls might have been a bit better had been the strip-o-gram equivalent of "The Long Good Friday", that is to say a film about someone at the top whose world dramatically falls apart when they thought they'd conquered enough to have it all. As it is, the film is an eerie cocksure mess of a picture; a film embracing the idea of women selling one's body as an appropriate career and a film on the side of women treading the grounds of a Las Vegas stage in order to demean their gender. This is, of course, after providing us with a heartless tract on pro-plastic surgery wherein falsity and such are the answers to life and that you're yet to make it in life should you not be donning the bright, sexy, exotic turf of a Nevada stage. This is one of those awkward projects wherein which the film is rubbish, and we know it's rubbish, but the film in question DOESN'T. The film is about the entry to; the living in, as well as the consequent dominating of, a very specific realm within the American city of Las Vegas perpetrated by a woman named Nomi (Berkley) who's in her twenties. Looking to hitch a ride with just about anyone at the film's outset, the film makes a point to capture just how na&iuml;ve she is at when the guy with whom she journeys swipes her belongings and drives off again. You have to wonder what he thought was in there for him - maybe he thought the case was worth something. Prior to all this, they cruise into town and lay eyes on Vegas for the first time: "There she is (!)" utters the driver, insinuating a general feeling of awe at the lights and at what Vegas conveys. The city is practically glowing, radiating there in the night as this green-horn rumbles on in for the first time looking to make it in the world of dancing and entertainment. The fact Nomi is too trusting of the gentleman, and that she loses at a game of slots in a casino at this very early time in her tenure here, cements her status as being completely out of her depth. Cut to six weeks later, and Nomi is staying with a friend whom she has met in Molly (Ravera). Backstage at a Vegas show, Nomi falls in love with her surroundings; surroundings of which have already fallen in love with that of Cristal Connors (Gershon), the establishment's star showgirl whose changing room is set away from the general chaos of other's and can muster up very little emotion when offered a bouquet of flowers for a latest performance. Such is, one feels, the quantity of past offerings of this ilk born out of this on-going adulation that this reaction is induced. It is here Nomi truly desires to be, it is here Cristal truly desires to stay: there can only be one true showgirl and when they get off on a somewhat negative first foot, battle commences. The film is essentially a string of second unit dance routines wherein very little is on but an awful lot is on show. Ultimately, this does little to raise the film above the level of usual American blockbuster fare - tits and arse are merely standing in for explosions and stunts. There are a number of scenes set at a pole dancing club owned by Al Torres, a slimy character played by Robert Davi  the very place at which Nomi must work if she is to hone her trade and get anywhere near places such as where Connors resides as queen of the stage. It's no secret the film enjoys these scenes, so much so that instead of actually probing as to why it is women might do this sort of work, or desire to be a superstar within these fields in the first place, we are instead invited to watch on; to join the punters and leer. A measure of how all over the place the film truly is lies in one specific sequence, wherein Davi's character briefly re-enters the heroine's life to stop and say hello for a minute. The guy was always a creep, and she was happy to be rid of him; but the romanticised tone as he once again re-enters the frame would suggest he's not all that bad, and that we should ourselves have missed him. I don't think so. Another odd moment arrives during a selection process sequence, when a male individual has for him a row of potential female dancers lined up for them so that he may cast his eye across and deduce whether they're fit for what the job demands  a sort of eerie syncing up with, one assumes, how the likes of Berkley and Gershon landed the roles of Nomi and Connors in the first place. The difference is that within the diegetic world of the film, a creep is at the helm of the project. Whereas one can lay little blame at the door of Paul Verhoven - someone whose female characters in Total Recall and Basic Instinct have been fun; feisty and often sexually charged without requiring the presence of rotten exploitation. The fallacy seems to fall with the fact those films depicted men first and foremost, with the dangerous women in their lives causing a chaos and such at the worst of times. Showgirls is, in a sense, constructed as if a 'men's picture'; a tale of two people vying for supremacy within a domain that pours lavish upon the dominant force and shoves the others to the back. Where Aronofsky's 2011 piece "Black Swan" nailed the case study, Showgirls just ends up being what it is: an overly long chore stuck between being a contemplative mediation and a skin flick, a film which depicts women whilst systematically striking us as not knowing the first thing about them.

    In 1995 'Showgirls' was the most controversial movie to ever come out of Hollywood. It's entire subject value had eyebrows lifting everywhere. The theme itself was a lure to many boys and men to rush to the theatre halls. The MPAA had a difficult time in rating the movie due to it's high sexually graphic nature presentation. I for sure had never seen so many women roam around topless so casually in a movie. No commercial movie to that day had I ever seen nudity depicted in a casual manner. I assume not many directors had the courage to do what Paul Verhoeven had attempted. He surely set a new standard and trend for cinema. But is is unfortunate that this did not become a long term frenzy. Without a doubt he made a daring movie which has gone beyond the realms of conventional cinema. Many would regard it as a true classic. The reason for this being that no other movie has chartered this territory even in the past 15 years. Paul Verhoeven is a competent director. Prior to his career in Hollywood he made movies on the genre of war and erotic natured movies. However I would rate his Hollywood career being his best. His first 2 movies 'Robocop' and 'Total Recall' were sci-fi. After that he made the box office hit 'Basic Instinct'. It's a surprising transition to move from sci-fi to erotic thrillers. But I guess it proves his versatility. 'Showgirls' obviously happened due to the success of 'Basic Instinct'. His collaboration with writer Joe Esterharez returned to the screen in full glare. Joe is a great writer and has always projected the different views of female empowerment in his novels. However the one flaw with 'Showgirls' is the script. Joe's one complaint with the movie was that he felt that sex and nudity camouflaged the small details in his novel. This made the plot appear thin and vague. The audiences admired the movie less for the plot but appreciated Elizabeth Berkeley performance. Mario Kassar is the executive producer this time round and also produced 'Basic Instinct' too. 'Showgirls' does not manage to recreate the magic of 'Basic Instinct'. But both movies are are different and the same team perhaps felt that this would be a profitable venture. The director manages the theme very well. Being a originally a outsider from the industry, he has brought life in to the movie with his creative skills and individual knowledge. The movies central theme is on Las Vegas showgirls. Rather than giving the movie the title 'strippers', 'Showgirls' was more of a respectable title. Vegas is renowned for it's casinos and gambling industry and employs a large number of people. As well as being a tourist attraction, it is also a wealthy state. The movie does not intend on exposing the seedy side but rather concentrates on showing the journey of a woman who is enthusiastic to become a high level showgirl. Many people she encounters throughout the movie are self centred and manipulative, but her character too has many negative qualities. Elizabeth Berkeley gives an honest performance. Her dancing abilities and acting skills are at their highest potential. Her portrayal as a ambitious and ruthless individual is very convincing. However she is not entirely a selfish person. She possesses feelings and demands respect like others too. Her performance is very inspiring and the manner in which she carries herself on screen is very professional. SPOILERS Nomi Malone played by (Elizabeth Berkeley) hitches a ride to Las Vegas. Her intentions are clear from the outset. She aims to become a popular Showgirl. A clothes designer Gina Revere lets her stay with her in her trailer. After enquiring at a few clubs and strip bars, Nomi gets the opportunity to dance at the Cheetah club. Robert Davi is the manager. Without wasting any time she becomes a professional dancer and catches the attention of everybody including Zack (kyle Mullikan) the entertainment manager and Crystal Conner s) Gina Gershon. Later she becomes lucky and gets the opportunity to audition for a showgirl position at the Stardust Hotel. She realises that it is not too easy and to become a high class dancer is very competitive. Her first dance is based on a volcano theme show. She electrifies on stage and becomes the highlight and talk of the town immediately. She becomes the media and people's favourite instantly. After spending a intimate night with Zack, she receives the lead position in a show. This upsets Crystal and she threatens Zack. This creates a conflict between Crystal and Nomi. After the show Nomi pushes Crystal down a flight of steps. This secures her position in the long term and leads to better things. However her friend Gina has a horrid encounter with her idolised singer, which makes Nomi think twice about her career and what consequences may occur if associating with the wrong people. END OF SPOILER This is Paul Verhoeven's less intellectual movies, as the content level is low in contrast to his previous movies. He gives an alternate view of his understanding of the entertainment business in Las Vegas. Under the glossy interiors lies a world that is full of people that are self centred, selfish and corrupt. It is awkward that Nomi feels strange when others behave towards her in the same manner. I could not understand why Esteharez shows Nomi's struggle as being too simple. She had to too easy for her. But I was convinced with her Short term struggles and I'm sure that many women may be able to relate to her character. The movie progresses at a moderate rate but the second hour is more productive as Nomi's character develops in to a complex phase. There are many dance sequences in the movie. They are pictured on a extravagant level.

    A momentous task in my life is done - I have watched Showgirls- and I have to say it was better than I expected but still not worthy of more than 3 stars. Let's start off with the lead actress (Elizabeth Berkly). She is the worst I have seen. She had one facial expression, sucked at trying to be serious, and couldn't dance her way out of hell(lots of huffing and puffing). I didn't even think she was that good looking, she has a horse- face. She had no grace at all and looked ridiculous in her role. The lead character, Nomi , said she wasn't a whore but oh she really played the whore/slut card pretty darn well throughout the whole movie. Every single character seemed to blend together and was lifeless. Really, there were no stand-out characters, they all were one-dimensional and had less expression than a plastic Barbie doll. There was nothing genuine about anyone, they were just trashy, self-centered, sex egotists, and didn't have the slightest emotional appeal. Throwing in that Andrew Carter guy was a very bad mistake as he served no purpose in the film and the background on him was non-existent. He was a big jerk to begin with and when he said "I like your ass", he turned out to be just a dirty- minded scumbag who thinks of women as nothing more than something to grab onto and enjoy. At least he got his ass kicked by Nomi. Surprisingly, this movie proved to have some entertainment value, albeit in a different sort of way. Lots of sexy dancing and adult oriented behavior but other than that the movie seemed to drag on for more than its worth. The first time I saw the nudity and sexual scenes, I was like "Yeah, this movie isn't so bad" but then it started to be poured on and on, relentlessly, making it hard to watch. It's hard to appreciate the beauty of seeing some naked body parts on screen when you're almost seeing it the entire time. It should be treated as a reward for watching the film, that is built up to instead of making it look trashy and tasteless. Even for me it got to be kind of sickening to see all of those women walking around naked for a half hour. The plot was just plain stupid. Nomi, a drifter supposedly from New York, comes to Las Vegas wanting to become a dancer and has to climb the ladder and fight the odds to become a top Vegas showgirl. For what? Is she that trashy and desperate for a living that she has to resort to selling her body? And it was played out in even worse fashion. The jokes and humor in this film were crude and just plain unfunny. Who came up with "she looks better than a ten inch dick and you know it"? That ugly hoe popping her boobs out again and again was supposed to be funny? Terrible script and actors/actresses alike who were about as exciting and thoughtful as a glass of water. There were some highlights, if any, in this movie that seemed to hold up what was a essentially a piece of garbage film that I'll never see again. The dancing was sensational, and the Elvis-look- alike guy in the truck was cool...and...well...that's about it. The costume design was downright trashy and it seemed like every flashy dance scene had the women stripping off their clothes and being groped all over. Only a movie to see in your private time. This movie doesn't even deserve an NC-17 rating, if you even call this a "movie". It wouldn't even qualify as a good porn film. It was like a bunch of D-list actors thrown together who don't know where they are going or what to do. They just partied, danced and what not until it was over. There was no chemistry between any of the characters and the progression of getting to know any of them was lackluster. There is so much more wrong with this film but that would probably take a while to write about so I'm just going to say this movie should not be on anyone's wish list. It is the movie that should be banned all across the world (and space if there are civilizations out there). Guard your sons, guard your daughters, this movie is the god of everything terrible and an example of bad-movie making to learn from. A trashy film that even landfills would be scared of. Why it spawned a sequel, I have no clue.

    Showgirls (1995) ** (out of 4) Paul Verhoeven's seriously intended but ultimate disaster about a young woman (Elizabeth Berkley) who arrives in Las Vegas with dreams of becoming a dancer but soon realizes the ugliness behind it. I've never found SHOWGIRLS to be the complete disaster that most people make it out to be. The reason for that is the film is simply way too boring to fit the "so bad it's good" range but at the same time there's no question that this thing contains some of the dumbest stuff you're ever going to see. How on Earth writer Joe Eszterhas ever expecting anyone to take this serious is beyond me because his screenplay has so many problems. For starters, it's basically just a poorly written remake of ALL ABOUT EVE and to make matters worse there's not a single second where you actually feel like you're getting a behind-the-scenes look at Vegas. Another problem is that the main character he wrote is so unlikeable that how are we supposed to care what happens to her? The first sequence with her alone is bad enough but then they follow it up with her going crazy on someone trying to help her. We then see her go off on countless others because she doesn't get what she wants and she just comes across as a psychotic brat and you certainly don't enjoy spending time with her. Then, another problem, is Berkley who just doesn't have the acting talent to pull the role off. I'm not sure a vet could have made this character work but when you still someone like Berkley into it it just becomes all the more bad. Not for a second did you ever feel her in the role and she certainly never brought it to life. Gina Gershon is certainly the best thing in the film but supporting players Kyle MacLachlan, Glenn Plummer and Robert Davi come off good as well. I think SHOWGIRLS would have worked much better had the filmmakers not taken it so serious. They shot for the Moon but came up well short and this here is where the majority of the laughs come from. This isn't one of the worst movies ever made but when 95% of your running time has naked women and it's still not erotic then that there should send a red flag up.

    You know, I'm a film buff and I've seen a lot of movies and I strongly claim that Showgirls is better than %80 of them. First of all it has a straight and fast-narrated story. Believe me, that's where most movies start to lag. The story begins from the very first scene and we learn that a girl in a shortage of money has come to Vegas to find a job as a dancer. This theme has an initial suspense in it which the script never lets it to fall down. Yet some may be bored by the dance scenes but personally I love dance and gaps made by dance sequences in films. From Godard's Band Apart which influenced the dance scene In Pulp Fiction to the Travolta's nice moves in Saturday Night Fever which is also an underrated film. Plus the group dances and choreographies are so fancy and erotic in Showgirls. My favorite one is when two main female characters participate on a stage show and the rivalry between them turns the dance moves into a sort of battle. About the eroticism in the movie, I think this is the aspect which has made everybody to give this title a low rating. But I really don't see Showgirl as a mere erotic picture. It has a story-teller script. The naked scenes are parts of the story. They are a part of the everyday life of characters and the environment surrounding them. Actually here is the point we can speak about the realism in the movie. Showgirls is a realistic movie, it's like a mirror that reflects the true hierarchy and competitions in the night club industry. But the kind of realism is not like Italian or French realism, it's Hollywoodian Realism. It does entertain you while giving you shocking facts about the subject. There are some great movies with similarities to Showgirls. First of all consider "All about Eve", which was made in 1950 about the replacement of generations and rivalry among the Theatre superstars. Some say Showgirls is a remake of All about Eve in a modern entertainment industry like Vegas show business. But personally I don't agree with them, the characteristics of two main female Characters in these movies are different. Another close film to our topic is "Casino" made by M.Scorsese at the same year that Showgirls was produced. Both pictures are made in Las Vegas in splendid and fancy sets and locations, and both have an intensive plot concerned with cruel industries. The irony is that Casino was celebrated by critics and nominated for several awards whereas Showgirls was deemed trash and a worthless sexual fantasy. I think it has the name of Scorsese as the director its reception was different. Although some figures like Tarantino have applauded the movie. "Boogie Nights" by Paul Thomas Anderson is also near to showgirls. It was shot 2 years after Paul Verhoeven's movie and I don't know whether Anderson had seen the other movie or not but if you like Boogie Nights I strongly recommend you to see Showgirls.

    "Who do you have to **** to get off this picture?" --attributed to Bette Davis Who did Elizabeth Berkley have to **** to get starred in "Showgirls"? The movie seems intended as a love letter to her, though I don't recall anyone in the 1990's saying, "Remember Jessie from 'Saved by the Bell'? God, I wish they'd get her into a porno flick so we could see what she's got!" What Berkley's got in "Showgirls" is a more explicit version of her petulance routine from that Saturday morning teen show. Berkley plays Nomi, a girl essentially from nowhere who wants to become a dancer. (And I do mean from nowhere. She has no family whatsoever, and later in the movie, another character has to explain to her what an M.B.A. is.) For no good reason, Nomi decides that becoming a dancer involves hitchhiking to Las Vegas. From that point, the script goes into two major loops. One is that, in one form or another, all the major characters have an obsession with either Nomi's dancing or her breasts. Either Nomi's being told how beautiful her chest is, or she's being told how much raw talent she has as a dancer. I don't know from Las Vegas, but having seen a few dancers and a few breasts in my day, my frank assessment is that Berkley is not outstanding in either department. The other loop is that Nomi is forever either showing off every inch of her lithe body or doing her best to simulate the sex act, only to go running off in anger every time somebody insinuates that she's a hooker. Now, where would anyone get that idea (other than her mentors requesting that she ice up her nipples before every show)? The movie's main, er, thrust is that Nomi works her way up to being a dancer in a show featuring what we're told is Vegas' star attraction, Cristal Connors (Gina Gershon). Eventually, we're told that Cristal has designs on Nomi, mainly so that screenwriter Joe Eszterhas and director Paul Verhoeven (the same enlightened team behind "Basic Instinct") can indulge their lip-smackin' woman-on-woman fantasies. From there, the movie goes into a hyper, NC-17 variation of "All About Eve," or what it would be if Bette Davis and Ann Baxter decided to get it on before they went into career damage control. Despite this movie's seedy reputation, it's not fun enough to be a "good" bad movie. It does have some Ed Wood-like dialogue whoppers -- when Nomi's old boss sees her hit the big time, he blithely comments, "It must be strange not to have someone c*** on you" -- but not enough to sit through this slop. Mostly, the movie makes you wonder how it dragged in actors such as Kyle MacLachlan, "L.A. Law's" Alan Rachins, and most notoriously, Gina Gershon who, with her big breasts and monotone line readings, comes off like Adrienne Barbeau's big sister.

    In a word: eeeeeew. This film will make you ashamed. Or at least it really, really should. One star is given with the word (awful) as an indicator - this film is exactly that - awful. What life itself cannot prepare you for is just how awful this is. Not only does everyone spend more time with their clothes off than on, there is a sadistically nasty streak to the whole thing - including a particularly nasty rape - that sucks all the joy and silliness out of it. I finally got around to watching it having avoided it for the best part of 20 years and now understand why that avoidance was a good thing. It is seriously one of the most utterly appalling films ever made and shows that it is possible to spend millions of dollars on nothing. I will never ever ever watch it again - it's not ironic, or cultic or anything. Just gave this reviewer chills as to how this project ever got greenlighted in the first place. I will not be watching the sequel either. A film only for desperately sad men.

    Sweet little Jesse Spano left the hole-some television series "Shaved By The Bell" in its last season to shave her snatch and dance around nakey for all to see. 22 yo Elizabeth Berkely has no problem waving her 22 yo box around for all of us in this touching story about strippers, cocaine, and a prostitute crackhead trying to turn over a new leaf in Sin City. HBO made an edited version that cuts out much of the story, and even more of her skin, so make sure to get the nasty NC-17 version that is hotter than a Havana Omelette on a dirty blonde's dirty butt-thole. Does the name Penny ring a bell for some reason? This 10 star slit-flick gets my gyno going' each and every time. The flacid jerk-off from "Sex and the City" that Charlotte marries gets a piece of 'ole Jesse, butt we don't mind, she's only about 10,000 times hotter and nastier than that ice-box Charlotte, and she'll kick your ass tunnel at the same time...uh oh, don't wanna give away too much of the goods at once - but that never stopped Elizabeth! Take my advice and come over to the girl-side; yes, yes, let the juice flow through you.

    Good intentions don't always equal good results. Sometimes there's a kink in the machine and you end up with a dud. If one tried to add up the number of films made with good intentions, they'd have a real sore behind. One of the most famous film disasters is this piece by famed director Paul Verhoeven. Intended to be a study of the world of Vegas showgirls, what it really is is a beautiful train wreck. It's like a skin flick with high production values and an A list director and cast. It's a shame the film didn't turn out the way the filmmakers planned, but that doesn't mean it isn't still a great time. Pros: Cast does it's best with the material. Dynamite direction. Concept with potential. Great score. Gorgeous cinematography. Equally stunning sets and costumes. High camp factor. Flows at a good pace. Cons: A lot of awful dialogue. Shallow, clich&eacute; filled script. Final thoughts: Let's not sugarcoat it folks; 'Showgirls' was never going to win any Oscars. With a script this bad, it's a wonder it even made it to the big screen. That aside, it's one of the most enjoyable bad movies of our time. It's pretty to look at and provides a few chuckles. It's also disturbing at times and fortunately those scenes are not played for laughs. Watch it alone or with friends, but do yourself a favor and watch it. My rating: 4/5

    Is the only way I can describe Elizabeth Berkley's so-called acting in this film!. The acting plummets from the moment she pulls out a knife and gives her best angry face in the first two minutes, the acting gets so cheesy it makes Jedward look like a formidable act. I know I seem far too critical but seriously at times the acting gets THAT bad you start feeling awkward, about as awkward when you watch a film with your parents and a nude scene pops up. I just think that the whole film is ruined by Elizabeth's poor acting and cheesy child like mood swings and hissy fits. The dancing looks awful Elizabeth is constantly looking stiff, angry and robotic. If you're looking for a cheap B list movie and a bit of skin then this may be the film for you but be warned the painful part is having to sit through watching it.

    Showgirls might have been a bit better had been the strip-o-gram equivalent of "The Long Good Friday", that is to say a film about someone at the top whose world dramatically falls apart when they thought they'd conquered enough to have it all. As it is, the film is an eerie cocksure mess of a picture; a film embracing the idea of women selling one's body as an appropriate career and a film on the side of women treading the grounds of a Las Vegas stage in order to demean their gender. This is, of course, after providing us with a heartless tract on pro-plastic surgery wherein falsity and such are the answers to life and that you're yet to make it in life should you not be donning the bright, sexy, exotic turf of a Nevada stage. This is one of those awkward projects wherein which the film is rubbish, and we know it's rubbish, but the film in question DOESN'T. The film is about the entry to; the living in, as well as the consequent dominating of, a very specific realm within the American city of Las Vegas perpetrated by a woman named Nomi (Berkley) who's in her twenties. Looking to hitch a ride with just about anyone at the film's outset, the film makes a point to capture just how na&iuml;ve she is at when the guy with whom she journeys swipes her belongings and drives off again. You have to wonder what he thought was in there for him - maybe he thought the case was worth something. Prior to all this, they cruise into town and lay eyes on Vegas for the first time: "There she is (!)" utters the driver, insinuating a general feeling of awe at the lights and at what Vegas conveys. The city is practically glowing, radiating there in the night as this green-horn rumbles on in for the first time looking to make it in the world of dancing and entertainment. The fact Nomi is too trusting of the gentleman, and that she loses at a game of slots in a casino at this very early time in her tenure here, cements her status as being completely out of her depth. Cut to six weeks later, and Nomi is staying with a friend whom she has met in Molly (Ravera). Backstage at a Vegas show, Nomi falls in love with her surroundings; surroundings of which have already fallen in love with that of Cristal Connors (Gershon), the establishment's star showgirl whose changing room is set away from the general chaos of other's and can muster up very little emotion when offered a bouquet of flowers for a latest performance. Such is, one feels, the quantity of past offerings of this ilk born out of this on-going adulation that this reaction is induced. It is here Nomi truly desires to be, it is here Cristal truly desires to stay: there can only be one true showgirl and when they get off on a somewhat negative first foot, battle commences. The film is essentially a string of second unit dance routines wherein very little is on but an awful lot is on show. Ultimately, this does little to raise the film above the level of usual American blockbuster fare - tits and arse are merely standing in for explosions and stunts. There are a number of scenes set at a pole dancing club owned by Al Torres, a slimy character played by Robert Davi  the very place at which Nomi must work if she is to hone her trade and get anywhere near places such as where Connors resides as queen of the stage. It's no secret the film enjoys these scenes, so much so that instead of actually probing as to why it is women might do this sort of work, or desire to be a superstar within these fields in the first place, we are instead invited to watch on; to join the punters and leer. A measure of how all over the place the film truly is lies in one specific sequence, wherein Davi's character briefly re-enters the heroine's life to stop and say hello for a minute. The guy was always a creep, and she was happy to be rid of him; but the romanticised tone as he once again re-enters the frame would suggest he's not all that bad, and that we should ourselves have missed him. I don't think so. Another odd moment arrives during a selection process sequence, when a male individual has for him a row of potential female dancers lined up for them so that he may cast his eye across and deduce whether they're fit for what the job demands  a sort of eerie syncing up with, one assumes, how the likes of Berkley and Gershon landed the roles of Nomi and Connors in the first place. The difference is that within the diegetic world of the film, a creep is at the helm of the project. Whereas one can lay little blame at the door of Paul Verhoven - someone whose female characters in Total Recall and Basic Instinct have been fun; feisty and often sexually charged without requiring the presence of rotten exploitation. The fallacy seems to fall with the fact those films depicted men first and foremost, with the dangerous women in their lives causing a chaos and such at the worst of times. Showgirls is, in a sense, constructed as if a 'men's picture'; a tale of two people vying for supremacy within a domain that pours lavish upon the dominant force and shoves the others to the back. Where Aronofsky's 2011 piece "Black Swan" nailed the case study, Showgirls just ends up being what it is: an overly long chore stuck between being a contemplative mediation and a skin flick, a film which depicts women whilst systematically striking us as not knowing the first thing about them.

    In 1995 'Showgirls' was the most controversial movie to ever come out of Hollywood. It's entire subject value had eyebrows lifting everywhere. The theme itself was a lure to many boys and men to rush to the theatre halls. The MPAA had a difficult time in rating the movie due to it's high sexually graphic nature presentation. I for sure had never seen so many women roam around topless so casually in a movie. No commercial movie to that day had I ever seen nudity depicted in a casual manner. I assume not many directors had the courage to do what Paul Verhoeven had attempted. He surely set a new standard and trend for cinema. But is is unfortunate that this did not become a long term frenzy. Without a doubt he made a daring movie which has gone beyond the realms of conventional cinema. Many would regard it as a true classic. The reason for this being that no other movie has chartered this territory even in the past 15 years. Paul Verhoeven is a competent director. Prior to his career in Hollywood he made movies on the genre of war and erotic natured movies. However I would rate his Hollywood career being his best. His first 2 movies 'Robocop' and 'Total Recall' were sci-fi. After that he made the box office hit 'Basic Instinct'. It's a surprising transition to move from sci-fi to erotic thrillers. But I guess it proves his versatility. 'Showgirls' obviously happened due to the success of 'Basic Instinct'. His collaboration with writer Joe Esterharez returned to the screen in full glare. Joe is a great writer and has always projected the different views of female empowerment in his novels. However the one flaw with 'Showgirls' is the script. Joe's one complaint with the movie was that he felt that sex and nudity camouflaged the small details in his novel. This made the plot appear thin and vague. The audiences admired the movie less for the plot but appreciated Elizabeth Berkeley performance. Mario Kassar is the executive producer this time round and also produced 'Basic Instinct' too. 'Showgirls' does not manage to recreate the magic of 'Basic Instinct'. But both movies are are different and the same team perhaps felt that this would be a profitable venture. The director manages the theme very well. Being a originally a outsider from the industry, he has brought life in to the movie with his creative skills and individual knowledge. The movies central theme is on Las Vegas showgirls. Rather than giving the movie the title 'strippers', 'Showgirls' was more of a respectable title. Vegas is renowned for it's casinos and gambling industry and employs a large number of people. As well as being a tourist attraction, it is also a wealthy state. The movie does not intend on exposing the seedy side but rather concentrates on showing the journey of a woman who is enthusiastic to become a high level showgirl. Many people she encounters throughout the movie are self centred and manipulative, but her character too has many negative qualities. Elizabeth Berkeley gives an honest performance. Her dancing abilities and acting skills are at their highest potential. Her portrayal as a ambitious and ruthless individual is very convincing. However she is not entirely a selfish person. She possesses feelings and demands respect like others too. Her performance is very inspiring and the manner in which she carries herself on screen is very professional. SPOILERS Nomi Malone played by (Elizabeth Berkeley) hitches a ride to Las Vegas. Her intentions are clear from the outset. She aims to become a popular Showgirl. A clothes designer Gina Revere lets her stay with her in her trailer. After enquiring at a few clubs and strip bars, Nomi gets the opportunity to dance at the Cheetah club. Robert Davi is the manager. Without wasting any time she becomes a professional dancer and catches the attention of everybody including Zack (kyle Mullikan) the entertainment manager and Crystal Conner s) Gina Gershon. Later she becomes lucky and gets the opportunity to audition for a showgirl position at the Stardust Hotel. She realises that it is not too easy and to become a high class dancer is very competitive. Her first dance is based on a volcano theme show. She electrifies on stage and becomes the highlight and talk of the town immediately. She becomes the media and people's favourite instantly. After spending a intimate night with Zack, she receives the lead position in a show. This upsets Crystal and she threatens Zack. This creates a conflict between Crystal and Nomi. After the show Nomi pushes Crystal down a flight of steps. This secures her position in the long term and leads to better things. However her friend Gina has a horrid encounter with her idolised singer, which makes Nomi think twice about her career and what consequences may occur if associating with the wrong people. END OF SPOILER This is Paul Verhoeven's less intellectual movies, as the content level is low in contrast to his previous movies. He gives an alternate view of his understanding of the entertainment business in Las Vegas. Under the glossy interiors lies a world that is full of people that are self centred, selfish and corrupt. It is awkward that Nomi feels strange when others behave towards her in the same manner. I could not understand why Esteharez shows Nomi's struggle as being too simple. She had to too easy for her. But I was convinced with her Short term struggles and I'm sure that many women may be able to relate to her character. The movie progresses at a moderate rate but the second hour is more productive as Nomi's character develops in to a complex phase. There are many dance sequences in the movie. They are pictured on a extravagant level.

    A momentous task in my life is done - I have watched Showgirls- and I have to say it was better than I expected but still not worthy of more than 3 stars. Let's start off with the lead actress (Elizabeth Berkly). She is the worst I have seen. She had one facial expression, sucked at trying to be serious, and couldn't dance her way out of hell(lots of huffing and puffing). I didn't even think she was that good looking, she has a horse- face. She had no grace at all and looked ridiculous in her role. The lead character, Nomi , said she wasn't a whore but oh she really played the whore/slut card pretty darn well throughout the whole movie. Every single character seemed to blend together and was lifeless. Really, there were no stand-out characters, they all were one-dimensional and had less expression than a plastic Barbie doll. There was nothing genuine about anyone, they were just trashy, self-centered, sex egotists, and didn't have the slightest emotional appeal. Throwing in that Andrew Carter guy was a very bad mistake as he served no purpose in the film and the background on him was non-existent. He was a big jerk to begin with and when he said "I like your ass", he turned out to be just a dirty- minded scumbag who thinks of women as nothing more than something to grab onto and enjoy. At least he got his ass kicked by Nomi. Surprisingly, this movie proved to have some entertainment value, albeit in a different sort of way. Lots of sexy dancing and adult oriented behavior but other than that the movie seemed to drag on for more than its worth. The first time I saw the nudity and sexual scenes, I was like "Yeah, this movie isn't so bad" but then it started to be poured on and on, relentlessly, making it hard to watch. It's hard to appreciate the beauty of seeing some naked body parts on screen when you're almost seeing it the entire time. It should be treated as a reward for watching the film, that is built up to instead of making it look trashy and tasteless. Even for me it got to be kind of sickening to see all of those women walking around naked for a half hour. The plot was just plain stupid. Nomi, a drifter supposedly from New York, comes to Las Vegas wanting to become a dancer and has to climb the ladder and fight the odds to become a top Vegas showgirl. For what? Is she that trashy and desperate for a living that she has to resort to selling her body? And it was played out in even worse fashion. The jokes and humor in this film were crude and just plain unfunny. Who came up with "she looks better than a ten inch dick and you know it"? That ugly hoe popping her boobs out again and again was supposed to be funny? Terrible script and actors/actresses alike who were about as exciting and thoughtful as a glass of water. There were some highlights, if any, in this movie that seemed to hold up what was a essentially a piece of garbage film that I'll never see again. The dancing was sensational, and the Elvis-look- alike guy in the truck was cool...and...well...that's about it. The costume design was downright trashy and it seemed like every flashy dance scene had the women stripping off their clothes and being groped all over. Only a movie to see in your private time. This movie doesn't even deserve an NC-17 rating, if you even call this a "movie". It wouldn't even qualify as a good porn film. It was like a bunch of D-list actors thrown together who don't know where they are going or what to do. They just partied, danced and what not until it was over. There was no chemistry between any of the characters and the progression of getting to know any of them was lackluster. There is so much more wrong with this film but that would probably take a while to write about so I'm just going to say this movie should not be on anyone's wish list. It is the movie that should be banned all across the world (and space if there are civilizations out there). Guard your sons, guard your daughters, this movie is the god of everything terrible and an example of bad-movie making to learn from. A trashy film that even landfills would be scared of. Why it spawned a sequel, I have no clue.

    Showgirls (1995) ** (out of 4) Paul Verhoeven's seriously intended but ultimate disaster about a young woman (Elizabeth Berkley) who arrives in Las Vegas with dreams of becoming a dancer but soon realizes the ugliness behind it. I've never found SHOWGIRLS to be the complete disaster that most people make it out to be. The reason for that is the film is simply way too boring to fit the "so bad it's good" range but at the same time there's no question that this thing contains some of the dumbest stuff you're ever going to see. How on Earth writer Joe Eszterhas ever expecting anyone to take this serious is beyond me because his screenplay has so many problems. For starters, it's basically just a poorly written remake of ALL ABOUT EVE and to make matters worse there's not a single second where you actually feel like you're getting a behind-the-scenes look at Vegas. Another problem is that the main character he wrote is so unlikeable that how are we supposed to care what happens to her? The first sequence with her alone is bad enough but then they follow it up with her going crazy on someone trying to help her. We then see her go off on countless others because she doesn't get what she wants and she just comes across as a psychotic brat and you certainly don't enjoy spending time with her. Then, another problem, is Berkley who just doesn't have the acting talent to pull the role off. I'm not sure a vet could have made this character work but when you still someone like Berkley into it it just becomes all the more bad. Not for a second did you ever feel her in the role and she certainly never brought it to life. Gina Gershon is certainly the best thing in the film but supporting players Kyle MacLachlan, Glenn Plummer and Robert Davi come off good as well. I think SHOWGIRLS would have worked much better had the filmmakers not taken it so serious. They shot for the Moon but came up well short and this here is where the majority of the laughs come from. This isn't one of the worst movies ever made but when 95% of your running time has naked women and it's still not erotic then that there should send a red flag up.

    You know, I'm a film buff and I've seen a lot of movies and I strongly claim that Showgirls is better than %80 of them. First of all it has a straight and fast-narrated story. Believe me, that's where most movies start to lag. The story begins from the very first scene and we learn that a girl in a shortage of money has come to Vegas to find a job as a dancer. This theme has an initial suspense in it which the script never lets it to fall down. Yet some may be bored by the dance scenes but personally I love dance and gaps made by dance sequences in films. From Godard's Band Apart which influenced the dance scene In Pulp Fiction to the Travolta's nice moves in Saturday Night Fever which is also an underrated film. Plus the group dances and choreographies are so fancy and erotic in Showgirls. My favorite one is when two main female characters participate on a stage show and the rivalry between them turns the dance moves into a sort of battle. About the eroticism in the movie, I think this is the aspect which has made everybody to give this title a low rating. But I really don't see Showgirl as a mere erotic picture. It has a story-teller script. The naked scenes are parts of the story. They are a part of the everyday life of characters and the environment surrounding them. Actually here is the point we can speak about the realism in the movie. Showgirls is a realistic movie, it's like a mirror that reflects the true hierarchy and competitions in the night club industry. But the kind of realism is not like Italian or French realism, it's Hollywoodian Realism. It does entertain you while giving you shocking facts about the subject. There are some great movies with similarities to Showgirls. First of all consider "All about Eve", which was made in 1950 about the replacement of generations and rivalry among the Theatre superstars. Some say Showgirls is a remake of All about Eve in a modern entertainment industry like Vegas show business. But personally I don't agree with them, the characteristics of two main female Characters in these movies are different. Another close film to our topic is "Casino" made by M.Scorsese at the same year that Showgirls was produced. Both pictures are made in Las Vegas in splendid and fancy sets and locations, and both have an intensive plot concerned with cruel industries. The irony is that Casino was celebrated by critics and nominated for several awards whereas Showgirls was deemed trash and a worthless sexual fantasy. I think it has the name of Scorsese as the director its reception was different. Although some figures like Tarantino have applauded the movie. "Boogie Nights" by Paul Thomas Anderson is also near to showgirls. It was shot 2 years after Paul Verhoeven's movie and I don't know whether Anderson had seen the other movie or not but if you like Boogie Nights I strongly recommend you to see Showgirls.

    "Who do you have to **** to get off this picture?" --attributed to Bette Davis Who did Elizabeth Berkley have to **** to get starred in "Showgirls"? The movie seems intended as a love letter to her, though I don't recall anyone in the 1990's saying, "Remember Jessie from 'Saved by the Bell'? God, I wish they'd get her into a porno flick so we could see what she's got!" What Berkley's got in "Showgirls" is a more explicit version of her petulance routine from that Saturday morning teen show. Berkley plays Nomi, a girl essentially from nowhere who wants to become a dancer. (And I do mean from nowhere. She has no family whatsoever, and later in the movie, another character has to explain to her what an M.B.A. is.) For no good reason, Nomi decides that becoming a dancer involves hitchhiking to Las Vegas. From that point, the script goes into two major loops. One is that, in one form or another, all the major characters have an obsession with either Nomi's dancing or her breasts. Either Nomi's being told how beautiful her chest is, or she's being told how much raw talent she has as a dancer. I don't know from Las Vegas, but having seen a few dancers and a few breasts in my day, my frank assessment is that Berkley is not outstanding in either department. The other loop is that Nomi is forever either showing off every inch of her lithe body or doing her best to simulate the sex act, only to go running off in anger every time somebody insinuates that she's a hooker. Now, where would anyone get that idea (other than her mentors requesting that she ice up her nipples before every show)? The movie's main, er, thrust is that Nomi works her way up to being a dancer in a show featuring what we're told is Vegas' star attraction, Cristal Connors (Gina Gershon). Eventually, we're told that Cristal has designs on Nomi, mainly so that screenwriter Joe Eszterhas and director Paul Verhoeven (the same enlightened team behind "Basic Instinct") can indulge their lip-smackin' woman-on-woman fantasies. From there, the movie goes into a hyper, NC-17 variation of "All About Eve," or what it would be if Bette Davis and Ann Baxter decided to get it on before they went into career damage control. Despite this movie's seedy reputation, it's not fun enough to be a "good" bad movie. It does have some Ed Wood-like dialogue whoppers -- when Nomi's old boss sees her hit the big time, he blithely comments, "It must be strange not to have someone c*** on you" -- but not enough to sit through this slop. Mostly, the movie makes you wonder how it dragged in actors such as Kyle MacLachlan, "L.A. Law's" Alan Rachins, and most notoriously, Gina Gershon who, with her big breasts and monotone line readings, comes off like Adrienne Barbeau's big sister.

    In a word: eeeeeew. This film will make you ashamed. Or at least it really, really should. One star is given with the word (awful) as an indicator - this film is exactly that - awful. What life itself cannot prepare you for is just how awful this is. Not only does everyone spend more time with their clothes off than on, there is a sadistically nasty streak to the whole thing - including a particularly nasty rape - that sucks all the joy and silliness out of it. I finally got around to watching it having avoided it for the best part of 20 years and now understand why that avoidance was a good thing. It is seriously one of the most utterly appalling films ever made and shows that it is possible to spend millions of dollars on nothing. I will never ever ever watch it again - it's not ironic, or cultic or anything. Just gave this reviewer chills as to how this project ever got greenlighted in the first place. I will not be watching the sequel either. A film only for desperately sad men.

    Sweet little Jesse Spano left the hole-some television series "Shaved By The Bell" in its last season to shave her snatch and dance around nakey for all to see. 22 yo Elizabeth Berkely has no problem waving her 22 yo box around for all of us in this touching story about strippers, cocaine, and a prostitute crackhead trying to turn over a new leaf in Sin City. HBO made an edited version that cuts out much of the story, and even more of her skin, so make sure to get the nasty NC-17 version that is hotter than a Havana Omelette on a dirty blonde's dirty butt-thole. Does the name Penny ring a bell for some reason? This 10 star slit-flick gets my gyno going' each and every time. The flacid jerk-off from "Sex and the City" that Charlotte marries gets a piece of 'ole Jesse, butt we don't mind, she's only about 10,000 times hotter and nastier than that ice-box Charlotte, and she'll kick your ass tunnel at the same time...uh oh, don't wanna give away too much of the goods at once - but that never stopped Elizabeth! Take my advice and come over to the girl-side; yes, yes, let the juice flow through you.
