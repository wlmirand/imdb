    Raymond Lembecke (Vincent Gallo) just got out of prison. His girlfriend is Addy Monroe (Kim Dickens). Curtis Freley (Kiefer Sutherland) is a psychopath. Together with Marcus Weans (Mykelti Williamson), the four rob a drug dealer of his drugs. The problem is that a cop was working undercover there, and everybody was killed. Now on the run, they carjack an RV with a couple on board (Kevin Pollak, Grace Phillips). This is a Kiefer's first time directing effort for a full length film. It has it's moments but there isn't anything special and it doesn't flow. The story jerks from one thing to another. Some of it doesn't really make sense. For example when they leave the RV and take the pickup, they left the pickup driver and kept the RV couple. They must know that if they leave the pickup driver, the cops would zero in on the pickup immediately. This was stupid and added nothing to the story. Kiefer should have stayed with the RV in the story.

    David from Germany certainly doesn't do this film justice. For the record, the coin standing on its edge anecdote does have a payback later in the movie, to justify itself. There is a great cast who develop believable characters, as far as I'm concerned. I think Kiefer did an excellent job acting, as well as, directing; and, I'm sorry the movie wasn't given a bigger promotional budget and a broader distribution. The story of a drug deal gone bad may seem hackneyed; but, the love relationship between the criminal couple makes it all work.

    This is the kind of movie that you stumble upon, on basic cable, at 3am, when nothing but infomercials are on: entertaining enough to keep watching, though very predictable, clich&eacute;s up the wazoo, the plot has been done to death, in better movies, and the acting is mostly flat (save for Keifer Sutherland). The excessive violence and gore were a nice touch (I'm a big Tarantino fan, so that explains that), but ultimately, nothing can earn this movie even 5 stars out of 10, because its just written badly and poorly executed, so I'm going with 4 stars, because I didn't absolutely hate it and Vincent Gallo was hot and in his prime, in this movie. A MUCH better drug movie is Drugstore Cowboy (1989).

    Somewhat underrated, if derivative, this first time Directorial effort from the slightly off-center Actor, who will, for at least the foreseeable future be associated with the extremely popular TV Series 24, is a not that bad Crime/Road Movie. There are some glaring ineffectiveness here and there, mostly coming from the badly written Pulpy Dialog. Some of the Pop Culture references and the extended talky Scenes come off as embarrassing rather than insightful. The "Stockholm Syndrome" element is also played out with some unbelievable and forced developments. But there are some interesting Characters, the least of which is the DEA infiltrator overacted and annoying, that are engaging enough. The Violence is gritty if over stylized, and is attractive Action Movie stuff with guns blazing and squibs squibbing. Another weakness is the God-Awful Music, from the sappy slow Ballads to the Road Music, it is badly selected and intrusive. Overall though, this delivers enough Gangster stuff to be Entertaining and should have a more accepting approval than it does from Critics and intolerable nit-pickers.

    I love American road movies. such cool. I enjoyed the scenes of the coin and what they said about the coin granting all knowing. And at end before he die he gets it and only sees his own death. wonderful done! I have come to see a lot of movies from new Mexico, united states. many i enjoy that are like this. the crime, the drama, the violence is like a beautiful death for all the characters. I was not sad from the death of all the characters. The writing is good and you root for the "villians" not the police. though it is tragic, the film was shot very beautifully. I think anyone who likes violent movies would enjoy this movie. Sutherlund is very scary as a villain character.

    Before I get into writing my thoughts on the movie, I should mention that I frequently watch violent "R" rated movies, and their content normally doesn't disturb me. However, the violent content in "Truth or Consequences, N.M." disturbed me. This is a movie that has no humanity at all. Characters are violently killed on a whim throughout, and the movie has no humanity at all. I think what really disturbed me was that this violent content was placed against a movie that otherwise wants to be a light-hearted romp, an attempt to emulate the style of "Pulp Fiction". But this movie is not made with Tarantino skill. It's just a simple-minded exercise with no wit, no insight, and just an excuse to follow repulsive characters for a 100 or so minutes. It's no wonder the distributor didn't give this much of a release.

    If you've ever seen the movie Reservoir Dogs, try and imagine what it would have been like if it had been written and directed by Chuck Norris. That will give you an inkling of what a colossal cornucopia of crap this film is. The movie opens with Ray (Vincent Gallo) getting out of prison, though the moment is treated like he's a star high school athlete on the final day of his senior year. Ray hooks up with his girlfriend Addy (Kim Dickens) and then it's suddenly 8 months later and Ray and Addy have joined with two other guys to try and rob the local drug dealer. Curtis (Kiefer Sutherland) is a kill-crazy half-wit and Marcus (Mykelti Williamson) is a black guy with an inexplicable ghetto accent. It sounds like 30% ebonics, 30% Jamaican and 60% speech impediment. The drug robbery goes wrong and Ray and company go on the run, kidnapping a couple named Gordon and Donna (Kevin Pollak and Grace Philips) and hijacking their RV. Rather than act like hostage and hostage-taker, everybody behaves like they're long lost cousins meeting again for a family reunion. Defying all reason and common sense, Ray and company keep dragging Gordon and Donna along with them as the criminals try and sell their stolen drugs and get out of the country before the cops and the criminals the drugs belonged to track them down. The movie then spirals into a pit of idiotic plotting, cheesy drama and unintentionally comic violence that would have fit perfectly into any random episode of Walker, Texas Ranger. In the nigh endless litany of things wrong with Truth or Consequences, N.M., I have to start with the acting. Vincent Gallo is worthless. He has no screen presence and doesn't give an ounce of conviction to any line of dialog he recites. It's like he flunked out of the Quentin Tarantino School of Acting. He's also the least physically attractive guy in the whole cast, whether measured hetero- or homosexually. I've already mentioned Mykelti Williamson's bizarre accent. Most of Kiefer Sutherland's acting in this film is done by his hairdo, though he does let out a Jack Bauer growl on occasion. Martin Sheen plays a mob hit-man and has given better performances doing voiceovers for car commercials. There's not one single second when Kevin Pollak seems like a real person in this story. He could have been replaced by a muppet and not one of the good muppets, like Fozzie Bear. I mean Beaker or Scooter. As for the writingwell, I'm sure almost all of the words in the script were in the correct order and were accurately punctuated. It's a fiasco on every other level. None of the things that happen in this movie follow any logic except the dictates of the Almighty Plot Hammer. Characters are introduced out of nowhere. Important plot elements are mentioned 30 seconds before coming into play in the story. Foreshadowing is introduced and then abandoned. One clich&eacute; after another is piled up like a Pike's Peak of vapid screen writing. I don't think there's one well written instant in the entire movie. Sutherland's direction is vaguely adequate. Nothing looks really bad but nothing looks really good. You certainly wouldn't ever hire him to direct another film because of his work here, though you wouldn't automatically disregard him because of it either. Truth or Consequences, N.M. is just plain dreadful. Avoid it.

    If you like crime drama with lots of action with a little romance, then this movie is a good way to spend a couple of hours and a few bucks. Overall, the movie is very good. The story premise is excellent. A lot of interesting twists and surprises. I found myself not wanting to leave my seat for fear of missing something. The title does not come into play until late, but when it does, you get the point. All the actors did a superb job. Keifer Southerland does an absolutely superb job of acting. This guy is just fantastic. Cameos by Sheen were excellent. Of course, he can play anybody, anywhere, anytime and make you believe it... The story takes you on a cool road journey through the desert. I will not tell you how it ends, but it was good for my money any day. Buy it, rent it- whatever... Bottom line?... SEE IT. You will not be disappointed.

    How can you name a movie after a place, but never film there. I have lived in Truth or Consquences and take offense to this. It may not have been the best place in the world to live, but you have to take pride in what ever you can. Truth of Consquences didn't have to have a movie named after it to be famous. It was originally called Hot Spring, NM, but changed it's name to match a game show called Truth or Consequences. Don't get me wrong I liked the movie and I love Kiefer Sutherlands work, I just think that he should have at least filmed somewhere in New Mexico. I did not recognize the New Mexico location(having been 5 miles south of Truth or Consequences on highway 285), so I had to check the credits.

    There were defenantly some good moments in the movie, but it ended up just dragging on and on. There were also several scenes which didn't feel real, I just didn't think that they would happen in real life. After it was over, I was disappointed that I wasted my time. Though Keifer Sutherland was very good in the movie, and I rather enjoyed his character. All and all Don't waste your time with this movie, I doesn't hold any value, and you will probably be disappointed in the end. Its not just the fact that the ending wasn't very good, but the complete movie as a whole was not very entertaining.

    This is the kind of movie that you stumble upon, on basic cable, at 3am, when nothing but infomercials are on: entertaining enough to keep watching, though very predictable, clich&eacute;s up the wazoo, the plot has been done to death, in better movies, and the acting is mostly flat (save for Keifer Sutherland). The excessive violence and gore were a nice touch (I'm a big Tarantino fan, so that explains that), but ultimately, nothing can earn this movie even 5 stars out of 10, because its just written badly and poorly executed, so I'm going with 4 stars, because I didn't absolutely hate it and Vincent Gallo was hot and in his prime, in this movie. A MUCH better drug movie is Drugstore Cowboy (1989).

    Somewhat underrated, if derivative, this first time Directorial effort from the slightly off-center Actor, who will, for at least the foreseeable future be associated with the extremely popular TV Series 24, is a not that bad Crime/Road Movie. There are some glaring ineffectiveness here and there, mostly coming from the badly written Pulpy Dialog. Some of the Pop Culture references and the extended talky Scenes come off as embarrassing rather than insightful. The "Stockholm Syndrome" element is also played out with some unbelievable and forced developments. But there are some interesting Characters, the least of which is the DEA infiltrator overacted and annoying, that are engaging enough. The Violence is gritty if over stylized, and is attractive Action Movie stuff with guns blazing and squibs squibbing. Another weakness is the God-Awful Music, from the sappy slow Ballads to the Road Music, it is badly selected and intrusive. Overall though, this delivers enough Gangster stuff to be Entertaining and should have a more accepting approval than it does from Critics and intolerable nit-pickers.

    I love American road movies. such cool. I enjoyed the scenes of the coin and what they said about the coin granting all knowing. And at end before he die he gets it and only sees his own death. wonderful done! I have come to see a lot of movies from new Mexico, united states. many i enjoy that are like this. the crime, the drama, the violence is like a beautiful death for all the characters. I was not sad from the death of all the characters. The writing is good and you root for the "villians" not the police. though it is tragic, the film was shot very beautifully. I think anyone who likes violent movies would enjoy this movie. Sutherlund is very scary as a villain character.

    Before I get into writing my thoughts on the movie, I should mention that I frequently watch violent "R" rated movies, and their content normally doesn't disturb me. However, the violent content in "Truth or Consequences, N.M." disturbed me. This is a movie that has no humanity at all. Characters are violently killed on a whim throughout, and the movie has no humanity at all. I think what really disturbed me was that this violent content was placed against a movie that otherwise wants to be a light-hearted romp, an attempt to emulate the style of "Pulp Fiction". But this movie is not made with Tarantino skill. It's just a simple-minded exercise with no wit, no insight, and just an excuse to follow repulsive characters for a 100 or so minutes. It's no wonder the distributor didn't give this much of a release.

    If you've ever seen the movie Reservoir Dogs, try and imagine what it would have been like if it had been written and directed by Chuck Norris. That will give you an inkling of what a colossal cornucopia of crap this film is. The movie opens with Ray (Vincent Gallo) getting out of prison, though the moment is treated like he's a star high school athlete on the final day of his senior year. Ray hooks up with his girlfriend Addy (Kim Dickens) and then it's suddenly 8 months later and Ray and Addy have joined with two other guys to try and rob the local drug dealer. Curtis (Kiefer Sutherland) is a kill-crazy half-wit and Marcus (Mykelti Williamson) is a black guy with an inexplicable ghetto accent. It sounds like 30% ebonics, 30% Jamaican and 60% speech impediment. The drug robbery goes wrong and Ray and company go on the run, kidnapping a couple named Gordon and Donna (Kevin Pollak and Grace Philips) and hijacking their RV. Rather than act like hostage and hostage-taker, everybody behaves like they're long lost cousins meeting again for a family reunion. Defying all reason and common sense, Ray and company keep dragging Gordon and Donna along with them as the criminals try and sell their stolen drugs and get out of the country before the cops and the criminals the drugs belonged to track them down. The movie then spirals into a pit of idiotic plotting, cheesy drama and unintentionally comic violence that would have fit perfectly into any random episode of Walker, Texas Ranger. In the nigh endless litany of things wrong with Truth or Consequences, N.M., I have to start with the acting. Vincent Gallo is worthless. He has no screen presence and doesn't give an ounce of conviction to any line of dialog he recites. It's like he flunked out of the Quentin Tarantino School of Acting. He's also the least physically attractive guy in the whole cast, whether measured hetero- or homosexually. I've already mentioned Mykelti Williamson's bizarre accent. Most of Kiefer Sutherland's acting in this film is done by his hairdo, though he does let out a Jack Bauer growl on occasion. Martin Sheen plays a mob hit-man and has given better performances doing voiceovers for car commercials. There's not one single second when Kevin Pollak seems like a real person in this story. He could have been replaced by a muppet and not one of the good muppets, like Fozzie Bear. I mean Beaker or Scooter. As for the writingwell, I'm sure almost all of the words in the script were in the correct order and were accurately punctuated. It's a fiasco on every other level. None of the things that happen in this movie follow any logic except the dictates of the Almighty Plot Hammer. Characters are introduced out of nowhere. Important plot elements are mentioned 30 seconds before coming into play in the story. Foreshadowing is introduced and then abandoned. One clich&eacute; after another is piled up like a Pike's Peak of vapid screen writing. I don't think there's one well written instant in the entire movie. Sutherland's direction is vaguely adequate. Nothing looks really bad but nothing looks really good. You certainly wouldn't ever hire him to direct another film because of his work here, though you wouldn't automatically disregard him because of it either. Truth or Consequences, N.M. is just plain dreadful. Avoid it.

    If you like crime drama with lots of action with a little romance, then this movie is a good way to spend a couple of hours and a few bucks. Overall, the movie is very good. The story premise is excellent. A lot of interesting twists and surprises. I found myself not wanting to leave my seat for fear of missing something. The title does not come into play until late, but when it does, you get the point. All the actors did a superb job. Keifer Southerland does an absolutely superb job of acting. This guy is just fantastic. Cameos by Sheen were excellent. Of course, he can play anybody, anywhere, anytime and make you believe it... The story takes you on a cool road journey through the desert. I will not tell you how it ends, but it was good for my money any day. Buy it, rent it- whatever... Bottom line?... SEE IT. You will not be disappointed.

    How can you name a movie after a place, but never film there. I have lived in Truth or Consquences and take offense to this. It may not have been the best place in the world to live, but you have to take pride in what ever you can. Truth of Consquences didn't have to have a movie named after it to be famous. It was originally called Hot Spring, NM, but changed it's name to match a game show called Truth or Consequences. Don't get me wrong I liked the movie and I love Kiefer Sutherlands work, I just think that he should have at least filmed somewhere in New Mexico. I did not recognize the New Mexico location(having been 5 miles south of Truth or Consequences on highway 285), so I had to check the credits.

    There were defenantly some good moments in the movie, but it ended up just dragging on and on. There were also several scenes which didn't feel real, I just didn't think that they would happen in real life. After it was over, I was disappointed that I wasted my time. Though Keifer Sutherland was very good in the movie, and I rather enjoyed his character. All and all Don't waste your time with this movie, I doesn't hold any value, and you will probably be disappointed in the end. Its not just the fact that the ending wasn't very good, but the complete movie as a whole was not very entertaining.

    Raymond Lembecke (Vincent Gallo) just got out of prison. His girlfriend is Addy Monroe (Kim Dickens). Curtis Freley (Kiefer Sutherland) is a psychopath. Together with Marcus Weans (Mykelti Williamson), the four rob a drug dealer of his drugs. The problem is that a cop was working undercover there, and everybody was killed. Now on the run, they carjack an RV with a couple on board (Kevin Pollak, Grace Phillips). This is a Kiefer's first time directing effort for a full length film. It has it's moments but there isn't anything special and it doesn't flow. The story jerks from one thing to another. Some of it doesn't really make sense. For example when they leave the RV and take the pickup, they left the pickup driver and kept the RV couple. They must know that if they leave the pickup driver, the cops would zero in on the pickup immediately. This was stupid and added nothing to the story. Kiefer should have stayed with the RV in the story.

    David from Germany certainly doesn't do this film justice. For the record, the coin standing on its edge anecdote does have a payback later in the movie, to justify itself. There is a great cast who develop believable characters, as far as I'm concerned. I think Kiefer did an excellent job acting, as well as, directing; and, I'm sorry the movie wasn't given a bigger promotional budget and a broader distribution. The story of a drug deal gone bad may seem hackneyed; but, the love relationship between the criminal couple makes it all work.
