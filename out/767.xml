    This is how a vampire movie should be. It is very dark and grim and what makes it frightening is that it's realistic. Christopher Walken is great in this and the role is perfect for him. Lili Taylor is great too. But what really makes it stand out is the story as well as the cinematography. It's not really a vampire movie. It reminded me more of movies like "Requiem for a Dream". But it's not just a movie about drug abuse either, nor is it simply a philosophical movie. I must have watched this movie like 20 times (since it came out back in the day). And each time I watch it, it's interesting because I discover something new and interpret it in a new way. Nowhere in the movie does it mention that they are vampires. We just ASSUME they are vampires cause that is what we are expecting and that is how they look and behave. But then again they also look and behave like drug addicts and/or rapists. The movie starts with the question of why and how people are capable of war crimes, rape and other atrocities... and in the course of the movie you learn how and why. The ending is very interesting and had me thinking quite a bit before I figured it out. Of course I won't tell you... go watch it yourself. If you like horror movies that make you think about them and that don't need special effects to scare you, than this is well worth your time.

    I respect the user reviews here a lot. I am genuinely in the minority in not admiring this movie. I admire the work of Ferrara and many of the actors in it. However, I thought that the great Lily Taylor sounded fed-up and was simply reciting memorized pages of Philosophy for Dummies. There has to be some connection between the director and Dick Wolf or w/LAW AND ORDER FOR so many of the L&O actors to have been involved w/this project. Maybe it's D'Onofrio's connection w/Taylor and their masterwork, HOUSEHOLD SAINTS. I am pleased so many people find this an amazing work, but I just didn't get it.

    While trying to finish her thesis, a college student finds herself bitten by a vampire and tries to come to grips with the deadly affliction as she's mentored in the ways of their species and tries to avoid giving away her new identity. This one certainly has some pretty decent ways to go here, mainly through the use of the clever gimmick that gets this one over by having her compare vampirism through philosophical queries, but unfortunately that only has a two-pronged effect that doesn't do anything for the film at hand. On the one, it makes the film just incredibly boring and not really all that interesting, since she spends the majority of time simply doing nothing but complaining about the utterly useless knowledge given to her by the school and relying on other means to get through the change. Eventually, it all just comes across as pretentious nonsense that makes no sense at all and just tends to sound whatever it needed to do to agree with their principle ideas. The other factor, as mentioned before, is that not a lot happens in here and it tends to just ramble on, like she does, and nothing gets done because of that. Even the novel Black-and-White can't save this one. Rated R: Graphic Violence, Language, drug use and Brief Nudity.

    Vampires are essentially a romanticizing of abject psychopathy. They take pride in their "superiority" and, at best, feel somewhat sorry for their unfortunate but inferior prey. They just can't help themselves, of course, they are "victims of their own nature." When they observe normal, caring people with actual consciences, able to love one and other, able to sacrifice, able to believe in a higher power, they become enraged, which, to them justifies more predation. For some reason, we are attracted to sociopaths, whether it be portrayed by a politician, movie villain, serial murderer, bad boy with the tight jeans, or bad girl with the hard, gray eyes. Maybe it is their perceived power, maybe their life free from guilt, I don't know. But for whatever sociopaths (and vampires) are thick on the ground in modern movies and TV shows. I'm tired of them. This is just another movie about sociopaths, not even cute or sexy sociopaths, just sickies. Good acting (I love Walken and Taylor as actors, but despite its pretensions to philosophy, it is just another movie glorifying the coldness that resides in the hearts of some "humans".

    Abel Ferrara, the director of this art-house flick is best known for his banned movie The Driller Killer. Just before he made that he even directed a porn flick, so he surely knows what to do with a movie, another much talked about flick directed by him is Ms 45. And of course this arty flick is also much talked about. The story is so simple. Bitten unsuspectingly by a vampire and living with being a vampire. It's in black and white which of course gave it's art feeling but it is also a slow movie with some blood running now and then but it surely works due the perfect performances. The use of rap music (cypress hill) and real news footage (My Lai)also did it's work. Especially the news footage is not for the sqeaumish. It surely is worth watching, no special effects just a story being brought to you in a typical Abel way. A must see.

    From the director of 'Body Snatchers' and 'Bad Lieutenant' Abel Ferrara, comes a movie which is in the horror vein. Horror is not a theme which Ferrara is highly regarded for, however 'The addiction' rather tends to pursue giving a dictation on philosophical theories than intending to frighten the viewer. I first watched this when I was a student myself. This is one movie that can be appreciated for what exists underneath than watching people being bitten. Initially many will perceive this to be a vampire movie. But ones perception will be dependant on how he/she understands the concept. Shot in black and white, this has intended to give the movie a Gothic atmosphere. I personally felt that the black and white presentation eradicates a small proportion of the level of enjoyment that could have been experienced. SPOILERS The basic plot revolves around Lily Taylor who plays a philosophy student. On one night she is bitten by Annabelle Sciorra. From that night on the course of her life changes forever as she slowly begins to live life differently and acts in inhuman manners. She sucks blood from a few individuals and in between we hear quotes of philosophy that she narrates. In the end she attains her degree and indulges in a blood orgy at a get together party with a few of a revamped friends. I found it difficult to understand the final scene. My interpretation was quite confusing. I could not understand if Taylor was alive or dead. The movie ends on a strange piece of thought. But plot wise one should not expect much on it. END OF Spoiler This is one of Abel Ferrara's more intelligent and less appreciated movies. He had moved far away from the tacky material that he used to make in the 70s and 80s. Many may experience a unsettling feeling with the images of a graphic nature but this is part of what Taylor is studying. Lily Taylor gives a fine performance and her constant body movements expressing the pain she feels is very realistic. She does more than act. The movie has a fast pace and with a short running time of 82 minutes there is never a dull moment. This will not be suited to the taste of many but if one has a interest in philosophy, one can't go wrong.

    Ferrara's oeuvre in general, and the praise heaped on this movie in particular, confirms for me yet again the almost boundless gullibility of even that part of the cinemagoing public that considers itself to be more "demanding" than the average multiplex customer. The qualities that Ferrara has going for him, and that he never tires of REMINDING us he has going for him - that he is a "maverick", an "independent film-maker", and that he is cinematographically competent and able to give his movies a certain visual style - would be estimable if they were combined with any intelligence or with the presence in his head of any idea really worth giving visual and narrative expression to. Unfortunately, no film that Ferrara has ever made has given any evidence of either of these. His scriptwriter on this and almost all his other movies, Nicholas St. John, has regularly provided him with material of strikingly low quality, which Ferrara himself, and the generally top-class group of actors and actresses - Walken, Keitel, Sciorra - with whom he works must then labor as best they can to rescue. Keitel's bravura performance in "Bad Lieutenant", for example, is the only reason I can think of for this film's being constantly praised as a landmark and a masterpiece. As a theological drama, it has about as much depth as "The Song of Bernadette". And "The Addiction" displays the same facile, cheap, and cynically opportunistic relation to philosophical ideas as "Bad Lieutenant" does to religious ones. Anyone who has taken even a serious amateur interest in philosophy will recognize all the "philosophical" paraphernalia of St. John's script as entirely hokey right from the opening scenes on. (It is an indication of the level of Ferrara's intellectual and moral honesty that he is on record as believing, or as pretending to believe, St. John's ridiculous story that he "studied philosophy at Heidelberg", "Heidelberg", I suppose, being the kind of place you claim to have studied philosophy at if you want to sound "really deep" (those Germans, you know)). Nobody on the set appears to have been capable of instructing Lili Taylor in how to pronounce the name "Sartre" or the actor playing her philosophy professor in how to pronounce the name "Nietzsche" and, as Jonathan Rosenbaum and other intelligent reviewers have commented, the dialogue woven around this faulty name-dropping is clearly not based on any actual reading in any of these writers but just on puerile juggling with a few images and phrases gleaned from secondary and tertiary sources (the intendedly effortlessly erudite exchanges about "anthropology" between Lili Taylor and her first student victim about the concept of "anthropology" - "Protagoras", "Feuerbach" etc. - are in fact the nonsensical result of running down a list of the historical occurrences of the term in some concise encyclopedia of philosophy). "The Addiction", in other words, is as irredeemably dumb as US movies about super-clever people - "Good Will Hunting" etc. - invariably tend to be. Ferrara, "maverick" as he is or claims to be, thinks and feels no differently about the commodity: "intelligence" than the most vulgar mainstream director. To him as to the peddler of Hollywood trash, "intelligence" is something that can be ordered up simply by slapping together whatever ingredients are recommended as being "the right stuff if you're into that sort of thing". (This betting on "heavy reps" in these matters is also the reason why US cinematic portraits of "intellectual life" tend to lag, on average, about thirty years behind the times. The very idea that Satrre and Kierkegaard should be the "burning topics" of intellectual discussion at the philosophy department of a New York university in 1995 - where any student who took him- or herself even halfway seriously would have been at grips rather with Derrida and Foucault and would have laughed at the mere mention of existentialism - betrays the "philosophy" of this movie as "philosophy for tourists". In short, an unforgivably awful movie - and another reason to shake one's head in wonder at how a relentlessly self-promoting quarter-educated New York hipster like Ferrara has succeeded in hoodwinking such a huge proportion of the cinematic establishment.

    This movie is not a vampire movie. The entire concept of vampirism in this movie is itself a metaphor for addiction (alcohol, drugs etc.). And why do I say that? Well, for one thing, it lacks many of the non-addictive parts of vampire lore. A human does not transform into a vampire by just being bitten. The very idea of that is ridiculous, since if that was the case, and just 1 person bit another per day, who then turned into a vampire, who again bit 1 person per day etc., the entire world would be populated solely by vampires in a matter of months. This movie is supposed to depict the descent into drug addiction or alcoholism. When we first encounter the addiction, it (personified by the first vampire in the movie), says "Tell me to leave. Say it as you mean it!". This is the drug/alcohol talking. But she can't. This is the ambivalence of the addicts' mind, when she knows that it is leading into descent, yet is unable to resist. After that, the urge just increases, and gets more and more evident. Finally, she goes to see a therapist - personified by another vampire, Peina. This vampire is an passive alcoholic, who has been through what Kathleen has, but now is clean. But the therapy is not helping. When she says "What do you want?", and he angrily replies, "No! What do YOU want? You came to me!", is the therapist's notion of that she is beyond reach. He then leaves her with her addiction. After that, the abuse grows more and more insane. The feasting is an indicator of a raging addiction beyond control, and it leads us to the last stage - the hospital bed. There, all hope is gone, and death wish ensues. But even there, alcohol/drug manifests itself again in form of the initial vampire, who laconically states "According to R. C. Sprouse, we are not evil because we do evil things. We do evil things, because we are evil." We are drug addicts by nature, and there is nothing we can do about it. With this ambivalent comment, we are left without knowing whether death sets in or not. The movie's title, "The Addiction", does indeed refer to exactly that, the addiction, and follows an addict from her clean stage to the last stage of substance abuse. If only viewed (or at least solely) as a vampire movie, one would not 'get' the movie's intent.

    Abel Ferrara's visually impressive take on the vampire mythos. There's no black cloaks with red velvet lining here, no fangs, and definitely no transforming into bats, instead this is comparing and contrasting vampirism with drug addiction. Indeed, it is never entirely clear whether the individuals in question are in fact vampires, or, as the title implies, addicts of some kind. Beautifully shot in black and white, this is stylish and intelligent, but certainly not for gore hounds or quick thrill seekers. Unlike Ferrara's Driller Killer, this is more cerebral than horrific and is certainly the kind of movie that even horror haters may be able to sink their fangs into. Sit back and switch your frontal lobe on.

    You know when some academic talks about a subject you are unfamiliar with and you are wondering if what he says is terribly intelligent or just terribly pretentious? This is how The Addiction felt like. As another movie I have just seen, Near Dark, it deals with vampires but makes me think of drug addiction. Christopher Walken has a small, but powerful role where he explains that as long as you follow your addiction you are nothing. One expresses oneself by resisting, not embracing their addictions. But where does simple need end and addiction start? In the end, I can only say that the film, shot in black and white and featuring lovely Lilly Allen as the main character, was dark and felt interesting, but nothing of what the characters said or did meant anything to me. Does that make sense?

To him as to the peddler of Hollywood trash, "intelligence" is something that can be ordered up simply by slapping together whatever ingredients are recommended as being "the right stuff if you're into that sort of thing". (This betting on "heavy reps" in these matters is also the reason why US cinematic portraits of "intellectual life" tend to lag, on average, about thirty years behind the times. The very idea that Satrre and Kierkegaard should be the "burning topics" of intellectual discussion at the philosophy department of a New York university in 1995 - where any student who took him- or herself even halfway seriously would have been at grips rather with Derrida and Foucault and would have laughed at the mere mention of existentialism - betrays the "philosophy" of this movie as "philosophy for tourists". In short, an unforgivably awful movie - and another reason to shake one's head in wonder at how a relentlessly self-promoting quarter-educated New York hipster like Ferrara has succeeded in hoodwinking such a huge proportion of the cinematic establishment.

    This movie is not a vampire movie. The entire concept of vampirism in this movie is itself a metaphor for addiction (alcohol, drugs etc.). And why do I say that? Well, for one thing, it lacks many of the non-addictive parts of vampire lore. A human does not transform into a vampire by just being bitten. The very idea of that is ridiculous, since if that was the case, and just 1 person bit another per day, who then turned into a vampire, who again bit 1 person per day etc., the entire world would be populated solely by vampires in a matter of months. This movie is supposed to depict the descent into drug addiction or alcoholism. When we first encounter the addiction, it (personified by the first vampire in the movie), says "Tell me to leave. Say it as you mean it!". This is the drug/alcohol talking. But she can't. This is the ambivalence of the addicts' mind, when she knows that it is leading into descent, yet is unable to resist. After that, the urge just increases, and gets more and more evident. Finally, she goes to see a therapist - personified by another vampire, Peina. This vampire is an passive alcoholic, who has been through what Kathleen has, but now is clean. But the therapy is not helping. When she says "What do you want?", and he angrily replies, "No! What do YOU want? You came to me!", is the therapist's notion of that she is beyond reach. He then leaves her with her addiction. After that, the abuse grows more and more insane. The feasting is an indicator of a raging addiction beyond control, and it leads us to the last stage - the hospital bed. There, all hope is gone, and death wish ensues. But even there, alcohol/drug manifests itself again in form of the initial vampire, who laconically states "According to R. C. Sprouse, we are not evil because we do evil things. We do evil things, because we are evil." We are drug addicts by nature, and there is nothing we can do about it. With this ambivalent comment, we are left without knowing whether death sets in or not. The movie's title, "The Addiction", does indeed refer to exactly that, the addiction, and follows an addict from her clean stage to the last stage of substance abuse. If only viewed (or at least solely) as a vampire movie, one would not 'get' the movie's intent.

    Abel Ferrara's visually impressive take on the vampire mythos. There's no black cloaks with red velvet lining here, no fangs, and definitely no transforming into bats, instead this is comparing and contrasting vampirism with drug addiction. Indeed, it is never entirely clear whether the individuals in question are in fact vampires, or, as the title implies, addicts of some kind. Beautifully shot in black and white, this is stylish and intelligent, but certainly not for gore hounds or quick thrill seekers. Unlike Ferrara's Driller Killer, this is more cerebral than horrific and is certainly the kind of movie that even horror haters may be able to sink their fangs into. Sit back and switch your frontal lobe on.

    You know when some academic talks about a subject you are unfamiliar with and you are wondering if what he says is terribly intelligent or just terribly pretentious? This is how The Addiction felt like. As another movie I have just seen, Near Dark, it deals with vampires but makes me think of drug addiction. Christopher Walken has a small, but powerful role where he explains that as long as you follow your addiction you are nothing. One expresses oneself by resisting, not embracing their addictions. But where does simple need end and addiction start? In the end, I can only say that the film, shot in black and white and featuring lovely Lilly Allen as the main character, was dark and felt interesting, but nothing of what the characters said or did meant anything to me. Does that make sense?

    This is how a vampire movie should be. It is very dark and grim and what makes it frightening is that it's realistic. Christopher Walken is great in this and the role is perfect for him. Lili Taylor is great too. But what really makes it stand out is the story as well as the cinematography. It's not really a vampire movie. It reminded me more of movies like "Requiem for a Dream". But it's not just a movie about drug abuse either, nor is it simply a philosophical movie. I must have watched this movie like 20 times (since it came out back in the day). And each time I watch it, it's interesting because I discover something new and interpret it in a new way. Nowhere in the movie does it mention that they are vampires. We just ASSUME they are vampires cause that is what we are expecting and that is how they look and behave. But then again they also look and behave like drug addicts and/or rapists. The movie starts with the question of why and how people are capable of war crimes, rape and other atrocities... and in the course of the movie you learn how and why. The ending is very interesting and had me thinking quite a bit before I figured it out. Of course I won't tell you... go watch it yourself. If you like horror movies that make you think about them and that don't need special effects to scare you, than this is well worth your time.

    I respect the user reviews here a lot. I am genuinely in the minority in not admiring this movie. I admire the work of Ferrara and many of the actors in it. However, I thought that the great Lily Taylor sounded fed-up and was simply reciting memorized pages of Philosophy for Dummies. There has to be some connection between the director and Dick Wolf or w/LAW AND ORDER FOR so many of the L&O actors to have been involved w/this project. Maybe it's D'Onofrio's connection w/Taylor and their masterwork, HOUSEHOLD SAINTS. I am pleased so many people find this an amazing work, but I just didn't get it.

    While trying to finish her thesis, a college student finds herself bitten by a vampire and tries to come to grips with the deadly affliction as she's mentored in the ways of their species and tries to avoid giving away her new identity. This one certainly has some pretty decent ways to go here, mainly through the use of the clever gimmick that gets this one over by having her compare vampirism through philosophical queries, but unfortunately that only has a two-pronged effect that doesn't do anything for the film at hand. On the one, it makes the film just incredibly boring and not really all that interesting, since she spends the majority of time simply doing nothing but complaining about the utterly useless knowledge given to her by the school and relying on other means to get through the change. Eventually, it all just comes across as pretentious nonsense that makes no sense at all and just tends to sound whatever it needed to do to agree with their principle ideas. The other factor, as mentioned before, is that not a lot happens in here and it tends to just ramble on, like she does, and nothing gets done because of that. Even the novel Black-and-White can't save this one. Rated R: Graphic Violence, Language, drug use and Brief Nudity.

    Vampires are essentially a romanticizing of abject psychopathy. They take pride in their "superiority" and, at best, feel somewhat sorry for their unfortunate but inferior prey. They just can't help themselves, of course, they are "victims of their own nature." When they observe normal, caring people with actual consciences, able to love one and other, able to sacrifice, able to believe in a higher power, they become enraged, which, to them justifies more predation. For some reason, we are attracted to sociopaths, whether it be portrayed by a politician, movie villain, serial murderer, bad boy with the tight jeans, or bad girl with the hard, gray eyes. Maybe it is their perceived power, maybe their life free from guilt, I don't know. But for whatever sociopaths (and vampires) are thick on the ground in modern movies and TV shows. I'm tired of them. This is just another movie about sociopaths, not even cute or sexy sociopaths, just sickies. Good acting (I love Walken and Taylor as actors, but despite its pretensions to philosophy, it is just another movie glorifying the coldness that resides in the hearts of some "humans".

    Abel Ferrara, the director of this art-house flick is best known for his banned movie The Driller Killer. Just before he made that he even directed a porn flick, so he surely knows what to do with a movie, another much talked about flick directed by him is Ms 45. And of course this arty flick is also much talked about. The story is so simple. Bitten unsuspectingly by a vampire and living with being a vampire. It's in black and white which of course gave it's art feeling but it is also a slow movie with some blood running now and then but it surely works due the perfect performances. The use of rap music (cypress hill) and real news footage (My Lai)also did it's work. Especially the news footage is not for the sqeaumish. It surely is worth watching, no special effects just a story being brought to you in a typical Abel way. A must see.

    From the director of 'Body Snatchers' and 'Bad Lieutenant' Abel Ferrara, comes a movie which is in the horror vein. Horror is not a theme which Ferrara is highly regarded for, however 'The addiction' rather tends to pursue giving a dictation on philosophical theories than intending to frighten the viewer. I first watched this when I was a student myself. This is one movie that can be appreciated for what exists underneath than watching people being bitten. Initially many will perceive this to be a vampire movie. But ones perception will be dependant on how he/she understands the concept. Shot in black and white, this has intended to give the movie a Gothic atmosphere. I personally felt that the black and white presentation eradicates a small proportion of the level of enjoyment that could have been experienced. SPOILERS The basic plot revolves around Lily Taylor who plays a philosophy student. On one night she is bitten by Annabelle Sciorra. From that night on the course of her life changes forever as she slowly begins to live life differently and acts in inhuman manners. She sucks blood from a few individuals and in between we hear quotes of philosophy that she narrates. In the end she attains her degree and indulges in a blood orgy at a get together party with a few of a revamped friends. I found it difficult to understand the final scene. My interpretation was quite confusing. I could not understand if Taylor was alive or dead. The movie ends on a strange piece of thought. But plot wise one should not expect much on it. END OF Spoiler This is one of Abel Ferrara's more intelligent and less appreciated movies. He had moved far away from the tacky material that he used to make in the 70s and 80s. Many may experience a unsettling feeling with the images of a graphic nature but this is part of what Taylor is studying. Lily Taylor gives a fine performance and her constant body movements expressing the pain she feels is very realistic. She does more than act. The movie has a fast pace and with a short running time of 82 minutes there is never a dull moment. This will not be suited to the taste of many but if one has a interest in philosophy, one can't go wrong.

    Ferrara's oeuvre in general, and the praise heaped on this movie in particular, confirms for me yet again the almost boundless gullibility of even that part of the cinemagoing public that considers itself to be more "demanding" than the average multiplex customer. The qualities that Ferrara has going for him, and that he never tires of REMINDING us he has going for him - that he is a "maverick", an "independent film-maker", and that he is cinematographically competent and able to give his movies a certain visual style - would be estimable if they were combined with any intelligence or with the presence in his head of any idea really worth giving visual and narrative expression to. Unfortunately, no film that Ferrara has ever made has given any evidence of either of these. His scriptwriter on this and almost all his other movies, Nicholas St. John, has regularly provided him with material of strikingly low quality, which Ferrara himself, and the generally top-class group of actors and actresses - Walken, Keitel, Sciorra - with whom he works must then labor as best they can to rescue. Keitel's bravura performance in "Bad Lieutenant", for example, is the only reason I can think of for this film's being constantly praised as a landmark and a masterpiece. As a theological drama, it has about as much depth as "The Song of Bernadette". And "The Addiction" displays the same facile, cheap, and cynically opportunistic relation to philosophical ideas as "Bad Lieutenant" does to religious ones. Anyone who has taken even a serious amateur interest in philosophy will recognize all the "philosophical" paraphernalia of St. John's script as entirely hokey right from the opening scenes on. (It is an indication of the level of Ferrara's intellectual and moral honesty that he is on record as believing, or as pretending to believe, St. John's ridiculous story that he "studied philosophy at Heidelberg", "Heidelberg", I suppose, being the kind of place you claim to have studied philosophy at if you want to sound "really deep" (those Germans, you know)). Nobody on the set appears to have been capable of instructing Lili Taylor in how to pronounce the name "Sartre" or the actor playing her philosophy professor in how to pronounce the name "Nietzsche" and, as Jonathan Rosenbaum and other intelligent reviewers have commented, the dialogue woven around this faulty name-dropping is clearly not based on any actual reading in any of these writers but just on puerile juggling with a few images and phrases gleaned from secondary and tertiary sources (the intendedly effortlessly erudite exchanges about "anthropology" between Lili Taylor and her first student victim about the concept of "anthropology" - "Protagoras", "Feuerbach" etc. - are in fact the nonsensical result of running down a list of the historical occurrences of the term in some concise encyclopedia of philosophy). "The Addiction", in other words, is as irredeemably dumb as US movies about super-clever people - "Good Will Hunting" etc. - invariably tend to be. Ferrara, "maverick" as he is or claims to be, thinks and feels no differently about the commodity: "intelligence" than the most vulgar mainstream director. To him as to the peddler of Hollywood trash, "intelligence" is something that can be ordered up simply by slapping together whatever ingredients are recommended as being "the right stuff if you're into that sort of thing". (This betting on "heavy reps" in these matters is also the reason why US cinematic portraits of "intellectual life" tend to lag, on average, about thirty years behind the times. The very idea that Satrre and Kierkegaard should be the "burning topics" of intellectual discussion at the philosophy department of a New York university in 1995 - where any student who took him- or herself even halfway seriously would have been at grips rather with Derrida and Foucault and would have laughed at the mere mention of existentialism - betrays the "philosophy" of this movie as "philosophy for tourists". In short, an unforgivably awful movie - and another reason to shake one's head in wonder at how a relentlessly self-promoting quarter-educated New York hipster like Ferrara has succeeded in hoodwinking such a huge proportion of the cinematic establishment.

In the end she attains her degree and indulges in a blood orgy at a get together party with a few of a revamped friends. I found it difficult to understand the final scene. My interpretation was quite confusing. I could not understand if Taylor was alive or dead. The movie ends on a strange piece of thought. But plot wise one should not expect much on it. END OF Spoiler This is one of Abel Ferrara's more intelligent and less appreciated movies. He had moved far away from the tacky material that he used to make in the 70s and 80s. Many may experience a unsettling feeling with the images of a graphic nature but this is part of what Taylor is studying. Lily Taylor gives a fine performance and her constant body movements expressing the pain she feels is very realistic. She does more than act. The movie has a fast pace and with a short running time of 82 minutes there is never a dull moment. This will not be suited to the taste of many but if one has a interest in philosophy, one can't go wrong.

    Ferrara's oeuvre in general, and the praise heaped on this movie in particular, confirms for me yet again the almost boundless gullibility of even that part of the cinemagoing public that considers itself to be more "demanding" than the average multiplex customer. The qualities that Ferrara has going for him, and that he never tires of REMINDING us he has going for him - that he is a "maverick", an "independent film-maker", and that he is cinematographically competent and able to give his movies a certain visual style - would be estimable if they were combined with any intelligence or with the presence in his head of any idea really worth giving visual and narrative expression to. Unfortunately, no film that Ferrara has ever made has given any evidence of either of these. His scriptwriter on this and almost all his other movies, Nicholas St. John, has regularly provided him with material of strikingly low quality, which Ferrara himself, and the generally top-class group of actors and actresses - Walken, Keitel, Sciorra - with whom he works must then labor as best they can to rescue. Keitel's bravura performance in "Bad Lieutenant", for example, is the only reason I can think of for this film's being constantly praised as a landmark and a masterpiece. As a theological drama, it has about as much depth as "The Song of Bernadette". And "The Addiction" displays the same facile, cheap, and cynically opportunistic relation to philosophical ideas as "Bad Lieutenant" does to religious ones. Anyone who has taken even a serious amateur interest in philosophy will recognize all the "philosophical" paraphernalia of St. John's script as entirely hokey right from the opening scenes on. (It is an indication of the level of Ferrara's intellectual and moral honesty that he is on record as believing, or as pretending to believe, St. John's ridiculous story that he "studied philosophy at Heidelberg", "Heidelberg", I suppose, being the kind of place you claim to have studied philosophy at if you want to sound "really deep" (those Germans, you know)). Nobody on the set appears to have been capable of instructing Lili Taylor in how to pronounce the name "Sartre" or the actor playing her philosophy professor in how to pronounce the name "Nietzsche" and, as Jonathan Rosenbaum and other intelligent reviewers have commented, the dialogue woven around this faulty name-dropping is clearly not based on any actual reading in any of these writers but just on puerile juggling with a few images and phrases gleaned from secondary and tertiary sources (the intendedly effortlessly erudite exchanges about "anthropology" between Lili Taylor and her first student victim about the concept of "anthropology" - "Protagoras", "Feuerbach" etc. - are in fact the nonsensical result of running down a list of the historical occurrences of the term in some concise encyclopedia of philosophy). "The Addiction", in other words, is as irredeemably dumb as US movies about super-clever people - "Good Will Hunting" etc. - invariably tend to be. Ferrara, "maverick" as he is or claims to be, thinks and feels no differently about the commodity: "intelligence" than the most vulgar mainstream director. To him as to the peddler of Hollywood trash, "intelligence" is something that can be ordered up simply by slapping together whatever ingredients are recommended as being "the right stuff if you're into that sort of thing". (This betting on "heavy reps" in these matters is also the reason why US cinematic portraits of "intellectual life" tend to lag, on average, about thirty years behind the times. The very idea that Satrre and Kierkegaard should be the "burning topics" of intellectual discussion at the philosophy department of a New York university in 1995 - where any student who took him- or herself even halfway seriously would have been at grips rather with Derrida and Foucault and would have laughed at the mere mention of existentialism - betrays the "philosophy" of this movie as "philosophy for tourists". In short, an unforgivably awful movie - and another reason to shake one's head in wonder at how a relentlessly self-promoting quarter-educated New York hipster like Ferrara has succeeded in hoodwinking such a huge proportion of the cinematic establishment.

    This movie is not a vampire movie. The entire concept of vampirism in this movie is itself a metaphor for addiction (alcohol, drugs etc.). And why do I say that? Well, for one thing, it lacks many of the non-addictive parts of vampire lore. A human does not transform into a vampire by just being bitten. The very idea of that is ridiculous, since if that was the case, and just 1 person bit another per day, who then turned into a vampire, who again bit 1 person per day etc., the entire world would be populated solely by vampires in a matter of months. This movie is supposed to depict the descent into drug addiction or alcoholism. When we first encounter the addiction, it (personified by the first vampire in the movie), says "Tell me to leave. Say it as you mean it!". This is the drug/alcohol talking. But she can't. This is the ambivalence of the addicts' mind, when she knows that it is leading into descent, yet is unable to resist. After that, the urge just increases, and gets more and more evident. Finally, she goes to see a therapist - personified by another vampire, Peina. This vampire is an passive alcoholic, who has been through what Kathleen has, but now is clean. But the therapy is not helping. When she says "What do you want?", and he angrily replies, "No! What do YOU want? You came to me!", is the therapist's notion of that she is beyond reach. He then leaves her with her addiction. After that, the abuse grows more and more insane. The feasting is an indicator of a raging addiction beyond control, and it leads us to the last stage - the hospital bed. There, all hope is gone, and death wish ensues. But even there, alcohol/drug manifests itself again in form of the initial vampire, who laconically states "According to R. C. Sprouse, we are not evil because we do evil things. We do evil things, because we are evil." We are drug addicts by nature, and there is nothing we can do about it. With this ambivalent comment, we are left without knowing whether death sets in or not. The movie's title, "The Addiction", does indeed refer to exactly that, the addiction, and follows an addict from her clean stage to the last stage of substance abuse. If only viewed (or at least solely) as a vampire movie, one would not 'get' the movie's intent.

    Abel Ferrara's visually impressive take on the vampire mythos. There's no black cloaks with red velvet lining here, no fangs, and definitely no transforming into bats, instead this is comparing and contrasting vampirism with drug addiction. Indeed, it is never entirely clear whether the individuals in question are in fact vampires, or, as the title implies, addicts of some kind. Beautifully shot in black and white, this is stylish and intelligent, but certainly not for gore hounds or quick thrill seekers. Unlike Ferrara's Driller Killer, this is more cerebral than horrific and is certainly the kind of movie that even horror haters may be able to sink their fangs into. Sit back and switch your frontal lobe on.

    You know when some academic talks about a subject you are unfamiliar with and you are wondering if what he says is terribly intelligent or just terribly pretentious? This is how The Addiction felt like. As another movie I have just seen, Near Dark, it deals with vampires but makes me think of drug addiction. Christopher Walken has a small, but powerful role where he explains that as long as you follow your addiction you are nothing. One expresses oneself by resisting, not embracing their addictions. But where does simple need end and addiction start? In the end, I can only say that the film, shot in black and white and featuring lovely Lilly Allen as the main character, was dark and felt interesting, but nothing of what the characters said or did meant anything to me. Does that make sense?

    This is how a vampire movie should be. It is very dark and grim and what makes it frightening is that it's realistic. Christopher Walken is great in this and the role is perfect for him. Lili Taylor is great too. But what really makes it stand out is the story as well as the cinematography. It's not really a vampire movie. It reminded me more of movies like "Requiem for a Dream". But it's not just a movie about drug abuse either, nor is it simply a philosophical movie. I must have watched this movie like 20 times (since it came out back in the day). And each time I watch it, it's interesting because I discover something new and interpret it in a new way. Nowhere in the movie does it mention that they are vampires. We just ASSUME they are vampires cause that is what we are expecting and that is how they look and behave. But then again they also look and behave like drug addicts and/or rapists. The movie starts with the question of why and how people are capable of war crimes, rape and other atrocities... and in the course of the movie you learn how and why. The ending is very interesting and had me thinking quite a bit before I figured it out. Of course I won't tell you... go watch it yourself. If you like horror movies that make you think about them and that don't need special effects to scare you, than this is well worth your time.

    I respect the user reviews here a lot. I am genuinely in the minority in not admiring this movie. I admire the work of Ferrara and many of the actors in it. However, I thought that the great Lily Taylor sounded fed-up and was simply reciting memorized pages of Philosophy for Dummies. There has to be some connection between the director and Dick Wolf or w/LAW AND ORDER FOR so many of the L&O actors to have been involved w/this project. Maybe it's D'Onofrio's connection w/Taylor and their masterwork, HOUSEHOLD SAINTS. I am pleased so many people find this an amazing work, but I just didn't get it.

    While trying to finish her thesis, a college student finds herself bitten by a vampire and tries to come to grips with the deadly affliction as she's mentored in the ways of their species and tries to avoid giving away her new identity. This one certainly has some pretty decent ways to go here, mainly through the use of the clever gimmick that gets this one over by having her compare vampirism through philosophical queries, but unfortunately that only has a two-pronged effect that doesn't do anything for the film at hand. On the one, it makes the film just incredibly boring and not really all that interesting, since she spends the majority of time simply doing nothing but complaining about the utterly useless knowledge given to her by the school and relying on other means to get through the change. Eventually, it all just comes across as pretentious nonsense that makes no sense at all and just tends to sound whatever it needed to do to agree with their principle ideas. The other factor, as mentioned before, is that not a lot happens in here and it tends to just ramble on, like she does, and nothing gets done because of that. Even the novel Black-and-White can't save this one. Rated R: Graphic Violence, Language, drug use and Brief Nudity.

    Vampires are essentially a romanticizing of abject psychopathy. They take pride in their "superiority" and, at best, feel somewhat sorry for their unfortunate but inferior prey. They just can't help themselves, of course, they are "victims of their own nature." When they observe normal, caring people with actual consciences, able to love one and other, able to sacrifice, able to believe in a higher power, they become enraged, which, to them justifies more predation. For some reason, we are attracted to sociopaths, whether it be portrayed by a politician, movie villain, serial murderer, bad boy with the tight jeans, or bad girl with the hard, gray eyes. Maybe it is their perceived power, maybe their life free from guilt, I don't know. But for whatever sociopaths (and vampires) are thick on the ground in modern movies and TV shows. I'm tired of them. This is just another movie about sociopaths, not even cute or sexy sociopaths, just sickies. Good acting (I love Walken and Taylor as actors, but despite its pretensions to philosophy, it is just another movie glorifying the coldness that resides in the hearts of some "humans".

    Abel Ferrara, the director of this art-house flick is best known for his banned movie The Driller Killer. Just before he made that he even directed a porn flick, so he surely knows what to do with a movie, another much talked about flick directed by him is Ms 45. And of course this arty flick is also much talked about. The story is so simple. Bitten unsuspectingly by a vampire and living with being a vampire. It's in black and white which of course gave it's art feeling but it is also a slow movie with some blood running now and then but it surely works due the perfect performances. The use of rap music (cypress hill) and real news footage (My Lai)also did it's work. Especially the news footage is not for the sqeaumish. It surely is worth watching, no special effects just a story being brought to you in a typical Abel way. A must see.

    From the director of 'Body Snatchers' and 'Bad Lieutenant' Abel Ferrara, comes a movie which is in the horror vein. Horror is not a theme which Ferrara is highly regarded for, however 'The addiction' rather tends to pursue giving a dictation on philosophical theories than intending to frighten the viewer. I first watched this when I was a student myself. This is one movie that can be appreciated for what exists underneath than watching people being bitten. Initially many will perceive this to be a vampire movie. But ones perception will be dependant on how he/she understands the concept. Shot in black and white, this has intended to give the movie a Gothic atmosphere. I personally felt that the black and white presentation eradicates a small proportion of the level of enjoyment that could have been experienced. SPOILERS The basic plot revolves around Lily Taylor who plays a philosophy student. On one night she is bitten by Annabelle Sciorra. From that night on the course of her life changes forever as she slowly begins to live life differently and acts in inhuman manners. She sucks blood from a few individuals and in between we hear quotes of philosophy that she narrates. In the end she attains her degree and indulges in a blood orgy at a get together party with a few of a revamped friends. I found it difficult to understand the final scene. My interpretation was quite confusing. I could not understand if Taylor was alive or dead. The movie ends on a strange piece of thought. But plot wise one should not expect much on it. END OF Spoiler This is one of Abel Ferrara's more intelligent and less appreciated movies. He had moved far away from the tacky material that he used to make in the 70s and 80s. Many may experience a unsettling feeling with the images of a graphic nature but this is part of what Taylor is studying. Lily Taylor gives a fine performance and her constant body movements expressing the pain she feels is very realistic. She does more than act. The movie has a fast pace and with a short running time of 82 minutes there is never a dull moment. This will not be suited to the taste of many but if one has a interest in philosophy, one can't go wrong.

    Vampires are essentially a romanticizing of abject psychopathy. They take pride in their "superiority" and, at best, feel somewhat sorry for their unfortunate but inferior prey. They just can't help themselves, of course, they are "victims of their own nature." When they observe normal, caring people with actual consciences, able to love one and other, able to sacrifice, able to believe in a higher power, they become enraged, which, to them justifies more predation. For some reason, we are attracted to sociopaths, whether it be portrayed by a politician, movie villain, serial murderer, bad boy with the tight jeans, or bad girl with the hard, gray eyes. Maybe it is their perceived power, maybe their life free from guilt, I don't know. But for whatever sociopaths (and vampires) are thick on the ground in modern movies and TV shows. I'm tired of them. This is just another movie about sociopaths, not even cute or sexy sociopaths, just sickies. Good acting (I love Walken and Taylor as actors, but despite its pretensions to philosophy, it is just another movie glorifying the coldness that resides in the hearts of some "humans".

    Abel Ferrara, the director of this art-house flick is best known for his banned movie The Driller Killer. Just before he made that he even directed a porn flick, so he surely knows what to do with a movie, another much talked about flick directed by him is Ms 45. And of course this arty flick is also much talked about. The story is so simple. Bitten unsuspectingly by a vampire and living with being a vampire. It's in black and white which of course gave it's art feeling but it is also a slow movie with some blood running now and then but it surely works due the perfect performances. The use of rap music (cypress hill) and real news footage (My Lai)also did it's work. Especially the news footage is not for the sqeaumish. It surely is worth watching, no special effects just a story being brought to you in a typical Abel way. A must see.

    From the director of 'Body Snatchers' and 'Bad Lieutenant' Abel Ferrara, comes a movie which is in the horror vein. Horror is not a theme which Ferrara is highly regarded for, however 'The addiction' rather tends to pursue giving a dictation on philosophical theories than intending to frighten the viewer. I first watched this when I was a student myself. This is one movie that can be appreciated for what exists underneath than watching people being bitten. Initially many will perceive this to be a vampire movie. But ones perception will be dependant on how he/she understands the concept. Shot in black and white, this has intended to give the movie a Gothic atmosphere. I personally felt that the black and white presentation eradicates a small proportion of the level of enjoyment that could have been experienced. SPOILERS The basic plot revolves around Lily Taylor who plays a philosophy student. On one night she is bitten by Annabelle Sciorra. From that night on the course of her life changes forever as she slowly begins to live life differently and acts in inhuman manners. She sucks blood from a few individuals and in between we hear quotes of philosophy that she narrates. In the end she attains her degree and indulges in a blood orgy at a get together party with a few of a revamped friends. I found it difficult to understand the final scene. My interpretation was quite confusing. I could not understand if Taylor was alive or dead. The movie ends on a strange piece of thought. But plot wise one should not expect much on it. END OF Spoiler This is one of Abel Ferrara's more intelligent and less appreciated movies. He had moved far away from the tacky material that he used to make in the 70s and 80s. Many may experience a unsettling feeling with the images of a graphic nature but this is part of what Taylor is studying. Lily Taylor gives a fine performance and her constant body movements expressing the pain she feels is very realistic. She does more than act. The movie has a fast pace and with a short running time of 82 minutes there is never a dull moment. This will not be suited to the taste of many but if one has a interest in philosophy, one can't go wrong.

    Ferrara's oeuvre in general, and the praise heaped on this movie in particular, confirms for me yet again the almost boundless gullibility of even that part of the cinemagoing public that considers itself to be more "demanding" than the average multiplex customer. The qualities that Ferrara has going for him, and that he never tires of REMINDING us he has going for him - that he is a "maverick", an "independent film-maker", and that he is cinematographically competent and able to give his movies a certain visual style - would be estimable if they were combined with any intelligence or with the presence in his head of any idea really worth giving visual and narrative expression to. Unfortunately, no film that Ferrara has ever made has given any evidence of either of these. His scriptwriter on this and almost all his other movies, Nicholas St. John, has regularly provided him with material of strikingly low quality, which Ferrara himself, and the generally top-class group of actors and actresses - Walken, Keitel, Sciorra - with whom he works must then labor as best they can to rescue. Keitel's bravura performance in "Bad Lieutenant", for example, is the only reason I can think of for this film's being constantly praised as a landmark and a masterpiece. As a theological drama, it has about as much depth as "The Song of Bernadette". And "The Addiction" displays the same facile, cheap, and cynically opportunistic relation to philosophical ideas as "Bad Lieutenant" does to religious ones. Anyone who has taken even a serious amateur interest in philosophy will recognize all the "philosophical" paraphernalia of St. John's script as entirely hokey right from the opening scenes on. (It is an indication of the level of Ferrara's intellectual and moral honesty that he is on record as believing, or as pretending to believe, St. John's ridiculous story that he "studied philosophy at Heidelberg", "Heidelberg", I suppose, being the kind of place you claim to have studied philosophy at if you want to sound "really deep" (those Germans, you know)). Nobody on the set appears to have been capable of instructing Lili Taylor in how to pronounce the name "Sartre" or the actor playing her philosophy professor in how to pronounce the name "Nietzsche" and, as Jonathan Rosenbaum and other intelligent reviewers have commented, the dialogue woven around this faulty name-dropping is clearly not based on any actual reading in any of these writers but just on puerile juggling with a few images and phrases gleaned from secondary and tertiary sources (the intendedly effortlessly erudite exchanges about "anthropology" between Lili Taylor and her first student victim about the concept of "anthropology" - "Protagoras", "Feuerbach" etc. - are in fact the nonsensical result of running down a list of the historical occurrences of the term in some concise encyclopedia of philosophy). "The Addiction", in other words, is as irredeemably dumb as US movies about super-clever people - "Good Will Hunting" etc. - invariably tend to be. Ferrara, "maverick" as he is or claims to be, thinks and feels no differently about the commodity: "intelligence" than the most vulgar mainstream director. To him as to the peddler of Hollywood trash, "intelligence" is something that can be ordered up simply by slapping together whatever ingredients are recommended as being "the right stuff if you're into that sort of thing". (This betting on "heavy reps" in these matters is also the reason why US cinematic portraits of "intellectual life" tend to lag, on average, about thirty years behind the times. The very idea that Satrre and Kierkegaard should be the "burning topics" of intellectual discussion at the philosophy department of a New York university in 1995 - where any student who took him- or herself even halfway seriously would have been at grips rather with Derrida and Foucault and would have laughed at the mere mention of existentialism - betrays the "philosophy" of this movie as "philosophy for tourists". In short, an unforgivably awful movie - and another reason to shake one's head in wonder at how a relentlessly self-promoting quarter-educated New York hipster like Ferrara has succeeded in hoodwinking such a huge proportion of the cinematic establishment.

    This movie is not a vampire movie. The entire concept of vampirism in this movie is itself a metaphor for addiction (alcohol, drugs etc.). And why do I say that? Well, for one thing, it lacks many of the non-addictive parts of vampire lore. A human does not transform into a vampire by just being bitten. The very idea of that is ridiculous, since if that was the case, and just 1 person bit another per day, who then turned into a vampire, who again bit 1 person per day etc., the entire world would be populated solely by vampires in a matter of months. This movie is supposed to depict the descent into drug addiction or alcoholism. When we first encounter the addiction, it (personified by the first vampire in the movie), says "Tell me to leave. Say it as you mean it!". This is the drug/alcohol talking. But she can't. This is the ambivalence of the addicts' mind, when she knows that it is leading into descent, yet is unable to resist. After that, the urge just increases, and gets more and more evident. Finally, she goes to see a therapist - personified by another vampire, Peina. This vampire is an passive alcoholic, who has been through what Kathleen has, but now is clean. But the therapy is not helping. When she says "What do you want?", and he angrily replies, "No! What do YOU want? You came to me!", is the therapist's notion of that she is beyond reach. He then leaves her with her addiction. After that, the abuse grows more and more insane. The feasting is an indicator of a raging addiction beyond control, and it leads us to the last stage - the hospital bed. There, all hope is gone, and death wish ensues. But even there, alcohol/drug manifests itself again in form of the initial vampire, who laconically states "According to R. C. Sprouse, we are not evil because we do evil things. We do evil things, because we are evil." We are drug addicts by nature, and there is nothing we can do about it. With this ambivalent comment, we are left without knowing whether death sets in or not. The movie's title, "The Addiction", does indeed refer to exactly that, the addiction, and follows an addict from her clean stage to the last stage of substance abuse. If only viewed (or at least solely) as a vampire movie, one would not 'get' the movie's intent.

    Abel Ferrara's visually impressive take on the vampire mythos. There's no black cloaks with red velvet lining here, no fangs, and definitely no transforming into bats, instead this is comparing and contrasting vampirism with drug addiction. Indeed, it is never entirely clear whether the individuals in question are in fact vampires, or, as the title implies, addicts of some kind. Beautifully shot in black and white, this is stylish and intelligent, but certainly not for gore hounds or quick thrill seekers. Unlike Ferrara's Driller Killer, this is more cerebral than horrific and is certainly the kind of movie that even horror haters may be able to sink their fangs into. Sit back and switch your frontal lobe on.

    You know when some academic talks about a subject you are unfamiliar with and you are wondering if what he says is terribly intelligent or just terribly pretentious? This is how The Addiction felt like. As another movie I have just seen, Near Dark, it deals with vampires but makes me think of drug addiction. Christopher Walken has a small, but powerful role where he explains that as long as you follow your addiction you are nothing. One expresses oneself by resisting, not embracing their addictions. But where does simple need end and addiction start? In the end, I can only say that the film, shot in black and white and featuring lovely Lilly Allen as the main character, was dark and felt interesting, but nothing of what the characters said or did meant anything to me. Does that make sense?

    This is how a vampire movie should be. It is very dark and grim and what makes it frightening is that it's realistic. Christopher Walken is great in this and the role is perfect for him. Lili Taylor is great too. But what really makes it stand out is the story as well as the cinematography. It's not really a vampire movie. It reminded me more of movies like "Requiem for a Dream". But it's not just a movie about drug abuse either, nor is it simply a philosophical movie. I must have watched this movie like 20 times (since it came out back in the day). And each time I watch it, it's interesting because I discover something new and interpret it in a new way. Nowhere in the movie does it mention that they are vampires. We just ASSUME they are vampires cause that is what we are expecting and that is how they look and behave. But then again they also look and behave like drug addicts and/or rapists. The movie starts with the question of why and how people are capable of war crimes, rape and other atrocities... and in the course of the movie you learn how and why. The ending is very interesting and had me thinking quite a bit before I figured it out. Of course I won't tell you... go watch it yourself. If you like horror movies that make you think about them and that don't need special effects to scare you, than this is well worth your time.

    I respect the user reviews here a lot. I am genuinely in the minority in not admiring this movie. I admire the work of Ferrara and many of the actors in it. However, I thought that the great Lily Taylor sounded fed-up and was simply reciting memorized pages of Philosophy for Dummies. There has to be some connection between the director and Dick Wolf or w/LAW AND ORDER FOR so many of the L&O actors to have been involved w/this project. Maybe it's D'Onofrio's connection w/Taylor and their masterwork, HOUSEHOLD SAINTS. I am pleased so many people find this an amazing work, but I just didn't get it.

    While trying to finish her thesis, a college student finds herself bitten by a vampire and tries to come to grips with the deadly affliction as she's mentored in the ways of their species and tries to avoid giving away her new identity. This one certainly has some pretty decent ways to go here, mainly through the use of the clever gimmick that gets this one over by having her compare vampirism through philosophical queries, but unfortunately that only has a two-pronged effect that doesn't do anything for the film at hand. On the one, it makes the film just incredibly boring and not really all that interesting, since she spends the majority of time simply doing nothing but complaining about the utterly useless knowledge given to her by the school and relying on other means to get through the change. Eventually, it all just comes across as pretentious nonsense that makes no sense at all and just tends to sound whatever it needed to do to agree with their principle ideas. The other factor, as mentioned before, is that not a lot happens in here and it tends to just ramble on, like she does, and nothing gets done because of that. Even the novel Black-and-White can't save this one. Rated R: Graphic Violence, Language, drug use and Brief Nudity.

Lili Taylor is great too. But what really makes it stand out is the story as well as the cinematography. It's not really a vampire movie. It reminded me more of movies like "Requiem for a Dream". But it's not just a movie about drug abuse either, nor is it simply a philosophical movie. I must have watched this movie like 20 times (since it came out back in the day). And each time I watch it, it's interesting because I discover something new and interpret it in a new way. Nowhere in the movie does it mention that they are vampires. We just ASSUME they are vampires cause that is what we are expecting and that is how they look and behave. But then again they also look and behave like drug addicts and/or rapists. The movie starts with the question of why and how people are capable of war crimes, rape and other atrocities... and in the course of the movie you learn how and why. The ending is very interesting and had me thinking quite a bit before I figured it out. Of course I won't tell you... go watch it yourself. If you like horror movies that make you think about them and that don't need special effects to scare you, than this is well worth your time.

    I respect the user reviews here a lot. I am genuinely in the minority in not admiring this movie. I admire the work of Ferrara and many of the actors in it. However, I thought that the great Lily Taylor sounded fed-up and was simply reciting memorized pages of Philosophy for Dummies. There has to be some connection between the director and Dick Wolf or w/LAW AND ORDER FOR so many of the L&O actors to have been involved w/this project. Maybe it's D'Onofrio's connection w/Taylor and their masterwork, HOUSEHOLD SAINTS. I am pleased so many people find this an amazing work, but I just didn't get it.

    While trying to finish her thesis, a college student finds herself bitten by a vampire and tries to come to grips with the deadly affliction as she's mentored in the ways of their species and tries to avoid giving away her new identity. This one certainly has some pretty decent ways to go here, mainly through the use of the clever gimmick that gets this one over by having her compare vampirism through philosophical queries, but unfortunately that only has a two-pronged effect that doesn't do anything for the film at hand. On the one, it makes the film just incredibly boring and not really all that interesting, since she spends the majority of time simply doing nothing but complaining about the utterly useless knowledge given to her by the school and relying on other means to get through the change. Eventually, it all just comes across as pretentious nonsense that makes no sense at all and just tends to sound whatever it needed to do to agree with their principle ideas. The other factor, as mentioned before, is that not a lot happens in here and it tends to just ramble on, like she does, and nothing gets done because of that. Even the novel Black-and-White can't save this one. Rated R: Graphic Violence, Language, drug use and Brief Nudity.

    Vampires are essentially a romanticizing of abject psychopathy. They take pride in their "superiority" and, at best, feel somewhat sorry for their unfortunate but inferior prey. They just can't help themselves, of course, they are "victims of their own nature." When they observe normal, caring people with actual consciences, able to love one and other, able to sacrifice, able to believe in a higher power, they become enraged, which, to them justifies more predation. For some reason, we are attracted to sociopaths, whether it be portrayed by a politician, movie villain, serial murderer, bad boy with the tight jeans, or bad girl with the hard, gray eyes. Maybe it is their perceived power, maybe their life free from guilt, I don't know. But for whatever sociopaths (and vampires) are thick on the ground in modern movies and TV shows. I'm tired of them. This is just another movie about sociopaths, not even cute or sexy sociopaths, just sickies. Good acting (I love Walken and Taylor as actors, but despite its pretensions to philosophy, it is just another movie glorifying the coldness that resides in the hearts of some "humans".

    Abel Ferrara, the director of this art-house flick is best known for his banned movie The Driller Killer. Just before he made that he even directed a porn flick, so he surely knows what to do with a movie, another much talked about flick directed by him is Ms 45. And of course this arty flick is also much talked about. The story is so simple. Bitten unsuspectingly by a vampire and living with being a vampire. It's in black and white which of course gave it's art feeling but it is also a slow movie with some blood running now and then but it surely works due the perfect performances. The use of rap music (cypress hill) and real news footage (My Lai)also did it's work. Especially the news footage is not for the sqeaumish. It surely is worth watching, no special effects just a story being brought to you in a typical Abel way. A must see.

    From the director of 'Body Snatchers' and 'Bad Lieutenant' Abel Ferrara, comes a movie which is in the horror vein. Horror is not a theme which Ferrara is highly regarded for, however 'The addiction' rather tends to pursue giving a dictation on philosophical theories than intending to frighten the viewer. I first watched this when I was a student myself. This is one movie that can be appreciated for what exists underneath than watching people being bitten. Initially many will perceive this to be a vampire movie. But ones perception will be dependant on how he/she understands the concept. Shot in black and white, this has intended to give the movie a Gothic atmosphere. I personally felt that the black and white presentation eradicates a small proportion of the level of enjoyment that could have been experienced. SPOILERS The basic plot revolves around Lily Taylor who plays a philosophy student. On one night she is bitten by Annabelle Sciorra. From that night on the course of her life changes forever as she slowly begins to live life differently and acts in inhuman manners. She sucks blood from a few individuals and in between we hear quotes of philosophy that she narrates. In the end she attains her degree and indulges in a blood orgy at a get together party with a few of a revamped friends. I found it difficult to understand the final scene. My interpretation was quite confusing. I could not understand if Taylor was alive or dead. The movie ends on a strange piece of thought. But plot wise one should not expect much on it. END OF Spoiler This is one of Abel Ferrara's more intelligent and less appreciated movies. He had moved far away from the tacky material that he used to make in the 70s and 80s. Many may experience a unsettling feeling with the images of a graphic nature but this is part of what Taylor is studying. Lily Taylor gives a fine performance and her constant body movements expressing the pain she feels is very realistic. She does more than act. The movie has a fast pace and with a short running time of 82 minutes there is never a dull moment. This will not be suited to the taste of many but if one has a interest in philosophy, one can't go wrong.

    Ferrara's oeuvre in general, and the praise heaped on this movie in particular, confirms for me yet again the almost boundless gullibility of even that part of the cinemagoing public that considers itself to be more "demanding" than the average multiplex customer. The qualities that Ferrara has going for him, and that he never tires of REMINDING us he has going for him - that he is a "maverick", an "independent film-maker", and that he is cinematographically competent and able to give his movies a certain visual style - would be estimable if they were combined with any intelligence or with the presence in his head of any idea really worth giving visual and narrative expression to. Unfortunately, no film that Ferrara has ever made has given any evidence of either of these. His scriptwriter on this and almost all his other movies, Nicholas St. John, has regularly provided him with material of strikingly low quality, which Ferrara himself, and the generally top-class group of actors and actresses - Walken, Keitel, Sciorra - with whom he works must then labor as best they can to rescue. Keitel's bravura performance in "Bad Lieutenant", for example, is the only reason I can think of for this film's being constantly praised as a landmark and a masterpiece. As a theological drama, it has about as much depth as "The Song of Bernadette". And "The Addiction" displays the same facile, cheap, and cynically opportunistic relation to philosophical ideas as "Bad Lieutenant" does to religious ones. Anyone who has taken even a serious amateur interest in philosophy will recognize all the "philosophical" paraphernalia of St. John's script as entirely hokey right from the opening scenes on. (It is an indication of the level of Ferrara's intellectual and moral honesty that he is on record as believing, or as pretending to believe, St. John's ridiculous story that he "studied philosophy at Heidelberg", "Heidelberg", I suppose, being the kind of place you claim to have studied philosophy at if you want to sound "really deep" (those Germans, you know)). Nobody on the set appears to have been capable of instructing Lili Taylor in how to pronounce the name "Sartre" or the actor playing her philosophy professor in how to pronounce the name "Nietzsche" and, as Jonathan Rosenbaum and other intelligent reviewers have commented, the dialogue woven around this faulty name-dropping is clearly not based on any actual reading in any of these writers but just on puerile juggling with a few images and phrases gleaned from secondary and tertiary sources (the intendedly effortlessly erudite exchanges about "anthropology" between Lili Taylor and her first student victim about the concept of "anthropology" - "Protagoras", "Feuerbach" etc. - are in fact the nonsensical result of running down a list of the historical occurrences of the term in some concise encyclopedia of philosophy). "The Addiction", in other words, is as irredeemably dumb as US movies about super-clever people - "Good Will Hunting" etc. - invariably tend to be. Ferrara, "maverick" as he is or claims to be, thinks and feels no differently about the commodity: "intelligence" than the most vulgar mainstream director. To him as to the peddler of Hollywood trash, "intelligence" is something that can be ordered up simply by slapping together whatever ingredients are recommended as being "the right stuff if you're into that sort of thing". (This betting on "heavy reps" in these matters is also the reason why US cinematic portraits of "intellectual life" tend to lag, on average, about thirty years behind the times. The very idea that Satrre and Kierkegaard should be the "burning topics" of intellectual discussion at the philosophy department of a New York university in 1995 - where any student who took him- or herself even halfway seriously would have been at grips rather with Derrida and Foucault and would have laughed at the mere mention of existentialism - betrays the "philosophy" of this movie as "philosophy for tourists". In short, an unforgivably awful movie - and another reason to shake one's head in wonder at how a relentlessly self-promoting quarter-educated New York hipster like Ferrara has succeeded in hoodwinking such a huge proportion of the cinematic establishment.

    This movie is not a vampire movie. The entire concept of vampirism in this movie is itself a metaphor for addiction (alcohol, drugs etc.). And why do I say that? Well, for one thing, it lacks many of the non-addictive parts of vampire lore. A human does not transform into a vampire by just being bitten. The very idea of that is ridiculous, since if that was the case, and just 1 person bit another per day, who then turned into a vampire, who again bit 1 person per day etc., the entire world would be populated solely by vampires in a matter of months. This movie is supposed to depict the descent into drug addiction or alcoholism. When we first encounter the addiction, it (personified by the first vampire in the movie), says "Tell me to leave. Say it as you mean it!". This is the drug/alcohol talking. But she can't. This is the ambivalence of the addicts' mind, when she knows that it is leading into descent, yet is unable to resist. After that, the urge just increases, and gets more and more evident. Finally, she goes to see a therapist - personified by another vampire, Peina. This vampire is an passive alcoholic, who has been through what Kathleen has, but now is clean. But the therapy is not helping. When she says "What do you want?", and he angrily replies, "No! What do YOU want? You came to me!", is the therapist's notion of that she is beyond reach. He then leaves her with her addiction. After that, the abuse grows more and more insane. The feasting is an indicator of a raging addiction beyond control, and it leads us to the last stage - the hospital bed. There, all hope is gone, and death wish ensues. But even there, alcohol/drug manifests itself again in form of the initial vampire, who laconically states "According to R. C. Sprouse, we are not evil because we do evil things. We do evil things, because we are evil." We are drug addicts by nature, and there is nothing we can do about it. With this ambivalent comment, we are left without knowing whether death sets in or not. The movie's title, "The Addiction", does indeed refer to exactly that, the addiction, and follows an addict from her clean stage to the last stage of substance abuse. If only viewed (or at least solely) as a vampire movie, one would not 'get' the movie's intent.

    Abel Ferrara's visually impressive take on the vampire mythos. There's no black cloaks with red velvet lining here, no fangs, and definitely no transforming into bats, instead this is comparing and contrasting vampirism with drug addiction. Indeed, it is never entirely clear whether the individuals in question are in fact vampires, or, as the title implies, addicts of some kind. Beautifully shot in black and white, this is stylish and intelligent, but certainly not for gore hounds or quick thrill seekers. Unlike Ferrara's Driller Killer, this is more cerebral than horrific and is certainly the kind of movie that even horror haters may be able to sink their fangs into. Sit back and switch your frontal lobe on.

    You know when some academic talks about a subject you are unfamiliar with and you are wondering if what he says is terribly intelligent or just terribly pretentious? This is how The Addiction felt like. As another movie I have just seen, Near Dark, it deals with vampires but makes me think of drug addiction. Christopher Walken has a small, but powerful role where he explains that as long as you follow your addiction you are nothing. One expresses oneself by resisting, not embracing their addictions. But where does simple need end and addiction start? In the end, I can only say that the film, shot in black and white and featuring lovely Lilly Allen as the main character, was dark and felt interesting, but nothing of what the characters said or did meant anything to me. Does that make sense?
