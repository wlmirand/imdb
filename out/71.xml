 <sinopse>
  Tricked into thinking he killed his father, a guilt ridden lion cub flees into exile and abandons his identity as the future King.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  A lion prince, Simba, is born in Africa and the animals of the Pride Lands pay tribute. Later Simba is told by his father, King Mufasa, that when Mufasa dies, Simba will become King of the Pride Lands. Simba's Uncle Scar would have been king after Mufasa had Mufasa not had a child. Fuelled by rage, Scar plots to kill Mufasa and Simba so he is able to take over the throne. He uses the hyenas to cause a stampede through the canyon where Mufasa and Simba are, and personally ensures Mufasa falls to his death. Simba survives so Scar implies that the stampede was Simba's fault and that the pride will blame him. Simba flees the Pride Lands meaning never to return home. Simba is found, collapsed with exhaustion, by Timon the Meerkat, and Pumbaa the Warthog, and the trio become fast friends. Simba stays with them well into adulthood until his childhood friend, Nala, hunting beyond the Pride Lands that herds had deserted under Scar's mismanagement stumbles upon Simba's new home. Astonished to ...

    This is my favourite animated Disney movie ever. It has a good plot, good storyline, good characters and good villains. This movie is a must see for any kid and I'm sure a lot of adults enjoy this movie too. Basically its about a lion cub simba who is future king of the pride lands but his uncle scar wants to be king and so forms a plot to kill simba he doesn't succeed in killing simba but instead kills simbas father. Scar convinces simba that it is his fault his father died to simba feeling upset and guilty runs away. Some scenes are funny and some are sad. This is a movie I could watch over and over simply because its a great movie as I have already said a must see for anyone especially Disney fans. I give this movie an 8 out of 10

    A young lion cub named Simba is born, knowing that he will be the future king of the jungle. But after he is tricked into thinking that he killed his own father, the young cub runs away and goes into exile. When he grows older, he is forced to come back. It's pretty much common knowledge that Lion King is one of the best movies Disney has ever made. It embodies everything that makes Disney so great Â– excellent story, great characters, strong soundtrack, and a very capable cast of actors lending their voices. For me, the story is the best thing. Hamlet is one of my favourite Shakespeare plays, and the writers have done a great job of transferring that to the animal kingdom. The scene between Simba and the ghost of Mufasa, in particular, is very emotional and tugs at the heart-strings. I'm surprised that the film was as short as it was, to be honest, I think it could have been fleshed out a little more. But what we do get is great. Simba also probably ranks up there as one of Disney's greatest creations. It is a brilliantly-crafted character, very well-voiced by Matthew Broderick. As a kid, I remember how beloved Timon and Pumbaa were, but I didn't really see the appeal. Mufasa (James Earl Jones) and Scar (Jeremy Irons) are also very good. Coincidentally, 'The Lion King' marks the first time a major Disney character dies, which once again re-establishes the strength of the story. My only gripe with this movie is probably just the length. A little more time and the film could have been even better. But between the emotion, the brilliant songs ('Circle Of Life' is my personal favourite) and the fun characters, you have a classic. Not just a Disney classic, but a cinema classic. I'll stop masturbating now.

    That was the first movie I've ever watched in a cinema. I was a kid and I remember crying while watching - I was in love with the characters and I was feeling them. They felt so real to me. Now... actually, as a grown person, now is the same. Characters are so believable and so realistic. Watching the movie as an adult brings a whole new meaning. The good and the bad characters from the movie are like the people I meet everyday in real life. The story is full of morals which I think are really important for young kids these days. I think that The Lion King is a must for every child and adult! With it's characters and plot, it can really move you and the kids might actually learn something from it. It is far better than modern cartoons full of meaningless action and dialogue.

    I am generally not into animated films too much, although I have seen quite a few of them down the years. Yet, there are a few that have generated into classics. The Lion King is undoubtedly one of these . This is a truly wonderful production that combines all Disney's best assets together. Firstly, the animation In 'the lion king' is way ahead of its time. Created way back in 1994, the movie contains richly drawn animations that reveal genuine feeling and I think this really helps you relate to the characters on a personal level. The music is excellent, although I suppose you wouldn't expect anything less from the legendary Hans Zimmer. Yet the story itself is surprisingly powerful for an animation and is deep in emotional resonance. Yet it is humorous at the same time which is truly a winning combination to master. I believe that 'The Lion King' is in short, the best animated feature of all time. With groundbreaking animation and voice acting as well as a memorable array of characters , this is a movie to be enjoyed worldwide by both the young and old (and inbetween).

    You may think that lion kind is just a movie for kids,but i think that the ideas in this movie created a flame inside every kid (i was a kid when i watched it).This flame is the desire for power.And it teaches us how powerful people should be.In addition it shows kids that life was never ideal and will never be.Simba was so young when his father was killed and he felt guilty about it,He went far from his place carrying that guilt. he wanted to drop that load so he lived with Timon and Bumba a silly easy life.But the king inside him woke up when his family needed him.IT made me feel that inside every person there is a KING,and it made me to work hard to search for that king inside me. Although scar was a king but the bad spirit inside him,made everything be so miserable. Everyone must watch this movie,it is the type of movies that kids must watch in order to know and understand more about life.Really it summarizes too much things like power,dreams,dealing with obstacles,love... It is really a school...

    A fantastic movie, everything is excellent, the characters, the idea, the drawings, the scenes, everything in this movie is fantastic. Even now that we have the lucky to see cartoons almost real and in 3D, this movie by itself can survive even when it was made almost 20 years ago. I can see this movie as many times as I want and I never will be bored by watching it, by son liked it, and I am sure my grandsons will loved it too, If you haven't watched this movie, you MUST watch it. FANTASTIC! If I could I would rate it as 11 instead of 10.

    This is a powerful and beautiful story, it was actually the first movie to make me cry as a kid. Not to mention it is also very fun and can be light and has a great comical aspect as well. You really do fall in love with the characters and their stories. The music composition is also awesome. They have a lot of great fun songs that are catchy and get stuck in your head even years later trust me. Elton John also composed some awesome original music for the film so it also has a romantic and love context within the film as well. It is a great film to say the least and the story is very powerful making it a must watch for kids and adults.

    This is the favorite Disney movie for a lot of people, and I'd be lying if I said it wasn't my favorite Disney animated movie as well. I FREAKIN' LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! CAN YOU SPELL AWESOME?!? This movie is incredible! It's amazing how it touches all generations of people (not just kids) who see it! Young Simba is a lion cub growing up in Eastern Africa (that's where the Swahili language is spoken) as his father, King Mufasa, shows him the way of being king. Mufasa's brother, Scar, is angry, however, because he wanted to be king and will now never get that chance. That is, unless he kills his brother and nephew. After a climactic scene in which Mufasa is thrown off a cliff into a stampede of wilder beasts, Simba believes he is responsible for the death of his father and runs away from home. While gone, he meets two colorful characters, Timon and Pumbaa, who teach him to forget about his worries and strife (not the Bare Necessities, but Hakuna Matata). But this gets compromised when his childhood friend, Nala, comes telling him the horrific events of Scar's leadership over the kingdom. He can either continue living Hakuna Matata, or go back home and own up to his responsibilities. For as great as this movie is, I'd be lying if I said there weren't problems I had with it. Number one, why didn't Scar just kill Simba instead of convincing him to run away? I thought it was because he didn't want Simba's blood on his hands, but that can't be true because he already has Mufasa'a blood on his hands. Number two, Scar could have easily have been Disney's finest villain ever! He's smart, classy, and had the guts to kill his own brother and nephew for the sake of power! He even has a Nazi troupe of hyenas following him! But in the second half of the movie, he doesn't do anything with his power. He just sits around, soaking up the fact that he's king. LAME! Number three, I don't believe Simba and Nala are in love during the "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" scene. Look at how other Disney characters fall in love, and compare it to these 2 characters. Do you honestly buy that they're in love? I think they just wanted each other's bodies, and they fell in love later and had Kiara at the end of the movie. It's interesting to me that while people always find flaws with this movie, this movie in many cases is still preferred over "Beauty and the Beast," which many claim is a perfect movie. Why is that? I think it's due to the fact that "The Lion King" is more fun and more epic. First of all, this movie is massively epic - it's one of my favorite elements about this film! It's amazing how EVERYTHING is so epic here! "Beauty and the Beast" was epic, too, but not NEARLY as epic as this film! You here it in the music, you see it in the characters, you hear it in the lines, you see it in the backgrounds - YOU SEE IT IN THE FREAKIN' OPENING!!! This is an epic film! Secondly, it's a bit more fun than "Beauty and the Beast." We can have fun with songs like "Be Our Guest" or with characters like Lumiere and Cogsworth, and there are some bright colors as well. But I feel a larger sense of fun in this movie. More characters are allowed to have fun, we see brighter colors and patterns, and there are 2 or 3 fun songs in this film. I also love the music in this film; not just the songs (I LOVE THESE SONGS!!), but also the score of the movie! If the score of this film were a woman, I'd marry her! It's beautiful, and it adds to the epicness of this movie. I love the story. People say this is based on Shakespeare's "Hamlet," but that's technically not true. The makers of this film were developing an epic story, and along the way they realized that there were connections between this and "Hamlet." It wasn't intentional at first, but it became that way later. Plus, there are elements of other epic stories in this film too, like Moses who ran away from home and came back after realizing what he needed to do for his people. But it's awesome, and I love it! I love these characters, all of them! My favorite characters are Mufasa and Rafiki. Mufasa wreaks of power! The reason we hate Scar so much is because he kills Mufasa, who we love so much! He is the father of Disney movie fathers - Disney fathers period! He says one of my favorite lines: "Look inside yourself, Simba. You are more than what you have become." OOOH, that line just OOZES power - just BLEEDS power!!! Rafiki is awesome because he is both funny and wise. He knows just what to say and just what to do for the right moment. He has funny lines like "It means you are a baboon, and I am not!" Yet he knows when to hit Simba over the head with a stick and tell him to learn from his mistakes. Go Rafiki! "The Lion King" may not be a perfect movie, but it is massive and epic enough to be able to touch so many people all over the world. Since its release almost 20 years ago, almost every child has seen it. It's reached not just most children in the world since 1994, but many adults as well. So many people have been impacted by this film, and you can see why. For the few of you who haven't seen it yet, check it out. BOOYIKA!

    Just watched this movie, and I can't believe how good it was. At first when I saw the music and all the poetry i sad "man, this won't be good". How wrong was I. This movie is a story of Simba's character, and the way he became a full grown man although in the beginning He was just a naughty little lion. And the great thing about this movie is that you can learn so much from it, about family relationships and how to find your way in the society. Great movie again... fun to watch especially when Timon & Pumba showed up. Maybe the film was a little bit short, just an hour and a half but overall great movie. 10/10!

    Out of all the animated features that the Walt Disney Company has produced, the film that seems to be the most celebrated nowadays is coincidentally the one that made the most money. That film being their 32nd full-length animated feature, The Lion King (1994). Now the question that I'm sure almost everybody is going to want me to answer is this. Do I think that the hype surrounding this film is well deserved? While I can certainly say that The Lion King is still a good movie, I honestly think that there are better Disney films out there than this one. I know I'm shocking most of America with the comment I just made, so why do I think that The Lion King is not the best Disney picture like everyone else seems to think that it is? We'll delve deeper into that later, but first, let's look at the main plot. Mufasa (James Earl Jones), the ruler of all animals in Africa, and his wife Sarabi have given birth to a young lion cub named Simba. His birth is celebrated of course with him being presented to the other animals of the kingdom by a loyal baboon. Mufasa's brother Scar (Jeremy Irons) is jealous that Simba will succeed Mufasa as king and hatches a plan with the hyenas to kill them off and take the throne for himself. After Mufasa is killed in a stampede, Scar places the blame on Simba for his father's death and orders him to get out of the kingdom forever. Simba almost dies trying to evade his home, but is saved by a meerkat named Timon and a warthog named Pumbaa. Timon and Pumbaa believe that it's okay to stay away from your troubles, and Simba decides to adapt to their laid-back way of life and never go back home. But then, his childhood friend Nala finds Simba and tells him that things are bad back at home with Scar and his hyenas taking over the land and they need him to return and know that he's alive. Given that he thought that he killed his own father, Simba must decide whether or not to challenge his uncle for the throne. I think the lesson one is supposed to obtain from this story is to learn from your past mistakes. This is also where one of the main problems of the movie resides since this particular message wasn't well delivered. Doug Walker, a popular Internet video film critic, made a good point when he said that this film didn't teach him to learn from past mistakes, but to tell people that he didn't do any mistakes. For that matter, I thought the climax really was the weakest part of the film. Between how unnecessarily confusing the content of the dialogue between Scar and Simba is, the distractingly silly moments with the comic relief and the underlying pop culture references ("They call me Mr. Pig!"), and the battle between Simba and Scar in slow motion, the climax does kind of fall flat in contrast with the earlier parts of the film. Another big issue I have with The Lion King is that I felt it didn't explain enough regarding why the hyenas are bad news to the kingdom. Sure, the movie tells us that they wipe the land clean of its grass, water, animals and other resources under the rule of Scar. However, we are given no explanations regarding why the hyenas are such bad creatures as the lions are claiming that they are. For that matter, the film also didn't tell us what made Mufasa and Scar rivals to begin with. I know it's nitpicking, but when a film lacks crucial story details like that, I can't help but penalize it for forgetting to explain more. The animation in The Lion King is spectacular, no doubt about it. Everyone's gone on about how the stampede sequence in particular is outstanding to watch on the big screen and their praise is certainly understandable. The Lion King is a visually impressive film to watch mainly because of the epic scale and depth of the African environments. With the exception of "I Just Can't Wait to Be King" which is a major distraction to the film's tone, the songs by Elton John and Tim Rice are pretty solid. "Circle of Life" is the standout song in my opinion and serves as a worthy introduction to a film of this grandness and spectacle. Hans Zimmer's orchestral score is another big standout for me in regards to the film's music, since it serves as a fitting contrast to the large and absorbing images being shown on screen. The voice-over work that stood out the most from the all-star vocal cast was James Earl Jones and Jeremy Irons. James Earl Jones incorporates the right amount of authority, humbleness, and class into his performance as Simba's dad Mufasa as we should expect for a role such as this from such a distinguished actor. Even though he's only present for half the length of the film, I thought Mufasa was one cool father figure. He felt like a real dad in both his playfulness with Simba as well as his seriousness with him about how he isn't as fearless as Simba thinks he is. There's a scene between Simba and Mufasa in which he basically states this which is very well handled and very well done. Very little else can be said about The Lion King that everyone else hasn't already said except that there's a reason why The Lion King is an animated feature that pleases almost everybody. It has comedy, drama, music, and a little bit of something for everybody. As long as movies are a form of entertainment that unifies us all, then a film with something for all of us isn't anything to complain about, is it?

    This is a powerful and beautiful story, it was actually the first movie to make me cry as a kid. Not to mention it is also very fun and can be light and has a great comical aspect as well. You really do fall in love with the characters and their stories. The music composition is also awesome. They have a lot of great fun songs that are catchy and get stuck in your head even years later trust me. Elton John also composed some awesome original music for the film so it also has a romantic and love context within the film as well. It is a great film to say the least and the story is very powerful making it a must watch for kids and adults.

    This is the favorite Disney movie for a lot of people, and I'd be lying if I said it wasn't my favorite Disney animated movie as well. I FREAKIN' LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! CAN YOU SPELL AWESOME?!? This movie is incredible! It's amazing how it touches all generations of people (not just kids) who see it! Young Simba is a lion cub growing up in Eastern Africa (that's where the Swahili language is spoken) as his father, King Mufasa, shows him the way of being king. Mufasa's brother, Scar, is angry, however, because he wanted to be king and will now never get that chance. That is, unless he kills his brother and nephew. After a climactic scene in which Mufasa is thrown off a cliff into a stampede of wilder beasts, Simba believes he is responsible for the death of his father and runs away from home. While gone, he meets two colorful characters, Timon and Pumbaa, who teach him to forget about his worries and strife (not the Bare Necessities, but Hakuna Matata). But this gets compromised when his childhood friend, Nala, comes telling him the horrific events of Scar's leadership over the kingdom. He can either continue living Hakuna Matata, or go back home and own up to his responsibilities. For as great as this movie is, I'd be lying if I said there weren't problems I had with it. Number one, why didn't Scar just kill Simba instead of convincing him to run away? I thought it was because he didn't want Simba's blood on his hands, but that can't be true because he already has Mufasa'a blood on his hands. Number two, Scar could have easily have been Disney's finest villain ever! He's smart, classy, and had the guts to kill his own brother and nephew for the sake of power! He even has a Nazi troupe of hyenas following him! But in the second half of the movie, he doesn't do anything with his power. He just sits around, soaking up the fact that he's king. LAME! Number three, I don't believe Simba and Nala are in love during the "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" scene. Look at how other Disney characters fall in love, and compare it to these 2 characters. Do you honestly buy that they're in love? I think they just wanted each other's bodies, and they fell in love later and had Kiara at the end of the movie. It's interesting to me that while people always find flaws with this movie, this movie in many cases is still preferred over "Beauty and the Beast," which many claim is a perfect movie. Why is that? I think it's due to the fact that "The Lion King" is more fun and more epic. First of all, this movie is massively epic - it's one of my favorite elements about this film! It's amazing how EVERYTHING is so epic here! "Beauty and the Beast" was epic, too, but not NEARLY as epic as this film! You here it in the music, you see it in the characters, you hear it in the lines, you see it in the backgrounds - YOU SEE IT IN THE FREAKIN' OPENING!!! This is an epic film! Secondly, it's a bit more fun than "Beauty and the Beast." We can have fun with songs like "Be Our Guest" or with characters like Lumiere and Cogsworth, and there are some bright colors as well. But I feel a larger sense of fun in this movie. More characters are allowed to have fun, we see brighter colors and patterns, and there are 2 or 3 fun songs in this film. I also love the music in this film; not just the songs (I LOVE THESE SONGS!!), but also the score of the movie! If the score of this film were a woman, I'd marry her! It's beautiful, and it adds to the epicness of this movie. I love the story. People say this is based on Shakespeare's "Hamlet," but that's technically not true. The makers of this film were developing an epic story, and along the way they realized that there were connections between this and "Hamlet." It wasn't intentional at first, but it became that way later. Plus, there are elements of other epic stories in this film too, like Moses who ran away from home and came back after realizing what he needed to do for his people. But it's awesome, and I love it! I love these characters, all of them! My favorite characters are Mufasa and Rafiki. Mufasa wreaks of power! The reason we hate Scar so much is because he kills Mufasa, who we love so much! He is the father of Disney movie fathers - Disney fathers period! He says one of my favorite lines: "Look inside yourself, Simba. You are more than what you have become." OOOH, that line just OOZES power - just BLEEDS power!!! Rafiki is awesome because he is both funny and wise. He knows just what to say and just what to do for the right moment. He has funny lines like "It means you are a baboon, and I am not!" Yet he knows when to hit Simba over the head with a stick and tell him to learn from his mistakes. Go Rafiki! "The Lion King" may not be a perfect movie, but it is massive and epic enough to be able to touch so many people all over the world. Since its release almost 20 years ago, almost every child has seen it. It's reached not just most children in the world since 1994, but many adults as well. So many people have been impacted by this film, and you can see why. For the few of you who haven't seen it yet, check it out. BOOYIKA!

    Just watched this movie, and I can't believe how good it was. At first when I saw the music and all the poetry i sad "man, this won't be good". How wrong was I. This movie is a story of Simba's character, and the way he became a full grown man although in the beginning He was just a naughty little lion. And the great thing about this movie is that you can learn so much from it, about family relationships and how to find your way in the society. Great movie again... fun to watch especially when Timon & Pumba showed up. Maybe the film was a little bit short, just an hour and a half but overall great movie. 10/10!

    Out of all the animated features that the Walt Disney Company has produced, the film that seems to be the most celebrated nowadays is coincidentally the one that made the most money. That film being their 32nd full-length animated feature, The Lion King (1994). Now the question that I'm sure almost everybody is going to want me to answer is this. Do I think that the hype surrounding this film is well deserved? While I can certainly say that The Lion King is still a good movie, I honestly think that there are better Disney films out there than this one. I know I'm shocking most of America with the comment I just made, so why do I think that The Lion King is not the best Disney picture like everyone else seems to think that it is? We'll delve deeper into that later, but first, let's look at the main plot. Mufasa (James Earl Jones), the ruler of all animals in Africa, and his wife Sarabi have given birth to a young lion cub named Simba. His birth is celebrated of course with him being presented to the other animals of the kingdom by a loyal baboon. Mufasa's brother Scar (Jeremy Irons) is jealous that Simba will succeed Mufasa as king and hatches a plan with the hyenas to kill them off and take the throne for himself. After Mufasa is killed in a stampede, Scar places the blame on Simba for his father's death and orders him to get out of the kingdom forever. Simba almost dies trying to evade his home, but is saved by a meerkat named Timon and a warthog named Pumbaa. Timon and Pumbaa believe that it's okay to stay away from your troubles, and Simba decides to adapt to their laid-back way of life and never go back home. But then, his childhood friend Nala finds Simba and tells him that things are bad back at home with Scar and his hyenas taking over the land and they need him to return and know that he's alive. Given that he thought that he killed his own father, Simba must decide whether or not to challenge his uncle for the throne. I think the lesson one is supposed to obtain from this story is to learn from your past mistakes. This is also where one of the main problems of the movie resides since this particular message wasn't well delivered. Doug Walker, a popular Internet video film critic, made a good point when he said that this film didn't teach him to learn from past mistakes, but to tell people that he didn't do any mistakes. For that matter, I thought the climax really was the weakest part of the film. Between how unnecessarily confusing the content of the dialogue between Scar and Simba is, the distractingly silly moments with the comic relief and the underlying pop culture references ("They call me Mr. Pig!"), and the battle between Simba and Scar in slow motion, the climax does kind of fall flat in contrast with the earlier parts of the film. Another big issue I have with The Lion King is that I felt it didn't explain enough regarding why the hyenas are bad news to the kingdom. Sure, the movie tells us that they wipe the land clean of its grass, water, animals and other resources under the rule of Scar. However, we are given no explanations regarding why the hyenas are such bad creatures as the lions are claiming that they are. For that matter, the film also didn't tell us what made Mufasa and Scar rivals to begin with. I know it's nitpicking, but when a film lacks crucial story details like that, I can't help but penalize it for forgetting to explain more. The animation in The Lion King is spectacular, no doubt about it. Everyone's gone on about how the stampede sequence in particular is outstanding to watch on the big screen and their praise is certainly understandable. The Lion King is a visually impressive film to watch mainly because of the epic scale and depth of the African environments. With the exception of "I Just Can't Wait to Be King" which is a major distraction to the film's tone, the songs by Elton John and Tim Rice are pretty solid. "Circle of Life" is the standout song in my opinion and serves as a worthy introduction to a film of this grandness and spectacle. Hans Zimmer's orchestral score is another big standout for me in regards to the film's music, since it serves as a fitting contrast to the large and absorbing images being shown on screen. The voice-over work that stood out the most from the all-star vocal cast was James Earl Jones and Jeremy Irons. James Earl Jones incorporates the right amount of authority, humbleness, and class into his performance as Simba's dad Mufasa as we should expect for a role such as this from such a distinguished actor. Even though he's only present for half the length of the film, I thought Mufasa was one cool father figure. He felt like a real dad in both his playfulness with Simba as well as his seriousness with him about how he isn't as fearless as Simba thinks he is. There's a scene between Simba and Mufasa in which he basically states this which is very well handled and very well done. Very little else can be said about The Lion King that everyone else hasn't already said except that there's a reason why The Lion King is an animated feature that pleases almost everybody. It has comedy, drama, music, and a little bit of something for everybody. As long as movies are a form of entertainment that unifies us all, then a film with something for all of us isn't anything to complain about, is it?

    This is my favourite animated Disney movie ever. It has a good plot, good storyline, good characters and good villains. This movie is a must see for any kid and I'm sure a lot of adults enjoy this movie too. Basically its about a lion cub simba who is future king of the pride lands but his uncle scar wants to be king and so forms a plot to kill simba he doesn't succeed in killing simba but instead kills simbas father. Scar convinces simba that it is his fault his father died to simba feeling upset and guilty runs away. Some scenes are funny and some are sad. This is a movie I could watch over and over simply because its a great movie as I have already said a must see for anyone especially Disney fans. I give this movie an 8 out of 10

    A young lion cub named Simba is born, knowing that he will be the future king of the jungle. But after he is tricked into thinking that he killed his own father, the young cub runs away and goes into exile. When he grows older, he is forced to come back. It's pretty much common knowledge that Lion King is one of the best movies Disney has ever made. It embodies everything that makes Disney so great Â– excellent story, great characters, strong soundtrack, and a very capable cast of actors lending their voices. For me, the story is the best thing. Hamlet is one of my favourite Shakespeare plays, and the writers have done a great job of transferring that to the animal kingdom. The scene between Simba and the ghost of Mufasa, in particular, is very emotional and tugs at the heart-strings. I'm surprised that the film was as short as it was, to be honest, I think it could have been fleshed out a little more. But what we do get is great. Simba also probably ranks up there as one of Disney's greatest creations. It is a brilliantly-crafted character, very well-voiced by Matthew Broderick. As a kid, I remember how beloved Timon and Pumbaa were, but I didn't really see the appeal. Mufasa (James Earl Jones) and Scar (Jeremy Irons) are also very good. Coincidentally, 'The Lion King' marks the first time a major Disney character dies, which once again re-establishes the strength of the story. My only gripe with this movie is probably just the length. A little more time and the film could have been even better. But between the emotion, the brilliant songs ('Circle Of Life' is my personal favourite) and the fun characters, you have a classic. Not just a Disney classic, but a cinema classic. I'll stop masturbating now.

    That was the first movie I've ever watched in a cinema. I was a kid and I remember crying while watching - I was in love with the characters and I was feeling them. They felt so real to me. Now... actually, as a grown person, now is the same. Characters are so believable and so realistic. Watching the movie as an adult brings a whole new meaning. The good and the bad characters from the movie are like the people I meet everyday in real life. The story is full of morals which I think are really important for young kids these days. I think that The Lion King is a must for every child and adult! With it's characters and plot, it can really move you and the kids might actually learn something from it. It is far better than modern cartoons full of meaningless action and dialogue.

    I am generally not into animated films too much, although I have seen quite a few of them down the years. Yet, there are a few that have generated into classics. The Lion King is undoubtedly one of these . This is a truly wonderful production that combines all Disney's best assets together. Firstly, the animation In 'the lion king' is way ahead of its time. Created way back in 1994, the movie contains richly drawn animations that reveal genuine feeling and I think this really helps you relate to the characters on a personal level. The music is excellent, although I suppose you wouldn't expect anything less from the legendary Hans Zimmer. Yet the story itself is surprisingly powerful for an animation and is deep in emotional resonance. Yet it is humorous at the same time which is truly a winning combination to master. I believe that 'The Lion King' is in short, the best animated feature of all time. With groundbreaking animation and voice acting as well as a memorable array of characters , this is a movie to be enjoyed worldwide by both the young and old (and inbetween).

    You may think that lion kind is just a movie for kids,but i think that the ideas in this movie created a flame inside every kid (i was a kid when i watched it).This flame is the desire for power.And it teaches us how powerful people should be.In addition it shows kids that life was never ideal and will never be.Simba was so young when his father was killed and he felt guilty about it,He went far from his place carrying that guilt. he wanted to drop that load so he lived with Timon and Bumba a silly easy life.But the king inside him woke up when his family needed him.IT made me feel that inside every person there is a KING,and it made me to work hard to search for that king inside me. Although scar was a king but the bad spirit inside him,made everything be so miserable. Everyone must watch this movie,it is the type of movies that kids must watch in order to know and understand more about life.Really it summarizes too much things like power,dreams,dealing with obstacles,love... It is really a school...

    A fantastic movie, everything is excellent, the characters, the idea, the drawings, the scenes, everything in this movie is fantastic. Even now that we have the lucky to see cartoons almost real and in 3D, this movie by itself can survive even when it was made almost 20 years ago. I can see this movie as many times as I want and I never will be bored by watching it, by son liked it, and I am sure my grandsons will loved it too, If you haven't watched this movie, you MUST watch it. FANTASTIC! If I could I would rate it as 11 instead of 10.

The Lion King is a visually impressive film to watch mainly because of the epic scale and depth of the African environments. With the exception of "I Just Can't Wait to Be King" which is a major distraction to the film's tone, the songs by Elton John and Tim Rice are pretty solid. "Circle of Life" is the standout song in my opinion and serves as a worthy introduction to a film of this grandness and spectacle. Hans Zimmer's orchestral score is another big standout for me in regards to the film's music, since it serves as a fitting contrast to the large and absorbing images being shown on screen. The voice-over work that stood out the most from the all-star vocal cast was James Earl Jones and Jeremy Irons. James Earl Jones incorporates the right amount of authority, humbleness, and class into his performance as Simba's dad Mufasa as we should expect for a role such as this from such a distinguished actor. Even though he's only present for half the length of the film, I thought Mufasa was one cool father figure. He felt like a real dad in both his playfulness with Simba as well as his seriousness with him about how he isn't as fearless as Simba thinks he is. There's a scene between Simba and Mufasa in which he basically states this which is very well handled and very well done. Very little else can be said about The Lion King that everyone else hasn't already said except that there's a reason why The Lion King is an animated feature that pleases almost everybody. It has comedy, drama, music, and a little bit of something for everybody. As long as movies are a form of entertainment that unifies us all, then a film with something for all of us isn't anything to complain about, is it?

    This is my favourite animated Disney movie ever. It has a good plot, good storyline, good characters and good villains. This movie is a must see for any kid and I'm sure a lot of adults enjoy this movie too. Basically its about a lion cub simba who is future king of the pride lands but his uncle scar wants to be king and so forms a plot to kill simba he doesn't succeed in killing simba but instead kills simbas father. Scar convinces simba that it is his fault his father died to simba feeling upset and guilty runs away. Some scenes are funny and some are sad. This is a movie I could watch over and over simply because its a great movie as I have already said a must see for anyone especially Disney fans. I give this movie an 8 out of 10

    A young lion cub named Simba is born, knowing that he will be the future king of the jungle. But after he is tricked into thinking that he killed his own father, the young cub runs away and goes into exile. When he grows older, he is forced to come back. It's pretty much common knowledge that Lion King is one of the best movies Disney has ever made. It embodies everything that makes Disney so great Â– excellent story, great characters, strong soundtrack, and a very capable cast of actors lending their voices. For me, the story is the best thing. Hamlet is one of my favourite Shakespeare plays, and the writers have done a great job of transferring that to the animal kingdom. The scene between Simba and the ghost of Mufasa, in particular, is very emotional and tugs at the heart-strings. I'm surprised that the film was as short as it was, to be honest, I think it could have been fleshed out a little more. But what we do get is great. Simba also probably ranks up there as one of Disney's greatest creations. It is a brilliantly-crafted character, very well-voiced by Matthew Broderick. As a kid, I remember how beloved Timon and Pumbaa were, but I didn't really see the appeal. Mufasa (James Earl Jones) and Scar (Jeremy Irons) are also very good. Coincidentally, 'The Lion King' marks the first time a major Disney character dies, which once again re-establishes the strength of the story. My only gripe with this movie is probably just the length. A little more time and the film could have been even better. But between the emotion, the brilliant songs ('Circle Of Life' is my personal favourite) and the fun characters, you have a classic. Not just a Disney classic, but a cinema classic. I'll stop masturbating now.

    That was the first movie I've ever watched in a cinema. I was a kid and I remember crying while watching - I was in love with the characters and I was feeling them. They felt so real to me. Now... actually, as a grown person, now is the same. Characters are so believable and so realistic. Watching the movie as an adult brings a whole new meaning. The good and the bad characters from the movie are like the people I meet everyday in real life. The story is full of morals which I think are really important for young kids these days. I think that The Lion King is a must for every child and adult! With it's characters and plot, it can really move you and the kids might actually learn something from it. It is far better than modern cartoons full of meaningless action and dialogue.

    I am generally not into animated films too much, although I have seen quite a few of them down the years. Yet, there are a few that have generated into classics. The Lion King is undoubtedly one of these . This is a truly wonderful production that combines all Disney's best assets together. Firstly, the animation In 'the lion king' is way ahead of its time. Created way back in 1994, the movie contains richly drawn animations that reveal genuine feeling and I think this really helps you relate to the characters on a personal level. The music is excellent, although I suppose you wouldn't expect anything less from the legendary Hans Zimmer. Yet the story itself is surprisingly powerful for an animation and is deep in emotional resonance. Yet it is humorous at the same time which is truly a winning combination to master. I believe that 'The Lion King' is in short, the best animated feature of all time. With groundbreaking animation and voice acting as well as a memorable array of characters , this is a movie to be enjoyed worldwide by both the young and old (and inbetween).

    You may think that lion kind is just a movie for kids,but i think that the ideas in this movie created a flame inside every kid (i was a kid when i watched it).This flame is the desire for power.And it teaches us how powerful people should be.In addition it shows kids that life was never ideal and will never be.Simba was so young when his father was killed and he felt guilty about it,He went far from his place carrying that guilt. he wanted to drop that load so he lived with Timon and Bumba a silly easy life.But the king inside him woke up when his family needed him.IT made me feel that inside every person there is a KING,and it made me to work hard to search for that king inside me. Although scar was a king but the bad spirit inside him,made everything be so miserable. Everyone must watch this movie,it is the type of movies that kids must watch in order to know and understand more about life.Really it summarizes too much things like power,dreams,dealing with obstacles,love... It is really a school...

    A fantastic movie, everything is excellent, the characters, the idea, the drawings, the scenes, everything in this movie is fantastic. Even now that we have the lucky to see cartoons almost real and in 3D, this movie by itself can survive even when it was made almost 20 years ago. I can see this movie as many times as I want and I never will be bored by watching it, by son liked it, and I am sure my grandsons will loved it too, If you haven't watched this movie, you MUST watch it. FANTASTIC! If I could I would rate it as 11 instead of 10.

    This is a powerful and beautiful story, it was actually the first movie to make me cry as a kid. Not to mention it is also very fun and can be light and has a great comical aspect as well. You really do fall in love with the characters and their stories. The music composition is also awesome. They have a lot of great fun songs that are catchy and get stuck in your head even years later trust me. Elton John also composed some awesome original music for the film so it also has a romantic and love context within the film as well. It is a great film to say the least and the story is very powerful making it a must watch for kids and adults.

    This is the favorite Disney movie for a lot of people, and I'd be lying if I said it wasn't my favorite Disney animated movie as well. I FREAKIN' LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! CAN YOU SPELL AWESOME?!? This movie is incredible! It's amazing how it touches all generations of people (not just kids) who see it! Young Simba is a lion cub growing up in Eastern Africa (that's where the Swahili language is spoken) as his father, King Mufasa, shows him the way of being king. Mufasa's brother, Scar, is angry, however, because he wanted to be king and will now never get that chance. That is, unless he kills his brother and nephew. After a climactic scene in which Mufasa is thrown off a cliff into a stampede of wilder beasts, Simba believes he is responsible for the death of his father and runs away from home. While gone, he meets two colorful characters, Timon and Pumbaa, who teach him to forget about his worries and strife (not the Bare Necessities, but Hakuna Matata). But this gets compromised when his childhood friend, Nala, comes telling him the horrific events of Scar's leadership over the kingdom. He can either continue living Hakuna Matata, or go back home and own up to his responsibilities. For as great as this movie is, I'd be lying if I said there weren't problems I had with it. Number one, why didn't Scar just kill Simba instead of convincing him to run away? I thought it was because he didn't want Simba's blood on his hands, but that can't be true because he already has Mufasa'a blood on his hands. Number two, Scar could have easily have been Disney's finest villain ever! He's smart, classy, and had the guts to kill his own brother and nephew for the sake of power! He even has a Nazi troupe of hyenas following him! But in the second half of the movie, he doesn't do anything with his power. He just sits around, soaking up the fact that he's king. LAME! Number three, I don't believe Simba and Nala are in love during the "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" scene. Look at how other Disney characters fall in love, and compare it to these 2 characters. Do you honestly buy that they're in love? I think they just wanted each other's bodies, and they fell in love later and had Kiara at the end of the movie. It's interesting to me that while people always find flaws with this movie, this movie in many cases is still preferred over "Beauty and the Beast," which many claim is a perfect movie. Why is that? I think it's due to the fact that "The Lion King" is more fun and more epic. First of all, this movie is massively epic - it's one of my favorite elements about this film! It's amazing how EVERYTHING is so epic here! "Beauty and the Beast" was epic, too, but not NEARLY as epic as this film! You here it in the music, you see it in the characters, you hear it in the lines, you see it in the backgrounds - YOU SEE IT IN THE FREAKIN' OPENING!!! This is an epic film! Secondly, it's a bit more fun than "Beauty and the Beast." We can have fun with songs like "Be Our Guest" or with characters like Lumiere and Cogsworth, and there are some bright colors as well. But I feel a larger sense of fun in this movie. More characters are allowed to have fun, we see brighter colors and patterns, and there are 2 or 3 fun songs in this film. I also love the music in this film; not just the songs (I LOVE THESE SONGS!!), but also the score of the movie! If the score of this film were a woman, I'd marry her! It's beautiful, and it adds to the epicness of this movie. I love the story. People say this is based on Shakespeare's "Hamlet," but that's technically not true. The makers of this film were developing an epic story, and along the way they realized that there were connections between this and "Hamlet." It wasn't intentional at first, but it became that way later. Plus, there are elements of other epic stories in this film too, like Moses who ran away from home and came back after realizing what he needed to do for his people. But it's awesome, and I love it! I love these characters, all of them! My favorite characters are Mufasa and Rafiki. Mufasa wreaks of power! The reason we hate Scar so much is because he kills Mufasa, who we love so much! He is the father of Disney movie fathers - Disney fathers period! He says one of my favorite lines: "Look inside yourself, Simba. You are more than what you have become." OOOH, that line just OOZES power - just BLEEDS power!!! Rafiki is awesome because he is both funny and wise. He knows just what to say and just what to do for the right moment. He has funny lines like "It means you are a baboon, and I am not!" Yet he knows when to hit Simba over the head with a stick and tell him to learn from his mistakes. Go Rafiki! "The Lion King" may not be a perfect movie, but it is massive and epic enough to be able to touch so many people all over the world. Since its release almost 20 years ago, almost every child has seen it. It's reached not just most children in the world since 1994, but many adults as well. So many people have been impacted by this film, and you can see why. For the few of you who haven't seen it yet, check it out. BOOYIKA!

    Just watched this movie, and I can't believe how good it was. At first when I saw the music and all the poetry i sad "man, this won't be good". How wrong was I. This movie is a story of Simba's character, and the way he became a full grown man although in the beginning He was just a naughty little lion. And the great thing about this movie is that you can learn so much from it, about family relationships and how to find your way in the society. Great movie again... fun to watch especially when Timon & Pumba showed up. Maybe the film was a little bit short, just an hour and a half but overall great movie. 10/10!

    Out of all the animated features that the Walt Disney Company has produced, the film that seems to be the most celebrated nowadays is coincidentally the one that made the most money. That film being their 32nd full-length animated feature, The Lion King (1994). Now the question that I'm sure almost everybody is going to want me to answer is this. Do I think that the hype surrounding this film is well deserved? While I can certainly say that The Lion King is still a good movie, I honestly think that there are better Disney films out there than this one. I know I'm shocking most of America with the comment I just made, so why do I think that The Lion King is not the best Disney picture like everyone else seems to think that it is? We'll delve deeper into that later, but first, let's look at the main plot. Mufasa (James Earl Jones), the ruler of all animals in Africa, and his wife Sarabi have given birth to a young lion cub named Simba. His birth is celebrated of course with him being presented to the other animals of the kingdom by a loyal baboon. Mufasa's brother Scar (Jeremy Irons) is jealous that Simba will succeed Mufasa as king and hatches a plan with the hyenas to kill them off and take the throne for himself. After Mufasa is killed in a stampede, Scar places the blame on Simba for his father's death and orders him to get out of the kingdom forever. Simba almost dies trying to evade his home, but is saved by a meerkat named Timon and a warthog named Pumbaa. Timon and Pumbaa believe that it's okay to stay away from your troubles, and Simba decides to adapt to their laid-back way of life and never go back home. But then, his childhood friend Nala finds Simba and tells him that things are bad back at home with Scar and his hyenas taking over the land and they need him to return and know that he's alive. Given that he thought that he killed his own father, Simba must decide whether or not to challenge his uncle for the throne. I think the lesson one is supposed to obtain from this story is to learn from your past mistakes. This is also where one of the main problems of the movie resides since this particular message wasn't well delivered. Doug Walker, a popular Internet video film critic, made a good point when he said that this film didn't teach him to learn from past mistakes, but to tell people that he didn't do any mistakes. For that matter, I thought the climax really was the weakest part of the film. Between how unnecessarily confusing the content of the dialogue between Scar and Simba is, the distractingly silly moments with the comic relief and the underlying pop culture references ("They call me Mr. Pig!"), and the battle between Simba and Scar in slow motion, the climax does kind of fall flat in contrast with the earlier parts of the film. Another big issue I have with The Lion King is that I felt it didn't explain enough regarding why the hyenas are bad news to the kingdom. Sure, the movie tells us that they wipe the land clean of its grass, water, animals and other resources under the rule of Scar. However, we are given no explanations regarding why the hyenas are such bad creatures as the lions are claiming that they are. For that matter, the film also didn't tell us what made Mufasa and Scar rivals to begin with. I know it's nitpicking, but when a film lacks crucial story details like that, I can't help but penalize it for forgetting to explain more. The animation in The Lion King is spectacular, no doubt about it. Everyone's gone on about how the stampede sequence in particular is outstanding to watch on the big screen and their praise is certainly understandable. The Lion King is a visually impressive film to watch mainly because of the epic scale and depth of the African environments. With the exception of "I Just Can't Wait to Be King" which is a major distraction to the film's tone, the songs by Elton John and Tim Rice are pretty solid. "Circle of Life" is the standout song in my opinion and serves as a worthy introduction to a film of this grandness and spectacle. Hans Zimmer's orchestral score is another big standout for me in regards to the film's music, since it serves as a fitting contrast to the large and absorbing images being shown on screen.

Very little else can be said about The Lion King that everyone else hasn't already said except that there's a reason why The Lion King is an animated feature that pleases almost everybody.

    This is the favorite Disney movie for a lot of people, and I'd be lying if I said it wasn't my favorite Disney animated movie as well. I FREAKIN' LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! CAN YOU SPELL AWESOME?!? This movie is incredible! It's amazing how it touches all generations of people (not just kids) who see it! Young Simba is a lion cub growing up in Eastern Africa (that's where the Swahili language is spoken) as his father, King Mufasa, shows him the way of being king. Mufasa's brother, Scar, is angry, however, because he wanted to be king and will now never get that chance. That is, unless he kills his brother and nephew. After a climactic scene in which Mufasa is thrown off a cliff into a stampede of wilder beasts, Simba believes he is responsible for the death of his father and runs away from home. While gone, he meets two colorful characters, Timon and Pumbaa, who teach him to forget about his worries and strife (not the Bare Necessities, but Hakuna Matata). But this gets compromised when his childhood friend, Nala, comes telling him the horrific events of Scar's leadership over the kingdom. He can either continue living Hakuna Matata, or go back home and own up to his responsibilities. For as great as this movie is, I'd be lying if I said there weren't problems I had with it. Number one, why didn't Scar just kill Simba instead of convincing him to run away? I thought it was because he didn't want Simba's blood on his hands, but that can't be true because he already has Mufasa'a blood on his hands. Number two, Scar could have easily have been Disney's finest villain ever! He's smart, classy, and had the guts to kill his own brother and nephew for the sake of power! He even has a Nazi troupe of hyenas following him! But in the second half of the movie, he doesn't do anything with his power. He just sits around, soaking up the fact that he's king. LAME! Number three, I don't believe Simba and Nala are in love during the "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" scene. Look at how other Disney characters fall in love, and compare it to these 2 characters. Do you honestly buy that they're in love? I think they just wanted each other's bodies, and they fell in love later and had Kiara at the end of the movie. It's interesting to me that while people always find flaws with this movie, this movie in many cases is still preferred over "Beauty and the Beast," which many claim is a perfect movie. Why is that? I think it's due to the fact that "The Lion King" is more fun and more epic. First of all, this movie is massively epic - it's one of my favorite elements about this film! It's amazing how EVERYTHING is so epic here! "Beauty and the Beast" was epic, too, but not NEARLY as epic as this film! You here it in the music, you see it in the characters, you hear it in the lines, you see it in the backgrounds - YOU SEE IT IN THE FREAKIN' OPENING!!! This is an epic film! Secondly, it's a bit more fun than "Beauty and the Beast." We can have fun with songs like "Be Our Guest" or with characters like Lumiere and Cogsworth, and there are some bright colors as well. But I feel a larger sense of fun in this movie. More characters are allowed to have fun, we see brighter colors and patterns, and there are 2 or 3 fun songs in this film. I also love the music in this film; not just the songs (I LOVE THESE SONGS!!), but also the score of the movie! If the score of this film were a woman, I'd marry her! It's beautiful, and it adds to the epicness of this movie. I love the story. People say this is based on Shakespeare's "Hamlet," but that's technically not true. The makers of this film were developing an epic story, and along the way they realized that there were connections between this and "Hamlet." It wasn't intentional at first, but it became that way later. Plus, there are elements of other epic stories in this film too, like Moses who ran away from home and came back after realizing what he needed to do for his people. But it's awesome, and I love it! I love these characters, all of them! My favorite characters are Mufasa and Rafiki. Mufasa wreaks of power! The reason we hate Scar so much is because he kills Mufasa, who we love so much! He is the father of Disney movie fathers - Disney fathers period! He says one of my favorite lines: "Look inside yourself, Simba. You are more than what you have become." OOOH, that line just OOZES power - just BLEEDS power!!! Rafiki is awesome because he is both funny and wise. He knows just what to say and just what to do for the right moment. He has funny lines like "It means you are a baboon, and I am not!" Yet he knows when to hit Simba over the head with a stick and tell him to learn from his mistakes. Go Rafiki! "The Lion King" may not be a perfect movie, but it is massive and epic enough to be able to touch so many people all over the world. Since its release almost 20 years ago, almost every child has seen it. It's reached not just most children in the world since 1994, but many adults as well. So many people have been impacted by this film, and you can see why. For the few of you who haven't seen it yet, check it out. BOOYIKA!

    Just watched this movie, and I can't believe how good it was. At first when I saw the music and all the poetry i sad "man, this won't be good". How wrong was I. This movie is a story of Simba's character, and the way he became a full grown man although in the beginning He was just a naughty little lion. And the great thing about this movie is that you can learn so much from it, about family relationships and how to find your way in the society. Great movie again... fun to watch especially when Timon & Pumba showed up. Maybe the film was a little bit short, just an hour and a half but overall great movie. 10/10!

    Out of all the animated features that the Walt Disney Company has produced, the film that seems to be the most celebrated nowadays is coincidentally the one that made the most money. That film being their 32nd full-length animated feature, The Lion King (1994). Now the question that I'm sure almost everybody is going to want me to answer is this. Do I think that the hype surrounding this film is well deserved? While I can certainly say that The Lion King is still a good movie, I honestly think that there are better Disney films out there than this one. I know I'm shocking most of America with the comment I just made, so why do I think that The Lion King is not the best Disney picture like everyone else seems to think that it is? We'll delve deeper into that later, but first, let's look at the main plot. Mufasa (James Earl Jones), the ruler of all animals in Africa, and his wife Sarabi have given birth to a young lion cub named Simba. His birth is celebrated of course with him being presented to the other animals of the kingdom by a loyal baboon. Mufasa's brother Scar (Jeremy Irons) is jealous that Simba will succeed Mufasa as king and hatches a plan with the hyenas to kill them off and take the throne for himself. After Mufasa is killed in a stampede, Scar places the blame on Simba for his father's death and orders him to get out of the kingdom forever. Simba almost dies trying to evade his home, but is saved by a meerkat named Timon and a warthog named Pumbaa. Timon and Pumbaa believe that it's okay to stay away from your troubles, and Simba decides to adapt to their laid-back way of life and never go back home. But then, his childhood friend Nala finds Simba and tells him that things are bad back at home with Scar and his hyenas taking over the land and they need him to return and know that he's alive. Given that he thought that he killed his own father, Simba must decide whether or not to challenge his uncle for the throne. I think the lesson one is supposed to obtain from this story is to learn from your past mistakes. This is also where one of the main problems of the movie resides since this particular message wasn't well delivered. Doug Walker, a popular Internet video film critic, made a good point when he said that this film didn't teach him to learn from past mistakes, but to tell people that he didn't do any mistakes. For that matter, I thought the climax really was the weakest part of the film. Between how unnecessarily confusing the content of the dialogue between Scar and Simba is, the distractingly silly moments with the comic relief and the underlying pop culture references ("They call me Mr. Pig!"), and the battle between Simba and Scar in slow motion, the climax does kind of fall flat in contrast with the earlier parts of the film. Another big issue I have with The Lion King is that I felt it didn't explain enough regarding why the hyenas are bad news to the kingdom. Sure, the movie tells us that they wipe the land clean of its grass, water, animals and other resources under the rule of Scar. However, we are given no explanations regarding why the hyenas are such bad creatures as the lions are claiming that they are. For that matter, the film also didn't tell us what made Mufasa and Scar rivals to begin with. I know it's nitpicking, but when a film lacks crucial story details like that, I can't help but penalize it for forgetting to explain more. The animation in The Lion King is spectacular, no doubt about it. Everyone's gone on about how the stampede sequence in particular is outstanding to watch on the big screen and their praise is certainly understandable. The Lion King is a visually impressive film to watch mainly because of the epic scale and depth of the African environments. With the exception of "I Just Can't Wait to Be King" which is a major distraction to the film's tone, the songs by Elton John and Tim Rice are pretty solid. "Circle of Life" is the standout song in my opinion and serves as a worthy introduction to a film of this grandness and spectacle. Hans Zimmer's orchestral score is another big standout for me in regards to the film's music, since it serves as a fitting contrast to the large and absorbing images being shown on screen. The voice-over work that stood out the most from the all-star vocal cast was James Earl Jones and Jeremy Irons. James Earl Jones incorporates the right amount of authority, humbleness, and class into his performance as Simba's dad Mufasa as we should expect for a role such as this from such a distinguished actor. Even though he's only present for half the length of the film, I thought Mufasa was one cool father figure. He felt like a real dad in both his playfulness with Simba as well as his seriousness with him about how he isn't as fearless as Simba thinks he is. There's a scene between Simba and Mufasa in which he basically states this which is very well handled and very well done. Very little else can be said about The Lion King that everyone else hasn't already said except that there's a reason why The Lion King is an animated feature that pleases almost everybody. It has comedy, drama, music, and a little bit of something for everybody. As long as movies are a form of entertainment that unifies us all, then a film with something for all of us isn't anything to complain about, is it?

    This is my favourite animated Disney movie ever. It has a good plot, good storyline, good characters and good villains. This movie is a must see for any kid and I'm sure a lot of adults enjoy this movie too. Basically its about a lion cub simba who is future king of the pride lands but his uncle scar wants to be king and so forms a plot to kill simba he doesn't succeed in killing simba but instead kills simbas father. Scar convinces simba that it is his fault his father died to simba feeling upset and guilty runs away. Some scenes are funny and some are sad. This is a movie I could watch over and over simply because its a great movie as I have already said a must see for anyone especially Disney fans. I give this movie an 8 out of 10

    A young lion cub named Simba is born, knowing that he will be the future king of the jungle. But after he is tricked into thinking that he killed his own father, the young cub runs away and goes into exile. When he grows older, he is forced to come back. It's pretty much common knowledge that Lion King is one of the best movies Disney has ever made. It embodies everything that makes Disney so great Â– excellent story, great characters, strong soundtrack, and a very capable cast of actors lending their voices. For me, the story is the best thing. Hamlet is one of my favourite Shakespeare plays, and the writers have done a great job of transferring that to the animal kingdom. The scene between Simba and the ghost of Mufasa, in particular, is very emotional and tugs at the heart-strings. I'm surprised that the film was as short as it was, to be honest, I think it could have been fleshed out a little more. But what we do get is great. Simba also probably ranks up there as one of Disney's greatest creations. It is a brilliantly-crafted character, very well-voiced by Matthew Broderick. As a kid, I remember how beloved Timon and Pumbaa were, but I didn't really see the appeal. Mufasa (James Earl Jones) and Scar (Jeremy Irons) are also very good. Coincidentally, 'The Lion King' marks the first time a major Disney character dies, which once again re-establishes the strength of the story. My only gripe with this movie is probably just the length. A little more time and the film could have been even better. But between the emotion, the brilliant songs ('Circle Of Life' is my personal favourite) and the fun characters, you have a classic. Not just a Disney classic, but a cinema classic. I'll stop masturbating now.

    That was the first movie I've ever watched in a cinema. I was a kid and I remember crying while watching - I was in love with the characters and I was feeling them. They felt so real to me. Now... actually, as a grown person, now is the same. Characters are so believable and so realistic. Watching the movie as an adult brings a whole new meaning. The good and the bad characters from the movie are like the people I meet everyday in real life. The story is full of morals which I think are really important for young kids these days. I think that The Lion King is a must for every child and adult! With it's characters and plot, it can really move you and the kids might actually learn something from it. It is far better than modern cartoons full of meaningless action and dialogue.

    I am generally not into animated films too much, although I have seen quite a few of them down the years. Yet, there are a few that have generated into classics. The Lion King is undoubtedly one of these . This is a truly wonderful production that combines all Disney's best assets together. Firstly, the animation In 'the lion king' is way ahead of its time. Created way back in 1994, the movie contains richly drawn animations that reveal genuine feeling and I think this really helps you relate to the characters on a personal level. The music is excellent, although I suppose you wouldn't expect anything less from the legendary Hans Zimmer. Yet the story itself is surprisingly powerful for an animation and is deep in emotional resonance. Yet it is humorous at the same time which is truly a winning combination to master. I believe that 'The Lion King' is in short, the best animated feature of all time. With groundbreaking animation and voice acting as well as a memorable array of characters , this is a movie to be enjoyed worldwide by both the young and old (and inbetween).

    You may think that lion kind is just a movie for kids,but i think that the ideas in this movie created a flame inside every kid (i was a kid when i watched it).This flame is the desire for power.And it teaches us how powerful people should be.In addition it shows kids that life was never ideal and will never be.Simba was so young when his father was killed and he felt guilty about it,He went far from his place carrying that guilt. he wanted to drop that load so he lived with Timon and Bumba a silly easy life.But the king inside him woke up when his family needed him.IT made me feel that inside every person there is a KING,and it made me to work hard to search for that king inside me. Although scar was a king but the bad spirit inside him,made everything be so miserable. Everyone must watch this movie,it is the type of movies that kids must watch in order to know and understand more about life.Really it summarizes too much things like power,dreams,dealing with obstacles,love... It is really a school...

    A fantastic movie, everything is excellent, the characters, the idea, the drawings, the scenes, everything in this movie is fantastic. Even now that we have the lucky to see cartoons almost real and in 3D, this movie by itself can survive even when it was made almost 20 years ago. I can see this movie as many times as I want and I never will be bored by watching it, by son liked it, and I am sure my grandsons will loved it too, If you haven't watched this movie, you MUST watch it. FANTASTIC! If I could I would rate it as 11 instead of 10.

    This is a powerful and beautiful story, it was actually the first movie to make me cry as a kid. Not to mention it is also very fun and can be light and has a great comical aspect as well. You really do fall in love with the characters and their stories. The music composition is also awesome. They have a lot of great fun songs that are catchy and get stuck in your head even years later trust me. Elton John also composed some awesome original music for the film so it also has a romantic and love context within the film as well. It is a great film to say the least and the story is very powerful making it a must watch for kids and adults.

There's a scene between Simba and Mufasa in which he basically states this which is very well handled and very well done. Very little else can be said about The Lion King that everyone else hasn't already said except that there's a reason why The Lion King is an animated feature that pleases almost everybody. It has comedy, drama, music, and a little bit of something for everybody. As long as movies are a form of entertainment that unifies us all, then a film with something for all of us isn't anything to complain about, is it?

    This is my favourite animated Disney movie ever. It has a good plot, good storyline, good characters and good villains. This movie is a must see for any kid and I'm sure a lot of adults enjoy this movie too. Basically its about a lion cub simba who is future king of the pride lands but his uncle scar wants to be king and so forms a plot to kill simba he doesn't succeed in killing simba but instead kills simbas father. Scar convinces simba that it is his fault his father died to simba feeling upset and guilty runs away. Some scenes are funny and some are sad. This is a movie I could watch over and over simply because its a great movie as I have already said a must see for anyone especially Disney fans. I give this movie an 8 out of 10

    A young lion cub named Simba is born, knowing that he will be the future king of the jungle. But after he is tricked into thinking that he killed his own father, the young cub runs away and goes into exile. When he grows older, he is forced to come back. It's pretty much common knowledge that Lion King is one of the best movies Disney has ever made. It embodies everything that makes Disney so great Â– excellent story, great characters, strong soundtrack, and a very capable cast of actors lending their voices. For me, the story is the best thing. Hamlet is one of my favourite Shakespeare plays, and the writers have done a great job of transferring that to the animal kingdom. The scene between Simba and the ghost of Mufasa, in particular, is very emotional and tugs at the heart-strings. I'm surprised that the film was as short as it was, to be honest, I think it could have been fleshed out a little more. But what we do get is great. Simba also probably ranks up there as one of Disney's greatest creations. It is a brilliantly-crafted character, very well-voiced by Matthew Broderick. As a kid, I remember how beloved Timon and Pumbaa were, but I didn't really see the appeal. Mufasa (James Earl Jones) and Scar (Jeremy Irons) are also very good. Coincidentally, 'The Lion King' marks the first time a major Disney character dies, which once again re-establishes the strength of the story. My only gripe with this movie is probably just the length. A little more time and the film could have been even better. But between the emotion, the brilliant songs ('Circle Of Life' is my personal favourite) and the fun characters, you have a classic. Not just a Disney classic, but a cinema classic. I'll stop masturbating now.

    That was the first movie I've ever watched in a cinema. I was a kid and I remember crying while watching - I was in love with the characters and I was feeling them. They felt so real to me. Now... actually, as a grown person, now is the same. Characters are so believable and so realistic. Watching the movie as an adult brings a whole new meaning. The good and the bad characters from the movie are like the people I meet everyday in real life. The story is full of morals which I think are really important for young kids these days. I think that The Lion King is a must for every child and adult! With it's characters and plot, it can really move you and the kids might actually learn something from it. It is far better than modern cartoons full of meaningless action and dialogue.

    I am generally not into animated films too much, although I have seen quite a few of them down the years. Yet, there are a few that have generated into classics. The Lion King is undoubtedly one of these . This is a truly wonderful production that combines all Disney's best assets together. Firstly, the animation In 'the lion king' is way ahead of its time. Created way back in 1994, the movie contains richly drawn animations that reveal genuine feeling and I think this really helps you relate to the characters on a personal level. The music is excellent, although I suppose you wouldn't expect anything less from the legendary Hans Zimmer. Yet the story itself is surprisingly powerful for an animation and is deep in emotional resonance. Yet it is humorous at the same time which is truly a winning combination to master. I believe that 'The Lion King' is in short, the best animated feature of all time. With groundbreaking animation and voice acting as well as a memorable array of characters , this is a movie to be enjoyed worldwide by both the young and old (and inbetween).

    You may think that lion kind is just a movie for kids,but i think that the ideas in this movie created a flame inside every kid (i was a kid when i watched it).This flame is the desire for power.And it teaches us how powerful people should be.In addition it shows kids that life was never ideal and will never be.Simba was so young when his father was killed and he felt guilty about it,He went far from his place carrying that guilt. he wanted to drop that load so he lived with Timon and Bumba a silly easy life.But the king inside him woke up when his family needed him.IT made me feel that inside every person there is a KING,and it made me to work hard to search for that king inside me. Although scar was a king but the bad spirit inside him,made everything be so miserable. Everyone must watch this movie,it is the type of movies that kids must watch in order to know and understand more about life.Really it summarizes too much things like power,dreams,dealing with obstacles,love... It is really a school...

    A fantastic movie, everything is excellent, the characters, the idea, the drawings, the scenes, everything in this movie is fantastic. Even now that we have the lucky to see cartoons almost real and in 3D, this movie by itself can survive even when it was made almost 20 years ago. I can see this movie as many times as I want and I never will be bored by watching it, by son liked it, and I am sure my grandsons will loved it too, If you haven't watched this movie, you MUST watch it. FANTASTIC! If I could I would rate it as 11 instead of 10.

    This is a powerful and beautiful story, it was actually the first movie to make me cry as a kid. Not to mention it is also very fun and can be light and has a great comical aspect as well. You really do fall in love with the characters and their stories. The music composition is also awesome. They have a lot of great fun songs that are catchy and get stuck in your head even years later trust me. Elton John also composed some awesome original music for the film so it also has a romantic and love context within the film as well. It is a great film to say the least and the story is very powerful making it a must watch for kids and adults.

    This is the favorite Disney movie for a lot of people, and I'd be lying if I said it wasn't my favorite Disney animated movie as well. I FREAKIN' LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! CAN YOU SPELL AWESOME?!? This movie is incredible! It's amazing how it touches all generations of people (not just kids) who see it! Young Simba is a lion cub growing up in Eastern Africa (that's where the Swahili language is spoken) as his father, King Mufasa, shows him the way of being king. Mufasa's brother, Scar, is angry, however, because he wanted to be king and will now never get that chance. That is, unless he kills his brother and nephew. After a climactic scene in which Mufasa is thrown off a cliff into a stampede of wilder beasts, Simba believes he is responsible for the death of his father and runs away from home. While gone, he meets two colorful characters, Timon and Pumbaa, who teach him to forget about his worries and strife (not the Bare Necessities, but Hakuna Matata). But this gets compromised when his childhood friend, Nala, comes telling him the horrific events of Scar's leadership over the kingdom. He can either continue living Hakuna Matata, or go back home and own up to his responsibilities. For as great as this movie is, I'd be lying if I said there weren't problems I had with it. Number one, why didn't Scar just kill Simba instead of convincing him to run away? I thought it was because he didn't want Simba's blood on his hands, but that can't be true because he already has Mufasa'a blood on his hands. Number two, Scar could have easily have been Disney's finest villain ever! He's smart, classy, and had the guts to kill his own brother and nephew for the sake of power! He even has a Nazi troupe of hyenas following him! But in the second half of the movie, he doesn't do anything with his power. He just sits around, soaking up the fact that he's king. LAME! Number three, I don't believe Simba and Nala are in love during the "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" scene. Look at how other Disney characters fall in love, and compare it to these 2 characters. Do you honestly buy that they're in love? I think they just wanted each other's bodies, and they fell in love later and had Kiara at the end of the movie. It's interesting to me that while people always find flaws with this movie, this movie in many cases is still preferred over "Beauty and the Beast," which many claim is a perfect movie. Why is that? I think it's due to the fact that "The Lion King" is more fun and more epic. First of all, this movie is massively epic - it's one of my favorite elements about this film! It's amazing how EVERYTHING is so epic here! "Beauty and the Beast" was epic, too, but not NEARLY as epic as this film! You here it in the music, you see it in the characters, you hear it in the lines, you see it in the backgrounds - YOU SEE IT IN THE FREAKIN' OPENING!!! This is an epic film! Secondly, it's a bit more fun than "Beauty and the Beast." We can have fun with songs like "Be Our Guest" or with characters like Lumiere and Cogsworth, and there are some bright colors as well. But I feel a larger sense of fun in this movie. More characters are allowed to have fun, we see brighter colors and patterns, and there are 2 or 3 fun songs in this film. I also love the music in this film; not just the songs (I LOVE THESE SONGS!!), but also the score of the movie! If the score of this film were a woman, I'd marry her! It's beautiful, and it adds to the epicness of this movie. I love the story. People say this is based on Shakespeare's "Hamlet," but that's technically not true. The makers of this film were developing an epic story, and along the way they realized that there were connections between this and "Hamlet." It wasn't intentional at first, but it became that way later. Plus, there are elements of other epic stories in this film too, like Moses who ran away from home and came back after realizing what he needed to do for his people. But it's awesome, and I love it! I love these characters, all of them! My favorite characters are Mufasa and Rafiki. Mufasa wreaks of power! The reason we hate Scar so much is because he kills Mufasa, who we love so much! He is the father of Disney movie fathers - Disney fathers period! He says one of my favorite lines: "Look inside yourself, Simba. You are more than what you have become." OOOH, that line just OOZES power - just BLEEDS power!!! Rafiki is awesome because he is both funny and wise. He knows just what to say and just what to do for the right moment. He has funny lines like "It means you are a baboon, and I am not!" Yet he knows when to hit Simba over the head with a stick and tell him to learn from his mistakes. Go Rafiki! "The Lion King" may not be a perfect movie, but it is massive and epic enough to be able to touch so many people all over the world. Since its release almost 20 years ago, almost every child has seen it. It's reached not just most children in the world since 1994, but many adults as well. So many people have been impacted by this film, and you can see why. For the few of you who haven't seen it yet, check it out. BOOYIKA!

    Just watched this movie, and I can't believe how good it was. At first when I saw the music and all the poetry i sad "man, this won't be good". How wrong was I. This movie is a story of Simba's character, and the way he became a full grown man although in the beginning He was just a naughty little lion. And the great thing about this movie is that you can learn so much from it, about family relationships and how to find your way in the society. Great movie again... fun to watch especially when Timon & Pumba showed up. Maybe the film was a little bit short, just an hour and a half but overall great movie. 10/10!

    Out of all the animated features that the Walt Disney Company has produced, the film that seems to be the most celebrated nowadays is coincidentally the one that made the most money. That film being their 32nd full-length animated feature, The Lion King (1994). Now the question that I'm sure almost everybody is going to want me to answer is this. Do I think that the hype surrounding this film is well deserved? While I can certainly say that The Lion King is still a good movie, I honestly think that there are better Disney films out there than this one. I know I'm shocking most of America with the comment I just made, so why do I think that The Lion King is not the best Disney picture like everyone else seems to think that it is? We'll delve deeper into that later, but first, let's look at the main plot. Mufasa (James Earl Jones), the ruler of all animals in Africa, and his wife Sarabi have given birth to a young lion cub named Simba. His birth is celebrated of course with him being presented to the other animals of the kingdom by a loyal baboon. Mufasa's brother Scar (Jeremy Irons) is jealous that Simba will succeed Mufasa as king and hatches a plan with the hyenas to kill them off and take the throne for himself. After Mufasa is killed in a stampede, Scar places the blame on Simba for his father's death and orders him to get out of the kingdom forever. Simba almost dies trying to evade his home, but is saved by a meerkat named Timon and a warthog named Pumbaa. Timon and Pumbaa believe that it's okay to stay away from your troubles, and Simba decides to adapt to their laid-back way of life and never go back home. But then, his childhood friend Nala finds Simba and tells him that things are bad back at home with Scar and his hyenas taking over the land and they need him to return and know that he's alive. Given that he thought that he killed his own father, Simba must decide whether or not to challenge his uncle for the throne. I think the lesson one is supposed to obtain from this story is to learn from your past mistakes. This is also where one of the main problems of the movie resides since this particular message wasn't well delivered. Doug Walker, a popular Internet video film critic, made a good point when he said that this film didn't teach him to learn from past mistakes, but to tell people that he didn't do any mistakes. For that matter, I thought the climax really was the weakest part of the film. Between how unnecessarily confusing the content of the dialogue between Scar and Simba is, the distractingly silly moments with the comic relief and the underlying pop culture references ("They call me Mr. Pig!"), and the battle between Simba and Scar in slow motion, the climax does kind of fall flat in contrast with the earlier parts of the film. Another big issue I have with The Lion King is that I felt it didn't explain enough regarding why the hyenas are bad news to the kingdom. Sure, the movie tells us that they wipe the land clean of its grass, water, animals and other resources under the rule of Scar. However, we are given no explanations regarding why the hyenas are such bad creatures as the lions are claiming that they are. For that matter, the film also didn't tell us what made Mufasa and Scar rivals to begin with. I know it's nitpicking, but when a film lacks crucial story details like that, I can't help but penalize it for forgetting to explain more. The animation in The Lion King is spectacular, no doubt about it. Everyone's gone on about how the stampede sequence in particular is outstanding to watch on the big screen and their praise is certainly understandable. The Lion King is a visually impressive film to watch mainly because of the epic scale and depth of the African environments. With the exception of "I Just Can't Wait to Be King" which is a major distraction to the film's tone, the songs by Elton John and Tim Rice are pretty solid. "Circle of Life" is the standout song in my opinion and serves as a worthy introduction to a film of this grandness and spectacle. Hans Zimmer's orchestral score is another big standout for me in regards to the film's music, since it serves as a fitting contrast to the large and absorbing images being shown on screen. The voice-over work that stood out the most from the all-star vocal cast was James Earl Jones and Jeremy Irons. James Earl Jones incorporates the right amount of authority, humbleness, and class into his performance as Simba's dad Mufasa as we should expect for a role such as this from such a distinguished actor. Even though he's only present for half the length of the film, I thought Mufasa was one cool father figure. He felt like a real dad in both his playfulness with Simba as well as his seriousness with him about how he isn't as fearless as Simba thinks he is. There's a scene between Simba and Mufasa in which he basically states this which is very well handled and very well done. Very little else can be said about The Lion King that everyone else hasn't already said except that there's a reason why The Lion King is an animated feature that pleases almost everybody. It has comedy, drama, music, and a little bit of something for everybody. As long as movies are a form of entertainment that unifies us all, then a film with something for all of us isn't anything to complain about, is it?

He can either continue living Hakuna Matata, or go back home and own up to his responsibilities. For as great as this movie is, I'd be lying if I said there weren't problems I had with it. Number one, why didn't Scar just kill Simba instead of convincing him to run away? I thought it was because he didn't want Simba's blood on his hands, but that can't be true because he already has Mufasa'a blood on his hands. Number two, Scar could have easily have been Disney's finest villain ever! He's smart, classy, and had the guts to kill his own brother and nephew for the sake of power! He even has a Nazi troupe of hyenas following him! But in the second half of the movie, he doesn't do anything with his power. He just sits around, soaking up the fact that he's king. LAME! Number three, I don't believe Simba and Nala are in love during the "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" scene. Look at how other Disney characters fall in love, and compare it to these 2 characters. Do you honestly buy that they're in love? I think they just wanted each other's bodies, and they fell in love later and had Kiara at the end of the movie. It's interesting to me that while people always find flaws with this movie, this movie in many cases is still preferred over "Beauty and the Beast," which many claim is a perfect movie. Why is that? I think it's due to the fact that "The Lion King" is more fun and more epic. First of all, this movie is massively epic - it's one of my favorite elements about this film! It's amazing how EVERYTHING is so epic here! "Beauty and the Beast" was epic, too, but not NEARLY as epic as this film! You here it in the music, you see it in the characters, you hear it in the lines, you see it in the backgrounds - YOU SEE IT IN THE FREAKIN' OPENING!!! This is an epic film! Secondly, it's a bit more fun than "Beauty and the Beast." We can have fun with songs like "Be Our Guest" or with characters like Lumiere and Cogsworth, and there are some bright colors as well. But I feel a larger sense of fun in this movie. More characters are allowed to have fun, we see brighter colors and patterns, and there are 2 or 3 fun songs in this film. I also love the music in this film; not just the songs (I LOVE THESE SONGS!!), but also the score of the movie! If the score of this film were a woman, I'd marry her! It's beautiful, and it adds to the epicness of this movie. I love the story. People say this is based on Shakespeare's "Hamlet," but that's technically not true. The makers of this film were developing an epic story, and along the way they realized that there were connections between this and "Hamlet." It wasn't intentional at first, but it became that way later. Plus, there are elements of other epic stories in this film too, like Moses who ran away from home and came back after realizing what he needed to do for his people. But it's awesome, and I love it! I love these characters, all of them! My favorite characters are Mufasa and Rafiki. Mufasa wreaks of power! The reason we hate Scar so much is because he kills Mufasa, who we love so much! He is the father of Disney movie fathers - Disney fathers period! He says one of my favorite lines: "Look inside yourself, Simba. You are more than what you have become." OOOH, that line just OOZES power - just BLEEDS power!!! Rafiki is awesome because he is both funny and wise. He knows just what to say and just what to do for the right moment. He has funny lines like "It means you are a baboon, and I am not!" Yet he knows when to hit Simba over the head with a stick and tell him to learn from his mistakes. Go Rafiki! "The Lion King" may not be a perfect movie, but it is massive and epic enough to be able to touch so many people all over the world. Since its release almost 20 years ago, almost every child has seen it. It's reached not just most children in the world since 1994, but many adults as well. So many people have been impacted by this film, and you can see why. For the few of you who haven't seen it yet, check it out. BOOYIKA!

    Just watched this movie, and I can't believe how good it was. At first when I saw the music and all the poetry i sad "man, this won't be good". How wrong was I. This movie is a story of Simba's character, and the way he became a full grown man although in the beginning He was just a naughty little lion. And the great thing about this movie is that you can learn so much from it, about family relationships and how to find your way in the society. Great movie again... fun to watch especially when Timon & Pumba showed up. Maybe the film was a little bit short, just an hour and a half but overall great movie. 10/10!

    Out of all the animated features that the Walt Disney Company has produced, the film that seems to be the most celebrated nowadays is coincidentally the one that made the most money. That film being their 32nd full-length animated feature, The Lion King (1994). Now the question that I'm sure almost everybody is going to want me to answer is this. Do I think that the hype surrounding this film is well deserved? While I can certainly say that The Lion King is still a good movie, I honestly think that there are better Disney films out there than this one. I know I'm shocking most of America with the comment I just made, so why do I think that The Lion King is not the best Disney picture like everyone else seems to think that it is? We'll delve deeper into that later, but first, let's look at the main plot. Mufasa (James Earl Jones), the ruler of all animals in Africa, and his wife Sarabi have given birth to a young lion cub named Simba. His birth is celebrated of course with him being presented to the other animals of the kingdom by a loyal baboon. Mufasa's brother Scar (Jeremy Irons) is jealous that Simba will succeed Mufasa as king and hatches a plan with the hyenas to kill them off and take the throne for himself. After Mufasa is killed in a stampede, Scar places the blame on Simba for his father's death and orders him to get out of the kingdom forever. Simba almost dies trying to evade his home, but is saved by a meerkat named Timon and a warthog named Pumbaa. Timon and Pumbaa believe that it's okay to stay away from your troubles, and Simba decides to adapt to their laid-back way of life and never go back home. But then, his childhood friend Nala finds Simba and tells him that things are bad back at home with Scar and his hyenas taking over the land and they need him to return and know that he's alive. Given that he thought that he killed his own father, Simba must decide whether or not to challenge his uncle for the throne. I think the lesson one is supposed to obtain from this story is to learn from your past mistakes. This is also where one of the main problems of the movie resides since this particular message wasn't well delivered. Doug Walker, a popular Internet video film critic, made a good point when he said that this film didn't teach him to learn from past mistakes, but to tell people that he didn't do any mistakes. For that matter, I thought the climax really was the weakest part of the film. Between how unnecessarily confusing the content of the dialogue between Scar and Simba is, the distractingly silly moments with the comic relief and the underlying pop culture references ("They call me Mr. Pig!"), and the battle between Simba and Scar in slow motion, the climax does kind of fall flat in contrast with the earlier parts of the film. Another big issue I have with The Lion King is that I felt it didn't explain enough regarding why the hyenas are bad news to the kingdom. Sure, the movie tells us that they wipe the land clean of its grass, water, animals and other resources under the rule of Scar. However, we are given no explanations regarding why the hyenas are such bad creatures as the lions are claiming that they are. For that matter, the film also didn't tell us what made Mufasa and Scar rivals to begin with. I know it's nitpicking, but when a film lacks crucial story details like that, I can't help but penalize it for forgetting to explain more. The animation in The Lion King is spectacular, no doubt about it. Everyone's gone on about how the stampede sequence in particular is outstanding to watch on the big screen and their praise is certainly understandable. The Lion King is a visually impressive film to watch mainly because of the epic scale and depth of the African environments. With the exception of "I Just Can't Wait to Be King" which is a major distraction to the film's tone, the songs by Elton John and Tim Rice are pretty solid. "Circle of Life" is the standout song in my opinion and serves as a worthy introduction to a film of this grandness and spectacle. Hans Zimmer's orchestral score is another big standout for me in regards to the film's music, since it serves as a fitting contrast to the large and absorbing images being shown on screen. The voice-over work that stood out the most from the all-star vocal cast was James Earl Jones and Jeremy Irons. James Earl Jones incorporates the right amount of authority, humbleness, and class into his performance as Simba's dad Mufasa as we should expect for a role such as this from such a distinguished actor. Even though he's only present for half the length of the film, I thought Mufasa was one cool father figure. He felt like a real dad in both his playfulness with Simba as well as his seriousness with him about how he isn't as fearless as Simba thinks he is. There's a scene between Simba and Mufasa in which he basically states this which is very well handled and very well done. Very little else can be said about The Lion King that everyone else hasn't already said except that there's a reason why The Lion King is an animated feature that pleases almost everybody. It has comedy, drama, music, and a little bit of something for everybody. As long as movies are a form of entertainment that unifies us all, then a film with something for all of us isn't anything to complain about, is it?

    This is my favourite animated Disney movie ever. It has a good plot, good storyline, good characters and good villains. This movie is a must see for any kid and I'm sure a lot of adults enjoy this movie too. Basically its about a lion cub simba who is future king of the pride lands but his uncle scar wants to be king and so forms a plot to kill simba he doesn't succeed in killing simba but instead kills simbas father. Scar convinces simba that it is his fault his father died to simba feeling upset and guilty runs away. Some scenes are funny and some are sad. This is a movie I could watch over and over simply because its a great movie as I have already said a must see for anyone especially Disney fans. I give this movie an 8 out of 10

    A young lion cub named Simba is born, knowing that he will be the future king of the jungle. But after he is tricked into thinking that he killed his own father, the young cub runs away and goes into exile. When he grows older, he is forced to come back. It's pretty much common knowledge that Lion King is one of the best movies Disney has ever made. It embodies everything that makes Disney so great Â– excellent story, great characters, strong soundtrack, and a very capable cast of actors lending their voices. For me, the story is the best thing. Hamlet is one of my favourite Shakespeare plays, and the writers have done a great job of transferring that to the animal kingdom. The scene between Simba and the ghost of Mufasa, in particular, is very emotional and tugs at the heart-strings. I'm surprised that the film was as short as it was, to be honest, I think it could have been fleshed out a little more. But what we do get is great. Simba also probably ranks up there as one of Disney's greatest creations. It is a brilliantly-crafted character, very well-voiced by Matthew Broderick. As a kid, I remember how beloved Timon and Pumbaa were, but I didn't really see the appeal. Mufasa (James Earl Jones) and Scar (Jeremy Irons) are also very good. Coincidentally, 'The Lion King' marks the first time a major Disney character dies, which once again re-establishes the strength of the story. My only gripe with this movie is probably just the length. A little more time and the film could have been even better. But between the emotion, the brilliant songs ('Circle Of Life' is my personal favourite) and the fun characters, you have a classic. Not just a Disney classic, but a cinema classic. I'll stop masturbating now.

    That was the first movie I've ever watched in a cinema. I was a kid and I remember crying while watching - I was in love with the characters and I was feeling them. They felt so real to me. Now... actually, as a grown person, now is the same. Characters are so believable and so realistic. Watching the movie as an adult brings a whole new meaning. The good and the bad characters from the movie are like the people I meet everyday in real life. The story is full of morals which I think are really important for young kids these days. I think that The Lion King is a must for every child and adult! With it's characters and plot, it can really move you and the kids might actually learn something from it. It is far better than modern cartoons full of meaningless action and dialogue.

    I am generally not into animated films too much, although I have seen quite a few of them down the years. Yet, there are a few that have generated into classics. The Lion King is undoubtedly one of these . This is a truly wonderful production that combines all Disney's best assets together. Firstly, the animation In 'the lion king' is way ahead of its time. Created way back in 1994, the movie contains richly drawn animations that reveal genuine feeling and I think this really helps you relate to the characters on a personal level. The music is excellent, although I suppose you wouldn't expect anything less from the legendary Hans Zimmer. Yet the story itself is surprisingly powerful for an animation and is deep in emotional resonance. Yet it is humorous at the same time which is truly a winning combination to master. I believe that 'The Lion King' is in short, the best animated feature of all time. With groundbreaking animation and voice acting as well as a memorable array of characters , this is a movie to be enjoyed worldwide by both the young and old (and inbetween).

    You may think that lion kind is just a movie for kids,but i think that the ideas in this movie created a flame inside every kid (i was a kid when i watched it).This flame is the desire for power.And it teaches us how powerful people should be.In addition it shows kids that life was never ideal and will never be.Simba was so young when his father was killed and he felt guilty about it,He went far from his place carrying that guilt. he wanted to drop that load so he lived with Timon and Bumba a silly easy life.But the king inside him woke up when his family needed him.IT made me feel that inside every person there is a KING,and it made me to work hard to search for that king inside me. Although scar was a king but the bad spirit inside him,made everything be so miserable. Everyone must watch this movie,it is the type of movies that kids must watch in order to know and understand more about life.Really it summarizes too much things like power,dreams,dealing with obstacles,love... It is really a school...

    A fantastic movie, everything is excellent, the characters, the idea, the drawings, the scenes, everything in this movie is fantastic. Even now that we have the lucky to see cartoons almost real and in 3D, this movie by itself can survive even when it was made almost 20 years ago. I can see this movie as many times as I want and I never will be bored by watching it, by son liked it, and I am sure my grandsons will loved it too, If you haven't watched this movie, you MUST watch it. FANTASTIC! If I could I would rate it as 11 instead of 10.

    This is a powerful and beautiful story, it was actually the first movie to make me cry as a kid. Not to mention it is also very fun and can be light and has a great comical aspect as well. You really do fall in love with the characters and their stories. The music composition is also awesome. They have a lot of great fun songs that are catchy and get stuck in your head even years later trust me. Elton John also composed some awesome original music for the film so it also has a romantic and love context within the film as well. It is a great film to say the least and the story is very powerful making it a must watch for kids and adults.

    This is the favorite Disney movie for a lot of people, and I'd be lying if I said it wasn't my favorite Disney animated movie as well. I FREAKIN' LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! CAN YOU SPELL AWESOME?!? This movie is incredible! It's amazing how it touches all generations of people (not just kids) who see it! Young Simba is a lion cub growing up in Eastern Africa (that's where the Swahili language is spoken) as his father, King Mufasa, shows him the way of being king. Mufasa's brother, Scar, is angry, however, because he wanted to be king and will now never get that chance. That is, unless he kills his brother and nephew. After a climactic scene in which Mufasa is thrown off a cliff into a stampede of wilder beasts, Simba believes he is responsible for the death of his father and runs away from home. While gone, he meets two colorful characters, Timon and Pumbaa, who teach him to forget about his worries and strife (not the Bare Necessities, but Hakuna Matata). But this gets compromised when his childhood friend, Nala, comes telling him the horrific events of Scar's leadership over the kingdom. He can either continue living Hakuna Matata, or go back home and own up to his responsibilities. For as great as this movie is, I'd be lying if I said there weren't problems I had with it.

    This is my favourite animated Disney movie ever. It has a good plot, good storyline, good characters and good villains. This movie is a must see for any kid and I'm sure a lot of adults enjoy this movie too. Basically its about a lion cub simba who is future king of the pride lands but his uncle scar wants to be king and so forms a plot to kill simba he doesn't succeed in killing simba but instead kills simbas father. Scar convinces simba that it is his fault his father died to simba feeling upset and guilty runs away. Some scenes are funny and some are sad. This is a movie I could watch over and over simply because its a great movie as I have already said a must see for anyone especially Disney fans. I give this movie an 8 out of 10

    A young lion cub named Simba is born, knowing that he will be the future king of the jungle. But after he is tricked into thinking that he killed his own father, the young cub runs away and goes into exile. When he grows older, he is forced to come back. It's pretty much common knowledge that Lion King is one of the best movies Disney has ever made. It embodies everything that makes Disney so great Â– excellent story, great characters, strong soundtrack, and a very capable cast of actors lending their voices. For me, the story is the best thing. Hamlet is one of my favourite Shakespeare plays, and the writers have done a great job of transferring that to the animal kingdom. The scene between Simba and the ghost of Mufasa, in particular, is very emotional and tugs at the heart-strings. I'm surprised that the film was as short as it was, to be honest, I think it could have been fleshed out a little more. But what we do get is great. Simba also probably ranks up there as one of Disney's greatest creations. It is a brilliantly-crafted character, very well-voiced by Matthew Broderick. As a kid, I remember how beloved Timon and Pumbaa were, but I didn't really see the appeal. Mufasa (James Earl Jones) and Scar (Jeremy Irons) are also very good. Coincidentally, 'The Lion King' marks the first time a major Disney character dies, which once again re-establishes the strength of the story. My only gripe with this movie is probably just the length. A little more time and the film could have been even better. But between the emotion, the brilliant songs ('Circle Of Life' is my personal favourite) and the fun characters, you have a classic. Not just a Disney classic, but a cinema classic. I'll stop masturbating now.

    That was the first movie I've ever watched in a cinema. I was a kid and I remember crying while watching - I was in love with the characters and I was feeling them. They felt so real to me. Now... actually, as a grown person, now is the same. Characters are so believable and so realistic. Watching the movie as an adult brings a whole new meaning. The good and the bad characters from the movie are like the people I meet everyday in real life. The story is full of morals which I think are really important for young kids these days. I think that The Lion King is a must for every child and adult! With it's characters and plot, it can really move you and the kids might actually learn something from it. It is far better than modern cartoons full of meaningless action and dialogue.

    I am generally not into animated films too much, although I have seen quite a few of them down the years. Yet, there are a few that have generated into classics. The Lion King is undoubtedly one of these . This is a truly wonderful production that combines all Disney's best assets together. Firstly, the animation In 'the lion king' is way ahead of its time. Created way back in 1994, the movie contains richly drawn animations that reveal genuine feeling and I think this really helps you relate to the characters on a personal level. The music is excellent, although I suppose you wouldn't expect anything less from the legendary Hans Zimmer. Yet the story itself is surprisingly powerful for an animation and is deep in emotional resonance. Yet it is humorous at the same time which is truly a winning combination to master. I believe that 'The Lion King' is in short, the best animated feature of all time. With groundbreaking animation and voice acting as well as a memorable array of characters , this is a movie to be enjoyed worldwide by both the young and old (and inbetween).

    You may think that lion kind is just a movie for kids,but i think that the ideas in this movie created a flame inside every kid (i was a kid when i watched it).This flame is the desire for power.And it teaches us how powerful people should be.In addition it shows kids that life was never ideal and will never be.Simba was so young when his father was killed and he felt guilty about it,He went far from his place carrying that guilt. he wanted to drop that load so he lived with Timon and Bumba a silly easy life.But the king inside him woke up when his family needed him.IT made me feel that inside every person there is a KING,and it made me to work hard to search for that king inside me. Although scar was a king but the bad spirit inside him,made everything be so miserable. Everyone must watch this movie,it is the type of movies that kids must watch in order to know and understand more about life.Really it summarizes too much things like power,dreams,dealing with obstacles,love... It is really a school...

    A fantastic movie, everything is excellent, the characters, the idea, the drawings, the scenes, everything in this movie is fantastic. Even now that we have the lucky to see cartoons almost real and in 3D, this movie by itself can survive even when it was made almost 20 years ago. I can see this movie as many times as I want and I never will be bored by watching it, by son liked it, and I am sure my grandsons will loved it too, If you haven't watched this movie, you MUST watch it. FANTASTIC! If I could I would rate it as 11 instead of 10.

    This is a powerful and beautiful story, it was actually the first movie to make me cry as a kid. Not to mention it is also very fun and can be light and has a great comical aspect as well. You really do fall in love with the characters and their stories. The music composition is also awesome. They have a lot of great fun songs that are catchy and get stuck in your head even years later trust me. Elton John also composed some awesome original music for the film so it also has a romantic and love context within the film as well. It is a great film to say the least and the story is very powerful making it a must watch for kids and adults.

    This is the favorite Disney movie for a lot of people, and I'd be lying if I said it wasn't my favorite Disney animated movie as well. I FREAKIN' LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! CAN YOU SPELL AWESOME?!? This movie is incredible! It's amazing how it touches all generations of people (not just kids) who see it! Young Simba is a lion cub growing up in Eastern Africa (that's where the Swahili language is spoken) as his father, King Mufasa, shows him the way of being king. Mufasa's brother, Scar, is angry, however, because he wanted to be king and will now never get that chance. That is, unless he kills his brother and nephew. After a climactic scene in which Mufasa is thrown off a cliff into a stampede of wilder beasts, Simba believes he is responsible for the death of his father and runs away from home. While gone, he meets two colorful characters, Timon and Pumbaa, who teach him to forget about his worries and strife (not the Bare Necessities, but Hakuna Matata). But this gets compromised when his childhood friend, Nala, comes telling him the horrific events of Scar's leadership over the kingdom. He can either continue living Hakuna Matata, or go back home and own up to his responsibilities. For as great as this movie is, I'd be lying if I said there weren't problems I had with it. Number one, why didn't Scar just kill Simba instead of convincing him to run away? I thought it was because he didn't want Simba's blood on his hands, but that can't be true because he already has Mufasa'a blood on his hands. Number two, Scar could have easily have been Disney's finest villain ever! He's smart, classy, and had the guts to kill his own brother and nephew for the sake of power! He even has a Nazi troupe of hyenas following him! But in the second half of the movie, he doesn't do anything with his power. He just sits around, soaking up the fact that he's king. LAME! Number three, I don't believe Simba and Nala are in love during the "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" scene. Look at how other Disney characters fall in love, and compare it to these 2 characters. Do you honestly buy that they're in love? I think they just wanted each other's bodies, and they fell in love later and had Kiara at the end of the movie. It's interesting to me that while people always find flaws with this movie, this movie in many cases is still preferred over "Beauty and the Beast," which many claim is a perfect movie. Why is that? I think it's due to the fact that "The Lion King" is more fun and more epic. First of all, this movie is massively epic - it's one of my favorite elements about this film! It's amazing how EVERYTHING is so epic here! "Beauty and the Beast" was epic, too, but not NEARLY as epic as this film! You here it in the music, you see it in the characters, you hear it in the lines, you see it in the backgrounds - YOU SEE IT IN THE FREAKIN' OPENING!!! This is an epic film! Secondly, it's a bit more fun than "Beauty and the Beast." We can have fun with songs like "Be Our Guest" or with characters like Lumiere and Cogsworth, and there are some bright colors as well. But I feel a larger sense of fun in this movie. More characters are allowed to have fun, we see brighter colors and patterns, and there are 2 or 3 fun songs in this film. I also love the music in this film; not just the songs (I LOVE THESE SONGS!!), but also the score of the movie! If the score of this film were a woman, I'd marry her! It's beautiful, and it adds to the epicness of this movie. I love the story. People say this is based on Shakespeare's "Hamlet," but that's technically not true. The makers of this film were developing an epic story, and along the way they realized that there were connections between this and "Hamlet." It wasn't intentional at first, but it became that way later. Plus, there are elements of other epic stories in this film too, like Moses who ran away from home and came back after realizing what he needed to do for his people. But it's awesome, and I love it! I love these characters, all of them! My favorite characters are Mufasa and Rafiki. Mufasa wreaks of power! The reason we hate Scar so much is because he kills Mufasa, who we love so much! He is the father of Disney movie fathers - Disney fathers period! He says one of my favorite lines: "Look inside yourself, Simba. You are more than what you have become." OOOH, that line just OOZES power - just BLEEDS power!!! Rafiki is awesome because he is both funny and wise. He knows just what to say and just what to do for the right moment. He has funny lines like "It means you are a baboon, and I am not!" Yet he knows when to hit Simba over the head with a stick and tell him to learn from his mistakes. Go Rafiki! "The Lion King" may not be a perfect movie, but it is massive and epic enough to be able to touch so many people all over the world. Since its release almost 20 years ago, almost every child has seen it. It's reached not just most children in the world since 1994, but many adults as well. So many people have been impacted by this film, and you can see why. For the few of you who haven't seen it yet, check it out. BOOYIKA!

    Just watched this movie, and I can't believe how good it was. At first when I saw the music and all the poetry i sad "man, this won't be good". How wrong was I. This movie is a story of Simba's character, and the way he became a full grown man although in the beginning He was just a naughty little lion. And the great thing about this movie is that you can learn so much from it, about family relationships and how to find your way in the society. Great movie again... fun to watch especially when Timon & Pumba showed up. Maybe the film was a little bit short, just an hour and a half but overall great movie. 10/10!

    Out of all the animated features that the Walt Disney Company has produced, the film that seems to be the most celebrated nowadays is coincidentally the one that made the most money. That film being their 32nd full-length animated feature, The Lion King (1994). Now the question that I'm sure almost everybody is going to want me to answer is this. Do I think that the hype surrounding this film is well deserved? While I can certainly say that The Lion King is still a good movie, I honestly think that there are better Disney films out there than this one. I know I'm shocking most of America with the comment I just made, so why do I think that The Lion King is not the best Disney picture like everyone else seems to think that it is? We'll delve deeper into that later, but first, let's look at the main plot. Mufasa (James Earl Jones), the ruler of all animals in Africa, and his wife Sarabi have given birth to a young lion cub named Simba. His birth is celebrated of course with him being presented to the other animals of the kingdom by a loyal baboon. Mufasa's brother Scar (Jeremy Irons) is jealous that Simba will succeed Mufasa as king and hatches a plan with the hyenas to kill them off and take the throne for himself. After Mufasa is killed in a stampede, Scar places the blame on Simba for his father's death and orders him to get out of the kingdom forever. Simba almost dies trying to evade his home, but is saved by a meerkat named Timon and a warthog named Pumbaa. Timon and Pumbaa believe that it's okay to stay away from your troubles, and Simba decides to adapt to their laid-back way of life and never go back home. But then, his childhood friend Nala finds Simba and tells him that things are bad back at home with Scar and his hyenas taking over the land and they need him to return and know that he's alive. Given that he thought that he killed his own father, Simba must decide whether or not to challenge his uncle for the throne. I think the lesson one is supposed to obtain from this story is to learn from your past mistakes. This is also where one of the main problems of the movie resides since this particular message wasn't well delivered. Doug Walker, a popular Internet video film critic, made a good point when he said that this film didn't teach him to learn from past mistakes, but to tell people that he didn't do any mistakes. For that matter, I thought the climax really was the weakest part of the film. Between how unnecessarily confusing the content of the dialogue between Scar and Simba is, the distractingly silly moments with the comic relief and the underlying pop culture references ("They call me Mr. Pig!"), and the battle between Simba and Scar in slow motion, the climax does kind of fall flat in contrast with the earlier parts of the film. Another big issue I have with The Lion King is that I felt it didn't explain enough regarding why the hyenas are bad news to the kingdom. Sure, the movie tells us that they wipe the land clean of its grass, water, animals and other resources under the rule of Scar. However, we are given no explanations regarding why the hyenas are such bad creatures as the lions are claiming that they are. For that matter, the film also didn't tell us what made Mufasa and Scar rivals to begin with. I know it's nitpicking, but when a film lacks crucial story details like that, I can't help but penalize it for forgetting to explain more. The animation in The Lion King is spectacular, no doubt about it. Everyone's gone on about how the stampede sequence in particular is outstanding to watch on the big screen and their praise is certainly understandable. The Lion King is a visually impressive film to watch mainly because of the epic scale and depth of the African environments. With the exception of "I Just Can't Wait to Be King" which is a major distraction to the film's tone, the songs by Elton John and Tim Rice are pretty solid. "Circle of Life" is the standout song in my opinion and serves as a worthy introduction to a film of this grandness and spectacle. Hans Zimmer's orchestral score is another big standout for me in regards to the film's music, since it serves as a fitting contrast to the large and absorbing images being shown on screen. The voice-over work that stood out the most from the all-star vocal cast was James Earl Jones and Jeremy Irons. James Earl Jones incorporates the right amount of authority, humbleness, and class into his performance as Simba's dad Mufasa as we should expect for a role such as this from such a distinguished actor. Even though he's only present for half the length of the film, I thought Mufasa was one cool father figure. He felt like a real dad in both his playfulness with Simba as well as his seriousness with him about how he isn't as fearless as Simba thinks he is. There's a scene between Simba and Mufasa in which he basically states this which is very well handled and very well done. Very little else can be said about The Lion King that everyone else hasn't already said except that there's a reason why The Lion King is an animated feature that pleases almost everybody. It has comedy, drama, music, and a little bit of something for everybody. As long as movies are a form of entertainment that unifies us all, then a film with something for all of us isn't anything to complain about, is it?
