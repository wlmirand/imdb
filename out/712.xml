 <sinopse>
  A minor car accident drives two rival aluminum-siding salesmen to the ridiculous extremes of man versus man in 1963 Baltimore.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  One step short of larceny, the aluminum siding salesmen in this movie sell their wares, compete with each other, and engage in a lot of great dialog. Tin Men focuses on the rivalry between BB Babowsky and Ernest Tilley. At the same time, the end of small world of which they are kings looms near as a government probe investigates their industry.

    Although this is a drama of days long gone, Director Barry Levinson instills a brilliant sense of comedy here, tragic comedy of life. "Tinmen" is the term for aluminum siding film-flam salesmen, there are some fun scenes at the beginning with John Mahoney, showing how they gain a customers trust before selling them on aluminum siding which they don't need. Richard Dreyfus is B.B. Babowsky, who runs Gibraltar Aluminum. He has a call center filled with phone operators from the 1950's. The costumes and sets are funny and kitsch, way before "Mad Men" was a popular show. Danny DeVito as Tilly steals the show at the latter part of the film, he is being stalked by the IRS as well as the "Home Improvement Commission", which seems a take on the McCarthy era of censorship. Set in Baltimore, this film is really a forgotten gem from the late 80's. Well worth a look. 10/10.

    Dealing with the funny rivalry between two aluminum-siding salesmen, "Tin Men" (as what these men are called in their business) excels itself in just being an ordinary comedy, it also paints a portrait of a decade with a updated look at it; the current 1980's seemed to shape a model for these characters and the situations they've been through. One of the films of the 'Baltimore quadrilogy' (the other films being "Diner", "Avalon" and "Liberty Heights"), all directed by Barry Levinson, who lived in the area, this film looks back at the city of the 1960's, most precisely in 1963, where an simple automobile accident between two tin men started a small but funny war between them. On one side we have the energetic Bill 'BB' Babowski (Richard Dreyfuss), who recently acquired a new Cadillac but within five minutes of getting inside of it his car was hit by the too agitated for his height and size Ernest Tilley (Danny DeVito). The two promise revenge on one another and they spend their days trying to prank each other with some help from their friends. And that goes on, with smashing cars, fist fights that will never happen, one trying to score higher than the other until BB makes the smart move of going out with Ernest's wife (Barbara Hershey) and that might backfire in a surprising way for both of these guys. It's not all about rivalry between these two but it's also about how they guarantee their work (through hilarious scams selling aluminum-siding for houses, pretending to be part of Life magazine quoting that it will make the house look better in the magazine's photos and others scams too). Their work, now, is at risk when a commission appears to investigate cases of fraud in their sellings, and it is most likely these guys will be called to testify about what they do, if it's correct or not. But it is in difficult hours like that that the enemy of your enemy is your friend, right? The whole dispute, whether about the sales they do or the pranks these accident resulted, goes to show us a big game with no easy victories, no easy gains but with lots of dishonesty to compensate for the trouble. This was how the minds of the 1980's were looking at the 1960's period, as a place where people took advantage of each other through the simplest things, profit of any kind must be on top of everything. It's never about getting even, it's more about being the king of the game, the winner of all. Levinson is not trying to gives moralistic lessons about that era because he's more concerned about what was funny about all that. Most certainly, he was looking back at that time thinking that this was quite innocent and childish compared to the excesses of the Reaganomics era, period in which this film was made but somehow these two eras seem to be attached here in this nostalgic film. And in the following decades societies have gone way worst than just destroying someone's car... The premise, despite some lack of originality, perfectly works; the movie is warmly funny, not only in the arguments between DeVito and Dreyfuss but also in the talks they have with their friends (played by John Mahoney, Bruno Kirby, Richard Portnow, Seymour Cassel and others), one of these talks concerning about the irrealism during the cowboys talks in "Bonanza" (again, a contemporary look of the past, people wouldn't notice back then these kind of problems in the TV show). Notice the great soundtrack made by one of the groups of the moment, the Fine Young Cannibals, who appear in the film as band members of a nightclub often visited by both groups of tin men. Simply irresistible! 10/10

    Barry Levinson's attractively lopsided comedy marked his tentative return to Earth (to be more specific, the city of Baltimore circa 1963) after serving time on the Steven Spielberg assembly line (in 'Young Sherlock Holmes'). The idea of a film depicting the cutthroat antagonism between two aluminum siding salesmen must have been alarming to the people at Touchstone Pictures, who no doubt insisted on certain commercial concessions, including a strictly gratuitous appearance by the pop group Fine Young Cannibals (out of place in the early '60s setting), and the casting of two high-profile names in the title roles (an allusion to the heartless hero of Oz). Danny DeVito and Richard Dreyfuss portray the disreputable rival salesmen who become mortal enemies after a minor fender bender dings their new Cadillacs. Both are reliable comic talents, but the highlights of the film are the lengthy digressions from the plot, with a (largely unknown) cast of supporting actors improvising loopy, crisscrossing conversation over coffee and donuts. Despite the effort Levinson may have put into his screenplay it's the unscripted banter that leaves the best impression, winning points for unpredictability in an original but otherwise uneven comedy.

    Tin Men (Barry Levinson, 1987) is a nifty examination of the American Dream, focusing on a pair of aluminum-siding salesmen in early-'60s Baltimore who engage in an escalating campaign of retribution after their Cadillacs collide. Richard Dreyfuss is a sharp-shooting huckster in a powder blue suit, Danny DeVito a down-on-his-luck nighthawk trying to stay in the game. Just as they rely on sheen and trickery to flog their wares, so the film inveigles its way in with a succession of comic episodes, before revealing itself as an incisive take on the artifice of materialism and machismo - and a compelling character piece. It flirts with the hustlers' romanticised image of themselves, but also shows the reality: they're just a bunch of fraudsters, flogging the American Dream. Tin Men is a subtle, masterfully-crafted little film, boosted by strong performances from the leads (rough edges and fluffed lines intact), nice supporting turns - including Barbara Hershey as DeVito's put-upon wife - and writer-director Barry Levinson's terrific ear for dialogue. His script is realistic but finely-honed and, years before Tarantino provided his own post-modern take on eatery conversation (and some five years after Levinson's own Diner), offers several servings of pop-culture-savvy squabbling that complement the movie's more ambitious elements. There's one excellent exchange in which DeVito tells his friends he'd never seen Dreyfuss before the crash, only to find that pal Stanley Brock won't let it lie. "You musta seen him. He hangs out with Carly Benelli, Cheese... you know, that group," he says. "Don't you remember, he was up at the Corral one night when we there... he's a good dancer. You must have seen him." Eventually DeVito tires of being told what slick moves his adversary has, retorting: "What do you want me to do, date him? What do I give a (expletive deleted) if he's a good dancer?" "I tell you, if I was a girl I would be very impressed," Brock replies. "You're not a girl and you're impressed," counters friend Jackie Gayle. Another of the film's strengths lies in its original plotting: it's almost impossible to second-guess where the story is heading, particularly in the first half. While the next hour does offer some concessions to conventionality, they're entirely in keeping with the characters' shifting mind-sets, and there's generally another trick or two up Levinson's apparently bottomless sleeve. The subplot about the Maryland Home Improvement Commission clamping down on bad practice is perfect. That's not to say the film doesn't have flaws - there are occasional lulls, and a bit more context wouldn't go amiss - but that it's welcome to find a movie so assured in its value, intelligence and razor-sharp sense of humour that the director lets you discover its qualities for yourself. A movie so well-handled that even the way busted scammers hand in their licenses is a snapshot of their characters. Levinson also makes a neat job of paraphrasing the era, with simple but effective production design, smart credits and a first-rate song score by '60s-soundalikes Fine Young Cannibals. What starts off as a lively story of obsession and revenge - a funny spin on The Duellists, if you will - ultimately ends up as something more intriguing, durable and worthwhile. And the draft drawings of my revamped house look just about good enough for Life Magazine. I'm covering the place in siding.

    Dreyfus vs Louis: Levinson's Entertaining Study of Baltimore Sales Scammers

    If you really want to find the essence of American urban life in the 1950's and 1960's, just spend a few hours at either an east-coast diner or in a 1960 Cadillac. Sometimes I think Barry Levinson must have owned a Cadillac and driven to diners where he overheard dialog which he scribbled into a notebook. (His first movie was of course called "Diner".) Levinson has captured the atmosphere of the era through his realistic dialog that seems lifted straight from the dirty tables and dry pancakes. A bunch of friends eating at a diner and yapping about TV shows and broads is what real east-coast urban American life is all about. And when these guys are not drinking coffee and dividing up the check, they're driving their Cadillacs to potential customers to sell aluminum siding. This is the second of Levinson's Baltimore trilogy. The term "tin men" referred to aluminum siding salesmen who were just a cut under car salesmen and just above con artists. In the 1950's and 1960's when competition tightened, some of these salesmen used seemingly innocent but deceptive tactics on a very naive and trusting public who have since gotten very wise to this kind of manipulation. These hard-sell approaches included bate and switch, falsely promising free extras, and fabricating associations with nationwide magazines. Barry Levinson thrusts us into the middle of a rivalry between two of the more devious of aluminum siding salesmen, played by two of the most nervous-angst actors in the business: Danny DeVito and Richard Dreyfus. The casting of these two against each other has to have been from heaven. The smart-alec Dreyfus versus the self-centered DeVito makes for a clash of the urban sales titans early 1960's style. DeVito and Dreyfus literally "run into each other" and begin a heated game of oneupmanship that at first involves their cars and then DeVito's wife played with subtle realism by Barbara Hershey. (Of course the biggest mystery of the film is how Hershey ended up with DeVito in the first place but that could be the subject of a PhD dissertation.) The cars owned by the salesmen are important enough to also be characters. This game of king of the hill is at the forefront of the shady practices enacted by the tin men to get customers. Some of the most interesting aspects of the film are the games they play to make sales. Their customers are often very simple and trusting folk who don't realize they are being taken by sharks. But looming in the background is the US Housing Commission who are starting to become wise to their practices. A very enjoyable film overall, completely unpredictable, with fantastic performances by the three leads DeVito, Dreyfus, and Hershey. Of course, would you buy anything from these guys? I'm sure you never thought your house could use some aluminum siding.

    These days we seem to have increasing numbers of movies with special fx and huge budgets but poorly drawn characters and plots. Tin Men is one of my favourite movies for 6 reasons: 1 It's set in a small world inhabited by Aluminium siding salesmen trying to sell cladding to cover up the characteristic Baltimore brick Clook and with the backdrop of a 'Home Improvement Commission' set to break all of the salesmen's scams. The scams and backdrop are really amusing. 2 The backdrop allows some real characters to shine - hopes and fears, they're very believable recognisable characters. And rounded characters. And the movie is full of fantastic cameos. 3 The plot is fantastic. It has a beginning, middle and end, and the it builds and is finely structured with the hints of what is going to happen woven in a carefully constructed progression. It has an economical structure with some believable and clear plot twists. Fantastic writing and editing. 4 The actors and setting are bullet proof. 1963 Baltimore is perfect and Richard Dreyfus, Danny deVito, and Barbara Hershey as the leads are perfection. 5 The sound track is just great. I hate most of this sort of music cold but it is an integral part of the plot. The Fine Young Cannibals, heading by the unmistakable voice of Roland Gift singing 'Good Thing' is also brilliant. Things to watch - when Tilly (deVito) has made what he thinks is his comeback sale and they go to the bar and FTC are singing,- the atmosphere shots in the bar of all the punters is one of my favourite movie moments. - When Sam describes finding God at the smorgasboard and then later when Tilly tries to have his own spirtual experience at a smorgasboard. - The sales scene near the beginning of the film where we learn about the industry - the growing feud between the two main protagonists - Tilly appearing before the commission - the diner lunches that Tilly's team have when they keep going on about TV (Bonanza and other shows). I think this is Barry Levinson's best work.

    I think it is among the best movies i've ever seen. It gives me somehow a good feeling every time i watch it. The life of the two characters played by Danny DeVito and Richard Dreyfuss could be the life of any of us. It makes the movie smell like real life. It is a simple story about a simple life of some "special" tin agents struggling for survival in a non friendly political environment. They only want to sell their product. They have many tricks to do that. The two characters are in the same industry but they have turned against each other because of a simple and minor car accident. As the story develops we can look into the life of the two characters. See their friends, their family their problems their happiness. We don't know who is the good guy and who is the bad one. The point is, after the movie we just simple start loving both of the characters just because they are as human as just any of us. There is no action, blood and sex in this movie just the story of some ordinary people but with so much humor, love and sense that you can't miss it!

    I saw this when it first came out, and I said to everyone- "this has one of the best soundtracks I have heard in a long while". I kept telling everyone that the song in the background-which is of course, "Good Thing" when Dreyfuss is kind of jigging thru the bar, was a great song, with a very catchy melody. So, I was not surprised at all, when the Fine Young Cannibals CD, "The Raw and the Cooked" released after this film- went all the way to the top (it contained 2 songs from this film) That said, I LOVE the storyline, the acting, Richard Dreyfuss is adorable, looks wise and character wise. I loved him in "The Goodbye Girl" but LOVED him in this! The funniest scene in my opinion involves Danny DeVito, at the buffet, I will not spoil it-but I thought it was hysterical! Barbara Hershey BEFORE she had collagen lips-is charming too. Highly recommend and I want this in my DVD collection!!!

    Who would have thought that the frantic Bellboy in Mel Brooks' High Anxiety could write and direct a script of this subtlety? Being in 3 Mel Brooks films thankfully did not seem to affect him. This film is a 9 if not a 10, and repays repeated viewing , for the script,the direction,and the acting (everyone is superb,but Dreyfuss, Hershey,and DeVito are absolutely terrific).The period setting,as far as I can tell,is spot on. The reference to a future VW dealership for BB/Tilley,referred to in other comments(hinted at twice in the film) seems to miss the 'Golden Arch' that fills the final frame. The future might have been burgers as well as beetles! High Anxiety, on the other hand,represented the beginning of the end for Mel Brooks after the brilliance of The Producers,Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein.The only good thing in any otherwise VERY boring High Anxiety is Mel Brooks' hilarious impersonation of Frank Sinatra singing the title song.The rest is a very laboured and dire parody of Hitchcock, where Young Frankenstein was fresh and sustained parody of James Whale's films.

    Oddball, retro films like this never make the all-time top 100 lists  like one of its characters, "Tin Men" comes across as a bit of a small guy, not one of life's winners. But you're missing something quite special if you let the sound of the film put you off. Two rival salesmen in a tough market play dirtier and dirtier in a childish tit-for-tat game, raising a storm of revenge and recrimination until they drag long-suffering wife Barbara Hershey into their fight, raising the stakes for them all. Crackling with expertly ad-libbed dialogue from actors who are clearly enjoying themselves, it's like a masterclass in flowing, naturalistic dialogue  and it's very, very funny. Richard Dreyfus (he reminds me of Richard Widmark  a reliable character actor who never gets his due) and Danny DeVito are a marvel of casting perfection. Scenes such as those in the diner where the rival groups of tin men chew the fat in their own unique and entertaining ways, show pale imitators how it's done: shame on all modern Hollywood scripts that pad out a weak story by having actors babble a great deal of nonsense, very fast (Lethal Weapon 4, anyone?). I hate films about salesmen: that isn't what this is. "Tin Men" has rounded characters in a believably drawn world (in which a man's car might just come higher up the list than his wife) and a story that's really just about human beings who laugh, fail, make mistakes and don't always triumph at the end  shot and scripted with a light touch. I'd recommend you make this one you try and watch, if you can ever find it playing. A rare treat.

While the next hour does offer some concessions to conventionality, they're entirely in keeping with the characters' shifting mind-sets, and there's generally another trick or two up Levinson's apparently bottomless sleeve. The subplot about the Maryland Home Improvement Commission clamping down on bad practice is perfect. That's not to say the film doesn't have flaws - there are occasional lulls, and a bit more context wouldn't go amiss - but that it's welcome to find a movie so assured in its value, intelligence and razor-sharp sense of humour that the director lets you discover its qualities for yourself. A movie so well-handled that even the way busted scammers hand in their licenses is a snapshot of their characters. Levinson also makes a neat job of paraphrasing the era, with simple but effective production design, smart credits and a first-rate song score by '60s-soundalikes Fine Young Cannibals. What starts off as a lively story of obsession and revenge - a funny spin on The Duellists, if you will - ultimately ends up as something more intriguing, durable and worthwhile. And the draft drawings of my revamped house look just about good enough for Life Magazine. I'm covering the place in siding.

    If you really want to find the essence of American urban life in the 1950's and 1960's, just spend a few hours at either an east-coast diner or in a 1960 Cadillac. Sometimes I think Barry Levinson must have owned a Cadillac and driven to diners where he overheard dialog which he scribbled into a notebook. (His first movie was of course called "Diner".) Levinson has captured the atmosphere of the era through his realistic dialog that seems lifted straight from the dirty tables and dry pancakes. A bunch of friends eating at a diner and yapping about TV shows and broads is what real east-coast urban American life is all about. And when these guys are not drinking coffee and dividing up the check, they're driving their Cadillacs to potential customers to sell aluminum siding. This is the second of Levinson's Baltimore trilogy. The term "tin men" referred to aluminum siding salesmen who were just a cut under car salesmen and just above con artists. In the 1950's and 1960's when competition tightened, some of these salesmen used seemingly innocent but deceptive tactics on a very naive and trusting public who have since gotten very wise to this kind of manipulation. These hard-sell approaches included bate and switch, falsely promising free extras, and fabricating associations with nationwide magazines. Barry Levinson thrusts us into the middle of a rivalry between two of the more devious of aluminum siding salesmen, played by two of the most nervous-angst actors in the business: Danny DeVito and Richard Dreyfus. The casting of these two against each other has to have been from heaven. The smart-alec Dreyfus versus the self-centered DeVito makes for a clash of the urban sales titans early 1960's style. DeVito and Dreyfus literally "run into each other" and begin a heated game of oneupmanship that at first involves their cars and then DeVito's wife played with subtle realism by Barbara Hershey. (Of course the biggest mystery of the film is how Hershey ended up with DeVito in the first place but that could be the subject of a PhD dissertation.) The cars owned by the salesmen are important enough to also be characters. This game of king of the hill is at the forefront of the shady practices enacted by the tin men to get customers. Some of the most interesting aspects of the film are the games they play to make sales. Their customers are often very simple and trusting folk who don't realize they are being taken by sharks. But looming in the background is the US Housing Commission who are starting to become wise to their practices. A very enjoyable film overall, completely unpredictable, with fantastic performances by the three leads DeVito, Dreyfus, and Hershey. Of course, would you buy anything from these guys? I'm sure you never thought your house could use some aluminum siding.

    These days we seem to have increasing numbers of movies with special fx and huge budgets but poorly drawn characters and plots. Tin Men is one of my favourite movies for 6 reasons: 1 It's set in a small world inhabited by Aluminium siding salesmen trying to sell cladding to cover up the characteristic Baltimore brick Clook and with the backdrop of a 'Home Improvement Commission' set to break all of the salesmen's scams. The scams and backdrop are really amusing. 2 The backdrop allows some real characters to shine - hopes and fears, they're very believable recognisable characters. And rounded characters. And the movie is full of fantastic cameos. 3 The plot is fantastic. It has a beginning, middle and end, and the it builds and is finely structured with the hints of what is going to happen woven in a carefully constructed progression. It has an economical structure with some believable and clear plot twists. Fantastic writing and editing. 4 The actors and setting are bullet proof. 1963 Baltimore is perfect and Richard Dreyfus, Danny deVito, and Barbara Hershey as the leads are perfection. 5 The sound track is just great. I hate most of this sort of music cold but it is an integral part of the plot. The Fine Young Cannibals, heading by the unmistakable voice of Roland Gift singing 'Good Thing' is also brilliant. Things to watch - when Tilly (deVito) has made what he thinks is his comeback sale and they go to the bar and FTC are singing,- the atmosphere shots in the bar of all the punters is one of my favourite movie moments. - When Sam describes finding God at the smorgasboard and then later when Tilly tries to have his own spirtual experience at a smorgasboard. - The sales scene near the beginning of the film where we learn about the industry - the growing feud between the two main protagonists - Tilly appearing before the commission - the diner lunches that Tilly's team have when they keep going on about TV (Bonanza and other shows). I think this is Barry Levinson's best work.

    I think it is among the best movies i've ever seen. It gives me somehow a good feeling every time i watch it. The life of the two characters played by Danny DeVito and Richard Dreyfuss could be the life of any of us. It makes the movie smell like real life. It is a simple story about a simple life of some "special" tin agents struggling for survival in a non friendly political environment. They only want to sell their product. They have many tricks to do that. The two characters are in the same industry but they have turned against each other because of a simple and minor car accident. As the story develops we can look into the life of the two characters. See their friends, their family their problems their happiness. We don't know who is the good guy and who is the bad one. The point is, after the movie we just simple start loving both of the characters just because they are as human as just any of us. There is no action, blood and sex in this movie just the story of some ordinary people but with so much humor, love and sense that you can't miss it!

    I saw this when it first came out, and I said to everyone- "this has one of the best soundtracks I have heard in a long while". I kept telling everyone that the song in the background-which is of course, "Good Thing" when Dreyfuss is kind of jigging thru the bar, was a great song, with a very catchy melody. So, I was not surprised at all, when the Fine Young Cannibals CD, "The Raw and the Cooked" released after this film- went all the way to the top (it contained 2 songs from this film) That said, I LOVE the storyline, the acting, Richard Dreyfuss is adorable, looks wise and character wise. I loved him in "The Goodbye Girl" but LOVED him in this! The funniest scene in my opinion involves Danny DeVito, at the buffet, I will not spoil it-but I thought it was hysterical! Barbara Hershey BEFORE she had collagen lips-is charming too. Highly recommend and I want this in my DVD collection!!!

    Who would have thought that the frantic Bellboy in Mel Brooks' High Anxiety could write and direct a script of this subtlety? Being in 3 Mel Brooks films thankfully did not seem to affect him. This film is a 9 if not a 10, and repays repeated viewing , for the script,the direction,and the acting (everyone is superb,but Dreyfuss, Hershey,and DeVito are absolutely terrific).The period setting,as far as I can tell,is spot on. The reference to a future VW dealership for BB/Tilley,referred to in other comments(hinted at twice in the film) seems to miss the 'Golden Arch' that fills the final frame. The future might have been burgers as well as beetles! High Anxiety, on the other hand,represented the beginning of the end for Mel Brooks after the brilliance of The Producers,Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein.The only good thing in any otherwise VERY boring High Anxiety is Mel Brooks' hilarious impersonation of Frank Sinatra singing the title song.The rest is a very laboured and dire parody of Hitchcock, where Young Frankenstein was fresh and sustained parody of James Whale's films.

    Oddball, retro films like this never make the all-time top 100 lists  like one of its characters, "Tin Men" comes across as a bit of a small guy, not one of life's winners. But you're missing something quite special if you let the sound of the film put you off. Two rival salesmen in a tough market play dirtier and dirtier in a childish tit-for-tat game, raising a storm of revenge and recrimination until they drag long-suffering wife Barbara Hershey into their fight, raising the stakes for them all. Crackling with expertly ad-libbed dialogue from actors who are clearly enjoying themselves, it's like a masterclass in flowing, naturalistic dialogue  and it's very, very funny. Richard Dreyfus (he reminds me of Richard Widmark  a reliable character actor who never gets his due) and Danny DeVito are a marvel of casting perfection. Scenes such as those in the diner where the rival groups of tin men chew the fat in their own unique and entertaining ways, show pale imitators how it's done: shame on all modern Hollywood scripts that pad out a weak story by having actors babble a great deal of nonsense, very fast (Lethal Weapon 4, anyone?). I hate films about salesmen: that isn't what this is. "Tin Men" has rounded characters in a believably drawn world (in which a man's car might just come higher up the list than his wife) and a story that's really just about human beings who laugh, fail, make mistakes and don't always triumph at the end  shot and scripted with a light touch. I'd recommend you make this one you try and watch, if you can ever find it playing. A rare treat.

    Although this is a drama of days long gone, Director Barry Levinson instills a brilliant sense of comedy here, tragic comedy of life. "Tinmen" is the term for aluminum siding film-flam salesmen, there are some fun scenes at the beginning with John Mahoney, showing how they gain a customers trust before selling them on aluminum siding which they don't need. Richard Dreyfus is B.B. Babowsky, who runs Gibraltar Aluminum. He has a call center filled with phone operators from the 1950's. The costumes and sets are funny and kitsch, way before "Mad Men" was a popular show. Danny DeVito as Tilly steals the show at the latter part of the film, he is being stalked by the IRS as well as the "Home Improvement Commission", which seems a take on the McCarthy era of censorship. Set in Baltimore, this film is really a forgotten gem from the late 80's. Well worth a look. 10/10.

    Dealing with the funny rivalry between two aluminum-siding salesmen, "Tin Men" (as what these men are called in their business) excels itself in just being an ordinary comedy, it also paints a portrait of a decade with a updated look at it; the current 1980's seemed to shape a model for these characters and the situations they've been through. One of the films of the 'Baltimore quadrilogy' (the other films being "Diner", "Avalon" and "Liberty Heights"), all directed by Barry Levinson, who lived in the area, this film looks back at the city of the 1960's, most precisely in 1963, where an simple automobile accident between two tin men started a small but funny war between them. On one side we have the energetic Bill 'BB' Babowski (Richard Dreyfuss), who recently acquired a new Cadillac but within five minutes of getting inside of it his car was hit by the too agitated for his height and size Ernest Tilley (Danny DeVito). The two promise revenge on one another and they spend their days trying to prank each other with some help from their friends. And that goes on, with smashing cars, fist fights that will never happen, one trying to score higher than the other until BB makes the smart move of going out with Ernest's wife (Barbara Hershey) and that might backfire in a surprising way for both of these guys. It's not all about rivalry between these two but it's also about how they guarantee their work (through hilarious scams selling aluminum-siding for houses, pretending to be part of Life magazine quoting that it will make the house look better in the magazine's photos and others scams too). Their work, now, is at risk when a commission appears to investigate cases of fraud in their sellings, and it is most likely these guys will be called to testify about what they do, if it's correct or not. But it is in difficult hours like that that the enemy of your enemy is your friend, right? The whole dispute, whether about the sales they do or the pranks these accident resulted, goes to show us a big game with no easy victories, no easy gains but with lots of dishonesty to compensate for the trouble. This was how the minds of the 1980's were looking at the 1960's period, as a place where people took advantage of each other through the simplest things, profit of any kind must be on top of everything. It's never about getting even, it's more about being the king of the game, the winner of all. Levinson is not trying to gives moralistic lessons about that era because he's more concerned about what was funny about all that. Most certainly, he was looking back at that time thinking that this was quite innocent and childish compared to the excesses of the Reaganomics era, period in which this film was made but somehow these two eras seem to be attached here in this nostalgic film. And in the following decades societies have gone way worst than just destroying someone's car... The premise, despite some lack of originality, perfectly works; the movie is warmly funny, not only in the arguments between DeVito and Dreyfuss but also in the talks they have with their friends (played by John Mahoney, Bruno Kirby, Richard Portnow, Seymour Cassel and others), one of these talks concerning about the irrealism during the cowboys talks in "Bonanza" (again, a contemporary look of the past, people wouldn't notice back then these kind of problems in the TV show). Notice the great soundtrack made by one of the groups of the moment, the Fine Young Cannibals, who appear in the film as band members of a nightclub often visited by both groups of tin men. Simply irresistible! 10/10

    Barry Levinson's attractively lopsided comedy marked his tentative return to Earth (to be more specific, the city of Baltimore circa 1963) after serving time on the Steven Spielberg assembly line (in 'Young Sherlock Holmes'). The idea of a film depicting the cutthroat antagonism between two aluminum siding salesmen must have been alarming to the people at Touchstone Pictures, who no doubt insisted on certain commercial concessions, including a strictly gratuitous appearance by the pop group Fine Young Cannibals (out of place in the early '60s setting), and the casting of two high-profile names in the title roles (an allusion to the heartless hero of Oz). Danny DeVito and Richard Dreyfuss portray the disreputable rival salesmen who become mortal enemies after a minor fender bender dings their new Cadillacs. Both are reliable comic talents, but the highlights of the film are the lengthy digressions from the plot, with a (largely unknown) cast of supporting actors improvising loopy, crisscrossing conversation over coffee and donuts. Despite the effort Levinson may have put into his screenplay it's the unscripted banter that leaves the best impression, winning points for unpredictability in an original but otherwise uneven comedy.

    Tin Men (Barry Levinson, 1987) is a nifty examination of the American Dream, focusing on a pair of aluminum-siding salesmen in early-'60s Baltimore who engage in an escalating campaign of retribution after their Cadillacs collide. Richard Dreyfuss is a sharp-shooting huckster in a powder blue suit, Danny DeVito a down-on-his-luck nighthawk trying to stay in the game. Just as they rely on sheen and trickery to flog their wares, so the film inveigles its way in with a succession of comic episodes, before revealing itself as an incisive take on the artifice of materialism and machismo - and a compelling character piece. It flirts with the hustlers' romanticised image of themselves, but also shows the reality: they're just a bunch of fraudsters, flogging the American Dream. Tin Men is a subtle, masterfully-crafted little film, boosted by strong performances from the leads (rough edges and fluffed lines intact), nice supporting turns - including Barbara Hershey as DeVito's put-upon wife - and writer-director Barry Levinson's terrific ear for dialogue. His script is realistic but finely-honed and, years before Tarantino provided his own post-modern take on eatery conversation (and some five years after Levinson's own Diner), offers several servings of pop-culture-savvy squabbling that complement the movie's more ambitious elements. There's one excellent exchange in which DeVito tells his friends he'd never seen Dreyfuss before the crash, only to find that pal Stanley Brock won't let it lie. "You musta seen him. He hangs out with Carly Benelli, Cheese... you know, that group," he says. "Don't you remember, he was up at the Corral one night when we there... he's a good dancer. You must have seen him." Eventually DeVito tires of being told what slick moves his adversary has, retorting: "What do you want me to do, date him? What do I give a (expletive deleted) if he's a good dancer?" "I tell you, if I was a girl I would be very impressed," Brock replies. "You're not a girl and you're impressed," counters friend Jackie Gayle. Another of the film's strengths lies in its original plotting: it's almost impossible to second-guess where the story is heading, particularly in the first half. While the next hour does offer some concessions to conventionality, they're entirely in keeping with the characters' shifting mind-sets, and there's generally another trick or two up Levinson's apparently bottomless sleeve.

    Oddball, retro films like this never make the all-time top 100 lists  like one of its characters, "Tin Men" comes across as a bit of a small guy, not one of life's winners. But you're missing something quite special if you let the sound of the film put you off. Two rival salesmen in a tough market play dirtier and dirtier in a childish tit-for-tat game, raising a storm of revenge and recrimination until they drag long-suffering wife Barbara Hershey into their fight, raising the stakes for them all. Crackling with expertly ad-libbed dialogue from actors who are clearly enjoying themselves, it's like a masterclass in flowing, naturalistic dialogue  and it's very, very funny. Richard Dreyfus (he reminds me of Richard Widmark  a reliable character actor who never gets his due) and Danny DeVito are a marvel of casting perfection. Scenes such as those in the diner where the rival groups of tin men chew the fat in their own unique and entertaining ways, show pale imitators how it's done: shame on all modern Hollywood scripts that pad out a weak story by having actors babble a great deal of nonsense, very fast (Lethal Weapon 4, anyone?). I hate films about salesmen: that isn't what this is. "Tin Men" has rounded characters in a believably drawn world (in which a man's car might just come higher up the list than his wife) and a story that's really just about human beings who laugh, fail, make mistakes and don't always triumph at the end  shot and scripted with a light touch. I'd recommend you make this one you try and watch, if you can ever find it playing. A rare treat.

    Although this is a drama of days long gone, Director Barry Levinson instills a brilliant sense of comedy here, tragic comedy of life. "Tinmen" is the term for aluminum siding film-flam salesmen, there are some fun scenes at the beginning with John Mahoney, showing how they gain a customers trust before selling them on aluminum siding which they don't need. Richard Dreyfus is B.B. Babowsky, who runs Gibraltar Aluminum. He has a call center filled with phone operators from the 1950's. The costumes and sets are funny and kitsch, way before "Mad Men" was a popular show. Danny DeVito as Tilly steals the show at the latter part of the film, he is being stalked by the IRS as well as the "Home Improvement Commission", which seems a take on the McCarthy era of censorship. Set in Baltimore, this film is really a forgotten gem from the late 80's. Well worth a look. 10/10.

    Dealing with the funny rivalry between two aluminum-siding salesmen, "Tin Men" (as what these men are called in their business) excels itself in just being an ordinary comedy, it also paints a portrait of a decade with a updated look at it; the current 1980's seemed to shape a model for these characters and the situations they've been through. One of the films of the 'Baltimore quadrilogy' (the other films being "Diner", "Avalon" and "Liberty Heights"), all directed by Barry Levinson, who lived in the area, this film looks back at the city of the 1960's, most precisely in 1963, where an simple automobile accident between two tin men started a small but funny war between them. On one side we have the energetic Bill 'BB' Babowski (Richard Dreyfuss), who recently acquired a new Cadillac but within five minutes of getting inside of it his car was hit by the too agitated for his height and size Ernest Tilley (Danny DeVito). The two promise revenge on one another and they spend their days trying to prank each other with some help from their friends. And that goes on, with smashing cars, fist fights that will never happen, one trying to score higher than the other until BB makes the smart move of going out with Ernest's wife (Barbara Hershey) and that might backfire in a surprising way for both of these guys. It's not all about rivalry between these two but it's also about how they guarantee their work (through hilarious scams selling aluminum-siding for houses, pretending to be part of Life magazine quoting that it will make the house look better in the magazine's photos and others scams too). Their work, now, is at risk when a commission appears to investigate cases of fraud in their sellings, and it is most likely these guys will be called to testify about what they do, if it's correct or not. But it is in difficult hours like that that the enemy of your enemy is your friend, right? The whole dispute, whether about the sales they do or the pranks these accident resulted, goes to show us a big game with no easy victories, no easy gains but with lots of dishonesty to compensate for the trouble. This was how the minds of the 1980's were looking at the 1960's period, as a place where people took advantage of each other through the simplest things, profit of any kind must be on top of everything. It's never about getting even, it's more about being the king of the game, the winner of all. Levinson is not trying to gives moralistic lessons about that era because he's more concerned about what was funny about all that. Most certainly, he was looking back at that time thinking that this was quite innocent and childish compared to the excesses of the Reaganomics era, period in which this film was made but somehow these two eras seem to be attached here in this nostalgic film. And in the following decades societies have gone way worst than just destroying someone's car... The premise, despite some lack of originality, perfectly works; the movie is warmly funny, not only in the arguments between DeVito and Dreyfuss but also in the talks they have with their friends (played by John Mahoney, Bruno Kirby, Richard Portnow, Seymour Cassel and others), one of these talks concerning about the irrealism during the cowboys talks in "Bonanza" (again, a contemporary look of the past, people wouldn't notice back then these kind of problems in the TV show). Notice the great soundtrack made by one of the groups of the moment, the Fine Young Cannibals, who appear in the film as band members of a nightclub often visited by both groups of tin men. Simply irresistible! 10/10

    Barry Levinson's attractively lopsided comedy marked his tentative return to Earth (to be more specific, the city of Baltimore circa 1963) after serving time on the Steven Spielberg assembly line (in 'Young Sherlock Holmes'). The idea of a film depicting the cutthroat antagonism between two aluminum siding salesmen must have been alarming to the people at Touchstone Pictures, who no doubt insisted on certain commercial concessions, including a strictly gratuitous appearance by the pop group Fine Young Cannibals (out of place in the early '60s setting), and the casting of two high-profile names in the title roles (an allusion to the heartless hero of Oz). Danny DeVito and Richard Dreyfuss portray the disreputable rival salesmen who become mortal enemies after a minor fender bender dings their new Cadillacs. Both are reliable comic talents, but the highlights of the film are the lengthy digressions from the plot, with a (largely unknown) cast of supporting actors improvising loopy, crisscrossing conversation over coffee and donuts. Despite the effort Levinson may have put into his screenplay it's the unscripted banter that leaves the best impression, winning points for unpredictability in an original but otherwise uneven comedy.

    Tin Men (Barry Levinson, 1987) is a nifty examination of the American Dream, focusing on a pair of aluminum-siding salesmen in early-'60s Baltimore who engage in an escalating campaign of retribution after their Cadillacs collide. Richard Dreyfuss is a sharp-shooting huckster in a powder blue suit, Danny DeVito a down-on-his-luck nighthawk trying to stay in the game. Just as they rely on sheen and trickery to flog their wares, so the film inveigles its way in with a succession of comic episodes, before revealing itself as an incisive take on the artifice of materialism and machismo - and a compelling character piece. It flirts with the hustlers' romanticised image of themselves, but also shows the reality: they're just a bunch of fraudsters, flogging the American Dream. Tin Men is a subtle, masterfully-crafted little film, boosted by strong performances from the leads (rough edges and fluffed lines intact), nice supporting turns - including Barbara Hershey as DeVito's put-upon wife - and writer-director Barry Levinson's terrific ear for dialogue. His script is realistic but finely-honed and, years before Tarantino provided his own post-modern take on eatery conversation (and some five years after Levinson's own Diner), offers several servings of pop-culture-savvy squabbling that complement the movie's more ambitious elements. There's one excellent exchange in which DeVito tells his friends he'd never seen Dreyfuss before the crash, only to find that pal Stanley Brock won't let it lie. "You musta seen him. He hangs out with Carly Benelli, Cheese... you know, that group," he says. "Don't you remember, he was up at the Corral one night when we there... he's a good dancer. You must have seen him." Eventually DeVito tires of being told what slick moves his adversary has, retorting: "What do you want me to do, date him? What do I give a (expletive deleted) if he's a good dancer?" "I tell you, if I was a girl I would be very impressed," Brock replies. "You're not a girl and you're impressed," counters friend Jackie Gayle. Another of the film's strengths lies in its original plotting: it's almost impossible to second-guess where the story is heading, particularly in the first half. While the next hour does offer some concessions to conventionality, they're entirely in keeping with the characters' shifting mind-sets, and there's generally another trick or two up Levinson's apparently bottomless sleeve. The subplot about the Maryland Home Improvement Commission clamping down on bad practice is perfect. That's not to say the film doesn't have flaws - there are occasional lulls, and a bit more context wouldn't go amiss - but that it's welcome to find a movie so assured in its value, intelligence and razor-sharp sense of humour that the director lets you discover its qualities for yourself. A movie so well-handled that even the way busted scammers hand in their licenses is a snapshot of their characters. Levinson also makes a neat job of paraphrasing the era, with simple but effective production design, smart credits and a first-rate song score by '60s-soundalikes Fine Young Cannibals. What starts off as a lively story of obsession and revenge - a funny spin on The Duellists, if you will - ultimately ends up as something more intriguing, durable and worthwhile. And the draft drawings of my revamped house look just about good enough for Life Magazine. I'm covering the place in siding.

    Dreyfus vs Louis: Levinson's Entertaining Study of Baltimore Sales Scammers

    If you really want to find the essence of American urban life in the 1950's and 1960's, just spend a few hours at either an east-coast diner or in a 1960 Cadillac. Sometimes I think Barry Levinson must have owned a Cadillac and driven to diners where he overheard dialog which he scribbled into a notebook. (His first movie was of course called "Diner".) Levinson has captured the atmosphere of the era through his realistic dialog that seems lifted straight from the dirty tables and dry pancakes. A bunch of friends eating at a diner and yapping about TV shows and broads is what real east-coast urban American life is all about. And when these guys are not drinking coffee and dividing up the check, they're driving their Cadillacs to potential customers to sell aluminum siding. This is the second of Levinson's Baltimore trilogy. The term "tin men" referred to aluminum siding salesmen who were just a cut under car salesmen and just above con artists. In the 1950's and 1960's when competition tightened, some of these salesmen used seemingly innocent but deceptive tactics on a very naive and trusting public who have since gotten very wise to this kind of manipulation. These hard-sell approaches included bate and switch, falsely promising free extras, and fabricating associations with nationwide magazines. Barry Levinson thrusts us into the middle of a rivalry between two of the more devious of aluminum siding salesmen, played by two of the most nervous-angst actors in the business: Danny DeVito and Richard Dreyfus. The casting of these two against each other has to have been from heaven. The smart-alec Dreyfus versus the self-centered DeVito makes for a clash of the urban sales titans early 1960's style. DeVito and Dreyfus literally "run into each other" and begin a heated game of oneupmanship that at first involves their cars and then DeVito's wife played with subtle realism by Barbara Hershey. (Of course the biggest mystery of the film is how Hershey ended up with DeVito in the first place but that could be the subject of a PhD dissertation.) The cars owned by the salesmen are important enough to also be characters. This game of king of the hill is at the forefront of the shady practices enacted by the tin men to get customers. Some of the most interesting aspects of the film are the games they play to make sales. Their customers are often very simple and trusting folk who don't realize they are being taken by sharks. But looming in the background is the US Housing Commission who are starting to become wise to their practices. A very enjoyable film overall, completely unpredictable, with fantastic performances by the three leads DeVito, Dreyfus, and Hershey. Of course, would you buy anything from these guys? I'm sure you never thought your house could use some aluminum siding.

    These days we seem to have increasing numbers of movies with special fx and huge budgets but poorly drawn characters and plots. Tin Men is one of my favourite movies for 6 reasons: 1 It's set in a small world inhabited by Aluminium siding salesmen trying to sell cladding to cover up the characteristic Baltimore brick Clook and with the backdrop of a 'Home Improvement Commission' set to break all of the salesmen's scams. The scams and backdrop are really amusing. 2 The backdrop allows some real characters to shine - hopes and fears, they're very believable recognisable characters. And rounded characters. And the movie is full of fantastic cameos. 3 The plot is fantastic. It has a beginning, middle and end, and the it builds and is finely structured with the hints of what is going to happen woven in a carefully constructed progression. It has an economical structure with some believable and clear plot twists. Fantastic writing and editing. 4 The actors and setting are bullet proof. 1963 Baltimore is perfect and Richard Dreyfus, Danny deVito, and Barbara Hershey as the leads are perfection. 5 The sound track is just great. I hate most of this sort of music cold but it is an integral part of the plot. The Fine Young Cannibals, heading by the unmistakable voice of Roland Gift singing 'Good Thing' is also brilliant. Things to watch - when Tilly (deVito) has made what he thinks is his comeback sale and they go to the bar and FTC are singing,- the atmosphere shots in the bar of all the punters is one of my favourite movie moments. - When Sam describes finding God at the smorgasboard and then later when Tilly tries to have his own spirtual experience at a smorgasboard. - The sales scene near the beginning of the film where we learn about the industry - the growing feud between the two main protagonists - Tilly appearing before the commission - the diner lunches that Tilly's team have when they keep going on about TV (Bonanza and other shows). I think this is Barry Levinson's best work.

    I think it is among the best movies i've ever seen. It gives me somehow a good feeling every time i watch it. The life of the two characters played by Danny DeVito and Richard Dreyfuss could be the life of any of us. It makes the movie smell like real life. It is a simple story about a simple life of some "special" tin agents struggling for survival in a non friendly political environment. They only want to sell their product. They have many tricks to do that. The two characters are in the same industry but they have turned against each other because of a simple and minor car accident. As the story develops we can look into the life of the two characters. See their friends, their family their problems their happiness. We don't know who is the good guy and who is the bad one. The point is, after the movie we just simple start loving both of the characters just because they are as human as just any of us. There is no action, blood and sex in this movie just the story of some ordinary people but with so much humor, love and sense that you can't miss it!

    I saw this when it first came out, and I said to everyone- "this has one of the best soundtracks I have heard in a long while". I kept telling everyone that the song in the background-which is of course, "Good Thing" when Dreyfuss is kind of jigging thru the bar, was a great song, with a very catchy melody. So, I was not surprised at all, when the Fine Young Cannibals CD, "The Raw and the Cooked" released after this film- went all the way to the top (it contained 2 songs from this film) That said, I LOVE the storyline, the acting, Richard Dreyfuss is adorable, looks wise and character wise. I loved him in "The Goodbye Girl" but LOVED him in this! The funniest scene in my opinion involves Danny DeVito, at the buffet, I will not spoil it-but I thought it was hysterical! Barbara Hershey BEFORE she had collagen lips-is charming too. Highly recommend and I want this in my DVD collection!!!

    Who would have thought that the frantic Bellboy in Mel Brooks' High Anxiety could write and direct a script of this subtlety? Being in 3 Mel Brooks films thankfully did not seem to affect him. This film is a 9 if not a 10, and repays repeated viewing , for the script,the direction,and the acting (everyone is superb,but Dreyfuss, Hershey,and DeVito are absolutely terrific).The period setting,as far as I can tell,is spot on. The reference to a future VW dealership for BB/Tilley,referred to in other comments(hinted at twice in the film) seems to miss the 'Golden Arch' that fills the final frame. The future might have been burgers as well as beetles! High Anxiety, on the other hand,represented the beginning of the end for Mel Brooks after the brilliance of The Producers,Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein.The only good thing in any otherwise VERY boring High Anxiety is Mel Brooks' hilarious impersonation of Frank Sinatra singing the title song.The rest is a very laboured and dire parody of Hitchcock, where Young Frankenstein was fresh and sustained parody of James Whale's films.
