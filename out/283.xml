    I can't find any more ways to say the word cute while taking notes during the film, because that's Emma in a nutshell. It's a petite, innocent, and simplistic movie that is sure to keep you involved in the story. It features some wonderful dialogue in Jane Austen's novel. It's a nicely composed film, even if the music is not utilized at time as it should be. Gwyneth Paltrow's performance shines like the champagne she drinks in the film, in a breakout role any actress would die for. Paltrow is ever-so-charming as the title character, and puts forth the effort to make this a memorable film and role. Emma is the type of film you'll love watching, it's even appropriate for children, the problem with it is that the fluff is light enough to carry the film into the family genre. There's no depth or artist storytelling, behind the film's green glass, clear water, long candlesticks, opulent furniture, exquisite flowers and classy decor. It does play off some classic fables, but never stomps on any new ground. It's just an amusing time. Emma is a delightful film, that's cute and fluffy with some fantastic visuals and a sparkling leading performance from Gwyneth Paltrow. Rating: 7/10; Grade: B+

    This is a beautifully filmed movie with a well cast group of actors. The countryside and interiors lovely English houses are picture perfect from a storybook painting. Gwyneth Paltrow looks lovely in the period costumes and acts charmingly. Her English accent is fine. Her supporting cast is well chosen. Toni Collette especially is cute and plump as Harriett. Ewan McGregor, Alan Cumming and Greta Scacchi are all quite suited to their roles too. It's still very funny and the complicated story is well told here. Nice to watch Clueless with Alicia Silverstone to see how a modern version of this story still works nearly 200 years later. After watching this version, the later television versions are redundant. Along with Pride and Prejudice starring Keira Knightley and Sense and Sensibility starring Kate Winslet this is the best movie version of Austen.

    This film just does not end. I know this film doesn't appeal to my tastes, but I've seen other dramas that set out to be historical fiction that are far more entertaining and far less clich&eacute; than this. The performances are incredibly dull and wooden, and I don't care if Paltrow is the leading lady. She is an unlikeable character, who is most meddlesome and a simpleton. The rest of the supporting cast is clich&eacute; and poorly written as well, earning no high remarks. Even Ewan McGregor fails to impress. Oh, and the script. It makes me cringe. The story and plot is essentially nonexistent, and each scene is entirely too predictable. Even the soundtrack (which was nominated for an Academy Award) is so uninspired and is nothing simple regal score that grows more boring as the film progresses. The only plus are the sets; they are all fairly fantastic and filled with a lot of detail. With such great sets you would think that they would have better cinematography, but this film looks like it was shot by students straight out of film school. So aside from looking past the characters, "plot", and writing to appreciate the scenery, I can't stand this film. It's too clich&eacute;, too regal, and too predictable to be entertaining or interesting. I may be stepping on some people's toes, so I apologize. But for me this film just doesn't cut it and is, simply, a lazy effort and an annoying adaptation of a famed novel.

    Emma is one of the most challenging movies to review, because of how average it is. No outstanding qualities, and many flaws, none of them completely horrible. It's certainly watchable, but it's a very shallow experience, so unmemorable as to add to the challenge of writing a review, mere days after watching it. I haven't read the novel, so I don't know if the movie faithfully follows its plot. The setting is the early 19th century, and focuses on the high society of a small town. There, Hariet Smith, is enamoured with a farmer and her friend Emma considers he is not a suitable match for her. So she dedicates a great deal of her time in finding her a better (in her opinion), more high-class fianc&eacute;. All the while, several men are revolving around her as well, but she gives them only superficial thought, concentrated as she is on making plans for Harriet. It never really gets further or deeper than that. The inevitable happy end is at once predictable and untimely, falling out of the blue. The acting is too stiff and full of simper, even for a story supposed to happen 200 years ago in the English upper-class. Nor Gwyneth Paltrow, nor any of the actors for that matter, manage to make the viewers relate to the characters. When all the actors give such a bad performance, I suppose the true culprit is director Douglas McGrath. Still, despite all its flaws, there is some charm to be found if one makes the effort to take this piece with a light mind. Perhaps it's the nice English country landscapes. Perhaps the old-fashioned affected languageÂ… Because of this, it's not hard to let yourself carry to the end of this otherwise slightly boring, mostly forgettable movie.

    This is a pure "bagatelle", but very charming, entertaining and heart-warming. I loved the beautiful photo of the typical English dream-idyll: the thatched cottages in their tiny gardens, the great mansions, the ball-room dancing, all the beautiful clothes and hairdos... from a time when men were allowed to be men, and women were allowed to be women. There was even a nice vicar and a geese shepherdess in a bonnet to make it complete..! :-) Of course one could argue that these people were a small, fortunate minority, who could devote so much of their time and energy to social life, entertaining, match-making and affairs of the heart. In a time when the majority were poor, sometimes very poor, and only seldom could take any time off from their hard labour. One could also argue, that attractive unmarried gentlemen in their most virile age, and with the financial means to keep mistresses or visit prostitutes, probably were not this wholesome and innocent in reality... and probably not all ladies either. But today, on Twelfth Night, I preferred to try to forget about all that, and just enjoy the charming story and the beautiful pictures in the company of my 10-year old daughter! I recommend the movie to girls and women of all ages, and especially those who nourish a dream about Old English Romance..! :-) P.S. It was a long time since I read the novel, so I cannot say anything about if the movie was faithful to it or not. I have reviewed the movie as a separate work of art altogether.

    bitesizemoviereview dot blogspot dot com Though I have not read the Jane Austen novel, I thoroughly enjoyed this film adaption. For the most part, the acting was good and the sets were decent. Every now and then, a character would appear in a coat or a haircut that seemed out of place for the time period. Paltrow was well-suited for her role as Emma, a nosy but likable "matchmaker." The dances performed in the film seemed to be taken from A&E's Pride and Prejudice a year earlier--of course, the time period is relatively the same, but Emma would have been better off not using the exact same dance and musical score. Although the quality of this film is not top-notch, I enjoyed it for the witty acting and light romance plot.

    I am a fan of classic novels, and authors like Jane Austen and Bronte sisters hold a special place in my library. Jane Austen's novels have always been quite appeasing, but unfortunately the movie doesn't seem to do justice to the novel. After watching Gwyneth Paltrow in The Talented Mr. Ripley and Shakespeare in Love, I did expect the movie to be great. But turns out the other movie by the same name did much more justice to the novel than this one. Though the movie does follow the novel most of the time (I can recall only two scenes that don't exist in the novel), but the way things represent themselves in the novel, the movie hasn't been able to bring the characters to life. Except for the title character on whom the movie (or the novel) is based, the remaining characters have been badly undermined, thus lacking the humor of the novel. Watching movies is my passion as are the books and I often watch movies again, but this one won't be one the list for second watching. Thanks.

    Seeing this recently for the first time in 15 years, I was disappointed by its mediocrity. A talented cast is largely wasted, and among their number I do not include Paltrow, who hardly qualifies as talented on this evidence. Her stilted, mannered, plodding approach to her lines suggests that her energy was sapped by the effort of achieving an appropriate accent. However, this was clearly not a problem a few years later in Shakespeare in Love, and the faults of her performance here merely exemplify those of the production as a whole -- faults for which, one imagines, McGrath is largely to blame, though his Nicholas Nickleby a few years later shows that he too was capable of better. The movie is to be cherished for Juliet Stevenson's marvellous (though sadly truncated) turn as Mrs. Elton, but on the whole the film falls far short of the lively, sensitive, and above all natural, TV version of 2009, in which Christina Cole's Mrs Elton is only one of several outstanding performances.

    This is definitely the chocolate-box version of Emma. It focuses on all the comedic, light-hearted elements of the story over everything else. Quite a bit had to be cut for time, and the Frank Churchill/Jane Fairfax story suffered the most, I think. Still, most of the cast was good (with some exceptions!) and it's a fun romantic comedyÂ…even if it's not the best adaptation. I especially love Gwyneth Paltrow's Emma. Jeremy Northam is perhaps a bit too suave but still good as Mr. Knightley. The Eltons and Miss Bates were also great. Unfortunately Toni Collette was awful as Harriet Smith, as were Ewan McGregor as Frank Churchill (hideous wig) and Polly Walker as Jane Fairfax (too robust). This was a fun movie, but not quite Jane Austen's Emma. The Mr. Elton story was given a lot more focus over the Frank Churchill one. I think if I could change just one thing, I'd play up the Frank/Jane story more. Oh, and get rid of the ugly wig as well.

    Meddlesome though she may be, there is still something incredibly endearing about Emma Woodhouse. Her actions are all completely misguided and yet there is no doubt that she acts out of love. Emma Woodhouse lives in 19th century England, and according to her creator, Jane Austen, is "handsome, clever, and rich." She considers herself an expert matchmaker and spends her days planning elaborate liaisons for her friends. The results are always disastrous, for though Emma is convinced she knows what's best for everyone, she is oblivious of their true wants and desires, as well as her own. Her close friend Mr. Knightley watches with both amusement and dismay, for he can see clearly what Emma cannot. Yet being in love with her tries to guide her as best he can. Emma loves him too, but doesn't realize it until it is almost too late. When she discovers that her close friend Harriet Smith has also developed feelings for Mr. Knightley, and believes that he reciprocates, she suddenly realizes that she doesn't want to lose him. Fortunately for Emma, in the end he declares his true feelings to her and the two marry. So is it an ending that we agree with? Actually it is. We really love the relationship between Emma and the handsome and charming Mr. K - he is unflinchingly honest with her but never cruelly so. We love the scene in the park when he gives her a dressing down for her flippant treatment of poor Miss Bates; it clearly pains him to hurt her and yet he knows that it is the only way to maintain their friendship. And his proposal to her is another one of our favorite moments. Both are attractive and well off, and they share the same social circle. Both are happy people that genuinely care about their family and friends, and they both seem quite content in their little corner of the world. We think that they will have similar views about where and how to live, and how to raise their eventual family. Of course the Knightleys are long gone by now, but we feel quite safe in saying that their union was a happy and long-lasting one, filled with long talks, laughter, plenty of good arguments, and lots of little Knightleys. http://www.reel-couples.com/the-couple-emma-woodhouse-mr-knightley/ Reel Thing Rating: 5 out of 5 Reels

When she discovers that her close friend Harriet Smith has also developed feelings for Mr. Knightley, and believes that he reciprocates, she suddenly realizes that she doesn't want to lose him. Fortunately for Emma, in the end he declares his true feelings to her and the two marry. So is it an ending that we agree with? Actually it is. We really love the relationship between Emma and the handsome and charming Mr. K - he is unflinchingly honest with her but never cruelly so. We love the scene in the park when he gives her a dressing down for her flippant treatment of poor Miss Bates; it clearly pains him to hurt her and yet he knows that it is the only way to maintain their friendship. And his proposal to her is another one of our favorite moments. Both are attractive and well off, and they share the same social circle. Both are happy people that genuinely care about their family and friends, and they both seem quite content in their little corner of the world. We think that they will have similar views about where and how to live, and how to raise their eventual family. Of course the Knightleys are long gone by now, but we feel quite safe in saying that their union was a happy and long-lasting one, filled with long talks, laughter, plenty of good arguments, and lots of little Knightleys. http://www.reel-couples.com/the-couple-emma-woodhouse-mr-knightley/ Reel Thing Rating: 5 out of 5 Reels

    I can't find any more ways to say the word cute while taking notes during the film, because that's Emma in a nutshell. It's a petite, innocent, and simplistic movie that is sure to keep you involved in the story. It features some wonderful dialogue in Jane Austen's novel. It's a nicely composed film, even if the music is not utilized at time as it should be. Gwyneth Paltrow's performance shines like the champagne she drinks in the film, in a breakout role any actress would die for. Paltrow is ever-so-charming as the title character, and puts forth the effort to make this a memorable film and role. Emma is the type of film you'll love watching, it's even appropriate for children, the problem with it is that the fluff is light enough to carry the film into the family genre. There's no depth or artist storytelling, behind the film's green glass, clear water, long candlesticks, opulent furniture, exquisite flowers and classy decor. It does play off some classic fables, but never stomps on any new ground. It's just an amusing time. Emma is a delightful film, that's cute and fluffy with some fantastic visuals and a sparkling leading performance from Gwyneth Paltrow. Rating: 7/10; Grade: B+

    This is a beautifully filmed movie with a well cast group of actors. The countryside and interiors lovely English houses are picture perfect from a storybook painting. Gwyneth Paltrow looks lovely in the period costumes and acts charmingly. Her English accent is fine. Her supporting cast is well chosen. Toni Collette especially is cute and plump as Harriett. Ewan McGregor, Alan Cumming and Greta Scacchi are all quite suited to their roles too. It's still very funny and the complicated story is well told here. Nice to watch Clueless with Alicia Silverstone to see how a modern version of this story still works nearly 200 years later. After watching this version, the later television versions are redundant. Along with Pride and Prejudice starring Keira Knightley and Sense and Sensibility starring Kate Winslet this is the best movie version of Austen.

    This film just does not end. I know this film doesn't appeal to my tastes, but I've seen other dramas that set out to be historical fiction that are far more entertaining and far less clich&eacute; than this. The performances are incredibly dull and wooden, and I don't care if Paltrow is the leading lady. She is an unlikeable character, who is most meddlesome and a simpleton. The rest of the supporting cast is clich&eacute; and poorly written as well, earning no high remarks. Even Ewan McGregor fails to impress. Oh, and the script. It makes me cringe. The story and plot is essentially nonexistent, and each scene is entirely too predictable. Even the soundtrack (which was nominated for an Academy Award) is so uninspired and is nothing simple regal score that grows more boring as the film progresses. The only plus are the sets; they are all fairly fantastic and filled with a lot of detail. With such great sets you would think that they would have better cinematography, but this film looks like it was shot by students straight out of film school. So aside from looking past the characters, "plot", and writing to appreciate the scenery, I can't stand this film. It's too clich&eacute;, too regal, and too predictable to be entertaining or interesting. I may be stepping on some people's toes, so I apologize. But for me this film just doesn't cut it and is, simply, a lazy effort and an annoying adaptation of a famed novel.

    Emma is one of the most challenging movies to review, because of how average it is. No outstanding qualities, and many flaws, none of them completely horrible. It's certainly watchable, but it's a very shallow experience, so unmemorable as to add to the challenge of writing a review, mere days after watching it. I haven't read the novel, so I don't know if the movie faithfully follows its plot. The setting is the early 19th century, and focuses on the high society of a small town. There, Hariet Smith, is enamoured with a farmer and her friend Emma considers he is not a suitable match for her. So she dedicates a great deal of her time in finding her a better (in her opinion), more high-class fianc&eacute;. All the while, several men are revolving around her as well, but she gives them only superficial thought, concentrated as she is on making plans for Harriet. It never really gets further or deeper than that. The inevitable happy end is at once predictable and untimely, falling out of the blue. The acting is too stiff and full of simper, even for a story supposed to happen 200 years ago in the English upper-class. Nor Gwyneth Paltrow, nor any of the actors for that matter, manage to make the viewers relate to the characters. When all the actors give such a bad performance, I suppose the true culprit is director Douglas McGrath. Still, despite all its flaws, there is some charm to be found if one makes the effort to take this piece with a light mind. Perhaps it's the nice English country landscapes. Perhaps the old-fashioned affected languageÂ… Because of this, it's not hard to let yourself carry to the end of this otherwise slightly boring, mostly forgettable movie.

    This is a pure "bagatelle", but very charming, entertaining and heart-warming. I loved the beautiful photo of the typical English dream-idyll: the thatched cottages in their tiny gardens, the great mansions, the ball-room dancing, all the beautiful clothes and hairdos... from a time when men were allowed to be men, and women were allowed to be women. There was even a nice vicar and a geese shepherdess in a bonnet to make it complete..! :-) Of course one could argue that these people were a small, fortunate minority, who could devote so much of their time and energy to social life, entertaining, match-making and affairs of the heart. In a time when the majority were poor, sometimes very poor, and only seldom could take any time off from their hard labour. One could also argue, that attractive unmarried gentlemen in their most virile age, and with the financial means to keep mistresses or visit prostitutes, probably were not this wholesome and innocent in reality... and probably not all ladies either. But today, on Twelfth Night, I preferred to try to forget about all that, and just enjoy the charming story and the beautiful pictures in the company of my 10-year old daughter! I recommend the movie to girls and women of all ages, and especially those who nourish a dream about Old English Romance..! :-) P.S. It was a long time since I read the novel, so I cannot say anything about if the movie was faithful to it or not. I have reviewed the movie as a separate work of art altogether.

    bitesizemoviereview dot blogspot dot com Though I have not read the Jane Austen novel, I thoroughly enjoyed this film adaption. For the most part, the acting was good and the sets were decent. Every now and then, a character would appear in a coat or a haircut that seemed out of place for the time period. Paltrow was well-suited for her role as Emma, a nosy but likable "matchmaker." The dances performed in the film seemed to be taken from A&E's Pride and Prejudice a year earlier--of course, the time period is relatively the same, but Emma would have been better off not using the exact same dance and musical score. Although the quality of this film is not top-notch, I enjoyed it for the witty acting and light romance plot.

    I am a fan of classic novels, and authors like Jane Austen and Bronte sisters hold a special place in my library. Jane Austen's novels have always been quite appeasing, but unfortunately the movie doesn't seem to do justice to the novel. After watching Gwyneth Paltrow in The Talented Mr. Ripley and Shakespeare in Love, I did expect the movie to be great. But turns out the other movie by the same name did much more justice to the novel than this one. Though the movie does follow the novel most of the time (I can recall only two scenes that don't exist in the novel), but the way things represent themselves in the novel, the movie hasn't been able to bring the characters to life. Except for the title character on whom the movie (or the novel) is based, the remaining characters have been badly undermined, thus lacking the humor of the novel. Watching movies is my passion as are the books and I often watch movies again, but this one won't be one the list for second watching. Thanks.

    Seeing this recently for the first time in 15 years, I was disappointed by its mediocrity. A talented cast is largely wasted, and among their number I do not include Paltrow, who hardly qualifies as talented on this evidence. Her stilted, mannered, plodding approach to her lines suggests that her energy was sapped by the effort of achieving an appropriate accent. However, this was clearly not a problem a few years later in Shakespeare in Love, and the faults of her performance here merely exemplify those of the production as a whole -- faults for which, one imagines, McGrath is largely to blame, though his Nicholas Nickleby a few years later shows that he too was capable of better. The movie is to be cherished for Juliet Stevenson's marvellous (though sadly truncated) turn as Mrs. Elton, but on the whole the film falls far short of the lively, sensitive, and above all natural, TV version of 2009, in which Christina Cole's Mrs Elton is only one of several outstanding performances.

    This is definitely the chocolate-box version of Emma. It focuses on all the comedic, light-hearted elements of the story over everything else. Quite a bit had to be cut for time, and the Frank Churchill/Jane Fairfax story suffered the most, I think. Still, most of the cast was good (with some exceptions!) and it's a fun romantic comedyÂ…even if it's not the best adaptation. I especially love Gwyneth Paltrow's Emma. Jeremy Northam is perhaps a bit too suave but still good as Mr. Knightley. The Eltons and Miss Bates were also great. Unfortunately Toni Collette was awful as Harriet Smith, as were Ewan McGregor as Frank Churchill (hideous wig) and Polly Walker as Jane Fairfax (too robust). This was a fun movie, but not quite Jane Austen's Emma. The Mr. Elton story was given a lot more focus over the Frank Churchill one. I think if I could change just one thing, I'd play up the Frank/Jane story more. Oh, and get rid of the ugly wig as well.

    Meddlesome though she may be, there is still something incredibly endearing about Emma Woodhouse. Her actions are all completely misguided and yet there is no doubt that she acts out of love. Emma Woodhouse lives in 19th century England, and according to her creator, Jane Austen, is "handsome, clever, and rich." She considers herself an expert matchmaker and spends her days planning elaborate liaisons for her friends. The results are always disastrous, for though Emma is convinced she knows what's best for everyone, she is oblivious of their true wants and desires, as well as her own. Her close friend Mr. Knightley watches with both amusement and dismay, for he can see clearly what Emma cannot. Yet being in love with her tries to guide her as best he can. Emma loves him too, but doesn't realize it until it is almost too late. When she discovers that her close friend Harriet Smith has also developed feelings for Mr. Knightley, and believes that he reciprocates, she suddenly realizes that she doesn't want to lose him.

We love the scene in the park when he gives her a dressing down for her flippant treatment of poor Miss Bates; it clearly pains him to hurt her and yet he knows that it is the only way to maintain their friendship. And his proposal to her is another one of our favorite moments. Both are attractive and well off, and they share the same social circle. Both are happy people that genuinely care about their family and friends, and they both seem quite content in their little corner of the world. We think that they will have similar views about where and how to live, and how to raise their eventual family. Of course the Knightleys are long gone by now, but we feel quite safe in saying that their union was a happy and long-lasting one, filled with long talks, laughter, plenty of good arguments, and lots of little Knightleys. http://www.reel-couples.com/the-couple-emma-woodhouse-mr-knightley/ Reel Thing Rating: 5 out of 5 Reels

    I can't find any more ways to say the word cute while taking notes during the film, because that's Emma in a nutshell. It's a petite, innocent, and simplistic movie that is sure to keep you involved in the story. It features some wonderful dialogue in Jane Austen's novel. It's a nicely composed film, even if the music is not utilized at time as it should be. Gwyneth Paltrow's performance shines like the champagne she drinks in the film, in a breakout role any actress would die for. Paltrow is ever-so-charming as the title character, and puts forth the effort to make this a memorable film and role. Emma is the type of film you'll love watching, it's even appropriate for children, the problem with it is that the fluff is light enough to carry the film into the family genre. There's no depth or artist storytelling, behind the film's green glass, clear water, long candlesticks, opulent furniture, exquisite flowers and classy decor. It does play off some classic fables, but never stomps on any new ground. It's just an amusing time. Emma is a delightful film, that's cute and fluffy with some fantastic visuals and a sparkling leading performance from Gwyneth Paltrow. Rating: 7/10; Grade: B+

    This is a beautifully filmed movie with a well cast group of actors. The countryside and interiors lovely English houses are picture perfect from a storybook painting. Gwyneth Paltrow looks lovely in the period costumes and acts charmingly. Her English accent is fine. Her supporting cast is well chosen. Toni Collette especially is cute and plump as Harriett. Ewan McGregor, Alan Cumming and Greta Scacchi are all quite suited to their roles too. It's still very funny and the complicated story is well told here. Nice to watch Clueless with Alicia Silverstone to see how a modern version of this story still works nearly 200 years later. After watching this version, the later television versions are redundant. Along with Pride and Prejudice starring Keira Knightley and Sense and Sensibility starring Kate Winslet this is the best movie version of Austen.

    This film just does not end. I know this film doesn't appeal to my tastes, but I've seen other dramas that set out to be historical fiction that are far more entertaining and far less clich&eacute; than this. The performances are incredibly dull and wooden, and I don't care if Paltrow is the leading lady. She is an unlikeable character, who is most meddlesome and a simpleton. The rest of the supporting cast is clich&eacute; and poorly written as well, earning no high remarks. Even Ewan McGregor fails to impress. Oh, and the script. It makes me cringe. The story and plot is essentially nonexistent, and each scene is entirely too predictable. Even the soundtrack (which was nominated for an Academy Award) is so uninspired and is nothing simple regal score that grows more boring as the film progresses. The only plus are the sets; they are all fairly fantastic and filled with a lot of detail. With such great sets you would think that they would have better cinematography, but this film looks like it was shot by students straight out of film school. So aside from looking past the characters, "plot", and writing to appreciate the scenery, I can't stand this film. It's too clich&eacute;, too regal, and too predictable to be entertaining or interesting. I may be stepping on some people's toes, so I apologize. But for me this film just doesn't cut it and is, simply, a lazy effort and an annoying adaptation of a famed novel.

    Emma is one of the most challenging movies to review, because of how average it is. No outstanding qualities, and many flaws, none of them completely horrible. It's certainly watchable, but it's a very shallow experience, so unmemorable as to add to the challenge of writing a review, mere days after watching it. I haven't read the novel, so I don't know if the movie faithfully follows its plot. The setting is the early 19th century, and focuses on the high society of a small town. There, Hariet Smith, is enamoured with a farmer and her friend Emma considers he is not a suitable match for her. So she dedicates a great deal of her time in finding her a better (in her opinion), more high-class fianc&eacute;. All the while, several men are revolving around her as well, but she gives them only superficial thought, concentrated as she is on making plans for Harriet. It never really gets further or deeper than that. The inevitable happy end is at once predictable and untimely, falling out of the blue. The acting is too stiff and full of simper, even for a story supposed to happen 200 years ago in the English upper-class. Nor Gwyneth Paltrow, nor any of the actors for that matter, manage to make the viewers relate to the characters. When all the actors give such a bad performance, I suppose the true culprit is director Douglas McGrath. Still, despite all its flaws, there is some charm to be found if one makes the effort to take this piece with a light mind. Perhaps it's the nice English country landscapes. Perhaps the old-fashioned affected languageÂ… Because of this, it's not hard to let yourself carry to the end of this otherwise slightly boring, mostly forgettable movie.

    This is a pure "bagatelle", but very charming, entertaining and heart-warming. I loved the beautiful photo of the typical English dream-idyll: the thatched cottages in their tiny gardens, the great mansions, the ball-room dancing, all the beautiful clothes and hairdos... from a time when men were allowed to be men, and women were allowed to be women. There was even a nice vicar and a geese shepherdess in a bonnet to make it complete..! :-) Of course one could argue that these people were a small, fortunate minority, who could devote so much of their time and energy to social life, entertaining, match-making and affairs of the heart. In a time when the majority were poor, sometimes very poor, and only seldom could take any time off from their hard labour. One could also argue, that attractive unmarried gentlemen in their most virile age, and with the financial means to keep mistresses or visit prostitutes, probably were not this wholesome and innocent in reality... and probably not all ladies either. But today, on Twelfth Night, I preferred to try to forget about all that, and just enjoy the charming story and the beautiful pictures in the company of my 10-year old daughter! I recommend the movie to girls and women of all ages, and especially those who nourish a dream about Old English Romance..! :-) P.S. It was a long time since I read the novel, so I cannot say anything about if the movie was faithful to it or not. I have reviewed the movie as a separate work of art altogether.

    bitesizemoviereview dot blogspot dot com Though I have not read the Jane Austen novel, I thoroughly enjoyed this film adaption. For the most part, the acting was good and the sets were decent. Every now and then, a character would appear in a coat or a haircut that seemed out of place for the time period. Paltrow was well-suited for her role as Emma, a nosy but likable "matchmaker." The dances performed in the film seemed to be taken from A&E's Pride and Prejudice a year earlier--of course, the time period is relatively the same, but Emma would have been better off not using the exact same dance and musical score. Although the quality of this film is not top-notch, I enjoyed it for the witty acting and light romance plot.

    I am a fan of classic novels, and authors like Jane Austen and Bronte sisters hold a special place in my library. Jane Austen's novels have always been quite appeasing, but unfortunately the movie doesn't seem to do justice to the novel. After watching Gwyneth Paltrow in The Talented Mr. Ripley and Shakespeare in Love, I did expect the movie to be great. But turns out the other movie by the same name did much more justice to the novel than this one. Though the movie does follow the novel most of the time (I can recall only two scenes that don't exist in the novel), but the way things represent themselves in the novel, the movie hasn't been able to bring the characters to life. Except for the title character on whom the movie (or the novel) is based, the remaining characters have been badly undermined, thus lacking the humor of the novel. Watching movies is my passion as are the books and I often watch movies again, but this one won't be one the list for second watching. Thanks.

    Seeing this recently for the first time in 15 years, I was disappointed by its mediocrity. A talented cast is largely wasted, and among their number I do not include Paltrow, who hardly qualifies as talented on this evidence. Her stilted, mannered, plodding approach to her lines suggests that her energy was sapped by the effort of achieving an appropriate accent. However, this was clearly not a problem a few years later in Shakespeare in Love, and the faults of her performance here merely exemplify those of the production as a whole -- faults for which, one imagines, McGrath is largely to blame, though his Nicholas Nickleby a few years later shows that he too was capable of better. The movie is to be cherished for Juliet Stevenson's marvellous (though sadly truncated) turn as Mrs. Elton, but on the whole the film falls far short of the lively, sensitive, and above all natural, TV version of 2009, in which Christina Cole's Mrs Elton is only one of several outstanding performances.

    This is definitely the chocolate-box version of Emma. It focuses on all the comedic, light-hearted elements of the story over everything else. Quite a bit had to be cut for time, and the Frank Churchill/Jane Fairfax story suffered the most, I think. Still, most of the cast was good (with some exceptions!) and it's a fun romantic comedyÂ…even if it's not the best adaptation. I especially love Gwyneth Paltrow's Emma. Jeremy Northam is perhaps a bit too suave but still good as Mr. Knightley. The Eltons and Miss Bates were also great. Unfortunately Toni Collette was awful as Harriet Smith, as were Ewan McGregor as Frank Churchill (hideous wig) and Polly Walker as Jane Fairfax (too robust). This was a fun movie, but not quite Jane Austen's Emma. The Mr. Elton story was given a lot more focus over the Frank Churchill one. I think if I could change just one thing, I'd play up the Frank/Jane story more. Oh, and get rid of the ugly wig as well.

    Meddlesome though she may be, there is still something incredibly endearing about Emma Woodhouse. Her actions are all completely misguided and yet there is no doubt that she acts out of love. Emma Woodhouse lives in 19th century England, and according to her creator, Jane Austen, is "handsome, clever, and rich." She considers herself an expert matchmaker and spends her days planning elaborate liaisons for her friends. The results are always disastrous, for though Emma is convinced she knows what's best for everyone, she is oblivious of their true wants and desires, as well as her own. Her close friend Mr. Knightley watches with both amusement and dismay, for he can see clearly what Emma cannot. Yet being in love with her tries to guide her as best he can. Emma loves him too, but doesn't realize it until it is almost too late. When she discovers that her close friend Harriet Smith has also developed feelings for Mr. Knightley, and believes that he reciprocates, she suddenly realizes that she doesn't want to lose him. Fortunately for Emma, in the end he declares his true feelings to her and the two marry. So is it an ending that we agree with? Actually it is. We really love the relationship between Emma and the handsome and charming Mr. K - he is unflinchingly honest with her but never cruelly so.

Of course the Knightleys are long gone by now, but we feel quite safe in saying that their union was a happy and long-lasting one, filled with long talks, laughter, plenty of good arguments, and lots of little Knightleys. http://www.reel-couples.com/the-couple-emma-woodhouse-mr-knightley/ Reel Thing Rating: 5 out of 5 Reels

    I can't find any more ways to say the word cute while taking notes during the film, because that's Emma in a nutshell. It's a petite, innocent, and simplistic movie that is sure to keep you involved in the story. It features some wonderful dialogue in Jane Austen's novel. It's a nicely composed film, even if the music is not utilized at time as it should be. Gwyneth Paltrow's performance shines like the champagne she drinks in the film, in a breakout role any actress would die for. Paltrow is ever-so-charming as the title character, and puts forth the effort to make this a memorable film and role. Emma is the type of film you'll love watching, it's even appropriate for children, the problem with it is that the fluff is light enough to carry the film into the family genre. There's no depth or artist storytelling, behind the film's green glass, clear water, long candlesticks, opulent furniture, exquisite flowers and classy decor. It does play off some classic fables, but never stomps on any new ground. It's just an amusing time. Emma is a delightful film, that's cute and fluffy with some fantastic visuals and a sparkling leading performance from Gwyneth Paltrow. Rating: 7/10; Grade: B+

    This is a beautifully filmed movie with a well cast group of actors. The countryside and interiors lovely English houses are picture perfect from a storybook painting. Gwyneth Paltrow looks lovely in the period costumes and acts charmingly. Her English accent is fine. Her supporting cast is well chosen. Toni Collette especially is cute and plump as Harriett. Ewan McGregor, Alan Cumming and Greta Scacchi are all quite suited to their roles too. It's still very funny and the complicated story is well told here. Nice to watch Clueless with Alicia Silverstone to see how a modern version of this story still works nearly 200 years later. After watching this version, the later television versions are redundant. Along with Pride and Prejudice starring Keira Knightley and Sense and Sensibility starring Kate Winslet this is the best movie version of Austen.

    This film just does not end. I know this film doesn't appeal to my tastes, but I've seen other dramas that set out to be historical fiction that are far more entertaining and far less clich&eacute; than this. The performances are incredibly dull and wooden, and I don't care if Paltrow is the leading lady. She is an unlikeable character, who is most meddlesome and a simpleton. The rest of the supporting cast is clich&eacute; and poorly written as well, earning no high remarks. Even Ewan McGregor fails to impress. Oh, and the script. It makes me cringe. The story and plot is essentially nonexistent, and each scene is entirely too predictable. Even the soundtrack (which was nominated for an Academy Award) is so uninspired and is nothing simple regal score that grows more boring as the film progresses. The only plus are the sets; they are all fairly fantastic and filled with a lot of detail. With such great sets you would think that they would have better cinematography, but this film looks like it was shot by students straight out of film school. So aside from looking past the characters, "plot", and writing to appreciate the scenery, I can't stand this film. It's too clich&eacute;, too regal, and too predictable to be entertaining or interesting. I may be stepping on some people's toes, so I apologize. But for me this film just doesn't cut it and is, simply, a lazy effort and an annoying adaptation of a famed novel.

    Emma is one of the most challenging movies to review, because of how average it is. No outstanding qualities, and many flaws, none of them completely horrible. It's certainly watchable, but it's a very shallow experience, so unmemorable as to add to the challenge of writing a review, mere days after watching it. I haven't read the novel, so I don't know if the movie faithfully follows its plot. The setting is the early 19th century, and focuses on the high society of a small town. There, Hariet Smith, is enamoured with a farmer and her friend Emma considers he is not a suitable match for her. So she dedicates a great deal of her time in finding her a better (in her opinion), more high-class fianc&eacute;. All the while, several men are revolving around her as well, but she gives them only superficial thought, concentrated as she is on making plans for Harriet. It never really gets further or deeper than that. The inevitable happy end is at once predictable and untimely, falling out of the blue. The acting is too stiff and full of simper, even for a story supposed to happen 200 years ago in the English upper-class. Nor Gwyneth Paltrow, nor any of the actors for that matter, manage to make the viewers relate to the characters. When all the actors give such a bad performance, I suppose the true culprit is director Douglas McGrath. Still, despite all its flaws, there is some charm to be found if one makes the effort to take this piece with a light mind. Perhaps it's the nice English country landscapes. Perhaps the old-fashioned affected languageÂ… Because of this, it's not hard to let yourself carry to the end of this otherwise slightly boring, mostly forgettable movie.

    This is a pure "bagatelle", but very charming, entertaining and heart-warming. I loved the beautiful photo of the typical English dream-idyll: the thatched cottages in their tiny gardens, the great mansions, the ball-room dancing, all the beautiful clothes and hairdos... from a time when men were allowed to be men, and women were allowed to be women. There was even a nice vicar and a geese shepherdess in a bonnet to make it complete..! :-) Of course one could argue that these people were a small, fortunate minority, who could devote so much of their time and energy to social life, entertaining, match-making and affairs of the heart. In a time when the majority were poor, sometimes very poor, and only seldom could take any time off from their hard labour. One could also argue, that attractive unmarried gentlemen in their most virile age, and with the financial means to keep mistresses or visit prostitutes, probably were not this wholesome and innocent in reality... and probably not all ladies either. But today, on Twelfth Night, I preferred to try to forget about all that, and just enjoy the charming story and the beautiful pictures in the company of my 10-year old daughter! I recommend the movie to girls and women of all ages, and especially those who nourish a dream about Old English Romance..! :-) P.S. It was a long time since I read the novel, so I cannot say anything about if the movie was faithful to it or not. I have reviewed the movie as a separate work of art altogether.

    bitesizemoviereview dot blogspot dot com Though I have not read the Jane Austen novel, I thoroughly enjoyed this film adaption. For the most part, the acting was good and the sets were decent. Every now and then, a character would appear in a coat or a haircut that seemed out of place for the time period. Paltrow was well-suited for her role as Emma, a nosy but likable "matchmaker." The dances performed in the film seemed to be taken from A&E's Pride and Prejudice a year earlier--of course, the time period is relatively the same, but Emma would have been better off not using the exact same dance and musical score. Although the quality of this film is not top-notch, I enjoyed it for the witty acting and light romance plot.

    I am a fan of classic novels, and authors like Jane Austen and Bronte sisters hold a special place in my library. Jane Austen's novels have always been quite appeasing, but unfortunately the movie doesn't seem to do justice to the novel. After watching Gwyneth Paltrow in The Talented Mr. Ripley and Shakespeare in Love, I did expect the movie to be great. But turns out the other movie by the same name did much more justice to the novel than this one. Though the movie does follow the novel most of the time (I can recall only two scenes that don't exist in the novel), but the way things represent themselves in the novel, the movie hasn't been able to bring the characters to life. Except for the title character on whom the movie (or the novel) is based, the remaining characters have been badly undermined, thus lacking the humor of the novel. Watching movies is my passion as are the books and I often watch movies again, but this one won't be one the list for second watching. Thanks.

    Seeing this recently for the first time in 15 years, I was disappointed by its mediocrity. A talented cast is largely wasted, and among their number I do not include Paltrow, who hardly qualifies as talented on this evidence. Her stilted, mannered, plodding approach to her lines suggests that her energy was sapped by the effort of achieving an appropriate accent. However, this was clearly not a problem a few years later in Shakespeare in Love, and the faults of her performance here merely exemplify those of the production as a whole -- faults for which, one imagines, McGrath is largely to blame, though his Nicholas Nickleby a few years later shows that he too was capable of better. The movie is to be cherished for Juliet Stevenson's marvellous (though sadly truncated) turn as Mrs. Elton, but on the whole the film falls far short of the lively, sensitive, and above all natural, TV version of 2009, in which Christina Cole's Mrs Elton is only one of several outstanding performances.

    This is definitely the chocolate-box version of Emma. It focuses on all the comedic, light-hearted elements of the story over everything else. Quite a bit had to be cut for time, and the Frank Churchill/Jane Fairfax story suffered the most, I think. Still, most of the cast was good (with some exceptions!) and it's a fun romantic comedyÂ…even if it's not the best adaptation. I especially love Gwyneth Paltrow's Emma. Jeremy Northam is perhaps a bit too suave but still good as Mr. Knightley. The Eltons and Miss Bates were also great. Unfortunately Toni Collette was awful as Harriet Smith, as were Ewan McGregor as Frank Churchill (hideous wig) and Polly Walker as Jane Fairfax (too robust). This was a fun movie, but not quite Jane Austen's Emma. The Mr. Elton story was given a lot more focus over the Frank Churchill one. I think if I could change just one thing, I'd play up the Frank/Jane story more. Oh, and get rid of the ugly wig as well.

    Meddlesome though she may be, there is still something incredibly endearing about Emma Woodhouse. Her actions are all completely misguided and yet there is no doubt that she acts out of love. Emma Woodhouse lives in 19th century England, and according to her creator, Jane Austen, is "handsome, clever, and rich." She considers herself an expert matchmaker and spends her days planning elaborate liaisons for her friends. The results are always disastrous, for though Emma is convinced she knows what's best for everyone, she is oblivious of their true wants and desires, as well as her own. Her close friend Mr. Knightley watches with both amusement and dismay, for he can see clearly what Emma cannot. Yet being in love with her tries to guide her as best he can. Emma loves him too, but doesn't realize it until it is almost too late. When she discovers that her close friend Harriet Smith has also developed feelings for Mr. Knightley, and believes that he reciprocates, she suddenly realizes that she doesn't want to lose him. Fortunately for Emma, in the end he declares his true feelings to her and the two marry. So is it an ending that we agree with? Actually it is. We really love the relationship between Emma and the handsome and charming Mr. K - he is unflinchingly honest with her but never cruelly so. We love the scene in the park when he gives her a dressing down for her flippant treatment of poor Miss Bates; it clearly pains him to hurt her and yet he knows that it is the only way to maintain their friendship. And his proposal to her is another one of our favorite moments. Both are attractive and well off, and they share the same social circle. Both are happy people that genuinely care about their family and friends, and they both seem quite content in their little corner of the world. We think that they will have similar views about where and how to live, and how to raise their eventual family. Of course the Knightleys are long gone by now, but we feel quite safe in saying that their union was a happy and long-lasting one, filled with long talks, laughter, plenty of good arguments, and lots of little Knightleys. http://www.reel-couples.com/the-couple-emma-woodhouse-mr-knightley/ Reel Thing Rating: 5 out of 5 Reels

    I can't find any more ways to say the word cute while taking notes during the film, because that's Emma in a nutshell. It's a petite, innocent, and simplistic movie that is sure to keep you involved in the story. It features some wonderful dialogue in Jane Austen's novel. It's a nicely composed film, even if the music is not utilized at time as it should be. Gwyneth Paltrow's performance shines like the champagne she drinks in the film, in a breakout role any actress would die for. Paltrow is ever-so-charming as the title character, and puts forth the effort to make this a memorable film and role. Emma is the type of film you'll love watching, it's even appropriate for children, the problem with it is that the fluff is light enough to carry the film into the family genre. There's no depth or artist storytelling, behind the film's green glass, clear water, long candlesticks, opulent furniture, exquisite flowers and classy decor. It does play off some classic fables, but never stomps on any new ground. It's just an amusing time. Emma is a delightful film, that's cute and fluffy with some fantastic visuals and a sparkling leading performance from Gwyneth Paltrow. Rating: 7/10; Grade: B+

    This is a beautifully filmed movie with a well cast group of actors. The countryside and interiors lovely English houses are picture perfect from a storybook painting. Gwyneth Paltrow looks lovely in the period costumes and acts charmingly. Her English accent is fine. Her supporting cast is well chosen. Toni Collette especially is cute and plump as Harriett. Ewan McGregor, Alan Cumming and Greta Scacchi are all quite suited to their roles too. It's still very funny and the complicated story is well told here. Nice to watch Clueless with Alicia Silverstone to see how a modern version of this story still works nearly 200 years later. After watching this version, the later television versions are redundant. Along with Pride and Prejudice starring Keira Knightley and Sense and Sensibility starring Kate Winslet this is the best movie version of Austen.

    This film just does not end. I know this film doesn't appeal to my tastes, but I've seen other dramas that set out to be historical fiction that are far more entertaining and far less clich&eacute; than this. The performances are incredibly dull and wooden, and I don't care if Paltrow is the leading lady. She is an unlikeable character, who is most meddlesome and a simpleton. The rest of the supporting cast is clich&eacute; and poorly written as well, earning no high remarks. Even Ewan McGregor fails to impress. Oh, and the script. It makes me cringe. The story and plot is essentially nonexistent, and each scene is entirely too predictable. Even the soundtrack (which was nominated for an Academy Award) is so uninspired and is nothing simple regal score that grows more boring as the film progresses. The only plus are the sets; they are all fairly fantastic and filled with a lot of detail. With such great sets you would think that they would have better cinematography, but this film looks like it was shot by students straight out of film school. So aside from looking past the characters, "plot", and writing to appreciate the scenery, I can't stand this film. It's too clich&eacute;, too regal, and too predictable to be entertaining or interesting. I may be stepping on some people's toes, so I apologize. But for me this film just doesn't cut it and is, simply, a lazy effort and an annoying adaptation of a famed novel.

    Emma is one of the most challenging movies to review, because of how average it is. No outstanding qualities, and many flaws, none of them completely horrible. It's certainly watchable, but it's a very shallow experience, so unmemorable as to add to the challenge of writing a review, mere days after watching it. I haven't read the novel, so I don't know if the movie faithfully follows its plot. The setting is the early 19th century, and focuses on the high society of a small town. There, Hariet Smith, is enamoured with a farmer and her friend Emma considers he is not a suitable match for her. So she dedicates a great deal of her time in finding her a better (in her opinion), more high-class fianc&eacute;. All the while, several men are revolving around her as well, but she gives them only superficial thought, concentrated as she is on making plans for Harriet. It never really gets further or deeper than that. The inevitable happy end is at once predictable and untimely, falling out of the blue. The acting is too stiff and full of simper, even for a story supposed to happen 200 years ago in the English upper-class. Nor Gwyneth Paltrow, nor any of the actors for that matter, manage to make the viewers relate to the characters. When all the actors give such a bad performance, I suppose the true culprit is director Douglas McGrath. Still, despite all its flaws, there is some charm to be found if one makes the effort to take this piece with a light mind. Perhaps it's the nice English country landscapes. Perhaps the old-fashioned affected languageÂ… Because of this, it's not hard to let yourself carry to the end of this otherwise slightly boring, mostly forgettable movie.

    This is a pure "bagatelle", but very charming, entertaining and heart-warming. I loved the beautiful photo of the typical English dream-idyll: the thatched cottages in their tiny gardens, the great mansions, the ball-room dancing, all the beautiful clothes and hairdos... from a time when men were allowed to be men, and women were allowed to be women. There was even a nice vicar and a geese shepherdess in a bonnet to make it complete..! :-) Of course one could argue that these people were a small, fortunate minority, who could devote so much of their time and energy to social life, entertaining, match-making and affairs of the heart. In a time when the majority were poor, sometimes very poor, and only seldom could take any time off from their hard labour. One could also argue, that attractive unmarried gentlemen in their most virile age, and with the financial means to keep mistresses or visit prostitutes, probably were not this wholesome and innocent in reality... and probably not all ladies either. But today, on Twelfth Night, I preferred to try to forget about all that, and just enjoy the charming story and the beautiful pictures in the company of my 10-year old daughter! I recommend the movie to girls and women of all ages, and especially those who nourish a dream about Old English Romance..! :-) P.S. It was a long time since I read the novel, so I cannot say anything about if the movie was faithful to it or not. I have reviewed the movie as a separate work of art altogether.

    bitesizemoviereview dot blogspot dot com Though I have not read the Jane Austen novel, I thoroughly enjoyed this film adaption. For the most part, the acting was good and the sets were decent. Every now and then, a character would appear in a coat or a haircut that seemed out of place for the time period. Paltrow was well-suited for her role as Emma, a nosy but likable "matchmaker." The dances performed in the film seemed to be taken from A&E's Pride and Prejudice a year earlier--of course, the time period is relatively the same, but Emma would have been better off not using the exact same dance and musical score. Although the quality of this film is not top-notch, I enjoyed it for the witty acting and light romance plot.

    I am a fan of classic novels, and authors like Jane Austen and Bronte sisters hold a special place in my library. Jane Austen's novels have always been quite appeasing, but unfortunately the movie doesn't seem to do justice to the novel. After watching Gwyneth Paltrow in The Talented Mr. Ripley and Shakespeare in Love, I did expect the movie to be great. But turns out the other movie by the same name did much more justice to the novel than this one. Though the movie does follow the novel most of the time (I can recall only two scenes that don't exist in the novel), but the way things represent themselves in the novel, the movie hasn't been able to bring the characters to life. Except for the title character on whom the movie (or the novel) is based, the remaining characters have been badly undermined, thus lacking the humor of the novel. Watching movies is my passion as are the books and I often watch movies again, but this one won't be one the list for second watching. Thanks.

    Seeing this recently for the first time in 15 years, I was disappointed by its mediocrity. A talented cast is largely wasted, and among their number I do not include Paltrow, who hardly qualifies as talented on this evidence. Her stilted, mannered, plodding approach to her lines suggests that her energy was sapped by the effort of achieving an appropriate accent. However, this was clearly not a problem a few years later in Shakespeare in Love, and the faults of her performance here merely exemplify those of the production as a whole -- faults for which, one imagines, McGrath is largely to blame, though his Nicholas Nickleby a few years later shows that he too was capable of better. The movie is to be cherished for Juliet Stevenson's marvellous (though sadly truncated) turn as Mrs. Elton, but on the whole the film falls far short of the lively, sensitive, and above all natural, TV version of 2009, in which Christina Cole's Mrs Elton is only one of several outstanding performances.

    This is definitely the chocolate-box version of Emma. It focuses on all the comedic, light-hearted elements of the story over everything else. Quite a bit had to be cut for time, and the Frank Churchill/Jane Fairfax story suffered the most, I think. Still, most of the cast was good (with some exceptions!) and it's a fun romantic comedyÂ…even if it's not the best adaptation. I especially love Gwyneth Paltrow's Emma. Jeremy Northam is perhaps a bit too suave but still good as Mr. Knightley. The Eltons and Miss Bates were also great. Unfortunately Toni Collette was awful as Harriet Smith, as were Ewan McGregor as Frank Churchill (hideous wig) and Polly Walker as Jane Fairfax (too robust). This was a fun movie, but not quite Jane Austen's Emma. The Mr. Elton story was given a lot more focus over the Frank Churchill one. I think if I could change just one thing, I'd play up the Frank/Jane story more. Oh, and get rid of the ugly wig as well.

    Meddlesome though she may be, there is still something incredibly endearing about Emma Woodhouse. Her actions are all completely misguided and yet there is no doubt that she acts out of love. Emma Woodhouse lives in 19th century England, and according to her creator, Jane Austen, is "handsome, clever, and rich." She considers herself an expert matchmaker and spends her days planning elaborate liaisons for her friends. The results are always disastrous, for though Emma is convinced she knows what's best for everyone, she is oblivious of their true wants and desires, as well as her own. Her close friend Mr. Knightley watches with both amusement and dismay, for he can see clearly what Emma cannot. Yet being in love with her tries to guide her as best he can. Emma loves him too, but doesn't realize it until it is almost too late. When she discovers that her close friend Harriet Smith has also developed feelings for Mr. Knightley, and believes that he reciprocates, she suddenly realizes that she doesn't want to lose him. Fortunately for Emma, in the end he declares his true feelings to her and the two marry. So is it an ending that we agree with? Actually it is. We really love the relationship between Emma and the handsome and charming Mr. K - he is unflinchingly honest with her but never cruelly so. We love the scene in the park when he gives her a dressing down for her flippant treatment of poor Miss Bates; it clearly pains him to hurt her and yet he knows that it is the only way to maintain their friendship. And his proposal to her is another one of our favorite moments. Both are attractive and well off, and they share the same social circle. Both are happy people that genuinely care about their family and friends, and they both seem quite content in their little corner of the world. We think that they will have similar views about where and how to live, and how to raise their eventual family. Of course the Knightleys are long gone by now, but we feel quite safe in saying that their union was a happy and long-lasting one, filled with long talks, laughter, plenty of good arguments, and lots of little Knightleys. http://www.reel-couples.com/the-couple-emma-woodhouse-mr-knightley/ Reel Thing Rating: 5 out of 5 Reels
