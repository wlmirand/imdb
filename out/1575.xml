 <storyline>
  A viceroy and an archbishop take their posts in Mexico. A local nun, Sor Juana In&eacute;s de la Cruz (1651-1695), intrigues them. The viceroy and his wife find her brilliant and fascinating. The prelate finds her a symbol of European laxity. He engineers the election of a new abbess, severe and ascetic. The virreina visits Sor Juana often and inspires her to write passionate poetry that the archbishop finds scandalous. The viceroy protects her. After he is replaced and returns to Spain with his wife, Sor Juana faces envy and retribution. A bishop betrays her, her confessor humbles her. Plague, a tribunal, and her confession as "the worst of all" end the great poet's life.

    The true story of Sister Juana Inez de la Cruz, a nun in 17th century Mexico, born a peasant, who later became known as one of the great poets of the Spanish language. But in her own time she was crushed by a Catholic church frightened of women pursuing intellectual or artistic truths The film is beautifully shot, well acted, and always interesting. It's an important story of an early feminist. But I had a few problems. First, the highly theatrical sets and lighting, while a style I often respond to, didn't really seem to be serving a purpose here since the story is acted and written in a fairly naturalistic, straightforward way. I found myself pulled out of the film again and again to say 'neat lighting' or 'cool set'. Perhaps more importantly, the climatic twist of the film, Sister Juana's finally having her spirit and soul crushed by the church, happens way too rapidly, and mostly off-camera. This is a woman who would seem ready to be put to death by the Inquisition for being herself, and suddenly, without our seeing how it happened she is mopping the floor, and staring off into space. Last, the film sets up its antagonists, and their positions of power so clearly, that there is only one possible path for the story to travel. We know Juana will eventually become a victim, so the film becomes just waiting for that painful decline. None-the-less, a worthwhile film about an important artist and early voice for women's rights who is sadly under-known by much of the world.

    Who would have guessed that there is a genre out there called nunsploitation. I am not sure what it means, but this film appears to be included. It is the story of a Mexican nun that was decidedly feminist. You can look up Juana In&eacute;s de la Cruz on Wikipedia and it will give you more. Apparently this film is historically accurate according to those I have consulted. The main thrust of this film is the intense hatred (Can one say fear?) of women by the Church through the ages, which continues to this day. It examines the Inquisition, by which the Church sought to stifle creativity and thinking. One would do well to know the status of women in the Church at the time to properly understand and enjoy this film. The role of women can be defined: "it is right for (women) to pride themselves on being silent, both those for whom it is convenient to cover up their lack of knowledge, and those who might shamelessly reveal what they know, because in all of them it is not only an agreeable condition, but a proper virtue, to speak little and be silent." Unlike Saint Teresa, Sr Juana is castigated not canonized for the audacity to speak her mind, to seek knowledge, and to think. If you seek the "lesbian passion behind convent walls" that is on the DVD cover, you will be sorely disappointed. While a lesbian relationship might be strongly suggested between Sr Juana and her noble protectress, it is never overtly expressed with the exception of a kiss that would be considered an "air kiss" compared to the one Phoebe gave Rachel on "Friends." The film was extremely interesting and Assumpta Serna was outstanding as Sr Juana.

    When I picked up this DVD, I thought this was a movie whose main theme was Lesbianism--at least that's what many would assume about it judging by the DVD cover. And while this might have made a very interesting subject for a film, this was not at all what the film was about in the least!! Apart from a rather innocent kiss between Sister Juana and her lady friend, there is NOTHING about this film that could be construed as a gay or even straight picture. The women MIGHT have been in love with each other, but they never acted upon this and this really wasn't the main message of the film. Instead, its a story about a real-life nun, poet and scholar and the difficulties encountered by being all these during the days of the Spanish Inquisition. Juana is a brilliant and very accomplished woman who was not allowed to enter the university because women simply weren't allowed to do this. A woman either needed to marry and make babies or become a nun--and she chose to become a nun because she believed she could pursue her studies of space, the word, philosophy, and especially poetry this way. And for a while, this was the case--until an overzealous new Mexican Archbishop saw her curiosity about the world as a sign of wickedness! Instead of Lesbianism, the film is actually about wasted talent and misogyny--a super-talented lady who was despised for being different! This movie would be excellent fair for teens and young adults--especially young women daring to walk their own path. As a father of two very accomplished girls, I would hope that this real-life story would inspire them. As far as the technical merits of the movie go, it is very well acted, written and produced. It was a bit slow-going at times, but considering it was reality, this can't be helped. And despite this, the film could have been scored a 9 by me--it was very, very close.

    Juana Ines de la Cruz was a woman ahead of her times. She had everything going against her; she was a woman, she had intelligence, and she intimidated the people around her. Everything conspired to make her a target for the higher ups in the Catholic Church in Mexico. The Archbishop wanted to silence her at all costs. These were the times when the so called Holy Inquisition was an instrument of the Church to get rid of anyone considered heretic, or who would question the dogma. It was a convenient way to get rid of the enemies, as the Catholic Church had such power that no one dared to challenge it. Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz wrote some of the best poetry known in the Spanish literature. Her work has survived because of the strength and beauty of her work. Sor Juana was befriended by the Spanish Viceroy and his wife. The virreina, in particular, saw in Juana a kindred spirit. Their relationship had shades of lesbianism, although only a chaste kiss is exchanged between them. When the Medinacellis are recalled home, Sor Juana is left at the mercy of the evil Archbishop who is bent in destroying her. Sor Juana Ines succumbs to the pest that took thousands in her country without being recognized in life for all she gave the world. Maria Luisa Bemberg, a feminist film maker, puts her stamp in this story by bringing together the influential virreina and Sor Juana, a combination of two strong women who lived during a period of uncertainty in Spain and her colonies in the new world. Asumpta Serna has some good moments as Juana Ines de la Cruz. Dominique Sanda is also effective playing opposite Ms. Serna as the virreina. Hector Alterio, Lautaro Murua, and the rest of the cast do a good job supporting the principal players. Cecilia Roth's dubbed the voice for Ms. Sanda. Felix Monti's dark cinematography serves the film well. The film was photographed in a studio, and at times, it looks as though it is a theater set. Ms. Bemberg directed with a sure hand and got a lot out of her cast and crew.

    Sor Juana battles through the film, a true story, to win the right to study. An interesting film, particularly from the feminist perspective. It is in ways uplifting to be reminded of women like Sor Juana, who stood up for women's rights to intelligence and who braved the wrath of the church. The ending, in particular, carries a great deal of poignancy. It is, in fact, fabricated by director Maria Luisa Bemberg, who, a Catholic feminist herself, wanted to portray the patriarchal Catholic church in a certain (negative) way. Sor Juana renounces her writing in the film, an ending which subverts history, however, there are many aspects of mise-en-scene that undermine the obvious reading that Juana is defeated. For example, she signs with her own blood (Bemberg was aware of the connotations of female blood for the Catholics) and there is a note at the end pointing out that Sor Juana is considered one of the greatest poets of her age, which shows that despite her apparent defeat, she still managed to be more famous than her oppressors to this day. There is no evidence that Juana ever renounced her writing, according to history she appeared to simply stopped writing. However, her self-humiliation at the end makes the film far more poignant, and her status as a brilliant scholar and poet all the more deserved and righteous, given the suffering she underwent.

    This is one of the few times in cinematic history where so much of the Spanisn Inquisition was explained for the full detail of what it entailed. I learned more about the politics of that time through this film than in my history classes. The connection Spain had with the 'new world' was stronger than any Britain had with her 'new world'. If you have a passion for history, a passion for what shaped the way the Catholic church now runs its show (in perspective with its history), then this movie is a must see. The acting, the writing, the production is second to none. I first saw this film in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1992 at the Edinburgh Film Festival... I've since looked for it elsewhere unsuccessfully...

    The best reason to see this movie is on account of the gorgeous camerawork; every frame is like stepping inside an art gallery. Velasquez in particular comes to mind, especially his Bodegones (kitchen pictures), which emphasized the inner dignity of maids and dishwashers. (A Spanish movie with a similar feel is Los Santos Inocentes). The pacing is extremely slow, as befits a story which is about the inner faith and turmoil of a 17th century poet-nun (Sor Juana). She always considered the external events of her life as secondary to the inner spiritual matters of faith and poetry, and this film attempts to portray that. You should not watch this unless you are comfortable with introspective meditation. Director Bemberg has a lot to say about the destruction of women's creative abilities through history (and should we be so arrogant as to suppose it never happens now?). <SPOILER> Sor Juana at the end of the film resembles the victim of torture or lobotomy, although we may suppose that the church used more subtle means to destroy her personality. (We aren't told what these are, but we see how she is then "terminated" by being sent to work in a plague hospital, where she succumbs). Sor Juana's relationships with those around her are shown with delicacy and depth; the acting is flawless. This film almost resembles silent cinema in the way it portrays glance-against-glance with few words being spoken. However, we sometimes get to hear Sor Juana"s poetry recited, usually in voice-over. Again, viewers uncomfortable with the contemplative approach are warned to stay away. YLPDT has probably suffered from the worst publicity-advertising of any movie ever, ensuring that it will be seen by those who don't like it and ignored by those who would have enjoyed it. If it is ever re-issued on VHS/DVD, let us hope the manufacturers show a bit more taste.

    A Great Historical Movie - Addresses the Lesbian Continuum

    The movie is well made, although not much money seems to have been spent on sets! It sticks fairly closely to the basic historical data, but a quick read up on Sor Juana in the Encyclopedia Brittanica might help many viewers. Now to the rating issue. There is no good reason why this movie should be restricted to those over 18 by Amazon and other online merchants. There is no overt nudity or genital sex. There is a fairly chaste kiss between women. I suppose the violent scenes of nuns whipping themsleves in a penitential exercise might be offensive to some, but self-flagellation was indeed a part of Catholic monastic life until well into the 20th century, and the scene is not presented in any prurient way. If this amounts to a need to ban the movie for young people, then the Bible also would need to be banned. It has far more sex, nudity, and violence. The writers who object to the "Lesbian passion" line on the box do have a point. Anyone buying this for erotic arousal would be profoundly mislead. There is, however, a real lesbian aspect to this film. Sor Juana is clearly a "woman identified woman." She achieves her greatest triumphs while in the nurturing and all-female world of the Convent; her relationship with the Vicereine is the most heated in the film; and the destruction of her writing comes from the intrusion of the exclusively male world of the church hierarchy and the inquistion. Most importantly, her writing reflects an explicit feminist critique of women's oppression. Just as one does not need to have genital sex in order to be a "heterosexual," neither does one need genital sex in order to be part of the lesbian continuum. Sor Juana is indeed part of the that continuum.

    This film is an interesting historical piece set in the late 17th century. It is in Spanish and is based on a book by noted Mexican author Octavio Paz, which was itself based on a true story. The story is about Sor Juana, a nun and poet in Spanish Mexico who challenges the theology of the archbishop. In doing so, it also explores the tension between the church and the crown, in this case between the archbishop and the viceroy, who supports Sor Juana. The camera work and use of color, light, and shadow throughout the film sets the mood quite well. While it occasionally seems a little drawn out, in general it is an interesting, effective and entertaining work.
