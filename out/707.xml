 <storyline>
  This slow-paced gem is about the civilizing influence of Italy on beleaguered Londoners both male and female and has it's own civilizing influence on the viewer. It's almost like taking a little mini-trip to Italy, a gorgeously filmed enchantment.

    A dud and a bore. Evidently I am not a "play" type person. I am sorry but 4 middle aged women wondering about love and relationships with their husbands is boring period. Give it a feminist twist a couple poorly cast characters and you get either sleep or torture. I particularly found the "beautiful" woman Caroline Dexter bothersome people who think they are beautiful and aren't are such a turn off.... but wouldn't this be the director's fault? During the first 5 minutes of the movie I should have followed my impulse to turn it off when I saw the feminist twist to it = a shy woman is going against all custom and going on a high adventure holiday without her husband (renting castle like villa in Italy with 4 other women a la golden girls). Is there such a category as yuppie feminist boring fluff with pretenses of depth? There was nothing deep or interesting in this thing... even the most boring soap opera has a story this of course was "above" all that. Avoid like the plague

    Unforgettable movie--fabulously elegant, charming, funny, poignant, and human in a very positive way. I was reminded about Enchanted April when I watched Foyles' War, recognized Michael Kitchen, and searched his filmography to see where I had "met" him before.It's been years since I have seen it, but it's on my list to see again. The characters compliment each other and the actors were perfectly chosen as an ensemble that seamlessly produced a flowing, moving, and joyfully entertaining mini-masterpiece of a film. Rarely do movies create and sustain a mood that touches the souls of the audience the way Enchanted April does. I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys filmmaking at its most authentic and genuine.

    An enchanting film. It gets off to a slow start, but once the two women get off to their vacation, things pick up, and we get an engrossing story. The story was filmed as a mini-series for the BBC in 1992, and it was released theatrically in the US. The story takes place in England in the Twenties, and Lottie (played by Josie Lawrence) is sick of the weather - it's March - dreary, and rainy. Lottie and Rose (Miranda Richardson) become acquainted and are unhappy in their marriages, so they decide to rent a villa in Italy for the month of April. They can't quite afford it, though, so they advertise for another two ladies, and a more dissimilar quartet would be hard to imagine. Lottie's and Rose's husbands are played by Alfred Molino and Jim Broadbent, and all four are excellent. Joan Plowright and Polly Walker play the other two woman sharing the villa. Things get off to a rocky start and the ladies defend their turf and come to terms about who shall dominate whom. But the Italian April works its enchantment on them, and soon things go much better. Lottie decides to invite her husband to see if the magic can help them reconcile. Rose then writes to her husband to invite him. Then things get sticky. Jim Broadbent's character has been chasing Polly Walker's character unknown to Rose; Rose is being pursued by the owner of the villa. The resolution of the various threads is well done, and the ending is satisfying. If you like this movie, I recommend "Smiles of a Summer Night" and vice versa.

    If you need a vacation in January, pop this video in and relax. The atmosphere and heart of this movie are its best parts. Not to detract from the story and the performances, because they are stupendous. This film makes me happy just watching it. After the storm and on the first day in Italy, the window opens (ala "The Wizard of Oz") but, this is no fantasy. This film is perfection as it shows the development of the characters through love and kindness. Every aspect of this film satisfies. The acting, screenplay, original story, cinematography, and so on... I can't say enough about this movie. One of my all-time favorites. Hope it is yours too! Do yourself a favor and watch it.

    From rainy, dreary late winter England of early 1920s... ---where there is still sadness and many young widows and disabled vets from the great slaughter of men and killer of their womens' dreams--- known now as World War I... Four women share this lovely small sunny Italian castle on a hill; one a young widow who is drowning her sorrow in frantic partying, two women who will rediscover their own husbands, and a fourth woman who is tired of her famous dead friends... ...These four women will come together with two husbands and a former soldier - almost blind - to get a spiritual "makeover" for one great April vacation in early 1920's Italy. NOTE to would-be filmmakers. Study this film for how mood and beauty can tell a story. (Probably not a film to please many men...) NOTE: Stock up on coffee & hot chocolate and invite the girls over on some dreary late winter day...Spring is coming...Enchanted April promises you!

    There's a breath of spring feeling about ENCHANTED APRIL--nothing deep, just a story of four women who want to escape from it all, share a villa in Italy, and find that the enchanted environment brings about small changes in each one of them in a positive manner. MIRANDA RICHARDSON is the quiet housewife who seems to think her husband is bored with her; POLLY WALKER is a pretty socialite who wants to be admired for more than her beauty; JOAN PLOWBRIGHT is a crotchety older woman who learns to appreciate friendship when it's offered; and JOSIE LAWRENCE is the rather scatterbrained, almost eccentric woman who is unsure about her marriage until she invites her husband (JIM BROADBENT) to the charming place in the country where she feels nothing but good vibes. MICHAEL KITCHEN is the owner of the villa who falls for Richardson, thinking she's a widow, but then finds consolation with the pretty socialite who appreciates that he didn't warm up to her on the basis of her looks alone (he's nearsighted). Most humorous aspect of the story is the relationship between Walker and her hubby, ALFRED MOLINA, whose relaxing bath turns into one of the films only "explosive" moments when he fails to understand Italian and the meaning of the word for dangerous. It's a simple tale, woven tightly together by the four strands of storytelling, and passes the time pleasantly enough even though there are times when nothing seems to be happening. The pace is very slow, even for a film with a running time of little more than an hour and thirty minutes, so it's not a tale for every taste. It's a quietly reflective character study of perfect strangers learning about each other. Nicely photographed in Italian locations, it's visually pleasing and easy to take, but really nothing special happens here.

    After being involved in the theatrical version i find the film version disjointed and boring. Lines said by one character in the play are said by a different character in the film and some characters have entirely different names. There also seems to me an excessive amount of editing between locations. (There is even more jumping around between London scenes than the play.) Also the scene where Mellersh is eating near the beginning of the film i find repulsive and unnecessary. Once the action moves to Italy the film improves, but not enough to save it ultimately. Jim Broadbent, although an actor i enjoy watching, was miscast in this outing.

    Enchanted April is a tone poem, an impressionist painting, a masterpiece of conveying a message with few words. It has been one of my 10 favorite films since it came out. I continue to wait, albeit less patiently, for the film to come out in DVD format. Apparently, I am not alone. If parent company Amazon's listings are correct, there are many people who want this title in DVD format. Many people want to go to Italy with this cast and this script. Many people want to keep a permanent copy of this film in their libraries. The cast is spectacular, the cinematography and direction impeccable. The film is a definite keeper. Many have already asked. Please add our names to the list.

    I absolutely loved this movie. I am not even sure what particularly about it but I think it was wonderful and should be available for DVD. The women were strangers and yet got along well enough to spend the time they did in the Villa in Italy. The actors, in my opinion, did an excellent job. The characters were all so different and yet clever story that made it work. There is humor, drama and relationship issues all in good time. This requires 10 lines but I just can't think of any more to say so I will just rattle on until I get 10 lines. So sorry about this. What else can I possibly say it has been a long time since I last saw it. I am looking forward to view again but it isn't available.

    Two thirds of nearly 2,000 IMDb users who have voted on this film have rated it at 8, 9 or 10 and one user reports wearing out six videotapes (Was this a record, or merely a faulty VCR?). Although the film is primarily intended as a period piece it clearly has a quite unusual fascination. But for some reason I imagined it as largely whimsy and until recently never felt the urge to watch it. My mind was changed by Elizbeth Von Arnim's original book. My wife loves reading but her sight no longer allows her to read much so she borrowed it in talking book form. Such books are usually irritating to a companion who is busy with other things, but I gradually came to appreciate that this one was seductively soothing, although in no way syrupy, and was also very well written. I realised my wife would enjoy watching the film, and so decided to buy her the videotape. I am now very glad that I did, and would certainly recommend its purchase to anyone else who appreciates a quiet reflective work with no fireworks but with well constructed character development and a very successful pre-Mussolini Italian atmosphere. The story is set in the immediate post WW1 period and starts with two married London ladies who decide to pool their savings and enjoy a holiday together, away from their families, in a rented villa in Italy. Force of circumstances lead to this couple being joined by two others with very different characters and backgrounds. Its theme is essentially no more than the interactions that take place as their holiday progresses, not only between these four very disparate mature ladies, but also with the occasional male visitor. If you want action, thrills, dramatic sex scenes, natural or man-made disasters, or Harlequin style romances this would not be the film for you. But IMDb users have collectively and very emphatically demonstrated that none of these are necessary for a film to prove highly rewarding to watch, and if you care to give it a try you may, as I did, come to rank it among your much loved films. It is fairly rare for me to watch a film of a book with which I am already familiar. In many cases I find this takes some of the pleasure away from watching the film, but here there is such a strong visual appeal in the setting that I actually found my pleasure augmented by the anticipation of seeing the next segment of the book, effectively unrolled before my eyes. (Perhaps Italy itself has some part in this, the last time I had this experience was when I was watching tales from Boccaccio's Decameron on TV.) Generally films of books tend to increase the dramatic level of the original work to ensure that the filmed version has an even wider appeal, but here if anything it is reduced in order to keep the viewers attention on the gradual character development rather than on any background events. This works very well, although changes from the book are few and basically the film remains true to the original story. Great credit is due to the Director, Mike Newell, and all members of the cast, particularly those well known British Actresses who play the four principal ladies.

Is there such a category as yuppie feminist boring fluff with pretenses of depth? There was nothing deep or interesting in this thing... even the most boring soap opera has a story this of course was "above" all that. Avoid like the plague

    Unforgettable movie--fabulously elegant, charming, funny, poignant, and human in a very positive way. I was reminded about Enchanted April when I watched Foyles' War, recognized Michael Kitchen, and searched his filmography to see where I had "met" him before.It's been years since I have seen it, but it's on my list to see again. The characters compliment each other and the actors were perfectly chosen as an ensemble that seamlessly produced a flowing, moving, and joyfully entertaining mini-masterpiece of a film. Rarely do movies create and sustain a mood that touches the souls of the audience the way Enchanted April does. I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys filmmaking at its most authentic and genuine.

    An enchanting film. It gets off to a slow start, but once the two women get off to their vacation, things pick up, and we get an engrossing story. The story was filmed as a mini-series for the BBC in 1992, and it was released theatrically in the US. The story takes place in England in the Twenties, and Lottie (played by Josie Lawrence) is sick of the weather - it's March - dreary, and rainy. Lottie and Rose (Miranda Richardson) become acquainted and are unhappy in their marriages, so they decide to rent a villa in Italy for the month of April. They can't quite afford it, though, so they advertise for another two ladies, and a more dissimilar quartet would be hard to imagine. Lottie's and Rose's husbands are played by Alfred Molino and Jim Broadbent, and all four are excellent. Joan Plowright and Polly Walker play the other two woman sharing the villa. Things get off to a rocky start and the ladies defend their turf and come to terms about who shall dominate whom. But the Italian April works its enchantment on them, and soon things go much better. Lottie decides to invite her husband to see if the magic can help them reconcile. Rose then writes to her husband to invite him. Then things get sticky. Jim Broadbent's character has been chasing Polly Walker's character unknown to Rose; Rose is being pursued by the owner of the villa. The resolution of the various threads is well done, and the ending is satisfying. If you like this movie, I recommend "Smiles of a Summer Night" and vice versa.

    If you need a vacation in January, pop this video in and relax. The atmosphere and heart of this movie are its best parts. Not to detract from the story and the performances, because they are stupendous. This film makes me happy just watching it. After the storm and on the first day in Italy, the window opens (ala "The Wizard of Oz") but, this is no fantasy. This film is perfection as it shows the development of the characters through love and kindness. Every aspect of this film satisfies. The acting, screenplay, original story, cinematography, and so on... I can't say enough about this movie. One of my all-time favorites. Hope it is yours too! Do yourself a favor and watch it.

    From rainy, dreary late winter England of early 1920s... ---where there is still sadness and many young widows and disabled vets from the great slaughter of men and killer of their womens' dreams--- known now as World War I... Four women share this lovely small sunny Italian castle on a hill; one a young widow who is drowning her sorrow in frantic partying, two women who will rediscover their own husbands, and a fourth woman who is tired of her famous dead friends... ...These four women will come together with two husbands and a former soldier - almost blind - to get a spiritual "makeover" for one great April vacation in early 1920's Italy. NOTE to would-be filmmakers. Study this film for how mood and beauty can tell a story. (Probably not a film to please many men...) NOTE: Stock up on coffee & hot chocolate and invite the girls over on some dreary late winter day...Spring is coming...Enchanted April promises you!

    There's a breath of spring feeling about ENCHANTED APRIL--nothing deep, just a story of four women who want to escape from it all, share a villa in Italy, and find that the enchanted environment brings about small changes in each one of them in a positive manner. MIRANDA RICHARDSON is the quiet housewife who seems to think her husband is bored with her; POLLY WALKER is a pretty socialite who wants to be admired for more than her beauty; JOAN PLOWBRIGHT is a crotchety older woman who learns to appreciate friendship when it's offered; and JOSIE LAWRENCE is the rather scatterbrained, almost eccentric woman who is unsure about her marriage until she invites her husband (JIM BROADBENT) to the charming place in the country where she feels nothing but good vibes. MICHAEL KITCHEN is the owner of the villa who falls for Richardson, thinking she's a widow, but then finds consolation with the pretty socialite who appreciates that he didn't warm up to her on the basis of her looks alone (he's nearsighted). Most humorous aspect of the story is the relationship between Walker and her hubby, ALFRED MOLINA, whose relaxing bath turns into one of the films only "explosive" moments when he fails to understand Italian and the meaning of the word for dangerous. It's a simple tale, woven tightly together by the four strands of storytelling, and passes the time pleasantly enough even though there are times when nothing seems to be happening. The pace is very slow, even for a film with a running time of little more than an hour and thirty minutes, so it's not a tale for every taste. It's a quietly reflective character study of perfect strangers learning about each other. Nicely photographed in Italian locations, it's visually pleasing and easy to take, but really nothing special happens here.

    After being involved in the theatrical version i find the film version disjointed and boring. Lines said by one character in the play are said by a different character in the film and some characters have entirely different names. There also seems to me an excessive amount of editing between locations. (There is even more jumping around between London scenes than the play.) Also the scene where Mellersh is eating near the beginning of the film i find repulsive and unnecessary. Once the action moves to Italy the film improves, but not enough to save it ultimately. Jim Broadbent, although an actor i enjoy watching, was miscast in this outing.

    Enchanted April is a tone poem, an impressionist painting, a masterpiece of conveying a message with few words. It has been one of my 10 favorite films since it came out. I continue to wait, albeit less patiently, for the film to come out in DVD format. Apparently, I am not alone. If parent company Amazon's listings are correct, there are many people who want this title in DVD format. Many people want to go to Italy with this cast and this script. Many people want to keep a permanent copy of this film in their libraries. The cast is spectacular, the cinematography and direction impeccable. The film is a definite keeper. Many have already asked. Please add our names to the list.

    I absolutely loved this movie. I am not even sure what particularly about it but I think it was wonderful and should be available for DVD. The women were strangers and yet got along well enough to spend the time they did in the Villa in Italy. The actors, in my opinion, did an excellent job. The characters were all so different and yet clever story that made it work. There is humor, drama and relationship issues all in good time. This requires 10 lines but I just can't think of any more to say so I will just rattle on until I get 10 lines. So sorry about this. What else can I possibly say it has been a long time since I last saw it. I am looking forward to view again but it isn't available.

    Two thirds of nearly 2,000 IMDb users who have voted on this film have rated it at 8, 9 or 10 and one user reports wearing out six videotapes (Was this a record, or merely a faulty VCR?). Although the film is primarily intended as a period piece it clearly has a quite unusual fascination. But for some reason I imagined it as largely whimsy and until recently never felt the urge to watch it. My mind was changed by Elizbeth Von Arnim's original book. My wife loves reading but her sight no longer allows her to read much so she borrowed it in talking book form. Such books are usually irritating to a companion who is busy with other things, but I gradually came to appreciate that this one was seductively soothing, although in no way syrupy, and was also very well written. I realised my wife would enjoy watching the film, and so decided to buy her the videotape. I am now very glad that I did, and would certainly recommend its purchase to anyone else who appreciates a quiet reflective work with no fireworks but with well constructed character development and a very successful pre-Mussolini Italian atmosphere. The story is set in the immediate post WW1 period and starts with two married London ladies who decide to pool their savings and enjoy a holiday together, away from their families, in a rented villa in Italy. Force of circumstances lead to this couple being joined by two others with very different characters and backgrounds. Its theme is essentially no more than the interactions that take place as their holiday progresses, not only between these four very disparate mature ladies, but also with the occasional male visitor. If you want action, thrills, dramatic sex scenes, natural or man-made disasters, or Harlequin style romances this would not be the film for you. But IMDb users have collectively and very emphatically demonstrated that none of these are necessary for a film to prove highly rewarding to watch, and if you care to give it a try you may, as I did, come to rank it among your much loved films. It is fairly rare for me to watch a film of a book with which I am already familiar. In many cases I find this takes some of the pleasure away from watching the film, but here there is such a strong visual appeal in the setting that I actually found my pleasure augmented by the anticipation of seeing the next segment of the book, effectively unrolled before my eyes. (Perhaps Italy itself has some part in this, the last time I had this experience was when I was watching tales from Boccaccio's Decameron on TV.) Generally films of books tend to increase the dramatic level of the original work to ensure that the filmed version has an even wider appeal, but here if anything it is reduced in order to keep the viewers attention on the gradual character development rather than on any background events. This works very well, although changes from the book are few and basically the film remains true to the original story. Great credit is due to the Director, Mike Newell, and all members of the cast, particularly those well known British Actresses who play the four principal ladies.

    A dud and a bore. Evidently I am not a "play" type person. I am sorry but 4 middle aged women wondering about love and relationships with their husbands is boring period. Give it a feminist twist a couple poorly cast characters and you get either sleep or torture.

    An enchanting film. It gets off to a slow start, but once the two women get off to their vacation, things pick up, and we get an engrossing story. The story was filmed as a mini-series for the BBC in 1992, and it was released theatrically in the US. The story takes place in England in the Twenties, and Lottie (played by Josie Lawrence) is sick of the weather - it's March - dreary, and rainy. Lottie and Rose (Miranda Richardson) become acquainted and are unhappy in their marriages, so they decide to rent a villa in Italy for the month of April. They can't quite afford it, though, so they advertise for another two ladies, and a more dissimilar quartet would be hard to imagine. Lottie's and Rose's husbands are played by Alfred Molino and Jim Broadbent, and all four are excellent. Joan Plowright and Polly Walker play the other two woman sharing the villa. Things get off to a rocky start and the ladies defend their turf and come to terms about who shall dominate whom. But the Italian April works its enchantment on them, and soon things go much better. Lottie decides to invite her husband to see if the magic can help them reconcile. Rose then writes to her husband to invite him. Then things get sticky. Jim Broadbent's character has been chasing Polly Walker's character unknown to Rose; Rose is being pursued by the owner of the villa. The resolution of the various threads is well done, and the ending is satisfying. If you like this movie, I recommend "Smiles of a Summer Night" and vice versa.

    If you need a vacation in January, pop this video in and relax. The atmosphere and heart of this movie are its best parts. Not to detract from the story and the performances, because they are stupendous. This film makes me happy just watching it. After the storm and on the first day in Italy, the window opens (ala "The Wizard of Oz") but, this is no fantasy. This film is perfection as it shows the development of the characters through love and kindness. Every aspect of this film satisfies. The acting, screenplay, original story, cinematography, and so on... I can't say enough about this movie. One of my all-time favorites. Hope it is yours too! Do yourself a favor and watch it.

    From rainy, dreary late winter England of early 1920s... ---where there is still sadness and many young widows and disabled vets from the great slaughter of men and killer of their womens' dreams--- known now as World War I... Four women share this lovely small sunny Italian castle on a hill; one a young widow who is drowning her sorrow in frantic partying, two women who will rediscover their own husbands, and a fourth woman who is tired of her famous dead friends... ...These four women will come together with two husbands and a former soldier - almost blind - to get a spiritual "makeover" for one great April vacation in early 1920's Italy. NOTE to would-be filmmakers. Study this film for how mood and beauty can tell a story. (Probably not a film to please many men...) NOTE: Stock up on coffee & hot chocolate and invite the girls over on some dreary late winter day...Spring is coming...Enchanted April promises you!

    There's a breath of spring feeling about ENCHANTED APRIL--nothing deep, just a story of four women who want to escape from it all, share a villa in Italy, and find that the enchanted environment brings about small changes in each one of them in a positive manner. MIRANDA RICHARDSON is the quiet housewife who seems to think her husband is bored with her; POLLY WALKER is a pretty socialite who wants to be admired for more than her beauty; JOAN PLOWBRIGHT is a crotchety older woman who learns to appreciate friendship when it's offered; and JOSIE LAWRENCE is the rather scatterbrained, almost eccentric woman who is unsure about her marriage until she invites her husband (JIM BROADBENT) to the charming place in the country where she feels nothing but good vibes. MICHAEL KITCHEN is the owner of the villa who falls for Richardson, thinking she's a widow, but then finds consolation with the pretty socialite who appreciates that he didn't warm up to her on the basis of her looks alone (he's nearsighted). Most humorous aspect of the story is the relationship between Walker and her hubby, ALFRED MOLINA, whose relaxing bath turns into one of the films only "explosive" moments when he fails to understand Italian and the meaning of the word for dangerous. It's a simple tale, woven tightly together by the four strands of storytelling, and passes the time pleasantly enough even though there are times when nothing seems to be happening. The pace is very slow, even for a film with a running time of little more than an hour and thirty minutes, so it's not a tale for every taste. It's a quietly reflective character study of perfect strangers learning about each other. Nicely photographed in Italian locations, it's visually pleasing and easy to take, but really nothing special happens here.

    After being involved in the theatrical version i find the film version disjointed and boring. Lines said by one character in the play are said by a different character in the film and some characters have entirely different names. There also seems to me an excessive amount of editing between locations. (There is even more jumping around between London scenes than the play.) Also the scene where Mellersh is eating near the beginning of the film i find repulsive and unnecessary. Once the action moves to Italy the film improves, but not enough to save it ultimately. Jim Broadbent, although an actor i enjoy watching, was miscast in this outing.

    Enchanted April is a tone poem, an impressionist painting, a masterpiece of conveying a message with few words. It has been one of my 10 favorite films since it came out. I continue to wait, albeit less patiently, for the film to come out in DVD format. Apparently, I am not alone. If parent company Amazon's listings are correct, there are many people who want this title in DVD format. Many people want to go to Italy with this cast and this script. Many people want to keep a permanent copy of this film in their libraries. The cast is spectacular, the cinematography and direction impeccable. The film is a definite keeper. Many have already asked. Please add our names to the list.

    I absolutely loved this movie. I am not even sure what particularly about it but I think it was wonderful and should be available for DVD. The women were strangers and yet got along well enough to spend the time they did in the Villa in Italy. The actors, in my opinion, did an excellent job. The characters were all so different and yet clever story that made it work. There is humor, drama and relationship issues all in good time. This requires 10 lines but I just can't think of any more to say so I will just rattle on until I get 10 lines. So sorry about this. What else can I possibly say it has been a long time since I last saw it. I am looking forward to view again but it isn't available.

    Two thirds of nearly 2,000 IMDb users who have voted on this film have rated it at 8, 9 or 10 and one user reports wearing out six videotapes (Was this a record, or merely a faulty VCR?). Although the film is primarily intended as a period piece it clearly has a quite unusual fascination. But for some reason I imagined it as largely whimsy and until recently never felt the urge to watch it. My mind was changed by Elizbeth Von Arnim's original book. My wife loves reading but her sight no longer allows her to read much so she borrowed it in talking book form. Such books are usually irritating to a companion who is busy with other things, but I gradually came to appreciate that this one was seductively soothing, although in no way syrupy, and was also very well written. I realised my wife would enjoy watching the film, and so decided to buy her the videotape. I am now very glad that I did, and would certainly recommend its purchase to anyone else who appreciates a quiet reflective work with no fireworks but with well constructed character development and a very successful pre-Mussolini Italian atmosphere. The story is set in the immediate post WW1 period and starts with two married London ladies who decide to pool their savings and enjoy a holiday together, away from their families, in a rented villa in Italy. Force of circumstances lead to this couple being joined by two others with very different characters and backgrounds. Its theme is essentially no more than the interactions that take place as their holiday progresses, not only between these four very disparate mature ladies, but also with the occasional male visitor. If you want action, thrills, dramatic sex scenes, natural or man-made disasters, or Harlequin style romances this would not be the film for you. But IMDb users have collectively and very emphatically demonstrated that none of these are necessary for a film to prove highly rewarding to watch, and if you care to give it a try you may, as I did, come to rank it among your much loved films. It is fairly rare for me to watch a film of a book with which I am already familiar. In many cases I find this takes some of the pleasure away from watching the film, but here there is such a strong visual appeal in the setting that I actually found my pleasure augmented by the anticipation of seeing the next segment of the book, effectively unrolled before my eyes. (Perhaps Italy itself has some part in this, the last time I had this experience was when I was watching tales from Boccaccio's Decameron on TV.) Generally films of books tend to increase the dramatic level of the original work to ensure that the filmed version has an even wider appeal, but here if anything it is reduced in order to keep the viewers attention on the gradual character development rather than on any background events. This works very well, although changes from the book are few and basically the film remains true to the original story. Great credit is due to the Director, Mike Newell, and all members of the cast, particularly those well known British Actresses who play the four principal ladies.

    A dud and a bore. Evidently I am not a "play" type person. I am sorry but 4 middle aged women wondering about love and relationships with their husbands is boring period. Give it a feminist twist a couple poorly cast characters and you get either sleep or torture. I particularly found the "beautiful" woman Caroline Dexter bothersome people who think they are beautiful and aren't are such a turn off.... but wouldn't this be the director's fault? During the first 5 minutes of the movie I should have followed my impulse to turn it off when I saw the feminist twist to it = a shy woman is going against all custom and going on a high adventure holiday without her husband (renting castle like villa in Italy with 4 other women a la golden girls). Is there such a category as yuppie feminist boring fluff with pretenses of depth? There was nothing deep or interesting in this thing... even the most boring soap opera has a story this of course was "above" all that. Avoid like the plague

    Unforgettable movie--fabulously elegant, charming, funny, poignant, and human in a very positive way. I was reminded about Enchanted April when I watched Foyles' War, recognized Michael Kitchen, and searched his filmography to see where I had "met" him before.It's been years since I have seen it, but it's on my list to see again. The characters compliment each other and the actors were perfectly chosen as an ensemble that seamlessly produced a flowing, moving, and joyfully entertaining mini-masterpiece of a film. Rarely do movies create and sustain a mood that touches the souls of the audience the way Enchanted April does. I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys filmmaking at its most authentic and genuine.

    An enchanting film. It gets off to a slow start, but once the two women get off to their vacation, things pick up, and we get an engrossing story. The story was filmed as a mini-series for the BBC in 1992, and it was released theatrically in the US. The story takes place in England in the Twenties, and Lottie (played by Josie Lawrence) is sick of the weather - it's March - dreary, and rainy. Lottie and Rose (Miranda Richardson) become acquainted and are unhappy in their marriages, so they decide to rent a villa in Italy for the month of April. They can't quite afford it, though, so they advertise for another two ladies, and a more dissimilar quartet would be hard to imagine. Lottie's and Rose's husbands are played by Alfred Molino and Jim Broadbent, and all four are excellent. Joan Plowright and Polly Walker play the other two woman sharing the villa. Things get off to a rocky start and the ladies defend their turf and come to terms about who shall dominate whom. But the Italian April works its enchantment on them, and soon things go much better. Lottie decides to invite her husband to see if the magic can help them reconcile. Rose then writes to her husband to invite him. Then things get sticky. Jim Broadbent's character has been chasing Polly Walker's character unknown to Rose; Rose is being pursued by the owner of the villa. The resolution of the various threads is well done, and the ending is satisfying. If you like this movie, I recommend "Smiles of a Summer Night" and vice versa.
