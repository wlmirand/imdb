    Nice movie, stylish, atmospheric. The movie is about love, friendship, and it is believable. It's a rather typical crime story, the usual "italiano-money-mafia"-trash. Pathetic at that - most movies are about crime, pistols and violence. So it is hard to find a good one, 98% of these movies are just trash. But I really would like to give this one up to 10 points! Alas! There are more than three points of mistakes (I am aware of (and not really sober at that)) or obviously constructed and stupid twists. It is such a pity. I think someone in the future, let's say in the next 30 years, will cut this film anew, and we will have real fun. This film could be a classical movie, and I hope will be made into, but this version lacks of faith into the consumers. Why do every smart people in the business thinking all watchers are dumb?

    Those who seek out this film simply to see Gina Gershon and Jennifer Tilly entwined in sapphic bliss might be pleasantly surprised to discover that Bound is not just a good opportunity for an ogle but that it is actually a really good noir/pulp thrillerwell written, wonderfully directed, and brilliantly acted. The fact that the two female stars roll around together in the buff is just an added bonus. One of the most confident directorial debuts I have ever seen, Bound's writers/directors The Wachowski's employ all manner of subtle, stylish touches to tell their tale of two lesbians who decide to relieve the mafia of $2million dollars with shocking consequences. The result is not just tense, atmospheric and unpredictable, but visually arresting throughout as wellan accomplished work that deserves to be known for more than just its sexy bits. 8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.

    The best way to watch this picture is with the sound OFF. And no subtitles, either. The "steamy" lesbian sex scene (with body doubles for the closeups) is topped by hundreds of offerings available every day on the today's internet. The script is **dumb**, clich&eacute;-ridden with not one memorable line in the whole film, and more four-letter profanity than "The Sopranos". It was clearly written not just in a rush but by Hollywood types who have little idea of what Mafia guys really are like or how they operate. The portrayals of Caesar and the rest are grotesquely unconvincing. Nor does it stop there. The butch ex-con Corky also is more caricature than character--just a collection of tattoos and piercings in men's underwear that never adds up to a believable person. OK, the cinematography and sets are stylish. The producers got the most from a low budget with no money for outdoor scenes so it's **film noir** in color. So what? Gina Gershon never got a part again in a major movie after appearing in this **dreck**. Even if every queer in the western world gave this picture ten stars on here, Hollywood, like the viewing public, made its own decision and this picture was gone from theaters--those few it ran in--faster than a late night movie crowd.

    This one starts out fairly amusing and cool because of the stylish elements. And since it has Gina Gershon in her prime as this tough and yet hot lesbian with a nude scene. But despite that as this movie progressed I just quickly started to lose interest, maybe about 40 minutes in. The plot is about these two lesbians trying to steal from the mafia and one of the two lesbian is one of the mafia members girl named Violet(Jennifer Tilly). Who I just couldn't stand, Jennifer Tilly is good at playing these slightly ditsy character but I just could never get used to her voice. And the other a tough and yet hot ex-con who works as a painter and a plumber named Corky. And the mafia guy who they are trying to steal from is a guy named Caesar(Joe Pantoliano). Joe Pantoliano will also star in another role as Cypher which is a role that he will most likely be known for throughout his career. This is one of those movies about the girls overcoming the guys and staying stronger, which is fine. But it's done is a predictable and dull manner. I was expecting few curve balls but it just goes in a very predictable direction. During some scenes it just has way too much of a perfect timing to the point it becomes just plain out silly and ridiculous and this happens multiple times throughout this movie. Also none of the characters are likable in this movie. Corky is a ex-con by choice and Violet is just a mafia guy's girl that is just unsatisfied. She wasn't abused or anything like that and claims she just couldn't stand being with a man that breaks the law and stuff and yet goes along with a ex-con instead. But that just seemed like a excuse because she is a lesbian. Sure Corky is less malicious compared to Caesar but just couldn't sympathize with any of the character. And sure Caesar is the bad guy of this story but he just didn't seem all that sadistic or evil and seemed to actually love Violet. Anyways when it comes down to it I didn't find any of the character likable. Sure you don't need likable characters in a movie for it to be a good or even great. But there just wasn't any characteristics or traits that made any of the characters stand out. It's just has bad people stealing from even badder people. Which can also work but not in this case. It's a alright directorial debut from the Wachowski's but nothing all that special. At least the Wachowski's directed a revolutionary film right after this one. And personally I think Gina Gershon would have been a better Trinity. 6.6/10

    Gina Gershon, Jennifer Tilly, Joe Pantoliano, John P. Ryan, and a very young Christopher Meloni star in "Bound," a 1996 film written and directed by the Wachowskis. Violet (Tilly) is the girlfriend of mobster Caesar (Pantoliano) meets a woman, Corky (Gershon) working as a plumber in their building. The two become lovers, and Violet talks Corky into helping her steal 2 million dollars from Caesar, who is holding the money and will turn it over to the big boss, Gino. The women set Caesar up to take the fall for the loss of the money. It doesn't go quite as planned. Violent, suspenseful, and tense, Bound is a real nail-biter. And I swear I've never heard such dramatic music in a film. It all goes toward setting up a nerve-wracking atmosphere. Violet is very sexy and does a great job as a mob girlfriend who knows her way around. Gershon is smart and tough as Corky. Someone made the comment that the two women didn't seem as in love as they should have been. I think there was a strong sexual attraction, and Violet saw a way out, and Corky, who has been in prison, was attracted to the money. The two have a passion for one another, but it's possible that neither one of them is capable of a deep, true love. Violet has been living with a man she doesn't care about -- she cares about Corky as much as she can, but I think she's a cool customer. Highly recommended if your nerves can stand it and if you don't mind all the violence. This is a very stylish film in the noir tradition.

    The Wachowskis are best known as the directors of The Matrix Trilogy. But before they were allowed to direct the first great movie and the so-so sequels they had to prove they were capable as directors. To do this they made a neo-noir small thriller, Bound: which resulted with us getting a very entertaining film. Corky (Gina Gershon) is an ex-convict who is hired to refurbish an apartment. Next door is a Mafia money launder, Caesar (Joe Pantoliano) and his girlfriend Violet (Jennifer Tilly). But Corky quickly finds out that Violet is really a lesbian and two have an affair. They see a opportunity to steal $2 Million from the Mafia and make Caesar the fall guy. But as the plan to put into action it starts to unravel and people start to die. Bound was a low budget film with a small cast and of a minimum of locations. It was a film that had to be driven by the characters and the plot and Wachowskis gave us taut and stylist experience. Bound has a neo-noir, postmodern style throughout as the plot twists and turns as the women's have to react to the changing situation. The Wachowskis were able to make the film ooze out tension and sexual energy throughout as they make get use of the limited sets as the characters can hear what is going on in the other apartment. Bound has all the visual flair you would expect from the directors of The Matrix and it was filled with flashy tricks: highlighted by fluid camera moves, fantastic editing and perfectly placed camera positions. It was perfectly paced film and the editing make scenes follow together seamlessly. There are many moments and shots that's has striking similarities to The Matrix. Because of the crime story and much of the character moments and dialogue Bound felt very much like an early Quentin Tarantino film, particular Reservoir Dogs and Jackie Brown. They share similar styles and both Jackie Brown and Bound focusing on minor criminals and outsiders who plan to screw over a major criminal figure. Those films focus on a simple crime stories but are focused on the characters have a noir feel to them. Bound is an excellent film, a tight thriller that uses every moment of screenplay to great effect. The Wachowskis showed what they are capable of and ended up making an even better film.

    Bound is written and directed by Andrew and Larry Wachowski. It stars Jennifer Tilly, Gina Gershon, Joe Pantoliano, John P. Ryan and Christopher Meloni. Music is scored by Don Davis and cinematography by Bill Pope. Plot finds Violet (Tilly) and Corky (Gershon) as two newly acquainted lovers who plot to steal $2 million of mob money from Violet's boyfriend, Caesar (Pantoliano). Quite a directorial debut from The Wachowski Brothers, a stylised neo-noir of considerable substance. Where once was man and woman treading the dark paths in film noir's halcyon days, now glides two women, lovers in cahoots, deadly femmes. The beauty of it all is that the lesbian lovers twist is no gimmick, it adds a dangerous quality to the narrative, the coupling is sexy but tender, a pair of gals who are very easy to root for, with extra tension wrung out by the slick characterisations. Both gals have been "bound" by ties in the preceding five years, Corky by way of doing a stretch in prison, let down by a former lover, and Violet in a restrictive relationship with Caesar. As the two come together, trust and betrayal are delicately perched on the see-saw, which way will it tilt? Much has been made of the sex scene between Corky and Violet that drives the plotting forward, but it would be a shame if Bound is only remembered for this scene. There is no titillation here, no grubby top shelf leanings, it's wonderfully sexy for sure, but natural passion rules the day, a believable union that underpins the drama. How nice, too, to find that in amongst the smouldering story the Wachowski's don't take a lazy option with the character of Caesar. It would have been so easy to just write him as a hapless dupe being spun to his doom by the femmes, but he no idiot, he's brainy and brawny, if the gals are to get away with their plan then they will have to work real hard to succeed. This keeps the narrative true, a rare treat since many other 90s thrillers fail to do so. With the dialogue pinging and Pope's cinematography sharp, tech aspects score high, with the brothers showing some deft visual touches along the way (the blood and paint finale especially is a real cracker). But none of it would impact the way it does without the trio of great performances from the leads. Tilly is slinky and kinky, a Monroesque creation, Gershon goes method, all brooding with intensity, and Pantoliano handles superbly the shift from calm mob launderer to frantic stooge. Great performances doing justice to the rich characterisations on the page. There's a slight irritant that we could have gone a touch deeper with Corky's past, while Meloni's loose cannon is too by the numbers, but they are minor blots on an otherwise terrific neo-noir landscape. 9/10

    Notorious for its lesbian scenes and the sexy female leads, this debut for the Matrix Directors is a naughty little neonoir that comes close, but does not attain minor classic status. A good looking film that showcases some visual flair but, the claustrophobic low budget is somehow not utilized for ultimate effect and the male characters are not edgy enough to penetrate these strong, luscious women. Joey Pants is great but just can't satisfy against such demanding, delicious dykes. A very good thriller that could be a bit more imaginative and little less lazy.

    Whichever critical or analytical angle you look at Bound by the Wachowski brothers, it is a film that is quite successful in each realm it chooses to represent. The film spans across the lesbian and thriller genre, which in part may have contributed to the film's widely acclaimed success upon release in the late nineties. Bound's ability to fluctuate beautifully between genres enhances the film's appeal, but perhaps the more critical film viewer felt as if Bound was less of a thriller, and more of a tale of prohibited romance between Corky (Gina Gershon) and Violet (Jennifer Tilly). It is in this way, as a lesbian film, that I wish to discuss elements of the film. The film's title itself represents a double meaning. To be bound to something, unable to be free or obtain a more personal self-freedom, is a defining factor in the film. In a heteronormative society that functions on social stereotypes and condemnable taboos, lesbian romance is literally bound to social constructionism. This is a pessimistic view of the film, but still remains to be a defining element in any "controversial" film to be considered and evaluated. Other than social normativity as a restriction for Corky and Violet's relationship, Violet's mobster boyfriend Caesar acts as a physical and mental barrier for Violet. Violet is bound to Caesar and the "business" in which he deals. She struggles to escape from his grip. In the first half of the film where Caesar's character is not present, Corky and Violet are able to flourish together in his absence. Yet, his presence becomes inherently violent and threatening whenever Violet stresses that she will leave him. Violet is unable to fulfill this promise without Corky. The more positive aspect to the film's title is that the Wachowski brothers reinforce a positive future for Corky and Violet. They are bound to one another, and are bound to escape (together) a dark, violent, and restrictive world forced upon them by Caesar and his mobster affiliates. While previously restrictive elements jeopardized their romantic relationship (not to mention getting away with the $2 million), Corky and Violet were predestined or bound to have a life together. Caesar, the mobsters, or the two lone, prison-like apartments in the film are unable to break this bond between Corky and Violet that can be seen in the very beginning of their journey. Gershon and Tilly function together brilliantly on screen, channeling just the right amount of sexual tension in a precisely calculated situation requiring trust, a vital element to any relationship. Gershon first appears to be rather fluid in her sexuality, at certain points the filmmakers seem to imply this ambiguous sexuality in her character. As viewers, we assume she is attracted to both men and women, even though we never see her interact sexually or flirtatiously with a man. Even in the bar scene, Gershon seeks out a female companion for the night but is denied by outside influences (the cop). Gershon's physically referred to as a "dike" or the embodiment of the masculine female. On the other hand, Tilly is quite the opposite, but finds Gershon's character to be enticingly attractive. Perhaps the seemingly heterosexual Violet seeks the thrill of being with Corky because it is "forbidden" in her reality to venture outside Caesar's apartment and out of his bed. Despite how initial attraction was conceived, Corky and Violet's romance is evidence of a heroic effort to overcome external forces that would otherwise criticize and scrutinize a romance such as theirs, which is ultimately more successful than any heterosexual relationship seen in the film.

    Wow. This one definitely caught me off-guard. Written and directed by the more than talented Wachowski brothers (creators of 'The Matrix') who were nothing but creative-minded college dropouts in their 20s in 1997, 'Bound' is a brilliant example of how they could convince the world of their unique ability to create unusual scenes. Take the story for example: A lesbian ex con, Corky (Gina Gershon) is hired to work as a plumber in an apartment, right next door to Violet (Jennifer Tilly) and her mobster boyfriend, Caesar (Joe Pantoliano). The initial attraction between the two women soon turns into a passionate affair, and the two decide to set Caesar up by stealing $2 million from the Mafia. The plan works smoothly up until Caesar reacts in an unexpected manner. I must admit that at first I was a little disappointed to see Corky and Violent embark in an affair so early into the movie, because I was afraid this piece would be yet another example portraying lesbian relationships solely consisting of near-pornographic encounters between strangers. However, later on it becomes evident that the two women are not only drawn to each other due to sexual attraction, they are bound by something beyond that. Perhaps it is the recognition that they are not as different as they appear to be; Corky being the sexy slim tomboy type, while Violent representing the epitome of curvaceous femininity a'la Betty Boop. Though it is set somewhere in the 90s, it displays characteristic film noir traits, which also gives a great opportunity for unique directions. I loved the way the Wachowski brothers managed to jump from one scene and time to the other without much problem, or show what the characters were thinking without using words, or focus on an object (such as a pistol) before zooming out onto the bigger scene. They also managed to make the sex scenes very intense without being overly pornographic. That is the kind of directing I treasure, as it does not allow the viewer to divert their attention. The acting was impeccable. Both Gershon and Tilly did a wonderful job, every little detail of their characters seemed to make sense in the greater picture. Pantoliano was seemingly born to do the role of Caesar, and he aptly displayed the mobster's paranoia and moments of weakness, along with the cruelty that goes with the job. This movie is definitely a nail-biter that will keep you wondering what's next. It is remarkable that it shows women in a powerful position especially in contrast to the Mafia. This one will definitely keep you bound to the screen.

    The Wachowskis are best known as the directors of The Matrix Trilogy. But before they were allowed to direct the first great movie and the so-so sequels they had to prove they were capable as directors. To do this they made a neo-noir small thriller, Bound: which resulted with us getting a very entertaining film. Corky (Gina Gershon) is an ex-convict who is hired to refurbish an apartment. Next door is a Mafia money launder, Caesar (Joe Pantoliano) and his girlfriend Violet (Jennifer Tilly). But Corky quickly finds out that Violet is really a lesbian and two have an affair. They see a opportunity to steal $2 Million from the Mafia and make Caesar the fall guy. But as the plan to put into action it starts to unravel and people start to die. Bound was a low budget film with a small cast and of a minimum of locations. It was a film that had to be driven by the characters and the plot and Wachowskis gave us taut and stylist experience. Bound has a neo-noir, postmodern style throughout as the plot twists and turns as the women's have to react to the changing situation. The Wachowskis were able to make the film ooze out tension and sexual energy throughout as they make get use of the limited sets as the characters can hear what is going on in the other apartment. Bound has all the visual flair you would expect from the directors of The Matrix and it was filled with flashy tricks: highlighted by fluid camera moves, fantastic editing and perfectly placed camera positions. It was perfectly paced film and the editing make scenes follow together seamlessly. There are many moments and shots that's has striking similarities to The Matrix. Because of the crime story and much of the character moments and dialogue Bound felt very much like an early Quentin Tarantino film, particular Reservoir Dogs and Jackie Brown. They share similar styles and both Jackie Brown and Bound focusing on minor criminals and outsiders who plan to screw over a major criminal figure. Those films focus on a simple crime stories but are focused on the characters have a noir feel to them. Bound is an excellent film, a tight thriller that uses every moment of screenplay to great effect. The Wachowskis showed what they are capable of and ended up making an even better film.

    Bound is written and directed by Andrew and Larry Wachowski. It stars Jennifer Tilly, Gina Gershon, Joe Pantoliano, John P. Ryan and Christopher Meloni. Music is scored by Don Davis and cinematography by Bill Pope. Plot finds Violet (Tilly) and Corky (Gershon) as two newly acquainted lovers who plot to steal $2 million of mob money from Violet's boyfriend, Caesar (Pantoliano). Quite a directorial debut from The Wachowski Brothers, a stylised neo-noir of considerable substance. Where once was man and woman treading the dark paths in film noir's halcyon days, now glides two women, lovers in cahoots, deadly femmes. The beauty of it all is that the lesbian lovers twist is no gimmick, it adds a dangerous quality to the narrative, the coupling is sexy but tender, a pair of gals who are very easy to root for, with extra tension wrung out by the slick characterisations. Both gals have been "bound" by ties in the preceding five years, Corky by way of doing a stretch in prison, let down by a former lover, and Violet in a restrictive relationship with Caesar. As the two come together, trust and betrayal are delicately perched on the see-saw, which way will it tilt? Much has been made of the sex scene between Corky and Violet that drives the plotting forward, but it would be a shame if Bound is only remembered for this scene. There is no titillation here, no grubby top shelf leanings, it's wonderfully sexy for sure, but natural passion rules the day, a believable union that underpins the drama. How nice, too, to find that in amongst the smouldering story the Wachowski's don't take a lazy option with the character of Caesar. It would have been so easy to just write him as a hapless dupe being spun to his doom by the femmes, but he no idiot, he's brainy and brawny, if the gals are to get away with their plan then they will have to work real hard to succeed. This keeps the narrative true, a rare treat since many other 90s thrillers fail to do so. With the dialogue pinging and Pope's cinematography sharp, tech aspects score high, with the brothers showing some deft visual touches along the way (the blood and paint finale especially is a real cracker). But none of it would impact the way it does without the trio of great performances from the leads. Tilly is slinky and kinky, a Monroesque creation, Gershon goes method, all brooding with intensity, and Pantoliano handles superbly the shift from calm mob launderer to frantic stooge. Great performances doing justice to the rich characterisations on the page. There's a slight irritant that we could have gone a touch deeper with Corky's past, while Meloni's loose cannon is too by the numbers, but they are minor blots on an otherwise terrific neo-noir landscape. 9/10

    Notorious for its lesbian scenes and the sexy female leads, this debut for the Matrix Directors is a naughty little neonoir that comes close, but does not attain minor classic status. A good looking film that showcases some visual flair but, the claustrophobic low budget is somehow not utilized for ultimate effect and the male characters are not edgy enough to penetrate these strong, luscious women. Joey Pants is great but just can't satisfy against such demanding, delicious dykes. A very good thriller that could be a bit more imaginative and little less lazy.

    Whichever critical or analytical angle you look at Bound by the Wachowski brothers, it is a film that is quite successful in each realm it chooses to represent. The film spans across the lesbian and thriller genre, which in part may have contributed to the film's widely acclaimed success upon release in the late nineties. Bound's ability to fluctuate beautifully between genres enhances the film's appeal, but perhaps the more critical film viewer felt as if Bound was less of a thriller, and more of a tale of prohibited romance between Corky (Gina Gershon) and Violet (Jennifer Tilly). It is in this way, as a lesbian film, that I wish to discuss elements of the film. The film's title itself represents a double meaning. To be bound to something, unable to be free or obtain a more personal self-freedom, is a defining factor in the film. In a heteronormative society that functions on social stereotypes and condemnable taboos, lesbian romance is literally bound to social constructionism. This is a pessimistic view of the film, but still remains to be a defining element in any "controversial" film to be considered and evaluated. Other than social normativity as a restriction for Corky and Violet's relationship, Violet's mobster boyfriend Caesar acts as a physical and mental barrier for Violet. Violet is bound to Caesar and the "business" in which he deals. She struggles to escape from his grip. In the first half of the film where Caesar's character is not present, Corky and Violet are able to flourish together in his absence. Yet, his presence becomes inherently violent and threatening whenever Violet stresses that she will leave him. Violet is unable to fulfill this promise without Corky. The more positive aspect to the film's title is that the Wachowski brothers reinforce a positive future for Corky and Violet. They are bound to one another, and are bound to escape (together) a dark, violent, and restrictive world forced upon them by Caesar and his mobster affiliates. While previously restrictive elements jeopardized their romantic relationship (not to mention getting away with the $2 million), Corky and Violet were predestined or bound to have a life together. Caesar, the mobsters, or the two lone, prison-like apartments in the film are unable to break this bond between Corky and Violet that can be seen in the very beginning of their journey. Gershon and Tilly function together brilliantly on screen, channeling just the right amount of sexual tension in a precisely calculated situation requiring trust, a vital element to any relationship. Gershon first appears to be rather fluid in her sexuality, at certain points the filmmakers seem to imply this ambiguous sexuality in her character. As viewers, we assume she is attracted to both men and women, even though we never see her interact sexually or flirtatiously with a man. Even in the bar scene, Gershon seeks out a female companion for the night but is denied by outside influences (the cop). Gershon's physically referred to as a "dike" or the embodiment of the masculine female. On the other hand, Tilly is quite the opposite, but finds Gershon's character to be enticingly attractive. Perhaps the seemingly heterosexual Violet seeks the thrill of being with Corky because it is "forbidden" in her reality to venture outside Caesar's apartment and out of his bed. Despite how initial attraction was conceived, Corky and Violet's romance is evidence of a heroic effort to overcome external forces that would otherwise criticize and scrutinize a romance such as theirs, which is ultimately more successful than any heterosexual relationship seen in the film.

    Wow. This one definitely caught me off-guard. Written and directed by the more than talented Wachowski brothers (creators of 'The Matrix') who were nothing but creative-minded college dropouts in their 20s in 1997, 'Bound' is a brilliant example of how they could convince the world of their unique ability to create unusual scenes. Take the story for example: A lesbian ex con, Corky (Gina Gershon) is hired to work as a plumber in an apartment, right next door to Violet (Jennifer Tilly) and her mobster boyfriend, Caesar (Joe Pantoliano). The initial attraction between the two women soon turns into a passionate affair, and the two decide to set Caesar up by stealing $2 million from the Mafia. The plan works smoothly up until Caesar reacts in an unexpected manner. I must admit that at first I was a little disappointed to see Corky and Violent embark in an affair so early into the movie, because I was afraid this piece would be yet another example portraying lesbian relationships solely consisting of near-pornographic encounters between strangers. However, later on it becomes evident that the two women are not only drawn to each other due to sexual attraction, they are bound by something beyond that. Perhaps it is the recognition that they are not as different as they appear to be; Corky being the sexy slim tomboy type, while Violent representing the epitome of curvaceous femininity a'la Betty Boop. Though it is set somewhere in the 90s, it displays characteristic film noir traits, which also gives a great opportunity for unique directions. I loved the way the Wachowski brothers managed to jump from one scene and time to the other without much problem, or show what the characters were thinking without using words, or focus on an object (such as a pistol) before zooming out onto the bigger scene. They also managed to make the sex scenes very intense without being overly pornographic. That is the kind of directing I treasure, as it does not allow the viewer to divert their attention. The acting was impeccable. Both Gershon and Tilly did a wonderful job, every little detail of their characters seemed to make sense in the greater picture. Pantoliano was seemingly born to do the role of Caesar, and he aptly displayed the mobster's paranoia and moments of weakness, along with the cruelty that goes with the job. This movie is definitely a nail-biter that will keep you wondering what's next. It is remarkable that it shows women in a powerful position especially in contrast to the Mafia. This one will definitely keep you bound to the screen.

    Nice movie, stylish, atmospheric. The movie is about love, friendship, and it is believable. It's a rather typical crime story, the usual "italiano-money-mafia"-trash. Pathetic at that - most movies are about crime, pistols and violence. So it is hard to find a good one, 98% of these movies are just trash. But I really would like to give this one up to 10 points! Alas! There are more than three points of mistakes (I am aware of (and not really sober at that)) or obviously constructed and stupid twists. It is such a pity. I think someone in the future, let's say in the next 30 years, will cut this film anew, and we will have real fun. This film could be a classical movie, and I hope will be made into, but this version lacks of faith into the consumers. Why do every smart people in the business thinking all watchers are dumb?

    Those who seek out this film simply to see Gina Gershon and Jennifer Tilly entwined in sapphic bliss might be pleasantly surprised to discover that Bound is not just a good opportunity for an ogle but that it is actually a really good noir/pulp thrillerwell written, wonderfully directed, and brilliantly acted. The fact that the two female stars roll around together in the buff is just an added bonus. One of the most confident directorial debuts I have ever seen, Bound's writers/directors The Wachowski's employ all manner of subtle, stylish touches to tell their tale of two lesbians who decide to relieve the mafia of $2million dollars with shocking consequences. The result is not just tense, atmospheric and unpredictable, but visually arresting throughout as wellan accomplished work that deserves to be known for more than just its sexy bits. 8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.

    The best way to watch this picture is with the sound OFF. And no subtitles, either. The "steamy" lesbian sex scene (with body doubles for the closeups) is topped by hundreds of offerings available every day on the today's internet. The script is **dumb**, clich&eacute;-ridden with not one memorable line in the whole film, and more four-letter profanity than "The Sopranos". It was clearly written not just in a rush but by Hollywood types who have little idea of what Mafia guys really are like or how they operate. The portrayals of Caesar and the rest are grotesquely unconvincing. Nor does it stop there. The butch ex-con Corky also is more caricature than character--just a collection of tattoos and piercings in men's underwear that never adds up to a believable person. OK, the cinematography and sets are stylish. The producers got the most from a low budget with no money for outdoor scenes so it's **film noir** in color. So what? Gina Gershon never got a part again in a major movie after appearing in this **dreck**. Even if every queer in the western world gave this picture ten stars on here, Hollywood, like the viewing public, made its own decision and this picture was gone from theaters--those few it ran in--faster than a late night movie crowd.

    This one starts out fairly amusing and cool because of the stylish elements. And since it has Gina Gershon in her prime as this tough and yet hot lesbian with a nude scene. But despite that as this movie progressed I just quickly started to lose interest, maybe about 40 minutes in. The plot is about these two lesbians trying to steal from the mafia and one of the two lesbian is one of the mafia members girl named Violet(Jennifer Tilly). Who I just couldn't stand, Jennifer Tilly is good at playing these slightly ditsy character but I just could never get used to her voice. And the other a tough and yet hot ex-con who works as a painter and a plumber named Corky. And the mafia guy who they are trying to steal from is a guy named Caesar(Joe Pantoliano). Joe Pantoliano will also star in another role as Cypher which is a role that he will most likely be known for throughout his career. This is one of those movies about the girls overcoming the guys and staying stronger, which is fine. But it's done is a predictable and dull manner. I was expecting few curve balls but it just goes in a very predictable direction. During some scenes it just has way too much of a perfect timing to the point it becomes just plain out silly and ridiculous and this happens multiple times throughout this movie. Also none of the characters are likable in this movie. Corky is a ex-con by choice and Violet is just a mafia guy's girl that is just unsatisfied. She wasn't abused or anything like that and claims she just couldn't stand being with a man that breaks the law and stuff and yet goes along with a ex-con instead. But that just seemed like a excuse because she is a lesbian. Sure Corky is less malicious compared to Caesar but just couldn't sympathize with any of the character. And sure Caesar is the bad guy of this story but he just didn't seem all that sadistic or evil and seemed to actually love Violet. Anyways when it comes down to it I didn't find any of the character likable. Sure you don't need likable characters in a movie for it to be a good or even great. But there just wasn't any characteristics or traits that made any of the characters stand out. It's just has bad people stealing from even badder people. Which can also work but not in this case. It's a alright directorial debut from the Wachowski's but nothing all that special. At least the Wachowski's directed a revolutionary film right after this one. And personally I think Gina Gershon would have been a better Trinity. 6.6/10

    Gina Gershon, Jennifer Tilly, Joe Pantoliano, John P. Ryan, and a very young Christopher Meloni star in "Bound," a 1996 film written and directed by the Wachowskis. Violet (Tilly) is the girlfriend of mobster Caesar (Pantoliano) meets a woman, Corky (Gershon) working as a plumber in their building. The two become lovers, and Violet talks Corky into helping her steal 2 million dollars from Caesar, who is holding the money and will turn it over to the big boss, Gino. The women set Caesar up to take the fall for the loss of the money. It doesn't go quite as planned. Violent, suspenseful, and tense, Bound is a real nail-biter. And I swear I've never heard such dramatic music in a film. It all goes toward setting up a nerve-wracking atmosphere. Violet is very sexy and does a great job as a mob girlfriend who knows her way around. Gershon is smart and tough as Corky. Someone made the comment that the two women didn't seem as in love as they should have been. I think there was a strong sexual attraction, and Violet saw a way out, and Corky, who has been in prison, was attracted to the money. The two have a passion for one another, but it's possible that neither one of them is capable of a deep, true love. Violet has been living with a man she doesn't care about -- she cares about Corky as much as she can, but I think she's a cool customer. Highly recommended if your nerves can stand it and if you don't mind all the violence. This is a very stylish film in the noir tradition.

Perhaps it is the recognition that they are not as different as they appear to be; Corky being the sexy slim tomboy type, while Violent representing the epitome of curvaceous femininity a'la Betty Boop. Though it is set somewhere in the 90s, it displays characteristic film noir traits, which also gives a great opportunity for unique directions. I loved the way the Wachowski brothers managed to jump from one scene and time to the other without much problem, or show what the characters were thinking without using words, or focus on an object (such as a pistol) before zooming out onto the bigger scene. They also managed to make the sex scenes very intense without being overly pornographic. That is the kind of directing I treasure, as it does not allow the viewer to divert their attention. The acting was impeccable. Both Gershon and Tilly did a wonderful job, every little detail of their characters seemed to make sense in the greater picture. Pantoliano was seemingly born to do the role of Caesar, and he aptly displayed the mobster's paranoia and moments of weakness, along with the cruelty that goes with the job. This movie is definitely a nail-biter that will keep you wondering what's next. It is remarkable that it shows women in a powerful position especially in contrast to the Mafia. This one will definitely keep you bound to the screen.

    Nice movie, stylish, atmospheric. The movie is about love, friendship, and it is believable. It's a rather typical crime story, the usual "italiano-money-mafia"-trash. Pathetic at that - most movies are about crime, pistols and violence. So it is hard to find a good one, 98% of these movies are just trash. But I really would like to give this one up to 10 points! Alas! There are more than three points of mistakes (I am aware of (and not really sober at that)) or obviously constructed and stupid twists. It is such a pity. I think someone in the future, let's say in the next 30 years, will cut this film anew, and we will have real fun. This film could be a classical movie, and I hope will be made into, but this version lacks of faith into the consumers. Why do every smart people in the business thinking all watchers are dumb?

    Those who seek out this film simply to see Gina Gershon and Jennifer Tilly entwined in sapphic bliss might be pleasantly surprised to discover that Bound is not just a good opportunity for an ogle but that it is actually a really good noir/pulp thrillerwell written, wonderfully directed, and brilliantly acted. The fact that the two female stars roll around together in the buff is just an added bonus. One of the most confident directorial debuts I have ever seen, Bound's writers/directors The Wachowski's employ all manner of subtle, stylish touches to tell their tale of two lesbians who decide to relieve the mafia of $2million dollars with shocking consequences. The result is not just tense, atmospheric and unpredictable, but visually arresting throughout as wellan accomplished work that deserves to be known for more than just its sexy bits. 8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.

    The best way to watch this picture is with the sound OFF. And no subtitles, either. The "steamy" lesbian sex scene (with body doubles for the closeups) is topped by hundreds of offerings available every day on the today's internet. The script is **dumb**, clich&eacute;-ridden with not one memorable line in the whole film, and more four-letter profanity than "The Sopranos". It was clearly written not just in a rush but by Hollywood types who have little idea of what Mafia guys really are like or how they operate. The portrayals of Caesar and the rest are grotesquely unconvincing. Nor does it stop there. The butch ex-con Corky also is more caricature than character--just a collection of tattoos and piercings in men's underwear that never adds up to a believable person. OK, the cinematography and sets are stylish. The producers got the most from a low budget with no money for outdoor scenes so it's **film noir** in color. So what? Gina Gershon never got a part again in a major movie after appearing in this **dreck**. Even if every queer in the western world gave this picture ten stars on here, Hollywood, like the viewing public, made its own decision and this picture was gone from theaters--those few it ran in--faster than a late night movie crowd.

    This one starts out fairly amusing and cool because of the stylish elements. And since it has Gina Gershon in her prime as this tough and yet hot lesbian with a nude scene. But despite that as this movie progressed I just quickly started to lose interest, maybe about 40 minutes in. The plot is about these two lesbians trying to steal from the mafia and one of the two lesbian is one of the mafia members girl named Violet(Jennifer Tilly). Who I just couldn't stand, Jennifer Tilly is good at playing these slightly ditsy character but I just could never get used to her voice. And the other a tough and yet hot ex-con who works as a painter and a plumber named Corky. And the mafia guy who they are trying to steal from is a guy named Caesar(Joe Pantoliano). Joe Pantoliano will also star in another role as Cypher which is a role that he will most likely be known for throughout his career. This is one of those movies about the girls overcoming the guys and staying stronger, which is fine. But it's done is a predictable and dull manner. I was expecting few curve balls but it just goes in a very predictable direction. During some scenes it just has way too much of a perfect timing to the point it becomes just plain out silly and ridiculous and this happens multiple times throughout this movie. Also none of the characters are likable in this movie. Corky is a ex-con by choice and Violet is just a mafia guy's girl that is just unsatisfied. She wasn't abused or anything like that and claims she just couldn't stand being with a man that breaks the law and stuff and yet goes along with a ex-con instead. But that just seemed like a excuse because she is a lesbian. Sure Corky is less malicious compared to Caesar but just couldn't sympathize with any of the character. And sure Caesar is the bad guy of this story but he just didn't seem all that sadistic or evil and seemed to actually love Violet. Anyways when it comes down to it I didn't find any of the character likable. Sure you don't need likable characters in a movie for it to be a good or even great. But there just wasn't any characteristics or traits that made any of the characters stand out. It's just has bad people stealing from even badder people. Which can also work but not in this case. It's a alright directorial debut from the Wachowski's but nothing all that special. At least the Wachowski's directed a revolutionary film right after this one. And personally I think Gina Gershon would have been a better Trinity. 6.6/10

    Gina Gershon, Jennifer Tilly, Joe Pantoliano, John P. Ryan, and a very young Christopher Meloni star in "Bound," a 1996 film written and directed by the Wachowskis. Violet (Tilly) is the girlfriend of mobster Caesar (Pantoliano) meets a woman, Corky (Gershon) working as a plumber in their building. The two become lovers, and Violet talks Corky into helping her steal 2 million dollars from Caesar, who is holding the money and will turn it over to the big boss, Gino. The women set Caesar up to take the fall for the loss of the money. It doesn't go quite as planned. Violent, suspenseful, and tense, Bound is a real nail-biter. And I swear I've never heard such dramatic music in a film. It all goes toward setting up a nerve-wracking atmosphere. Violet is very sexy and does a great job as a mob girlfriend who knows her way around. Gershon is smart and tough as Corky. Someone made the comment that the two women didn't seem as in love as they should have been. I think there was a strong sexual attraction, and Violet saw a way out, and Corky, who has been in prison, was attracted to the money. The two have a passion for one another, but it's possible that neither one of them is capable of a deep, true love. Violet has been living with a man she doesn't care about -- she cares about Corky as much as she can, but I think she's a cool customer. Highly recommended if your nerves can stand it and if you don't mind all the violence. This is a very stylish film in the noir tradition.

    The Wachowskis are best known as the directors of The Matrix Trilogy. But before they were allowed to direct the first great movie and the so-so sequels they had to prove they were capable as directors. To do this they made a neo-noir small thriller, Bound: which resulted with us getting a very entertaining film. Corky (Gina Gershon) is an ex-convict who is hired to refurbish an apartment. Next door is a Mafia money launder, Caesar (Joe Pantoliano) and his girlfriend Violet (Jennifer Tilly). But Corky quickly finds out that Violet is really a lesbian and two have an affair. They see a opportunity to steal $2 Million from the Mafia and make Caesar the fall guy. But as the plan to put into action it starts to unravel and people start to die. Bound was a low budget film with a small cast and of a minimum of locations. It was a film that had to be driven by the characters and the plot and Wachowskis gave us taut and stylist experience. Bound has a neo-noir, postmodern style throughout as the plot twists and turns as the women's have to react to the changing situation. The Wachowskis were able to make the film ooze out tension and sexual energy throughout as they make get use of the limited sets as the characters can hear what is going on in the other apartment. Bound has all the visual flair you would expect from the directors of The Matrix and it was filled with flashy tricks: highlighted by fluid camera moves, fantastic editing and perfectly placed camera positions. It was perfectly paced film and the editing make scenes follow together seamlessly. There are many moments and shots that's has striking similarities to The Matrix. Because of the crime story and much of the character moments and dialogue Bound felt very much like an early Quentin Tarantino film, particular Reservoir Dogs and Jackie Brown. They share similar styles and both Jackie Brown and Bound focusing on minor criminals and outsiders who plan to screw over a major criminal figure. Those films focus on a simple crime stories but are focused on the characters have a noir feel to them. Bound is an excellent film, a tight thriller that uses every moment of screenplay to great effect. The Wachowskis showed what they are capable of and ended up making an even better film.

    Bound is written and directed by Andrew and Larry Wachowski. It stars Jennifer Tilly, Gina Gershon, Joe Pantoliano, John P. Ryan and Christopher Meloni. Music is scored by Don Davis and cinematography by Bill Pope. Plot finds Violet (Tilly) and Corky (Gershon) as two newly acquainted lovers who plot to steal $2 million of mob money from Violet's boyfriend, Caesar (Pantoliano). Quite a directorial debut from The Wachowski Brothers, a stylised neo-noir of considerable substance. Where once was man and woman treading the dark paths in film noir's halcyon days, now glides two women, lovers in cahoots, deadly femmes. The beauty of it all is that the lesbian lovers twist is no gimmick, it adds a dangerous quality to the narrative, the coupling is sexy but tender, a pair of gals who are very easy to root for, with extra tension wrung out by the slick characterisations. Both gals have been "bound" by ties in the preceding five years, Corky by way of doing a stretch in prison, let down by a former lover, and Violet in a restrictive relationship with Caesar. As the two come together, trust and betrayal are delicately perched on the see-saw, which way will it tilt? Much has been made of the sex scene between Corky and Violet that drives the plotting forward, but it would be a shame if Bound is only remembered for this scene. There is no titillation here, no grubby top shelf leanings, it's wonderfully sexy for sure, but natural passion rules the day, a believable union that underpins the drama. How nice, too, to find that in amongst the smouldering story the Wachowski's don't take a lazy option with the character of Caesar. It would have been so easy to just write him as a hapless dupe being spun to his doom by the femmes, but he no idiot, he's brainy and brawny, if the gals are to get away with their plan then they will have to work real hard to succeed. This keeps the narrative true, a rare treat since many other 90s thrillers fail to do so. With the dialogue pinging and Pope's cinematography sharp, tech aspects score high, with the brothers showing some deft visual touches along the way (the blood and paint finale especially is a real cracker). But none of it would impact the way it does without the trio of great performances from the leads. Tilly is slinky and kinky, a Monroesque creation, Gershon goes method, all brooding with intensity, and Pantoliano handles superbly the shift from calm mob launderer to frantic stooge. Great performances doing justice to the rich characterisations on the page. There's a slight irritant that we could have gone a touch deeper with Corky's past, while Meloni's loose cannon is too by the numbers, but they are minor blots on an otherwise terrific neo-noir landscape. 9/10

    Notorious for its lesbian scenes and the sexy female leads, this debut for the Matrix Directors is a naughty little neonoir that comes close, but does not attain minor classic status. A good looking film that showcases some visual flair but, the claustrophobic low budget is somehow not utilized for ultimate effect and the male characters are not edgy enough to penetrate these strong, luscious women. Joey Pants is great but just can't satisfy against such demanding, delicious dykes. A very good thriller that could be a bit more imaginative and little less lazy.

    Whichever critical or analytical angle you look at Bound by the Wachowski brothers, it is a film that is quite successful in each realm it chooses to represent. The film spans across the lesbian and thriller genre, which in part may have contributed to the film's widely acclaimed success upon release in the late nineties. Bound's ability to fluctuate beautifully between genres enhances the film's appeal, but perhaps the more critical film viewer felt as if Bound was less of a thriller, and more of a tale of prohibited romance between Corky (Gina Gershon) and Violet (Jennifer Tilly). It is in this way, as a lesbian film, that I wish to discuss elements of the film. The film's title itself represents a double meaning. To be bound to something, unable to be free or obtain a more personal self-freedom, is a defining factor in the film. In a heteronormative society that functions on social stereotypes and condemnable taboos, lesbian romance is literally bound to social constructionism. This is a pessimistic view of the film, but still remains to be a defining element in any "controversial" film to be considered and evaluated. Other than social normativity as a restriction for Corky and Violet's relationship, Violet's mobster boyfriend Caesar acts as a physical and mental barrier for Violet. Violet is bound to Caesar and the "business" in which he deals. She struggles to escape from his grip. In the first half of the film where Caesar's character is not present, Corky and Violet are able to flourish together in his absence. Yet, his presence becomes inherently violent and threatening whenever Violet stresses that she will leave him. Violet is unable to fulfill this promise without Corky. The more positive aspect to the film's title is that the Wachowski brothers reinforce a positive future for Corky and Violet. They are bound to one another, and are bound to escape (together) a dark, violent, and restrictive world forced upon them by Caesar and his mobster affiliates. While previously restrictive elements jeopardized their romantic relationship (not to mention getting away with the $2 million), Corky and Violet were predestined or bound to have a life together. Caesar, the mobsters, or the two lone, prison-like apartments in the film are unable to break this bond between Corky and Violet that can be seen in the very beginning of their journey. Gershon and Tilly function together brilliantly on screen, channeling just the right amount of sexual tension in a precisely calculated situation requiring trust, a vital element to any relationship. Gershon first appears to be rather fluid in her sexuality, at certain points the filmmakers seem to imply this ambiguous sexuality in her character. As viewers, we assume she is attracted to both men and women, even though we never see her interact sexually or flirtatiously with a man. Even in the bar scene, Gershon seeks out a female companion for the night but is denied by outside influences (the cop). Gershon's physically referred to as a "dike" or the embodiment of the masculine female. On the other hand, Tilly is quite the opposite, but finds Gershon's character to be enticingly attractive. Perhaps the seemingly heterosexual Violet seeks the thrill of being with Corky because it is "forbidden" in her reality to venture outside Caesar's apartment and out of his bed. Despite how initial attraction was conceived, Corky and Violet's romance is evidence of a heroic effort to overcome external forces that would otherwise criticize and scrutinize a romance such as theirs, which is ultimately more successful than any heterosexual relationship seen in the film.

    Wow. This one definitely caught me off-guard. Written and directed by the more than talented Wachowski brothers (creators of 'The Matrix') who were nothing but creative-minded college dropouts in their 20s in 1997, 'Bound' is a brilliant example of how they could convince the world of their unique ability to create unusual scenes. Take the story for example: A lesbian ex con, Corky (Gina Gershon) is hired to work as a plumber in an apartment, right next door to Violet (Jennifer Tilly) and her mobster boyfriend, Caesar (Joe Pantoliano). The initial attraction between the two women soon turns into a passionate affair, and the two decide to set Caesar up by stealing $2 million from the Mafia. The plan works smoothly up until Caesar reacts in an unexpected manner. I must admit that at first I was a little disappointed to see Corky and Violent embark in an affair so early into the movie, because I was afraid this piece would be yet another example portraying lesbian relationships solely consisting of near-pornographic encounters between strangers. However, later on it becomes evident that the two women are not only drawn to each other due to sexual attraction, they are bound by something beyond that. Perhaps it is the recognition that they are not as different as they appear to be; Corky being the sexy slim tomboy type, while Violent representing the epitome of curvaceous femininity a'la Betty Boop.

They see a opportunity to steal $2 Million from the Mafia and make Caesar the fall guy. But as the plan to put into action it starts to unravel and people start to die. Bound was a low budget film with a small cast and of a minimum of locations. It was a film that had to be driven by the characters and the plot and Wachowskis gave us taut and stylist experience. Bound has a neo-noir, postmodern style throughout as the plot twists and turns as the women's have to react to the changing situation. The Wachowskis were able to make the film ooze out tension and sexual energy throughout as they make get use of the limited sets as the characters can hear what is going on in the other apartment. Bound has all the visual flair you would expect from the directors of The Matrix and it was filled with flashy tricks: highlighted by fluid camera moves, fantastic editing and perfectly placed camera positions. It was perfectly paced film and the editing make scenes follow together seamlessly. There are many moments and shots that's has striking similarities to The Matrix. Because of the crime story and much of the character moments and dialogue Bound felt very much like an early Quentin Tarantino film, particular Reservoir Dogs and Jackie Brown. They share similar styles and both Jackie Brown and Bound focusing on minor criminals and outsiders who plan to screw over a major criminal figure. Those films focus on a simple crime stories but are focused on the characters have a noir feel to them. Bound is an excellent film, a tight thriller that uses every moment of screenplay to great effect. The Wachowskis showed what they are capable of and ended up making an even better film.

    Bound is written and directed by Andrew and Larry Wachowski. It stars Jennifer Tilly, Gina Gershon, Joe Pantoliano, John P. Ryan and Christopher Meloni. Music is scored by Don Davis and cinematography by Bill Pope. Plot finds Violet (Tilly) and Corky (Gershon) as two newly acquainted lovers who plot to steal $2 million of mob money from Violet's boyfriend, Caesar (Pantoliano). Quite a directorial debut from The Wachowski Brothers, a stylised neo-noir of considerable substance. Where once was man and woman treading the dark paths in film noir's halcyon days, now glides two women, lovers in cahoots, deadly femmes. The beauty of it all is that the lesbian lovers twist is no gimmick, it adds a dangerous quality to the narrative, the coupling is sexy but tender, a pair of gals who are very easy to root for, with extra tension wrung out by the slick characterisations. Both gals have been "bound" by ties in the preceding five years, Corky by way of doing a stretch in prison, let down by a former lover, and Violet in a restrictive relationship with Caesar. As the two come together, trust and betrayal are delicately perched on the see-saw, which way will it tilt? Much has been made of the sex scene between Corky and Violet that drives the plotting forward, but it would be a shame if Bound is only remembered for this scene. There is no titillation here, no grubby top shelf leanings, it's wonderfully sexy for sure, but natural passion rules the day, a believable union that underpins the drama. How nice, too, to find that in amongst the smouldering story the Wachowski's don't take a lazy option with the character of Caesar. It would have been so easy to just write him as a hapless dupe being spun to his doom by the femmes, but he no idiot, he's brainy and brawny, if the gals are to get away with their plan then they will have to work real hard to succeed. This keeps the narrative true, a rare treat since many other 90s thrillers fail to do so. With the dialogue pinging and Pope's cinematography sharp, tech aspects score high, with the brothers showing some deft visual touches along the way (the blood and paint finale especially is a real cracker). But none of it would impact the way it does without the trio of great performances from the leads. Tilly is slinky and kinky, a Monroesque creation, Gershon goes method, all brooding with intensity, and Pantoliano handles superbly the shift from calm mob launderer to frantic stooge. Great performances doing justice to the rich characterisations on the page. There's a slight irritant that we could have gone a touch deeper with Corky's past, while Meloni's loose cannon is too by the numbers, but they are minor blots on an otherwise terrific neo-noir landscape. 9/10

    Notorious for its lesbian scenes and the sexy female leads, this debut for the Matrix Directors is a naughty little neonoir that comes close, but does not attain minor classic status. A good looking film that showcases some visual flair but, the claustrophobic low budget is somehow not utilized for ultimate effect and the male characters are not edgy enough to penetrate these strong, luscious women. Joey Pants is great but just can't satisfy against such demanding, delicious dykes. A very good thriller that could be a bit more imaginative and little less lazy.

    Whichever critical or analytical angle you look at Bound by the Wachowski brothers, it is a film that is quite successful in each realm it chooses to represent. The film spans across the lesbian and thriller genre, which in part may have contributed to the film's widely acclaimed success upon release in the late nineties. Bound's ability to fluctuate beautifully between genres enhances the film's appeal, but perhaps the more critical film viewer felt as if Bound was less of a thriller, and more of a tale of prohibited romance between Corky (Gina Gershon) and Violet (Jennifer Tilly). It is in this way, as a lesbian film, that I wish to discuss elements of the film. The film's title itself represents a double meaning. To be bound to something, unable to be free or obtain a more personal self-freedom, is a defining factor in the film. In a heteronormative society that functions on social stereotypes and condemnable taboos, lesbian romance is literally bound to social constructionism. This is a pessimistic view of the film, but still remains to be a defining element in any "controversial" film to be considered and evaluated. Other than social normativity as a restriction for Corky and Violet's relationship, Violet's mobster boyfriend Caesar acts as a physical and mental barrier for Violet. Violet is bound to Caesar and the "business" in which he deals. She struggles to escape from his grip. In the first half of the film where Caesar's character is not present, Corky and Violet are able to flourish together in his absence. Yet, his presence becomes inherently violent and threatening whenever Violet stresses that she will leave him. Violet is unable to fulfill this promise without Corky. The more positive aspect to the film's title is that the Wachowski brothers reinforce a positive future for Corky and Violet. They are bound to one another, and are bound to escape (together) a dark, violent, and restrictive world forced upon them by Caesar and his mobster affiliates. While previously restrictive elements jeopardized their romantic relationship (not to mention getting away with the $2 million), Corky and Violet were predestined or bound to have a life together. Caesar, the mobsters, or the two lone, prison-like apartments in the film are unable to break this bond between Corky and Violet that can be seen in the very beginning of their journey. Gershon and Tilly function together brilliantly on screen, channeling just the right amount of sexual tension in a precisely calculated situation requiring trust, a vital element to any relationship. Gershon first appears to be rather fluid in her sexuality, at certain points the filmmakers seem to imply this ambiguous sexuality in her character. As viewers, we assume she is attracted to both men and women, even though we never see her interact sexually or flirtatiously with a man. Even in the bar scene, Gershon seeks out a female companion for the night but is denied by outside influences (the cop). Gershon's physically referred to as a "dike" or the embodiment of the masculine female. On the other hand, Tilly is quite the opposite, but finds Gershon's character to be enticingly attractive. Perhaps the seemingly heterosexual Violet seeks the thrill of being with Corky because it is "forbidden" in her reality to venture outside Caesar's apartment and out of his bed. Despite how initial attraction was conceived, Corky and Violet's romance is evidence of a heroic effort to overcome external forces that would otherwise criticize and scrutinize a romance such as theirs, which is ultimately more successful than any heterosexual relationship seen in the film.

    Wow. This one definitely caught me off-guard. Written and directed by the more than talented Wachowski brothers (creators of 'The Matrix') who were nothing but creative-minded college dropouts in their 20s in 1997, 'Bound' is a brilliant example of how they could convince the world of their unique ability to create unusual scenes. Take the story for example: A lesbian ex con, Corky (Gina Gershon) is hired to work as a plumber in an apartment, right next door to Violet (Jennifer Tilly) and her mobster boyfriend, Caesar (Joe Pantoliano). The initial attraction between the two women soon turns into a passionate affair, and the two decide to set Caesar up by stealing $2 million from the Mafia. The plan works smoothly up until Caesar reacts in an unexpected manner. I must admit that at first I was a little disappointed to see Corky and Violent embark in an affair so early into the movie, because I was afraid this piece would be yet another example portraying lesbian relationships solely consisting of near-pornographic encounters between strangers. However, later on it becomes evident that the two women are not only drawn to each other due to sexual attraction, they are bound by something beyond that. Perhaps it is the recognition that they are not as different as they appear to be; Corky being the sexy slim tomboy type, while Violent representing the epitome of curvaceous femininity a'la Betty Boop. Though it is set somewhere in the 90s, it displays characteristic film noir traits, which also gives a great opportunity for unique directions. I loved the way the Wachowski brothers managed to jump from one scene and time to the other without much problem, or show what the characters were thinking without using words, or focus on an object (such as a pistol) before zooming out onto the bigger scene. They also managed to make the sex scenes very intense without being overly pornographic. That is the kind of directing I treasure, as it does not allow the viewer to divert their attention. The acting was impeccable. Both Gershon and Tilly did a wonderful job, every little detail of their characters seemed to make sense in the greater picture. Pantoliano was seemingly born to do the role of Caesar, and he aptly displayed the mobster's paranoia and moments of weakness, along with the cruelty that goes with the job. This movie is definitely a nail-biter that will keep you wondering what's next. It is remarkable that it shows women in a powerful position especially in contrast to the Mafia. This one will definitely keep you bound to the screen.

    Nice movie, stylish, atmospheric. The movie is about love, friendship, and it is believable. It's a rather typical crime story, the usual "italiano-money-mafia"-trash. Pathetic at that - most movies are about crime, pistols and violence. So it is hard to find a good one, 98% of these movies are just trash. But I really would like to give this one up to 10 points! Alas! There are more than three points of mistakes (I am aware of (and not really sober at that)) or obviously constructed and stupid twists. It is such a pity. I think someone in the future, let's say in the next 30 years, will cut this film anew, and we will have real fun. This film could be a classical movie, and I hope will be made into, but this version lacks of faith into the consumers. Why do every smart people in the business thinking all watchers are dumb?

    Those who seek out this film simply to see Gina Gershon and Jennifer Tilly entwined in sapphic bliss might be pleasantly surprised to discover that Bound is not just a good opportunity for an ogle but that it is actually a really good noir/pulp thrillerwell written, wonderfully directed, and brilliantly acted. The fact that the two female stars roll around together in the buff is just an added bonus. One of the most confident directorial debuts I have ever seen, Bound's writers/directors The Wachowski's employ all manner of subtle, stylish touches to tell their tale of two lesbians who decide to relieve the mafia of $2million dollars with shocking consequences. The result is not just tense, atmospheric and unpredictable, but visually arresting throughout as wellan accomplished work that deserves to be known for more than just its sexy bits. 8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.

    The best way to watch this picture is with the sound OFF. And no subtitles, either. The "steamy" lesbian sex scene (with body doubles for the closeups) is topped by hundreds of offerings available every day on the today's internet. The script is **dumb**, clich&eacute;-ridden with not one memorable line in the whole film, and more four-letter profanity than "The Sopranos". It was clearly written not just in a rush but by Hollywood types who have little idea of what Mafia guys really are like or how they operate. The portrayals of Caesar and the rest are grotesquely unconvincing. Nor does it stop there. The butch ex-con Corky also is more caricature than character--just a collection of tattoos and piercings in men's underwear that never adds up to a believable person. OK, the cinematography and sets are stylish. The producers got the most from a low budget with no money for outdoor scenes so it's **film noir** in color. So what? Gina Gershon never got a part again in a major movie after appearing in this **dreck**. Even if every queer in the western world gave this picture ten stars on here, Hollywood, like the viewing public, made its own decision and this picture was gone from theaters--those few it ran in--faster than a late night movie crowd.

    This one starts out fairly amusing and cool because of the stylish elements. And since it has Gina Gershon in her prime as this tough and yet hot lesbian with a nude scene. But despite that as this movie progressed I just quickly started to lose interest, maybe about 40 minutes in. The plot is about these two lesbians trying to steal from the mafia and one of the two lesbian is one of the mafia members girl named Violet(Jennifer Tilly). Who I just couldn't stand, Jennifer Tilly is good at playing these slightly ditsy character but I just could never get used to her voice. And the other a tough and yet hot ex-con who works as a painter and a plumber named Corky. And the mafia guy who they are trying to steal from is a guy named Caesar(Joe Pantoliano). Joe Pantoliano will also star in another role as Cypher which is a role that he will most likely be known for throughout his career. This is one of those movies about the girls overcoming the guys and staying stronger, which is fine. But it's done is a predictable and dull manner. I was expecting few curve balls but it just goes in a very predictable direction. During some scenes it just has way too much of a perfect timing to the point it becomes just plain out silly and ridiculous and this happens multiple times throughout this movie. Also none of the characters are likable in this movie. Corky is a ex-con by choice and Violet is just a mafia guy's girl that is just unsatisfied. She wasn't abused or anything like that and claims she just couldn't stand being with a man that breaks the law and stuff and yet goes along with a ex-con instead. But that just seemed like a excuse because she is a lesbian. Sure Corky is less malicious compared to Caesar but just couldn't sympathize with any of the character. And sure Caesar is the bad guy of this story but he just didn't seem all that sadistic or evil and seemed to actually love Violet. Anyways when it comes down to it I didn't find any of the character likable. Sure you don't need likable characters in a movie for it to be a good or even great. But there just wasn't any characteristics or traits that made any of the characters stand out. It's just has bad people stealing from even badder people. Which can also work but not in this case. It's a alright directorial debut from the Wachowski's but nothing all that special. At least the Wachowski's directed a revolutionary film right after this one. And personally I think Gina Gershon would have been a better Trinity. 6.6/10

    Gina Gershon, Jennifer Tilly, Joe Pantoliano, John P. Ryan, and a very young Christopher Meloni star in "Bound," a 1996 film written and directed by the Wachowskis. Violet (Tilly) is the girlfriend of mobster Caesar (Pantoliano) meets a woman, Corky (Gershon) working as a plumber in their building. The two become lovers, and Violet talks Corky into helping her steal 2 million dollars from Caesar, who is holding the money and will turn it over to the big boss, Gino. The women set Caesar up to take the fall for the loss of the money. It doesn't go quite as planned. Violent, suspenseful, and tense, Bound is a real nail-biter. And I swear I've never heard such dramatic music in a film. It all goes toward setting up a nerve-wracking atmosphere. Violet is very sexy and does a great job as a mob girlfriend who knows her way around. Gershon is smart and tough as Corky. Someone made the comment that the two women didn't seem as in love as they should have been. I think there was a strong sexual attraction, and Violet saw a way out, and Corky, who has been in prison, was attracted to the money. The two have a passion for one another, but it's possible that neither one of them is capable of a deep, true love. Violet has been living with a man she doesn't care about -- she cares about Corky as much as she can, but I think she's a cool customer. Highly recommended if your nerves can stand it and if you don't mind all the violence. This is a very stylish film in the noir tradition.

They also managed to make the sex scenes very intense without being overly pornographic. That is the kind of directing I treasure, as it does not allow the viewer to divert their attention. The acting was impeccable. Both Gershon and Tilly did a wonderful job, every little detail of their characters seemed to make sense in the greater picture. Pantoliano was seemingly born to do the role of Caesar, and he aptly displayed the mobster's paranoia and moments of weakness, along with the cruelty that goes with the job. This movie is definitely a nail-biter that will keep you wondering what's next. It is remarkable that it shows women in a powerful position especially in contrast to the Mafia. This one will definitely keep you bound to the screen.

    Nice movie, stylish, atmospheric. The movie is about love, friendship, and it is believable. It's a rather typical crime story, the usual "italiano-money-mafia"-trash. Pathetic at that - most movies are about crime, pistols and violence. So it is hard to find a good one, 98% of these movies are just trash. But I really would like to give this one up to 10 points! Alas! There are more than three points of mistakes (I am aware of (and not really sober at that)) or obviously constructed and stupid twists. It is such a pity. I think someone in the future, let's say in the next 30 years, will cut this film anew, and we will have real fun. This film could be a classical movie, and I hope will be made into, but this version lacks of faith into the consumers. Why do every smart people in the business thinking all watchers are dumb?

    Those who seek out this film simply to see Gina Gershon and Jennifer Tilly entwined in sapphic bliss might be pleasantly surprised to discover that Bound is not just a good opportunity for an ogle but that it is actually a really good noir/pulp thrillerwell written, wonderfully directed, and brilliantly acted. The fact that the two female stars roll around together in the buff is just an added bonus. One of the most confident directorial debuts I have ever seen, Bound's writers/directors The Wachowski's employ all manner of subtle, stylish touches to tell their tale of two lesbians who decide to relieve the mafia of $2million dollars with shocking consequences. The result is not just tense, atmospheric and unpredictable, but visually arresting throughout as wellan accomplished work that deserves to be known for more than just its sexy bits. 8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.

    The best way to watch this picture is with the sound OFF. And no subtitles, either. The "steamy" lesbian sex scene (with body doubles for the closeups) is topped by hundreds of offerings available every day on the today's internet. The script is **dumb**, clich&eacute;-ridden with not one memorable line in the whole film, and more four-letter profanity than "The Sopranos". It was clearly written not just in a rush but by Hollywood types who have little idea of what Mafia guys really are like or how they operate. The portrayals of Caesar and the rest are grotesquely unconvincing. Nor does it stop there. The butch ex-con Corky also is more caricature than character--just a collection of tattoos and piercings in men's underwear that never adds up to a believable person. OK, the cinematography and sets are stylish. The producers got the most from a low budget with no money for outdoor scenes so it's **film noir** in color. So what? Gina Gershon never got a part again in a major movie after appearing in this **dreck**. Even if every queer in the western world gave this picture ten stars on here, Hollywood, like the viewing public, made its own decision and this picture was gone from theaters--those few it ran in--faster than a late night movie crowd.

    This one starts out fairly amusing and cool because of the stylish elements. And since it has Gina Gershon in her prime as this tough and yet hot lesbian with a nude scene. But despite that as this movie progressed I just quickly started to lose interest, maybe about 40 minutes in. The plot is about these two lesbians trying to steal from the mafia and one of the two lesbian is one of the mafia members girl named Violet(Jennifer Tilly). Who I just couldn't stand, Jennifer Tilly is good at playing these slightly ditsy character but I just could never get used to her voice. And the other a tough and yet hot ex-con who works as a painter and a plumber named Corky. And the mafia guy who they are trying to steal from is a guy named Caesar(Joe Pantoliano). Joe Pantoliano will also star in another role as Cypher which is a role that he will most likely be known for throughout his career. This is one of those movies about the girls overcoming the guys and staying stronger, which is fine. But it's done is a predictable and dull manner. I was expecting few curve balls but it just goes in a very predictable direction. During some scenes it just has way too much of a perfect timing to the point it becomes just plain out silly and ridiculous and this happens multiple times throughout this movie. Also none of the characters are likable in this movie. Corky is a ex-con by choice and Violet is just a mafia guy's girl that is just unsatisfied. She wasn't abused or anything like that and claims she just couldn't stand being with a man that breaks the law and stuff and yet goes along with a ex-con instead. But that just seemed like a excuse because she is a lesbian. Sure Corky is less malicious compared to Caesar but just couldn't sympathize with any of the character. And sure Caesar is the bad guy of this story but he just didn't seem all that sadistic or evil and seemed to actually love Violet. Anyways when it comes down to it I didn't find any of the character likable. Sure you don't need likable characters in a movie for it to be a good or even great. But there just wasn't any characteristics or traits that made any of the characters stand out. It's just has bad people stealing from even badder people. Which can also work but not in this case. It's a alright directorial debut from the Wachowski's but nothing all that special. At least the Wachowski's directed a revolutionary film right after this one. And personally I think Gina Gershon would have been a better Trinity. 6.6/10

    Gina Gershon, Jennifer Tilly, Joe Pantoliano, John P. Ryan, and a very young Christopher Meloni star in "Bound," a 1996 film written and directed by the Wachowskis. Violet (Tilly) is the girlfriend of mobster Caesar (Pantoliano) meets a woman, Corky (Gershon) working as a plumber in their building. The two become lovers, and Violet talks Corky into helping her steal 2 million dollars from Caesar, who is holding the money and will turn it over to the big boss, Gino. The women set Caesar up to take the fall for the loss of the money. It doesn't go quite as planned. Violent, suspenseful, and tense, Bound is a real nail-biter. And I swear I've never heard such dramatic music in a film. It all goes toward setting up a nerve-wracking atmosphere. Violet is very sexy and does a great job as a mob girlfriend who knows her way around. Gershon is smart and tough as Corky. Someone made the comment that the two women didn't seem as in love as they should have been. I think there was a strong sexual attraction, and Violet saw a way out, and Corky, who has been in prison, was attracted to the money. The two have a passion for one another, but it's possible that neither one of them is capable of a deep, true love. Violet has been living with a man she doesn't care about -- she cares about Corky as much as she can, but I think she's a cool customer. Highly recommended if your nerves can stand it and if you don't mind all the violence. This is a very stylish film in the noir tradition.

    The Wachowskis are best known as the directors of The Matrix Trilogy. But before they were allowed to direct the first great movie and the so-so sequels they had to prove they were capable as directors. To do this they made a neo-noir small thriller, Bound: which resulted with us getting a very entertaining film. Corky (Gina Gershon) is an ex-convict who is hired to refurbish an apartment. Next door is a Mafia money launder, Caesar (Joe Pantoliano) and his girlfriend Violet (Jennifer Tilly). But Corky quickly finds out that Violet is really a lesbian and two have an affair. They see a opportunity to steal $2 Million from the Mafia and make Caesar the fall guy. But as the plan to put into action it starts to unravel and people start to die. Bound was a low budget film with a small cast and of a minimum of locations. It was a film that had to be driven by the characters and the plot and Wachowskis gave us taut and stylist experience. Bound has a neo-noir, postmodern style throughout as the plot twists and turns as the women's have to react to the changing situation. The Wachowskis were able to make the film ooze out tension and sexual energy throughout as they make get use of the limited sets as the characters can hear what is going on in the other apartment. Bound has all the visual flair you would expect from the directors of The Matrix and it was filled with flashy tricks: highlighted by fluid camera moves, fantastic editing and perfectly placed camera positions. It was perfectly paced film and the editing make scenes follow together seamlessly. There are many moments and shots that's has striking similarities to The Matrix. Because of the crime story and much of the character moments and dialogue Bound felt very much like an early Quentin Tarantino film, particular Reservoir Dogs and Jackie Brown. They share similar styles and both Jackie Brown and Bound focusing on minor criminals and outsiders who plan to screw over a major criminal figure. Those films focus on a simple crime stories but are focused on the characters have a noir feel to them. Bound is an excellent film, a tight thriller that uses every moment of screenplay to great effect. The Wachowskis showed what they are capable of and ended up making an even better film.

    Bound is written and directed by Andrew and Larry Wachowski. It stars Jennifer Tilly, Gina Gershon, Joe Pantoliano, John P. Ryan and Christopher Meloni. Music is scored by Don Davis and cinematography by Bill Pope. Plot finds Violet (Tilly) and Corky (Gershon) as two newly acquainted lovers who plot to steal $2 million of mob money from Violet's boyfriend, Caesar (Pantoliano). Quite a directorial debut from The Wachowski Brothers, a stylised neo-noir of considerable substance. Where once was man and woman treading the dark paths in film noir's halcyon days, now glides two women, lovers in cahoots, deadly femmes. The beauty of it all is that the lesbian lovers twist is no gimmick, it adds a dangerous quality to the narrative, the coupling is sexy but tender, a pair of gals who are very easy to root for, with extra tension wrung out by the slick characterisations. Both gals have been "bound" by ties in the preceding five years, Corky by way of doing a stretch in prison, let down by a former lover, and Violet in a restrictive relationship with Caesar. As the two come together, trust and betrayal are delicately perched on the see-saw, which way will it tilt? Much has been made of the sex scene between Corky and Violet that drives the plotting forward, but it would be a shame if Bound is only remembered for this scene. There is no titillation here, no grubby top shelf leanings, it's wonderfully sexy for sure, but natural passion rules the day, a believable union that underpins the drama. How nice, too, to find that in amongst the smouldering story the Wachowski's don't take a lazy option with the character of Caesar. It would have been so easy to just write him as a hapless dupe being spun to his doom by the femmes, but he no idiot, he's brainy and brawny, if the gals are to get away with their plan then they will have to work real hard to succeed. This keeps the narrative true, a rare treat since many other 90s thrillers fail to do so. With the dialogue pinging and Pope's cinematography sharp, tech aspects score high, with the brothers showing some deft visual touches along the way (the blood and paint finale especially is a real cracker). But none of it would impact the way it does without the trio of great performances from the leads. Tilly is slinky and kinky, a Monroesque creation, Gershon goes method, all brooding with intensity, and Pantoliano handles superbly the shift from calm mob launderer to frantic stooge. Great performances doing justice to the rich characterisations on the page. There's a slight irritant that we could have gone a touch deeper with Corky's past, while Meloni's loose cannon is too by the numbers, but they are minor blots on an otherwise terrific neo-noir landscape. 9/10

    Notorious for its lesbian scenes and the sexy female leads, this debut for the Matrix Directors is a naughty little neonoir that comes close, but does not attain minor classic status. A good looking film that showcases some visual flair but, the claustrophobic low budget is somehow not utilized for ultimate effect and the male characters are not edgy enough to penetrate these strong, luscious women. Joey Pants is great but just can't satisfy against such demanding, delicious dykes. A very good thriller that could be a bit more imaginative and little less lazy.

    Whichever critical or analytical angle you look at Bound by the Wachowski brothers, it is a film that is quite successful in each realm it chooses to represent. The film spans across the lesbian and thriller genre, which in part may have contributed to the film's widely acclaimed success upon release in the late nineties. Bound's ability to fluctuate beautifully between genres enhances the film's appeal, but perhaps the more critical film viewer felt as if Bound was less of a thriller, and more of a tale of prohibited romance between Corky (Gina Gershon) and Violet (Jennifer Tilly). It is in this way, as a lesbian film, that I wish to discuss elements of the film. The film's title itself represents a double meaning. To be bound to something, unable to be free or obtain a more personal self-freedom, is a defining factor in the film. In a heteronormative society that functions on social stereotypes and condemnable taboos, lesbian romance is literally bound to social constructionism. This is a pessimistic view of the film, but still remains to be a defining element in any "controversial" film to be considered and evaluated. Other than social normativity as a restriction for Corky and Violet's relationship, Violet's mobster boyfriend Caesar acts as a physical and mental barrier for Violet. Violet is bound to Caesar and the "business" in which he deals. She struggles to escape from his grip. In the first half of the film where Caesar's character is not present, Corky and Violet are able to flourish together in his absence. Yet, his presence becomes inherently violent and threatening whenever Violet stresses that she will leave him. Violet is unable to fulfill this promise without Corky. The more positive aspect to the film's title is that the Wachowski brothers reinforce a positive future for Corky and Violet. They are bound to one another, and are bound to escape (together) a dark, violent, and restrictive world forced upon them by Caesar and his mobster affiliates. While previously restrictive elements jeopardized their romantic relationship (not to mention getting away with the $2 million), Corky and Violet were predestined or bound to have a life together. Caesar, the mobsters, or the two lone, prison-like apartments in the film are unable to break this bond between Corky and Violet that can be seen in the very beginning of their journey. Gershon and Tilly function together brilliantly on screen, channeling just the right amount of sexual tension in a precisely calculated situation requiring trust, a vital element to any relationship. Gershon first appears to be rather fluid in her sexuality, at certain points the filmmakers seem to imply this ambiguous sexuality in her character. As viewers, we assume she is attracted to both men and women, even though we never see her interact sexually or flirtatiously with a man. Even in the bar scene, Gershon seeks out a female companion for the night but is denied by outside influences (the cop). Gershon's physically referred to as a "dike" or the embodiment of the masculine female. On the other hand, Tilly is quite the opposite, but finds Gershon's character to be enticingly attractive. Perhaps the seemingly heterosexual Violet seeks the thrill of being with Corky because it is "forbidden" in her reality to venture outside Caesar's apartment and out of his bed. Despite how initial attraction was conceived, Corky and Violet's romance is evidence of a heroic effort to overcome external forces that would otherwise criticize and scrutinize a romance such as theirs, which is ultimately more successful than any heterosexual relationship seen in the film.

    Wow. This one definitely caught me off-guard. Written and directed by the more than talented Wachowski brothers (creators of 'The Matrix') who were nothing but creative-minded college dropouts in their 20s in 1997, 'Bound' is a brilliant example of how they could convince the world of their unique ability to create unusual scenes. Take the story for example: A lesbian ex con, Corky (Gina Gershon) is hired to work as a plumber in an apartment, right next door to Violet (Jennifer Tilly) and her mobster boyfriend, Caesar (Joe Pantoliano). The initial attraction between the two women soon turns into a passionate affair, and the two decide to set Caesar up by stealing $2 million from the Mafia. The plan works smoothly up until Caesar reacts in an unexpected manner. I must admit that at first I was a little disappointed to see Corky and Violent embark in an affair so early into the movie, because I was afraid this piece would be yet another example portraying lesbian relationships solely consisting of near-pornographic encounters between strangers. However, later on it becomes evident that the two women are not only drawn to each other due to sexual attraction, they are bound by something beyond that. Perhaps it is the recognition that they are not as different as they appear to be; Corky being the sexy slim tomboy type, while Violent representing the epitome of curvaceous femininity a'la Betty Boop. Though it is set somewhere in the 90s, it displays characteristic film noir traits, which also gives a great opportunity for unique directions. I loved the way the Wachowski brothers managed to jump from one scene and time to the other without much problem, or show what the characters were thinking without using words, or focus on an object (such as a pistol) before zooming out onto the bigger scene. They also managed to make the sex scenes very intense without being overly pornographic. That is the kind of directing I treasure, as it does not allow the viewer to divert their attention.

Pantoliano was seemingly born to do the role of Caesar, and he aptly displayed the mobster's paranoia and moments of weakness, along with the cruelty that goes with the job. This movie is definitely a nail-biter that will keep you wondering what's next. It is remarkable that it shows women in a powerful position especially in contrast to the Mafia.

The Wachowskis were able to make the film ooze out tension and sexual energy throughout as they make get use of the limited sets as the characters can hear what is going on in the other apartment. Bound has all the visual flair you would expect from the directors of The Matrix and it was filled with flashy tricks: highlighted by fluid camera moves, fantastic editing and perfectly placed camera positions. It was perfectly paced film and the editing make scenes follow together seamlessly. There are many moments and shots that's has striking similarities to The Matrix. Because of the crime story and much of the character moments and dialogue Bound felt very much like an early Quentin Tarantino film, particular Reservoir Dogs and Jackie Brown. They share similar styles and both Jackie Brown and Bound focusing on minor criminals and outsiders who plan to screw over a major criminal figure. Those films focus on a simple crime stories but are focused on the characters have a noir feel to them. Bound is an excellent film, a tight thriller that uses every moment of screenplay to great effect. The Wachowskis showed what they are capable of and ended up making an even better film.

    Bound is written and directed by Andrew and Larry Wachowski. It stars Jennifer Tilly, Gina Gershon, Joe Pantoliano, John P. Ryan and Christopher Meloni. Music is scored by Don Davis and cinematography by Bill Pope. Plot finds Violet (Tilly) and Corky (Gershon) as two newly acquainted lovers who plot to steal $2 million of mob money from Violet's boyfriend, Caesar (Pantoliano). Quite a directorial debut from The Wachowski Brothers, a stylised neo-noir of considerable substance. Where once was man and woman treading the dark paths in film noir's halcyon days, now glides two women, lovers in cahoots, deadly femmes. The beauty of it all is that the lesbian lovers twist is no gimmick, it adds a dangerous quality to the narrative, the coupling is sexy but tender, a pair of gals who are very easy to root for, with extra tension wrung out by the slick characterisations. Both gals have been "bound" by ties in the preceding five years, Corky by way of doing a stretch in prison, let down by a former lover, and Violet in a restrictive relationship with Caesar. As the two come together, trust and betrayal are delicately perched on the see-saw, which way will it tilt? Much has been made of the sex scene between Corky and Violet that drives the plotting forward, but it would be a shame if Bound is only remembered for this scene. There is no titillation here, no grubby top shelf leanings, it's wonderfully sexy for sure, but natural passion rules the day, a believable union that underpins the drama. How nice, too, to find that in amongst the smouldering story the Wachowski's don't take a lazy option with the character of Caesar. It would have been so easy to just write him as a hapless dupe being spun to his doom by the femmes, but he no idiot, he's brainy and brawny, if the gals are to get away with their plan then they will have to work real hard to succeed. This keeps the narrative true, a rare treat since many other 90s thrillers fail to do so. With the dialogue pinging and Pope's cinematography sharp, tech aspects score high, with the brothers showing some deft visual touches along the way (the blood and paint finale especially is a real cracker). But none of it would impact the way it does without the trio of great performances from the leads. Tilly is slinky and kinky, a Monroesque creation, Gershon goes method, all brooding with intensity, and Pantoliano handles superbly the shift from calm mob launderer to frantic stooge. Great performances doing justice to the rich characterisations on the page. There's a slight irritant that we could have gone a touch deeper with Corky's past, while Meloni's loose cannon is too by the numbers, but they are minor blots on an otherwise terrific neo-noir landscape. 9/10

    Notorious for its lesbian scenes and the sexy female leads, this debut for the Matrix Directors is a naughty little neonoir that comes close, but does not attain minor classic status. A good looking film that showcases some visual flair but, the claustrophobic low budget is somehow not utilized for ultimate effect and the male characters are not edgy enough to penetrate these strong, luscious women. Joey Pants is great but just can't satisfy against such demanding, delicious dykes. A very good thriller that could be a bit more imaginative and little less lazy.

    Whichever critical or analytical angle you look at Bound by the Wachowski brothers, it is a film that is quite successful in each realm it chooses to represent. The film spans across the lesbian and thriller genre, which in part may have contributed to the film's widely acclaimed success upon release in the late nineties. Bound's ability to fluctuate beautifully between genres enhances the film's appeal, but perhaps the more critical film viewer felt as if Bound was less of a thriller, and more of a tale of prohibited romance between Corky (Gina Gershon) and Violet (Jennifer Tilly). It is in this way, as a lesbian film, that I wish to discuss elements of the film. The film's title itself represents a double meaning. To be bound to something, unable to be free or obtain a more personal self-freedom, is a defining factor in the film. In a heteronormative society that functions on social stereotypes and condemnable taboos, lesbian romance is literally bound to social constructionism. This is a pessimistic view of the film, but still remains to be a defining element in any "controversial" film to be considered and evaluated. Other than social normativity as a restriction for Corky and Violet's relationship, Violet's mobster boyfriend Caesar acts as a physical and mental barrier for Violet. Violet is bound to Caesar and the "business" in which he deals. She struggles to escape from his grip. In the first half of the film where Caesar's character is not present, Corky and Violet are able to flourish together in his absence. Yet, his presence becomes inherently violent and threatening whenever Violet stresses that she will leave him. Violet is unable to fulfill this promise without Corky. The more positive aspect to the film's title is that the Wachowski brothers reinforce a positive future for Corky and Violet. They are bound to one another, and are bound to escape (together) a dark, violent, and restrictive world forced upon them by Caesar and his mobster affiliates. While previously restrictive elements jeopardized their romantic relationship (not to mention getting away with the $2 million), Corky and Violet were predestined or bound to have a life together. Caesar, the mobsters, or the two lone, prison-like apartments in the film are unable to break this bond between Corky and Violet that can be seen in the very beginning of their journey. Gershon and Tilly function together brilliantly on screen, channeling just the right amount of sexual tension in a precisely calculated situation requiring trust, a vital element to any relationship. Gershon first appears to be rather fluid in her sexuality, at certain points the filmmakers seem to imply this ambiguous sexuality in her character. As viewers, we assume she is attracted to both men and women, even though we never see her interact sexually or flirtatiously with a man. Even in the bar scene, Gershon seeks out a female companion for the night but is denied by outside influences (the cop). Gershon's physically referred to as a "dike" or the embodiment of the masculine female. On the other hand, Tilly is quite the opposite, but finds Gershon's character to be enticingly attractive. Perhaps the seemingly heterosexual Violet seeks the thrill of being with Corky because it is "forbidden" in her reality to venture outside Caesar's apartment and out of his bed. Despite how initial attraction was conceived, Corky and Violet's romance is evidence of a heroic effort to overcome external forces that would otherwise criticize and scrutinize a romance such as theirs, which is ultimately more successful than any heterosexual relationship seen in the film.

    Wow. This one definitely caught me off-guard. Written and directed by the more than talented Wachowski brothers (creators of 'The Matrix') who were nothing but creative-minded college dropouts in their 20s in 1997, 'Bound' is a brilliant example of how they could convince the world of their unique ability to create unusual scenes. Take the story for example: A lesbian ex con, Corky (Gina Gershon) is hired to work as a plumber in an apartment, right next door to Violet (Jennifer Tilly) and her mobster boyfriend, Caesar (Joe Pantoliano). The initial attraction between the two women soon turns into a passionate affair, and the two decide to set Caesar up by stealing $2 million from the Mafia. The plan works smoothly up until Caesar reacts in an unexpected manner. I must admit that at first I was a little disappointed to see Corky and Violent embark in an affair so early into the movie, because I was afraid this piece would be yet another example portraying lesbian relationships solely consisting of near-pornographic encounters between strangers. However, later on it becomes evident that the two women are not only drawn to each other due to sexual attraction, they are bound by something beyond that. Perhaps it is the recognition that they are not as different as they appear to be; Corky being the sexy slim tomboy type, while Violent representing the epitome of curvaceous femininity a'la Betty Boop. Though it is set somewhere in the 90s, it displays characteristic film noir traits, which also gives a great opportunity for unique directions. I loved the way the Wachowski brothers managed to jump from one scene and time to the other without much problem, or show what the characters were thinking without using words, or focus on an object (such as a pistol) before zooming out onto the bigger scene. They also managed to make the sex scenes very intense without being overly pornographic. That is the kind of directing I treasure, as it does not allow the viewer to divert their attention. The acting was impeccable. Both Gershon and Tilly did a wonderful job, every little detail of their characters seemed to make sense in the greater picture. Pantoliano was seemingly born to do the role of Caesar, and he aptly displayed the mobster's paranoia and moments of weakness, along with the cruelty that goes with the job. This movie is definitely a nail-biter that will keep you wondering what's next. It is remarkable that it shows women in a powerful position especially in contrast to the Mafia. This one will definitely keep you bound to the screen.

    Nice movie, stylish, atmospheric. The movie is about love, friendship, and it is believable. It's a rather typical crime story, the usual "italiano-money-mafia"-trash. Pathetic at that - most movies are about crime, pistols and violence. So it is hard to find a good one, 98% of these movies are just trash. But I really would like to give this one up to 10 points! Alas! There are more than three points of mistakes (I am aware of (and not really sober at that)) or obviously constructed and stupid twists. It is such a pity. I think someone in the future, let's say in the next 30 years, will cut this film anew, and we will have real fun. This film could be a classical movie, and I hope will be made into, but this version lacks of faith into the consumers. Why do every smart people in the business thinking all watchers are dumb?

    Those who seek out this film simply to see Gina Gershon and Jennifer Tilly entwined in sapphic bliss might be pleasantly surprised to discover that Bound is not just a good opportunity for an ogle but that it is actually a really good noir/pulp thrillerwell written, wonderfully directed, and brilliantly acted. The fact that the two female stars roll around together in the buff is just an added bonus. One of the most confident directorial debuts I have ever seen, Bound's writers/directors The Wachowski's employ all manner of subtle, stylish touches to tell their tale of two lesbians who decide to relieve the mafia of $2million dollars with shocking consequences. The result is not just tense, atmospheric and unpredictable, but visually arresting throughout as wellan accomplished work that deserves to be known for more than just its sexy bits. 8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.

    The best way to watch this picture is with the sound OFF. And no subtitles, either. The "steamy" lesbian sex scene (with body doubles for the closeups) is topped by hundreds of offerings available every day on the today's internet. The script is **dumb**, clich&eacute;-ridden with not one memorable line in the whole film, and more four-letter profanity than "The Sopranos". It was clearly written not just in a rush but by Hollywood types who have little idea of what Mafia guys really are like or how they operate. The portrayals of Caesar and the rest are grotesquely unconvincing. Nor does it stop there. The butch ex-con Corky also is more caricature than character--just a collection of tattoos and piercings in men's underwear that never adds up to a believable person. OK, the cinematography and sets are stylish. The producers got the most from a low budget with no money for outdoor scenes so it's **film noir** in color. So what? Gina Gershon never got a part again in a major movie after appearing in this **dreck**. Even if every queer in the western world gave this picture ten stars on here, Hollywood, like the viewing public, made its own decision and this picture was gone from theaters--those few it ran in--faster than a late night movie crowd.

    This one starts out fairly amusing and cool because of the stylish elements. And since it has Gina Gershon in her prime as this tough and yet hot lesbian with a nude scene. But despite that as this movie progressed I just quickly started to lose interest, maybe about 40 minutes in. The plot is about these two lesbians trying to steal from the mafia and one of the two lesbian is one of the mafia members girl named Violet(Jennifer Tilly). Who I just couldn't stand, Jennifer Tilly is good at playing these slightly ditsy character but I just could never get used to her voice. And the other a tough and yet hot ex-con who works as a painter and a plumber named Corky. And the mafia guy who they are trying to steal from is a guy named Caesar(Joe Pantoliano). Joe Pantoliano will also star in another role as Cypher which is a role that he will most likely be known for throughout his career. This is one of those movies about the girls overcoming the guys and staying stronger, which is fine. But it's done is a predictable and dull manner. I was expecting few curve balls but it just goes in a very predictable direction. During some scenes it just has way too much of a perfect timing to the point it becomes just plain out silly and ridiculous and this happens multiple times throughout this movie. Also none of the characters are likable in this movie. Corky is a ex-con by choice and Violet is just a mafia guy's girl that is just unsatisfied. She wasn't abused or anything like that and claims she just couldn't stand being with a man that breaks the law and stuff and yet goes along with a ex-con instead. But that just seemed like a excuse because she is a lesbian. Sure Corky is less malicious compared to Caesar but just couldn't sympathize with any of the character. And sure Caesar is the bad guy of this story but he just didn't seem all that sadistic or evil and seemed to actually love Violet. Anyways when it comes down to it I didn't find any of the character likable. Sure you don't need likable characters in a movie for it to be a good or even great. But there just wasn't any characteristics or traits that made any of the characters stand out. It's just has bad people stealing from even badder people. Which can also work but not in this case. It's a alright directorial debut from the Wachowski's but nothing all that special. At least the Wachowski's directed a revolutionary film right after this one. And personally I think Gina Gershon would have been a better Trinity. 6.6/10

    Gina Gershon, Jennifer Tilly, Joe Pantoliano, John P. Ryan, and a very young Christopher Meloni star in "Bound," a 1996 film written and directed by the Wachowskis. Violet (Tilly) is the girlfriend of mobster Caesar (Pantoliano) meets a woman, Corky (Gershon) working as a plumber in their building. The two become lovers, and Violet talks Corky into helping her steal 2 million dollars from Caesar, who is holding the money and will turn it over to the big boss, Gino. The women set Caesar up to take the fall for the loss of the money. It doesn't go quite as planned. Violent, suspenseful, and tense, Bound is a real nail-biter. And I swear I've never heard such dramatic music in a film. It all goes toward setting up a nerve-wracking atmosphere. Violet is very sexy and does a great job as a mob girlfriend who knows her way around. Gershon is smart and tough as Corky. Someone made the comment that the two women didn't seem as in love as they should have been. I think there was a strong sexual attraction, and Violet saw a way out, and Corky, who has been in prison, was attracted to the money. The two have a passion for one another, but it's possible that neither one of them is capable of a deep, true love. Violet has been living with a man she doesn't care about -- she cares about Corky as much as she can, but I think she's a cool customer. Highly recommended if your nerves can stand it and if you don't mind all the violence. This is a very stylish film in the noir tradition.

    The Wachowskis are best known as the directors of The Matrix Trilogy. But before they were allowed to direct the first great movie and the so-so sequels they had to prove they were capable as directors. To do this they made a neo-noir small thriller, Bound: which resulted with us getting a very entertaining film. Corky (Gina Gershon) is an ex-convict who is hired to refurbish an apartment. Next door is a Mafia money launder, Caesar (Joe Pantoliano) and his girlfriend Violet (Jennifer Tilly). But Corky quickly finds out that Violet is really a lesbian and two have an affair. They see a opportunity to steal $2 Million from the Mafia and make Caesar the fall guy. But as the plan to put into action it starts to unravel and people start to die. Bound was a low budget film with a small cast and of a minimum of locations. It was a film that had to be driven by the characters and the plot and Wachowskis gave us taut and stylist experience. Bound has a neo-noir, postmodern style throughout as the plot twists and turns as the women's have to react to the changing situation. The Wachowskis were able to make the film ooze out tension and sexual energy throughout as they make get use of the limited sets as the characters can hear what is going on in the other apartment. Bound has all the visual flair you would expect from the directors of The Matrix and it was filled with flashy tricks: highlighted by fluid camera moves, fantastic editing and perfectly placed camera positions.

This movie is definitely a nail-biter that will keep you wondering what's next. It is remarkable that it shows women in a powerful position especially in contrast to the Mafia. This one will definitely keep you bound to the screen.

    Nice movie, stylish, atmospheric. The movie is about love, friendship, and it is believable. It's a rather typical crime story, the usual "italiano-money-mafia"-trash. Pathetic at that - most movies are about crime, pistols and violence. So it is hard to find a good one, 98% of these movies are just trash. But I really would like to give this one up to 10 points! Alas! There are more than three points of mistakes (I am aware of (and not really sober at that)) or obviously constructed and stupid twists. It is such a pity. I think someone in the future, let's say in the next 30 years, will cut this film anew, and we will have real fun. This film could be a classical movie, and I hope will be made into, but this version lacks of faith into the consumers. Why do every smart people in the business thinking all watchers are dumb?

    Those who seek out this film simply to see Gina Gershon and Jennifer Tilly entwined in sapphic bliss might be pleasantly surprised to discover that Bound is not just a good opportunity for an ogle but that it is actually a really good noir/pulp thrillerwell written, wonderfully directed, and brilliantly acted. The fact that the two female stars roll around together in the buff is just an added bonus. One of the most confident directorial debuts I have ever seen, Bound's writers/directors The Wachowski's employ all manner of subtle, stylish touches to tell their tale of two lesbians who decide to relieve the mafia of $2million dollars with shocking consequences. The result is not just tense, atmospheric and unpredictable, but visually arresting throughout as wellan accomplished work that deserves to be known for more than just its sexy bits. 8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.

    The best way to watch this picture is with the sound OFF. And no subtitles, either. The "steamy" lesbian sex scene (with body doubles for the closeups) is topped by hundreds of offerings available every day on the today's internet. The script is **dumb**, clich&eacute;-ridden with not one memorable line in the whole film, and more four-letter profanity than "The Sopranos". It was clearly written not just in a rush but by Hollywood types who have little idea of what Mafia guys really are like or how they operate. The portrayals of Caesar and the rest are grotesquely unconvincing. Nor does it stop there. The butch ex-con Corky also is more caricature than character--just a collection of tattoos and piercings in men's underwear that never adds up to a believable person. OK, the cinematography and sets are stylish. The producers got the most from a low budget with no money for outdoor scenes so it's **film noir** in color. So what? Gina Gershon never got a part again in a major movie after appearing in this **dreck**. Even if every queer in the western world gave this picture ten stars on here, Hollywood, like the viewing public, made its own decision and this picture was gone from theaters--those few it ran in--faster than a late night movie crowd.

    This one starts out fairly amusing and cool because of the stylish elements. And since it has Gina Gershon in her prime as this tough and yet hot lesbian with a nude scene. But despite that as this movie progressed I just quickly started to lose interest, maybe about 40 minutes in. The plot is about these two lesbians trying to steal from the mafia and one of the two lesbian is one of the mafia members girl named Violet(Jennifer Tilly). Who I just couldn't stand, Jennifer Tilly is good at playing these slightly ditsy character but I just could never get used to her voice. And the other a tough and yet hot ex-con who works as a painter and a plumber named Corky. And the mafia guy who they are trying to steal from is a guy named Caesar(Joe Pantoliano). Joe Pantoliano will also star in another role as Cypher which is a role that he will most likely be known for throughout his career. This is one of those movies about the girls overcoming the guys and staying stronger, which is fine. But it's done is a predictable and dull manner. I was expecting few curve balls but it just goes in a very predictable direction. During some scenes it just has way too much of a perfect timing to the point it becomes just plain out silly and ridiculous and this happens multiple times throughout this movie. Also none of the characters are likable in this movie. Corky is a ex-con by choice and Violet is just a mafia guy's girl that is just unsatisfied. She wasn't abused or anything like that and claims she just couldn't stand being with a man that breaks the law and stuff and yet goes along with a ex-con instead. But that just seemed like a excuse because she is a lesbian. Sure Corky is less malicious compared to Caesar but just couldn't sympathize with any of the character. And sure Caesar is the bad guy of this story but he just didn't seem all that sadistic or evil and seemed to actually love Violet. Anyways when it comes down to it I didn't find any of the character likable. Sure you don't need likable characters in a movie for it to be a good or even great. But there just wasn't any characteristics or traits that made any of the characters stand out. It's just has bad people stealing from even badder people. Which can also work but not in this case. It's a alright directorial debut from the Wachowski's but nothing all that special. At least the Wachowski's directed a revolutionary film right after this one. And personally I think Gina Gershon would have been a better Trinity. 6.6/10

    Gina Gershon, Jennifer Tilly, Joe Pantoliano, John P. Ryan, and a very young Christopher Meloni star in "Bound," a 1996 film written and directed by the Wachowskis. Violet (Tilly) is the girlfriend of mobster Caesar (Pantoliano) meets a woman, Corky (Gershon) working as a plumber in their building. The two become lovers, and Violet talks Corky into helping her steal 2 million dollars from Caesar, who is holding the money and will turn it over to the big boss, Gino. The women set Caesar up to take the fall for the loss of the money. It doesn't go quite as planned. Violent, suspenseful, and tense, Bound is a real nail-biter. And I swear I've never heard such dramatic music in a film. It all goes toward setting up a nerve-wracking atmosphere. Violet is very sexy and does a great job as a mob girlfriend who knows her way around. Gershon is smart and tough as Corky. Someone made the comment that the two women didn't seem as in love as they should have been. I think there was a strong sexual attraction, and Violet saw a way out, and Corky, who has been in prison, was attracted to the money. The two have a passion for one another, but it's possible that neither one of them is capable of a deep, true love. Violet has been living with a man she doesn't care about -- she cares about Corky as much as she can, but I think she's a cool customer. Highly recommended if your nerves can stand it and if you don't mind all the violence. This is a very stylish film in the noir tradition.

    The Wachowskis are best known as the directors of The Matrix Trilogy. But before they were allowed to direct the first great movie and the so-so sequels they had to prove they were capable as directors. To do this they made a neo-noir small thriller, Bound: which resulted with us getting a very entertaining film. Corky (Gina Gershon) is an ex-convict who is hired to refurbish an apartment. Next door is a Mafia money launder, Caesar (Joe Pantoliano) and his girlfriend Violet (Jennifer Tilly). But Corky quickly finds out that Violet is really a lesbian and two have an affair. They see a opportunity to steal $2 Million from the Mafia and make Caesar the fall guy. But as the plan to put into action it starts to unravel and people start to die. Bound was a low budget film with a small cast and of a minimum of locations. It was a film that had to be driven by the characters and the plot and Wachowskis gave us taut and stylist experience. Bound has a neo-noir, postmodern style throughout as the plot twists and turns as the women's have to react to the changing situation. The Wachowskis were able to make the film ooze out tension and sexual energy throughout as they make get use of the limited sets as the characters can hear what is going on in the other apartment. Bound has all the visual flair you would expect from the directors of The Matrix and it was filled with flashy tricks: highlighted by fluid camera moves, fantastic editing and perfectly placed camera positions. It was perfectly paced film and the editing make scenes follow together seamlessly. There are many moments and shots that's has striking similarities to The Matrix. Because of the crime story and much of the character moments and dialogue Bound felt very much like an early Quentin Tarantino film, particular Reservoir Dogs and Jackie Brown. They share similar styles and both Jackie Brown and Bound focusing on minor criminals and outsiders who plan to screw over a major criminal figure. Those films focus on a simple crime stories but are focused on the characters have a noir feel to them. Bound is an excellent film, a tight thriller that uses every moment of screenplay to great effect. The Wachowskis showed what they are capable of and ended up making an even better film.

    Bound is written and directed by Andrew and Larry Wachowski. It stars Jennifer Tilly, Gina Gershon, Joe Pantoliano, John P. Ryan and Christopher Meloni. Music is scored by Don Davis and cinematography by Bill Pope. Plot finds Violet (Tilly) and Corky (Gershon) as two newly acquainted lovers who plot to steal $2 million of mob money from Violet's boyfriend, Caesar (Pantoliano). Quite a directorial debut from The Wachowski Brothers, a stylised neo-noir of considerable substance. Where once was man and woman treading the dark paths in film noir's halcyon days, now glides two women, lovers in cahoots, deadly femmes. The beauty of it all is that the lesbian lovers twist is no gimmick, it adds a dangerous quality to the narrative, the coupling is sexy but tender, a pair of gals who are very easy to root for, with extra tension wrung out by the slick characterisations. Both gals have been "bound" by ties in the preceding five years, Corky by way of doing a stretch in prison, let down by a former lover, and Violet in a restrictive relationship with Caesar. As the two come together, trust and betrayal are delicately perched on the see-saw, which way will it tilt? Much has been made of the sex scene between Corky and Violet that drives the plotting forward, but it would be a shame if Bound is only remembered for this scene. There is no titillation here, no grubby top shelf leanings, it's wonderfully sexy for sure, but natural passion rules the day, a believable union that underpins the drama. How nice, too, to find that in amongst the smouldering story the Wachowski's don't take a lazy option with the character of Caesar. It would have been so easy to just write him as a hapless dupe being spun to his doom by the femmes, but he no idiot, he's brainy and brawny, if the gals are to get away with their plan then they will have to work real hard to succeed. This keeps the narrative true, a rare treat since many other 90s thrillers fail to do so. With the dialogue pinging and Pope's cinematography sharp, tech aspects score high, with the brothers showing some deft visual touches along the way (the blood and paint finale especially is a real cracker). But none of it would impact the way it does without the trio of great performances from the leads. Tilly is slinky and kinky, a Monroesque creation, Gershon goes method, all brooding with intensity, and Pantoliano handles superbly the shift from calm mob launderer to frantic stooge. Great performances doing justice to the rich characterisations on the page. There's a slight irritant that we could have gone a touch deeper with Corky's past, while Meloni's loose cannon is too by the numbers, but they are minor blots on an otherwise terrific neo-noir landscape. 9/10

    Notorious for its lesbian scenes and the sexy female leads, this debut for the Matrix Directors is a naughty little neonoir that comes close, but does not attain minor classic status. A good looking film that showcases some visual flair but, the claustrophobic low budget is somehow not utilized for ultimate effect and the male characters are not edgy enough to penetrate these strong, luscious women. Joey Pants is great but just can't satisfy against such demanding, delicious dykes. A very good thriller that could be a bit more imaginative and little less lazy.

    Whichever critical or analytical angle you look at Bound by the Wachowski brothers, it is a film that is quite successful in each realm it chooses to represent. The film spans across the lesbian and thriller genre, which in part may have contributed to the film's widely acclaimed success upon release in the late nineties. Bound's ability to fluctuate beautifully between genres enhances the film's appeal, but perhaps the more critical film viewer felt as if Bound was less of a thriller, and more of a tale of prohibited romance between Corky (Gina Gershon) and Violet (Jennifer Tilly). It is in this way, as a lesbian film, that I wish to discuss elements of the film. The film's title itself represents a double meaning. To be bound to something, unable to be free or obtain a more personal self-freedom, is a defining factor in the film. In a heteronormative society that functions on social stereotypes and condemnable taboos, lesbian romance is literally bound to social constructionism. This is a pessimistic view of the film, but still remains to be a defining element in any "controversial" film to be considered and evaluated. Other than social normativity as a restriction for Corky and Violet's relationship, Violet's mobster boyfriend Caesar acts as a physical and mental barrier for Violet. Violet is bound to Caesar and the "business" in which he deals. She struggles to escape from his grip. In the first half of the film where Caesar's character is not present, Corky and Violet are able to flourish together in his absence. Yet, his presence becomes inherently violent and threatening whenever Violet stresses that she will leave him. Violet is unable to fulfill this promise without Corky. The more positive aspect to the film's title is that the Wachowski brothers reinforce a positive future for Corky and Violet. They are bound to one another, and are bound to escape (together) a dark, violent, and restrictive world forced upon them by Caesar and his mobster affiliates. While previously restrictive elements jeopardized their romantic relationship (not to mention getting away with the $2 million), Corky and Violet were predestined or bound to have a life together. Caesar, the mobsters, or the two lone, prison-like apartments in the film are unable to break this bond between Corky and Violet that can be seen in the very beginning of their journey. Gershon and Tilly function together brilliantly on screen, channeling just the right amount of sexual tension in a precisely calculated situation requiring trust, a vital element to any relationship. Gershon first appears to be rather fluid in her sexuality, at certain points the filmmakers seem to imply this ambiguous sexuality in her character. As viewers, we assume she is attracted to both men and women, even though we never see her interact sexually or flirtatiously with a man. Even in the bar scene, Gershon seeks out a female companion for the night but is denied by outside influences (the cop). Gershon's physically referred to as a "dike" or the embodiment of the masculine female. On the other hand, Tilly is quite the opposite, but finds Gershon's character to be enticingly attractive. Perhaps the seemingly heterosexual Violet seeks the thrill of being with Corky because it is "forbidden" in her reality to venture outside Caesar's apartment and out of his bed. Despite how initial attraction was conceived, Corky and Violet's romance is evidence of a heroic effort to overcome external forces that would otherwise criticize and scrutinize a romance such as theirs, which is ultimately more successful than any heterosexual relationship seen in the film.

    Wow. This one definitely caught me off-guard. Written and directed by the more than talented Wachowski brothers (creators of 'The Matrix') who were nothing but creative-minded college dropouts in their 20s in 1997, 'Bound' is a brilliant example of how they could convince the world of their unique ability to create unusual scenes. Take the story for example: A lesbian ex con, Corky (Gina Gershon) is hired to work as a plumber in an apartment, right next door to Violet (Jennifer Tilly) and her mobster boyfriend, Caesar (Joe Pantoliano). The initial attraction between the two women soon turns into a passionate affair, and the two decide to set Caesar up by stealing $2 million from the Mafia. The plan works smoothly up until Caesar reacts in an unexpected manner. I must admit that at first I was a little disappointed to see Corky and Violent embark in an affair so early into the movie, because I was afraid this piece would be yet another example portraying lesbian relationships solely consisting of near-pornographic encounters between strangers. However, later on it becomes evident that the two women are not only drawn to each other due to sexual attraction, they are bound by something beyond that. Perhaps it is the recognition that they are not as different as they appear to be; Corky being the sexy slim tomboy type, while Violent representing the epitome of curvaceous femininity a'la Betty Boop. Though it is set somewhere in the 90s, it displays characteristic film noir traits, which also gives a great opportunity for unique directions. I loved the way the Wachowski brothers managed to jump from one scene and time to the other without much problem, or show what the characters were thinking without using words, or focus on an object (such as a pistol) before zooming out onto the bigger scene. They also managed to make the sex scenes very intense without being overly pornographic. That is the kind of directing I treasure, as it does not allow the viewer to divert their attention. The acting was impeccable. Both Gershon and Tilly did a wonderful job, every little detail of their characters seemed to make sense in the greater picture. Pantoliano was seemingly born to do the role of Caesar, and he aptly displayed the mobster's paranoia and moments of weakness, along with the cruelty that goes with the job. This movie is definitely a nail-biter that will keep you wondering what's next. It is remarkable that it shows women in a powerful position especially in contrast to the Mafia. This one will definitely keep you bound to the screen.
