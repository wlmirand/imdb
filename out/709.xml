 <sinopse>
  A maverick dancer risks his career by performing an unusual routine and sets out to succeed with a new partner.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Scott Hastings is a champion caliber ballroom dancer, but much to the chagrin of the Australian ballroom dance community, Scott believes in dancing "his own steps". Fran is a beginning dancer and a bit of an ugly duckly who has the audacity to ask to be Scott's partner after his unorthodox style causes his regular partner to dance out of his life. Together, these two misfits try to win the Australian Pan Pacific Championships and show the Ballroom Confederation that they are wrong when they say, "there are no new steps!"

    The plot follows a predictable line and some characters are stereotyped to the verge of spoof - a notion not half helped by the hilarious Ausssie accents. However the acting, editing and humor overcome this and turn it into a really great-fun-to-watch movie - and not just for dance lovers. This is an underrated movie with great romantic scenes alternating with tense moments and topped with a good climax. A better, non-repetitive and more imaginative soundtrack would have made it into a classic. Paul Mercurio's acting and dancing glue the movie together. Antonio Vargas adds weight to the cast and shows everyone what real dance is. Armonia Benedito as Fran's grandma is a real gem. Recommended.

    Here, the movie starts in the Waratah Championships, a setup for the big Pan-Pacific Ballroom Championships later on. Scott Hastings had already danced a great Viennese waltz with former partner Liz Holt, and then, as the scene shifts to samba, Scott Hastings starts out great with Liz, and then, in the middle of the samba version of "Tequila" in the background, Scott explodes and does his overkill-laden solo trick steps way beyond what Liz could follow. Les Kendall, Scott's dance coach, explains the reason why Scott wanted to free himself--in the start of the samba, Les said that he was "boxed-in" by Ken Rallings and Tina Sparkles, which caused Scott to release a freedom type of dancing anger. Liz tries to keep up with Scott's unacceptable solo dance showmanship but then, Australian Dance Council chairman, Barry Fife, penalizes that couple major points causing Ken and Tina to win the Waratah title. Liz then finally cuts off her dance partnership with Scott after the competition at the next scene in the Kendall Dance Studio. Then, a new beginning dance partner, Fran, accosts Scott at the studio and make a ruse to be new partners and practice their routine in light of the upcoming Pan-Pacific Dance Championships. Fran's flamenco dance ability is given away a bit when she demonstrates a short tap sequence. Learning from the dancesport debacle in Waratah, Scott is still stubborn and decides to strongly bend the dancesport rules with "new steps" for the Pan-Pacific championships to try to impress Barry Fife. Barry is not happy about it and decides that Scott's "new steps" will never, ever be in the books in competition as long as Fife remains in power in Australian dancesport. In the middle of the movie, Tina Sparkle decides to retire from her partnership from Ken Railings, doing their final honor dance at a pre- competition social ballroom dance party, while at the same time, Scott and Fran, do a theatrical dance in quasi-silhouette to "Perhaps Perhaps Perhaps." This is where the disapproval of their partnership increases. Les Kendall now warns Scott that if you dance with Fran, you will never win the Pan-Pacific competition, but then suggests to Scott that if you partner up with Tina, you will have a 100 percent shot of winning the Pan-Pacific title. But then, Fran and Scott are caught by Fran's flamenco music family, forcing them to dance a paso doble, and then, eventually, Fran's father then teaches him the authentic Spanish paso doble. The solo focusing of the paso is the beginning of the recipe for almost total disaster on the start of the Pan-Pacific championships. In the appetizer paso doble heat in the competition floor, Fran does dance with an unknown lady, and then, as Scott arrives to face the forced partnering of Tina Sparkles with him for the Latin championship round, Scott decides at the last minute to dance with Fran in the second paso doble around with several professional Latin dance couples dancing. Barry Fife, already there, catches Fran and Scott in the action and orders the music powered down, and disqualifies both dancers for good. Fran and Scott, however, refuses to leave the floor and instead, with the help of Fran's family, dance a spectacular Spanish flamenco dance with strong paso feel, shocking the audience, and even Barry Fife himself. In the end, the audience comes out to the dance floor to get their chance to dance, and the guess is that even if disqualified--you can shock a crowd if you do a great unique dance, and that's what Fran and Scott did. They won their hearts, even if it is not a championship trophy!

    I had never heard of this film and started watching it just after the intro credits ran by. I immediately thought this was a John Waters film. I thought this until a commercial came on and they mentioned the name of the director. I was surprised. The female lead character in this film is introduced. She has stained, crooked teeth. Her hair looks like the Bride of Frankenstein's... only worn in a ponytail. And on her face she's got the worst case of pimples I've ever seen in my life. She is clumsy too and is dressed essentially in one of Andre the Giant's old dirty T shirts. As the movie progresses she gradually becomes quite attractive and nimble on her feet. I don't understand that. Is she still ugly, but we are seeing her looks improve by viewing her through the eyes of her dance partner, who is falling in love with her? A love is blind sort of thing? Or does her growing self confidence miraculously transform her teeth, hair, complexion and wardrobe? Discounting those questions that I kept asking myself, I though this was a pleasant film. No violence to speak of. No foul language. No sex. Just a nice little film where dancers with lots of talent have the opportunity to showcase their craft. There's no heavy plot to follow and get you thinking. Purely for the entertainment value of the dancers. I certainly DO NOT think this was an amazingly wonderful, great, 10 star movie. I wonder if everybody else saw the same film as me. Honestly it was better than average, but not by a whole lot.

    With the recent upsurge in popularity in and broadcasting of all things Ballroom and dancing and stuff, it seems I'm the only one I know that can resist it - and quite easily, at that. All that forced preening, pirouetting and showing off leaves me cold. Baz Lurhmann's debut film, Strictly Ballroom, however, at least actually gets me looking at the screen and not my toes. Whilst not getting quite as enraptured by its sparkly magic as much as some folk - and many critics, it is the story and the very human one at that shines through. Everyone who has a single DNA in their bodies that gives them an ounce of heart and compassion will soon appreciate this modern fairytale. Some of the styles are rather alarming, both in hair and fashion but that now adds to the film's charm and keeps the metabolism slightly uneven. Strangely, to me, it looks a little older than the 20 years that it is. For the rest of the population who do enjoy "Strictly" and those other shows will undoubtedly lap this one up. Not only do you get the swirly moves but a beautiful story, too.

    Absolutely brilliant; by the writer and the director and the actors. Shirley Hastings is one of the most important and true characters in any Art form. She is to be studied by students in psychology, psychiatry, and social work. As is her husband. Unfortunately the theme is all too common. The future is the youth. To stifle them is so wrong on so many levels. Narcissism abounds. It is epidemic and crippling to happiness and creativity. The hen-pecked husband is all too common in marriages. His realization of this is awaited by the audience throughout the movie...Does he ever break-away from the narcissistic dominating wife? How does one do this and keep a marriage together? How does a son break away from a mother? From a father? From both?

    An entertaining low-budget Australian dancing and romance movie by Baz Luhrman. It is the first movie of his trilogy The Red Curtain. Strictly Ballroom is, in few words, the story of a ugly dancing duckling who finds her break-the-rules swan dancer. It is the story of Scott, a brilliant ballroom dancer trained in a prestigious dancing school since his childhood, who is to become the next Pan-Pacific champion if he follows traditional ballroom style and moves. However, he has a spirit of his own, a dancing creativity that he's trying to channel and express in front of the public. In his way to become himself as a dancer, he pairs -not previous begging and hard work- with beginner dancer Fran, a shy Spanish girl from a family of flamenco dancers. The movie has a predictable unoriginal story and stereotypical characters, but the script is light and funny, engaging and fresh, and a little bit Kitch but in a charming way. The musical numbers are danced with talent and great heart, and they are very enjoyable. I especially liked the funny retro images telling the story of Scott's dancing parents through dance, which are truly creative, theatrical, and delightful. To me, this is Baz Luhrman's most Australian movie, despite not pretending to be so. Definitely more Australian than his movie Australia, but much less pretentious and with much more heart. The movie presents a mix of true Australian characters, Anglosaxons and immigrants (in this case Spaniards), passionate people about competition and sports, always giving their best to win anything - hard working dreamers. Moreover, the characters and the story have a very Australian sense of humor, and the characters speak with a marked Australian strong accent, especially clear in Cariades' character. In fact, the characters and atmosphere somewhat reminded me of those unforgettable ones in the Australian film The Castle. Overall, the performances are very good. Paul Mercurio and Tana Merice are convincing and good in their acting and dancing. Paul Mercurio is really great in his dancing. All the supporting actors are terrific and nail their characters: Pat Thomson (who died before the movie was premiered) as Scott's mother Shirley, Barry Otto as Scott's father Doug, Gia Carides as Scott's first dancing partner Liz, Bill Hunter as the President of the Ballroom Australian Federation, and Peter Whitford as the owner and director of Les Kendall's Dance Academy. Antonio Vargas and Armonia Benedito are also very charming as Fran's father and grandma. An unpretentious light heart-warming entertaining movie, with lots of Spanish moments!

    Strictly Ballroom (1992) A campy, glossy, colorful, surprising fairy tale, total romance, lots of dancing, and inventive through and through. No, director Baz Luhmann has not pulled off another Moulin Rouge, which is a whole other order of invention and beauty, but this is his first movie, and it's filled with idealism. And some people to root for and to hiss against--you know, heroes and villains. It could have been tightened up, no doubt--there are times when I was a little impatient even though they were dancing away. But mostly I was happy to watch and wait for the next step toward the big climax. The two young leads, interestingly, came from nowhere (the perfectly named Paul Mercurio and the understated Tara Morice both in their first films). They've gone on to largely television careers, and in part you appreciate how much Luhmann gets from them. The highly stylized approach helps avoid a need for real acting, per se, but Mercurio in particular really rises to the occasion. The whole affair is Australian, and it feels bright and original the way some of fellow Aussie Peter Weir's films do, or in another sense, Peter Jackson. If you can summon up any innocence and romance and go for what really clicks here, be swept up and love it.

    So Strictly Ballroom. I don't know exactly what I was expecting of this movie, but it was definitely different from what I expected. But that is not to say that I did not enjoy it a ton. I thought it was overall a good and really fun movie. The music and dance throughout the movie, as pretty much a method of story telling, worked very well for the movie and keep the story meaningful and engaging. Some of the characters and lines were a bit outlandish, but all in all, it fit together remarkable well, and created an enjoyable experience. Even thought there was nothing overly remarkable about the story's main love interest plot between Fran and Scott, I felt that it still worked out well. The discussion of dance as a act of creating a perceived love as part of the act was interesting and something I have thought about before so I found it nice to be brought up in the movie (even if only for a few lines). I thought that most of then characters, though maybe a bit simple, really came together to create a pretty good story. My personal favorite character was Doug though (even before finding out about his secret). I thought his overall fairly eccentric character was a lot of fun and in ways very relatable. All in all, this was a fun movie. For anyone that is willing to give a bit of a different way to tell a story a chance I would recommend giving it a shot.

    I sure enjoyed it despite the complete lack of explosions or car chases. Where I'm coming from: I'm a 54 year old male who has danced for 15 years. My girlfriend has danced since she was 3. We don't compete because it would make our relaxing hobby a pressured nightmare (and, frankly, because I'm not very good). My daughter competed and did very well. Some reviewers apparently missed that this movie is a satire and it's supposed to be dumb and funny. Having sat through more competitions than I can count, I can state this movie hits the nail on the head. The parents, the kids, the beginners, the prima donnas...it's all true. Yes, it's really campy and schmaltzy, the plot has holes you could drive a truck through, the acting is sometimes marginal, but we both enjoyed it and laughed out loud. And what's the best part of this movie? The dancing. It is photographed and edited such that you can really see and enjoy the dancing without having constant cutaways to the judges or the audience (as in current American TV dance competitions. I don't know about you, but I watch dance shows for the dancing). There are no deep plot twists to be analyzed, no characters I need to understand better...but we definitely plan to watch this again because the dancing is really good. If you liked this, you will enjoy Best in Show.

    I thought this movie was great. I watched it in my freshman Spanish class and I just can't get enough! It's just SO FUNNY! I love the dancing scenes in this movie, especially the dad! He is hilarious. I hope to watch this with my family sometime in the near future, they love stuff like this just as much as me. I give this movie ten stars, multiplied by 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000! I watched it, always wanting more time to watch, because we only have 45 minute Spanish classes. This movie is a never ending laugh-fest, except for a few rather tense scenes, but even those are a little funny. I was reminded of Dirty Dancing, what with the whole "jerk dancer means prospective rookie" plot line.

It could have been tightened up, no doubt--there are times when I was a little impatient even though they were dancing away. But mostly I was happy to watch and wait for the next step toward the big climax. The two young leads, interestingly, came from nowhere (the perfectly named Paul Mercurio and the understated Tara Morice both in their first films). They've gone on to largely television careers, and in part you appreciate how much Luhmann gets from them. The highly stylized approach helps avoid a need for real acting, per se, but Mercurio in particular really rises to the occasion. The whole affair is Australian, and it feels bright and original the way some of fellow Aussie Peter Weir's films do, or in another sense, Peter Jackson. If you can summon up any innocence and romance and go for what really clicks here, be swept up and love it.

    So Strictly Ballroom. I don't know exactly what I was expecting of this movie, but it was definitely different from what I expected. But that is not to say that I did not enjoy it a ton. I thought it was overall a good and really fun movie. The music and dance throughout the movie, as pretty much a method of story telling, worked very well for the movie and keep the story meaningful and engaging. Some of the characters and lines were a bit outlandish, but all in all, it fit together remarkable well, and created an enjoyable experience. Even thought there was nothing overly remarkable about the story's main love interest plot between Fran and Scott, I felt that it still worked out well. The discussion of dance as a act of creating a perceived love as part of the act was interesting and something I have thought about before so I found it nice to be brought up in the movie (even if only for a few lines). I thought that most of then characters, though maybe a bit simple, really came together to create a pretty good story. My personal favorite character was Doug though (even before finding out about his secret). I thought his overall fairly eccentric character was a lot of fun and in ways very relatable. All in all, this was a fun movie. For anyone that is willing to give a bit of a different way to tell a story a chance I would recommend giving it a shot.

    I sure enjoyed it despite the complete lack of explosions or car chases. Where I'm coming from: I'm a 54 year old male who has danced for 15 years. My girlfriend has danced since she was 3. We don't compete because it would make our relaxing hobby a pressured nightmare (and, frankly, because I'm not very good). My daughter competed and did very well. Some reviewers apparently missed that this movie is a satire and it's supposed to be dumb and funny. Having sat through more competitions than I can count, I can state this movie hits the nail on the head. The parents, the kids, the beginners, the prima donnas...it's all true. Yes, it's really campy and schmaltzy, the plot has holes you could drive a truck through, the acting is sometimes marginal, but we both enjoyed it and laughed out loud. And what's the best part of this movie? The dancing. It is photographed and edited such that you can really see and enjoy the dancing without having constant cutaways to the judges or the audience (as in current American TV dance competitions. I don't know about you, but I watch dance shows for the dancing). There are no deep plot twists to be analyzed, no characters I need to understand better...but we definitely plan to watch this again because the dancing is really good. If you liked this, you will enjoy Best in Show.

    I thought this movie was great. I watched it in my freshman Spanish class and I just can't get enough! It's just SO FUNNY! I love the dancing scenes in this movie, especially the dad! He is hilarious. I hope to watch this with my family sometime in the near future, they love stuff like this just as much as me. I give this movie ten stars, multiplied by 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000! I watched it, always wanting more time to watch, because we only have 45 minute Spanish classes. This movie is a never ending laugh-fest, except for a few rather tense scenes, but even those are a little funny. I was reminded of Dirty Dancing, what with the whole "jerk dancer means prospective rookie" plot line.

    The plot follows a predictable line and some characters are stereotyped to the verge of spoof - a notion not half helped by the hilarious Ausssie accents. However the acting, editing and humor overcome this and turn it into a really great-fun-to-watch movie - and not just for dance lovers. This is an underrated movie with great romantic scenes alternating with tense moments and topped with a good climax. A better, non-repetitive and more imaginative soundtrack would have made it into a classic. Paul Mercurio's acting and dancing glue the movie together. Antonio Vargas adds weight to the cast and shows everyone what real dance is. Armonia Benedito as Fran's grandma is a real gem. Recommended.

    Here, the movie starts in the Waratah Championships, a setup for the big Pan-Pacific Ballroom Championships later on. Scott Hastings had already danced a great Viennese waltz with former partner Liz Holt, and then, as the scene shifts to samba, Scott Hastings starts out great with Liz, and then, in the middle of the samba version of "Tequila" in the background, Scott explodes and does his overkill-laden solo trick steps way beyond what Liz could follow. Les Kendall, Scott's dance coach, explains the reason why Scott wanted to free himself--in the start of the samba, Les said that he was "boxed-in" by Ken Rallings and Tina Sparkles, which caused Scott to release a freedom type of dancing anger. Liz tries to keep up with Scott's unacceptable solo dance showmanship but then, Australian Dance Council chairman, Barry Fife, penalizes that couple major points causing Ken and Tina to win the Waratah title. Liz then finally cuts off her dance partnership with Scott after the competition at the next scene in the Kendall Dance Studio. Then, a new beginning dance partner, Fran, accosts Scott at the studio and make a ruse to be new partners and practice their routine in light of the upcoming Pan-Pacific Dance Championships. Fran's flamenco dance ability is given away a bit when she demonstrates a short tap sequence. Learning from the dancesport debacle in Waratah, Scott is still stubborn and decides to strongly bend the dancesport rules with "new steps" for the Pan-Pacific championships to try to impress Barry Fife. Barry is not happy about it and decides that Scott's "new steps" will never, ever be in the books in competition as long as Fife remains in power in Australian dancesport. In the middle of the movie, Tina Sparkle decides to retire from her partnership from Ken Railings, doing their final honor dance at a pre- competition social ballroom dance party, while at the same time, Scott and Fran, do a theatrical dance in quasi-silhouette to "Perhaps Perhaps Perhaps." This is where the disapproval of their partnership increases. Les Kendall now warns Scott that if you dance with Fran, you will never win the Pan-Pacific competition, but then suggests to Scott that if you partner up with Tina, you will have a 100 percent shot of winning the Pan-Pacific title. But then, Fran and Scott are caught by Fran's flamenco music family, forcing them to dance a paso doble, and then, eventually, Fran's father then teaches him the authentic Spanish paso doble. The solo focusing of the paso is the beginning of the recipe for almost total disaster on the start of the Pan-Pacific championships. In the appetizer paso doble heat in the competition floor, Fran does dance with an unknown lady, and then, as Scott arrives to face the forced partnering of Tina Sparkles with him for the Latin championship round, Scott decides at the last minute to dance with Fran in the second paso doble around with several professional Latin dance couples dancing. Barry Fife, already there, catches Fran and Scott in the action and orders the music powered down, and disqualifies both dancers for good. Fran and Scott, however, refuses to leave the floor and instead, with the help of Fran's family, dance a spectacular Spanish flamenco dance with strong paso feel, shocking the audience, and even Barry Fife himself. In the end, the audience comes out to the dance floor to get their chance to dance, and the guess is that even if disqualified--you can shock a crowd if you do a great unique dance, and that's what Fran and Scott did. They won their hearts, even if it is not a championship trophy!

    I had never heard of this film and started watching it just after the intro credits ran by. I immediately thought this was a John Waters film. I thought this until a commercial came on and they mentioned the name of the director. I was surprised. The female lead character in this film is introduced. She has stained, crooked teeth. Her hair looks like the Bride of Frankenstein's... only worn in a ponytail. And on her face she's got the worst case of pimples I've ever seen in my life. She is clumsy too and is dressed essentially in one of Andre the Giant's old dirty T shirts. As the movie progresses she gradually becomes quite attractive and nimble on her feet. I don't understand that. Is she still ugly, but we are seeing her looks improve by viewing her through the eyes of her dance partner, who is falling in love with her? A love is blind sort of thing? Or does her growing self confidence miraculously transform her teeth, hair, complexion and wardrobe? Discounting those questions that I kept asking myself, I though this was a pleasant film. No violence to speak of. No foul language. No sex. Just a nice little film where dancers with lots of talent have the opportunity to showcase their craft. There's no heavy plot to follow and get you thinking. Purely for the entertainment value of the dancers. I certainly DO NOT think this was an amazingly wonderful, great, 10 star movie. I wonder if everybody else saw the same film as me. Honestly it was better than average, but not by a whole lot.

    With the recent upsurge in popularity in and broadcasting of all things Ballroom and dancing and stuff, it seems I'm the only one I know that can resist it - and quite easily, at that. All that forced preening, pirouetting and showing off leaves me cold. Baz Lurhmann's debut film, Strictly Ballroom, however, at least actually gets me looking at the screen and not my toes. Whilst not getting quite as enraptured by its sparkly magic as much as some folk - and many critics, it is the story and the very human one at that shines through. Everyone who has a single DNA in their bodies that gives them an ounce of heart and compassion will soon appreciate this modern fairytale. Some of the styles are rather alarming, both in hair and fashion but that now adds to the film's charm and keeps the metabolism slightly uneven. Strangely, to me, it looks a little older than the 20 years that it is. For the rest of the population who do enjoy "Strictly" and those other shows will undoubtedly lap this one up. Not only do you get the swirly moves but a beautiful story, too.

    Absolutely brilliant; by the writer and the director and the actors. Shirley Hastings is one of the most important and true characters in any Art form. She is to be studied by students in psychology, psychiatry, and social work. As is her husband. Unfortunately the theme is all too common. The future is the youth. To stifle them is so wrong on so many levels. Narcissism abounds. It is epidemic and crippling to happiness and creativity. The hen-pecked husband is all too common in marriages. His realization of this is awaited by the audience throughout the movie...Does he ever break-away from the narcissistic dominating wife? How does one do this and keep a marriage together? How does a son break away from a mother? From a father? From both?

    An entertaining low-budget Australian dancing and romance movie by Baz Luhrman. It is the first movie of his trilogy The Red Curtain. Strictly Ballroom is, in few words, the story of a ugly dancing duckling who finds her break-the-rules swan dancer. It is the story of Scott, a brilliant ballroom dancer trained in a prestigious dancing school since his childhood, who is to become the next Pan-Pacific champion if he follows traditional ballroom style and moves. However, he has a spirit of his own, a dancing creativity that he's trying to channel and express in front of the public. In his way to become himself as a dancer, he pairs -not previous begging and hard work- with beginner dancer Fran, a shy Spanish girl from a family of flamenco dancers. The movie has a predictable unoriginal story and stereotypical characters, but the script is light and funny, engaging and fresh, and a little bit Kitch but in a charming way. The musical numbers are danced with talent and great heart, and they are very enjoyable. I especially liked the funny retro images telling the story of Scott's dancing parents through dance, which are truly creative, theatrical, and delightful. To me, this is Baz Luhrman's most Australian movie, despite not pretending to be so. Definitely more Australian than his movie Australia, but much less pretentious and with much more heart. The movie presents a mix of true Australian characters, Anglosaxons and immigrants (in this case Spaniards), passionate people about competition and sports, always giving their best to win anything - hard working dreamers. Moreover, the characters and the story have a very Australian sense of humor, and the characters speak with a marked Australian strong accent, especially clear in Cariades' character. In fact, the characters and atmosphere somewhat reminded me of those unforgettable ones in the Australian film The Castle. Overall, the performances are very good. Paul Mercurio and Tana Merice are convincing and good in their acting and dancing. Paul Mercurio is really great in his dancing. All the supporting actors are terrific and nail their characters: Pat Thomson (who died before the movie was premiered) as Scott's mother Shirley, Barry Otto as Scott's father Doug, Gia Carides as Scott's first dancing partner Liz, Bill Hunter as the President of the Ballroom Australian Federation, and Peter Whitford as the owner and director of Les Kendall's Dance Academy. Antonio Vargas and Armonia Benedito are also very charming as Fran's father and grandma. An unpretentious light heart-warming entertaining movie, with lots of Spanish moments!

    Strictly Ballroom (1992) A campy, glossy, colorful, surprising fairy tale, total romance, lots of dancing, and inventive through and through. No, director Baz Luhmann has not pulled off another Moulin Rouge, which is a whole other order of invention and beauty, but this is his first movie, and it's filled with idealism. And some people to root for and to hiss against--you know, heroes and villains. It could have been tightened up, no doubt--there are times when I was a little impatient even though they were dancing away. But mostly I was happy to watch and wait for the next step toward the big climax. The two young leads, interestingly, came from nowhere (the perfectly named Paul Mercurio and the understated Tara Morice both in their first films). They've gone on to largely television careers, and in part you appreciate how much Luhmann gets from them. The highly stylized approach helps avoid a need for real acting, per se, but Mercurio in particular really rises to the occasion. The whole affair is Australian, and it feels bright and original the way some of fellow Aussie Peter Weir's films do, or in another sense, Peter Jackson. If you can summon up any innocence and romance and go for what really clicks here, be swept up and love it.

    An entertaining low-budget Australian dancing and romance movie by Baz Luhrman. It is the first movie of his trilogy The Red Curtain. Strictly Ballroom is, in few words, the story of a ugly dancing duckling who finds her break-the-rules swan dancer. It is the story of Scott, a brilliant ballroom dancer trained in a prestigious dancing school since his childhood, who is to become the next Pan-Pacific champion if he follows traditional ballroom style and moves. However, he has a spirit of his own, a dancing creativity that he's trying to channel and express in front of the public. In his way to become himself as a dancer, he pairs -not previous begging and hard work- with beginner dancer Fran, a shy Spanish girl from a family of flamenco dancers. The movie has a predictable unoriginal story and stereotypical characters, but the script is light and funny, engaging and fresh, and a little bit Kitch but in a charming way. The musical numbers are danced with talent and great heart, and they are very enjoyable. I especially liked the funny retro images telling the story of Scott's dancing parents through dance, which are truly creative, theatrical, and delightful. To me, this is Baz Luhrman's most Australian movie, despite not pretending to be so. Definitely more Australian than his movie Australia, but much less pretentious and with much more heart. The movie presents a mix of true Australian characters, Anglosaxons and immigrants (in this case Spaniards), passionate people about competition and sports, always giving their best to win anything - hard working dreamers. Moreover, the characters and the story have a very Australian sense of humor, and the characters speak with a marked Australian strong accent, especially clear in Cariades' character. In fact, the characters and atmosphere somewhat reminded me of those unforgettable ones in the Australian film The Castle. Overall, the performances are very good. Paul Mercurio and Tana Merice are convincing and good in their acting and dancing. Paul Mercurio is really great in his dancing. All the supporting actors are terrific and nail their characters: Pat Thomson (who died before the movie was premiered) as Scott's mother Shirley, Barry Otto as Scott's father Doug, Gia Carides as Scott's first dancing partner Liz, Bill Hunter as the President of the Ballroom Australian Federation, and Peter Whitford as the owner and director of Les Kendall's Dance Academy. Antonio Vargas and Armonia Benedito are also very charming as Fran's father and grandma. An unpretentious light heart-warming entertaining movie, with lots of Spanish moments!

    Strictly Ballroom (1992) A campy, glossy, colorful, surprising fairy tale, total romance, lots of dancing, and inventive through and through. No, director Baz Luhmann has not pulled off another Moulin Rouge, which is a whole other order of invention and beauty, but this is his first movie, and it's filled with idealism. And some people to root for and to hiss against--you know, heroes and villains. It could have been tightened up, no doubt--there are times when I was a little impatient even though they were dancing away. But mostly I was happy to watch and wait for the next step toward the big climax. The two young leads, interestingly, came from nowhere (the perfectly named Paul Mercurio and the understated Tara Morice both in their first films). They've gone on to largely television careers, and in part you appreciate how much Luhmann gets from them. The highly stylized approach helps avoid a need for real acting, per se, but Mercurio in particular really rises to the occasion. The whole affair is Australian, and it feels bright and original the way some of fellow Aussie Peter Weir's films do, or in another sense, Peter Jackson. If you can summon up any innocence and romance and go for what really clicks here, be swept up and love it.

    So Strictly Ballroom. I don't know exactly what I was expecting of this movie, but it was definitely different from what I expected. But that is not to say that I did not enjoy it a ton. I thought it was overall a good and really fun movie. The music and dance throughout the movie, as pretty much a method of story telling, worked very well for the movie and keep the story meaningful and engaging. Some of the characters and lines were a bit outlandish, but all in all, it fit together remarkable well, and created an enjoyable experience. Even thought there was nothing overly remarkable about the story's main love interest plot between Fran and Scott, I felt that it still worked out well. The discussion of dance as a act of creating a perceived love as part of the act was interesting and something I have thought about before so I found it nice to be brought up in the movie (even if only for a few lines). I thought that most of then characters, though maybe a bit simple, really came together to create a pretty good story. My personal favorite character was Doug though (even before finding out about his secret). I thought his overall fairly eccentric character was a lot of fun and in ways very relatable. All in all, this was a fun movie. For anyone that is willing to give a bit of a different way to tell a story a chance I would recommend giving it a shot.

    I sure enjoyed it despite the complete lack of explosions or car chases. Where I'm coming from: I'm a 54 year old male who has danced for 15 years. My girlfriend has danced since she was 3. We don't compete because it would make our relaxing hobby a pressured nightmare (and, frankly, because I'm not very good). My daughter competed and did very well. Some reviewers apparently missed that this movie is a satire and it's supposed to be dumb and funny. Having sat through more competitions than I can count, I can state this movie hits the nail on the head. The parents, the kids, the beginners, the prima donnas...it's all true. Yes, it's really campy and schmaltzy, the plot has holes you could drive a truck through, the acting is sometimes marginal, but we both enjoyed it and laughed out loud. And what's the best part of this movie? The dancing. It is photographed and edited such that you can really see and enjoy the dancing without having constant cutaways to the judges or the audience (as in current American TV dance competitions. I don't know about you, but I watch dance shows for the dancing). There are no deep plot twists to be analyzed, no characters I need to understand better...but we definitely plan to watch this again because the dancing is really good. If you liked this, you will enjoy Best in Show.

    I thought this movie was great. I watched it in my freshman Spanish class and I just can't get enough! It's just SO FUNNY! I love the dancing scenes in this movie, especially the dad! He is hilarious. I hope to watch this with my family sometime in the near future, they love stuff like this just as much as me. I give this movie ten stars, multiplied by 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000! I watched it, always wanting more time to watch, because we only have 45 minute Spanish classes. This movie is a never ending laugh-fest, except for a few rather tense scenes, but even those are a little funny. I was reminded of Dirty Dancing, what with the whole "jerk dancer means prospective rookie" plot line.

    The plot follows a predictable line and some characters are stereotyped to the verge of spoof - a notion not half helped by the hilarious Ausssie accents. However the acting, editing and humor overcome this and turn it into a really great-fun-to-watch movie - and not just for dance lovers. This is an underrated movie with great romantic scenes alternating with tense moments and topped with a good climax. A better, non-repetitive and more imaginative soundtrack would have made it into a classic. Paul Mercurio's acting and dancing glue the movie together. Antonio Vargas adds weight to the cast and shows everyone what real dance is. Armonia Benedito as Fran's grandma is a real gem. Recommended.

    Here, the movie starts in the Waratah Championships, a setup for the big Pan-Pacific Ballroom Championships later on. Scott Hastings had already danced a great Viennese waltz with former partner Liz Holt, and then, as the scene shifts to samba, Scott Hastings starts out great with Liz, and then, in the middle of the samba version of "Tequila" in the background, Scott explodes and does his overkill-laden solo trick steps way beyond what Liz could follow. Les Kendall, Scott's dance coach, explains the reason why Scott wanted to free himself--in the start of the samba, Les said that he was "boxed-in" by Ken Rallings and Tina Sparkles, which caused Scott to release a freedom type of dancing anger. Liz tries to keep up with Scott's unacceptable solo dance showmanship but then, Australian Dance Council chairman, Barry Fife, penalizes that couple major points causing Ken and Tina to win the Waratah title. Liz then finally cuts off her dance partnership with Scott after the competition at the next scene in the Kendall Dance Studio. Then, a new beginning dance partner, Fran, accosts Scott at the studio and make a ruse to be new partners and practice their routine in light of the upcoming Pan-Pacific Dance Championships. Fran's flamenco dance ability is given away a bit when she demonstrates a short tap sequence. Learning from the dancesport debacle in Waratah, Scott is still stubborn and decides to strongly bend the dancesport rules with "new steps" for the Pan-Pacific championships to try to impress Barry Fife. Barry is not happy about it and decides that Scott's "new steps" will never, ever be in the books in competition as long as Fife remains in power in Australian dancesport. In the middle of the movie, Tina Sparkle decides to retire from her partnership from Ken Railings, doing their final honor dance at a pre- competition social ballroom dance party, while at the same time, Scott and Fran, do a theatrical dance in quasi-silhouette to "Perhaps Perhaps Perhaps." This is where the disapproval of their partnership increases. Les Kendall now warns Scott that if you dance with Fran, you will never win the Pan-Pacific competition, but then suggests to Scott that if you partner up with Tina, you will have a 100 percent shot of winning the Pan-Pacific title. But then, Fran and Scott are caught by Fran's flamenco music family, forcing them to dance a paso doble, and then, eventually, Fran's father then teaches him the authentic Spanish paso doble. The solo focusing of the paso is the beginning of the recipe for almost total disaster on the start of the Pan-Pacific championships. In the appetizer paso doble heat in the competition floor, Fran does dance with an unknown lady, and then, as Scott arrives to face the forced partnering of Tina Sparkles with him for the Latin championship round, Scott decides at the last minute to dance with Fran in the second paso doble around with several professional Latin dance couples dancing. Barry Fife, already there, catches Fran and Scott in the action and orders the music powered down, and disqualifies both dancers for good. Fran and Scott, however, refuses to leave the floor and instead, with the help of Fran's family, dance a spectacular Spanish flamenco dance with strong paso feel, shocking the audience, and even Barry Fife himself. In the end, the audience comes out to the dance floor to get their chance to dance, and the guess is that even if disqualified--you can shock a crowd if you do a great unique dance, and that's what Fran and Scott did. They won their hearts, even if it is not a championship trophy!

    I had never heard of this film and started watching it just after the intro credits ran by. I immediately thought this was a John Waters film. I thought this until a commercial came on and they mentioned the name of the director. I was surprised. The female lead character in this film is introduced. She has stained, crooked teeth. Her hair looks like the Bride of Frankenstein's... only worn in a ponytail. And on her face she's got the worst case of pimples I've ever seen in my life. She is clumsy too and is dressed essentially in one of Andre the Giant's old dirty T shirts. As the movie progresses she gradually becomes quite attractive and nimble on her feet. I don't understand that. Is she still ugly, but we are seeing her looks improve by viewing her through the eyes of her dance partner, who is falling in love with her? A love is blind sort of thing? Or does her growing self confidence miraculously transform her teeth, hair, complexion and wardrobe? Discounting those questions that I kept asking myself, I though this was a pleasant film. No violence to speak of. No foul language. No sex. Just a nice little film where dancers with lots of talent have the opportunity to showcase their craft. There's no heavy plot to follow and get you thinking. Purely for the entertainment value of the dancers. I certainly DO NOT think this was an amazingly wonderful, great, 10 star movie. I wonder if everybody else saw the same film as me. Honestly it was better than average, but not by a whole lot.

    With the recent upsurge in popularity in and broadcasting of all things Ballroom and dancing and stuff, it seems I'm the only one I know that can resist it - and quite easily, at that. All that forced preening, pirouetting and showing off leaves me cold. Baz Lurhmann's debut film, Strictly Ballroom, however, at least actually gets me looking at the screen and not my toes. Whilst not getting quite as enraptured by its sparkly magic as much as some folk - and many critics, it is the story and the very human one at that shines through. Everyone who has a single DNA in their bodies that gives them an ounce of heart and compassion will soon appreciate this modern fairytale. Some of the styles are rather alarming, both in hair and fashion but that now adds to the film's charm and keeps the metabolism slightly uneven. Strangely, to me, it looks a little older than the 20 years that it is. For the rest of the population who do enjoy "Strictly" and those other shows will undoubtedly lap this one up. Not only do you get the swirly moves but a beautiful story, too.

    Absolutely brilliant; by the writer and the director and the actors. Shirley Hastings is one of the most important and true characters in any Art form. She is to be studied by students in psychology, psychiatry, and social work. As is her husband. Unfortunately the theme is all too common. The future is the youth. To stifle them is so wrong on so many levels. Narcissism abounds. It is epidemic and crippling to happiness and creativity. The hen-pecked husband is all too common in marriages. His realization of this is awaited by the audience throughout the movie...Does he ever break-away from the narcissistic dominating wife? How does one do this and keep a marriage together? How does a son break away from a mother? From a father? From both?

There's no heavy plot to follow and get you thinking. Purely for the entertainment value of the dancers. I certainly DO NOT think this was an amazingly wonderful, great, 10 star movie. I wonder if everybody else saw the same film as me. Honestly it was better than average, but not by a whole lot.

    With the recent upsurge in popularity in and broadcasting of all things Ballroom and dancing and stuff, it seems I'm the only one I know that can resist it - and quite easily, at that. All that forced preening, pirouetting and showing off leaves me cold. Baz Lurhmann's debut film, Strictly Ballroom, however, at least actually gets me looking at the screen and not my toes. Whilst not getting quite as enraptured by its sparkly magic as much as some folk - and many critics, it is the story and the very human one at that shines through. Everyone who has a single DNA in their bodies that gives them an ounce of heart and compassion will soon appreciate this modern fairytale. Some of the styles are rather alarming, both in hair and fashion but that now adds to the film's charm and keeps the metabolism slightly uneven. Strangely, to me, it looks a little older than the 20 years that it is. For the rest of the population who do enjoy "Strictly" and those other shows will undoubtedly lap this one up. Not only do you get the swirly moves but a beautiful story, too.

    Absolutely brilliant; by the writer and the director and the actors. Shirley Hastings is one of the most important and true characters in any Art form. She is to be studied by students in psychology, psychiatry, and social work. As is her husband. Unfortunately the theme is all too common. The future is the youth. To stifle them is so wrong on so many levels. Narcissism abounds. It is epidemic and crippling to happiness and creativity. The hen-pecked husband is all too common in marriages. His realization of this is awaited by the audience throughout the movie...Does he ever break-away from the narcissistic dominating wife? How does one do this and keep a marriage together? How does a son break away from a mother? From a father? From both?

    An entertaining low-budget Australian dancing and romance movie by Baz Luhrman. It is the first movie of his trilogy The Red Curtain. Strictly Ballroom is, in few words, the story of a ugly dancing duckling who finds her break-the-rules swan dancer. It is the story of Scott, a brilliant ballroom dancer trained in a prestigious dancing school since his childhood, who is to become the next Pan-Pacific champion if he follows traditional ballroom style and moves. However, he has a spirit of his own, a dancing creativity that he's trying to channel and express in front of the public. In his way to become himself as a dancer, he pairs -not previous begging and hard work- with beginner dancer Fran, a shy Spanish girl from a family of flamenco dancers. The movie has a predictable unoriginal story and stereotypical characters, but the script is light and funny, engaging and fresh, and a little bit Kitch but in a charming way. The musical numbers are danced with talent and great heart, and they are very enjoyable. I especially liked the funny retro images telling the story of Scott's dancing parents through dance, which are truly creative, theatrical, and delightful. To me, this is Baz Luhrman's most Australian movie, despite not pretending to be so. Definitely more Australian than his movie Australia, but much less pretentious and with much more heart. The movie presents a mix of true Australian characters, Anglosaxons and immigrants (in this case Spaniards), passionate people about competition and sports, always giving their best to win anything - hard working dreamers. Moreover, the characters and the story have a very Australian sense of humor, and the characters speak with a marked Australian strong accent, especially clear in Cariades' character. In fact, the characters and atmosphere somewhat reminded me of those unforgettable ones in the Australian film The Castle. Overall, the performances are very good. Paul Mercurio and Tana Merice are convincing and good in their acting and dancing. Paul Mercurio is really great in his dancing. All the supporting actors are terrific and nail their characters: Pat Thomson (who died before the movie was premiered) as Scott's mother Shirley, Barry Otto as Scott's father Doug, Gia Carides as Scott's first dancing partner Liz, Bill Hunter as the President of the Ballroom Australian Federation, and Peter Whitford as the owner and director of Les Kendall's Dance Academy. Antonio Vargas and Armonia Benedito are also very charming as Fran's father and grandma. An unpretentious light heart-warming entertaining movie, with lots of Spanish moments!

    Strictly Ballroom (1992) A campy, glossy, colorful, surprising fairy tale, total romance, lots of dancing, and inventive through and through. No, director Baz Luhmann has not pulled off another Moulin Rouge, which is a whole other order of invention and beauty, but this is his first movie, and it's filled with idealism. And some people to root for and to hiss against--you know, heroes and villains. It could have been tightened up, no doubt--there are times when I was a little impatient even though they were dancing away. But mostly I was happy to watch and wait for the next step toward the big climax. The two young leads, interestingly, came from nowhere (the perfectly named Paul Mercurio and the understated Tara Morice both in their first films). They've gone on to largely television careers, and in part you appreciate how much Luhmann gets from them. The highly stylized approach helps avoid a need for real acting, per se, but Mercurio in particular really rises to the occasion. The whole affair is Australian, and it feels bright and original the way some of fellow Aussie Peter Weir's films do, or in another sense, Peter Jackson. If you can summon up any innocence and romance and go for what really clicks here, be swept up and love it.

    So Strictly Ballroom. I don't know exactly what I was expecting of this movie, but it was definitely different from what I expected. But that is not to say that I did not enjoy it a ton. I thought it was overall a good and really fun movie. The music and dance throughout the movie, as pretty much a method of story telling, worked very well for the movie and keep the story meaningful and engaging. Some of the characters and lines were a bit outlandish, but all in all, it fit together remarkable well, and created an enjoyable experience. Even thought there was nothing overly remarkable about the story's main love interest plot between Fran and Scott, I felt that it still worked out well. The discussion of dance as a act of creating a perceived love as part of the act was interesting and something I have thought about before so I found it nice to be brought up in the movie (even if only for a few lines). I thought that most of then characters, though maybe a bit simple, really came together to create a pretty good story. My personal favorite character was Doug though (even before finding out about his secret). I thought his overall fairly eccentric character was a lot of fun and in ways very relatable. All in all, this was a fun movie. For anyone that is willing to give a bit of a different way to tell a story a chance I would recommend giving it a shot.

    I sure enjoyed it despite the complete lack of explosions or car chases. Where I'm coming from: I'm a 54 year old male who has danced for 15 years. My girlfriend has danced since she was 3. We don't compete because it would make our relaxing hobby a pressured nightmare (and, frankly, because I'm not very good). My daughter competed and did very well. Some reviewers apparently missed that this movie is a satire and it's supposed to be dumb and funny. Having sat through more competitions than I can count, I can state this movie hits the nail on the head. The parents, the kids, the beginners, the prima donnas...it's all true. Yes, it's really campy and schmaltzy, the plot has holes you could drive a truck through, the acting is sometimes marginal, but we both enjoyed it and laughed out loud. And what's the best part of this movie? The dancing. It is photographed and edited such that you can really see and enjoy the dancing without having constant cutaways to the judges or the audience (as in current American TV dance competitions. I don't know about you, but I watch dance shows for the dancing). There are no deep plot twists to be analyzed, no characters I need to understand better...but we definitely plan to watch this again because the dancing is really good. If you liked this, you will enjoy Best in Show.

    I thought this movie was great. I watched it in my freshman Spanish class and I just can't get enough! It's just SO FUNNY! I love the dancing scenes in this movie, especially the dad! He is hilarious. I hope to watch this with my family sometime in the near future, they love stuff like this just as much as me. I give this movie ten stars, multiplied by 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000! I watched it, always wanting more time to watch, because we only have 45 minute Spanish classes. This movie is a never ending laugh-fest, except for a few rather tense scenes, but even those are a little funny. I was reminded of Dirty Dancing, what with the whole "jerk dancer means prospective rookie" plot line.

    The plot follows a predictable line and some characters are stereotyped to the verge of spoof - a notion not half helped by the hilarious Ausssie accents. However the acting, editing and humor overcome this and turn it into a really great-fun-to-watch movie - and not just for dance lovers. This is an underrated movie with great romantic scenes alternating with tense moments and topped with a good climax. A better, non-repetitive and more imaginative soundtrack would have made it into a classic. Paul Mercurio's acting and dancing glue the movie together. Antonio Vargas adds weight to the cast and shows everyone what real dance is. Armonia Benedito as Fran's grandma is a real gem. Recommended.

    Here, the movie starts in the Waratah Championships, a setup for the big Pan-Pacific Ballroom Championships later on. Scott Hastings had already danced a great Viennese waltz with former partner Liz Holt, and then, as the scene shifts to samba, Scott Hastings starts out great with Liz, and then, in the middle of the samba version of "Tequila" in the background, Scott explodes and does his overkill-laden solo trick steps way beyond what Liz could follow. Les Kendall, Scott's dance coach, explains the reason why Scott wanted to free himself--in the start of the samba, Les said that he was "boxed-in" by Ken Rallings and Tina Sparkles, which caused Scott to release a freedom type of dancing anger. Liz tries to keep up with Scott's unacceptable solo dance showmanship but then, Australian Dance Council chairman, Barry Fife, penalizes that couple major points causing Ken and Tina to win the Waratah title. Liz then finally cuts off her dance partnership with Scott after the competition at the next scene in the Kendall Dance Studio. Then, a new beginning dance partner, Fran, accosts Scott at the studio and make a ruse to be new partners and practice their routine in light of the upcoming Pan-Pacific Dance Championships. Fran's flamenco dance ability is given away a bit when she demonstrates a short tap sequence. Learning from the dancesport debacle in Waratah, Scott is still stubborn and decides to strongly bend the dancesport rules with "new steps" for the Pan-Pacific championships to try to impress Barry Fife. Barry is not happy about it and decides that Scott's "new steps" will never, ever be in the books in competition as long as Fife remains in power in Australian dancesport. In the middle of the movie, Tina Sparkle decides to retire from her partnership from Ken Railings, doing their final honor dance at a pre- competition social ballroom dance party, while at the same time, Scott and Fran, do a theatrical dance in quasi-silhouette to "Perhaps Perhaps Perhaps." This is where the disapproval of their partnership increases. Les Kendall now warns Scott that if you dance with Fran, you will never win the Pan-Pacific competition, but then suggests to Scott that if you partner up with Tina, you will have a 100 percent shot of winning the Pan-Pacific title. But then, Fran and Scott are caught by Fran's flamenco music family, forcing them to dance a paso doble, and then, eventually, Fran's father then teaches him the authentic Spanish paso doble. The solo focusing of the paso is the beginning of the recipe for almost total disaster on the start of the Pan-Pacific championships. In the appetizer paso doble heat in the competition floor, Fran does dance with an unknown lady, and then, as Scott arrives to face the forced partnering of Tina Sparkles with him for the Latin championship round, Scott decides at the last minute to dance with Fran in the second paso doble around with several professional Latin dance couples dancing. Barry Fife, already there, catches Fran and Scott in the action and orders the music powered down, and disqualifies both dancers for good. Fran and Scott, however, refuses to leave the floor and instead, with the help of Fran's family, dance a spectacular Spanish flamenco dance with strong paso feel, shocking the audience, and even Barry Fife himself. In the end, the audience comes out to the dance floor to get their chance to dance, and the guess is that even if disqualified--you can shock a crowd if you do a great unique dance, and that's what Fran and Scott did. They won their hearts, even if it is not a championship trophy!

    I had never heard of this film and started watching it just after the intro credits ran by. I immediately thought this was a John Waters film. I thought this until a commercial came on and they mentioned the name of the director. I was surprised. The female lead character in this film is introduced. She has stained, crooked teeth. Her hair looks like the Bride of Frankenstein's... only worn in a ponytail. And on her face she's got the worst case of pimples I've ever seen in my life. She is clumsy too and is dressed essentially in one of Andre the Giant's old dirty T shirts. As the movie progresses she gradually becomes quite attractive and nimble on her feet. I don't understand that. Is she still ugly, but we are seeing her looks improve by viewing her through the eyes of her dance partner, who is falling in love with her? A love is blind sort of thing? Or does her growing self confidence miraculously transform her teeth, hair, complexion and wardrobe? Discounting those questions that I kept asking myself, I though this was a pleasant film. No violence to speak of. No foul language. No sex. Just a nice little film where dancers with lots of talent have the opportunity to showcase their craft. There's no heavy plot to follow and get you thinking. Purely for the entertainment value of the dancers. I certainly DO NOT think this was an amazingly wonderful, great, 10 star movie. I wonder if everybody else saw the same film as me. Honestly it was better than average, but not by a whole lot.

    With the recent upsurge in popularity in and broadcasting of all things Ballroom and dancing and stuff, it seems I'm the only one I know that can resist it - and quite easily, at that. All that forced preening, pirouetting and showing off leaves me cold. Baz Lurhmann's debut film, Strictly Ballroom, however, at least actually gets me looking at the screen and not my toes. Whilst not getting quite as enraptured by its sparkly magic as much as some folk - and many critics, it is the story and the very human one at that shines through. Everyone who has a single DNA in their bodies that gives them an ounce of heart and compassion will soon appreciate this modern fairytale. Some of the styles are rather alarming, both in hair and fashion but that now adds to the film's charm and keeps the metabolism slightly uneven. Strangely, to me, it looks a little older than the 20 years that it is. For the rest of the population who do enjoy "Strictly" and those other shows will undoubtedly lap this one up.

Barry is not happy about it and decides that Scott's "new steps" will never, ever be in the books in competition as long as Fife remains in power in Australian dancesport. In the middle of the movie, Tina Sparkle decides to retire from her partnership from Ken Railings, doing their final honor dance at a pre- competition social ballroom dance party, while at the same time, Scott and Fran, do a theatrical dance in quasi-silhouette to "Perhaps Perhaps Perhaps." This is where the disapproval of their partnership increases. Les Kendall now warns Scott that if you dance with Fran, you will never win the Pan-Pacific competition, but then suggests to Scott that if you partner up with Tina, you will have a 100 percent shot of winning the Pan-Pacific title. But then, Fran and Scott are caught by Fran's flamenco music family, forcing them to dance a paso doble, and then, eventually, Fran's father then teaches him the authentic Spanish paso doble. The solo focusing of the paso is the beginning of the recipe for almost total disaster on the start of the Pan-Pacific championships. In the appetizer paso doble heat in the competition floor, Fran does dance with an unknown lady, and then, as Scott arrives to face the forced partnering of Tina Sparkles with him for the Latin championship round, Scott decides at the last minute to dance with Fran in the second paso doble around with several professional Latin dance couples dancing. Barry Fife, already there, catches Fran and Scott in the action and orders the music powered down, and disqualifies both dancers for good. Fran and Scott, however, refuses to leave the floor and instead, with the help of Fran's family, dance a spectacular Spanish flamenco dance with strong paso feel, shocking the audience, and even Barry Fife himself. In the end, the audience comes out to the dance floor to get their chance to dance, and the guess is that even if disqualified--you can shock a crowd if you do a great unique dance, and that's what Fran and Scott did. They won their hearts, even if it is not a championship trophy!

    I had never heard of this film and started watching it just after the intro credits ran by. I immediately thought this was a John Waters film. I thought this until a commercial came on and they mentioned the name of the director. I was surprised. The female lead character in this film is introduced. She has stained, crooked teeth. Her hair looks like the Bride of Frankenstein's... only worn in a ponytail. And on her face she's got the worst case of pimples I've ever seen in my life. She is clumsy too and is dressed essentially in one of Andre the Giant's old dirty T shirts. As the movie progresses she gradually becomes quite attractive and nimble on her feet. I don't understand that. Is she still ugly, but we are seeing her looks improve by viewing her through the eyes of her dance partner, who is falling in love with her? A love is blind sort of thing? Or does her growing self confidence miraculously transform her teeth, hair, complexion and wardrobe? Discounting those questions that I kept asking myself, I though this was a pleasant film. No violence to speak of. No foul language. No sex. Just a nice little film where dancers with lots of talent have the opportunity to showcase their craft. There's no heavy plot to follow and get you thinking. Purely for the entertainment value of the dancers. I certainly DO NOT think this was an amazingly wonderful, great, 10 star movie. I wonder if everybody else saw the same film as me. Honestly it was better than average, but not by a whole lot.

    With the recent upsurge in popularity in and broadcasting of all things Ballroom and dancing and stuff, it seems I'm the only one I know that can resist it - and quite easily, at that. All that forced preening, pirouetting and showing off leaves me cold. Baz Lurhmann's debut film, Strictly Ballroom, however, at least actually gets me looking at the screen and not my toes. Whilst not getting quite as enraptured by its sparkly magic as much as some folk - and many critics, it is the story and the very human one at that shines through. Everyone who has a single DNA in their bodies that gives them an ounce of heart and compassion will soon appreciate this modern fairytale. Some of the styles are rather alarming, both in hair and fashion but that now adds to the film's charm and keeps the metabolism slightly uneven. Strangely, to me, it looks a little older than the 20 years that it is. For the rest of the population who do enjoy "Strictly" and those other shows will undoubtedly lap this one up. Not only do you get the swirly moves but a beautiful story, too.

    Absolutely brilliant; by the writer and the director and the actors. Shirley Hastings is one of the most important and true characters in any Art form. She is to be studied by students in psychology, psychiatry, and social work. As is her husband. Unfortunately the theme is all too common. The future is the youth. To stifle them is so wrong on so many levels. Narcissism abounds. It is epidemic and crippling to happiness and creativity. The hen-pecked husband is all too common in marriages. His realization of this is awaited by the audience throughout the movie...Does he ever break-away from the narcissistic dominating wife? How does one do this and keep a marriage together? How does a son break away from a mother? From a father? From both?

    An entertaining low-budget Australian dancing and romance movie by Baz Luhrman. It is the first movie of his trilogy The Red Curtain. Strictly Ballroom is, in few words, the story of a ugly dancing duckling who finds her break-the-rules swan dancer. It is the story of Scott, a brilliant ballroom dancer trained in a prestigious dancing school since his childhood, who is to become the next Pan-Pacific champion if he follows traditional ballroom style and moves. However, he has a spirit of his own, a dancing creativity that he's trying to channel and express in front of the public. In his way to become himself as a dancer, he pairs -not previous begging and hard work- with beginner dancer Fran, a shy Spanish girl from a family of flamenco dancers. The movie has a predictable unoriginal story and stereotypical characters, but the script is light and funny, engaging and fresh, and a little bit Kitch but in a charming way. The musical numbers are danced with talent and great heart, and they are very enjoyable. I especially liked the funny retro images telling the story of Scott's dancing parents through dance, which are truly creative, theatrical, and delightful. To me, this is Baz Luhrman's most Australian movie, despite not pretending to be so. Definitely more Australian than his movie Australia, but much less pretentious and with much more heart. The movie presents a mix of true Australian characters, Anglosaxons and immigrants (in this case Spaniards), passionate people about competition and sports, always giving their best to win anything - hard working dreamers. Moreover, the characters and the story have a very Australian sense of humor, and the characters speak with a marked Australian strong accent, especially clear in Cariades' character. In fact, the characters and atmosphere somewhat reminded me of those unforgettable ones in the Australian film The Castle. Overall, the performances are very good. Paul Mercurio and Tana Merice are convincing and good in their acting and dancing. Paul Mercurio is really great in his dancing. All the supporting actors are terrific and nail their characters: Pat Thomson (who died before the movie was premiered) as Scott's mother Shirley, Barry Otto as Scott's father Doug, Gia Carides as Scott's first dancing partner Liz, Bill Hunter as the President of the Ballroom Australian Federation, and Peter Whitford as the owner and director of Les Kendall's Dance Academy. Antonio Vargas and Armonia Benedito are also very charming as Fran's father and grandma. An unpretentious light heart-warming entertaining movie, with lots of Spanish moments!

    Strictly Ballroom (1992) A campy, glossy, colorful, surprising fairy tale, total romance, lots of dancing, and inventive through and through. No, director Baz Luhmann has not pulled off another Moulin Rouge, which is a whole other order of invention and beauty, but this is his first movie, and it's filled with idealism. And some people to root for and to hiss against--you know, heroes and villains. It could have been tightened up, no doubt--there are times when I was a little impatient even though they were dancing away. But mostly I was happy to watch and wait for the next step toward the big climax. The two young leads, interestingly, came from nowhere (the perfectly named Paul Mercurio and the understated Tara Morice both in their first films). They've gone on to largely television careers, and in part you appreciate how much Luhmann gets from them. The highly stylized approach helps avoid a need for real acting, per se, but Mercurio in particular really rises to the occasion. The whole affair is Australian, and it feels bright and original the way some of fellow Aussie Peter Weir's films do, or in another sense, Peter Jackson. If you can summon up any innocence and romance and go for what really clicks here, be swept up and love it.

    So Strictly Ballroom. I don't know exactly what I was expecting of this movie, but it was definitely different from what I expected. But that is not to say that I did not enjoy it a ton. I thought it was overall a good and really fun movie. The music and dance throughout the movie, as pretty much a method of story telling, worked very well for the movie and keep the story meaningful and engaging. Some of the characters and lines were a bit outlandish, but all in all, it fit together remarkable well, and created an enjoyable experience. Even thought there was nothing overly remarkable about the story's main love interest plot between Fran and Scott, I felt that it still worked out well. The discussion of dance as a act of creating a perceived love as part of the act was interesting and something I have thought about before so I found it nice to be brought up in the movie (even if only for a few lines). I thought that most of then characters, though maybe a bit simple, really came together to create a pretty good story. My personal favorite character was Doug though (even before finding out about his secret). I thought his overall fairly eccentric character was a lot of fun and in ways very relatable. All in all, this was a fun movie. For anyone that is willing to give a bit of a different way to tell a story a chance I would recommend giving it a shot.

    I sure enjoyed it despite the complete lack of explosions or car chases. Where I'm coming from: I'm a 54 year old male who has danced for 15 years. My girlfriend has danced since she was 3. We don't compete because it would make our relaxing hobby a pressured nightmare (and, frankly, because I'm not very good). My daughter competed and did very well. Some reviewers apparently missed that this movie is a satire and it's supposed to be dumb and funny. Having sat through more competitions than I can count, I can state this movie hits the nail on the head. The parents, the kids, the beginners, the prima donnas...it's all true. Yes, it's really campy and schmaltzy, the plot has holes you could drive a truck through, the acting is sometimes marginal, but we both enjoyed it and laughed out loud. And what's the best part of this movie? The dancing. It is photographed and edited such that you can really see and enjoy the dancing without having constant cutaways to the judges or the audience (as in current American TV dance competitions. I don't know about you, but I watch dance shows for the dancing). There are no deep plot twists to be analyzed, no characters I need to understand better...but we definitely plan to watch this again because the dancing is really good. If you liked this, you will enjoy Best in Show.

    I thought this movie was great. I watched it in my freshman Spanish class and I just can't get enough! It's just SO FUNNY! I love the dancing scenes in this movie, especially the dad! He is hilarious. I hope to watch this with my family sometime in the near future, they love stuff like this just as much as me. I give this movie ten stars, multiplied by 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000! I watched it, always wanting more time to watch, because we only have 45 minute Spanish classes. This movie is a never ending laugh-fest, except for a few rather tense scenes, but even those are a little funny. I was reminded of Dirty Dancing, what with the whole "jerk dancer means prospective rookie" plot line.

    The plot follows a predictable line and some characters are stereotyped to the verge of spoof - a notion not half helped by the hilarious Ausssie accents. However the acting, editing and humor overcome this and turn it into a really great-fun-to-watch movie - and not just for dance lovers. This is an underrated movie with great romantic scenes alternating with tense moments and topped with a good climax. A better, non-repetitive and more imaginative soundtrack would have made it into a classic. Paul Mercurio's acting and dancing glue the movie together. Antonio Vargas adds weight to the cast and shows everyone what real dance is. Armonia Benedito as Fran's grandma is a real gem. Recommended.

    Here, the movie starts in the Waratah Championships, a setup for the big Pan-Pacific Ballroom Championships later on. Scott Hastings had already danced a great Viennese waltz with former partner Liz Holt, and then, as the scene shifts to samba, Scott Hastings starts out great with Liz, and then, in the middle of the samba version of "Tequila" in the background, Scott explodes and does his overkill-laden solo trick steps way beyond what Liz could follow. Les Kendall, Scott's dance coach, explains the reason why Scott wanted to free himself--in the start of the samba, Les said that he was "boxed-in" by Ken Rallings and Tina Sparkles, which caused Scott to release a freedom type of dancing anger. Liz tries to keep up with Scott's unacceptable solo dance showmanship but then, Australian Dance Council chairman, Barry Fife, penalizes that couple major points causing Ken and Tina to win the Waratah title. Liz then finally cuts off her dance partnership with Scott after the competition at the next scene in the Kendall Dance Studio. Then, a new beginning dance partner, Fran, accosts Scott at the studio and make a ruse to be new partners and practice their routine in light of the upcoming Pan-Pacific Dance Championships. Fran's flamenco dance ability is given away a bit when she demonstrates a short tap sequence. Learning from the dancesport debacle in Waratah, Scott is still stubborn and decides to strongly bend the dancesport rules with "new steps" for the Pan-Pacific championships to try to impress Barry Fife. Barry is not happy about it and decides that Scott's "new steps" will never, ever be in the books in competition as long as Fife remains in power in Australian dancesport. In the middle of the movie, Tina Sparkle decides to retire from her partnership from Ken Railings, doing their final honor dance at a pre- competition social ballroom dance party, while at the same time, Scott and Fran, do a theatrical dance in quasi-silhouette to "Perhaps Perhaps Perhaps." This is where the disapproval of their partnership increases. Les Kendall now warns Scott that if you dance with Fran, you will never win the Pan-Pacific competition, but then suggests to Scott that if you partner up with Tina, you will have a 100 percent shot of winning the Pan-Pacific title. But then, Fran and Scott are caught by Fran's flamenco music family, forcing them to dance a paso doble, and then, eventually, Fran's father then teaches him the authentic Spanish paso doble. The solo focusing of the paso is the beginning of the recipe for almost total disaster on the start of the Pan-Pacific championships. In the appetizer paso doble heat in the competition floor, Fran does dance with an unknown lady, and then, as Scott arrives to face the forced partnering of Tina Sparkles with him for the Latin championship round, Scott decides at the last minute to dance with Fran in the second paso doble around with several professional Latin dance couples dancing. Barry Fife, already there, catches Fran and Scott in the action and orders the music powered down, and disqualifies both dancers for good. Fran and Scott, however, refuses to leave the floor and instead, with the help of Fran's family, dance a spectacular Spanish flamenco dance with strong paso feel, shocking the audience, and even Barry Fife himself. In the end, the audience comes out to the dance floor to get their chance to dance, and the guess is that even if disqualified--you can shock a crowd if you do a great unique dance, and that's what Fran and Scott did.

I give this movie ten stars, multiplied by 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000! I watched it, always wanting more time to watch, because we only have 45 minute Spanish classes. This movie is a never ending laugh-fest, except for a few rather tense scenes, but even those are a little funny. I was reminded of Dirty Dancing, what with the whole "jerk dancer means prospective rookie" plot line.

    The plot follows a predictable line and some characters are stereotyped to the verge of spoof - a notion not half helped by the hilarious Ausssie accents. However the acting, editing and humor overcome this and turn it into a really great-fun-to-watch movie - and not just for dance lovers. This is an underrated movie with great romantic scenes alternating with tense moments and topped with a good climax. A better, non-repetitive and more imaginative soundtrack would have made it into a classic. Paul Mercurio's acting and dancing glue the movie together. Antonio Vargas adds weight to the cast and shows everyone what real dance is. Armonia Benedito as Fran's grandma is a real gem. Recommended.

    Here, the movie starts in the Waratah Championships, a setup for the big Pan-Pacific Ballroom Championships later on. Scott Hastings had already danced a great Viennese waltz with former partner Liz Holt, and then, as the scene shifts to samba, Scott Hastings starts out great with Liz, and then, in the middle of the samba version of "Tequila" in the background, Scott explodes and does his overkill-laden solo trick steps way beyond what Liz could follow. Les Kendall, Scott's dance coach, explains the reason why Scott wanted to free himself--in the start of the samba, Les said that he was "boxed-in" by Ken Rallings and Tina Sparkles, which caused Scott to release a freedom type of dancing anger. Liz tries to keep up with Scott's unacceptable solo dance showmanship but then, Australian Dance Council chairman, Barry Fife, penalizes that couple major points causing Ken and Tina to win the Waratah title. Liz then finally cuts off her dance partnership with Scott after the competition at the next scene in the Kendall Dance Studio. Then, a new beginning dance partner, Fran, accosts Scott at the studio and make a ruse to be new partners and practice their routine in light of the upcoming Pan-Pacific Dance Championships. Fran's flamenco dance ability is given away a bit when she demonstrates a short tap sequence. Learning from the dancesport debacle in Waratah, Scott is still stubborn and decides to strongly bend the dancesport rules with "new steps" for the Pan-Pacific championships to try to impress Barry Fife. Barry is not happy about it and decides that Scott's "new steps" will never, ever be in the books in competition as long as Fife remains in power in Australian dancesport. In the middle of the movie, Tina Sparkle decides to retire from her partnership from Ken Railings, doing their final honor dance at a pre- competition social ballroom dance party, while at the same time, Scott and Fran, do a theatrical dance in quasi-silhouette to "Perhaps Perhaps Perhaps." This is where the disapproval of their partnership increases. Les Kendall now warns Scott that if you dance with Fran, you will never win the Pan-Pacific competition, but then suggests to Scott that if you partner up with Tina, you will have a 100 percent shot of winning the Pan-Pacific title. But then, Fran and Scott are caught by Fran's flamenco music family, forcing them to dance a paso doble, and then, eventually, Fran's father then teaches him the authentic Spanish paso doble. The solo focusing of the paso is the beginning of the recipe for almost total disaster on the start of the Pan-Pacific championships. In the appetizer paso doble heat in the competition floor, Fran does dance with an unknown lady, and then, as Scott arrives to face the forced partnering of Tina Sparkles with him for the Latin championship round, Scott decides at the last minute to dance with Fran in the second paso doble around with several professional Latin dance couples dancing. Barry Fife, already there, catches Fran and Scott in the action and orders the music powered down, and disqualifies both dancers for good. Fran and Scott, however, refuses to leave the floor and instead, with the help of Fran's family, dance a spectacular Spanish flamenco dance with strong paso feel, shocking the audience, and even Barry Fife himself. In the end, the audience comes out to the dance floor to get their chance to dance, and the guess is that even if disqualified--you can shock a crowd if you do a great unique dance, and that's what Fran and Scott did. They won their hearts, even if it is not a championship trophy!

    I had never heard of this film and started watching it just after the intro credits ran by. I immediately thought this was a John Waters film. I thought this until a commercial came on and they mentioned the name of the director. I was surprised. The female lead character in this film is introduced. She has stained, crooked teeth. Her hair looks like the Bride of Frankenstein's... only worn in a ponytail. And on her face she's got the worst case of pimples I've ever seen in my life. She is clumsy too and is dressed essentially in one of Andre the Giant's old dirty T shirts. As the movie progresses she gradually becomes quite attractive and nimble on her feet. I don't understand that. Is she still ugly, but we are seeing her looks improve by viewing her through the eyes of her dance partner, who is falling in love with her? A love is blind sort of thing? Or does her growing self confidence miraculously transform her teeth, hair, complexion and wardrobe? Discounting those questions that I kept asking myself, I though this was a pleasant film. No violence to speak of. No foul language. No sex. Just a nice little film where dancers with lots of talent have the opportunity to showcase their craft. There's no heavy plot to follow and get you thinking. Purely for the entertainment value of the dancers. I certainly DO NOT think this was an amazingly wonderful, great, 10 star movie. I wonder if everybody else saw the same film as me. Honestly it was better than average, but not by a whole lot.

    With the recent upsurge in popularity in and broadcasting of all things Ballroom and dancing and stuff, it seems I'm the only one I know that can resist it - and quite easily, at that. All that forced preening, pirouetting and showing off leaves me cold. Baz Lurhmann's debut film, Strictly Ballroom, however, at least actually gets me looking at the screen and not my toes. Whilst not getting quite as enraptured by its sparkly magic as much as some folk - and many critics, it is the story and the very human one at that shines through. Everyone who has a single DNA in their bodies that gives them an ounce of heart and compassion will soon appreciate this modern fairytale. Some of the styles are rather alarming, both in hair and fashion but that now adds to the film's charm and keeps the metabolism slightly uneven. Strangely, to me, it looks a little older than the 20 years that it is. For the rest of the population who do enjoy "Strictly" and those other shows will undoubtedly lap this one up. Not only do you get the swirly moves but a beautiful story, too.

    Absolutely brilliant; by the writer and the director and the actors. Shirley Hastings is one of the most important and true characters in any Art form. She is to be studied by students in psychology, psychiatry, and social work. As is her husband. Unfortunately the theme is all too common. The future is the youth. To stifle them is so wrong on so many levels. Narcissism abounds. It is epidemic and crippling to happiness and creativity. The hen-pecked husband is all too common in marriages. His realization of this is awaited by the audience throughout the movie...Does he ever break-away from the narcissistic dominating wife? How does one do this and keep a marriage together? How does a son break away from a mother? From a father? From both?

    An entertaining low-budget Australian dancing and romance movie by Baz Luhrman. It is the first movie of his trilogy The Red Curtain. Strictly Ballroom is, in few words, the story of a ugly dancing duckling who finds her break-the-rules swan dancer. It is the story of Scott, a brilliant ballroom dancer trained in a prestigious dancing school since his childhood, who is to become the next Pan-Pacific champion if he follows traditional ballroom style and moves. However, he has a spirit of his own, a dancing creativity that he's trying to channel and express in front of the public. In his way to become himself as a dancer, he pairs -not previous begging and hard work- with beginner dancer Fran, a shy Spanish girl from a family of flamenco dancers. The movie has a predictable unoriginal story and stereotypical characters, but the script is light and funny, engaging and fresh, and a little bit Kitch but in a charming way. The musical numbers are danced with talent and great heart, and they are very enjoyable. I especially liked the funny retro images telling the story of Scott's dancing parents through dance, which are truly creative, theatrical, and delightful. To me, this is Baz Luhrman's most Australian movie, despite not pretending to be so. Definitely more Australian than his movie Australia, but much less pretentious and with much more heart. The movie presents a mix of true Australian characters, Anglosaxons and immigrants (in this case Spaniards), passionate people about competition and sports, always giving their best to win anything - hard working dreamers. Moreover, the characters and the story have a very Australian sense of humor, and the characters speak with a marked Australian strong accent, especially clear in Cariades' character. In fact, the characters and atmosphere somewhat reminded me of those unforgettable ones in the Australian film The Castle. Overall, the performances are very good. Paul Mercurio and Tana Merice are convincing and good in their acting and dancing. Paul Mercurio is really great in his dancing. All the supporting actors are terrific and nail their characters: Pat Thomson (who died before the movie was premiered) as Scott's mother Shirley, Barry Otto as Scott's father Doug, Gia Carides as Scott's first dancing partner Liz, Bill Hunter as the President of the Ballroom Australian Federation, and Peter Whitford as the owner and director of Les Kendall's Dance Academy. Antonio Vargas and Armonia Benedito are also very charming as Fran's father and grandma. An unpretentious light heart-warming entertaining movie, with lots of Spanish moments!

    Strictly Ballroom (1992) A campy, glossy, colorful, surprising fairy tale, total romance, lots of dancing, and inventive through and through. No, director Baz Luhmann has not pulled off another Moulin Rouge, which is a whole other order of invention and beauty, but this is his first movie, and it's filled with idealism. And some people to root for and to hiss against--you know, heroes and villains. It could have been tightened up, no doubt--there are times when I was a little impatient even though they were dancing away. But mostly I was happy to watch and wait for the next step toward the big climax. The two young leads, interestingly, came from nowhere (the perfectly named Paul Mercurio and the understated Tara Morice both in their first films). They've gone on to largely television careers, and in part you appreciate how much Luhmann gets from them. The highly stylized approach helps avoid a need for real acting, per se, but Mercurio in particular really rises to the occasion. The whole affair is Australian, and it feels bright and original the way some of fellow Aussie Peter Weir's films do, or in another sense, Peter Jackson. If you can summon up any innocence and romance and go for what really clicks here, be swept up and love it.

    So Strictly Ballroom. I don't know exactly what I was expecting of this movie, but it was definitely different from what I expected. But that is not to say that I did not enjoy it a ton. I thought it was overall a good and really fun movie. The music and dance throughout the movie, as pretty much a method of story telling, worked very well for the movie and keep the story meaningful and engaging. Some of the characters and lines were a bit outlandish, but all in all, it fit together remarkable well, and created an enjoyable experience. Even thought there was nothing overly remarkable about the story's main love interest plot between Fran and Scott, I felt that it still worked out well. The discussion of dance as a act of creating a perceived love as part of the act was interesting and something I have thought about before so I found it nice to be brought up in the movie (even if only for a few lines). I thought that most of then characters, though maybe a bit simple, really came together to create a pretty good story. My personal favorite character was Doug though (even before finding out about his secret). I thought his overall fairly eccentric character was a lot of fun and in ways very relatable. All in all, this was a fun movie. For anyone that is willing to give a bit of a different way to tell a story a chance I would recommend giving it a shot.

    I sure enjoyed it despite the complete lack of explosions or car chases. Where I'm coming from: I'm a 54 year old male who has danced for 15 years. My girlfriend has danced since she was 3. We don't compete because it would make our relaxing hobby a pressured nightmare (and, frankly, because I'm not very good). My daughter competed and did very well. Some reviewers apparently missed that this movie is a satire and it's supposed to be dumb and funny. Having sat through more competitions than I can count, I can state this movie hits the nail on the head. The parents, the kids, the beginners, the prima donnas...it's all true. Yes, it's really campy and schmaltzy, the plot has holes you could drive a truck through, the acting is sometimes marginal, but we both enjoyed it and laughed out loud. And what's the best part of this movie? The dancing. It is photographed and edited such that you can really see and enjoy the dancing without having constant cutaways to the judges or the audience (as in current American TV dance competitions. I don't know about you, but I watch dance shows for the dancing). There are no deep plot twists to be analyzed, no characters I need to understand better...but we definitely plan to watch this again because the dancing is really good. If you liked this, you will enjoy Best in Show.
