 <sinopse>
  John McClane and a Harlem store owner are targeted by German terrorist Simon Gruber in New York City, where he plans to rob the Federal Reserve Building.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  John McClane is now almost a full-blown alcoholic and is suspended from the NYPD. But when a bomb goes off in the Bonwit Teller Department Store the police go insane trying to figure out what's going on. Soon, a man named Simon calls and asks for McClane. Simon tells Inspector Walter Cobb that McClane is going to play a game called "Simon Says". He says that McClane is going to do the tasks he assigns him. If not, he'll blow off another bomb. With the help of a Harlem electrician, John McClane must race all over New York trying to figure out the frustrating puzzles that the crafty terrorist gives him. But when a bomb goes off in a subway station right by the Federal Reserve (the biggest gold storage in the world) things start to get heated up.

    This movie doesn't get enough love if you ask me. Die Hard With a Vengeance is a pulse pounding, explosive and smart action movie that actually almost comes close to trumping the original Die Hard if you ask me. In this movie, Simon Gruber (Jeremy Irons), brother of Hans Gruber, is out for revenge on John McClane, now in his hometown of New York City, for killing his brother at the Nakatomi Plaza that Christmas Eve of 1988, while attempting to steal the gold from the Federal Reserve's gold vault. Paired up with a pawn shop owner named Zeus (Samuel L Jackson) it's up to them to solve Simon's cryptic phone calls by playing a game of "Simon Says." This movie somewhat deviates away from the original's idea of one man trapped in a location, which I actually really like seeing as though some originality is needed in a sequel or it'll just be considered a rehash. Add in terrific chemistry between Willis and Jackson, who really should be in more movies together, along with explosive action and a great villain, Die Hard 3 is a near perfect follow up to the original and in my opinion the best sequel in the franchise. 9.5/10

    Die Hard director John McTiernan returns for this second sequel to his 1988 action classic, which sees Bruce Willis once again playing tough NY cop John McClane, this time being sent on a wild-goose chase around the Big Apple in the company of Harlem 'good Samaritan' Zeus Carver (Samuel L. Jackson) while evil Euro-villain Simon Gruber (Jeremy Irons) breaks into the city's Federal Gold Reserve. Full of the incredible explosive set-pieces that one has come to expect of the series, Die Hard: With a Vengeance certainly delivers in terms of sheer spectacle, but with Jackson's Carver in tow, one-time 'lone cowboy' McClane has now become one half of a comedy act, the film working more like an 80s buddy movie as a result. As the film reaches its climax, McClane also begins to exhibit signs of the superhero style powers of invincibility that made Live Free or Die Hard such a let-down. It's not enough to make me dislike the filmI still had a lot of fun with this onebut it is a worrying sign of things to come 7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.

    John McClane is back and better than ever. He is back in New York and currently on suspension. That is until Simon plays his game. Simon has McClane and Zeus Carver traipsing all over New York playing little games. McClane and Carver play along until McClane figures out that everything that Simon is putting them through is nothing but a wild goose chase. Simon turns out to be Simon Gruber, brother to Hans Gruber. Hans as you remember was killed by McClane in Calafornia several years before. Simon is bent on revenge... and gets pretty damn close. McClane does what he does best. He figures what Simon is really up to... the same thing that Hans was up to in California. Basically it's a heist, but the way everything is done is what makes the story so great. Bruce Willis brings his best to this role, as he has done twice before. I still maintain that if Willis had not been cast in this role there is not telling how successful the Die Hard franchise would have done. Bruce Willis IS John McClane. Jeremy Irons brings a different aspect to the story as Simon. The revenge angle has been done before but with the twist of the heist is a bit different. Samuel L. Jackson as Zeus Carver was a great move. Imagining someone else in any of these roles is unimaginable. The pace for this movie from beginning to end is fast, barely letting up for a breather. I give this 10 stars out of 10.

    "Die Hard with a Vengeance" is essentially the victim of overthinking. Different scripts were considered, and rejected for whatever reasons. In the end, they took a script by Jonathan Hensleigh (the very unfortunate screenwriter of Michael Bay trainwrecks like "The Rock" and "Armageddon") and tweaked it a little to make this movie. The first half goes okay enough. When the movie leaves Manhattan, it becomes a jumble of random action scenes. There is no real narrative consistency, it just meanders. I know they wanted to not make a "Die Hard on a Boat," etc. But, by going the opposite direction and having a dozen different locations, it just makes it seem like they patched it together as they went along. The performances are good, in general. Willis is always ready to go. But, Sam Jackson just does his angry black man routine, like he has in most of his movies. John McTiernan is a good director, but is one of those directors who shoots the script he's given. So, if it's a messed-up script, he shoots it without questioning it. After the movie goes on and on in its last hour, you want to just wrap it up. A major problem here is that they give McClane a sidekick, which he certainly doesn't need! I think that the producers and everyone else got freaked out by the fact that McClane talks to himself in the first two movies. So, they give him a sidekick. This has continued ever since. I think people just can't handle it if someone isn't psychologically right down the middle. So, if you have a guy talking to himself, people think "Can't have that!" Plus, gone is producer Joel Silver, who made the first two movies. This time, it's in the heavyhanded grasp of the producers who did "Rambo." So, there's gotta be a lot of blood and crazy-ass action, with little humor or sense of character. So it is with this movie, and the others that followed. The final action scene is good, but comes too late to make a difference. I know lots of people love this "Die Hard," but it does nothing for me, either then when I first saw it or now. In fact, when I saw it on opening day, I was in such shock that they actually made this the third "Die Hard" that I gave it a "B" on the CinemaScore card, when I actually would've given it an "F" if I were of sound mind at the time! * (1 Out of 10 Stars)

    A better film than Die Hard 2, though still not in the same league as the first one. This sees the city of New York as the battleground for John McClane, who finds himself targeted for revenge by a terrorist, and gaining help from Harlem storekeeper Zeus - Samuel L Jackson, who proves to be a terrific companion to John. The film gets off to a good start, with the pace rarely stopping to take a breath. At about the midway point, we see the true intentions of the main villain - a plot that smacks more than a bit of Goldfinger. When John realises the whole bomb plot by 'Simon' - Jeremy Irons - was actually to decoy police away from his intended target, it becomes a race against time to hunt him down. Where the film loses points a little is the somewhat weak finale, nowhere near as good as the climaxes for either the first two, though it should be noted the original intended ending was just plain bad. Until it stumbles at the end, another great ride for John McClane

    Once again, another Die Hard film is successful as this one does things a little differently then the other two but with a vengeance. I liked having Samuel Jackson in the film, teaming up with Willis as the two made a strong duo in maybe the craziest of then two films as this is filled with racial discrimination, riddles, and revenge. Jeremy Irons is very good as the new bad guy with a motive that did not have to be used but didn't ruin it for me anyway. The dialog was at its best in this film as it blurts out random things that are funny and corny. The characters are fine, the action and dialog are good and the setting is set downtown. I wish the wife was just killed off instead of moving again and these films are losing a little bit of its touch as it goes along, but I can never hate a Die Hard movie.

    Not much ado about how humor should be incorporated into it, DHWV is an absolute thriller and the most aspiring movie of the series till the fourth came into being. Bruce Willis impeccable, but in this, Jackson gives him a tough fight... man, what a performance by him, my mind was blown. Story is not pretty straightforward and the plot revolved around what I call is sweet, because the movie-watching experience doubles as things gel to John McClain as they do to you unless you are a smart-ass. Screenplay is pretty good and the music is better than DH2. BOTTOM LINE: This third movies in the beloved action series is a windy action flick, every DH fan should watch and follow! This one involved no love and lesser humor compared to the predecessors and talks solely about action, action & action. 9/10 Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES Language: Mediocre | Sex: Mild | Nudity: No | Foreplay & Mouth-Kiss: very Mild | Violence: Infinity raise to Infinity | Gore: Critical | Alcohol, Smoking or Drugs: No | Traumatizing Factor: Strong

    John McClaine once again returns as hard-edged cop after slightly worse Die Hard sequel, in another action-explosive filled pack adventure and reuniting with terrific John McTiernan (directed first 1988 film). This time setting is New York. McClaine is suspended, under divorce and drinking. Mysterious Simon has place several bombs throughout the city and needs for McClaine to co-operate, otherwise he'll blow another location (in opening sequence, he destroys department store). However, Simon holds another plan... and McClaine is only one who can stop him, with the help of black man Zeus Carver (Samuel L. Jackson). And all this sets the mood for frenetic chase through New York and ferocious action sequences. Yes, McTiernan is really fantastic action director. Plot is witty and never gets boring. Willis and Jackson are having great chemistry together, regardless this is not buddy cop movie. Soundtrack is simply memorable. Tasks (or riddles) that Simon provides for McClaine are always imaginative and do well for the overall plot. And, for the conclusion... My choice is still original feature, still remains as seminal action film. But this one is almost as the first one, Willis and Mctiernan are back and movie itself is an vast improvement over two recent entries, which I want to forget as soon as possible.

    Bruce Willis reprises his role as Detective Lieutenant John McClane in director John McTiernan's crime thriller "Die Hard with a Vengeance" with Samuel L. Jackson co-starring as a racist African-American. McClane is back with the New York Police Department, but he has been on suspension. McClane teams up with Zeus Carver to battle with a master criminal who has orchestrated the caper of a life-time. These two opposites meet in Harlem when McClane is dispatched across 110th Street and forced to wear a set of wooden sandwich boards with the N-word written on it. What we don't learn until later on is the villainous Simon Peter Gruber is related to Hans Gruber in "Die Hard," and he is exacting revenge while he steals the Federal Reserve Bank Depository blind. Simon Gruber (Jeremy Irons of "Damage") keeps our heroes trotting along over New York City on his random errands. Zeus finds himself stuck with McClane and Samuel L. Jackson enlivens things considerably with his hot-headed character. There are more than enough thrills to keep our attention.

    This movie is exciting, fast and thrilling; it rides hard on the action leaving little room for story depth just straight forward action with unbelievable acting by the leads and the movie did not have any of the other main cast from the first two movies, regardless this movie is just a wonderful action movie that we all should get the thrill of seeing. This is one wonderful Die Hard addition, as our hero is paired with another great actor Samuel L. Jackson as McClane goes up against a vengeful terrorist, who is here for one reason payback as McClane took down his brother in the first Die Hard movie but payback was just part of the check list also making out with over 140 billion in gold from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was also part of that list. The movie starts with a big explosion, and unlike the first two McClane was in full control of what was going on, a twist from the previous 2 films and a welcome twist if I can say so myself. The second Die Hard movie (Die Hard 2: Die Harder) ended with McClane and Holly walking off happy, this starts with McClane all washed up from a split from his wife. I love this movie, and Simon says, "Everyone should go see this" because to me this movie was better than the second in the franchise. www.lagsreviews.com

    This movie is exciting, fast and thrilling; it rides hard on the action leaving little room for story depth just straight forward action with unbelievable acting by the leads and the movie did not have any of the other main cast from the first two movies, regardless this movie is just a wonderful action movie that we all should get the thrill of seeing. This is one wonderful Die Hard addition, as our hero is paired with another great actor Samuel L. Jackson as McClane goes up against a vengeful terrorist, who is here for one reason payback as McClane took down his brother in the first Die Hard movie but payback was just part of the check list also making out with over 140 billion in gold from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was also part of that list. The movie starts with a big explosion, and unlike the first two McClane was in full control of what was going on, a twist from the previous 2 films and a welcome twist if I can say so myself. The second Die Hard movie (Die Hard 2: Die Harder) ended with McClane and Holly walking off happy, this starts with McClane all washed up from a split from his wife. I love this movie, and Simon says, "Everyone should go see this" because to me this movie was better than the second in the franchise. www.lagsreviews.com

    This movie doesn't get enough love if you ask me. Die Hard With a Vengeance is a pulse pounding, explosive and smart action movie that actually almost comes close to trumping the original Die Hard if you ask me. In this movie, Simon Gruber (Jeremy Irons), brother of Hans Gruber, is out for revenge on John McClane, now in his hometown of New York City, for killing his brother at the Nakatomi Plaza that Christmas Eve of 1988, while attempting to steal the gold from the Federal Reserve's gold vault. Paired up with a pawn shop owner named Zeus (Samuel L Jackson) it's up to them to solve Simon's cryptic phone calls by playing a game of "Simon Says." This movie somewhat deviates away from the original's idea of one man trapped in a location, which I actually really like seeing as though some originality is needed in a sequel or it'll just be considered a rehash. Add in terrific chemistry between Willis and Jackson, who really should be in more movies together, along with explosive action and a great villain, Die Hard 3 is a near perfect follow up to the original and in my opinion the best sequel in the franchise. 9.5/10

    Die Hard director John McTiernan returns for this second sequel to his 1988 action classic, which sees Bruce Willis once again playing tough NY cop John McClane, this time being sent on a wild-goose chase around the Big Apple in the company of Harlem 'good Samaritan' Zeus Carver (Samuel L. Jackson) while evil Euro-villain Simon Gruber (Jeremy Irons) breaks into the city's Federal Gold Reserve. Full of the incredible explosive set-pieces that one has come to expect of the series, Die Hard: With a Vengeance certainly delivers in terms of sheer spectacle, but with Jackson's Carver in tow, one-time 'lone cowboy' McClane has now become one half of a comedy act, the film working more like an 80s buddy movie as a result. As the film reaches its climax, McClane also begins to exhibit signs of the superhero style powers of invincibility that made Live Free or Die Hard such a let-down. It's not enough to make me dislike the filmI still had a lot of fun with this onebut it is a worrying sign of things to come 7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.

    John McClane is back and better than ever. He is back in New York and currently on suspension. That is until Simon plays his game. Simon has McClane and Zeus Carver traipsing all over New York playing little games. McClane and Carver play along until McClane figures out that everything that Simon is putting them through is nothing but a wild goose chase. Simon turns out to be Simon Gruber, brother to Hans Gruber. Hans as you remember was killed by McClane in Calafornia several years before. Simon is bent on revenge... and gets pretty damn close. McClane does what he does best. He figures what Simon is really up to... the same thing that Hans was up to in California. Basically it's a heist, but the way everything is done is what makes the story so great. Bruce Willis brings his best to this role, as he has done twice before. I still maintain that if Willis had not been cast in this role there is not telling how successful the Die Hard franchise would have done. Bruce Willis IS John McClane. Jeremy Irons brings a different aspect to the story as Simon. The revenge angle has been done before but with the twist of the heist is a bit different. Samuel L. Jackson as Zeus Carver was a great move. Imagining someone else in any of these roles is unimaginable. The pace for this movie from beginning to end is fast, barely letting up for a breather. I give this 10 stars out of 10.

    "Die Hard with a Vengeance" is essentially the victim of overthinking. Different scripts were considered, and rejected for whatever reasons. In the end, they took a script by Jonathan Hensleigh (the very unfortunate screenwriter of Michael Bay trainwrecks like "The Rock" and "Armageddon") and tweaked it a little to make this movie. The first half goes okay enough. When the movie leaves Manhattan, it becomes a jumble of random action scenes. There is no real narrative consistency, it just meanders. I know they wanted to not make a "Die Hard on a Boat," etc. But, by going the opposite direction and having a dozen different locations, it just makes it seem like they patched it together as they went along. The performances are good, in general. Willis is always ready to go. But, Sam Jackson just does his angry black man routine, like he has in most of his movies. John McTiernan is a good director, but is one of those directors who shoots the script he's given. So, if it's a messed-up script, he shoots it without questioning it. After the movie goes on and on in its last hour, you want to just wrap it up. A major problem here is that they give McClane a sidekick, which he certainly doesn't need! I think that the producers and everyone else got freaked out by the fact that McClane talks to himself in the first two movies. So, they give him a sidekick. This has continued ever since. I think people just can't handle it if someone isn't psychologically right down the middle. So, if you have a guy talking to himself, people think "Can't have that!" Plus, gone is producer Joel Silver, who made the first two movies. This time, it's in the heavyhanded grasp of the producers who did "Rambo." So, there's gotta be a lot of blood and crazy-ass action, with little humor or sense of character. So it is with this movie, and the others that followed. The final action scene is good, but comes too late to make a difference. I know lots of people love this "Die Hard," but it does nothing for me, either then when I first saw it or now. In fact, when I saw it on opening day, I was in such shock that they actually made this the third "Die Hard" that I gave it a "B" on the CinemaScore card, when I actually would've given it an "F" if I were of sound mind at the time! * (1 Out of 10 Stars)

    A better film than Die Hard 2, though still not in the same league as the first one. This sees the city of New York as the battleground for John McClane, who finds himself targeted for revenge by a terrorist, and gaining help from Harlem storekeeper Zeus - Samuel L Jackson, who proves to be a terrific companion to John. The film gets off to a good start, with the pace rarely stopping to take a breath. At about the midway point, we see the true intentions of the main villain - a plot that smacks more than a bit of Goldfinger. When John realises the whole bomb plot by 'Simon' - Jeremy Irons - was actually to decoy police away from his intended target, it becomes a race against time to hunt him down. Where the film loses points a little is the somewhat weak finale, nowhere near as good as the climaxes for either the first two, though it should be noted the original intended ending was just plain bad. Until it stumbles at the end, another great ride for John McClane

    Once again, another Die Hard film is successful as this one does things a little differently then the other two but with a vengeance. I liked having Samuel Jackson in the film, teaming up with Willis as the two made a strong duo in maybe the craziest of then two films as this is filled with racial discrimination, riddles, and revenge. Jeremy Irons is very good as the new bad guy with a motive that did not have to be used but didn't ruin it for me anyway. The dialog was at its best in this film as it blurts out random things that are funny and corny. The characters are fine, the action and dialog are good and the setting is set downtown. I wish the wife was just killed off instead of moving again and these films are losing a little bit of its touch as it goes along, but I can never hate a Die Hard movie.

    Not much ado about how humor should be incorporated into it, DHWV is an absolute thriller and the most aspiring movie of the series till the fourth came into being. Bruce Willis impeccable, but in this, Jackson gives him a tough fight... man, what a performance by him, my mind was blown. Story is not pretty straightforward and the plot revolved around what I call is sweet, because the movie-watching experience doubles as things gel to John McClain as they do to you unless you are a smart-ass. Screenplay is pretty good and the music is better than DH2. BOTTOM LINE: This third movies in the beloved action series is a windy action flick, every DH fan should watch and follow! This one involved no love and lesser humor compared to the predecessors and talks solely about action, action & action. 9/10 Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES Language: Mediocre | Sex: Mild | Nudity: No | Foreplay & Mouth-Kiss: very Mild | Violence: Infinity raise to Infinity | Gore: Critical | Alcohol, Smoking or Drugs: No | Traumatizing Factor: Strong

    John McClaine once again returns as hard-edged cop after slightly worse Die Hard sequel, in another action-explosive filled pack adventure and reuniting with terrific John McTiernan (directed first 1988 film). This time setting is New York. McClaine is suspended, under divorce and drinking. Mysterious Simon has place several bombs throughout the city and needs for McClaine to co-operate, otherwise he'll blow another location (in opening sequence, he destroys department store). However, Simon holds another plan... and McClaine is only one who can stop him, with the help of black man Zeus Carver (Samuel L. Jackson). And all this sets the mood for frenetic chase through New York and ferocious action sequences. Yes, McTiernan is really fantastic action director. Plot is witty and never gets boring. Willis and Jackson are having great chemistry together, regardless this is not buddy cop movie. Soundtrack is simply memorable. Tasks (or riddles) that Simon provides for McClaine are always imaginative and do well for the overall plot. And, for the conclusion... My choice is still original feature, still remains as seminal action film. But this one is almost as the first one, Willis and Mctiernan are back and movie itself is an vast improvement over two recent entries, which I want to forget as soon as possible.

    Bruce Willis reprises his role as Detective Lieutenant John McClane in director John McTiernan's crime thriller "Die Hard with a Vengeance" with Samuel L. Jackson co-starring as a racist African-American. McClane is back with the New York Police Department, but he has been on suspension. McClane teams up with Zeus Carver to battle with a master criminal who has orchestrated the caper of a life-time. These two opposites meet in Harlem when McClane is dispatched across 110th Street and forced to wear a set of wooden sandwich boards with the N-word written on it. What we don't learn until later on is the villainous Simon Peter Gruber is related to Hans Gruber in "Die Hard," and he is exacting revenge while he steals the Federal Reserve Bank Depository blind. Simon Gruber (Jeremy Irons of "Damage") keeps our heroes trotting along over New York City on his random errands. Zeus finds himself stuck with McClane and Samuel L. Jackson enlivens things considerably with his hot-headed character. There are more than enough thrills to keep our attention.

The movie starts with a big explosion, and unlike the first two McClane was in full control of what was going on, a twist from the previous 2 films and a welcome twist if I can say so myself. The second Die Hard movie (Die Hard 2: Die Harder) ended with McClane and Holly walking off happy, this starts with McClane all washed up from a split from his wife. I love this movie, and Simon says, "Everyone should go see this" because to me this movie was better than the second in the franchise. www.lagsreviews.com

    This movie doesn't get enough love if you ask me. Die Hard With a Vengeance is a pulse pounding, explosive and smart action movie that actually almost comes close to trumping the original Die Hard if you ask me. In this movie, Simon Gruber (Jeremy Irons), brother of Hans Gruber, is out for revenge on John McClane, now in his hometown of New York City, for killing his brother at the Nakatomi Plaza that Christmas Eve of 1988, while attempting to steal the gold from the Federal Reserve's gold vault. Paired up with a pawn shop owner named Zeus (Samuel L Jackson) it's up to them to solve Simon's cryptic phone calls by playing a game of "Simon Says." This movie somewhat deviates away from the original's idea of one man trapped in a location, which I actually really like seeing as though some originality is needed in a sequel or it'll just be considered a rehash. Add in terrific chemistry between Willis and Jackson, who really should be in more movies together, along with explosive action and a great villain, Die Hard 3 is a near perfect follow up to the original and in my opinion the best sequel in the franchise. 9.5/10

    Die Hard director John McTiernan returns for this second sequel to his 1988 action classic, which sees Bruce Willis once again playing tough NY cop John McClane, this time being sent on a wild-goose chase around the Big Apple in the company of Harlem 'good Samaritan' Zeus Carver (Samuel L. Jackson) while evil Euro-villain Simon Gruber (Jeremy Irons) breaks into the city's Federal Gold Reserve. Full of the incredible explosive set-pieces that one has come to expect of the series, Die Hard: With a Vengeance certainly delivers in terms of sheer spectacle, but with Jackson's Carver in tow, one-time 'lone cowboy' McClane has now become one half of a comedy act, the film working more like an 80s buddy movie as a result. As the film reaches its climax, McClane also begins to exhibit signs of the superhero style powers of invincibility that made Live Free or Die Hard such a let-down. It's not enough to make me dislike the filmI still had a lot of fun with this onebut it is a worrying sign of things to come 7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.

    John McClane is back and better than ever. He is back in New York and currently on suspension. That is until Simon plays his game. Simon has McClane and Zeus Carver traipsing all over New York playing little games. McClane and Carver play along until McClane figures out that everything that Simon is putting them through is nothing but a wild goose chase. Simon turns out to be Simon Gruber, brother to Hans Gruber. Hans as you remember was killed by McClane in Calafornia several years before. Simon is bent on revenge... and gets pretty damn close. McClane does what he does best. He figures what Simon is really up to... the same thing that Hans was up to in California. Basically it's a heist, but the way everything is done is what makes the story so great. Bruce Willis brings his best to this role, as he has done twice before. I still maintain that if Willis had not been cast in this role there is not telling how successful the Die Hard franchise would have done. Bruce Willis IS John McClane. Jeremy Irons brings a different aspect to the story as Simon. The revenge angle has been done before but with the twist of the heist is a bit different. Samuel L. Jackson as Zeus Carver was a great move. Imagining someone else in any of these roles is unimaginable. The pace for this movie from beginning to end is fast, barely letting up for a breather. I give this 10 stars out of 10.

    "Die Hard with a Vengeance" is essentially the victim of overthinking. Different scripts were considered, and rejected for whatever reasons. In the end, they took a script by Jonathan Hensleigh (the very unfortunate screenwriter of Michael Bay trainwrecks like "The Rock" and "Armageddon") and tweaked it a little to make this movie. The first half goes okay enough. When the movie leaves Manhattan, it becomes a jumble of random action scenes. There is no real narrative consistency, it just meanders. I know they wanted to not make a "Die Hard on a Boat," etc. But, by going the opposite direction and having a dozen different locations, it just makes it seem like they patched it together as they went along. The performances are good, in general. Willis is always ready to go. But, Sam Jackson just does his angry black man routine, like he has in most of his movies. John McTiernan is a good director, but is one of those directors who shoots the script he's given. So, if it's a messed-up script, he shoots it without questioning it. After the movie goes on and on in its last hour, you want to just wrap it up. A major problem here is that they give McClane a sidekick, which he certainly doesn't need! I think that the producers and everyone else got freaked out by the fact that McClane talks to himself in the first two movies. So, they give him a sidekick. This has continued ever since. I think people just can't handle it if someone isn't psychologically right down the middle. So, if you have a guy talking to himself, people think "Can't have that!" Plus, gone is producer Joel Silver, who made the first two movies. This time, it's in the heavyhanded grasp of the producers who did "Rambo." So, there's gotta be a lot of blood and crazy-ass action, with little humor or sense of character. So it is with this movie, and the others that followed. The final action scene is good, but comes too late to make a difference. I know lots of people love this "Die Hard," but it does nothing for me, either then when I first saw it or now. In fact, when I saw it on opening day, I was in such shock that they actually made this the third "Die Hard" that I gave it a "B" on the CinemaScore card, when I actually would've given it an "F" if I were of sound mind at the time! * (1 Out of 10 Stars)

    A better film than Die Hard 2, though still not in the same league as the first one. This sees the city of New York as the battleground for John McClane, who finds himself targeted for revenge by a terrorist, and gaining help from Harlem storekeeper Zeus - Samuel L Jackson, who proves to be a terrific companion to John. The film gets off to a good start, with the pace rarely stopping to take a breath. At about the midway point, we see the true intentions of the main villain - a plot that smacks more than a bit of Goldfinger. When John realises the whole bomb plot by 'Simon' - Jeremy Irons - was actually to decoy police away from his intended target, it becomes a race against time to hunt him down. Where the film loses points a little is the somewhat weak finale, nowhere near as good as the climaxes for either the first two, though it should be noted the original intended ending was just plain bad. Until it stumbles at the end, another great ride for John McClane

    Once again, another Die Hard film is successful as this one does things a little differently then the other two but with a vengeance. I liked having Samuel Jackson in the film, teaming up with Willis as the two made a strong duo in maybe the craziest of then two films as this is filled with racial discrimination, riddles, and revenge. Jeremy Irons is very good as the new bad guy with a motive that did not have to be used but didn't ruin it for me anyway. The dialog was at its best in this film as it blurts out random things that are funny and corny. The characters are fine, the action and dialog are good and the setting is set downtown. I wish the wife was just killed off instead of moving again and these films are losing a little bit of its touch as it goes along, but I can never hate a Die Hard movie.

    Not much ado about how humor should be incorporated into it, DHWV is an absolute thriller and the most aspiring movie of the series till the fourth came into being. Bruce Willis impeccable, but in this, Jackson gives him a tough fight... man, what a performance by him, my mind was blown. Story is not pretty straightforward and the plot revolved around what I call is sweet, because the movie-watching experience doubles as things gel to John McClain as they do to you unless you are a smart-ass. Screenplay is pretty good and the music is better than DH2. BOTTOM LINE: This third movies in the beloved action series is a windy action flick, every DH fan should watch and follow! This one involved no love and lesser humor compared to the predecessors and talks solely about action, action & action. 9/10 Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES Language: Mediocre | Sex: Mild | Nudity: No | Foreplay & Mouth-Kiss: very Mild | Violence: Infinity raise to Infinity | Gore: Critical | Alcohol, Smoking or Drugs: No | Traumatizing Factor: Strong

    John McClaine once again returns as hard-edged cop after slightly worse Die Hard sequel, in another action-explosive filled pack adventure and reuniting with terrific John McTiernan (directed first 1988 film). This time setting is New York. McClaine is suspended, under divorce and drinking. Mysterious Simon has place several bombs throughout the city and needs for McClaine to co-operate, otherwise he'll blow another location (in opening sequence, he destroys department store). However, Simon holds another plan... and McClaine is only one who can stop him, with the help of black man Zeus Carver (Samuel L. Jackson). And all this sets the mood for frenetic chase through New York and ferocious action sequences. Yes, McTiernan is really fantastic action director. Plot is witty and never gets boring. Willis and Jackson are having great chemistry together, regardless this is not buddy cop movie. Soundtrack is simply memorable. Tasks (or riddles) that Simon provides for McClaine are always imaginative and do well for the overall plot. And, for the conclusion... My choice is still original feature, still remains as seminal action film. But this one is almost as the first one, Willis and Mctiernan are back and movie itself is an vast improvement over two recent entries, which I want to forget as soon as possible.

    Bruce Willis reprises his role as Detective Lieutenant John McClane in director John McTiernan's crime thriller "Die Hard with a Vengeance" with Samuel L. Jackson co-starring as a racist African-American. McClane is back with the New York Police Department, but he has been on suspension. McClane teams up with Zeus Carver to battle with a master criminal who has orchestrated the caper of a life-time. These two opposites meet in Harlem when McClane is dispatched across 110th Street and forced to wear a set of wooden sandwich boards with the N-word written on it. What we don't learn until later on is the villainous Simon Peter Gruber is related to Hans Gruber in "Die Hard," and he is exacting revenge while he steals the Federal Reserve Bank Depository blind. Simon Gruber (Jeremy Irons of "Damage") keeps our heroes trotting along over New York City on his random errands. Zeus finds himself stuck with McClane and Samuel L. Jackson enlivens things considerably with his hot-headed character. There are more than enough thrills to keep our attention.

    This movie is exciting, fast and thrilling; it rides hard on the action leaving little room for story depth just straight forward action with unbelievable acting by the leads and the movie did not have any of the other main cast from the first two movies, regardless this movie is just a wonderful action movie that we all should get the thrill of seeing. This is one wonderful Die Hard addition, as our hero is paired with another great actor Samuel L.

    This movie doesn't get enough love if you ask me. Die Hard With a Vengeance is a pulse pounding, explosive and smart action movie that actually almost comes close to trumping the original Die Hard if you ask me. In this movie, Simon Gruber (Jeremy Irons), brother of Hans Gruber, is out for revenge on John McClane, now in his hometown of New York City, for killing his brother at the Nakatomi Plaza that Christmas Eve of 1988, while attempting to steal the gold from the Federal Reserve's gold vault. Paired up with a pawn shop owner named Zeus (Samuel L Jackson) it's up to them to solve Simon's cryptic phone calls by playing a game of "Simon Says." This movie somewhat deviates away from the original's idea of one man trapped in a location, which I actually really like seeing as though some originality is needed in a sequel or it'll just be considered a rehash. Add in terrific chemistry between Willis and Jackson, who really should be in more movies together, along with explosive action and a great villain, Die Hard 3 is a near perfect follow up to the original and in my opinion the best sequel in the franchise. 9.5/10

    Die Hard director John McTiernan returns for this second sequel to his 1988 action classic, which sees Bruce Willis once again playing tough NY cop John McClane, this time being sent on a wild-goose chase around the Big Apple in the company of Harlem 'good Samaritan' Zeus Carver (Samuel L. Jackson) while evil Euro-villain Simon Gruber (Jeremy Irons) breaks into the city's Federal Gold Reserve. Full of the incredible explosive set-pieces that one has come to expect of the series, Die Hard: With a Vengeance certainly delivers in terms of sheer spectacle, but with Jackson's Carver in tow, one-time 'lone cowboy' McClane has now become one half of a comedy act, the film working more like an 80s buddy movie as a result. As the film reaches its climax, McClane also begins to exhibit signs of the superhero style powers of invincibility that made Live Free or Die Hard such a let-down. It's not enough to make me dislike the filmI still had a lot of fun with this onebut it is a worrying sign of things to come 7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.

    John McClane is back and better than ever. He is back in New York and currently on suspension. That is until Simon plays his game. Simon has McClane and Zeus Carver traipsing all over New York playing little games. McClane and Carver play along until McClane figures out that everything that Simon is putting them through is nothing but a wild goose chase. Simon turns out to be Simon Gruber, brother to Hans Gruber. Hans as you remember was killed by McClane in Calafornia several years before. Simon is bent on revenge... and gets pretty damn close. McClane does what he does best. He figures what Simon is really up to... the same thing that Hans was up to in California. Basically it's a heist, but the way everything is done is what makes the story so great. Bruce Willis brings his best to this role, as he has done twice before. I still maintain that if Willis had not been cast in this role there is not telling how successful the Die Hard franchise would have done. Bruce Willis IS John McClane. Jeremy Irons brings a different aspect to the story as Simon. The revenge angle has been done before but with the twist of the heist is a bit different. Samuel L. Jackson as Zeus Carver was a great move. Imagining someone else in any of these roles is unimaginable. The pace for this movie from beginning to end is fast, barely letting up for a breather. I give this 10 stars out of 10.

    "Die Hard with a Vengeance" is essentially the victim of overthinking. Different scripts were considered, and rejected for whatever reasons. In the end, they took a script by Jonathan Hensleigh (the very unfortunate screenwriter of Michael Bay trainwrecks like "The Rock" and "Armageddon") and tweaked it a little to make this movie. The first half goes okay enough. When the movie leaves Manhattan, it becomes a jumble of random action scenes. There is no real narrative consistency, it just meanders. I know they wanted to not make a "Die Hard on a Boat," etc. But, by going the opposite direction and having a dozen different locations, it just makes it seem like they patched it together as they went along. The performances are good, in general. Willis is always ready to go. But, Sam Jackson just does his angry black man routine, like he has in most of his movies. John McTiernan is a good director, but is one of those directors who shoots the script he's given. So, if it's a messed-up script, he shoots it without questioning it. After the movie goes on and on in its last hour, you want to just wrap it up. A major problem here is that they give McClane a sidekick, which he certainly doesn't need! I think that the producers and everyone else got freaked out by the fact that McClane talks to himself in the first two movies. So, they give him a sidekick. This has continued ever since. I think people just can't handle it if someone isn't psychologically right down the middle. So, if you have a guy talking to himself, people think "Can't have that!" Plus, gone is producer Joel Silver, who made the first two movies. This time, it's in the heavyhanded grasp of the producers who did "Rambo." So, there's gotta be a lot of blood and crazy-ass action, with little humor or sense of character. So it is with this movie, and the others that followed. The final action scene is good, but comes too late to make a difference. I know lots of people love this "Die Hard," but it does nothing for me, either then when I first saw it or now. In fact, when I saw it on opening day, I was in such shock that they actually made this the third "Die Hard" that I gave it a "B" on the CinemaScore card, when I actually would've given it an "F" if I were of sound mind at the time! * (1 Out of 10 Stars)

    A better film than Die Hard 2, though still not in the same league as the first one. This sees the city of New York as the battleground for John McClane, who finds himself targeted for revenge by a terrorist, and gaining help from Harlem storekeeper Zeus - Samuel L Jackson, who proves to be a terrific companion to John. The film gets off to a good start, with the pace rarely stopping to take a breath. At about the midway point, we see the true intentions of the main villain - a plot that smacks more than a bit of Goldfinger. When John realises the whole bomb plot by 'Simon' - Jeremy Irons - was actually to decoy police away from his intended target, it becomes a race against time to hunt him down. Where the film loses points a little is the somewhat weak finale, nowhere near as good as the climaxes for either the first two, though it should be noted the original intended ending was just plain bad. Until it stumbles at the end, another great ride for John McClane

    Once again, another Die Hard film is successful as this one does things a little differently then the other two but with a vengeance. I liked having Samuel Jackson in the film, teaming up with Willis as the two made a strong duo in maybe the craziest of then two films as this is filled with racial discrimination, riddles, and revenge. Jeremy Irons is very good as the new bad guy with a motive that did not have to be used but didn't ruin it for me anyway. The dialog was at its best in this film as it blurts out random things that are funny and corny. The characters are fine, the action and dialog are good and the setting is set downtown. I wish the wife was just killed off instead of moving again and these films are losing a little bit of its touch as it goes along, but I can never hate a Die Hard movie.

    Not much ado about how humor should be incorporated into it, DHWV is an absolute thriller and the most aspiring movie of the series till the fourth came into being. Bruce Willis impeccable, but in this, Jackson gives him a tough fight... man, what a performance by him, my mind was blown. Story is not pretty straightforward and the plot revolved around what I call is sweet, because the movie-watching experience doubles as things gel to John McClain as they do to you unless you are a smart-ass. Screenplay is pretty good and the music is better than DH2. BOTTOM LINE: This third movies in the beloved action series is a windy action flick, every DH fan should watch and follow! This one involved no love and lesser humor compared to the predecessors and talks solely about action, action & action. 9/10 Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES Language: Mediocre | Sex: Mild | Nudity: No | Foreplay & Mouth-Kiss: very Mild | Violence: Infinity raise to Infinity | Gore: Critical | Alcohol, Smoking or Drugs: No | Traumatizing Factor: Strong

    John McClaine once again returns as hard-edged cop after slightly worse Die Hard sequel, in another action-explosive filled pack adventure and reuniting with terrific John McTiernan (directed first 1988 film). This time setting is New York. McClaine is suspended, under divorce and drinking. Mysterious Simon has place several bombs throughout the city and needs for McClaine to co-operate, otherwise he'll blow another location (in opening sequence, he destroys department store). However, Simon holds another plan... and McClaine is only one who can stop him, with the help of black man Zeus Carver (Samuel L. Jackson). And all this sets the mood for frenetic chase through New York and ferocious action sequences. Yes, McTiernan is really fantastic action director. Plot is witty and never gets boring. Willis and Jackson are having great chemistry together, regardless this is not buddy cop movie. Soundtrack is simply memorable. Tasks (or riddles) that Simon provides for McClaine are always imaginative and do well for the overall plot. And, for the conclusion... My choice is still original feature, still remains as seminal action film. But this one is almost as the first one, Willis and Mctiernan are back and movie itself is an vast improvement over two recent entries, which I want to forget as soon as possible.

    Bruce Willis reprises his role as Detective Lieutenant John McClane in director John McTiernan's crime thriller "Die Hard with a Vengeance" with Samuel L. Jackson co-starring as a racist African-American. McClane is back with the New York Police Department, but he has been on suspension. McClane teams up with Zeus Carver to battle with a master criminal who has orchestrated the caper of a life-time. These two opposites meet in Harlem when McClane is dispatched across 110th Street and forced to wear a set of wooden sandwich boards with the N-word written on it. What we don't learn until later on is the villainous Simon Peter Gruber is related to Hans Gruber in "Die Hard," and he is exacting revenge while he steals the Federal Reserve Bank Depository blind. Simon Gruber (Jeremy Irons of "Damage") keeps our heroes trotting along over New York City on his random errands. Zeus finds himself stuck with McClane and Samuel L. Jackson enlivens things considerably with his hot-headed character. There are more than enough thrills to keep our attention.

    This movie is exciting, fast and thrilling; it rides hard on the action leaving little room for story depth just straight forward action with unbelievable acting by the leads and the movie did not have any of the other main cast from the first two movies, regardless this movie is just a wonderful action movie that we all should get the thrill of seeing. This is one wonderful Die Hard addition, as our hero is paired with another great actor Samuel L. Jackson as McClane goes up against a vengeful terrorist, who is here for one reason payback as McClane took down his brother in the first Die Hard movie but payback was just part of the check list also making out with over 140 billion in gold from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was also part of that list. The movie starts with a big explosion, and unlike the first two McClane was in full control of what was going on, a twist from the previous 2 films and a welcome twist if I can say so myself. The second Die Hard movie (Die Hard 2: Die Harder) ended with McClane and Holly walking off happy, this starts with McClane all washed up from a split from his wife. I love this movie, and Simon says, "Everyone should go see this" because to me this movie was better than the second in the franchise. www.lagsreviews.com

This movie somewhat deviates away from the original's idea of one man trapped in a location, which I actually really like seeing as though some originality is needed in a sequel or it'll just be considered a rehash. Add in terrific chemistry between Willis and Jackson, who really should be in more movies together, along with explosive action and a great villain, Die Hard 3 is a near perfect follow up to the original and in my opinion the best sequel in the franchise. 9.5/10

    Die Hard director John McTiernan returns for this second sequel to his 1988 action classic, which sees Bruce Willis once again playing tough NY cop John McClane, this time being sent on a wild-goose chase around the Big Apple in the company of Harlem 'good Samaritan' Zeus Carver (Samuel L. Jackson) while evil Euro-villain Simon Gruber (Jeremy Irons) breaks into the city's Federal Gold Reserve. Full of the incredible explosive set-pieces that one has come to expect of the series, Die Hard: With a Vengeance certainly delivers in terms of sheer spectacle, but with Jackson's Carver in tow, one-time 'lone cowboy' McClane has now become one half of a comedy act, the film working more like an 80s buddy movie as a result. As the film reaches its climax, McClane also begins to exhibit signs of the superhero style powers of invincibility that made Live Free or Die Hard such a let-down. It's not enough to make me dislike the filmI still had a lot of fun with this onebut it is a worrying sign of things to come 7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.

    John McClane is back and better than ever. He is back in New York and currently on suspension. That is until Simon plays his game. Simon has McClane and Zeus Carver traipsing all over New York playing little games. McClane and Carver play along until McClane figures out that everything that Simon is putting them through is nothing but a wild goose chase. Simon turns out to be Simon Gruber, brother to Hans Gruber. Hans as you remember was killed by McClane in Calafornia several years before. Simon is bent on revenge... and gets pretty damn close. McClane does what he does best. He figures what Simon is really up to... the same thing that Hans was up to in California. Basically it's a heist, but the way everything is done is what makes the story so great. Bruce Willis brings his best to this role, as he has done twice before. I still maintain that if Willis had not been cast in this role there is not telling how successful the Die Hard franchise would have done. Bruce Willis IS John McClane. Jeremy Irons brings a different aspect to the story as Simon. The revenge angle has been done before but with the twist of the heist is a bit different. Samuel L. Jackson as Zeus Carver was a great move. Imagining someone else in any of these roles is unimaginable. The pace for this movie from beginning to end is fast, barely letting up for a breather. I give this 10 stars out of 10.

    "Die Hard with a Vengeance" is essentially the victim of overthinking. Different scripts were considered, and rejected for whatever reasons. In the end, they took a script by Jonathan Hensleigh (the very unfortunate screenwriter of Michael Bay trainwrecks like "The Rock" and "Armageddon") and tweaked it a little to make this movie. The first half goes okay enough. When the movie leaves Manhattan, it becomes a jumble of random action scenes. There is no real narrative consistency, it just meanders. I know they wanted to not make a "Die Hard on a Boat," etc. But, by going the opposite direction and having a dozen different locations, it just makes it seem like they patched it together as they went along. The performances are good, in general. Willis is always ready to go. But, Sam Jackson just does his angry black man routine, like he has in most of his movies. John McTiernan is a good director, but is one of those directors who shoots the script he's given. So, if it's a messed-up script, he shoots it without questioning it. After the movie goes on and on in its last hour, you want to just wrap it up. A major problem here is that they give McClane a sidekick, which he certainly doesn't need! I think that the producers and everyone else got freaked out by the fact that McClane talks to himself in the first two movies. So, they give him a sidekick. This has continued ever since. I think people just can't handle it if someone isn't psychologically right down the middle. So, if you have a guy talking to himself, people think "Can't have that!" Plus, gone is producer Joel Silver, who made the first two movies. This time, it's in the heavyhanded grasp of the producers who did "Rambo." So, there's gotta be a lot of blood and crazy-ass action, with little humor or sense of character. So it is with this movie, and the others that followed. The final action scene is good, but comes too late to make a difference. I know lots of people love this "Die Hard," but it does nothing for me, either then when I first saw it or now. In fact, when I saw it on opening day, I was in such shock that they actually made this the third "Die Hard" that I gave it a "B" on the CinemaScore card, when I actually would've given it an "F" if I were of sound mind at the time! * (1 Out of 10 Stars)

    A better film than Die Hard 2, though still not in the same league as the first one. This sees the city of New York as the battleground for John McClane, who finds himself targeted for revenge by a terrorist, and gaining help from Harlem storekeeper Zeus - Samuel L Jackson, who proves to be a terrific companion to John. The film gets off to a good start, with the pace rarely stopping to take a breath. At about the midway point, we see the true intentions of the main villain - a plot that smacks more than a bit of Goldfinger. When John realises the whole bomb plot by 'Simon' - Jeremy Irons - was actually to decoy police away from his intended target, it becomes a race against time to hunt him down. Where the film loses points a little is the somewhat weak finale, nowhere near as good as the climaxes for either the first two, though it should be noted the original intended ending was just plain bad. Until it stumbles at the end, another great ride for John McClane

    Once again, another Die Hard film is successful as this one does things a little differently then the other two but with a vengeance. I liked having Samuel Jackson in the film, teaming up with Willis as the two made a strong duo in maybe the craziest of then two films as this is filled with racial discrimination, riddles, and revenge. Jeremy Irons is very good as the new bad guy with a motive that did not have to be used but didn't ruin it for me anyway. The dialog was at its best in this film as it blurts out random things that are funny and corny. The characters are fine, the action and dialog are good and the setting is set downtown. I wish the wife was just killed off instead of moving again and these films are losing a little bit of its touch as it goes along, but I can never hate a Die Hard movie.

    Not much ado about how humor should be incorporated into it, DHWV is an absolute thriller and the most aspiring movie of the series till the fourth came into being. Bruce Willis impeccable, but in this, Jackson gives him a tough fight... man, what a performance by him, my mind was blown. Story is not pretty straightforward and the plot revolved around what I call is sweet, because the movie-watching experience doubles as things gel to John McClain as they do to you unless you are a smart-ass. Screenplay is pretty good and the music is better than DH2. BOTTOM LINE: This third movies in the beloved action series is a windy action flick, every DH fan should watch and follow! This one involved no love and lesser humor compared to the predecessors and talks solely about action, action & action. 9/10 Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES Language: Mediocre | Sex: Mild | Nudity: No | Foreplay & Mouth-Kiss: very Mild | Violence: Infinity raise to Infinity | Gore: Critical | Alcohol, Smoking or Drugs: No | Traumatizing Factor: Strong

    John McClaine once again returns as hard-edged cop after slightly worse Die Hard sequel, in another action-explosive filled pack adventure and reuniting with terrific John McTiernan (directed first 1988 film). This time setting is New York. McClaine is suspended, under divorce and drinking. Mysterious Simon has place several bombs throughout the city and needs for McClaine to co-operate, otherwise he'll blow another location (in opening sequence, he destroys department store). However, Simon holds another plan... and McClaine is only one who can stop him, with the help of black man Zeus Carver (Samuel L. Jackson). And all this sets the mood for frenetic chase through New York and ferocious action sequences. Yes, McTiernan is really fantastic action director. Plot is witty and never gets boring. Willis and Jackson are having great chemistry together, regardless this is not buddy cop movie. Soundtrack is simply memorable. Tasks (or riddles) that Simon provides for McClaine are always imaginative and do well for the overall plot. And, for the conclusion... My choice is still original feature, still remains as seminal action film. But this one is almost as the first one, Willis and Mctiernan are back and movie itself is an vast improvement over two recent entries, which I want to forget as soon as possible.

    Bruce Willis reprises his role as Detective Lieutenant John McClane in director John McTiernan's crime thriller "Die Hard with a Vengeance" with Samuel L. Jackson co-starring as a racist African-American. McClane is back with the New York Police Department, but he has been on suspension. McClane teams up with Zeus Carver to battle with a master criminal who has orchestrated the caper of a life-time. These two opposites meet in Harlem when McClane is dispatched across 110th Street and forced to wear a set of wooden sandwich boards with the N-word written on it. What we don't learn until later on is the villainous Simon Peter Gruber is related to Hans Gruber in "Die Hard," and he is exacting revenge while he steals the Federal Reserve Bank Depository blind. Simon Gruber (Jeremy Irons of "Damage") keeps our heroes trotting along over New York City on his random errands. Zeus finds himself stuck with McClane and Samuel L. Jackson enlivens things considerably with his hot-headed character. There are more than enough thrills to keep our attention.

    This movie is exciting, fast and thrilling; it rides hard on the action leaving little room for story depth just straight forward action with unbelievable acting by the leads and the movie did not have any of the other main cast from the first two movies, regardless this movie is just a wonderful action movie that we all should get the thrill of seeing. This is one wonderful Die Hard addition, as our hero is paired with another great actor Samuel L. Jackson as McClane goes up against a vengeful terrorist, who is here for one reason payback as McClane took down his brother in the first Die Hard movie but payback was just part of the check list also making out with over 140 billion in gold from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was also part of that list. The movie starts with a big explosion, and unlike the first two McClane was in full control of what was going on, a twist from the previous 2 films and a welcome twist if I can say so myself. The second Die Hard movie (Die Hard 2: Die Harder) ended with McClane and Holly walking off happy, this starts with McClane all washed up from a split from his wife. I love this movie, and Simon says, "Everyone should go see this" because to me this movie was better than the second in the franchise. www.lagsreviews.com

    This movie doesn't get enough love if you ask me. Die Hard With a Vengeance is a pulse pounding, explosive and smart action movie that actually almost comes close to trumping the original Die Hard if you ask me. In this movie, Simon Gruber (Jeremy Irons), brother of Hans Gruber, is out for revenge on John McClane, now in his hometown of New York City, for killing his brother at the Nakatomi Plaza that Christmas Eve of 1988, while attempting to steal the gold from the Federal Reserve's gold vault.
