 <sinopse>
  In 1950's Los Angeles, a special crime squad of the LAPD investigates the murder of a young woman.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  This film is about the adventures of a 1940's special anti-gangster police squad in Los Angeles, the infamous 'Hat Squad.' The four members of this squad are big, tough, no-nonsense cops who don't hesitate to break the law, if it suits their purposes. When a local woman is murdered, their investigation turns up the fact that she had been romantically linked to several prominent men and had secret films taken of her liaisons. Since one of those men is the powerful U.S. Army General at the head of the then-new Atomic Energy Commission and another is the (married) leader of the Hat Squad, complications ensue. The FBI even gets involved in an attempted cover-up.

    Mulholland Falls is directed by Lee Tamahori and written by Pete Dexter. It stars Nick Nolte, Chazz Palminteri, Melanie Griffith, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, Jennifer Connelly, Treat Williams, John Malkovich, Bruce Dern and Andrew McCarthy. Music is by Dave Grusin and cinematography by Haskell Wexler. 1950s Los Angeles and four unorthodox detectives led by Maxwell Hoover (Nolte) are called in to investigate the death of a young woman found crushed at a construction site. The woman is revealed to be an aspiring actress who had recently had a relationship with the married Hoover. Can is open, and worms everywhere, and following those worms leads Hoover down murky avenues... It's the almost nearly great neo-noir movie, everything looks right in principal, it has a strongly assembled cast, the 50s visuals and cinematography are splendid, and the murder mystery element of the plot - with some added sex, sizzle and nuclear shenanigans - looks promising on the page. Yet it never delivers on that promise of being something dark, to be a labyrinthine noir thriller beating a black heart. It starts of so well, based on the infamous "Hat Squad" we reasonably expect the story to expand upon the opening macho machinations of the four tough hombres in the hats, but instead away from Nolte's grizzled Hoover, the other three guys are merely dressed up props. Which means there's some good actors wasted, sadly. As the plot moves slowly forward the investigation and Hoover character axis becomes less interesting. Griffith came in for some critical grief for a lacklustre performance, but she's done no favours by the writers who fail to give her marriage to Hoover any substance. So when things go pear shaped and the characters of Mr and Mrs Hoover should explode on the screen, we really don't care having had no interest previously to hang our emotional being on. It all builds to what can best be described as a poor pay off, the resolution to the hinted at muddy mystery is hardly shocking, and the "big" face-off sequence between good and bad guys (or bad and bad if you prefer) is about as exciting as watching paint dry. It's not an awful movie, but it is a very disappointing one. A film where a bit more thought given by the producers could have yielded so much more. 5/10

    I've found that if I somehow leave the room for food or a break, the film probably isn't really very good. Good or better keep me glued. I never left my seat during Mulholland Falls and from the opening sequences with the four LA cops in hats riding up sunny 1950's Hollywood Hills in a big black convertible, I was hooked. Hooked especially by a galvanizing, snappy performance by Nick Nolte as Hoover, head of his squad of four, a man of action before words, a man who simmers and glares and loves with passion: it's a performance that somehow should have been given more attention at the time of the film's release, a cops and crime film which somehow didn't match the zeitgeist of its period, lost in the shuffle. Almost every noir mystery past 1949 is a retread of some sort (Chinatown being a major exception),but what makes Mulholland Falls work is not the plot but the heady collection of dedicated supporting actors whether Melanie Griffith as a quietly restrained wife of a cop, or Chazz Palminteri, the wry right hand partner who talks about his psychiatrist without hesitation. The mystery deals with corruption in high places, of course, and John Malkovich and Treat Williams are good supports for Nolte to play against--but it's Nolte's show from start to finish and his intensity nails it!

    Wanna be L.A. Confidential was surprisingly released the year before but everything that that film got right this one gets wrong. The sets and costumes are pristine, not a single crease or smudge, that's the problem with them, everything looks new-not lived in. The actors some like Nolte and Madsen who would seem to be ideal for the period are as at sea as the miscast actors like Andrew McCarthy, who gives a fussy unconvincing turn, all are stiff and give no sense of actually living in the time period, everything feels very staged. The main fault lies with the director who doesn't seem to have a real feeling for the material and just wants to create pretty pictures. Adequate but nothing more.

    This film looks fantastic and is chock-full of great actors(Nick Nolte, Melanie Griffith, Chris Penn, Bruce Dern, John Malkovich, Chazz Palminteri, and more). A low-brow Chinatown. The 'look' of this film, and Nick Nolte's performance are the only things that are even close to the level of that earlier, finer work. However, this is well worth a view - especially if you are looking for a throwback escape from all the new release trash that's out there today. Sidenote: Jennifer Connelly's breasts should be the standard of perfection. Some of the fine actors have to take a backseat because there are just so many involved here. Nolte, however, is the star of this show, and his performance is definitely noteworthy. It's Nick's performance, and Tomahori's attention to graphic detail that make this film above average. The plot is an atomic bomb. You'll like this if you liked: Black Dahlia, L.A. Confidential(note: this movie is nowhere near that level), Miller's Crossing and Basic Instinct. 64/100

    When I watched this film recently I thought that it must have been made by people trying to capitalize on the success of L.A. Confidential. It has the same look and it has nothing short of a phenomenal cast list. But it actually came out a year before L.A. Confidential. I suspect that the L.A. Confidential producers wee quaking in their boots after this attempted film noir bombed at the box office. But of course, L.A. Confidential turned out to be a great success and is remembered as one of the truly great modern film noirs, combining all of the best features of a great film, and getting that 40's and 50's feeling just right. About all the Mulholland Falls gets right is the 40's and 50's feeling. But the cast of the Hat Squad come off as almost comic book figures. They drive around town in a big convertible but their hats never even flicker, less blow off in the breeze, even when they are trying to outrace an Army jeep at a nuclear test site. Indoors, they take off their coats but never their hats. The pace of the movie is glacially slow. It's difficult to stay awake. The writing is sub-par and all too predictable. The two talented and beautiful women in the movie, Melanie Griffith and Jennifer Connelly are largely wasted with relatively little screen time. In one comical scene Connelly is slapped by her mobster boyfriend and barely flinches. She returns the slap and almost knocks the guy over. Aren't mobsters supposed to be able to hit better than that? Or at least take a slap from a girl? Parts of the plot are beyond ridiculous. At the nuclear test site, the Hat Squad takes off down a road marked restricted, shoots the padlock off a locked gate, and then acts surprised when the Army comes after them. And John Malkovich as an effete and intellectual Army general in a red smoking jacket is so out of place to be absurd. Continuity is also a shambles in this film. During the airplane fight, Treat Williams has one of the rip cords from a parachute tied around his neck as he is thrown to the floor of the plane in front of the door. The next shot is a close-up of him sitting on the floor and the cord is mysteriously gone. At the end of the film, the three surviving members of the Hat Squad place their hats on the coffin of their fallen comrade. Nick Nolte then proceeds to put on his hat (not the one on the coffin) as they walk away. Where did that hat come from? The film has its moments but its poor writing and incredibly slow pace waste a great cast that tries as best they can to overcome the deficiencies of a crummy plot.

    With all the names in this film you'd think it would be "can't miss" material. The setting, in some respect, is challenging: MF is going to be compared to CHINATOWN and LA CONFIDENTIAL. Those two classics have nothing to fear. What MF offers is nothing more than ridiculous. The introductory scene has our fabulous four murdering a supposed mobster, though the only evil we know of the victim is sarcasm. Bad move. We are soon instructed to love the characters as altruistic. A significant portion of the film is the fab four riding around in their car wherein we're supposed to be entertained by unfunny and distracting banter. The plot is relatively simple and just gets dumber and dumberer. The casting of Nick Nolte is a mistake: We need a less intimidating character. Melanie Griffen and Andrew McCarthy give great performances that are wasted. John Malkovich and Treat Williams go through the motions. The sets and costumes are great, but the film's actual stars are Jennifer Connelly's breasts, variously covered and uncovered. What a waste of time and money.

    A top drawer cast stars in "Mulholland Falls," a 1996 film starring Nick Nolte, Chazz Palmentieri, Melanie Griffith, Jennifer Connelly, Michael Madsen, Treat Williams, Bruce Dern, and John Malkovich, directed by New Zealand director Lee Tamahori. Sometimes when I don't know the year of a film, I try to guess. I placed this film in 1998 because I concluded it must have come after "L.A. Confidential" since it's about '50s crime investigation. Also, Jennifer Connelly is very young here - reminiscent of the way she looked in "Dark City." I was two years off. The story concerns the L.A. Hat Squad, led by Max Hoover (Nolte) called to investigate the brutal murder of Allison Pond (Jennifer Connelly). When her body is turned over, Hoover realizes it's an ex-girlfriend. He's never told his wife (Melanie Griffith) about the affair, stating that he had the affair, it ended, no one got hurt, and to tell her would hurt her deeply. The investigation of the murder leads to a general (John Malkovich), an atom bomb testing site, secret film footage, and military secrets. Very good performances from everyone - had Nolte been able to keep his life together, he could have been up there with the very greatest. He's always been capable of truly great performances, all the way back to the "Rich Man, Poor Man" days. Here one can feel his tremendous sadness and weariness. It's a pall that hangs over the entire film. Jennifer Connelly, whose part isn't very large, is gorgeous, sexy, and tough. Melanie Griffith gives a mature performance as Hoover's wife. Uncredited in the film are Rob Lowe and Louise Fletcher. There is a very exciting scene at the end of the movie. "Mulholland Falls" never received the attention that "L.A. Confidential" did. One can blame marketing, but the story isn't special enough, the characters not as well delineated, and the pace is a bit too leisurely. This isn't to say it's not a good film. It's just not exceptional. I applaud anyone who does a period noir that comes off like a noir and not a bad attempt. There, "Mullholland Falls" succeeds admirably.

    I quite like films like Mulholland Falls; films about shady, down-beat and supposedly emotionless American detectives searching for something dear as they do their best to hide the fact that it means that much to them. Films that are daft enough but enjoyable enough to have their leads be able to spot vital clues linked to the overall success of their goal whilst being in a state of near intoxication by way of hard alcohol. Nick Nolte's character does this towards the end of Mulholland Falls when watching a short, silent piece of moving image footage, but there you go. The film itself is a dank and involving noir inspired thriller from 1996 about corruption and murder amidst the higher-ups of the nation and one man's quest to uncover it; only, he doesn't know it at the time. The beauty of these stories is that they establish a hard-as-nails male lead whom keeps within his little pool of dishing out pain and retribution, effectively, before broadening them out into a wider scope of scum and dispute; the catch being that the negative characteristics on these outside of the pool are tougher to spot: they're still there, but they hide amidst this sea of expensive furniture, clothing and generally plush mise-en-scene. The film begins with two 8MM pieces of film footage that we feel we have no right to observe: some blast footage of an atomic weapon being tested and therefore detonated, exemplified when we sporadically cut to another film and an army official pushing the camera operator, ie; the audience, away from the general area; as well as another film in which a mounted camera is pointing at two people about to engage in sexual activity. Such is the tone the film will take, and such is the battle the lead has on him that in order to succeed in his mission, he'll need to break on through and confront things that certain others would rather you wouldn't see or realise were there. Corruption is a rife and pleasurable theme for classical film noir, or more contemporary noirs that pay homage; corruption usually equating to cheating, lying or deception and when the general ingredients are on the money; the piece ends up worth seeing. The film would have you think it's about four guys, police officers in 1950s Los Angeles, taking names and kicking their way around town, bullying those they deem guilty of whatever crime by tossing them down a hill just off Mulholland Drive. At least it might've been about that had it been set several years prior to events here. Here, Nolte's cop named Max Hoover gets in way over his head and finds himself on a road to all things dangerous when he and his crew come across a woman firmly embedded within the ground out in the open wilderness nearby a construction site. It looks like she's hit the ground from a great height, but everyone's puzzled as to how it might have happened. Further more, Hoover knows the girl from recent times. Hoover has a wife he struggles to truly connect with over the course of the film, she's young; attractive and enjoys reading Hemingway, but like most films about butch men working together for the greater-good; Mulholland Falls is more interested in a relationship between two males, that of Hoover and Chazz Palminteri's cop Elleroy Coolidge, a guy in that group of four which also consisted of Michael Madsen and Chris Penn  but loosing both of them would do the film no harm. The death of the young girl, a certain Allison Pond (Connelly), affects Hoover in ways that doesn't see him afraid to admit to, purely because he once upon a time had an affair with her, rendering the investigation somewhat personal rather than just strictly business. What do we come to learn of Palminteri's character? Well, we learn that it's not wise to back chat him just prior to taking a drink out of a glass full of something, but we also come to find of the issues he carries; someone whom it is revealed suffers from personal problems of his own and much to some of the other hard-nosed archetype cop's confusion; his issues and the exploration of them somewhat going against what it is that makes these archetypes in these sorts of films so recognisable. Coolidge's thoughts on the Western film genre, for one, is supposed to signify a broader sense of thinking away from all the hard-nosed work while his linking this to thoughts on the ramifications certain events have on future items display a meek sense of sensory awareness. It is no coincidence then that the two find a degree of solace with one another and it ought not be much of a surprise to see Coolidge connect with Hoover in the way they do; one coming to the other's aid and sharing the burden of the film's denouement together. The film eventually branches out into a feud between those within the world of the 'just', a sort of documentation of the birth of internal affairs, only not making out that that's what it is particularly evident; instead delivering dramatically rather than historically a tight enough narrative to do with corruption and 'the enemy within' linked to the F.B.I. and The U.S. Army. Yes, there are sequences that feel patched on; yes, we know exactly who'll survive and who won't survive certain gunfights half way through and yes, it really could do without two of its four leads of whom the film barely makes any attempt to really get the most out of the performers in question, but Mulholland Falls is a knowing if somewhat flimsy tale of a man's life coming apart as he confronts past mistakes and current ones on the state's behalf.

    This movie needed more Jennifer Connelly, and it needed to be in black and white. I'm sorry, but noir never really works for me unless it's steeped in shadows and a colorless world. That's just what I've been conditioned to expect from a good noir movie. If Mulholland Falls would have been set in the modern day, I think that the color wouldn't have bothered me as much, but the combination of the time period and the style makes the colorization just to much for me to tolerate. As for Jennifer, she's the crux of the film, but we don't get to spend very much time at all with her. We don't get a sense of who she is and why she did the things that she did, and that greatly lessens the impact of her death. If you don't care about the core of the story, then it's difficult to have any real investment in the rest of the movie. In all honesty, even if the movie was in black and white and Jennifer Connelly had two times more scenes, this movie would probably still be boring. I just never cared or was interested in what was going on. Michael Madsen was wasted, there wasn't nearly enough of John Malkovich, and Nick Nolte was just smacking people and looking grim. Mulholland Falls gets two stars for Jennifer Connelly's magnificence, but even her wonders barely made it worth watching.

    "Mulholland Falls" is a murder mystery which, at the time of its release, failed to achieve a very positive response from either the critics or the public. This is unfortunate because it does have a number of qualities which make it both entertaining and praiseworthy and its evocation of the period in which it's set (the early 1950s) is both visually impressive and atmospheric. Director Lee Tamahori and cinematographer Haskell Wexler deserve credit for this as does Dave Grusin who was responsible for the marvellous original score. In typical film noir style, the main protagonist (in this case a police detective) finds himself in a situation in which he's out of his depth and then finds that further developments just continue to make things worse as he follows a route which seems destined to take him into a state of being both morally and emotionally impoverished. Max Hoover (Nick Nolte) is the leader of a squad of four LAPD detectives whose job is to get rid of gangsters and criminals and they do this very effectively. Their modus operandi is to dispense justice in a very brutal and unorthodox manner and they're able to do this with impunity because they have the support of their Chief of Police (Bruce Dern). When a woman's dead body is found at a construction site and the squad investigate, it soon emerges that she was Allison Pond (Jennifer Connelly). Pond was an aspiring actress and Hoover is shaken by what he finds because he'd previously had a six month affair with her before deciding to end the relationship. Shortly after, a film is discovered which shows Pond having sex with a man who turns out to be General Thomas Timms (John Malkovich). Timms is the head of the Atomic Energy Commission and when the squad continue their investigation they soon come up against hostility and threats from Colonel Fitzgerald (Treat Williams) and FBI Agent McCafferty (Daniel Baldwin) before discovering the existence of a conspiracy to conceal the activities of personnel at a military base where atomic bomb tests had been carried out. The anguish that Hoover experiences during this case is worsened when a film showing one of his encounters with Allison Pond comes into the possession of his wife Katherine (Melanie Griffith). Although he'd eventually finished his affair with Pond because he'd cared more for his wife, the pain of discovering his infidelity is no less intense for Katherine who is totally heartbroken. The reason why Pond was murdered is gradually revealed and Hoover and his partner Ellery Coolidge (Chazz Palminteri) have to engage in a frantic fight for their lives before the story comes to its sombre conclusion. Hoover's squad, which also comprises Coolidge, Eddie Hall (Michael Madsen) and Arthur Relyea (Chris Penn) is great fun to watch as its members swagger around in stylish suits or cruise around in a Buick convertible. The picture of the four of them standing on the edge of a bomb crater is also particularly striking. The closest relationship within the squad is between Hoover and Coolidge and in a significant departure from the otherwise macho ethos of the group, Coolidge is not only undergoing a course of counselling to deal with his temper and food issues but has also completely bought into the benefits of psychotherapy. When Hoover is worried about Katherine finding out about his affair, Coolidge suggests talking the matter through to reach a solution. This suggestion doesn't sit well with Hoover who sees it as an abdication of personal responsibility because taking Coolidge's advice would lead to two people being distressed by his actions instead of one. Also in one of the movie's most memorable lines, he underscores the philosophical difference between them when he says "here's something that doesn't cost you 25 bucks an hour.....you carry your own water Ellery......you understand? You carry your own water". "Mulholland Falls" boasts a star studded cast and some superb performances. Nolte is perfect in his role as someone who's tough, hard drinking, guilt ridden and given to outbursts of uncontrollable rage. John Malkovich excels as the eccentric Timms who says that "some people must die before their time so that others can live. It's a cornerstone of civilisation". Madsen and Penn are excellent in their support roles and Jennifer Conelly and Melanie Griffith both make a strong impression as women who unjustly experience very cruel treatment. There are also a number of great cameos to look out for from Andrew McCarthy, Louise Fletcher, Bruce Dern and Rob Lowe and even an exquisite rendition of "Harbour Lights" by Aaron Neville.

    This film looks fantastic and is chock-full of great actors(Nick Nolte, Melanie Griffith, Chris Penn, Bruce Dern, John Malkovich, Chazz Palminteri, and more). A low-brow Chinatown. The 'look' of this film, and Nick Nolte's performance are the only things that are even close to the level of that earlier, finer work. However, this is well worth a view - especially if you are looking for a throwback escape from all the new release trash that's out there today. Sidenote: Jennifer Connelly's breasts should be the standard of perfection. Some of the fine actors have to take a backseat because there are just so many involved here. Nolte, however, is the star of this show, and his performance is definitely noteworthy. It's Nick's performance, and Tomahori's attention to graphic detail that make this film above average. The plot is an atomic bomb. You'll like this if you liked: Black Dahlia, L.A. Confidential(note: this movie is nowhere near that level), Miller's Crossing and Basic Instinct. 64/100

    When I watched this film recently I thought that it must have been made by people trying to capitalize on the success of L.A. Confidential. It has the same look and it has nothing short of a phenomenal cast list. But it actually came out a year before L.A. Confidential. I suspect that the L.A. Confidential producers wee quaking in their boots after this attempted film noir bombed at the box office. But of course, L.A. Confidential turned out to be a great success and is remembered as one of the truly great modern film noirs, combining all of the best features of a great film, and getting that 40's and 50's feeling just right. About all the Mulholland Falls gets right is the 40's and 50's feeling. But the cast of the Hat Squad come off as almost comic book figures. They drive around town in a big convertible but their hats never even flicker, less blow off in the breeze, even when they are trying to outrace an Army jeep at a nuclear test site. Indoors, they take off their coats but never their hats. The pace of the movie is glacially slow. It's difficult to stay awake. The writing is sub-par and all too predictable. The two talented and beautiful women in the movie, Melanie Griffith and Jennifer Connelly are largely wasted with relatively little screen time. In one comical scene Connelly is slapped by her mobster boyfriend and barely flinches. She returns the slap and almost knocks the guy over. Aren't mobsters supposed to be able to hit better than that? Or at least take a slap from a girl? Parts of the plot are beyond ridiculous. At the nuclear test site, the Hat Squad takes off down a road marked restricted, shoots the padlock off a locked gate, and then acts surprised when the Army comes after them. And John Malkovich as an effete and intellectual Army general in a red smoking jacket is so out of place to be absurd. Continuity is also a shambles in this film. During the airplane fight, Treat Williams has one of the rip cords from a parachute tied around his neck as he is thrown to the floor of the plane in front of the door. The next shot is a close-up of him sitting on the floor and the cord is mysteriously gone. At the end of the film, the three surviving members of the Hat Squad place their hats on the coffin of their fallen comrade. Nick Nolte then proceeds to put on his hat (not the one on the coffin) as they walk away. Where did that hat come from? The film has its moments but its poor writing and incredibly slow pace waste a great cast that tries as best they can to overcome the deficiencies of a crummy plot.

    With all the names in this film you'd think it would be "can't miss" material. The setting, in some respect, is challenging: MF is going to be compared to CHINATOWN and LA CONFIDENTIAL. Those two classics have nothing to fear. What MF offers is nothing more than ridiculous. The introductory scene has our fabulous four murdering a supposed mobster, though the only evil we know of the victim is sarcasm. Bad move. We are soon instructed to love the characters as altruistic. A significant portion of the film is the fab four riding around in their car wherein we're supposed to be entertained by unfunny and distracting banter. The plot is relatively simple and just gets dumber and dumberer. The casting of Nick Nolte is a mistake: We need a less intimidating character. Melanie Griffen and Andrew McCarthy give great performances that are wasted. John Malkovich and Treat Williams go through the motions. The sets and costumes are great, but the film's actual stars are Jennifer Connelly's breasts, variously covered and uncovered. What a waste of time and money.

    A top drawer cast stars in "Mulholland Falls," a 1996 film starring Nick Nolte, Chazz Palmentieri, Melanie Griffith, Jennifer Connelly, Michael Madsen, Treat Williams, Bruce Dern, and John Malkovich, directed by New Zealand director Lee Tamahori. Sometimes when I don't know the year of a film, I try to guess. I placed this film in 1998 because I concluded it must have come after "L.A. Confidential" since it's about '50s crime investigation. Also, Jennifer Connelly is very young here - reminiscent of the way she looked in "Dark City." I was two years off. The story concerns the L.A. Hat Squad, led by Max Hoover (Nolte) called to investigate the brutal murder of Allison Pond (Jennifer Connelly). When her body is turned over, Hoover realizes it's an ex-girlfriend. He's never told his wife (Melanie Griffith) about the affair, stating that he had the affair, it ended, no one got hurt, and to tell her would hurt her deeply. The investigation of the murder leads to a general (John Malkovich), an atom bomb testing site, secret film footage, and military secrets. Very good performances from everyone - had Nolte been able to keep his life together, he could have been up there with the very greatest. He's always been capable of truly great performances, all the way back to the "Rich Man, Poor Man" days. Here one can feel his tremendous sadness and weariness. It's a pall that hangs over the entire film. Jennifer Connelly, whose part isn't very large, is gorgeous, sexy, and tough. Melanie Griffith gives a mature performance as Hoover's wife. Uncredited in the film are Rob Lowe and Louise Fletcher. There is a very exciting scene at the end of the movie. "Mulholland Falls" never received the attention that "L.A. Confidential" did. One can blame marketing, but the story isn't special enough, the characters not as well delineated, and the pace is a bit too leisurely. This isn't to say it's not a good film. It's just not exceptional. I applaud anyone who does a period noir that comes off like a noir and not a bad attempt. There, "Mullholland Falls" succeeds admirably.

    By the numbers but engaging thriller with an eye on noir of old, Mulholland Falls is a sporadically interesting film about a man facing his past and confronting the present.

    I quite like films like Mulholland Falls; films about shady, down-beat and supposedly emotionless American detectives searching for something dear as they do their best to hide the fact that it means that much to them. Films that are daft enough but enjoyable enough to have their leads be able to spot vital clues linked to the overall success of their goal whilst being in a state of near intoxication by way of hard alcohol. Nick Nolte's character does this towards the end of Mulholland Falls when watching a short, silent piece of moving image footage, but there you go. The film itself is a dank and involving noir inspired thriller from 1996 about corruption and murder amidst the higher-ups of the nation and one man's quest to uncover it; only, he doesn't know it at the time. The beauty of these stories is that they establish a hard-as-nails male lead whom keeps within his little pool of dishing out pain and retribution, effectively, before broadening them out into a wider scope of scum and dispute; the catch being that the negative characteristics on these outside of the pool are tougher to spot: they're still there, but they hide amidst this sea of expensive furniture, clothing and generally plush mise-en-scene. The film begins with two 8MM pieces of film footage that we feel we have no right to observe: some blast footage of an atomic weapon being tested and therefore detonated, exemplified when we sporadically cut to another film and an army official pushing the camera operator, ie; the audience, away from the general area; as well as another film in which a mounted camera is pointing at two people about to engage in sexual activity. Such is the tone the film will take, and such is the battle the lead has on him that in order to succeed in his mission, he'll need to break on through and confront things that certain others would rather you wouldn't see or realise were there. Corruption is a rife and pleasurable theme for classical film noir, or more contemporary noirs that pay homage; corruption usually equating to cheating, lying or deception and when the general ingredients are on the money; the piece ends up worth seeing. The film would have you think it's about four guys, police officers in 1950s Los Angeles, taking names and kicking their way around town, bullying those they deem guilty of whatever crime by tossing them down a hill just off Mulholland Drive. At least it might've been about that had it been set several years prior to events here. Here, Nolte's cop named Max Hoover gets in way over his head and finds himself on a road to all things dangerous when he and his crew come across a woman firmly embedded within the ground out in the open wilderness nearby a construction site. It looks like she's hit the ground from a great height, but everyone's puzzled as to how it might have happened. Further more, Hoover knows the girl from recent times. Hoover has a wife he struggles to truly connect with over the course of the film, she's young; attractive and enjoys reading Hemingway, but like most films about butch men working together for the greater-good; Mulholland Falls is more interested in a relationship between two males, that of Hoover and Chazz Palminteri's cop Elleroy Coolidge, a guy in that group of four which also consisted of Michael Madsen and Chris Penn  but loosing both of them would do the film no harm. The death of the young girl, a certain Allison Pond (Connelly), affects Hoover in ways that doesn't see him afraid to admit to, purely because he once upon a time had an affair with her, rendering the investigation somewhat personal rather than just strictly business. What do we come to learn of Palminteri's character? Well, we learn that it's not wise to back chat him just prior to taking a drink out of a glass full of something, but we also come to find of the issues he carries; someone whom it is revealed suffers from personal problems of his own and much to some of the other hard-nosed archetype cop's confusion; his issues and the exploration of them somewhat going against what it is that makes these archetypes in these sorts of films so recognisable. Coolidge's thoughts on the Western film genre, for one, is supposed to signify a broader sense of thinking away from all the hard-nosed work while his linking this to thoughts on the ramifications certain events have on future items display a meek sense of sensory awareness. It is no coincidence then that the two find a degree of solace with one another and it ought not be much of a surprise to see Coolidge connect with Hoover in the way they do; one coming to the other's aid and sharing the burden of the film's denouement together. The film eventually branches out into a feud between those within the world of the 'just', a sort of documentation of the birth of internal affairs, only not making out that that's what it is particularly evident; instead delivering dramatically rather than historically a tight enough narrative to do with corruption and 'the enemy within' linked to the F.B.I. and The U.S. Army. Yes, there are sequences that feel patched on; yes, we know exactly who'll survive and who won't survive certain gunfights half way through and yes, it really could do without two of its four leads of whom the film barely makes any attempt to really get the most out of the performers in question, but Mulholland Falls is a knowing if somewhat flimsy tale of a man's life coming apart as he confronts past mistakes and current ones on the state's behalf.

    This movie needed more Jennifer Connelly, and it needed to be in black and white. I'm sorry, but noir never really works for me unless it's steeped in shadows and a colorless world. That's just what I've been conditioned to expect from a good noir movie. If Mulholland Falls would have been set in the modern day, I think that the color wouldn't have bothered me as much, but the combination of the time period and the style makes the colorization just to much for me to tolerate. As for Jennifer, she's the crux of the film, but we don't get to spend very much time at all with her. We don't get a sense of who she is and why she did the things that she did, and that greatly lessens the impact of her death. If you don't care about the core of the story, then it's difficult to have any real investment in the rest of the movie. In all honesty, even if the movie was in black and white and Jennifer Connelly had two times more scenes, this movie would probably still be boring. I just never cared or was interested in what was going on. Michael Madsen was wasted, there wasn't nearly enough of John Malkovich, and Nick Nolte was just smacking people and looking grim. Mulholland Falls gets two stars for Jennifer Connelly's magnificence, but even her wonders barely made it worth watching.

    "Mulholland Falls" is a murder mystery which, at the time of its release, failed to achieve a very positive response from either the critics or the public. This is unfortunate because it does have a number of qualities which make it both entertaining and praiseworthy and its evocation of the period in which it's set (the early 1950s) is both visually impressive and atmospheric. Director Lee Tamahori and cinematographer Haskell Wexler deserve credit for this as does Dave Grusin who was responsible for the marvellous original score. In typical film noir style, the main protagonist (in this case a police detective) finds himself in a situation in which he's out of his depth and then finds that further developments just continue to make things worse as he follows a route which seems destined to take him into a state of being both morally and emotionally impoverished. Max Hoover (Nick Nolte) is the leader of a squad of four LAPD detectives whose job is to get rid of gangsters and criminals and they do this very effectively. Their modus operandi is to dispense justice in a very brutal and unorthodox manner and they're able to do this with impunity because they have the support of their Chief of Police (Bruce Dern). When a woman's dead body is found at a construction site and the squad investigate, it soon emerges that she was Allison Pond (Jennifer Connelly). Pond was an aspiring actress and Hoover is shaken by what he finds because he'd previously had a six month affair with her before deciding to end the relationship. Shortly after, a film is discovered which shows Pond having sex with a man who turns out to be General Thomas Timms (John Malkovich). Timms is the head of the Atomic Energy Commission and when the squad continue their investigation they soon come up against hostility and threats from Colonel Fitzgerald (Treat Williams) and FBI Agent McCafferty (Daniel Baldwin) before discovering the existence of a conspiracy to conceal the activities of personnel at a military base where atomic bomb tests had been carried out. The anguish that Hoover experiences during this case is worsened when a film showing one of his encounters with Allison Pond comes into the possession of his wife Katherine (Melanie Griffith). Although he'd eventually finished his affair with Pond because he'd cared more for his wife, the pain of discovering his infidelity is no less intense for Katherine who is totally heartbroken. The reason why Pond was murdered is gradually revealed and Hoover and his partner Ellery Coolidge (Chazz Palminteri) have to engage in a frantic fight for their lives before the story comes to its sombre conclusion. Hoover's squad, which also comprises Coolidge, Eddie Hall (Michael Madsen) and Arthur Relyea (Chris Penn) is great fun to watch as its members swagger around in stylish suits or cruise around in a Buick convertible. The picture of the four of them standing on the edge of a bomb crater is also particularly striking. The closest relationship within the squad is between Hoover and Coolidge and in a significant departure from the otherwise macho ethos of the group, Coolidge is not only undergoing a course of counselling to deal with his temper and food issues but has also completely bought into the benefits of psychotherapy. When Hoover is worried about Katherine finding out about his affair, Coolidge suggests talking the matter through to reach a solution. This suggestion doesn't sit well with Hoover who sees it as an abdication of personal responsibility because taking Coolidge's advice would lead to two people being distressed by his actions instead of one. Also in one of the movie's most memorable lines, he underscores the philosophical difference between them when he says "here's something that doesn't cost you 25 bucks an hour.....you carry your own water Ellery......you understand? You carry your own water". "Mulholland Falls" boasts a star studded cast and some superb performances. Nolte is perfect in his role as someone who's tough, hard drinking, guilt ridden and given to outbursts of uncontrollable rage. John Malkovich excels as the eccentric Timms who says that "some people must die before their time so that others can live. It's a cornerstone of civilisation". Madsen and Penn are excellent in their support roles and Jennifer Conelly and Melanie Griffith both make a strong impression as women who unjustly experience very cruel treatment. There are also a number of great cameos to look out for from Andrew McCarthy, Louise Fletcher, Bruce Dern and Rob Lowe and even an exquisite rendition of "Harbour Lights" by Aaron Neville.

    Mulholland Falls is directed by Lee Tamahori and written by Pete Dexter. It stars Nick Nolte, Chazz Palminteri, Melanie Griffith, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, Jennifer Connelly, Treat Williams, John Malkovich, Bruce Dern and Andrew McCarthy. Music is by Dave Grusin and cinematography by Haskell Wexler. 1950s Los Angeles and four unorthodox detectives led by Maxwell Hoover (Nolte) are called in to investigate the death of a young woman found crushed at a construction site. The woman is revealed to be an aspiring actress who had recently had a relationship with the married Hoover. Can is open, and worms everywhere, and following those worms leads Hoover down murky avenues... It's the almost nearly great neo-noir movie, everything looks right in principal, it has a strongly assembled cast, the 50s visuals and cinematography are splendid, and the murder mystery element of the plot - with some added sex, sizzle and nuclear shenanigans - looks promising on the page. Yet it never delivers on that promise of being something dark, to be a labyrinthine noir thriller beating a black heart. It starts of so well, based on the infamous "Hat Squad" we reasonably expect the story to expand upon the opening macho machinations of the four tough hombres in the hats, but instead away from Nolte's grizzled Hoover, the other three guys are merely dressed up props. Which means there's some good actors wasted, sadly. As the plot moves slowly forward the investigation and Hoover character axis becomes less interesting. Griffith came in for some critical grief for a lacklustre performance, but she's done no favours by the writers who fail to give her marriage to Hoover any substance. So when things go pear shaped and the characters of Mr and Mrs Hoover should explode on the screen, we really don't care having had no interest previously to hang our emotional being on. It all builds to what can best be described as a poor pay off, the resolution to the hinted at muddy mystery is hardly shocking, and the "big" face-off sequence between good and bad guys (or bad and bad if you prefer) is about as exciting as watching paint dry. It's not an awful movie, but it is a very disappointing one. A film where a bit more thought given by the producers could have yielded so much more. 5/10

    I've found that if I somehow leave the room for food or a break, the film probably isn't really very good. Good or better keep me glued. I never left my seat during Mulholland Falls and from the opening sequences with the four LA cops in hats riding up sunny 1950's Hollywood Hills in a big black convertible, I was hooked. Hooked especially by a galvanizing, snappy performance by Nick Nolte as Hoover, head of his squad of four, a man of action before words, a man who simmers and glares and loves with passion: it's a performance that somehow should have been given more attention at the time of the film's release, a cops and crime film which somehow didn't match the zeitgeist of its period, lost in the shuffle. Almost every noir mystery past 1949 is a retread of some sort (Chinatown being a major exception),but what makes Mulholland Falls work is not the plot but the heady collection of dedicated supporting actors whether Melanie Griffith as a quietly restrained wife of a cop, or Chazz Palminteri, the wry right hand partner who talks about his psychiatrist without hesitation. The mystery deals with corruption in high places, of course, and John Malkovich and Treat Williams are good supports for Nolte to play against--but it's Nolte's show from start to finish and his intensity nails it!

    Wanna be L.A. Confidential was surprisingly released the year before but everything that that film got right this one gets wrong. The sets and costumes are pristine, not a single crease or smudge, that's the problem with them, everything looks new-not lived in. The actors some like Nolte and Madsen who would seem to be ideal for the period are as at sea as the miscast actors like Andrew McCarthy, who gives a fussy unconvincing turn, all are stiff and give no sense of actually living in the time period, everything feels very staged. The main fault lies with the director who doesn't seem to have a real feeling for the material and just wants to create pretty pictures. Adequate but nothing more.

    I quite like films like Mulholland Falls; films about shady, down-beat and supposedly emotionless American detectives searching for something dear as they do their best to hide the fact that it means that much to them. Films that are daft enough but enjoyable enough to have their leads be able to spot vital clues linked to the overall success of their goal whilst being in a state of near intoxication by way of hard alcohol. Nick Nolte's character does this towards the end of Mulholland Falls when watching a short, silent piece of moving image footage, but there you go. The film itself is a dank and involving noir inspired thriller from 1996 about corruption and murder amidst the higher-ups of the nation and one man's quest to uncover it; only, he doesn't know it at the time. The beauty of these stories is that they establish a hard-as-nails male lead whom keeps within his little pool of dishing out pain and retribution, effectively, before broadening them out into a wider scope of scum and dispute; the catch being that the negative characteristics on these outside of the pool are tougher to spot: they're still there, but they hide amidst this sea of expensive furniture, clothing and generally plush mise-en-scene. The film begins with two 8MM pieces of film footage that we feel we have no right to observe: some blast footage of an atomic weapon being tested and therefore detonated, exemplified when we sporadically cut to another film and an army official pushing the camera operator, ie; the audience, away from the general area; as well as another film in which a mounted camera is pointing at two people about to engage in sexual activity. Such is the tone the film will take, and such is the battle the lead has on him that in order to succeed in his mission, he'll need to break on through and confront things that certain others would rather you wouldn't see or realise were there. Corruption is a rife and pleasurable theme for classical film noir, or more contemporary noirs that pay homage; corruption usually equating to cheating, lying or deception and when the general ingredients are on the money; the piece ends up worth seeing. The film would have you think it's about four guys, police officers in 1950s Los Angeles, taking names and kicking their way around town, bullying those they deem guilty of whatever crime by tossing them down a hill just off Mulholland Drive. At least it might've been about that had it been set several years prior to events here. Here, Nolte's cop named Max Hoover gets in way over his head and finds himself on a road to all things dangerous when he and his crew come across a woman firmly embedded within the ground out in the open wilderness nearby a construction site. It looks like she's hit the ground from a great height, but everyone's puzzled as to how it might have happened. Further more, Hoover knows the girl from recent times. Hoover has a wife he struggles to truly connect with over the course of the film, she's young; attractive and enjoys reading Hemingway, but like most films about butch men working together for the greater-good; Mulholland Falls is more interested in a relationship between two males, that of Hoover and Chazz Palminteri's cop Elleroy Coolidge, a guy in that group of four which also consisted of Michael Madsen and Chris Penn  but loosing both of them would do the film no harm. The death of the young girl, a certain Allison Pond (Connelly), affects Hoover in ways that doesn't see him afraid to admit to, purely because he once upon a time had an affair with her, rendering the investigation somewhat personal rather than just strictly business. What do we come to learn of Palminteri's character? Well, we learn that it's not wise to back chat him just prior to taking a drink out of a glass full of something, but we also come to find of the issues he carries; someone whom it is revealed suffers from personal problems of his own and much to some of the other hard-nosed archetype cop's confusion; his issues and the exploration of them somewhat going against what it is that makes these archetypes in these sorts of films so recognisable. Coolidge's thoughts on the Western film genre, for one, is supposed to signify a broader sense of thinking away from all the hard-nosed work while his linking this to thoughts on the ramifications certain events have on future items display a meek sense of sensory awareness. It is no coincidence then that the two find a degree of solace with one another and it ought not be much of a surprise to see Coolidge connect with Hoover in the way they do; one coming to the other's aid and sharing the burden of the film's denouement together. The film eventually branches out into a feud between those within the world of the 'just', a sort of documentation of the birth of internal affairs, only not making out that that's what it is particularly evident; instead delivering dramatically rather than historically a tight enough narrative to do with corruption and 'the enemy within' linked to the F.B.I. and The U.S. Army. Yes, there are sequences that feel patched on; yes, we know exactly who'll survive and who won't survive certain gunfights half way through and yes, it really could do without two of its four leads of whom the film barely makes any attempt to really get the most out of the performers in question, but Mulholland Falls is a knowing if somewhat flimsy tale of a man's life coming apart as he confronts past mistakes and current ones on the state's behalf.

    This movie needed more Jennifer Connelly, and it needed to be in black and white. I'm sorry, but noir never really works for me unless it's steeped in shadows and a colorless world. That's just what I've been conditioned to expect from a good noir movie. If Mulholland Falls would have been set in the modern day, I think that the color wouldn't have bothered me as much, but the combination of the time period and the style makes the colorization just to much for me to tolerate. As for Jennifer, she's the crux of the film, but we don't get to spend very much time at all with her. We don't get a sense of who she is and why she did the things that she did, and that greatly lessens the impact of her death. If you don't care about the core of the story, then it's difficult to have any real investment in the rest of the movie. In all honesty, even if the movie was in black and white and Jennifer Connelly had two times more scenes, this movie would probably still be boring. I just never cared or was interested in what was going on. Michael Madsen was wasted, there wasn't nearly enough of John Malkovich, and Nick Nolte was just smacking people and looking grim. Mulholland Falls gets two stars for Jennifer Connelly's magnificence, but even her wonders barely made it worth watching.

    "Mulholland Falls" is a murder mystery which, at the time of its release, failed to achieve a very positive response from either the critics or the public. This is unfortunate because it does have a number of qualities which make it both entertaining and praiseworthy and its evocation of the period in which it's set (the early 1950s) is both visually impressive and atmospheric. Director Lee Tamahori and cinematographer Haskell Wexler deserve credit for this as does Dave Grusin who was responsible for the marvellous original score. In typical film noir style, the main protagonist (in this case a police detective) finds himself in a situation in which he's out of his depth and then finds that further developments just continue to make things worse as he follows a route which seems destined to take him into a state of being both morally and emotionally impoverished. Max Hoover (Nick Nolte) is the leader of a squad of four LAPD detectives whose job is to get rid of gangsters and criminals and they do this very effectively. Their modus operandi is to dispense justice in a very brutal and unorthodox manner and they're able to do this with impunity because they have the support of their Chief of Police (Bruce Dern). When a woman's dead body is found at a construction site and the squad investigate, it soon emerges that she was Allison Pond (Jennifer Connelly). Pond was an aspiring actress and Hoover is shaken by what he finds because he'd previously had a six month affair with her before deciding to end the relationship. Shortly after, a film is discovered which shows Pond having sex with a man who turns out to be General Thomas Timms (John Malkovich). Timms is the head of the Atomic Energy Commission and when the squad continue their investigation they soon come up against hostility and threats from Colonel Fitzgerald (Treat Williams) and FBI Agent McCafferty (Daniel Baldwin) before discovering the existence of a conspiracy to conceal the activities of personnel at a military base where atomic bomb tests had been carried out. The anguish that Hoover experiences during this case is worsened when a film showing one of his encounters with Allison Pond comes into the possession of his wife Katherine (Melanie Griffith). Although he'd eventually finished his affair with Pond because he'd cared more for his wife, the pain of discovering his infidelity is no less intense for Katherine who is totally heartbroken. The reason why Pond was murdered is gradually revealed and Hoover and his partner Ellery Coolidge (Chazz Palminteri) have to engage in a frantic fight for their lives before the story comes to its sombre conclusion. Hoover's squad, which also comprises Coolidge, Eddie Hall (Michael Madsen) and Arthur Relyea (Chris Penn) is great fun to watch as its members swagger around in stylish suits or cruise around in a Buick convertible. The picture of the four of them standing on the edge of a bomb crater is also particularly striking. The closest relationship within the squad is between Hoover and Coolidge and in a significant departure from the otherwise macho ethos of the group, Coolidge is not only undergoing a course of counselling to deal with his temper and food issues but has also completely bought into the benefits of psychotherapy. When Hoover is worried about Katherine finding out about his affair, Coolidge suggests talking the matter through to reach a solution. This suggestion doesn't sit well with Hoover who sees it as an abdication of personal responsibility because taking Coolidge's advice would lead to two people being distressed by his actions instead of one. Also in one of the movie's most memorable lines, he underscores the philosophical difference between them when he says "here's something that doesn't cost you 25 bucks an hour.....you carry your own water Ellery......you understand? You carry your own water". "Mulholland Falls" boasts a star studded cast and some superb performances. Nolte is perfect in his role as someone who's tough, hard drinking, guilt ridden and given to outbursts of uncontrollable rage. John Malkovich excels as the eccentric Timms who says that "some people must die before their time so that others can live. It's a cornerstone of civilisation". Madsen and Penn are excellent in their support roles and Jennifer Conelly and Melanie Griffith both make a strong impression as women who unjustly experience very cruel treatment. There are also a number of great cameos to look out for from Andrew McCarthy, Louise Fletcher, Bruce Dern and Rob Lowe and even an exquisite rendition of "Harbour Lights" by Aaron Neville.

    Mulholland Falls is directed by Lee Tamahori and written by Pete Dexter. It stars Nick Nolte, Chazz Palminteri, Melanie Griffith, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, Jennifer Connelly, Treat Williams, John Malkovich, Bruce Dern and Andrew McCarthy. Music is by Dave Grusin and cinematography by Haskell Wexler. 1950s Los Angeles and four unorthodox detectives led by Maxwell Hoover (Nolte) are called in to investigate the death of a young woman found crushed at a construction site. The woman is revealed to be an aspiring actress who had recently had a relationship with the married Hoover. Can is open, and worms everywhere, and following those worms leads Hoover down murky avenues... It's the almost nearly great neo-noir movie, everything looks right in principal, it has a strongly assembled cast, the 50s visuals and cinematography are splendid, and the murder mystery element of the plot - with some added sex, sizzle and nuclear shenanigans - looks promising on the page. Yet it never delivers on that promise of being something dark, to be a labyrinthine noir thriller beating a black heart. It starts of so well, based on the infamous "Hat Squad" we reasonably expect the story to expand upon the opening macho machinations of the four tough hombres in the hats, but instead away from Nolte's grizzled Hoover, the other three guys are merely dressed up props. Which means there's some good actors wasted, sadly. As the plot moves slowly forward the investigation and Hoover character axis becomes less interesting. Griffith came in for some critical grief for a lacklustre performance, but she's done no favours by the writers who fail to give her marriage to Hoover any substance. So when things go pear shaped and the characters of Mr and Mrs Hoover should explode on the screen, we really don't care having had no interest previously to hang our emotional being on. It all builds to what can best be described as a poor pay off, the resolution to the hinted at muddy mystery is hardly shocking, and the "big" face-off sequence between good and bad guys (or bad and bad if you prefer) is about as exciting as watching paint dry. It's not an awful movie, but it is a very disappointing one. A film where a bit more thought given by the producers could have yielded so much more. 5/10

    I've found that if I somehow leave the room for food or a break, the film probably isn't really very good. Good or better keep me glued. I never left my seat during Mulholland Falls and from the opening sequences with the four LA cops in hats riding up sunny 1950's Hollywood Hills in a big black convertible, I was hooked. Hooked especially by a galvanizing, snappy performance by Nick Nolte as Hoover, head of his squad of four, a man of action before words, a man who simmers and glares and loves with passion: it's a performance that somehow should have been given more attention at the time of the film's release, a cops and crime film which somehow didn't match the zeitgeist of its period, lost in the shuffle. Almost every noir mystery past 1949 is a retread of some sort (Chinatown being a major exception),but what makes Mulholland Falls work is not the plot but the heady collection of dedicated supporting actors whether Melanie Griffith as a quietly restrained wife of a cop, or Chazz Palminteri, the wry right hand partner who talks about his psychiatrist without hesitation. The mystery deals with corruption in high places, of course, and John Malkovich and Treat Williams are good supports for Nolte to play against--but it's Nolte's show from start to finish and his intensity nails it!

    Wanna be L.A. Confidential was surprisingly released the year before but everything that that film got right this one gets wrong. The sets and costumes are pristine, not a single crease or smudge, that's the problem with them, everything looks new-not lived in. The actors some like Nolte and Madsen who would seem to be ideal for the period are as at sea as the miscast actors like Andrew McCarthy, who gives a fussy unconvincing turn, all are stiff and give no sense of actually living in the time period, everything feels very staged. The main fault lies with the director who doesn't seem to have a real feeling for the material and just wants to create pretty pictures. Adequate but nothing more.

    This film looks fantastic and is chock-full of great actors(Nick Nolte, Melanie Griffith, Chris Penn, Bruce Dern, John Malkovich, Chazz Palminteri, and more). A low-brow Chinatown. The 'look' of this film, and Nick Nolte's performance are the only things that are even close to the level of that earlier, finer work. However, this is well worth a view - especially if you are looking for a throwback escape from all the new release trash that's out there today. Sidenote: Jennifer Connelly's breasts should be the standard of perfection. Some of the fine actors have to take a backseat because there are just so many involved here. Nolte, however, is the star of this show, and his performance is definitely noteworthy. It's Nick's performance, and Tomahori's attention to graphic detail that make this film above average. The plot is an atomic bomb. You'll like this if you liked: Black Dahlia, L.A. Confidential(note: this movie is nowhere near that level), Miller's Crossing and Basic Instinct. 64/100

    When I watched this film recently I thought that it must have been made by people trying to capitalize on the success of L.A. Confidential. It has the same look and it has nothing short of a phenomenal cast list. But it actually came out a year before L.A. Confidential. I suspect that the L.A. Confidential producers wee quaking in their boots after this attempted film noir bombed at the box office. But of course, L.A. Confidential turned out to be a great success and is remembered as one of the truly great modern film noirs, combining all of the best features of a great film, and getting that 40's and 50's feeling just right. About all the Mulholland Falls gets right is the 40's and 50's feeling. But the cast of the Hat Squad come off as almost comic book figures. They drive around town in a big convertible but their hats never even flicker, less blow off in the breeze, even when they are trying to outrace an Army jeep at a nuclear test site. Indoors, they take off their coats but never their hats. The pace of the movie is glacially slow. It's difficult to stay awake. The writing is sub-par and all too predictable. The two talented and beautiful women in the movie, Melanie Griffith and Jennifer Connelly are largely wasted with relatively little screen time. In one comical scene Connelly is slapped by her mobster boyfriend and barely flinches. She returns the slap and almost knocks the guy over. Aren't mobsters supposed to be able to hit better than that? Or at least take a slap from a girl? Parts of the plot are beyond ridiculous. At the nuclear test site, the Hat Squad takes off down a road marked restricted, shoots the padlock off a locked gate, and then acts surprised when the Army comes after them. And John Malkovich as an effete and intellectual Army general in a red smoking jacket is so out of place to be absurd. Continuity is also a shambles in this film. During the airplane fight, Treat Williams has one of the rip cords from a parachute tied around his neck as he is thrown to the floor of the plane in front of the door. The next shot is a close-up of him sitting on the floor and the cord is mysteriously gone. At the end of the film, the three surviving members of the Hat Squad place their hats on the coffin of their fallen comrade. Nick Nolte then proceeds to put on his hat (not the one on the coffin) as they walk away. Where did that hat come from? The film has its moments but its poor writing and incredibly slow pace waste a great cast that tries as best they can to overcome the deficiencies of a crummy plot.

    With all the names in this film you'd think it would be "can't miss" material. The setting, in some respect, is challenging: MF is going to be compared to CHINATOWN and LA CONFIDENTIAL. Those two classics have nothing to fear. What MF offers is nothing more than ridiculous. The introductory scene has our fabulous four murdering a supposed mobster, though the only evil we know of the victim is sarcasm. Bad move. We are soon instructed to love the characters as altruistic. A significant portion of the film is the fab four riding around in their car wherein we're supposed to be entertained by unfunny and distracting banter. The plot is relatively simple and just gets dumber and dumberer. The casting of Nick Nolte is a mistake: We need a less intimidating character. Melanie Griffen and Andrew McCarthy give great performances that are wasted. John Malkovich and Treat Williams go through the motions. The sets and costumes are great, but the film's actual stars are Jennifer Connelly's breasts, variously covered and uncovered. What a waste of time and money.

    A top drawer cast stars in "Mulholland Falls," a 1996 film starring Nick Nolte, Chazz Palmentieri, Melanie Griffith, Jennifer Connelly, Michael Madsen, Treat Williams, Bruce Dern, and John Malkovich, directed by New Zealand director Lee Tamahori. Sometimes when I don't know the year of a film, I try to guess. I placed this film in 1998 because I concluded it must have come after "L.A. Confidential" since it's about '50s crime investigation. Also, Jennifer Connelly is very young here - reminiscent of the way she looked in "Dark City." I was two years off. The story concerns the L.A. Hat Squad, led by Max Hoover (Nolte) called to investigate the brutal murder of Allison Pond (Jennifer Connelly). When her body is turned over, Hoover realizes it's an ex-girlfriend. He's never told his wife (Melanie Griffith) about the affair, stating that he had the affair, it ended, no one got hurt, and to tell her would hurt her deeply. The investigation of the murder leads to a general (John Malkovich), an atom bomb testing site, secret film footage, and military secrets. Very good performances from everyone - had Nolte been able to keep his life together, he could have been up there with the very greatest. He's always been capable of truly great performances, all the way back to the "Rich Man, Poor Man" days. Here one can feel his tremendous sadness and weariness. It's a pall that hangs over the entire film. Jennifer Connelly, whose part isn't very large, is gorgeous, sexy, and tough. Melanie Griffith gives a mature performance as Hoover's wife. Uncredited in the film are Rob Lowe and Louise Fletcher. There is a very exciting scene at the end of the movie. "Mulholland Falls" never received the attention that "L.A. Confidential" did. One can blame marketing, but the story isn't special enough, the characters not as well delineated, and the pace is a bit too leisurely. This isn't to say it's not a good film. It's just not exceptional. I applaud anyone who does a period noir that comes off like a noir and not a bad attempt. There, "Mullholland Falls" succeeds admirably.

In typical film noir style, the main protagonist (in this case a police detective) finds himself in a situation in which he's out of his depth and then finds that further developments just continue to make things worse as he follows a route which seems destined to take him into a state of being both morally and emotionally impoverished. Max Hoover (Nick Nolte) is the leader of a squad of four LAPD detectives whose job is to get rid of gangsters and criminals and they do this very effectively. Their modus operandi is to dispense justice in a very brutal and unorthodox manner and they're able to do this with impunity because they have the support of their Chief of Police (Bruce Dern). When a woman's dead body is found at a construction site and the squad investigate, it soon emerges that she was Allison Pond (Jennifer Connelly). Pond was an aspiring actress and Hoover is shaken by what he finds because he'd previously had a six month affair with her before deciding to end the relationship. Shortly after, a film is discovered which shows Pond having sex with a man who turns out to be General Thomas Timms (John Malkovich). Timms is the head of the Atomic Energy Commission and when the squad continue their investigation they soon come up against hostility and threats from Colonel Fitzgerald (Treat Williams) and FBI Agent McCafferty (Daniel Baldwin) before discovering the existence of a conspiracy to conceal the activities of personnel at a military base where atomic bomb tests had been carried out. The anguish that Hoover experiences during this case is worsened when a film showing one of his encounters with Allison Pond comes into the possession of his wife Katherine (Melanie Griffith). Although he'd eventually finished his affair with Pond because he'd cared more for his wife, the pain of discovering his infidelity is no less intense for Katherine who is totally heartbroken. The reason why Pond was murdered is gradually revealed and Hoover and his partner Ellery Coolidge (Chazz Palminteri) have to engage in a frantic fight for their lives before the story comes to its sombre conclusion. Hoover's squad, which also comprises Coolidge, Eddie Hall (Michael Madsen) and Arthur Relyea (Chris Penn) is great fun to watch as its members swagger around in stylish suits or cruise around in a Buick convertible. The picture of the four of them standing on the edge of a bomb crater is also particularly striking. The closest relationship within the squad is between Hoover and Coolidge and in a significant departure from the otherwise macho ethos of the group, Coolidge is not only undergoing a course of counselling to deal with his temper and food issues but has also completely bought into the benefits of psychotherapy. When Hoover is worried about Katherine finding out about his affair, Coolidge suggests talking the matter through to reach a solution. This suggestion doesn't sit well with Hoover who sees it as an abdication of personal responsibility because taking Coolidge's advice would lead to two people being distressed by his actions instead of one. Also in one of the movie's most memorable lines, he underscores the philosophical difference between them when he says "here's something that doesn't cost you 25 bucks an hour.....you carry your own water Ellery......you understand? You carry your own water". "Mulholland Falls" boasts a star studded cast and some superb performances. Nolte is perfect in his role as someone who's tough, hard drinking, guilt ridden and given to outbursts of uncontrollable rage. John Malkovich excels as the eccentric Timms who says that "some people must die before their time so that others can live. It's a cornerstone of civilisation". Madsen and Penn are excellent in their support roles and Jennifer Conelly and Melanie Griffith both make a strong impression as women who unjustly experience very cruel treatment. There are also a number of great cameos to look out for from Andrew McCarthy, Louise Fletcher, Bruce Dern and Rob Lowe and even an exquisite rendition of "Harbour Lights" by Aaron Neville.

    Mulholland Falls is directed by Lee Tamahori and written by Pete Dexter. It stars Nick Nolte, Chazz Palminteri, Melanie Griffith, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, Jennifer Connelly, Treat Williams, John Malkovich, Bruce Dern and Andrew McCarthy. Music is by Dave Grusin and cinematography by Haskell Wexler. 1950s Los Angeles and four unorthodox detectives led by Maxwell Hoover (Nolte) are called in to investigate the death of a young woman found crushed at a construction site. The woman is revealed to be an aspiring actress who had recently had a relationship with the married Hoover. Can is open, and worms everywhere, and following those worms leads Hoover down murky avenues... It's the almost nearly great neo-noir movie, everything looks right in principal, it has a strongly assembled cast, the 50s visuals and cinematography are splendid, and the murder mystery element of the plot - with some added sex, sizzle and nuclear shenanigans - looks promising on the page. Yet it never delivers on that promise of being something dark, to be a labyrinthine noir thriller beating a black heart. It starts of so well, based on the infamous "Hat Squad" we reasonably expect the story to expand upon the opening macho machinations of the four tough hombres in the hats, but instead away from Nolte's grizzled Hoover, the other three guys are merely dressed up props. Which means there's some good actors wasted, sadly. As the plot moves slowly forward the investigation and Hoover character axis becomes less interesting. Griffith came in for some critical grief for a lacklustre performance, but she's done no favours by the writers who fail to give her marriage to Hoover any substance. So when things go pear shaped and the characters of Mr and Mrs Hoover should explode on the screen, we really don't care having had no interest previously to hang our emotional being on. It all builds to what can best be described as a poor pay off, the resolution to the hinted at muddy mystery is hardly shocking, and the "big" face-off sequence between good and bad guys (or bad and bad if you prefer) is about as exciting as watching paint dry. It's not an awful movie, but it is a very disappointing one. A film where a bit more thought given by the producers could have yielded so much more. 5/10

    I've found that if I somehow leave the room for food or a break, the film probably isn't really very good. Good or better keep me glued. I never left my seat during Mulholland Falls and from the opening sequences with the four LA cops in hats riding up sunny 1950's Hollywood Hills in a big black convertible, I was hooked. Hooked especially by a galvanizing, snappy performance by Nick Nolte as Hoover, head of his squad of four, a man of action before words, a man who simmers and glares and loves with passion: it's a performance that somehow should have been given more attention at the time of the film's release, a cops and crime film which somehow didn't match the zeitgeist of its period, lost in the shuffle. Almost every noir mystery past 1949 is a retread of some sort (Chinatown being a major exception),but what makes Mulholland Falls work is not the plot but the heady collection of dedicated supporting actors whether Melanie Griffith as a quietly restrained wife of a cop, or Chazz Palminteri, the wry right hand partner who talks about his psychiatrist without hesitation. The mystery deals with corruption in high places, of course, and John Malkovich and Treat Williams are good supports for Nolte to play against--but it's Nolte's show from start to finish and his intensity nails it!

    Wanna be L.A. Confidential was surprisingly released the year before but everything that that film got right this one gets wrong. The sets and costumes are pristine, not a single crease or smudge, that's the problem with them, everything looks new-not lived in. The actors some like Nolte and Madsen who would seem to be ideal for the period are as at sea as the miscast actors like Andrew McCarthy, who gives a fussy unconvincing turn, all are stiff and give no sense of actually living in the time period, everything feels very staged. The main fault lies with the director who doesn't seem to have a real feeling for the material and just wants to create pretty pictures. Adequate but nothing more.

    This film looks fantastic and is chock-full of great actors(Nick Nolte, Melanie Griffith, Chris Penn, Bruce Dern, John Malkovich, Chazz Palminteri, and more). A low-brow Chinatown. The 'look' of this film, and Nick Nolte's performance are the only things that are even close to the level of that earlier, finer work. However, this is well worth a view - especially if you are looking for a throwback escape from all the new release trash that's out there today. Sidenote: Jennifer Connelly's breasts should be the standard of perfection. Some of the fine actors have to take a backseat because there are just so many involved here. Nolte, however, is the star of this show, and his performance is definitely noteworthy. It's Nick's performance, and Tomahori's attention to graphic detail that make this film above average. The plot is an atomic bomb. You'll like this if you liked: Black Dahlia, L.A. Confidential(note: this movie is nowhere near that level), Miller's Crossing and Basic Instinct. 64/100

    When I watched this film recently I thought that it must have been made by people trying to capitalize on the success of L.A. Confidential. It has the same look and it has nothing short of a phenomenal cast list. But it actually came out a year before L.A. Confidential. I suspect that the L.A. Confidential producers wee quaking in their boots after this attempted film noir bombed at the box office. But of course, L.A. Confidential turned out to be a great success and is remembered as one of the truly great modern film noirs, combining all of the best features of a great film, and getting that 40's and 50's feeling just right. About all the Mulholland Falls gets right is the 40's and 50's feeling. But the cast of the Hat Squad come off as almost comic book figures. They drive around town in a big convertible but their hats never even flicker, less blow off in the breeze, even when they are trying to outrace an Army jeep at a nuclear test site. Indoors, they take off their coats but never their hats. The pace of the movie is glacially slow. It's difficult to stay awake. The writing is sub-par and all too predictable. The two talented and beautiful women in the movie, Melanie Griffith and Jennifer Connelly are largely wasted with relatively little screen time. In one comical scene Connelly is slapped by her mobster boyfriend and barely flinches. She returns the slap and almost knocks the guy over. Aren't mobsters supposed to be able to hit better than that? Or at least take a slap from a girl? Parts of the plot are beyond ridiculous. At the nuclear test site, the Hat Squad takes off down a road marked restricted, shoots the padlock off a locked gate, and then acts surprised when the Army comes after them. And John Malkovich as an effete and intellectual Army general in a red smoking jacket is so out of place to be absurd. Continuity is also a shambles in this film. During the airplane fight, Treat Williams has one of the rip cords from a parachute tied around his neck as he is thrown to the floor of the plane in front of the door. The next shot is a close-up of him sitting on the floor and the cord is mysteriously gone. At the end of the film, the three surviving members of the Hat Squad place their hats on the coffin of their fallen comrade. Nick Nolte then proceeds to put on his hat (not the one on the coffin) as they walk away. Where did that hat come from? The film has its moments but its poor writing and incredibly slow pace waste a great cast that tries as best they can to overcome the deficiencies of a crummy plot.

    With all the names in this film you'd think it would be "can't miss" material. The setting, in some respect, is challenging: MF is going to be compared to CHINATOWN and LA CONFIDENTIAL. Those two classics have nothing to fear. What MF offers is nothing more than ridiculous. The introductory scene has our fabulous four murdering a supposed mobster, though the only evil we know of the victim is sarcasm. Bad move. We are soon instructed to love the characters as altruistic. A significant portion of the film is the fab four riding around in their car wherein we're supposed to be entertained by unfunny and distracting banter. The plot is relatively simple and just gets dumber and dumberer. The casting of Nick Nolte is a mistake: We need a less intimidating character. Melanie Griffen and Andrew McCarthy give great performances that are wasted. John Malkovich and Treat Williams go through the motions. The sets and costumes are great, but the film's actual stars are Jennifer Connelly's breasts, variously covered and uncovered. What a waste of time and money.

    A top drawer cast stars in "Mulholland Falls," a 1996 film starring Nick Nolte, Chazz Palmentieri, Melanie Griffith, Jennifer Connelly, Michael Madsen, Treat Williams, Bruce Dern, and John Malkovich, directed by New Zealand director Lee Tamahori. Sometimes when I don't know the year of a film, I try to guess. I placed this film in 1998 because I concluded it must have come after "L.A. Confidential" since it's about '50s crime investigation. Also, Jennifer Connelly is very young here - reminiscent of the way she looked in "Dark City." I was two years off. The story concerns the L.A. Hat Squad, led by Max Hoover (Nolte) called to investigate the brutal murder of Allison Pond (Jennifer Connelly). When her body is turned over, Hoover realizes it's an ex-girlfriend. He's never told his wife (Melanie Griffith) about the affair, stating that he had the affair, it ended, no one got hurt, and to tell her would hurt her deeply. The investigation of the murder leads to a general (John Malkovich), an atom bomb testing site, secret film footage, and military secrets. Very good performances from everyone - had Nolte been able to keep his life together, he could have been up there with the very greatest. He's always been capable of truly great performances, all the way back to the "Rich Man, Poor Man" days. Here one can feel his tremendous sadness and weariness. It's a pall that hangs over the entire film. Jennifer Connelly, whose part isn't very large, is gorgeous, sexy, and tough. Melanie Griffith gives a mature performance as Hoover's wife. Uncredited in the film are Rob Lowe and Louise Fletcher. There is a very exciting scene at the end of the movie. "Mulholland Falls" never received the attention that "L.A. Confidential" did. One can blame marketing, but the story isn't special enough, the characters not as well delineated, and the pace is a bit too leisurely. This isn't to say it's not a good film. It's just not exceptional. I applaud anyone who does a period noir that comes off like a noir and not a bad attempt. There, "Mullholland Falls" succeeds admirably.

    I quite like films like Mulholland Falls; films about shady, down-beat and supposedly emotionless American detectives searching for something dear as they do their best to hide the fact that it means that much to them. Films that are daft enough but enjoyable enough to have their leads be able to spot vital clues linked to the overall success of their goal whilst being in a state of near intoxication by way of hard alcohol. Nick Nolte's character does this towards the end of Mulholland Falls when watching a short, silent piece of moving image footage, but there you go. The film itself is a dank and involving noir inspired thriller from 1996 about corruption and murder amidst the higher-ups of the nation and one man's quest to uncover it; only, he doesn't know it at the time. The beauty of these stories is that they establish a hard-as-nails male lead whom keeps within his little pool of dishing out pain and retribution, effectively, before broadening them out into a wider scope of scum and dispute; the catch being that the negative characteristics on these outside of the pool are tougher to spot: they're still there, but they hide amidst this sea of expensive furniture, clothing and generally plush mise-en-scene. The film begins with two 8MM pieces of film footage that we feel we have no right to observe: some blast footage of an atomic weapon being tested and therefore detonated, exemplified when we sporadically cut to another film and an army official pushing the camera operator, ie; the audience, away from the general area; as well as another film in which a mounted camera is pointing at two people about to engage in sexual activity. Such is the tone the film will take, and such is the battle the lead has on him that in order to succeed in his mission, he'll need to break on through and confront things that certain others would rather you wouldn't see or realise were there. Corruption is a rife and pleasurable theme for classical film noir, or more contemporary noirs that pay homage; corruption usually equating to cheating, lying or deception and when the general ingredients are on the money; the piece ends up worth seeing. The film would have you think it's about four guys, police officers in 1950s Los Angeles, taking names and kicking their way around town, bullying those they deem guilty of whatever crime by tossing them down a hill just off Mulholland Drive. At least it might've been about that had it been set several years prior to events here. Here, Nolte's cop named Max Hoover gets in way over his head and finds himself on a road to all things dangerous when he and his crew come across a woman firmly embedded within the ground out in the open wilderness nearby a construction site. It looks like she's hit the ground from a great height, but everyone's puzzled as to how it might have happened. Further more, Hoover knows the girl from recent times. Hoover has a wife he struggles to truly connect with over the course of the film, she's young; attractive and enjoys reading Hemingway, but like most films about butch men working together for the greater-good; Mulholland Falls is more interested in a relationship between two males, that of Hoover and Chazz Palminteri's cop Elleroy Coolidge, a guy in that group of four which also consisted of Michael Madsen and Chris Penn  but loosing both of them would do the film no harm. The death of the young girl, a certain Allison Pond (Connelly), affects Hoover in ways that doesn't see him afraid to admit to, purely because he once upon a time had an affair with her, rendering the investigation somewhat personal rather than just strictly business. What do we come to learn of Palminteri's character? Well, we learn that it's not wise to back chat him just prior to taking a drink out of a glass full of something, but we also come to find of the issues he carries; someone whom it is revealed suffers from personal problems of his own and much to some of the other hard-nosed archetype cop's confusion; his issues and the exploration of them somewhat going against what it is that makes these archetypes in these sorts of films so recognisable. Coolidge's thoughts on the Western film genre, for one, is supposed to signify a broader sense of thinking away from all the hard-nosed work while his linking this to thoughts on the ramifications certain events have on future items display a meek sense of sensory awareness. It is no coincidence then that the two find a degree of solace with one another and it ought not be much of a surprise to see Coolidge connect with Hoover in the way they do; one coming to the other's aid and sharing the burden of the film's denouement together. The film eventually branches out into a feud between those within the world of the 'just', a sort of documentation of the birth of internal affairs, only not making out that that's what it is particularly evident; instead delivering dramatically rather than historically a tight enough narrative to do with corruption and 'the enemy within' linked to the F.B.I. and The U.S. Army. Yes, there are sequences that feel patched on; yes, we know exactly who'll survive and who won't survive certain gunfights half way through and yes, it really could do without two of its four leads of whom the film barely makes any attempt to really get the most out of the performers in question, but Mulholland Falls is a knowing if somewhat flimsy tale of a man's life coming apart as he confronts past mistakes and current ones on the state's behalf.

    This movie needed more Jennifer Connelly, and it needed to be in black and white. I'm sorry, but noir never really works for me unless it's steeped in shadows and a colorless world. That's just what I've been conditioned to expect from a good noir movie. If Mulholland Falls would have been set in the modern day, I think that the color wouldn't have bothered me as much, but the combination of the time period and the style makes the colorization just to much for me to tolerate. As for Jennifer, she's the crux of the film, but we don't get to spend very much time at all with her. We don't get a sense of who she is and why she did the things that she did, and that greatly lessens the impact of her death. If you don't care about the core of the story, then it's difficult to have any real investment in the rest of the movie. In all honesty, even if the movie was in black and white and Jennifer Connelly had two times more scenes, this movie would probably still be boring. I just never cared or was interested in what was going on. Michael Madsen was wasted, there wasn't nearly enough of John Malkovich, and Nick Nolte was just smacking people and looking grim. Mulholland Falls gets two stars for Jennifer Connelly's magnificence, but even her wonders barely made it worth watching.

    "Mulholland Falls" is a murder mystery which, at the time of its release, failed to achieve a very positive response from either the critics or the public. This is unfortunate because it does have a number of qualities which make it both entertaining and praiseworthy and its evocation of the period in which it's set (the early 1950s) is both visually impressive and atmospheric. Director Lee Tamahori and cinematographer Haskell Wexler deserve credit for this as does Dave Grusin who was responsible for the marvellous original score. In typical film noir style, the main protagonist (in this case a police detective) finds himself in a situation in which he's out of his depth and then finds that further developments just continue to make things worse as he follows a route which seems destined to take him into a state of being both morally and emotionally impoverished. Max Hoover (Nick Nolte) is the leader of a squad of four LAPD detectives whose job is to get rid of gangsters and criminals and they do this very effectively. Their modus operandi is to dispense justice in a very brutal and unorthodox manner and they're able to do this with impunity because they have the support of their Chief of Police (Bruce Dern). When a woman's dead body is found at a construction site and the squad investigate, it soon emerges that she was Allison Pond (Jennifer Connelly). Pond was an aspiring actress and Hoover is shaken by what he finds because he'd previously had a six month affair with her before deciding to end the relationship. Shortly after, a film is discovered which shows Pond having sex with a man who turns out to be General Thomas Timms (John Malkovich). Timms is the head of the Atomic Energy Commission and when the squad continue their investigation they soon come up against hostility and threats from Colonel Fitzgerald (Treat Williams) and FBI Agent McCafferty (Daniel Baldwin) before discovering the existence of a conspiracy to conceal the activities of personnel at a military base where atomic bomb tests had been carried out. The anguish that Hoover experiences during this case is worsened when a film showing one of his encounters with Allison Pond comes into the possession of his wife Katherine (Melanie Griffith). Although he'd eventually finished his affair with Pond because he'd cared more for his wife, the pain of discovering his infidelity is no less intense for Katherine who is totally heartbroken.

The picture of the four of them standing on the edge of a bomb crater is also particularly striking. The closest relationship within the squad is between Hoover and Coolidge and in a significant departure from the otherwise macho ethos of the group, Coolidge is not only undergoing a course of counselling to deal with his temper and food issues but has also completely bought into the benefits of psychotherapy. When Hoover is worried about Katherine finding out about his affair, Coolidge suggests talking the matter through to reach a solution. This suggestion doesn't sit well with Hoover who sees it as an abdication of personal responsibility because taking Coolidge's advice would lead to two people being distressed by his actions instead of one.

    Wanna be L.A. Confidential was surprisingly released the year before but everything that that film got right this one gets wrong. The sets and costumes are pristine, not a single crease or smudge, that's the problem with them, everything looks new-not lived in. The actors some like Nolte and Madsen who would seem to be ideal for the period are as at sea as the miscast actors like Andrew McCarthy, who gives a fussy unconvincing turn, all are stiff and give no sense of actually living in the time period, everything feels very staged. The main fault lies with the director who doesn't seem to have a real feeling for the material and just wants to create pretty pictures. Adequate but nothing more.

    This film looks fantastic and is chock-full of great actors(Nick Nolte, Melanie Griffith, Chris Penn, Bruce Dern, John Malkovich, Chazz Palminteri, and more). A low-brow Chinatown. The 'look' of this film, and Nick Nolte's performance are the only things that are even close to the level of that earlier, finer work. However, this is well worth a view - especially if you are looking for a throwback escape from all the new release trash that's out there today. Sidenote: Jennifer Connelly's breasts should be the standard of perfection. Some of the fine actors have to take a backseat because there are just so many involved here. Nolte, however, is the star of this show, and his performance is definitely noteworthy. It's Nick's performance, and Tomahori's attention to graphic detail that make this film above average. The plot is an atomic bomb. You'll like this if you liked: Black Dahlia, L.A. Confidential(note: this movie is nowhere near that level), Miller's Crossing and Basic Instinct. 64/100

    When I watched this film recently I thought that it must have been made by people trying to capitalize on the success of L.A. Confidential. It has the same look and it has nothing short of a phenomenal cast list. But it actually came out a year before L.A. Confidential. I suspect that the L.A. Confidential producers wee quaking in their boots after this attempted film noir bombed at the box office. But of course, L.A. Confidential turned out to be a great success and is remembered as one of the truly great modern film noirs, combining all of the best features of a great film, and getting that 40's and 50's feeling just right. About all the Mulholland Falls gets right is the 40's and 50's feeling. But the cast of the Hat Squad come off as almost comic book figures. They drive around town in a big convertible but their hats never even flicker, less blow off in the breeze, even when they are trying to outrace an Army jeep at a nuclear test site. Indoors, they take off their coats but never their hats. The pace of the movie is glacially slow. It's difficult to stay awake. The writing is sub-par and all too predictable. The two talented and beautiful women in the movie, Melanie Griffith and Jennifer Connelly are largely wasted with relatively little screen time. In one comical scene Connelly is slapped by her mobster boyfriend and barely flinches. She returns the slap and almost knocks the guy over. Aren't mobsters supposed to be able to hit better than that? Or at least take a slap from a girl? Parts of the plot are beyond ridiculous. At the nuclear test site, the Hat Squad takes off down a road marked restricted, shoots the padlock off a locked gate, and then acts surprised when the Army comes after them. And John Malkovich as an effete and intellectual Army general in a red smoking jacket is so out of place to be absurd. Continuity is also a shambles in this film. During the airplane fight, Treat Williams has one of the rip cords from a parachute tied around his neck as he is thrown to the floor of the plane in front of the door. The next shot is a close-up of him sitting on the floor and the cord is mysteriously gone. At the end of the film, the three surviving members of the Hat Squad place their hats on the coffin of their fallen comrade. Nick Nolte then proceeds to put on his hat (not the one on the coffin) as they walk away. Where did that hat come from? The film has its moments but its poor writing and incredibly slow pace waste a great cast that tries as best they can to overcome the deficiencies of a crummy plot.

    With all the names in this film you'd think it would be "can't miss" material. The setting, in some respect, is challenging: MF is going to be compared to CHINATOWN and LA CONFIDENTIAL. Those two classics have nothing to fear. What MF offers is nothing more than ridiculous. The introductory scene has our fabulous four murdering a supposed mobster, though the only evil we know of the victim is sarcasm. Bad move. We are soon instructed to love the characters as altruistic. A significant portion of the film is the fab four riding around in their car wherein we're supposed to be entertained by unfunny and distracting banter. The plot is relatively simple and just gets dumber and dumberer. The casting of Nick Nolte is a mistake: We need a less intimidating character. Melanie Griffen and Andrew McCarthy give great performances that are wasted. John Malkovich and Treat Williams go through the motions. The sets and costumes are great, but the film's actual stars are Jennifer Connelly's breasts, variously covered and uncovered. What a waste of time and money.

    A top drawer cast stars in "Mulholland Falls," a 1996 film starring Nick Nolte, Chazz Palmentieri, Melanie Griffith, Jennifer Connelly, Michael Madsen, Treat Williams, Bruce Dern, and John Malkovich, directed by New Zealand director Lee Tamahori. Sometimes when I don't know the year of a film, I try to guess. I placed this film in 1998 because I concluded it must have come after "L.A. Confidential" since it's about '50s crime investigation. Also, Jennifer Connelly is very young here - reminiscent of the way she looked in "Dark City." I was two years off. The story concerns the L.A. Hat Squad, led by Max Hoover (Nolte) called to investigate the brutal murder of Allison Pond (Jennifer Connelly). When her body is turned over, Hoover realizes it's an ex-girlfriend. He's never told his wife (Melanie Griffith) about the affair, stating that he had the affair, it ended, no one got hurt, and to tell her would hurt her deeply. The investigation of the murder leads to a general (John Malkovich), an atom bomb testing site, secret film footage, and military secrets. Very good performances from everyone - had Nolte been able to keep his life together, he could have been up there with the very greatest. He's always been capable of truly great performances, all the way back to the "Rich Man, Poor Man" days. Here one can feel his tremendous sadness and weariness. It's a pall that hangs over the entire film. Jennifer Connelly, whose part isn't very large, is gorgeous, sexy, and tough. Melanie Griffith gives a mature performance as Hoover's wife. Uncredited in the film are Rob Lowe and Louise Fletcher. There is a very exciting scene at the end of the movie. "Mulholland Falls" never received the attention that "L.A. Confidential" did. One can blame marketing, but the story isn't special enough, the characters not as well delineated, and the pace is a bit too leisurely. This isn't to say it's not a good film. It's just not exceptional. I applaud anyone who does a period noir that comes off like a noir and not a bad attempt. There, "Mullholland Falls" succeeds admirably.

    By the numbers but engaging thriller with an eye on noir of old, Mulholland Falls is a sporadically interesting film about a man facing his past and confronting the present.

    I quite like films like Mulholland Falls; films about shady, down-beat and supposedly emotionless American detectives searching for something dear as they do their best to hide the fact that it means that much to them. Films that are daft enough but enjoyable enough to have their leads be able to spot vital clues linked to the overall success of their goal whilst being in a state of near intoxication by way of hard alcohol. Nick Nolte's character does this towards the end of Mulholland Falls when watching a short, silent piece of moving image footage, but there you go. The film itself is a dank and involving noir inspired thriller from 1996 about corruption and murder amidst the higher-ups of the nation and one man's quest to uncover it; only, he doesn't know it at the time. The beauty of these stories is that they establish a hard-as-nails male lead whom keeps within his little pool of dishing out pain and retribution, effectively, before broadening them out into a wider scope of scum and dispute; the catch being that the negative characteristics on these outside of the pool are tougher to spot: they're still there, but they hide amidst this sea of expensive furniture, clothing and generally plush mise-en-scene. The film begins with two 8MM pieces of film footage that we feel we have no right to observe: some blast footage of an atomic weapon being tested and therefore detonated, exemplified when we sporadically cut to another film and an army official pushing the camera operator, ie; the audience, away from the general area; as well as another film in which a mounted camera is pointing at two people about to engage in sexual activity. Such is the tone the film will take, and such is the battle the lead has on him that in order to succeed in his mission, he'll need to break on through and confront things that certain others would rather you wouldn't see or realise were there. Corruption is a rife and pleasurable theme for classical film noir, or more contemporary noirs that pay homage; corruption usually equating to cheating, lying or deception and when the general ingredients are on the money; the piece ends up worth seeing. The film would have you think it's about four guys, police officers in 1950s Los Angeles, taking names and kicking their way around town, bullying those they deem guilty of whatever crime by tossing them down a hill just off Mulholland Drive. At least it might've been about that had it been set several years prior to events here. Here, Nolte's cop named Max Hoover gets in way over his head and finds himself on a road to all things dangerous when he and his crew come across a woman firmly embedded within the ground out in the open wilderness nearby a construction site. It looks like she's hit the ground from a great height, but everyone's puzzled as to how it might have happened. Further more, Hoover knows the girl from recent times. Hoover has a wife he struggles to truly connect with over the course of the film, she's young; attractive and enjoys reading Hemingway, but like most films about butch men working together for the greater-good; Mulholland Falls is more interested in a relationship between two males, that of Hoover and Chazz Palminteri's cop Elleroy Coolidge, a guy in that group of four which also consisted of Michael Madsen and Chris Penn  but loosing both of them would do the film no harm. The death of the young girl, a certain Allison Pond (Connelly), affects Hoover in ways that doesn't see him afraid to admit to, purely because he once upon a time had an affair with her, rendering the investigation somewhat personal rather than just strictly business. What do we come to learn of Palminteri's character? Well, we learn that it's not wise to back chat him just prior to taking a drink out of a glass full of something, but we also come to find of the issues he carries; someone whom it is revealed suffers from personal problems of his own and much to some of the other hard-nosed archetype cop's confusion; his issues and the exploration of them somewhat going against what it is that makes these archetypes in these sorts of films so recognisable. Coolidge's thoughts on the Western film genre, for one, is supposed to signify a broader sense of thinking away from all the hard-nosed work while his linking this to thoughts on the ramifications certain events have on future items display a meek sense of sensory awareness. It is no coincidence then that the two find a degree of solace with one another and it ought not be much of a surprise to see Coolidge connect with Hoover in the way they do; one coming to the other's aid and sharing the burden of the film's denouement together. The film eventually branches out into a feud between those within the world of the 'just', a sort of documentation of the birth of internal affairs, only not making out that that's what it is particularly evident; instead delivering dramatically rather than historically a tight enough narrative to do with corruption and 'the enemy within' linked to the F.B.I. and The U.S. Army. Yes, there are sequences that feel patched on; yes, we know exactly who'll survive and who won't survive certain gunfights half way through and yes, it really could do without two of its four leads of whom the film barely makes any attempt to really get the most out of the performers in question, but Mulholland Falls is a knowing if somewhat flimsy tale of a man's life coming apart as he confronts past mistakes and current ones on the state's behalf.

    This movie needed more Jennifer Connelly, and it needed to be in black and white. I'm sorry, but noir never really works for me unless it's steeped in shadows and a colorless world. That's just what I've been conditioned to expect from a good noir movie. If Mulholland Falls would have been set in the modern day, I think that the color wouldn't have bothered me as much, but the combination of the time period and the style makes the colorization just to much for me to tolerate. As for Jennifer, she's the crux of the film, but we don't get to spend very much time at all with her. We don't get a sense of who she is and why she did the things that she did, and that greatly lessens the impact of her death. If you don't care about the core of the story, then it's difficult to have any real investment in the rest of the movie. In all honesty, even if the movie was in black and white and Jennifer Connelly had two times more scenes, this movie would probably still be boring. I just never cared or was interested in what was going on. Michael Madsen was wasted, there wasn't nearly enough of John Malkovich, and Nick Nolte was just smacking people and looking grim. Mulholland Falls gets two stars for Jennifer Connelly's magnificence, but even her wonders barely made it worth watching.

    "Mulholland Falls" is a murder mystery which, at the time of its release, failed to achieve a very positive response from either the critics or the public. This is unfortunate because it does have a number of qualities which make it both entertaining and praiseworthy and its evocation of the period in which it's set (the early 1950s) is both visually impressive and atmospheric. Director Lee Tamahori and cinematographer Haskell Wexler deserve credit for this as does Dave Grusin who was responsible for the marvellous original score. In typical film noir style, the main protagonist (in this case a police detective) finds himself in a situation in which he's out of his depth and then finds that further developments just continue to make things worse as he follows a route which seems destined to take him into a state of being both morally and emotionally impoverished. Max Hoover (Nick Nolte) is the leader of a squad of four LAPD detectives whose job is to get rid of gangsters and criminals and they do this very effectively. Their modus operandi is to dispense justice in a very brutal and unorthodox manner and they're able to do this with impunity because they have the support of their Chief of Police (Bruce Dern). When a woman's dead body is found at a construction site and the squad investigate, it soon emerges that she was Allison Pond (Jennifer Connelly). Pond was an aspiring actress and Hoover is shaken by what he finds because he'd previously had a six month affair with her before deciding to end the relationship. Shortly after, a film is discovered which shows Pond having sex with a man who turns out to be General Thomas Timms (John Malkovich). Timms is the head of the Atomic Energy Commission and when the squad continue their investigation they soon come up against hostility and threats from Colonel Fitzgerald (Treat Williams) and FBI Agent McCafferty (Daniel Baldwin) before discovering the existence of a conspiracy to conceal the activities of personnel at a military base where atomic bomb tests had been carried out. The anguish that Hoover experiences during this case is worsened when a film showing one of his encounters with Allison Pond comes into the possession of his wife Katherine (Melanie Griffith). Although he'd eventually finished his affair with Pond because he'd cared more for his wife, the pain of discovering his infidelity is no less intense for Katherine who is totally heartbroken. The reason why Pond was murdered is gradually revealed and Hoover and his partner Ellery Coolidge (Chazz Palminteri) have to engage in a frantic fight for their lives before the story comes to its sombre conclusion. Hoover's squad, which also comprises Coolidge, Eddie Hall (Michael Madsen) and Arthur Relyea (Chris Penn) is great fun to watch as its members swagger around in stylish suits or cruise around in a Buick convertible. The picture of the four of them standing on the edge of a bomb crater is also particularly striking. The closest relationship within the squad is between Hoover and Coolidge and in a significant departure from the otherwise macho ethos of the group, Coolidge is not only undergoing a course of counselling to deal with his temper and food issues but has also completely bought into the benefits of psychotherapy. When Hoover is worried about Katherine finding out about his affair, Coolidge suggests talking the matter through to reach a solution. This suggestion doesn't sit well with Hoover who sees it as an abdication of personal responsibility because taking Coolidge's advice would lead to two people being distressed by his actions instead of one. Also in one of the movie's most memorable lines, he underscores the philosophical difference between them when he says "here's something that doesn't cost you 25 bucks an hour.....you carry your own water Ellery......you understand? You carry your own water". "Mulholland Falls" boasts a star studded cast and some superb performances. Nolte is perfect in his role as someone who's tough, hard drinking, guilt ridden and given to outbursts of uncontrollable rage. John Malkovich excels as the eccentric Timms who says that "some people must die before their time so that others can live. It's a cornerstone of civilisation". Madsen and Penn are excellent in their support roles and Jennifer Conelly and Melanie Griffith both make a strong impression as women who unjustly experience very cruel treatment. There are also a number of great cameos to look out for from Andrew McCarthy, Louise Fletcher, Bruce Dern and Rob Lowe and even an exquisite rendition of "Harbour Lights" by Aaron Neville.

    Mulholland Falls is directed by Lee Tamahori and written by Pete Dexter. It stars Nick Nolte, Chazz Palminteri, Melanie Griffith, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, Jennifer Connelly, Treat Williams, John Malkovich, Bruce Dern and Andrew McCarthy. Music is by Dave Grusin and cinematography by Haskell Wexler. 1950s Los Angeles and four unorthodox detectives led by Maxwell Hoover (Nolte) are called in to investigate the death of a young woman found crushed at a construction site. The woman is revealed to be an aspiring actress who had recently had a relationship with the married Hoover. Can is open, and worms everywhere, and following those worms leads Hoover down murky avenues... It's the almost nearly great neo-noir movie, everything looks right in principal, it has a strongly assembled cast, the 50s visuals and cinematography are splendid, and the murder mystery element of the plot - with some added sex, sizzle and nuclear shenanigans - looks promising on the page. Yet it never delivers on that promise of being something dark, to be a labyrinthine noir thriller beating a black heart. It starts of so well, based on the infamous "Hat Squad" we reasonably expect the story to expand upon the opening macho machinations of the four tough hombres in the hats, but instead away from Nolte's grizzled Hoover, the other three guys are merely dressed up props. Which means there's some good actors wasted, sadly. As the plot moves slowly forward the investigation and Hoover character axis becomes less interesting. Griffith came in for some critical grief for a lacklustre performance, but she's done no favours by the writers who fail to give her marriage to Hoover any substance. So when things go pear shaped and the characters of Mr and Mrs Hoover should explode on the screen, we really don't care having had no interest previously to hang our emotional being on. It all builds to what can best be described as a poor pay off, the resolution to the hinted at muddy mystery is hardly shocking, and the "big" face-off sequence between good and bad guys (or bad and bad if you prefer) is about as exciting as watching paint dry. It's not an awful movie, but it is a very disappointing one. A film where a bit more thought given by the producers could have yielded so much more. 5/10

    I've found that if I somehow leave the room for food or a break, the film probably isn't really very good. Good or better keep me glued. I never left my seat during Mulholland Falls and from the opening sequences with the four LA cops in hats riding up sunny 1950's Hollywood Hills in a big black convertible, I was hooked. Hooked especially by a galvanizing, snappy performance by Nick Nolte as Hoover, head of his squad of four, a man of action before words, a man who simmers and glares and loves with passion: it's a performance that somehow should have been given more attention at the time of the film's release, a cops and crime film which somehow didn't match the zeitgeist of its period, lost in the shuffle. Almost every noir mystery past 1949 is a retread of some sort (Chinatown being a major exception),but what makes Mulholland Falls work is not the plot but the heady collection of dedicated supporting actors whether Melanie Griffith as a quietly restrained wife of a cop, or Chazz Palminteri, the wry right hand partner who talks about his psychiatrist without hesitation. The mystery deals with corruption in high places, of course, and John Malkovich and Treat Williams are good supports for Nolte to play against--but it's Nolte's show from start to finish and his intensity nails it!

The investigation of the murder leads to a general (John Malkovich), an atom bomb testing site, secret film footage, and military secrets. Very good performances from everyone - had Nolte been able to keep his life together, he could have been up there with the very greatest. He's always been capable of truly great performances, all the way back to the "Rich Man, Poor Man" days. Here one can feel his tremendous sadness and weariness. It's a pall that hangs over the entire film. Jennifer Connelly, whose part isn't very large, is gorgeous, sexy, and tough. Melanie Griffith gives a mature performance as Hoover's wife. Uncredited in the film are Rob Lowe and Louise Fletcher. There is a very exciting scene at the end of the movie. "Mulholland Falls" never received the attention that "L.A. Confidential" did. One can blame marketing, but the story isn't special enough, the characters not as well delineated, and the pace is a bit too leisurely. This isn't to say it's not a good film. It's just not exceptional. I applaud anyone who does a period noir that comes off like a noir and not a bad attempt. There, "Mullholland Falls" succeeds admirably.

    I quite like films like Mulholland Falls; films about shady, down-beat and supposedly emotionless American detectives searching for something dear as they do their best to hide the fact that it means that much to them. Films that are daft enough but enjoyable enough to have their leads be able to spot vital clues linked to the overall success of their goal whilst being in a state of near intoxication by way of hard alcohol. Nick Nolte's character does this towards the end of Mulholland Falls when watching a short, silent piece of moving image footage, but there you go. The film itself is a dank and involving noir inspired thriller from 1996 about corruption and murder amidst the higher-ups of the nation and one man's quest to uncover it; only, he doesn't know it at the time. The beauty of these stories is that they establish a hard-as-nails male lead whom keeps within his little pool of dishing out pain and retribution, effectively, before broadening them out into a wider scope of scum and dispute; the catch being that the negative characteristics on these outside of the pool are tougher to spot: they're still there, but they hide amidst this sea of expensive furniture, clothing and generally plush mise-en-scene. The film begins with two 8MM pieces of film footage that we feel we have no right to observe: some blast footage of an atomic weapon being tested and therefore detonated, exemplified when we sporadically cut to another film and an army official pushing the camera operator, ie; the audience, away from the general area; as well as another film in which a mounted camera is pointing at two people about to engage in sexual activity. Such is the tone the film will take, and such is the battle the lead has on him that in order to succeed in his mission, he'll need to break on through and confront things that certain others would rather you wouldn't see or realise were there. Corruption is a rife and pleasurable theme for classical film noir, or more contemporary noirs that pay homage; corruption usually equating to cheating, lying or deception and when the general ingredients are on the money; the piece ends up worth seeing. The film would have you think it's about four guys, police officers in 1950s Los Angeles, taking names and kicking their way around town, bullying those they deem guilty of whatever crime by tossing them down a hill just off Mulholland Drive. At least it might've been about that had it been set several years prior to events here. Here, Nolte's cop named Max Hoover gets in way over his head and finds himself on a road to all things dangerous when he and his crew come across a woman firmly embedded within the ground out in the open wilderness nearby a construction site. It looks like she's hit the ground from a great height, but everyone's puzzled as to how it might have happened. Further more, Hoover knows the girl from recent times. Hoover has a wife he struggles to truly connect with over the course of the film, she's young; attractive and enjoys reading Hemingway, but like most films about butch men working together for the greater-good; Mulholland Falls is more interested in a relationship between two males, that of Hoover and Chazz Palminteri's cop Elleroy Coolidge, a guy in that group of four which also consisted of Michael Madsen and Chris Penn  but loosing both of them would do the film no harm. The death of the young girl, a certain Allison Pond (Connelly), affects Hoover in ways that doesn't see him afraid to admit to, purely because he once upon a time had an affair with her, rendering the investigation somewhat personal rather than just strictly business. What do we come to learn of Palminteri's character? Well, we learn that it's not wise to back chat him just prior to taking a drink out of a glass full of something, but we also come to find of the issues he carries; someone whom it is revealed suffers from personal problems of his own and much to some of the other hard-nosed archetype cop's confusion; his issues and the exploration of them somewhat going against what it is that makes these archetypes in these sorts of films so recognisable. Coolidge's thoughts on the Western film genre, for one, is supposed to signify a broader sense of thinking away from all the hard-nosed work while his linking this to thoughts on the ramifications certain events have on future items display a meek sense of sensory awareness. It is no coincidence then that the two find a degree of solace with one another and it ought not be much of a surprise to see Coolidge connect with Hoover in the way they do; one coming to the other's aid and sharing the burden of the film's denouement together. The film eventually branches out into a feud between those within the world of the 'just', a sort of documentation of the birth of internal affairs, only not making out that that's what it is particularly evident; instead delivering dramatically rather than historically a tight enough narrative to do with corruption and 'the enemy within' linked to the F.B.I. and The U.S. Army. Yes, there are sequences that feel patched on; yes, we know exactly who'll survive and who won't survive certain gunfights half way through and yes, it really could do without two of its four leads of whom the film barely makes any attempt to really get the most out of the performers in question, but Mulholland Falls is a knowing if somewhat flimsy tale of a man's life coming apart as he confronts past mistakes and current ones on the state's behalf.

    This movie needed more Jennifer Connelly, and it needed to be in black and white. I'm sorry, but noir never really works for me unless it's steeped in shadows and a colorless world. That's just what I've been conditioned to expect from a good noir movie. If Mulholland Falls would have been set in the modern day, I think that the color wouldn't have bothered me as much, but the combination of the time period and the style makes the colorization just to much for me to tolerate. As for Jennifer, she's the crux of the film, but we don't get to spend very much time at all with her. We don't get a sense of who she is and why she did the things that she did, and that greatly lessens the impact of her death. If you don't care about the core of the story, then it's difficult to have any real investment in the rest of the movie. In all honesty, even if the movie was in black and white and Jennifer Connelly had two times more scenes, this movie would probably still be boring. I just never cared or was interested in what was going on. Michael Madsen was wasted, there wasn't nearly enough of John Malkovich, and Nick Nolte was just smacking people and looking grim. Mulholland Falls gets two stars for Jennifer Connelly's magnificence, but even her wonders barely made it worth watching.

    "Mulholland Falls" is a murder mystery which, at the time of its release, failed to achieve a very positive response from either the critics or the public. This is unfortunate because it does have a number of qualities which make it both entertaining and praiseworthy and its evocation of the period in which it's set (the early 1950s) is both visually impressive and atmospheric. Director Lee Tamahori and cinematographer Haskell Wexler deserve credit for this as does Dave Grusin who was responsible for the marvellous original score. In typical film noir style, the main protagonist (in this case a police detective) finds himself in a situation in which he's out of his depth and then finds that further developments just continue to make things worse as he follows a route which seems destined to take him into a state of being both morally and emotionally impoverished. Max Hoover (Nick Nolte) is the leader of a squad of four LAPD detectives whose job is to get rid of gangsters and criminals and they do this very effectively. Their modus operandi is to dispense justice in a very brutal and unorthodox manner and they're able to do this with impunity because they have the support of their Chief of Police (Bruce Dern). When a woman's dead body is found at a construction site and the squad investigate, it soon emerges that she was Allison Pond (Jennifer Connelly). Pond was an aspiring actress and Hoover is shaken by what he finds because he'd previously had a six month affair with her before deciding to end the relationship. Shortly after, a film is discovered which shows Pond having sex with a man who turns out to be General Thomas Timms (John Malkovich). Timms is the head of the Atomic Energy Commission and when the squad continue their investigation they soon come up against hostility and threats from Colonel Fitzgerald (Treat Williams) and FBI Agent McCafferty (Daniel Baldwin) before discovering the existence of a conspiracy to conceal the activities of personnel at a military base where atomic bomb tests had been carried out. The anguish that Hoover experiences during this case is worsened when a film showing one of his encounters with Allison Pond comes into the possession of his wife Katherine (Melanie Griffith). Although he'd eventually finished his affair with Pond because he'd cared more for his wife, the pain of discovering his infidelity is no less intense for Katherine who is totally heartbroken. The reason why Pond was murdered is gradually revealed and Hoover and his partner Ellery Coolidge (Chazz Palminteri) have to engage in a frantic fight for their lives before the story comes to its sombre conclusion. Hoover's squad, which also comprises Coolidge, Eddie Hall (Michael Madsen) and Arthur Relyea (Chris Penn) is great fun to watch as its members swagger around in stylish suits or cruise around in a Buick convertible. The picture of the four of them standing on the edge of a bomb crater is also particularly striking. The closest relationship within the squad is between Hoover and Coolidge and in a significant departure from the otherwise macho ethos of the group, Coolidge is not only undergoing a course of counselling to deal with his temper and food issues but has also completely bought into the benefits of psychotherapy. When Hoover is worried about Katherine finding out about his affair, Coolidge suggests talking the matter through to reach a solution. This suggestion doesn't sit well with Hoover who sees it as an abdication of personal responsibility because taking Coolidge's advice would lead to two people being distressed by his actions instead of one. Also in one of the movie's most memorable lines, he underscores the philosophical difference between them when he says "here's something that doesn't cost you 25 bucks an hour.....you carry your own water Ellery......you understand? You carry your own water". "Mulholland Falls" boasts a star studded cast and some superb performances. Nolte is perfect in his role as someone who's tough, hard drinking, guilt ridden and given to outbursts of uncontrollable rage. John Malkovich excels as the eccentric Timms who says that "some people must die before their time so that others can live. It's a cornerstone of civilisation". Madsen and Penn are excellent in their support roles and Jennifer Conelly and Melanie Griffith both make a strong impression as women who unjustly experience very cruel treatment. There are also a number of great cameos to look out for from Andrew McCarthy, Louise Fletcher, Bruce Dern and Rob Lowe and even an exquisite rendition of "Harbour Lights" by Aaron Neville.

    Mulholland Falls is directed by Lee Tamahori and written by Pete Dexter. It stars Nick Nolte, Chazz Palminteri, Melanie Griffith, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, Jennifer Connelly, Treat Williams, John Malkovich, Bruce Dern and Andrew McCarthy. Music is by Dave Grusin and cinematography by Haskell Wexler. 1950s Los Angeles and four unorthodox detectives led by Maxwell Hoover (Nolte) are called in to investigate the death of a young woman found crushed at a construction site. The woman is revealed to be an aspiring actress who had recently had a relationship with the married Hoover. Can is open, and worms everywhere, and following those worms leads Hoover down murky avenues... It's the almost nearly great neo-noir movie, everything looks right in principal, it has a strongly assembled cast, the 50s visuals and cinematography are splendid, and the murder mystery element of the plot - with some added sex, sizzle and nuclear shenanigans - looks promising on the page. Yet it never delivers on that promise of being something dark, to be a labyrinthine noir thriller beating a black heart. It starts of so well, based on the infamous "Hat Squad" we reasonably expect the story to expand upon the opening macho machinations of the four tough hombres in the hats, but instead away from Nolte's grizzled Hoover, the other three guys are merely dressed up props. Which means there's some good actors wasted, sadly. As the plot moves slowly forward the investigation and Hoover character axis becomes less interesting. Griffith came in for some critical grief for a lacklustre performance, but she's done no favours by the writers who fail to give her marriage to Hoover any substance. So when things go pear shaped and the characters of Mr and Mrs Hoover should explode on the screen, we really don't care having had no interest previously to hang our emotional being on. It all builds to what can best be described as a poor pay off, the resolution to the hinted at muddy mystery is hardly shocking, and the "big" face-off sequence between good and bad guys (or bad and bad if you prefer) is about as exciting as watching paint dry. It's not an awful movie, but it is a very disappointing one. A film where a bit more thought given by the producers could have yielded so much more. 5/10

    I've found that if I somehow leave the room for food or a break, the film probably isn't really very good. Good or better keep me glued. I never left my seat during Mulholland Falls and from the opening sequences with the four LA cops in hats riding up sunny 1950's Hollywood Hills in a big black convertible, I was hooked. Hooked especially by a galvanizing, snappy performance by Nick Nolte as Hoover, head of his squad of four, a man of action before words, a man who simmers and glares and loves with passion: it's a performance that somehow should have been given more attention at the time of the film's release, a cops and crime film which somehow didn't match the zeitgeist of its period, lost in the shuffle. Almost every noir mystery past 1949 is a retread of some sort (Chinatown being a major exception),but what makes Mulholland Falls work is not the plot but the heady collection of dedicated supporting actors whether Melanie Griffith as a quietly restrained wife of a cop, or Chazz Palminteri, the wry right hand partner who talks about his psychiatrist without hesitation. The mystery deals with corruption in high places, of course, and John Malkovich and Treat Williams are good supports for Nolte to play against--but it's Nolte's show from start to finish and his intensity nails it!

    Wanna be L.A. Confidential was surprisingly released the year before but everything that that film got right this one gets wrong. The sets and costumes are pristine, not a single crease or smudge, that's the problem with them, everything looks new-not lived in. The actors some like Nolte and Madsen who would seem to be ideal for the period are as at sea as the miscast actors like Andrew McCarthy, who gives a fussy unconvincing turn, all are stiff and give no sense of actually living in the time period, everything feels very staged. The main fault lies with the director who doesn't seem to have a real feeling for the material and just wants to create pretty pictures. Adequate but nothing more.

    This film looks fantastic and is chock-full of great actors(Nick Nolte, Melanie Griffith, Chris Penn, Bruce Dern, John Malkovich, Chazz Palminteri, and more). A low-brow Chinatown. The 'look' of this film, and Nick Nolte's performance are the only things that are even close to the level of that earlier, finer work. However, this is well worth a view - especially if you are looking for a throwback escape from all the new release trash that's out there today. Sidenote: Jennifer Connelly's breasts should be the standard of perfection. Some of the fine actors have to take a backseat because there are just so many involved here. Nolte, however, is the star of this show, and his performance is definitely noteworthy. It's Nick's performance, and Tomahori's attention to graphic detail that make this film above average. The plot is an atomic bomb. You'll like this if you liked: Black Dahlia, L.A. Confidential(note: this movie is nowhere near that level), Miller's Crossing and Basic Instinct. 64/100

    When I watched this film recently I thought that it must have been made by people trying to capitalize on the success of L.A. Confidential. It has the same look and it has nothing short of a phenomenal cast list. But it actually came out a year before L.A. Confidential. I suspect that the L.A. Confidential producers wee quaking in their boots after this attempted film noir bombed at the box office. But of course, L.A. Confidential turned out to be a great success and is remembered as one of the truly great modern film noirs, combining all of the best features of a great film, and getting that 40's and 50's feeling just right. About all the Mulholland Falls gets right is the 40's and 50's feeling. But the cast of the Hat Squad come off as almost comic book figures. They drive around town in a big convertible but their hats never even flicker, less blow off in the breeze, even when they are trying to outrace an Army jeep at a nuclear test site. Indoors, they take off their coats but never their hats. The pace of the movie is glacially slow. It's difficult to stay awake. The writing is sub-par and all too predictable. The two talented and beautiful women in the movie, Melanie Griffith and Jennifer Connelly are largely wasted with relatively little screen time. In one comical scene Connelly is slapped by her mobster boyfriend and barely flinches. She returns the slap and almost knocks the guy over. Aren't mobsters supposed to be able to hit better than that? Or at least take a slap from a girl? Parts of the plot are beyond ridiculous. At the nuclear test site, the Hat Squad takes off down a road marked restricted, shoots the padlock off a locked gate, and then acts surprised when the Army comes after them. And John Malkovich as an effete and intellectual Army general in a red smoking jacket is so out of place to be absurd. Continuity is also a shambles in this film. During the airplane fight, Treat Williams has one of the rip cords from a parachute tied around his neck as he is thrown to the floor of the plane in front of the door. The next shot is a close-up of him sitting on the floor and the cord is mysteriously gone. At the end of the film, the three surviving members of the Hat Squad place their hats on the coffin of their fallen comrade. Nick Nolte then proceeds to put on his hat (not the one on the coffin) as they walk away. Where did that hat come from? The film has its moments but its poor writing and incredibly slow pace waste a great cast that tries as best they can to overcome the deficiencies of a crummy plot.

    With all the names in this film you'd think it would be "can't miss" material. The setting, in some respect, is challenging: MF is going to be compared to CHINATOWN and LA CONFIDENTIAL. Those two classics have nothing to fear. What MF offers is nothing more than ridiculous. The introductory scene has our fabulous four murdering a supposed mobster, though the only evil we know of the victim is sarcasm. Bad move. We are soon instructed to love the characters as altruistic. A significant portion of the film is the fab four riding around in their car wherein we're supposed to be entertained by unfunny and distracting banter. The plot is relatively simple and just gets dumber and dumberer. The casting of Nick Nolte is a mistake: We need a less intimidating character. Melanie Griffen and Andrew McCarthy give great performances that are wasted. John Malkovich and Treat Williams go through the motions. The sets and costumes are great, but the film's actual stars are Jennifer Connelly's breasts, variously covered and uncovered. What a waste of time and money.

    A top drawer cast stars in "Mulholland Falls," a 1996 film starring Nick Nolte, Chazz Palmentieri, Melanie Griffith, Jennifer Connelly, Michael Madsen, Treat Williams, Bruce Dern, and John Malkovich, directed by New Zealand director Lee Tamahori. Sometimes when I don't know the year of a film, I try to guess. I placed this film in 1998 because I concluded it must have come after "L.A. Confidential" since it's about '50s crime investigation. Also, Jennifer Connelly is very young here - reminiscent of the way she looked in "Dark City." I was two years off. The story concerns the L.A. Hat Squad, led by Max Hoover (Nolte) called to investigate the brutal murder of Allison Pond (Jennifer Connelly). When her body is turned over, Hoover realizes it's an ex-girlfriend. He's never told his wife (Melanie Griffith) about the affair, stating that he had the affair, it ended, no one got hurt, and to tell her would hurt her deeply. The investigation of the murder leads to a general (John Malkovich), an atom bomb testing site, secret film footage, and military secrets. Very good performances from everyone - had Nolte been able to keep his life together, he could have been up there with the very greatest. He's always been capable of truly great performances, all the way back to the "Rich Man, Poor Man" days. Here one can feel his tremendous sadness and weariness. It's a pall that hangs over the entire film. Jennifer Connelly, whose part isn't very large, is gorgeous, sexy, and tough. Melanie Griffith gives a mature performance as Hoover's wife. Uncredited in the film are Rob Lowe and Louise Fletcher. There is a very exciting scene at the end of the movie. "Mulholland Falls" never received the attention that "L.A. Confidential" did. One can blame marketing, but the story isn't special enough, the characters not as well delineated, and the pace is a bit too leisurely. This isn't to say it's not a good film. It's just not exceptional. I applaud anyone who does a period noir that comes off like a noir and not a bad attempt. There, "Mullholland Falls" succeeds admirably.

If you don't care about the core of the story, then it's difficult to have any real investment in the rest of the movie. In all honesty, even if the movie was in black and white and Jennifer Connelly had two times more scenes, this movie would probably still be boring. I just never cared or was interested in what was going on. Michael Madsen was wasted, there wasn't nearly enough of John Malkovich, and Nick Nolte was just smacking people and looking grim. Mulholland Falls gets two stars for Jennifer Connelly's magnificence, but even her wonders barely made it worth watching.

    "Mulholland Falls" is a murder mystery which, at the time of its release, failed to achieve a very positive response from either the critics or the public. This is unfortunate because it does have a number of qualities which make it both entertaining and praiseworthy and its evocation of the period in which it's set (the early 1950s) is both visually impressive and atmospheric. Director Lee Tamahori and cinematographer Haskell Wexler deserve credit for this as does Dave Grusin who was responsible for the marvellous original score. In typical film noir style, the main protagonist (in this case a police detective) finds himself in a situation in which he's out of his depth and then finds that further developments just continue to make things worse as he follows a route which seems destined to take him into a state of being both morally and emotionally impoverished. Max Hoover (Nick Nolte) is the leader of a squad of four LAPD detectives whose job is to get rid of gangsters and criminals and they do this very effectively. Their modus operandi is to dispense justice in a very brutal and unorthodox manner and they're able to do this with impunity because they have the support of their Chief of Police (Bruce Dern). When a woman's dead body is found at a construction site and the squad investigate, it soon emerges that she was Allison Pond (Jennifer Connelly). Pond was an aspiring actress and Hoover is shaken by what he finds because he'd previously had a six month affair with her before deciding to end the relationship. Shortly after, a film is discovered which shows Pond having sex with a man who turns out to be General Thomas Timms (John Malkovich). Timms is the head of the Atomic Energy Commission and when the squad continue their investigation they soon come up against hostility and threats from Colonel Fitzgerald (Treat Williams) and FBI Agent McCafferty (Daniel Baldwin) before discovering the existence of a conspiracy to conceal the activities of personnel at a military base where atomic bomb tests had been carried out. The anguish that Hoover experiences during this case is worsened when a film showing one of his encounters with Allison Pond comes into the possession of his wife Katherine (Melanie Griffith). Although he'd eventually finished his affair with Pond because he'd cared more for his wife, the pain of discovering his infidelity is no less intense for Katherine who is totally heartbroken. The reason why Pond was murdered is gradually revealed and Hoover and his partner Ellery Coolidge (Chazz Palminteri) have to engage in a frantic fight for their lives before the story comes to its sombre conclusion. Hoover's squad, which also comprises Coolidge, Eddie Hall (Michael Madsen) and Arthur Relyea (Chris Penn) is great fun to watch as its members swagger around in stylish suits or cruise around in a Buick convertible. The picture of the four of them standing on the edge of a bomb crater is also particularly striking. The closest relationship within the squad is between Hoover and Coolidge and in a significant departure from the otherwise macho ethos of the group, Coolidge is not only undergoing a course of counselling to deal with his temper and food issues but has also completely bought into the benefits of psychotherapy. When Hoover is worried about Katherine finding out about his affair, Coolidge suggests talking the matter through to reach a solution. This suggestion doesn't sit well with Hoover who sees it as an abdication of personal responsibility because taking Coolidge's advice would lead to two people being distressed by his actions instead of one. Also in one of the movie's most memorable lines, he underscores the philosophical difference between them when he says "here's something that doesn't cost you 25 bucks an hour.....you carry your own water Ellery......you understand? You carry your own water". "Mulholland Falls" boasts a star studded cast and some superb performances. Nolte is perfect in his role as someone who's tough, hard drinking, guilt ridden and given to outbursts of uncontrollable rage. John Malkovich excels as the eccentric Timms who says that "some people must die before their time so that others can live. It's a cornerstone of civilisation". Madsen and Penn are excellent in their support roles and Jennifer Conelly and Melanie Griffith both make a strong impression as women who unjustly experience very cruel treatment. There are also a number of great cameos to look out for from Andrew McCarthy, Louise Fletcher, Bruce Dern and Rob Lowe and even an exquisite rendition of "Harbour Lights" by Aaron Neville.

    Mulholland Falls is directed by Lee Tamahori and written by Pete Dexter. It stars Nick Nolte, Chazz Palminteri, Melanie Griffith, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, Jennifer Connelly, Treat Williams, John Malkovich, Bruce Dern and Andrew McCarthy. Music is by Dave Grusin and cinematography by Haskell Wexler. 1950s Los Angeles and four unorthodox detectives led by Maxwell Hoover (Nolte) are called in to investigate the death of a young woman found crushed at a construction site. The woman is revealed to be an aspiring actress who had recently had a relationship with the married Hoover. Can is open, and worms everywhere, and following those worms leads Hoover down murky avenues... It's the almost nearly great neo-noir movie, everything looks right in principal, it has a strongly assembled cast, the 50s visuals and cinematography are splendid, and the murder mystery element of the plot - with some added sex, sizzle and nuclear shenanigans - looks promising on the page. Yet it never delivers on that promise of being something dark, to be a labyrinthine noir thriller beating a black heart. It starts of so well, based on the infamous "Hat Squad" we reasonably expect the story to expand upon the opening macho machinations of the four tough hombres in the hats, but instead away from Nolte's grizzled Hoover, the other three guys are merely dressed up props. Which means there's some good actors wasted, sadly. As the plot moves slowly forward the investigation and Hoover character axis becomes less interesting. Griffith came in for some critical grief for a lacklustre performance, but she's done no favours by the writers who fail to give her marriage to Hoover any substance. So when things go pear shaped and the characters of Mr and Mrs Hoover should explode on the screen, we really don't care having had no interest previously to hang our emotional being on. It all builds to what can best be described as a poor pay off, the resolution to the hinted at muddy mystery is hardly shocking, and the "big" face-off sequence between good and bad guys (or bad and bad if you prefer) is about as exciting as watching paint dry. It's not an awful movie, but it is a very disappointing one. A film where a bit more thought given by the producers could have yielded so much more. 5/10

    I've found that if I somehow leave the room for food or a break, the film probably isn't really very good. Good or better keep me glued. I never left my seat during Mulholland Falls and from the opening sequences with the four LA cops in hats riding up sunny 1950's Hollywood Hills in a big black convertible, I was hooked. Hooked especially by a galvanizing, snappy performance by Nick Nolte as Hoover, head of his squad of four, a man of action before words, a man who simmers and glares and loves with passion: it's a performance that somehow should have been given more attention at the time of the film's release, a cops and crime film which somehow didn't match the zeitgeist of its period, lost in the shuffle. Almost every noir mystery past 1949 is a retread of some sort (Chinatown being a major exception),but what makes Mulholland Falls work is not the plot but the heady collection of dedicated supporting actors whether Melanie Griffith as a quietly restrained wife of a cop, or Chazz Palminteri, the wry right hand partner who talks about his psychiatrist without hesitation. The mystery deals with corruption in high places, of course, and John Malkovich and Treat Williams are good supports for Nolte to play against--but it's Nolte's show from start to finish and his intensity nails it!

    Wanna be L.A. Confidential was surprisingly released the year before but everything that that film got right this one gets wrong. The sets and costumes are pristine, not a single crease or smudge, that's the problem with them, everything looks new-not lived in. The actors some like Nolte and Madsen who would seem to be ideal for the period are as at sea as the miscast actors like Andrew McCarthy, who gives a fussy unconvincing turn, all are stiff and give no sense of actually living in the time period, everything feels very staged. The main fault lies with the director who doesn't seem to have a real feeling for the material and just wants to create pretty pictures. Adequate but nothing more.

    This film looks fantastic and is chock-full of great actors(Nick Nolte, Melanie Griffith, Chris Penn, Bruce Dern, John Malkovich, Chazz Palminteri, and more). A low-brow Chinatown. The 'look' of this film, and Nick Nolte's performance are the only things that are even close to the level of that earlier, finer work. However, this is well worth a view - especially if you are looking for a throwback escape from all the new release trash that's out there today. Sidenote: Jennifer Connelly's breasts should be the standard of perfection. Some of the fine actors have to take a backseat because there are just so many involved here. Nolte, however, is the star of this show, and his performance is definitely noteworthy. It's Nick's performance, and Tomahori's attention to graphic detail that make this film above average. The plot is an atomic bomb. You'll like this if you liked: Black Dahlia, L.A. Confidential(note: this movie is nowhere near that level), Miller's Crossing and Basic Instinct. 64/100

    When I watched this film recently I thought that it must have been made by people trying to capitalize on the success of L.A. Confidential. It has the same look and it has nothing short of a phenomenal cast list. But it actually came out a year before L.A. Confidential. I suspect that the L.A. Confidential producers wee quaking in their boots after this attempted film noir bombed at the box office. But of course, L.A. Confidential turned out to be a great success and is remembered as one of the truly great modern film noirs, combining all of the best features of a great film, and getting that 40's and 50's feeling just right. About all the Mulholland Falls gets right is the 40's and 50's feeling. But the cast of the Hat Squad come off as almost comic book figures. They drive around town in a big convertible but their hats never even flicker, less blow off in the breeze, even when they are trying to outrace an Army jeep at a nuclear test site. Indoors, they take off their coats but never their hats. The pace of the movie is glacially slow. It's difficult to stay awake. The writing is sub-par and all too predictable. The two talented and beautiful women in the movie, Melanie Griffith and Jennifer Connelly are largely wasted with relatively little screen time. In one comical scene Connelly is slapped by her mobster boyfriend and barely flinches. She returns the slap and almost knocks the guy over. Aren't mobsters supposed to be able to hit better than that? Or at least take a slap from a girl? Parts of the plot are beyond ridiculous. At the nuclear test site, the Hat Squad takes off down a road marked restricted, shoots the padlock off a locked gate, and then acts surprised when the Army comes after them. And John Malkovich as an effete and intellectual Army general in a red smoking jacket is so out of place to be absurd. Continuity is also a shambles in this film. During the airplane fight, Treat Williams has one of the rip cords from a parachute tied around his neck as he is thrown to the floor of the plane in front of the door. The next shot is a close-up of him sitting on the floor and the cord is mysteriously gone. At the end of the film, the three surviving members of the Hat Squad place their hats on the coffin of their fallen comrade. Nick Nolte then proceeds to put on his hat (not the one on the coffin) as they walk away. Where did that hat come from? The film has its moments but its poor writing and incredibly slow pace waste a great cast that tries as best they can to overcome the deficiencies of a crummy plot.

    With all the names in this film you'd think it would be "can't miss" material. The setting, in some respect, is challenging: MF is going to be compared to CHINATOWN and LA CONFIDENTIAL. Those two classics have nothing to fear. What MF offers is nothing more than ridiculous. The introductory scene has our fabulous four murdering a supposed mobster, though the only evil we know of the victim is sarcasm. Bad move. We are soon instructed to love the characters as altruistic. A significant portion of the film is the fab four riding around in their car wherein we're supposed to be entertained by unfunny and distracting banter. The plot is relatively simple and just gets dumber and dumberer. The casting of Nick Nolte is a mistake: We need a less intimidating character. Melanie Griffen and Andrew McCarthy give great performances that are wasted. John Malkovich and Treat Williams go through the motions. The sets and costumes are great, but the film's actual stars are Jennifer Connelly's breasts, variously covered and uncovered. What a waste of time and money.

    A top drawer cast stars in "Mulholland Falls," a 1996 film starring Nick Nolte, Chazz Palmentieri, Melanie Griffith, Jennifer Connelly, Michael Madsen, Treat Williams, Bruce Dern, and John Malkovich, directed by New Zealand director Lee Tamahori. Sometimes when I don't know the year of a film, I try to guess. I placed this film in 1998 because I concluded it must have come after "L.A. Confidential" since it's about '50s crime investigation. Also, Jennifer Connelly is very young here - reminiscent of the way she looked in "Dark City." I was two years off. The story concerns the L.A. Hat Squad, led by Max Hoover (Nolte) called to investigate the brutal murder of Allison Pond (Jennifer Connelly). When her body is turned over, Hoover realizes it's an ex-girlfriend. He's never told his wife (Melanie Griffith) about the affair, stating that he had the affair, it ended, no one got hurt, and to tell her would hurt her deeply. The investigation of the murder leads to a general (John Malkovich), an atom bomb testing site, secret film footage, and military secrets. Very good performances from everyone - had Nolte been able to keep his life together, he could have been up there with the very greatest. He's always been capable of truly great performances, all the way back to the "Rich Man, Poor Man" days. Here one can feel his tremendous sadness and weariness. It's a pall that hangs over the entire film. Jennifer Connelly, whose part isn't very large, is gorgeous, sexy, and tough. Melanie Griffith gives a mature performance as Hoover's wife. Uncredited in the film are Rob Lowe and Louise Fletcher. There is a very exciting scene at the end of the movie. "Mulholland Falls" never received the attention that "L.A. Confidential" did. One can blame marketing, but the story isn't special enough, the characters not as well delineated, and the pace is a bit too leisurely. This isn't to say it's not a good film. It's just not exceptional. I applaud anyone who does a period noir that comes off like a noir and not a bad attempt. There, "Mullholland Falls" succeeds admirably.

    I quite like films like Mulholland Falls; films about shady, down-beat and supposedly emotionless American detectives searching for something dear as they do their best to hide the fact that it means that much to them. Films that are daft enough but enjoyable enough to have their leads be able to spot vital clues linked to the overall success of their goal whilst being in a state of near intoxication by way of hard alcohol. Nick Nolte's character does this towards the end of Mulholland Falls when watching a short, silent piece of moving image footage, but there you go. The film itself is a dank and involving noir inspired thriller from 1996 about corruption and murder amidst the higher-ups of the nation and one man's quest to uncover it; only, he doesn't know it at the time. The beauty of these stories is that they establish a hard-as-nails male lead whom keeps within his little pool of dishing out pain and retribution, effectively, before broadening them out into a wider scope of scum and dispute; the catch being that the negative characteristics on these outside of the pool are tougher to spot: they're still there, but they hide amidst this sea of expensive furniture, clothing and generally plush mise-en-scene. The film begins with two 8MM pieces of film footage that we feel we have no right to observe: some blast footage of an atomic weapon being tested and therefore detonated, exemplified when we sporadically cut to another film and an army official pushing the camera operator, ie; the audience, away from the general area; as well as another film in which a mounted camera is pointing at two people about to engage in sexual activity. Such is the tone the film will take, and such is the battle the lead has on him that in order to succeed in his mission, he'll need to break on through and confront things that certain others would rather you wouldn't see or realise were there. Corruption is a rife and pleasurable theme for classical film noir, or more contemporary noirs that pay homage; corruption usually equating to cheating, lying or deception and when the general ingredients are on the money; the piece ends up worth seeing. The film would have you think it's about four guys, police officers in 1950s Los Angeles, taking names and kicking their way around town, bullying those they deem guilty of whatever crime by tossing them down a hill just off Mulholland Drive. At least it might've been about that had it been set several years prior to events here. Here, Nolte's cop named Max Hoover gets in way over his head and finds himself on a road to all things dangerous when he and his crew come across a woman firmly embedded within the ground out in the open wilderness nearby a construction site. It looks like she's hit the ground from a great height, but everyone's puzzled as to how it might have happened. Further more, Hoover knows the girl from recent times. Hoover has a wife he struggles to truly connect with over the course of the film, she's young; attractive and enjoys reading Hemingway, but like most films about butch men working together for the greater-good; Mulholland Falls is more interested in a relationship between two males, that of Hoover and Chazz Palminteri's cop Elleroy Coolidge, a guy in that group of four which also consisted of Michael Madsen and Chris Penn  but loosing both of them would do the film no harm. The death of the young girl, a certain Allison Pond (Connelly), affects Hoover in ways that doesn't see him afraid to admit to, purely because he once upon a time had an affair with her, rendering the investigation somewhat personal rather than just strictly business. What do we come to learn of Palminteri's character? Well, we learn that it's not wise to back chat him just prior to taking a drink out of a glass full of something, but we also come to find of the issues he carries; someone whom it is revealed suffers from personal problems of his own and much to some of the other hard-nosed archetype cop's confusion; his issues and the exploration of them somewhat going against what it is that makes these archetypes in these sorts of films so recognisable. Coolidge's thoughts on the Western film genre, for one, is supposed to signify a broader sense of thinking away from all the hard-nosed work while his linking this to thoughts on the ramifications certain events have on future items display a meek sense of sensory awareness. It is no coincidence then that the two find a degree of solace with one another and it ought not be much of a surprise to see Coolidge connect with Hoover in the way they do; one coming to the other's aid and sharing the burden of the film's denouement together. The film eventually branches out into a feud between those within the world of the 'just', a sort of documentation of the birth of internal affairs, only not making out that that's what it is particularly evident; instead delivering dramatically rather than historically a tight enough narrative to do with corruption and 'the enemy within' linked to the F.B.I. and The U.S. Army. Yes, there are sequences that feel patched on; yes, we know exactly who'll survive and who won't survive certain gunfights half way through and yes, it really could do without two of its four leads of whom the film barely makes any attempt to really get the most out of the performers in question, but Mulholland Falls is a knowing if somewhat flimsy tale of a man's life coming apart as he confronts past mistakes and current ones on the state's behalf.

    This movie needed more Jennifer Connelly, and it needed to be in black and white. I'm sorry, but noir never really works for me unless it's steeped in shadows and a colorless world. That's just what I've been conditioned to expect from a good noir movie. If Mulholland Falls would have been set in the modern day, I think that the color wouldn't have bothered me as much, but the combination of the time period and the style makes the colorization just to much for me to tolerate. As for Jennifer, she's the crux of the film, but we don't get to spend very much time at all with her. We don't get a sense of who she is and why she did the things that she did, and that greatly lessens the impact of her death. If you don't care about the core of the story, then it's difficult to have any real investment in the rest of the movie. In all honesty, even if the movie was in black and white and Jennifer Connelly had two times more scenes, this movie would probably still be boring. I just never cared or was interested in what was going on. Michael Madsen was wasted, there wasn't nearly enough of John Malkovich, and Nick Nolte was just smacking people and looking grim. Mulholland Falls gets two stars for Jennifer Connelly's magnificence, but even her wonders barely made it worth watching.
