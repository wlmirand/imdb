 <sinopse>
  An incompetent, immature, and dimwitted heir to an auto parts factory must save the business to keep it out of the hands of his new, con-artist relatives and big business.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Tommy Callahan Jr. is a slow-witted, clumsy guy who recently graduated college after attending for seven years. His father, Big Tom Callahan, owns an auto parts factory in Ohio. When Tommy arrives back home, he finds he has a position at the factory waiting for him. His dad also introduces Tommy to the new brake pad division of the factory and to Tommy's soon-to-be stepmother, Beverly, and her son Paul. But when Big Tom dies, the factory threatens to go under unless the new brake pads are to be sold. Therefore, Tommy must go on the road to sell them, along with the assistance of Richard, Big Tom's right-hand man. Will Tommy save the company, or will the factory, and the town, go under?

    There are only so many iconic funny films out there and this is one of them. People may think the film is stupid and has no message but I think as long as you can watch it over and over again and still think it's funny then it should be in the history books and worthy of my gratitude. How many films do you watch once and never watch again!!!! This is a tribute to Chris Farley and even Black sheep was brilliant but not as good, but I can still watch it over and over and be in stitches. David spade is absolutely brilliant also as is a very funny actor and comedian.My hat off to them both.RIP Chris Farley.

    Granted, I'm an avid Spade and Farley fan...but I cherish this movie. Light-hearted, slapstick humor, and the 90's Belushi and Ackroyd...how can you lose? It's not meant to be taken seriously, but it's unexpectedly heartwarming and hilarious to witness Spade and Farley as they were in real life...best friends and comrades. The chemistry is undeniable, and in addition to the wonderful duo are Rob Lowe, Brian Dennehy, Bo Derek, and Dan Ackroyd himself. If you love the Spade and Farley you've seen on Saturday Night Live, you'll appreciate this movie. I've seen it a million and one times, and it never gets old. It remains a classic in my house.

When Tommy arrives home, he finds he has a position at the factory waiting for him. His dad also introduces Tommy to his soon-to-be stepmother, Beverly, and her son Paul. But when Big Tom dies, the factory threatens to go under unless new brake pads are sold. Tommy must go on the road to sell them, along with the assistance of Richard, Big Tom's right-hand man..... Here in England, this was the only Farley film that made it to the big screen, partly because at the time this sort of humour was deemed to immature for wide release. Now cinemas are rife with this stuff, thanks to the dumbing down of civilisation. It's throwaway stuff, and while the film lasts, it's okay. It would have been good to see if Farley would have become something, because his films were on a par with Sandlers at the time. Narrative is straight forward, and the whole point of the film is Farley falling over, being silly, and having crazy hair, while David Spade stands there and rolls his eyes. It's all predictable stuff, there is a point in the film, like every film like this, where they think all is lost, and then they redeem themselves. Forgettable, but slightly endearing.

    Dumb comedies and gross-outs don't do anything for me , usually doing the opposite and make me want to flick my eyeballs out with a sharp pencil. This mad, fast paced craze-fest is so infectiously delirious that it'd be inhuman not to warm to it and ultimately, rather like it. Or love it, though I'm not sure I want to go that far.... Chris Farley is a comic actor unknown to me, apart from his parts in Waynes World, which I saw so long ago, I cannot remember him. I understand that he was one of a kind and much loved. Comparisons with the Farrelly brothers cannot be dismissed, but Tommy Boy just seems less lame and crude and has more zest and genuine enthusiasm, by all in it. And I'm not sure that the Farrelly's could extend a script about brake pads over 90 minutes, either! It's good to see Dan Ackroyd and Bo Derek, Ackroyd himself being another great comic actor. David Spade I really don't know but he makes a great Laurel to Farley's modern day Hardy. Big on size, heart and character, was Mr Farley. Not one I'll be buying on DVD but did enjoy my seeing it on Sky Movies.

    The humor in Tommy Boy is nothing of high quality, and people shouldn't look at it as "the funniest film ever made." It's a mindless, joyous, rowdy ride through non-offensive material with two lead actors giving their all and forming simple and sincere chemistry. Now how can you hate a movie like that? The hate that this film has gotten is undeserving, really. It's nothing more than comedic fluff. Slapstick is a hard thing to achieve, and usually dumb laughs are the only thing a movie in this genre does achieve. Tommy Boy achieves great chemistry between two actors, good laughs, and sincere characters all in its short runtime. To begin with, when dealing with slapstick you need a likable, unoffensive star who is capable of being sweet and goofy. Farley just works. And he shows it explicitly here. Plot-wise, the film focuses on goofball Tommy Callahan III (Farley) who has just graduated College and is on to take over his father's company, Callahan Autos. His father (Dennehy) is about to get married again, but collapses and dies while dancing on his big night. Callahan Autos is trying to sell half a million brake pads, and now their time is shortened even more seeing as the death of their boss has left them very vulnerable. Tommy teams up with Richard (Spade), a goody two-shoes employee of his fathers who is jealous of Tommy's nice treatment and ability to be lackadaisical and be rewarded for it, to try and sell as many break pads to different companies across the US so they can make one last attempt to save the company. As you can imagine, the trip is where the duo are going to encounter the most antics. Some are funny, some are tone-deaf and go on for way too long. Tommy Boy does rip off some more successful films like the pool scene from National Lampoon's Vacation, but after a while, it begins to fade into the background and it's something that isn't obtrusive before long. This is a different kind of buddy comedy, because the buddies aren't really buddies, but rather, acquaintances. They're not two best friends hanging out, having fun on a road trip. One's antics leave the other one in a state of overwhelming disgust. Richard becomes Tommy's critic, smart-Alec self-conscious, and verbal abuser. In fact, Spade gets the most laughs out of everyone in the film. Farley is usually the but of every joke, as you'd expect. So maybe Farley isn't a good actor as much as he is a good punchline? Director Peter Segal also worked the camera when it was time to shoot Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult, so it's possible that a year later he'd like to spoof the buddy comedy genre by ultimately incorporating two characters who just simply tolerate each other for much of the film. Of course that is as far-fetched of an explanation I think I ever went for. Tommy Boy is funny and that's all there is to it. It's charming, creative, and works on the level it wants to. Starring: Chris Farley, David Spade, Bo Derek, Julie Warner, Dan Aykroyd, Brian Dennehy, and Rob Lowe (uncredited). Directed by: Peter Segal.

    Tommy Boy Tommy boy is one of my all time favorite movies. Chris Farley and David Spade as a pair make laughter the norm. As is other big movies Peter Segal was the director of this movie. This 1995 movie has carved future movies into the dumb but funny category. Tommy being the clumsy guy as he is has finally graduated college after 7 years. His father "big Tom" owns an auto parts store in which Tommy has a job waiting for him on his arrival home. Big Tom introduces his new brake pad factory to Tommy and others. Big Tom at the time is about to get married which turns out to be a fraud. After the Marriage Big Toms die on stage of his reception. After loosing big Tom the factory is hurting. Tommy has now teamed up with Richard (David Spade) on a long journey to sell brake pads and keep the business afloat. All the actors in the movie played there act on spot. Tommy as the big dumb guy who can't ever be serious makes the whole movie funny. Richard, the book geek who is small and fearful. The movie was well rounded and not only kept you laughing but the story line also kept you interested. Some key video techniques can be found when the deer wakes up and destroys Richard's car. This deer completely destroys It which doesn't seem possible. After its done and the deer runs off Tommy pauses and says " I swear I've seen a lot of stuff in my day but that was.Awesome, but sorry about your car man, that sucks." A part in which the movie was made better is when Richard and Tommy are arguing what to listen to in the car, Tommy turns it to some old romantic song. They both say you can change it if you want, no one changes it and the next scene there both crying it and singing it to were Tommy almost wrecks the car. Overall the movie is a funny movie to watch and has many quote worthy lines in it. I think it was put together nicely and If only Farley was still here to keep the laughter going.

    This is a funny film - genuinely. It produces a few giggles and one or two howls of laughter. Chris Farley is great, as usual. Totally unique and talented. But he plays a really talentless young man in this film, who screws up everything. Skinny David Spade is the perfect choice as the exact opposite of the over-weight Farley. Things he says, especially some of his side remarks, are really quite amusing. The funniest scene is at the petrol station. I find that just hilarious. If you're looking for a 90 minute piece of half decent entertainment that is really simple to follow, then here is a film for you. It'll be cheap wherever you get it from.

    Chris Farley and David Spade star in the ultimate buddy picture that contains all the funny moments, and the heartwarming material. "Tommy Boy" takes place on Chris Farley going on an important business trip, taking the place of his deceased father, that can mean the jobs of everybody in Sandusky, with David Spade along for the ride. With a new family that could mean trouble that tries to bring down Callahan auto, Tommy must sell about half a million brake pads, before the factory goes under. Now, Chris Farley may bring too much energy, and turn into a maniac, but it's just way too funny, and the dynamic duo of Farley and Spade end up creating a hilarious chemistry between the two buddies, after working with each other on "Saturday Night Live". SNL creator Lorne Michaels has helped make the movie become an SNL sketch, or a long SNL sketch. So the movie was funny in every way, and the well-written wacky script felt so comedic and way deserving. From running over a dead deer, dancing in the gas station with cow crap all over, to Dan Aykroyd's incredible cameo role, "Tommy Boy" is a well-deserving laugh, and it's fun to never forget it. "Tommy Boy", in my review, "a well-deserved comedy from the minds of SNL".

    Chris Farley had a lot of fans. Well, despite his premature death he still has quite a lot of fans. With all due respect to the man, I'm not one of them. His best performance remains, for me, his fantastic turn as the man with no nose in the hilarious Dirty Work. Tommy Boy is, believe it or not, a kind of comedy riff on Hamlet. However, Shakespeare lovers may want to stay away from this one. The comedy begins as Tommy (Chris Farley) finally graduates after a ridiculously long time. He heads home to be with his father, big Tom (Brian Dennehy), and also meets his father's new bride (Bo Derek) and a troublemaker introduced as her son (Rob Lowe). All seems good for Tommy, not so good for Richard (David Spade), who has to act as an assistant to the buffoon when big Tom gives him an office and tries to get him learning the ropes of the family business. Richard has his work cut out for him when tragedy strikes and it's up to young Tommy to make sure the business stays solvent. Directed by Peter Segal, and with a decent script full of great barbs from Bonnie and Terry Turner, Tommy Boy could have been something very funny indeed. Instead, it relies too much on Farley's schtick, which can quickly become grating to those of us who aren't fans. His constant cries of "son of a . . ." and "holy schnike!" are extremely irritating and it's hard to see how the manic, stupid, childish character that he plays could ever win anyone over, let alone get to spend some quality time with Julie Warner (who plays Michelle, a co-worker and potential love interest). David Spade - now THAT guy is funny. His delivery of insulting one-liners is practically perfect and you understand his growing frustration as things get worse and worse for him. Dennehy is good enough, Bo Derek lends her beauty and Rob Lowe gets some laughs as his character goes through a number of mishaps. There's also an amusing small turn from Dan Aykroyd as Zalinsky, a big competitor who has offered to buy the business. It rattles along at a decent pace, keeps things relatively light and breezy and throws some good songs on the soundtrack (the moments with Farley and Spade singing together as they drive across the country are, I must say, actually pretty damn funny) but the central character just isn't likable enough to carry the whole thing. Dumb can be funny but the sweetness or innocence at the centre has to be played just right or it doesn't work. In Dumb & Dumber, for example, we had the two leads who never once considered how they appeared to others with their childish exuberance and juvenile antics. Here in Tommy Boy we get the occasional moment clumsily shoe-horned in there to show that Tommy has feelings too. It just doesn't work, somehow, but there are still plenty of laughs to be had throughout the film and fans of Farley can easily add a point or two.

    It's not a pure comedy. Yet well mixed with drama and romance. Even for it's old age it's defiantly a good movie. I didn't only laugh but "enjoyed" the movie. It has the right amount of romance and violent scenes. I would've given it 9/10 if I'd watched it in 1995. It starts lame but brings up the game as the movie goes on. It's important to point out that at some points while watching, you feel left-out with some unlinked scenes and phrases. Sometimes actions happen dramatically and doesn't make sense. But we can forgive it as the story is long enough and it would have been a 3 hours movie otherwise. I do recommend it to anyone feeling frustrated or just wants a relief. But it's not a movie to have fun and laugh watching. "It's a one to enjoy"

"Tommy Boy" takes place on Chris Farley going on an important business trip, taking the place of his deceased father, that can mean the jobs of everybody in Sandusky, with David Spade along for the ride. With a new family that could mean trouble that tries to bring down Callahan auto, Tommy must sell about half a million brake pads, before the factory goes under. Now, Chris Farley may bring too much energy, and turn into a maniac, but it's just way too funny, and the dynamic duo of Farley and Spade end up creating a hilarious chemistry between the two buddies, after working with each other on "Saturday Night Live". SNL creator Lorne Michaels has helped make the movie become an SNL sketch, or a long SNL sketch. So the movie was funny in every way, and the well-written wacky script felt so comedic and way deserving. From running over a dead deer, dancing in the gas station with cow crap all over, to Dan Aykroyd's incredible cameo role, "Tommy Boy" is a well-deserving laugh, and it's fun to never forget it. "Tommy Boy", in my review, "a well-deserved comedy from the minds of SNL".

    Chris Farley had a lot of fans. Well, despite his premature death he still has quite a lot of fans. With all due respect to the man, I'm not one of them. His best performance remains, for me, his fantastic turn as the man with no nose in the hilarious Dirty Work. Tommy Boy is, believe it or not, a kind of comedy riff on Hamlet. However, Shakespeare lovers may want to stay away from this one. The comedy begins as Tommy (Chris Farley) finally graduates after a ridiculously long time. He heads home to be with his father, big Tom (Brian Dennehy), and also meets his father's new bride (Bo Derek) and a troublemaker introduced as her son (Rob Lowe). All seems good for Tommy, not so good for Richard (David Spade), who has to act as an assistant to the buffoon when big Tom gives him an office and tries to get him learning the ropes of the family business. Richard has his work cut out for him when tragedy strikes and it's up to young Tommy to make sure the business stays solvent. Directed by Peter Segal, and with a decent script full of great barbs from Bonnie and Terry Turner, Tommy Boy could have been something very funny indeed. Instead, it relies too much on Farley's schtick, which can quickly become grating to those of us who aren't fans. His constant cries of "son of a . . ." and "holy schnike!" are extremely irritating and it's hard to see how the manic, stupid, childish character that he plays could ever win anyone over, let alone get to spend some quality time with Julie Warner (who plays Michelle, a co-worker and potential love interest). David Spade - now THAT guy is funny. His delivery of insulting one-liners is practically perfect and you understand his growing frustration as things get worse and worse for him. Dennehy is good enough, Bo Derek lends her beauty and Rob Lowe gets some laughs as his character goes through a number of mishaps. There's also an amusing small turn from Dan Aykroyd as Zalinsky, a big competitor who has offered to buy the business. It rattles along at a decent pace, keeps things relatively light and breezy and throws some good songs on the soundtrack (the moments with Farley and Spade singing together as they drive across the country are, I must say, actually pretty damn funny) but the central character just isn't likable enough to carry the whole thing. Dumb can be funny but the sweetness or innocence at the centre has to be played just right or it doesn't work. In Dumb & Dumber, for example, we had the two leads who never once considered how they appeared to others with their childish exuberance and juvenile antics. Here in Tommy Boy we get the occasional moment clumsily shoe-horned in there to show that Tommy has feelings too. It just doesn't work, somehow, but there are still plenty of laughs to be had throughout the film and fans of Farley can easily add a point or two.

    It's not a pure comedy. Yet well mixed with drama and romance. Even for it's old age it's defiantly a good movie. I didn't only laugh but "enjoyed" the movie. It has the right amount of romance and violent scenes. I would've given it 9/10 if I'd watched it in 1995. It starts lame but brings up the game as the movie goes on. It's important to point out that at some points while watching, you feel left-out with some unlinked scenes and phrases. Sometimes actions happen dramatically and doesn't make sense. But we can forgive it as the story is long enough and it would have been a 3 hours movie otherwise. I do recommend it to anyone feeling frustrated or just wants a relief. But it's not a movie to have fun and laugh watching. "It's a one to enjoy"

    There are only so many iconic funny films out there and this is one of them. People may think the film is stupid and has no message but I think as long as you can watch it over and over again and still think it's funny then it should be in the history books and worthy of my gratitude. How many films do you watch once and never watch again!!!! This is a tribute to Chris Farley and even Black sheep was brilliant but not as good, but I can still watch it over and over and be in stitches. David spade is absolutely brilliant also as is a very funny actor and comedian.My hat off to them both.RIP Chris Farley.

    Granted, I'm an avid Spade and Farley fan...but I cherish this movie. Light-hearted, slapstick humor, and the 90's Belushi and Ackroyd...how can you lose? It's not meant to be taken seriously, but it's unexpectedly heartwarming and hilarious to witness Spade and Farley as they were in real life...best friends and comrades. The chemistry is undeniable, and in addition to the wonderful duo are Rob Lowe, Brian Dennehy, Bo Derek, and Dan Ackroyd himself. If you love the Spade and Farley you've seen on Saturday Night Live, you'll appreciate this movie. I've seen it a million and one times, and it never gets old. It remains a classic in my house.

    Tommy is a slow-witted, clumsy guy who recently graduated college after attending for seven years. His father, Big Tom Callahan, owns an auto parts factory. When Tommy arrives home, he finds he has a position at the factory waiting for him. His dad also introduces Tommy to his soon-to-be stepmother, Beverly, and her son Paul. But when Big Tom dies, the factory threatens to go under unless new brake pads are sold. Tommy must go on the road to sell them, along with the assistance of Richard, Big Tom's right-hand man..... Here in England, this was the only Farley film that made it to the big screen, partly because at the time this sort of humour was deemed to immature for wide release. Now cinemas are rife with this stuff, thanks to the dumbing down of civilisation. It's throwaway stuff, and while the film lasts, it's okay. It would have been good to see if Farley would have become something, because his films were on a par with Sandlers at the time. Narrative is straight forward, and the whole point of the film is Farley falling over, being silly, and having crazy hair, while David Spade stands there and rolls his eyes. It's all predictable stuff, there is a point in the film, like every film like this, where they think all is lost, and then they redeem themselves. Forgettable, but slightly endearing.

    Dumb comedies and gross-outs don't do anything for me , usually doing the opposite and make me want to flick my eyeballs out with a sharp pencil. This mad, fast paced craze-fest is so infectiously delirious that it'd be inhuman not to warm to it and ultimately, rather like it. Or love it, though I'm not sure I want to go that far.... Chris Farley is a comic actor unknown to me, apart from his parts in Waynes World, which I saw so long ago, I cannot remember him. I understand that he was one of a kind and much loved. Comparisons with the Farrelly brothers cannot be dismissed, but Tommy Boy just seems less lame and crude and has more zest and genuine enthusiasm, by all in it. And I'm not sure that the Farrelly's could extend a script about brake pads over 90 minutes, either! It's good to see Dan Ackroyd and Bo Derek, Ackroyd himself being another great comic actor. David Spade I really don't know but he makes a great Laurel to Farley's modern day Hardy. Big on size, heart and character, was Mr Farley. Not one I'll be buying on DVD but did enjoy my seeing it on Sky Movies.

    The humor in Tommy Boy is nothing of high quality, and people shouldn't look at it as "the funniest film ever made." It's a mindless, joyous, rowdy ride through non-offensive material with two lead actors giving their all and forming simple and sincere chemistry. Now how can you hate a movie like that? The hate that this film has gotten is undeserving, really. It's nothing more than comedic fluff. Slapstick is a hard thing to achieve, and usually dumb laughs are the only thing a movie in this genre does achieve. Tommy Boy achieves great chemistry between two actors, good laughs, and sincere characters all in its short runtime. To begin with, when dealing with slapstick you need a likable, unoffensive star who is capable of being sweet and goofy. Farley just works. And he shows it explicitly here. Plot-wise, the film focuses on goofball Tommy Callahan III (Farley) who has just graduated College and is on to take over his father's company, Callahan Autos. His father (Dennehy) is about to get married again, but collapses and dies while dancing on his big night. Callahan Autos is trying to sell half a million brake pads, and now their time is shortened even more seeing as the death of their boss has left them very vulnerable. Tommy teams up with Richard (Spade), a goody two-shoes employee of his fathers who is jealous of Tommy's nice treatment and ability to be lackadaisical and be rewarded for it, to try and sell as many break pads to different companies across the US so they can make one last attempt to save the company. As you can imagine, the trip is where the duo are going to encounter the most antics. Some are funny, some are tone-deaf and go on for way too long. Tommy Boy does rip off some more successful films like the pool scene from National Lampoon's Vacation, but after a while, it begins to fade into the background and it's something that isn't obtrusive before long. This is a different kind of buddy comedy, because the buddies aren't really buddies, but rather, acquaintances. They're not two best friends hanging out, having fun on a road trip. One's antics leave the other one in a state of overwhelming disgust. Richard becomes Tommy's critic, smart-Alec self-conscious, and verbal abuser. In fact, Spade gets the most laughs out of everyone in the film. Farley is usually the but of every joke, as you'd expect. So maybe Farley isn't a good actor as much as he is a good punchline? Director Peter Segal also worked the camera when it was time to shoot Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult, so it's possible that a year later he'd like to spoof the buddy comedy genre by ultimately incorporating two characters who just simply tolerate each other for much of the film. Of course that is as far-fetched of an explanation I think I ever went for. Tommy Boy is funny and that's all there is to it. It's charming, creative, and works on the level it wants to. Starring: Chris Farley, David Spade, Bo Derek, Julie Warner, Dan Aykroyd, Brian Dennehy, and Rob Lowe (uncredited). Directed by: Peter Segal.

    Tommy Boy Tommy boy is one of my all time favorite movies. Chris Farley and David Spade as a pair make laughter the norm. As is other big movies Peter Segal was the director of this movie. This 1995 movie has carved future movies into the dumb but funny category. Tommy being the clumsy guy as he is has finally graduated college after 7 years. His father "big Tom" owns an auto parts store in which Tommy has a job waiting for him on his arrival home. Big Tom introduces his new brake pad factory to Tommy and others. Big Tom at the time is about to get married which turns out to be a fraud. After the Marriage Big Toms die on stage of his reception. After loosing big Tom the factory is hurting. Tommy has now teamed up with Richard (David Spade) on a long journey to sell brake pads and keep the business afloat. All the actors in the movie played there act on spot. Tommy as the big dumb guy who can't ever be serious makes the whole movie funny. Richard, the book geek who is small and fearful. The movie was well rounded and not only kept you laughing but the story line also kept you interested. Some key video techniques can be found when the deer wakes up and destroys Richard's car. This deer completely destroys It which doesn't seem possible. After its done and the deer runs off Tommy pauses and says " I swear I've seen a lot of stuff in my day but that was.Awesome, but sorry about your car man, that sucks." A part in which the movie was made better is when Richard and Tommy are arguing what to listen to in the car, Tommy turns it to some old romantic song. They both say you can change it if you want, no one changes it and the next scene there both crying it and singing it to were Tommy almost wrecks the car. Overall the movie is a funny movie to watch and has many quote worthy lines in it. I think it was put together nicely and If only Farley was still here to keep the laughter going.

    This is a funny film - genuinely. It produces a few giggles and one or two howls of laughter. Chris Farley is great, as usual. Totally unique and talented. But he plays a really talentless young man in this film, who screws up everything. Skinny David Spade is the perfect choice as the exact opposite of the over-weight Farley. Things he says, especially some of his side remarks, are really quite amusing. The funniest scene is at the petrol station. I find that just hilarious. If you're looking for a 90 minute piece of half decent entertainment that is really simple to follow, then here is a film for you. It'll be cheap wherever you get it from.

His father "big Tom" owns an auto parts store in which Tommy has a job waiting for him on his arrival home. Big Tom introduces his new brake pad factory to Tommy and others. Big Tom at the time is about to get married which turns out to be a fraud. After the Marriage Big Toms die on stage of his reception. After loosing big Tom the factory is hurting. Tommy has now teamed up with Richard (David Spade) on a long journey to sell brake pads and keep the business afloat. All the actors in the movie played there act on spot. Tommy as the big dumb guy who can't ever be serious makes the whole movie funny. Richard, the book geek who is small and fearful. The movie was well rounded and not only kept you laughing but the story line also kept you interested. Some key video techniques can be found when the deer wakes up and destroys Richard's car. This deer completely destroys It which doesn't seem possible. After its done and the deer runs off Tommy pauses and says " I swear I've seen a lot of stuff in my day but that was.Awesome, but sorry about your car man, that sucks." A part in which the movie was made better is when Richard and Tommy are arguing what to listen to in the car, Tommy turns it to some old romantic song. They both say you can change it if you want, no one changes it and the next scene there both crying it and singing it to were Tommy almost wrecks the car. Overall the movie is a funny movie to watch and has many quote worthy lines in it. I think it was put together nicely and If only Farley was still here to keep the laughter going.

    This is a funny film - genuinely. It produces a few giggles and one or two howls of laughter. Chris Farley is great, as usual. Totally unique and talented. But he plays a really talentless young man in this film, who screws up everything. Skinny David Spade is the perfect choice as the exact opposite of the over-weight Farley. Things he says, especially some of his side remarks, are really quite amusing. The funniest scene is at the petrol station. I find that just hilarious. If you're looking for a 90 minute piece of half decent entertainment that is really simple to follow, then here is a film for you. It'll be cheap wherever you get it from.

    Chris Farley and David Spade star in the ultimate buddy picture that contains all the funny moments, and the heartwarming material. "Tommy Boy" takes place on Chris Farley going on an important business trip, taking the place of his deceased father, that can mean the jobs of everybody in Sandusky, with David Spade along for the ride. With a new family that could mean trouble that tries to bring down Callahan auto, Tommy must sell about half a million brake pads, before the factory goes under. Now, Chris Farley may bring too much energy, and turn into a maniac, but it's just way too funny, and the dynamic duo of Farley and Spade end up creating a hilarious chemistry between the two buddies, after working with each other on "Saturday Night Live". SNL creator Lorne Michaels has helped make the movie become an SNL sketch, or a long SNL sketch. So the movie was funny in every way, and the well-written wacky script felt so comedic and way deserving. From running over a dead deer, dancing in the gas station with cow crap all over, to Dan Aykroyd's incredible cameo role, "Tommy Boy" is a well-deserving laugh, and it's fun to never forget it. "Tommy Boy", in my review, "a well-deserved comedy from the minds of SNL".

    Chris Farley had a lot of fans. Well, despite his premature death he still has quite a lot of fans. With all due respect to the man, I'm not one of them. His best performance remains, for me, his fantastic turn as the man with no nose in the hilarious Dirty Work. Tommy Boy is, believe it or not, a kind of comedy riff on Hamlet. However, Shakespeare lovers may want to stay away from this one. The comedy begins as Tommy (Chris Farley) finally graduates after a ridiculously long time. He heads home to be with his father, big Tom (Brian Dennehy), and also meets his father's new bride (Bo Derek) and a troublemaker introduced as her son (Rob Lowe). All seems good for Tommy, not so good for Richard (David Spade), who has to act as an assistant to the buffoon when big Tom gives him an office and tries to get him learning the ropes of the family business. Richard has his work cut out for him when tragedy strikes and it's up to young Tommy to make sure the business stays solvent. Directed by Peter Segal, and with a decent script full of great barbs from Bonnie and Terry Turner, Tommy Boy could have been something very funny indeed. Instead, it relies too much on Farley's schtick, which can quickly become grating to those of us who aren't fans. His constant cries of "son of a . . ." and "holy schnike!" are extremely irritating and it's hard to see how the manic, stupid, childish character that he plays could ever win anyone over, let alone get to spend some quality time with Julie Warner (who plays Michelle, a co-worker and potential love interest). David Spade - now THAT guy is funny. His delivery of insulting one-liners is practically perfect and you understand his growing frustration as things get worse and worse for him. Dennehy is good enough, Bo Derek lends her beauty and Rob Lowe gets some laughs as his character goes through a number of mishaps. There's also an amusing small turn from Dan Aykroyd as Zalinsky, a big competitor who has offered to buy the business. It rattles along at a decent pace, keeps things relatively light and breezy and throws some good songs on the soundtrack (the moments with Farley and Spade singing together as they drive across the country are, I must say, actually pretty damn funny) but the central character just isn't likable enough to carry the whole thing. Dumb can be funny but the sweetness or innocence at the centre has to be played just right or it doesn't work. In Dumb & Dumber, for example, we had the two leads who never once considered how they appeared to others with their childish exuberance and juvenile antics. Here in Tommy Boy we get the occasional moment clumsily shoe-horned in there to show that Tommy has feelings too. It just doesn't work, somehow, but there are still plenty of laughs to be had throughout the film and fans of Farley can easily add a point or two.

    It's not a pure comedy. Yet well mixed with drama and romance. Even for it's old age it's defiantly a good movie. I didn't only laugh but "enjoyed" the movie. It has the right amount of romance and violent scenes. I would've given it 9/10 if I'd watched it in 1995. It starts lame but brings up the game as the movie goes on. It's important to point out that at some points while watching, you feel left-out with some unlinked scenes and phrases. Sometimes actions happen dramatically and doesn't make sense. But we can forgive it as the story is long enough and it would have been a 3 hours movie otherwise. I do recommend it to anyone feeling frustrated or just wants a relief. But it's not a movie to have fun and laugh watching. "It's a one to enjoy"

    There are only so many iconic funny films out there and this is one of them. People may think the film is stupid and has no message but I think as long as you can watch it over and over again and still think it's funny then it should be in the history books and worthy of my gratitude. How many films do you watch once and never watch again!!!! This is a tribute to Chris Farley and even Black sheep was brilliant but not as good, but I can still watch it over and over and be in stitches. David spade is absolutely brilliant also as is a very funny actor and comedian.My hat off to them both.RIP Chris Farley.

    Granted, I'm an avid Spade and Farley fan...but I cherish this movie. Light-hearted, slapstick humor, and the 90's Belushi and Ackroyd...how can you lose? It's not meant to be taken seriously, but it's unexpectedly heartwarming and hilarious to witness Spade and Farley as they were in real life...best friends and comrades. The chemistry is undeniable, and in addition to the wonderful duo are Rob Lowe, Brian Dennehy, Bo Derek, and Dan Ackroyd himself. If you love the Spade and Farley you've seen on Saturday Night Live, you'll appreciate this movie. I've seen it a million and one times, and it never gets old. It remains a classic in my house.

    Tommy is a slow-witted, clumsy guy who recently graduated college after attending for seven years. His father, Big Tom Callahan, owns an auto parts factory. When Tommy arrives home, he finds he has a position at the factory waiting for him. His dad also introduces Tommy to his soon-to-be stepmother, Beverly, and her son Paul. But when Big Tom dies, the factory threatens to go under unless new brake pads are sold. Tommy must go on the road to sell them, along with the assistance of Richard, Big Tom's right-hand man..... Here in England, this was the only Farley film that made it to the big screen, partly because at the time this sort of humour was deemed to immature for wide release. Now cinemas are rife with this stuff, thanks to the dumbing down of civilisation. It's throwaway stuff, and while the film lasts, it's okay. It would have been good to see if Farley would have become something, because his films were on a par with Sandlers at the time. Narrative is straight forward, and the whole point of the film is Farley falling over, being silly, and having crazy hair, while David Spade stands there and rolls his eyes. It's all predictable stuff, there is a point in the film, like every film like this, where they think all is lost, and then they redeem themselves. Forgettable, but slightly endearing.

    Dumb comedies and gross-outs don't do anything for me , usually doing the opposite and make me want to flick my eyeballs out with a sharp pencil. This mad, fast paced craze-fest is so infectiously delirious that it'd be inhuman not to warm to it and ultimately, rather like it. Or love it, though I'm not sure I want to go that far.... Chris Farley is a comic actor unknown to me, apart from his parts in Waynes World, which I saw so long ago, I cannot remember him. I understand that he was one of a kind and much loved. Comparisons with the Farrelly brothers cannot be dismissed, but Tommy Boy just seems less lame and crude and has more zest and genuine enthusiasm, by all in it. And I'm not sure that the Farrelly's could extend a script about brake pads over 90 minutes, either! It's good to see Dan Ackroyd and Bo Derek, Ackroyd himself being another great comic actor. David Spade I really don't know but he makes a great Laurel to Farley's modern day Hardy. Big on size, heart and character, was Mr Farley. Not one I'll be buying on DVD but did enjoy my seeing it on Sky Movies.

    The humor in Tommy Boy is nothing of high quality, and people shouldn't look at it as "the funniest film ever made." It's a mindless, joyous, rowdy ride through non-offensive material with two lead actors giving their all and forming simple and sincere chemistry. Now how can you hate a movie like that? The hate that this film has gotten is undeserving, really. It's nothing more than comedic fluff. Slapstick is a hard thing to achieve, and usually dumb laughs are the only thing a movie in this genre does achieve. Tommy Boy achieves great chemistry between two actors, good laughs, and sincere characters all in its short runtime. To begin with, when dealing with slapstick you need a likable, unoffensive star who is capable of being sweet and goofy. Farley just works. And he shows it explicitly here. Plot-wise, the film focuses on goofball Tommy Callahan III (Farley) who has just graduated College and is on to take over his father's company, Callahan Autos. His father (Dennehy) is about to get married again, but collapses and dies while dancing on his big night. Callahan Autos is trying to sell half a million brake pads, and now their time is shortened even more seeing as the death of their boss has left them very vulnerable. Tommy teams up with Richard (Spade), a goody two-shoes employee of his fathers who is jealous of Tommy's nice treatment and ability to be lackadaisical and be rewarded for it, to try and sell as many break pads to different companies across the US so they can make one last attempt to save the company. As you can imagine, the trip is where the duo are going to encounter the most antics. Some are funny, some are tone-deaf and go on for way too long. Tommy Boy does rip off some more successful films like the pool scene from National Lampoon's Vacation, but after a while, it begins to fade into the background and it's something that isn't obtrusive before long. This is a different kind of buddy comedy, because the buddies aren't really buddies, but rather, acquaintances. They're not two best friends hanging out, having fun on a road trip. One's antics leave the other one in a state of overwhelming disgust. Richard becomes Tommy's critic, smart-Alec self-conscious, and verbal abuser. In fact, Spade gets the most laughs out of everyone in the film. Farley is usually the but of every joke, as you'd expect. So maybe Farley isn't a good actor as much as he is a good punchline? Director Peter Segal also worked the camera when it was time to shoot Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult, so it's possible that a year later he'd like to spoof the buddy comedy genre by ultimately incorporating two characters who just simply tolerate each other for much of the film. Of course that is as far-fetched of an explanation I think I ever went for. Tommy Boy is funny and that's all there is to it. It's charming, creative, and works on the level it wants to. Starring: Chris Farley, David Spade, Bo Derek, Julie Warner, Dan Aykroyd, Brian Dennehy, and Rob Lowe (uncredited). Directed by: Peter Segal.

Tommy Boy achieves great chemistry between two actors, good laughs, and sincere characters all in its short runtime. To begin with, when dealing with slapstick you need a likable, unoffensive star who is capable of being sweet and goofy. Farley just works. And he shows it explicitly here. Plot-wise, the film focuses on goofball Tommy Callahan III (Farley) who has just graduated College and is on to take over his father's company, Callahan Autos. His father (Dennehy) is about to get married again, but collapses and dies while dancing on his big night. Callahan Autos is trying to sell half a million brake pads, and now their time is shortened even more seeing as the death of their boss has left them very vulnerable. Tommy teams up with Richard (Spade), a goody two-shoes employee of his fathers who is jealous of Tommy's nice treatment and ability to be lackadaisical and be rewarded for it, to try and sell as many break pads to different companies across the US so they can make one last attempt to save the company. As you can imagine, the trip is where the duo are going to encounter the most antics. Some are funny, some are tone-deaf and go on for way too long. Tommy Boy does rip off some more successful films like the pool scene from National Lampoon's Vacation, but after a while, it begins to fade into the background and it's something that isn't obtrusive before long. This is a different kind of buddy comedy, because the buddies aren't really buddies, but rather, acquaintances. They're not two best friends hanging out, having fun on a road trip. One's antics leave the other one in a state of overwhelming disgust. Richard becomes Tommy's critic, smart-Alec self-conscious, and verbal abuser. In fact, Spade gets the most laughs out of everyone in the film. Farley is usually the but of every joke, as you'd expect. So maybe Farley isn't a good actor as much as he is a good punchline? Director Peter Segal also worked the camera when it was time to shoot Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult, so it's possible that a year later he'd like to spoof the buddy comedy genre by ultimately incorporating two characters who just simply tolerate each other for much of the film. Of course that is as far-fetched of an explanation I think I ever went for. Tommy Boy is funny and that's all there is to it. It's charming, creative, and works on the level it wants to. Starring: Chris Farley, David Spade, Bo Derek, Julie Warner, Dan Aykroyd, Brian Dennehy, and Rob Lowe (uncredited). Directed by: Peter Segal.

    Tommy Boy Tommy boy is one of my all time favorite movies. Chris Farley and David Spade as a pair make laughter the norm. As is other big movies Peter Segal was the director of this movie. This 1995 movie has carved future movies into the dumb but funny category. Tommy being the clumsy guy as he is has finally graduated college after 7 years. His father "big Tom" owns an auto parts store in which Tommy has a job waiting for him on his arrival home. Big Tom introduces his new brake pad factory to Tommy and others. Big Tom at the time is about to get married which turns out to be a fraud. After the Marriage Big Toms die on stage of his reception. After loosing big Tom the factory is hurting. Tommy has now teamed up with Richard (David Spade) on a long journey to sell brake pads and keep the business afloat. All the actors in the movie played there act on spot. Tommy as the big dumb guy who can't ever be serious makes the whole movie funny. Richard, the book geek who is small and fearful. The movie was well rounded and not only kept you laughing but the story line also kept you interested. Some key video techniques can be found when the deer wakes up and destroys Richard's car. This deer completely destroys It which doesn't seem possible. After its done and the deer runs off Tommy pauses and says " I swear I've seen a lot of stuff in my day but that was.Awesome, but sorry about your car man, that sucks." A part in which the movie was made better is when Richard and Tommy are arguing what to listen to in the car, Tommy turns it to some old romantic song. They both say you can change it if you want, no one changes it and the next scene there both crying it and singing it to were Tommy almost wrecks the car. Overall the movie is a funny movie to watch and has many quote worthy lines in it. I think it was put together nicely and If only Farley was still here to keep the laughter going.

    This is a funny film - genuinely. It produces a few giggles and one or two howls of laughter. Chris Farley is great, as usual. Totally unique and talented. But he plays a really talentless young man in this film, who screws up everything. Skinny David Spade is the perfect choice as the exact opposite of the over-weight Farley. Things he says, especially some of his side remarks, are really quite amusing. The funniest scene is at the petrol station. I find that just hilarious. If you're looking for a 90 minute piece of half decent entertainment that is really simple to follow, then here is a film for you. It'll be cheap wherever you get it from.

    Chris Farley and David Spade star in the ultimate buddy picture that contains all the funny moments, and the heartwarming material. "Tommy Boy" takes place on Chris Farley going on an important business trip, taking the place of his deceased father, that can mean the jobs of everybody in Sandusky, with David Spade along for the ride. With a new family that could mean trouble that tries to bring down Callahan auto, Tommy must sell about half a million brake pads, before the factory goes under. Now, Chris Farley may bring too much energy, and turn into a maniac, but it's just way too funny, and the dynamic duo of Farley and Spade end up creating a hilarious chemistry between the two buddies, after working with each other on "Saturday Night Live". SNL creator Lorne Michaels has helped make the movie become an SNL sketch, or a long SNL sketch. So the movie was funny in every way, and the well-written wacky script felt so comedic and way deserving. From running over a dead deer, dancing in the gas station with cow crap all over, to Dan Aykroyd's incredible cameo role, "Tommy Boy" is a well-deserving laugh, and it's fun to never forget it. "Tommy Boy", in my review, "a well-deserved comedy from the minds of SNL".

    Chris Farley had a lot of fans. Well, despite his premature death he still has quite a lot of fans. With all due respect to the man, I'm not one of them. His best performance remains, for me, his fantastic turn as the man with no nose in the hilarious Dirty Work. Tommy Boy is, believe it or not, a kind of comedy riff on Hamlet. However, Shakespeare lovers may want to stay away from this one. The comedy begins as Tommy (Chris Farley) finally graduates after a ridiculously long time. He heads home to be with his father, big Tom (Brian Dennehy), and also meets his father's new bride (Bo Derek) and a troublemaker introduced as her son (Rob Lowe). All seems good for Tommy, not so good for Richard (David Spade), who has to act as an assistant to the buffoon when big Tom gives him an office and tries to get him learning the ropes of the family business. Richard has his work cut out for him when tragedy strikes and it's up to young Tommy to make sure the business stays solvent. Directed by Peter Segal, and with a decent script full of great barbs from Bonnie and Terry Turner, Tommy Boy could have been something very funny indeed. Instead, it relies too much on Farley's schtick, which can quickly become grating to those of us who aren't fans. His constant cries of "son of a . . ." and "holy schnike!" are extremely irritating and it's hard to see how the manic, stupid, childish character that he plays could ever win anyone over, let alone get to spend some quality time with Julie Warner (who plays Michelle, a co-worker and potential love interest). David Spade - now THAT guy is funny. His delivery of insulting one-liners is practically perfect and you understand his growing frustration as things get worse and worse for him. Dennehy is good enough, Bo Derek lends her beauty and Rob Lowe gets some laughs as his character goes through a number of mishaps. There's also an amusing small turn from Dan Aykroyd as Zalinsky, a big competitor who has offered to buy the business. It rattles along at a decent pace, keeps things relatively light and breezy and throws some good songs on the soundtrack (the moments with Farley and Spade singing together as they drive across the country are, I must say, actually pretty damn funny) but the central character just isn't likable enough to carry the whole thing. Dumb can be funny but the sweetness or innocence at the centre has to be played just right or it doesn't work. In Dumb & Dumber, for example, we had the two leads who never once considered how they appeared to others with their childish exuberance and juvenile antics. Here in Tommy Boy we get the occasional moment clumsily shoe-horned in there to show that Tommy has feelings too. It just doesn't work, somehow, but there are still plenty of laughs to be had throughout the film and fans of Farley can easily add a point or two.

    It's not a pure comedy. Yet well mixed with drama and romance. Even for it's old age it's defiantly a good movie. I didn't only laugh but "enjoyed" the movie. It has the right amount of romance and violent scenes. I would've given it 9/10 if I'd watched it in 1995. It starts lame but brings up the game as the movie goes on. It's important to point out that at some points while watching, you feel left-out with some unlinked scenes and phrases. Sometimes actions happen dramatically and doesn't make sense. But we can forgive it as the story is long enough and it would have been a 3 hours movie otherwise. I do recommend it to anyone feeling frustrated or just wants a relief. But it's not a movie to have fun and laugh watching. "It's a one to enjoy"

    There are only so many iconic funny films out there and this is one of them. People may think the film is stupid and has no message but I think as long as you can watch it over and over again and still think it's funny then it should be in the history books and worthy of my gratitude. How many films do you watch once and never watch again!!!! This is a tribute to Chris Farley and even Black sheep was brilliant but not as good, but I can still watch it over and over and be in stitches. David spade is absolutely brilliant also as is a very funny actor and comedian.My hat off to them both.RIP Chris Farley.

    Granted, I'm an avid Spade and Farley fan...but I cherish this movie. Light-hearted, slapstick humor, and the 90's Belushi and Ackroyd...how can you lose? It's not meant to be taken seriously, but it's unexpectedly heartwarming and hilarious to witness Spade and Farley as they were in real life...best friends and comrades. The chemistry is undeniable, and in addition to the wonderful duo are Rob Lowe, Brian Dennehy, Bo Derek, and Dan Ackroyd himself. If you love the Spade and Farley you've seen on Saturday Night Live, you'll appreciate this movie. I've seen it a million and one times, and it never gets old. It remains a classic in my house.

    Tommy is a slow-witted, clumsy guy who recently graduated college after attending for seven years. His father, Big Tom Callahan, owns an auto parts factory. When Tommy arrives home, he finds he has a position at the factory waiting for him. His dad also introduces Tommy to his soon-to-be stepmother, Beverly, and her son Paul. But when Big Tom dies, the factory threatens to go under unless new brake pads are sold. Tommy must go on the road to sell them, along with the assistance of Richard, Big Tom's right-hand man..... Here in England, this was the only Farley film that made it to the big screen, partly because at the time this sort of humour was deemed to immature for wide release. Now cinemas are rife with this stuff, thanks to the dumbing down of civilisation. It's throwaway stuff, and while the film lasts, it's okay. It would have been good to see if Farley would have become something, because his films were on a par with Sandlers at the time. Narrative is straight forward, and the whole point of the film is Farley falling over, being silly, and having crazy hair, while David Spade stands there and rolls his eyes. It's all predictable stuff, there is a point in the film, like every film like this, where they think all is lost, and then they redeem themselves. Forgettable, but slightly endearing.

    Dumb comedies and gross-outs don't do anything for me , usually doing the opposite and make me want to flick my eyeballs out with a sharp pencil. This mad, fast paced craze-fest is so infectiously delirious that it'd be inhuman not to warm to it and ultimately, rather like it. Or love it, though I'm not sure I want to go that far.... Chris Farley is a comic actor unknown to me, apart from his parts in Waynes World, which I saw so long ago, I cannot remember him. I understand that he was one of a kind and much loved. Comparisons with the Farrelly brothers cannot be dismissed, but Tommy Boy just seems less lame and crude and has more zest and genuine enthusiasm, by all in it. And I'm not sure that the Farrelly's could extend a script about brake pads over 90 minutes, either! It's good to see Dan Ackroyd and Bo Derek, Ackroyd himself being another great comic actor. David Spade I really don't know but he makes a great Laurel to Farley's modern day Hardy. Big on size, heart and character, was Mr Farley. Not one I'll be buying on DVD but did enjoy my seeing it on Sky Movies.

    The humor in Tommy Boy is nothing of high quality, and people shouldn't look at it as "the funniest film ever made." It's a mindless, joyous, rowdy ride through non-offensive material with two lead actors giving their all and forming simple and sincere chemistry. Now how can you hate a movie like that? The hate that this film has gotten is undeserving, really. It's nothing more than comedic fluff. Slapstick is a hard thing to achieve, and usually dumb laughs are the only thing a movie in this genre does achieve. Tommy Boy achieves great chemistry between two actors, good laughs, and sincere characters all in its short runtime. To begin with, when dealing with slapstick you need a likable, unoffensive star who is capable of being sweet and goofy. Farley just works. And he shows it explicitly here. Plot-wise, the film focuses on goofball Tommy Callahan III (Farley) who has just graduated College and is on to take over his father's company, Callahan Autos. His father (Dennehy) is about to get married again, but collapses and dies while dancing on his big night. Callahan Autos is trying to sell half a million brake pads, and now their time is shortened even more seeing as the death of their boss has left them very vulnerable. Tommy teams up with Richard (Spade), a goody two-shoes employee of his fathers who is jealous of Tommy's nice treatment and ability to be lackadaisical and be rewarded for it, to try and sell as many break pads to different companies across the US so they can make one last attempt to save the company. As you can imagine, the trip is where the duo are going to encounter the most antics. Some are funny, some are tone-deaf and go on for way too long. Tommy Boy does rip off some more successful films like the pool scene from National Lampoon's Vacation, but after a while, it begins to fade into the background and it's something that isn't obtrusive before long. This is a different kind of buddy comedy, because the buddies aren't really buddies, but rather, acquaintances. They're not two best friends hanging out, having fun on a road trip. One's antics leave the other one in a state of overwhelming disgust. Richard becomes Tommy's critic, smart-Alec self-conscious, and verbal abuser. In fact, Spade gets the most laughs out of everyone in the film. Farley is usually the but of every joke, as you'd expect. So maybe Farley isn't a good actor as much as he is a good punchline? Director Peter Segal also worked the camera when it was time to shoot Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult, so it's possible that a year later he'd like to spoof the buddy comedy genre by ultimately incorporating two characters who just simply tolerate each other for much of the film. Of course that is as far-fetched of an explanation I think I ever went for. Tommy Boy is funny and that's all there is to it. It's charming, creative, and works on the level it wants to.

Now cinemas are rife with this stuff, thanks to the dumbing down of civilisation. It's throwaway stuff, and while the film lasts, it's okay. It would have been good to see if Farley would have become something, because his films were on a par with Sandlers at the time. Narrative is straight forward, and the whole point of the film is Farley falling over, being silly, and having crazy hair, while David Spade stands there and rolls his eyes. It's all predictable stuff, there is a point in the film, like every film like this, where they think all is lost, and then they redeem themselves. Forgettable, but slightly endearing.

    Dumb comedies and gross-outs don't do anything for me , usually doing the opposite and make me want to flick my eyeballs out with a sharp pencil. This mad, fast paced craze-fest is so infectiously delirious that it'd be inhuman not to warm to it and ultimately, rather like it. Or love it, though I'm not sure I want to go that far.... Chris Farley is a comic actor unknown to me, apart from his parts in Waynes World, which I saw so long ago, I cannot remember him. I understand that he was one of a kind and much loved. Comparisons with the Farrelly brothers cannot be dismissed, but Tommy Boy just seems less lame and crude and has more zest and genuine enthusiasm, by all in it. And I'm not sure that the Farrelly's could extend a script about brake pads over 90 minutes, either! It's good to see Dan Ackroyd and Bo Derek, Ackroyd himself being another great comic actor. David Spade I really don't know but he makes a great Laurel to Farley's modern day Hardy. Big on size, heart and character, was Mr Farley. Not one I'll be buying on DVD but did enjoy my seeing it on Sky Movies.

    The humor in Tommy Boy is nothing of high quality, and people shouldn't look at it as "the funniest film ever made." It's a mindless, joyous, rowdy ride through non-offensive material with two lead actors giving their all and forming simple and sincere chemistry. Now how can you hate a movie like that? The hate that this film has gotten is undeserving, really. It's nothing more than comedic fluff. Slapstick is a hard thing to achieve, and usually dumb laughs are the only thing a movie in this genre does achieve. Tommy Boy achieves great chemistry between two actors, good laughs, and sincere characters all in its short runtime. To begin with, when dealing with slapstick you need a likable, unoffensive star who is capable of being sweet and goofy. Farley just works. And he shows it explicitly here. Plot-wise, the film focuses on goofball Tommy Callahan III (Farley) who has just graduated College and is on to take over his father's company, Callahan Autos. His father (Dennehy) is about to get married again, but collapses and dies while dancing on his big night. Callahan Autos is trying to sell half a million brake pads, and now their time is shortened even more seeing as the death of their boss has left them very vulnerable. Tommy teams up with Richard (Spade), a goody two-shoes employee of his fathers who is jealous of Tommy's nice treatment and ability to be lackadaisical and be rewarded for it, to try and sell as many break pads to different companies across the US so they can make one last attempt to save the company. As you can imagine, the trip is where the duo are going to encounter the most antics. Some are funny, some are tone-deaf and go on for way too long. Tommy Boy does rip off some more successful films like the pool scene from National Lampoon's Vacation, but after a while, it begins to fade into the background and it's something that isn't obtrusive before long. This is a different kind of buddy comedy, because the buddies aren't really buddies, but rather, acquaintances. They're not two best friends hanging out, having fun on a road trip. One's antics leave the other one in a state of overwhelming disgust. Richard becomes Tommy's critic, smart-Alec self-conscious, and verbal abuser. In fact, Spade gets the most laughs out of everyone in the film. Farley is usually the but of every joke, as you'd expect. So maybe Farley isn't a good actor as much as he is a good punchline? Director Peter Segal also worked the camera when it was time to shoot Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult, so it's possible that a year later he'd like to spoof the buddy comedy genre by ultimately incorporating two characters who just simply tolerate each other for much of the film. Of course that is as far-fetched of an explanation I think I ever went for. Tommy Boy is funny and that's all there is to it. It's charming, creative, and works on the level it wants to. Starring: Chris Farley, David Spade, Bo Derek, Julie Warner, Dan Aykroyd, Brian Dennehy, and Rob Lowe (uncredited). Directed by: Peter Segal.

    Tommy Boy Tommy boy is one of my all time favorite movies. Chris Farley and David Spade as a pair make laughter the norm. As is other big movies Peter Segal was the director of this movie. This 1995 movie has carved future movies into the dumb but funny category. Tommy being the clumsy guy as he is has finally graduated college after 7 years. His father "big Tom" owns an auto parts store in which Tommy has a job waiting for him on his arrival home. Big Tom introduces his new brake pad factory to Tommy and others. Big Tom at the time is about to get married which turns out to be a fraud. After the Marriage Big Toms die on stage of his reception. After loosing big Tom the factory is hurting. Tommy has now teamed up with Richard (David Spade) on a long journey to sell brake pads and keep the business afloat. All the actors in the movie played there act on spot. Tommy as the big dumb guy who can't ever be serious makes the whole movie funny. Richard, the book geek who is small and fearful. The movie was well rounded and not only kept you laughing but the story line also kept you interested. Some key video techniques can be found when the deer wakes up and destroys Richard's car. This deer completely destroys It which doesn't seem possible. After its done and the deer runs off Tommy pauses and says " I swear I've seen a lot of stuff in my day but that was.Awesome, but sorry about your car man, that sucks." A part in which the movie was made better is when Richard and Tommy are arguing what to listen to in the car, Tommy turns it to some old romantic song. They both say you can change it if you want, no one changes it and the next scene there both crying it and singing it to were Tommy almost wrecks the car. Overall the movie is a funny movie to watch and has many quote worthy lines in it. I think it was put together nicely and If only Farley was still here to keep the laughter going.

    This is a funny film - genuinely. It produces a few giggles and one or two howls of laughter. Chris Farley is great, as usual. Totally unique and talented. But he plays a really talentless young man in this film, who screws up everything. Skinny David Spade is the perfect choice as the exact opposite of the over-weight Farley. Things he says, especially some of his side remarks, are really quite amusing. The funniest scene is at the petrol station. I find that just hilarious. If you're looking for a 90 minute piece of half decent entertainment that is really simple to follow, then here is a film for you. It'll be cheap wherever you get it from.

    Chris Farley and David Spade star in the ultimate buddy picture that contains all the funny moments, and the heartwarming material. "Tommy Boy" takes place on Chris Farley going on an important business trip, taking the place of his deceased father, that can mean the jobs of everybody in Sandusky, with David Spade along for the ride. With a new family that could mean trouble that tries to bring down Callahan auto, Tommy must sell about half a million brake pads, before the factory goes under. Now, Chris Farley may bring too much energy, and turn into a maniac, but it's just way too funny, and the dynamic duo of Farley and Spade end up creating a hilarious chemistry between the two buddies, after working with each other on "Saturday Night Live". SNL creator Lorne Michaels has helped make the movie become an SNL sketch, or a long SNL sketch. So the movie was funny in every way, and the well-written wacky script felt so comedic and way deserving. From running over a dead deer, dancing in the gas station with cow crap all over, to Dan Aykroyd's incredible cameo role, "Tommy Boy" is a well-deserving laugh, and it's fun to never forget it. "Tommy Boy", in my review, "a well-deserved comedy from the minds of SNL".

    Chris Farley had a lot of fans. Well, despite his premature death he still has quite a lot of fans. With all due respect to the man, I'm not one of them. His best performance remains, for me, his fantastic turn as the man with no nose in the hilarious Dirty Work. Tommy Boy is, believe it or not, a kind of comedy riff on Hamlet. However, Shakespeare lovers may want to stay away from this one. The comedy begins as Tommy (Chris Farley) finally graduates after a ridiculously long time. He heads home to be with his father, big Tom (Brian Dennehy), and also meets his father's new bride (Bo Derek) and a troublemaker introduced as her son (Rob Lowe). All seems good for Tommy, not so good for Richard (David Spade), who has to act as an assistant to the buffoon when big Tom gives him an office and tries to get him learning the ropes of the family business. Richard has his work cut out for him when tragedy strikes and it's up to young Tommy to make sure the business stays solvent. Directed by Peter Segal, and with a decent script full of great barbs from Bonnie and Terry Turner, Tommy Boy could have been something very funny indeed. Instead, it relies too much on Farley's schtick, which can quickly become grating to those of us who aren't fans. His constant cries of "son of a . . ." and "holy schnike!" are extremely irritating and it's hard to see how the manic, stupid, childish character that he plays could ever win anyone over, let alone get to spend some quality time with Julie Warner (who plays Michelle, a co-worker and potential love interest). David Spade - now THAT guy is funny. His delivery of insulting one-liners is practically perfect and you understand his growing frustration as things get worse and worse for him. Dennehy is good enough, Bo Derek lends her beauty and Rob Lowe gets some laughs as his character goes through a number of mishaps. There's also an amusing small turn from Dan Aykroyd as Zalinsky, a big competitor who has offered to buy the business. It rattles along at a decent pace, keeps things relatively light and breezy and throws some good songs on the soundtrack (the moments with Farley and Spade singing together as they drive across the country are, I must say, actually pretty damn funny) but the central character just isn't likable enough to carry the whole thing. Dumb can be funny but the sweetness or innocence at the centre has to be played just right or it doesn't work. In Dumb & Dumber, for example, we had the two leads who never once considered how they appeared to others with their childish exuberance and juvenile antics. Here in Tommy Boy we get the occasional moment clumsily shoe-horned in there to show that Tommy has feelings too. It just doesn't work, somehow, but there are still plenty of laughs to be had throughout the film and fans of Farley can easily add a point or two.

    It's not a pure comedy. Yet well mixed with drama and romance. Even for it's old age it's defiantly a good movie. I didn't only laugh but "enjoyed" the movie. It has the right amount of romance and violent scenes. I would've given it 9/10 if I'd watched it in 1995. It starts lame but brings up the game as the movie goes on. It's important to point out that at some points while watching, you feel left-out with some unlinked scenes and phrases. Sometimes actions happen dramatically and doesn't make sense. But we can forgive it as the story is long enough and it would have been a 3 hours movie otherwise. I do recommend it to anyone feeling frustrated or just wants a relief. But it's not a movie to have fun and laugh watching. "It's a one to enjoy"

    There are only so many iconic funny films out there and this is one of them. People may think the film is stupid and has no message but I think as long as you can watch it over and over again and still think it's funny then it should be in the history books and worthy of my gratitude. How many films do you watch once and never watch again!!!! This is a tribute to Chris Farley and even Black sheep was brilliant but not as good, but I can still watch it over and over and be in stitches. David spade is absolutely brilliant also as is a very funny actor and comedian.My hat off to them both.RIP Chris Farley.

    Granted, I'm an avid Spade and Farley fan...but I cherish this movie. Light-hearted, slapstick humor, and the 90's Belushi and Ackroyd...how can you lose? It's not meant to be taken seriously, but it's unexpectedly heartwarming and hilarious to witness Spade and Farley as they were in real life...best friends and comrades. The chemistry is undeniable, and in addition to the wonderful duo are Rob Lowe, Brian Dennehy, Bo Derek, and Dan Ackroyd himself. If you love the Spade and Farley you've seen on Saturday Night Live, you'll appreciate this movie. I've seen it a million and one times, and it never gets old. It remains a classic in my house.

    Tommy is a slow-witted, clumsy guy who recently graduated college after attending for seven years. His father, Big Tom Callahan, owns an auto parts factory. When Tommy arrives home, he finds he has a position at the factory waiting for him. His dad also introduces Tommy to his soon-to-be stepmother, Beverly, and her son Paul. But when Big Tom dies, the factory threatens to go under unless new brake pads are sold. Tommy must go on the road to sell them, along with the assistance of Richard, Big Tom's right-hand man..... Here in England, this was the only Farley film that made it to the big screen, partly because at the time this sort of humour was deemed to immature for wide release. Now cinemas are rife with this stuff, thanks to the dumbing down of civilisation. It's throwaway stuff, and while the film lasts, it's okay. It would have been good to see if Farley would have become something, because his films were on a par with Sandlers at the time. Narrative is straight forward, and the whole point of the film is Farley falling over, being silly, and having crazy hair, while David Spade stands there and rolls his eyes. It's all predictable stuff, there is a point in the film, like every film like this, where they think all is lost, and then they redeem themselves. Forgettable, but slightly endearing.

    There are only so many iconic funny films out there and this is one of them. People may think the film is stupid and has no message but I think as long as you can watch it over and over again and still think it's funny then it should be in the history books and worthy of my gratitude. How many films do you watch once and never watch again!!!! This is a tribute to Chris Farley and even Black sheep was brilliant but not as good, but I can still watch it over and over and be in stitches. David spade is absolutely brilliant also as is a very funny actor and comedian.My hat off to them both.RIP Chris Farley.

    Granted, I'm an avid Spade and Farley fan...but I cherish this movie. Light-hearted, slapstick humor, and the 90's Belushi and Ackroyd...how can you lose? It's not meant to be taken seriously, but it's unexpectedly heartwarming and hilarious to witness Spade and Farley as they were in real life...best friends and comrades. The chemistry is undeniable, and in addition to the wonderful duo are Rob Lowe, Brian Dennehy, Bo Derek, and Dan Ackroyd himself. If you love the Spade and Farley you've seen on Saturday Night Live, you'll appreciate this movie. I've seen it a million and one times, and it never gets old. It remains a classic in my house.

    Tommy is a slow-witted, clumsy guy who recently graduated college after attending for seven years. His father, Big Tom Callahan, owns an auto parts factory. When Tommy arrives home, he finds he has a position at the factory waiting for him. His dad also introduces Tommy to his soon-to-be stepmother, Beverly, and her son Paul. But when Big Tom dies, the factory threatens to go under unless new brake pads are sold. Tommy must go on the road to sell them, along with the assistance of Richard, Big Tom's right-hand man..... Here in England, this was the only Farley film that made it to the big screen, partly because at the time this sort of humour was deemed to immature for wide release. Now cinemas are rife with this stuff, thanks to the dumbing down of civilisation. It's throwaway stuff, and while the film lasts, it's okay. It would have been good to see if Farley would have become something, because his films were on a par with Sandlers at the time. Narrative is straight forward, and the whole point of the film is Farley falling over, being silly, and having crazy hair, while David Spade stands there and rolls his eyes. It's all predictable stuff, there is a point in the film, like every film like this, where they think all is lost, and then they redeem themselves. Forgettable, but slightly endearing.

    Dumb comedies and gross-outs don't do anything for me , usually doing the opposite and make me want to flick my eyeballs out with a sharp pencil. This mad, fast paced craze-fest is so infectiously delirious that it'd be inhuman not to warm to it and ultimately, rather like it. Or love it, though I'm not sure I want to go that far.... Chris Farley is a comic actor unknown to me, apart from his parts in Waynes World, which I saw so long ago, I cannot remember him. I understand that he was one of a kind and much loved. Comparisons with the Farrelly brothers cannot be dismissed, but Tommy Boy just seems less lame and crude and has more zest and genuine enthusiasm, by all in it. And I'm not sure that the Farrelly's could extend a script about brake pads over 90 minutes, either! It's good to see Dan Ackroyd and Bo Derek, Ackroyd himself being another great comic actor. David Spade I really don't know but he makes a great Laurel to Farley's modern day Hardy. Big on size, heart and character, was Mr Farley. Not one I'll be buying on DVD but did enjoy my seeing it on Sky Movies.

    The humor in Tommy Boy is nothing of high quality, and people shouldn't look at it as "the funniest film ever made." It's a mindless, joyous, rowdy ride through non-offensive material with two lead actors giving their all and forming simple and sincere chemistry. Now how can you hate a movie like that? The hate that this film has gotten is undeserving, really. It's nothing more than comedic fluff. Slapstick is a hard thing to achieve, and usually dumb laughs are the only thing a movie in this genre does achieve. Tommy Boy achieves great chemistry between two actors, good laughs, and sincere characters all in its short runtime. To begin with, when dealing with slapstick you need a likable, unoffensive star who is capable of being sweet and goofy. Farley just works. And he shows it explicitly here. Plot-wise, the film focuses on goofball Tommy Callahan III (Farley) who has just graduated College and is on to take over his father's company, Callahan Autos. His father (Dennehy) is about to get married again, but collapses and dies while dancing on his big night. Callahan Autos is trying to sell half a million brake pads, and now their time is shortened even more seeing as the death of their boss has left them very vulnerable. Tommy teams up with Richard (Spade), a goody two-shoes employee of his fathers who is jealous of Tommy's nice treatment and ability to be lackadaisical and be rewarded for it, to try and sell as many break pads to different companies across the US so they can make one last attempt to save the company. As you can imagine, the trip is where the duo are going to encounter the most antics. Some are funny, some are tone-deaf and go on for way too long. Tommy Boy does rip off some more successful films like the pool scene from National Lampoon's Vacation, but after a while, it begins to fade into the background and it's something that isn't obtrusive before long. This is a different kind of buddy comedy, because the buddies aren't really buddies, but rather, acquaintances. They're not two best friends hanging out, having fun on a road trip. One's antics leave the other one in a state of overwhelming disgust. Richard becomes Tommy's critic, smart-Alec self-conscious, and verbal abuser. In fact, Spade gets the most laughs out of everyone in the film. Farley is usually the but of every joke, as you'd expect. So maybe Farley isn't a good actor as much as he is a good punchline? Director Peter Segal also worked the camera when it was time to shoot Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult, so it's possible that a year later he'd like to spoof the buddy comedy genre by ultimately incorporating two characters who just simply tolerate each other for much of the film. Of course that is as far-fetched of an explanation I think I ever went for. Tommy Boy is funny and that's all there is to it. It's charming, creative, and works on the level it wants to. Starring: Chris Farley, David Spade, Bo Derek, Julie Warner, Dan Aykroyd, Brian Dennehy, and Rob Lowe (uncredited). Directed by: Peter Segal.

    Tommy Boy Tommy boy is one of my all time favorite movies. Chris Farley and David Spade as a pair make laughter the norm. As is other big movies Peter Segal was the director of this movie. This 1995 movie has carved future movies into the dumb but funny category. Tommy being the clumsy guy as he is has finally graduated college after 7 years. His father "big Tom" owns an auto parts store in which Tommy has a job waiting for him on his arrival home. Big Tom introduces his new brake pad factory to Tommy and others. Big Tom at the time is about to get married which turns out to be a fraud. After the Marriage Big Toms die on stage of his reception. After loosing big Tom the factory is hurting. Tommy has now teamed up with Richard (David Spade) on a long journey to sell brake pads and keep the business afloat. All the actors in the movie played there act on spot. Tommy as the big dumb guy who can't ever be serious makes the whole movie funny. Richard, the book geek who is small and fearful. The movie was well rounded and not only kept you laughing but the story line also kept you interested. Some key video techniques can be found when the deer wakes up and destroys Richard's car. This deer completely destroys It which doesn't seem possible. After its done and the deer runs off Tommy pauses and says " I swear I've seen a lot of stuff in my day but that was.Awesome, but sorry about your car man, that sucks." A part in which the movie was made better is when Richard and Tommy are arguing what to listen to in the car, Tommy turns it to some old romantic song. They both say you can change it if you want, no one changes it and the next scene there both crying it and singing it to were Tommy almost wrecks the car. Overall the movie is a funny movie to watch and has many quote worthy lines in it. I think it was put together nicely and If only Farley was still here to keep the laughter going.

    This is a funny film - genuinely. It produces a few giggles and one or two howls of laughter. Chris Farley is great, as usual. Totally unique and talented. But he plays a really talentless young man in this film, who screws up everything. Skinny David Spade is the perfect choice as the exact opposite of the over-weight Farley. Things he says, especially some of his side remarks, are really quite amusing. The funniest scene is at the petrol station. I find that just hilarious. If you're looking for a 90 minute piece of half decent entertainment that is really simple to follow, then here is a film for you. It'll be cheap wherever you get it from.

    Chris Farley and David Spade star in the ultimate buddy picture that contains all the funny moments, and the heartwarming material. "Tommy Boy" takes place on Chris Farley going on an important business trip, taking the place of his deceased father, that can mean the jobs of everybody in Sandusky, with David Spade along for the ride. With a new family that could mean trouble that tries to bring down Callahan auto, Tommy must sell about half a million brake pads, before the factory goes under. Now, Chris Farley may bring too much energy, and turn into a maniac, but it's just way too funny, and the dynamic duo of Farley and Spade end up creating a hilarious chemistry between the two buddies, after working with each other on "Saturday Night Live". SNL creator Lorne Michaels has helped make the movie become an SNL sketch, or a long SNL sketch. So the movie was funny in every way, and the well-written wacky script felt so comedic and way deserving. From running over a dead deer, dancing in the gas station with cow crap all over, to Dan Aykroyd's incredible cameo role, "Tommy Boy" is a well-deserving laugh, and it's fun to never forget it. "Tommy Boy", in my review, "a well-deserved comedy from the minds of SNL".

    Chris Farley had a lot of fans. Well, despite his premature death he still has quite a lot of fans. With all due respect to the man, I'm not one of them. His best performance remains, for me, his fantastic turn as the man with no nose in the hilarious Dirty Work. Tommy Boy is, believe it or not, a kind of comedy riff on Hamlet. However, Shakespeare lovers may want to stay away from this one. The comedy begins as Tommy (Chris Farley) finally graduates after a ridiculously long time. He heads home to be with his father, big Tom (Brian Dennehy), and also meets his father's new bride (Bo Derek) and a troublemaker introduced as her son (Rob Lowe). All seems good for Tommy, not so good for Richard (David Spade), who has to act as an assistant to the buffoon when big Tom gives him an office and tries to get him learning the ropes of the family business. Richard has his work cut out for him when tragedy strikes and it's up to young Tommy to make sure the business stays solvent. Directed by Peter Segal, and with a decent script full of great barbs from Bonnie and Terry Turner, Tommy Boy could have been something very funny indeed. Instead, it relies too much on Farley's schtick, which can quickly become grating to those of us who aren't fans. His constant cries of "son of a . . ." and "holy schnike!" are extremely irritating and it's hard to see how the manic, stupid, childish character that he plays could ever win anyone over, let alone get to spend some quality time with Julie Warner (who plays Michelle, a co-worker and potential love interest). David Spade - now THAT guy is funny. His delivery of insulting one-liners is practically perfect and you understand his growing frustration as things get worse and worse for him. Dennehy is good enough, Bo Derek lends her beauty and Rob Lowe gets some laughs as his character goes through a number of mishaps. There's also an amusing small turn from Dan Aykroyd as Zalinsky, a big competitor who has offered to buy the business. It rattles along at a decent pace, keeps things relatively light and breezy and throws some good songs on the soundtrack (the moments with Farley and Spade singing together as they drive across the country are, I must say, actually pretty damn funny) but the central character just isn't likable enough to carry the whole thing. Dumb can be funny but the sweetness or innocence at the centre has to be played just right or it doesn't work. In Dumb & Dumber, for example, we had the two leads who never once considered how they appeared to others with their childish exuberance and juvenile antics. Here in Tommy Boy we get the occasional moment clumsily shoe-horned in there to show that Tommy has feelings too. It just doesn't work, somehow, but there are still plenty of laughs to be had throughout the film and fans of Farley can easily add a point or two.

    It's not a pure comedy. Yet well mixed with drama and romance. Even for it's old age it's defiantly a good movie. I didn't only laugh but "enjoyed" the movie. It has the right amount of romance and violent scenes. I would've given it 9/10 if I'd watched it in 1995. It starts lame but brings up the game as the movie goes on. It's important to point out that at some points while watching, you feel left-out with some unlinked scenes and phrases. Sometimes actions happen dramatically and doesn't make sense. But we can forgive it as the story is long enough and it would have been a 3 hours movie otherwise. I do recommend it to anyone feeling frustrated or just wants a relief.
