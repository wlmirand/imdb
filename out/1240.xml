    Before I start this review, remember I DID watch the subbed version, I did not watch the supposedly inferior English dub with supposedly worse dialogue and voice acting. Right off I get what is good at of the way. The action, as sparse as it was (About 4 violent scenes that last about 2 minutes each max), is amazing. The opening is one of the coolest scenes I have ever seen. The anime is incredibly well animated, and the character designs are fantastic. However, the anime has a multitude of problems in its writing. Characters are poorly written, and overly blunt. Ironically, this makes them seem almost robotic. The main character is a great example of this. She has a fitting voice actor choice, but has so poor dialogue it doesn't even matter if she is well voiced or not. It also helps that the lack of emotion in the main character (which is clearly intentional with her character design) would likely be pretty easy to voice act. Many of the scenes drag at far longer then they should, surprising in such a short movie, and fail to convey the philosophical discussion with any kind of subtly. The important scenes that drive the plot however seem to go so fast (and their not action scenes) that its like they made them last and ran out of budget right before beginning them. Then there is the random scenes with the amazing music showing stills of the cyberpunk world. While the music here was awesome, it seems the only reasons for their existence was to A. Extend the anime long enough to be considered a movie and B. Force feed you that this is an "Artsy" anime that's trying to be deep and meaningful, something it fails at both. The ending is the worst part in a fairly boring anime. While it ends after an extremely awesome scene, it feels like its has been setting up the anime for an interesting plot twist...only to execute it so badly and explain so little that it feels like that it wasn't even the twist and that actual twist will be reveal in 5-15 minutes...at which point the movie ends. And I am left stunned that this anime was ever considered a masterpiece. Especially since so little actually happened. I could explain the entire plot in three sentences without skimping on details. (Which I don't of course since putting spoilers in a review ruins the point of writing one) The poor writing and pacing of the story, and the way it tries to force feed the philosophical nature of the movie's themes causes the movie to be an utter disappointment and laborious experience. Its like they thought "We want to make a movie with philosophical themes, but we don't want to write a good story" causing it to feel like 'Babbies first philosophical movie' instead of 'Interesting and complex cyberpunk movie with philosophical undertones' like it should have been.

    Everys 20 or so years a filmmaker will just pull one out of his hat and stun everyone, and Ghost in the Shell is that film. I'd give it more than 10 out of 10 but this website won't let me. Animation of such rich detail and gorgeously done, this is eye-candy of the highest order, but it's not just flashing colours and big-eyed girls. The character and plot are adult and intelligent, and I'll bet most folks will benefit from multiple viewings. Days afterwards, you will still be troubled by the thoughts this film will generate. This is NOT for Disney fans or children, and will reward intelligent and smart adult audiences. Now, I've seen some fairly short reviews in here, but for some reason I am being hectored to type a minimum 10 lines.

    When you look up anim&eacute; movies, two movies will repeatedly get mentioned - Akira and Ghost In The Shell. And with good reason. This movie was a lot better than I had anticipated. I was expecting something like a Lara Croft: Tomb Raider kind of movie, but this was something else, thankfully. The year is 2029. The world has become intensively information oriented and humans are well-connected to the network. Crime has developed into a sophisticated stage by hacking into the interactive network. To prevent this, Section 9 is formed. These are cyborgs with incredible strengths and abilities that can access any network on Earth. This movie (directed by Mamoru Oshii) was the movie that was supposed to bring the anim&eacute; genre to the western audience, it failed at that, and I can understand why. Like the movie Cloud Atlas, this movie quickly becomes more complex than your average action flick and I think that this turns a lot of people off. The movie starts of as an action movie, but it quickly turns into a more philosophical piece. I was actually pretty intrigued by some of the movies philosophical questions, which I am not going to analyze in this review, but the main topic is; What makes a human? and more importantly, what makes a human an individual? The animation was good, though it is funny to see how much anim&eacute; styles change for each decade. You can just compare Ghost In The Shell (1995) with Ghost In The Shell 2 (2004) to notice the difference. The voice acting was also very good (I watched the Japanese version as I hate dubs, but some say that they also like the English version) I would also really like to give a shoutout Kenji Kawai(the music composer), this guy is awesome at making soundtracks. The cinematographer (Hisao Shirai) in this movie also does an awesome job, though I am not familiar with any of his other movies. Kenji Kawai and Hisao Shirai really elevates this movie to something else. The shots of the post-apocalyptic city along with the very haunting soundtrack was very intense. My only complaint about the movie is that I don't think it was long enough. It runs for 1:22 including credits, and there is definitely not any time wasted. The plot moves very fast, and so does the dialogue, which I thought was a shame because some of the dialouge really needed to sink in (for me at least), but it then quickly moves on to the next scene. Imo, this movie could have been a lot better with a running time of ~2 hours. Where we could have seen more of the city, and learned more about the status of the world which the movie only covers briefly. I don't know if the short running time is a deliberate choice made by the director, or if it is a matter of budget issues. I believe it is the latter, it is a little bit like (though not nearly as bad) as the new Berserk movies, in which they really amped up the animation quality, but they have also slaughtered more than 50% of the story that was in the original manga and anime. Overall great action, great animation, great voice acting, really great soundtrack, very nice cinematography, but a little too short imo. I highly recommend.

    Both of Oshii's main GitS movies are extremely stylish and enjoyable, but there is a LOT of really uncalled for nudity in this one. The GitS movies revolve around the concept that there are very human-like robots and cyborgs that inhabit the earth and that they have souls, called Ghosts, that inhabit their outer robot shells. These Ghosts can not only communicate with each other telepathically, but can switch shells, go on the equivalent of the internet, and be hacked, thus changing the reality that they experience. This movie follows a team of the once-organic female Major Kusanagi and the male Batou cyborg/robots as they track down a Ghost hacker called the "Puppet Master". Good times are had by all, the visuals have aged very well and still look better than a lot of what's currently out there. A must-see for anime movie fans.

    I didn't like Ghost in the Shell and found it very dry and incomprehensible. And this comes from a guy who loves Fire Walk with Me and Solaris. This film just annoyed me constantly with it's dry and boring dialog, silly philosophical lectures and borderline ridiculous visual symbolism's. I usually tend to like these art-house, style over substance films. Especially if they come from Asia, but watching Ghost in the Shell was just frustrating and unrewarding. You can call me stupid and tell me, that I don't get it, all you want. Watching characters exchanging exposition in flat, static shots isn't entertaining. And listening to heavy handed philosophy isn't either. The plot was confusing and characters just felt lifeless and completely uninteresting. We spend time watching our lead characters boobs, pretty scenery and boring characters talking about the plot. Ghost in the Shell is a poor example at visual storytelling and shoving scenes with symbolic images doesn't make it good or compelling. There were some things that I liked in it. The visuals and designs were gorgeous. The attention to detail and the fluid animation mixed with the visuals created beautiful atmosphere. I watched the original Japanese dub and it was good. But nothing of that really matters when the story is so frustrating and has so much pretentious crap in it that Terrence Malick would be proud. Go and see Ghost in the Shell and examine it for yourselves. Like all art-house films, this will create a different reaction from it's audience members. Some might hate it and others will love it. I didn't enjoy it and if you want a more straight forward science fiction anime or film for that matter, go watch Moon, Children of Men, Dark City or even Matrix. And as for me, I will stick to Blade Runner, thank you very much...

    This is a review of "Ghost in the Shell" and "Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence", two animated films by Mamouru Oshii. The titles of both films allude to the "ghost in the machine", philosopher Gilbert Ryle's description of Descartes' mind-body dualism. Both films spend much of their time drawing parallels between animals, pets, simple machines, human beings, augmented humans, cyborgs, computers and robots. Oshii then uses these parallels to introduce various questions regarding hard and soft free-will, predestination and nascent intelligence. Bored yet? Today many neuroscientists are quite happy to cast away the notion of both hard freewill and the Sovereign Self. Indeed, many recent experiments are starting to show that a large number of human activities, actions, thought processes etc are preconscious; they occur before we consciously decide to do them. To many eliminativist philosophers, The Self, what you think of as a free, independent agent, is but a phenomenal self model (an accidental byproduct of our senses) whose content is not innate but impersonally programmed by extrinsic sources. It's a relatively recently "built" neurocomputational model - not a soul or mental or coherent essence - which mistakes itself for an uncaused causer capable of initiating causal chains. Free-will is interpreted in a similarly reductionist light; man is not a free agent but a machine programmed or buffeted by a host of invisible triggers (social, external, environmental, biological, neurological, genetic, cultural, language etc), all of which are responsible for his actions, thoughts and subjective content. If the Self is Other, than Will is likewise. To Eastern religions, this is hardly radical. Indeed, the major religions of both the East and the West can be seen as a response to the Self. Very broadly speaking, Western monotheistic religions assert the existence of a God whose authority, strength, demands and wisdom keep the Self concrete, whereas Eastern religions try to weaken these ideas, and stress a kind of depersonalisation, or collapsing of all barriers. One side's ego boosting (you're real, you matter, free choice, a preoccupation with acquisition etc), one seeks ego death (self as illusion, let go, illusionary self, no bodies, only interconnected matter etc). Giving up the former idea is like man's rejection of geocentricism. When people started to see the earth as just another moving object, man was essentially displaced from the centre of the universe. Many were unsettled and alarmed by this idea. The status quo actively suppressed the Copernican revolution. Today the idea's accepted and viewed as being liberating and empowering rather than a threat. Today it's the eliminativist mindset that's deemed abhorrent. To such scientists, consciousness is severely limited and self understanding is particularly delusional. We are conscious of but a morsel of our external world, and even less of our internal, mental worlds. Our "inner and outer experiences" are themselves neuro-simulations that have been evolutionary fashioned for survival value, rather than representational truthfulness. The implication is not only that there is no "we", and that our consciousness is not "ours", but that consciousness is itself unconscious, highly inept. Most of our explanations and understandings of others, things, people and environments are themselves delusional, self-aggrandising fictions. What we say, think, feel, perceive, and do are but the consequences of deterministic physical (electro-chemical) processes in our neurons, and our own motivations and "reasons" are oft misunderstood, or may not even exist at all. We never actually decide on any of our actions; rather, our sense of choice and decision, and the reasons and motivations we cite for what we do, are all post-hoc rationalisations of processes that happen mechanistically via electrochemical cause-and-effect. All our rationales, and all our values, are themselves nothing more than consolatory fictions. Suicidal yet? This is taking a certain form of reductionism, or empirical materialism, to its extreme (Metzinger etc), and while it is "correct", neurobiology and cognitive psychology are still not advanced enough to tell us quite how "correct" it all is. We know little about the processes of "decision making" and scientists are still constantly (Walter J Freeman, Damasio, John McCrone etc) trying to rehabilitate the idea of "choice", teasing out nuances between voluntary and involuntary processes. One interesting line of study involves Cotard's syndrome, a pathological condition which results in a kind of "ego disturbance". Sufferers are unable to run "self simulations" and are unable to "perceive themselves" as being the "centre of their consciousness". Cotard's patients thus think they are dead, or deny their own existence. They stop using personal pronounces (I, me etc), refer to themselves as "it", rationalise their own non-existence and begin to develop a machine-like emotional "flatness". This  a conscious subject denying its own existence  of course seems bizarre to most, but such a form of existence denial highlights how incredibly fickle our own concepts of self-hood and existence are. Indeed, Cotard's syndrome heavily resembles the spiritual experiences reportedly induced and experienced by shamans and mystics. In both cases, the result seems to be a transition from a phenomenal self model (a simulational model with an "I" reference point), or subject model, to an object model (a decentralised simulation); a shift from a first person perspective to first-object perspective, in which the phenomenal property of "mineness" disappears from the patient's reality. This loss is theorised to be caused by either an extreme suppression of emotions, or a "glitch" which results in both affectlessness and, bizarrely, a replacement of "self concern" with something the patients describe as being "egoless" and "bigger". Studies also demonstrate that an increased awareness of the self-model as a model has the effect of making the self seem less real, which of course is akin to a scientific proof of a kind "spiritual enlightenment" (ie dissolution of the self). 8.5/10 - "Shell 1's" more of a traditional action-anime, whilst Oshii cites Antonioni and Godard as an influence on "Shell 2".

    Well, where do I start? Let me begin by saying that this is the one and only film that I've watched twice, in a row. Directly after each other (!). Since then I have watched Ghost in the Shell many times again, at least 20 times. This may sound a bit crazy, but the film is of such depth, with such a complex story, that you have to be very attentive to get the whole story, and it's quite impossible to fully understand the movie after one viewing. (especially when you watch it with subtitles) In fact, not all plots in the movie have tied up ends, which makes the film all the more intriguing. The main reason I've had multiple viewings, is, well, because it's art. I'm a fan of science-fiction, especially the intelligent kind, and I like manga, and this movie is the best in its genre. The artwork is sublime, with incredible detail. The music is mesmerizingly beautiful, and fits the existential atmosphere perfectly. The story is based on the book of Masamune Shirow, who deserves a lot of credit, for coming up with all these original ideas (the fingers that type the code!, to mention one). There's a lot of philosophy in it, enough to keep a few discussions at the pub going. At last a lot of credit goes to Mamoru Oshii, the director, for the intelligent script, excellent editing and infusion of Weltschmertz and existentialism. It's been a while since I've seen Ghost in the Shell, and there's only one reason for it: I've lent my copy to a friend. Can't wait to watch it again! Watching Ghost in the Shell is like going to church for me, the good kind :-) Enjoy the movie!

    Mamoru Oshii's Ghost in the Shell is a science fiction anime film that raised the bar for Japanese animation. Its complex woven narrative is set in a society where being a full-flesh human is no longer the norm. Is humanity losing its existence or is it loosely defined? Cyborgs are part human, part machine, and a continuation of a previously "whole" human entity. Major Motoko Kusanagi, a full-replacement cyborg in the national security division Section 9, is investigating a mysterious hacker who goes by the name "The Puppet Master." It may be apparent throughout the film that many of its aspects and ideas have been borrowed for other films such as The Matrix (source code; plugging into the network) and Inception (diving into another's conscious). Ghost in the Shell's portrayal of the significant role of networking in society appears strange and exaggerated to us but carries with it a strong familiarity and subtle message. Our reliance on networking is similarly demonstrated in The Matrix, but GITS takes it beyond questioning the basis of reality by turning to the self. The dualistic nature of mankind's existence is so prominently explored that it is reflected by the film's title itself. Physical vs. metaphysical mind vs. body the ghost vs. the shell. Cartesian dualism is a theory that the mind and body interact yet remain distinct from one another. Major Kusanagi contemplates what determines the identity of an individual. What defines life? Almost entirely artificially constructed, she questions her own existence. Is the ghost distinct from the shell? When someone is ghost hacked, they no longer have memories. So is the ghost (a loose metaphor for mind) what defines the self? Her resolution is reached as she merges with the Puppet Master, who suggests that life is simply a component of the network of all things. After the merge, the major and hacker share one entity with a blueprint for regeneration and become an integral part of the network by achieving a higher consciousness. The chief of Section 6 refers to the Puppet Master as a self-preserving program to which the hacker objects that by that logic, the human genome is no different. The Puppet Master claims to be a ghost born "within the flow of information" and goes on to define life from a person's memories. Ghost in the Shell manages to mix seamlessly integrated CGI and hand drawn animation, a complex but fitting plot, a resonant score, intermittent action sequences (complete with thermoptic camouflage!), and heavy philosophy (without being preachy) into an 82 minute runtime to make for a profound experience with loads of replay value.

    Ghost in the Shell is one of the ultimate nerd movies. A science fiction anime aimed at smart audiences. It's fundamentally about artificial intelligence and how human can be an individual that is mostly synthetic. At slightly over 80 minutes the movie is rather short and the story is rather simple, more of a short philosophical comment on what means to be human and life form, not a simple machine. The film follows a cyborg, major Kusanagi, which works for the police to track down an international criminal, which is initially though to be an American hacker but soon it is revealed to be something entirely different. I wouldn't say what it is to not spoil the film. My favorite thing about this movie was the amazing quality of the animation: it was hugely detailed and of excellent quality, among the best ever seem. A very good movie, highly recommended for science fiction fans.

    If you have not seen this anime go out, right now, and buy it. I can not implore you enough. To start off, the artistic style is amazing. I have not seen a anime that except for Akita(By the way see that too) that brought me to such emotion except for this. secondly the characters and dialog are three dimensional the are as complex as real human beings. And lastly, the story. What I can say about this story is only barred by a character limit. The ideas and messages of this anime are philosophical! The ideas of what life truly is was questioned. The idea that we have a soul is questioned. The story is as complex as the characters that star in it. several times i felt like i was watching a movie written by one of the grate Greek philosophers! Yeah, it is that good. it is so complex that you have to watch it several times just to understand half of it!

I don't know if the short running time is a deliberate choice made by the director, or if it is a matter of budget issues. I believe it is the latter, it is a little bit like (though not nearly as bad) as the new Berserk movies, in which they really amped up the animation quality, but they have also slaughtered more than 50% of the story that was in the original manga and anime. Overall great action, great animation, great voice acting, really great soundtrack, very nice cinematography, but a little too short imo. I highly recommend.

    Both of Oshii's main GitS movies are extremely stylish and enjoyable, but there is a LOT of really uncalled for nudity in this one. The GitS movies revolve around the concept that there are very human-like robots and cyborgs that inhabit the earth and that they have souls, called Ghosts, that inhabit their outer robot shells. These Ghosts can not only communicate with each other telepathically, but can switch shells, go on the equivalent of the internet, and be hacked, thus changing the reality that they experience. This movie follows a team of the once-organic female Major Kusanagi and the male Batou cyborg/robots as they track down a Ghost hacker called the "Puppet Master". Good times are had by all, the visuals have aged very well and still look better than a lot of what's currently out there. A must-see for anime movie fans.

    I didn't like Ghost in the Shell and found it very dry and incomprehensible. And this comes from a guy who loves Fire Walk with Me and Solaris. This film just annoyed me constantly with it's dry and boring dialog, silly philosophical lectures and borderline ridiculous visual symbolism's. I usually tend to like these art-house, style over substance films. Especially if they come from Asia, but watching Ghost in the Shell was just frustrating and unrewarding. You can call me stupid and tell me, that I don't get it, all you want. Watching characters exchanging exposition in flat, static shots isn't entertaining. And listening to heavy handed philosophy isn't either. The plot was confusing and characters just felt lifeless and completely uninteresting. We spend time watching our lead characters boobs, pretty scenery and boring characters talking about the plot. Ghost in the Shell is a poor example at visual storytelling and shoving scenes with symbolic images doesn't make it good or compelling. There were some things that I liked in it. The visuals and designs were gorgeous. The attention to detail and the fluid animation mixed with the visuals created beautiful atmosphere. I watched the original Japanese dub and it was good. But nothing of that really matters when the story is so frustrating and has so much pretentious crap in it that Terrence Malick would be proud. Go and see Ghost in the Shell and examine it for yourselves. Like all art-house films, this will create a different reaction from it's audience members. Some might hate it and others will love it. I didn't enjoy it and if you want a more straight forward science fiction anime or film for that matter, go watch Moon, Children of Men, Dark City or even Matrix. And as for me, I will stick to Blade Runner, thank you very much...

    This is a review of "Ghost in the Shell" and "Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence", two animated films by Mamouru Oshii. The titles of both films allude to the "ghost in the machine", philosopher Gilbert Ryle's description of Descartes' mind-body dualism. Both films spend much of their time drawing parallels between animals, pets, simple machines, human beings, augmented humans, cyborgs, computers and robots. Oshii then uses these parallels to introduce various questions regarding hard and soft free-will, predestination and nascent intelligence. Bored yet? Today many neuroscientists are quite happy to cast away the notion of both hard freewill and the Sovereign Self. Indeed, many recent experiments are starting to show that a large number of human activities, actions, thought processes etc are preconscious; they occur before we consciously decide to do them. To many eliminativist philosophers, The Self, what you think of as a free, independent agent, is but a phenomenal self model (an accidental byproduct of our senses) whose content is not innate but impersonally programmed by extrinsic sources. It's a relatively recently "built" neurocomputational model - not a soul or mental or coherent essence - which mistakes itself for an uncaused causer capable of initiating causal chains. Free-will is interpreted in a similarly reductionist light; man is not a free agent but a machine programmed or buffeted by a host of invisible triggers (social, external, environmental, biological, neurological, genetic, cultural, language etc), all of which are responsible for his actions, thoughts and subjective content. If the Self is Other, than Will is likewise. To Eastern religions, this is hardly radical. Indeed, the major religions of both the East and the West can be seen as a response to the Self. Very broadly speaking, Western monotheistic religions assert the existence of a God whose authority, strength, demands and wisdom keep the Self concrete, whereas Eastern religions try to weaken these ideas, and stress a kind of depersonalisation, or collapsing of all barriers. One side's ego boosting (you're real, you matter, free choice, a preoccupation with acquisition etc), one seeks ego death (self as illusion, let go, illusionary self, no bodies, only interconnected matter etc). Giving up the former idea is like man's rejection of geocentricism. When people started to see the earth as just another moving object, man was essentially displaced from the centre of the universe. Many were unsettled and alarmed by this idea. The status quo actively suppressed the Copernican revolution. Today the idea's accepted and viewed as being liberating and empowering rather than a threat. Today it's the eliminativist mindset that's deemed abhorrent. To such scientists, consciousness is severely limited and self understanding is particularly delusional. We are conscious of but a morsel of our external world, and even less of our internal, mental worlds. Our "inner and outer experiences" are themselves neuro-simulations that have been evolutionary fashioned for survival value, rather than representational truthfulness. The implication is not only that there is no "we", and that our consciousness is not "ours", but that consciousness is itself unconscious, highly inept. Most of our explanations and understandings of others, things, people and environments are themselves delusional, self-aggrandising fictions. What we say, think, feel, perceive, and do are but the consequences of deterministic physical (electro-chemical) processes in our neurons, and our own motivations and "reasons" are oft misunderstood, or may not even exist at all. We never actually decide on any of our actions; rather, our sense of choice and decision, and the reasons and motivations we cite for what we do, are all post-hoc rationalisations of processes that happen mechanistically via electrochemical cause-and-effect. All our rationales, and all our values, are themselves nothing more than consolatory fictions. Suicidal yet? This is taking a certain form of reductionism, or empirical materialism, to its extreme (Metzinger etc), and while it is "correct", neurobiology and cognitive psychology are still not advanced enough to tell us quite how "correct" it all is. We know little about the processes of "decision making" and scientists are still constantly (Walter J Freeman, Damasio, John McCrone etc) trying to rehabilitate the idea of "choice", teasing out nuances between voluntary and involuntary processes. One interesting line of study involves Cotard's syndrome, a pathological condition which results in a kind of "ego disturbance". Sufferers are unable to run "self simulations" and are unable to "perceive themselves" as being the "centre of their consciousness". Cotard's patients thus think they are dead, or deny their own existence. They stop using personal pronounces (I, me etc), refer to themselves as "it", rationalise their own non-existence and begin to develop a machine-like emotional "flatness". This  a conscious subject denying its own existence  of course seems bizarre to most, but such a form of existence denial highlights how incredibly fickle our own concepts of self-hood and existence are. Indeed, Cotard's syndrome heavily resembles the spiritual experiences reportedly induced and experienced by shamans and mystics. In both cases, the result seems to be a transition from a phenomenal self model (a simulational model with an "I" reference point), or subject model, to an object model (a decentralised simulation); a shift from a first person perspective to first-object perspective, in which the phenomenal property of "mineness" disappears from the patient's reality. This loss is theorised to be caused by either an extreme suppression of emotions, or a "glitch" which results in both affectlessness and, bizarrely, a replacement of "self concern" with something the patients describe as being "egoless" and "bigger". Studies also demonstrate that an increased awareness of the self-model as a model has the effect of making the self seem less real, which of course is akin to a scientific proof of a kind "spiritual enlightenment" (ie dissolution of the self). 8.5/10 - "Shell 1's" more of a traditional action-anime, whilst Oshii cites Antonioni and Godard as an influence on "Shell 2".

    Well, where do I start? Let me begin by saying that this is the one and only film that I've watched twice, in a row. Directly after each other (!). Since then I have watched Ghost in the Shell many times again, at least 20 times. This may sound a bit crazy, but the film is of such depth, with such a complex story, that you have to be very attentive to get the whole story, and it's quite impossible to fully understand the movie after one viewing. (especially when you watch it with subtitles) In fact, not all plots in the movie have tied up ends, which makes the film all the more intriguing. The main reason I've had multiple viewings, is, well, because it's art. I'm a fan of science-fiction, especially the intelligent kind, and I like manga, and this movie is the best in its genre. The artwork is sublime, with incredible detail. The music is mesmerizingly beautiful, and fits the existential atmosphere perfectly. The story is based on the book of Masamune Shirow, who deserves a lot of credit, for coming up with all these original ideas (the fingers that type the code!, to mention one). There's a lot of philosophy in it, enough to keep a few discussions at the pub going. At last a lot of credit goes to Mamoru Oshii, the director, for the intelligent script, excellent editing and infusion of Weltschmertz and existentialism. It's been a while since I've seen Ghost in the Shell, and there's only one reason for it: I've lent my copy to a friend. Can't wait to watch it again! Watching Ghost in the Shell is like going to church for me, the good kind :-) Enjoy the movie!

    Mamoru Oshii's Ghost in the Shell is a science fiction anime film that raised the bar for Japanese animation. Its complex woven narrative is set in a society where being a full-flesh human is no longer the norm. Is humanity losing its existence or is it loosely defined? Cyborgs are part human, part machine, and a continuation of a previously "whole" human entity. Major Motoko Kusanagi, a full-replacement cyborg in the national security division Section 9, is investigating a mysterious hacker who goes by the name "The Puppet Master." It may be apparent throughout the film that many of its aspects and ideas have been borrowed for other films such as The Matrix (source code; plugging into the network) and Inception (diving into another's conscious). Ghost in the Shell's portrayal of the significant role of networking in society appears strange and exaggerated to us but carries with it a strong familiarity and subtle message. Our reliance on networking is similarly demonstrated in The Matrix, but GITS takes it beyond questioning the basis of reality by turning to the self. The dualistic nature of mankind's existence is so prominently explored that it is reflected by the film's title itself. Physical vs. metaphysical mind vs. body the ghost vs. the shell. Cartesian dualism is a theory that the mind and body interact yet remain distinct from one another. Major Kusanagi contemplates what determines the identity of an individual. What defines life? Almost entirely artificially constructed, she questions her own existence. Is the ghost distinct from the shell? When someone is ghost hacked, they no longer have memories. So is the ghost (a loose metaphor for mind) what defines the self? Her resolution is reached as she merges with the Puppet Master, who suggests that life is simply a component of the network of all things. After the merge, the major and hacker share one entity with a blueprint for regeneration and become an integral part of the network by achieving a higher consciousness. The chief of Section 6 refers to the Puppet Master as a self-preserving program to which the hacker objects that by that logic, the human genome is no different. The Puppet Master claims to be a ghost born "within the flow of information" and goes on to define life from a person's memories. Ghost in the Shell manages to mix seamlessly integrated CGI and hand drawn animation, a complex but fitting plot, a resonant score, intermittent action sequences (complete with thermoptic camouflage!), and heavy philosophy (without being preachy) into an 82 minute runtime to make for a profound experience with loads of replay value.

    Ghost in the Shell is one of the ultimate nerd movies. A science fiction anime aimed at smart audiences. It's fundamentally about artificial intelligence and how human can be an individual that is mostly synthetic. At slightly over 80 minutes the movie is rather short and the story is rather simple, more of a short philosophical comment on what means to be human and life form, not a simple machine. The film follows a cyborg, major Kusanagi, which works for the police to track down an international criminal, which is initially though to be an American hacker but soon it is revealed to be something entirely different. I wouldn't say what it is to not spoil the film. My favorite thing about this movie was the amazing quality of the animation: it was hugely detailed and of excellent quality, among the best ever seem. A very good movie, highly recommended for science fiction fans.

    If you have not seen this anime go out, right now, and buy it. I can not implore you enough. To start off, the artistic style is amazing. I have not seen a anime that except for Akita(By the way see that too) that brought me to such emotion except for this. secondly the characters and dialog are three dimensional the are as complex as real human beings. And lastly, the story. What I can say about this story is only barred by a character limit. The ideas and messages of this anime are philosophical! The ideas of what life truly is was questioned. The idea that we have a soul is questioned. The story is as complex as the characters that star in it. several times i felt like i was watching a movie written by one of the grate Greek philosophers! Yeah, it is that good. it is so complex that you have to watch it several times just to understand half of it!

    Before I start this review, remember I DID watch the subbed version, I did not watch the supposedly inferior English dub with supposedly worse dialogue and voice acting. Right off I get what is good at of the way. The action, as sparse as it was (About 4 violent scenes that last about 2 minutes each max), is amazing. The opening is one of the coolest scenes I have ever seen. The anime is incredibly well animated, and the character designs are fantastic. However, the anime has a multitude of problems in its writing. Characters are poorly written, and overly blunt. Ironically, this makes them seem almost robotic. The main character is a great example of this. She has a fitting voice actor choice, but has so poor dialogue it doesn't even matter if she is well voiced or not. It also helps that the lack of emotion in the main character (which is clearly intentional with her character design) would likely be pretty easy to voice act. Many of the scenes drag at far longer then they should, surprising in such a short movie, and fail to convey the philosophical discussion with any kind of subtly. The important scenes that drive the plot however seem to go so fast (and their not action scenes) that its like they made them last and ran out of budget right before beginning them. Then there is the random scenes with the amazing music showing stills of the cyberpunk world. While the music here was awesome, it seems the only reasons for their existence was to A. Extend the anime long enough to be considered a movie and B. Force feed you that this is an "Artsy" anime that's trying to be deep and meaningful, something it fails at both. The ending is the worst part in a fairly boring anime. While it ends after an extremely awesome scene, it feels like its has been setting up the anime for an interesting plot twist...only to execute it so badly and explain so little that it feels like that it wasn't even the twist and that actual twist will be reveal in 5-15 minutes...at which point the movie ends. And I am left stunned that this anime was ever considered a masterpiece. Especially since so little actually happened. I could explain the entire plot in three sentences without skimping on details. (Which I don't of course since putting spoilers in a review ruins the point of writing one) The poor writing and pacing of the story, and the way it tries to force feed the philosophical nature of the movie's themes causes the movie to be an utter disappointment and laborious experience. Its like they thought "We want to make a movie with philosophical themes, but we don't want to write a good story" causing it to feel like 'Babbies first philosophical movie' instead of 'Interesting and complex cyberpunk movie with philosophical undertones' like it should have been.

    Everys 20 or so years a filmmaker will just pull one out of his hat and stun everyone, and Ghost in the Shell is that film. I'd give it more than 10 out of 10 but this website won't let me. Animation of such rich detail and gorgeously done, this is eye-candy of the highest order, but it's not just flashing colours and big-eyed girls. The character and plot are adult and intelligent, and I'll bet most folks will benefit from multiple viewings. Days afterwards, you will still be troubled by the thoughts this film will generate. This is NOT for Disney fans or children, and will reward intelligent and smart adult audiences. Now, I've seen some fairly short reviews in here, but for some reason I am being hectored to type a minimum 10 lines.

    When you look up anim&eacute; movies, two movies will repeatedly get mentioned - Akira and Ghost In The Shell. And with good reason. This movie was a lot better than I had anticipated. I was expecting something like a Lara Croft: Tomb Raider kind of movie, but this was something else, thankfully. The year is 2029. The world has become intensively information oriented and humans are well-connected to the network. Crime has developed into a sophisticated stage by hacking into the interactive network. To prevent this, Section 9 is formed. These are cyborgs with incredible strengths and abilities that can access any network on Earth. This movie (directed by Mamoru Oshii) was the movie that was supposed to bring the anim&eacute; genre to the western audience, it failed at that, and I can understand why. Like the movie Cloud Atlas, this movie quickly becomes more complex than your average action flick and I think that this turns a lot of people off. The movie starts of as an action movie, but it quickly turns into a more philosophical piece. I was actually pretty intrigued by some of the movies philosophical questions, which I am not going to analyze in this review, but the main topic is; What makes a human? and more importantly, what makes a human an individual? The animation was good, though it is funny to see how much anim&eacute; styles change for each decade. You can just compare Ghost In The Shell (1995) with Ghost In The Shell 2 (2004) to notice the difference. The voice acting was also very good (I watched the Japanese version as I hate dubs, but some say that they also like the English version) I would also really like to give a shoutout Kenji Kawai(the music composer), this guy is awesome at making soundtracks. The cinematographer (Hisao Shirai) in this movie also does an awesome job, though I am not familiar with any of his other movies. Kenji Kawai and Hisao Shirai really elevates this movie to something else. The shots of the post-apocalyptic city along with the very haunting soundtrack was very intense. My only complaint about the movie is that I don't think it was long enough. It runs for 1:22 including credits, and there is definitely not any time wasted. The plot moves very fast, and so does the dialogue, which I thought was a shame because some of the dialouge really needed to sink in (for me at least), but it then quickly moves on to the next scene. Imo, this movie could have been a lot better with a running time of ~2 hours. Where we could have seen more of the city, and learned more about the status of the world which the movie only covers briefly. I don't know if the short running time is a deliberate choice made by the director, or if it is a matter of budget issues. I believe it is the latter, it is a little bit like (though not nearly as bad) as the new Berserk movies, in which they really amped up the animation quality, but they have also slaughtered more than 50% of the story that was in the original manga and anime. Overall great action, great animation, great voice acting, really great soundtrack, very nice cinematography, but a little too short imo. I highly recommend.

In both cases, the result seems to be a transition from a phenomenal self model (a simulational model with an "I" reference point), or subject model, to an object model (a decentralised simulation); a shift from a first person perspective to first-object perspective, in which the phenomenal property of "mineness" disappears from the patient's reality. This loss is theorised to be caused by either an extreme suppression of emotions, or a "glitch" which results in both affectlessness and, bizarrely, a replacement of "self concern" with something the patients describe as being "egoless" and "bigger". Studies also demonstrate that an increased awareness of the self-model as a model has the effect of making the self seem less real, which of course is akin to a scientific proof of a kind "spiritual enlightenment" (ie dissolution of the self). 8.5/10 - "Shell 1's" more of a traditional action-anime, whilst Oshii cites Antonioni and Godard as an influence on "Shell 2".

    Well, where do I start? Let me begin by saying that this is the one and only film that I've watched twice, in a row. Directly after each other (!). Since then I have watched Ghost in the Shell many times again, at least 20 times. This may sound a bit crazy, but the film is of such depth, with such a complex story, that you have to be very attentive to get the whole story, and it's quite impossible to fully understand the movie after one viewing. (especially when you watch it with subtitles) In fact, not all plots in the movie have tied up ends, which makes the film all the more intriguing. The main reason I've had multiple viewings, is, well, because it's art. I'm a fan of science-fiction, especially the intelligent kind, and I like manga, and this movie is the best in its genre. The artwork is sublime, with incredible detail. The music is mesmerizingly beautiful, and fits the existential atmosphere perfectly. The story is based on the book of Masamune Shirow, who deserves a lot of credit, for coming up with all these original ideas (the fingers that type the code!, to mention one). There's a lot of philosophy in it, enough to keep a few discussions at the pub going. At last a lot of credit goes to Mamoru Oshii, the director, for the intelligent script, excellent editing and infusion of Weltschmertz and existentialism. It's been a while since I've seen Ghost in the Shell, and there's only one reason for it: I've lent my copy to a friend. Can't wait to watch it again! Watching Ghost in the Shell is like going to church for me, the good kind :-) Enjoy the movie!

    Mamoru Oshii's Ghost in the Shell is a science fiction anime film that raised the bar for Japanese animation. Its complex woven narrative is set in a society where being a full-flesh human is no longer the norm. Is humanity losing its existence or is it loosely defined? Cyborgs are part human, part machine, and a continuation of a previously "whole" human entity. Major Motoko Kusanagi, a full-replacement cyborg in the national security division Section 9, is investigating a mysterious hacker who goes by the name "The Puppet Master." It may be apparent throughout the film that many of its aspects and ideas have been borrowed for other films such as The Matrix (source code; plugging into the network) and Inception (diving into another's conscious). Ghost in the Shell's portrayal of the significant role of networking in society appears strange and exaggerated to us but carries with it a strong familiarity and subtle message. Our reliance on networking is similarly demonstrated in The Matrix, but GITS takes it beyond questioning the basis of reality by turning to the self. The dualistic nature of mankind's existence is so prominently explored that it is reflected by the film's title itself. Physical vs. metaphysical mind vs. body the ghost vs. the shell. Cartesian dualism is a theory that the mind and body interact yet remain distinct from one another. Major Kusanagi contemplates what determines the identity of an individual. What defines life? Almost entirely artificially constructed, she questions her own existence. Is the ghost distinct from the shell? When someone is ghost hacked, they no longer have memories. So is the ghost (a loose metaphor for mind) what defines the self? Her resolution is reached as she merges with the Puppet Master, who suggests that life is simply a component of the network of all things. After the merge, the major and hacker share one entity with a blueprint for regeneration and become an integral part of the network by achieving a higher consciousness. The chief of Section 6 refers to the Puppet Master as a self-preserving program to which the hacker objects that by that logic, the human genome is no different. The Puppet Master claims to be a ghost born "within the flow of information" and goes on to define life from a person's memories. Ghost in the Shell manages to mix seamlessly integrated CGI and hand drawn animation, a complex but fitting plot, a resonant score, intermittent action sequences (complete with thermoptic camouflage!), and heavy philosophy (without being preachy) into an 82 minute runtime to make for a profound experience with loads of replay value.

    Ghost in the Shell is one of the ultimate nerd movies. A science fiction anime aimed at smart audiences. It's fundamentally about artificial intelligence and how human can be an individual that is mostly synthetic. At slightly over 80 minutes the movie is rather short and the story is rather simple, more of a short philosophical comment on what means to be human and life form, not a simple machine. The film follows a cyborg, major Kusanagi, which works for the police to track down an international criminal, which is initially though to be an American hacker but soon it is revealed to be something entirely different. I wouldn't say what it is to not spoil the film. My favorite thing about this movie was the amazing quality of the animation: it was hugely detailed and of excellent quality, among the best ever seem. A very good movie, highly recommended for science fiction fans.

    If you have not seen this anime go out, right now, and buy it. I can not implore you enough. To start off, the artistic style is amazing. I have not seen a anime that except for Akita(By the way see that too) that brought me to such emotion except for this. secondly the characters and dialog are three dimensional the are as complex as real human beings. And lastly, the story. What I can say about this story is only barred by a character limit. The ideas and messages of this anime are philosophical! The ideas of what life truly is was questioned. The idea that we have a soul is questioned. The story is as complex as the characters that star in it. several times i felt like i was watching a movie written by one of the grate Greek philosophers! Yeah, it is that good. it is so complex that you have to watch it several times just to understand half of it!

    Before I start this review, remember I DID watch the subbed version, I did not watch the supposedly inferior English dub with supposedly worse dialogue and voice acting. Right off I get what is good at of the way. The action, as sparse as it was (About 4 violent scenes that last about 2 minutes each max), is amazing. The opening is one of the coolest scenes I have ever seen. The anime is incredibly well animated, and the character designs are fantastic. However, the anime has a multitude of problems in its writing. Characters are poorly written, and overly blunt. Ironically, this makes them seem almost robotic. The main character is a great example of this. She has a fitting voice actor choice, but has so poor dialogue it doesn't even matter if she is well voiced or not. It also helps that the lack of emotion in the main character (which is clearly intentional with her character design) would likely be pretty easy to voice act. Many of the scenes drag at far longer then they should, surprising in such a short movie, and fail to convey the philosophical discussion with any kind of subtly. The important scenes that drive the plot however seem to go so fast (and their not action scenes) that its like they made them last and ran out of budget right before beginning them. Then there is the random scenes with the amazing music showing stills of the cyberpunk world. While the music here was awesome, it seems the only reasons for their existence was to A. Extend the anime long enough to be considered a movie and B. Force feed you that this is an "Artsy" anime that's trying to be deep and meaningful, something it fails at both. The ending is the worst part in a fairly boring anime. While it ends after an extremely awesome scene, it feels like its has been setting up the anime for an interesting plot twist...only to execute it so badly and explain so little that it feels like that it wasn't even the twist and that actual twist will be reveal in 5-15 minutes...at which point the movie ends. And I am left stunned that this anime was ever considered a masterpiece. Especially since so little actually happened. I could explain the entire plot in three sentences without skimping on details. (Which I don't of course since putting spoilers in a review ruins the point of writing one) The poor writing and pacing of the story, and the way it tries to force feed the philosophical nature of the movie's themes causes the movie to be an utter disappointment and laborious experience. Its like they thought "We want to make a movie with philosophical themes, but we don't want to write a good story" causing it to feel like 'Babbies first philosophical movie' instead of 'Interesting and complex cyberpunk movie with philosophical undertones' like it should have been.

    Everys 20 or so years a filmmaker will just pull one out of his hat and stun everyone, and Ghost in the Shell is that film. I'd give it more than 10 out of 10 but this website won't let me. Animation of such rich detail and gorgeously done, this is eye-candy of the highest order, but it's not just flashing colours and big-eyed girls. The character and plot are adult and intelligent, and I'll bet most folks will benefit from multiple viewings. Days afterwards, you will still be troubled by the thoughts this film will generate. This is NOT for Disney fans or children, and will reward intelligent and smart adult audiences. Now, I've seen some fairly short reviews in here, but for some reason I am being hectored to type a minimum 10 lines.

    When you look up anim&eacute; movies, two movies will repeatedly get mentioned - Akira and Ghost In The Shell. And with good reason. This movie was a lot better than I had anticipated. I was expecting something like a Lara Croft: Tomb Raider kind of movie, but this was something else, thankfully. The year is 2029. The world has become intensively information oriented and humans are well-connected to the network. Crime has developed into a sophisticated stage by hacking into the interactive network. To prevent this, Section 9 is formed. These are cyborgs with incredible strengths and abilities that can access any network on Earth. This movie (directed by Mamoru Oshii) was the movie that was supposed to bring the anim&eacute; genre to the western audience, it failed at that, and I can understand why. Like the movie Cloud Atlas, this movie quickly becomes more complex than your average action flick and I think that this turns a lot of people off. The movie starts of as an action movie, but it quickly turns into a more philosophical piece. I was actually pretty intrigued by some of the movies philosophical questions, which I am not going to analyze in this review, but the main topic is; What makes a human? and more importantly, what makes a human an individual? The animation was good, though it is funny to see how much anim&eacute; styles change for each decade. You can just compare Ghost In The Shell (1995) with Ghost In The Shell 2 (2004) to notice the difference. The voice acting was also very good (I watched the Japanese version as I hate dubs, but some say that they also like the English version) I would also really like to give a shoutout Kenji Kawai(the music composer), this guy is awesome at making soundtracks. The cinematographer (Hisao Shirai) in this movie also does an awesome job, though I am not familiar with any of his other movies. Kenji Kawai and Hisao Shirai really elevates this movie to something else. The shots of the post-apocalyptic city along with the very haunting soundtrack was very intense. My only complaint about the movie is that I don't think it was long enough. It runs for 1:22 including credits, and there is definitely not any time wasted. The plot moves very fast, and so does the dialogue, which I thought was a shame because some of the dialouge really needed to sink in (for me at least), but it then quickly moves on to the next scene. Imo, this movie could have been a lot better with a running time of ~2 hours. Where we could have seen more of the city, and learned more about the status of the world which the movie only covers briefly. I don't know if the short running time is a deliberate choice made by the director, or if it is a matter of budget issues. I believe it is the latter, it is a little bit like (though not nearly as bad) as the new Berserk movies, in which they really amped up the animation quality, but they have also slaughtered more than 50% of the story that was in the original manga and anime. Overall great action, great animation, great voice acting, really great soundtrack, very nice cinematography, but a little too short imo. I highly recommend.

    Both of Oshii's main GitS movies are extremely stylish and enjoyable, but there is a LOT of really uncalled for nudity in this one. The GitS movies revolve around the concept that there are very human-like robots and cyborgs that inhabit the earth and that they have souls, called Ghosts, that inhabit their outer robot shells. These Ghosts can not only communicate with each other telepathically, but can switch shells, go on the equivalent of the internet, and be hacked, thus changing the reality that they experience. This movie follows a team of the once-organic female Major Kusanagi and the male Batou cyborg/robots as they track down a Ghost hacker called the "Puppet Master". Good times are had by all, the visuals have aged very well and still look better than a lot of what's currently out there. A must-see for anime movie fans.

    I didn't like Ghost in the Shell and found it very dry and incomprehensible. And this comes from a guy who loves Fire Walk with Me and Solaris. This film just annoyed me constantly with it's dry and boring dialog, silly philosophical lectures and borderline ridiculous visual symbolism's. I usually tend to like these art-house, style over substance films. Especially if they come from Asia, but watching Ghost in the Shell was just frustrating and unrewarding. You can call me stupid and tell me, that I don't get it, all you want. Watching characters exchanging exposition in flat, static shots isn't entertaining. And listening to heavy handed philosophy isn't either. The plot was confusing and characters just felt lifeless and completely uninteresting. We spend time watching our lead characters boobs, pretty scenery and boring characters talking about the plot. Ghost in the Shell is a poor example at visual storytelling and shoving scenes with symbolic images doesn't make it good or compelling. There were some things that I liked in it. The visuals and designs were gorgeous. The attention to detail and the fluid animation mixed with the visuals created beautiful atmosphere. I watched the original Japanese dub and it was good. But nothing of that really matters when the story is so frustrating and has so much pretentious crap in it that Terrence Malick would be proud. Go and see Ghost in the Shell and examine it for yourselves. Like all art-house films, this will create a different reaction from it's audience members. Some might hate it and others will love it. I didn't enjoy it and if you want a more straight forward science fiction anime or film for that matter, go watch Moon, Children of Men, Dark City or even Matrix. And as for me, I will stick to Blade Runner, thank you very much...

    This is a review of "Ghost in the Shell" and "Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence", two animated films by Mamouru Oshii. The titles of both films allude to the "ghost in the machine", philosopher Gilbert Ryle's description of Descartes' mind-body dualism. Both films spend much of their time drawing parallels between animals, pets, simple machines, human beings, augmented humans, cyborgs, computers and robots. Oshii then uses these parallels to introduce various questions regarding hard and soft free-will, predestination and nascent intelligence. Bored yet? Today many neuroscientists are quite happy to cast away the notion of both hard freewill and the Sovereign Self. Indeed, many recent experiments are starting to show that a large number of human activities, actions, thought processes etc are preconscious; they occur before we consciously decide to do them. To many eliminativist philosophers, The Self, what you think of as a free, independent agent, is but a phenomenal self model (an accidental byproduct of our senses) whose content is not innate but impersonally programmed by extrinsic sources. It's a relatively recently "built" neurocomputational model - not a soul or mental or coherent essence - which mistakes itself for an uncaused causer capable of initiating causal chains. Free-will is interpreted in a similarly reductionist light; man is not a free agent but a machine programmed or buffeted by a host of invisible triggers (social, external, environmental, biological, neurological, genetic, cultural, language etc), all of which are responsible for his actions, thoughts and subjective content. If the Self is Other, than Will is likewise. To Eastern religions, this is hardly radical. Indeed, the major religions of both the East and the West can be seen as a response to the Self. Very broadly speaking, Western monotheistic religions assert the existence of a God whose authority, strength, demands and wisdom keep the Self concrete, whereas Eastern religions try to weaken these ideas, and stress a kind of depersonalisation, or collapsing of all barriers. One side's ego boosting (you're real, you matter, free choice, a preoccupation with acquisition etc), one seeks ego death (self as illusion, let go, illusionary self, no bodies, only interconnected matter etc). Giving up the former idea is like man's rejection of geocentricism. When people started to see the earth as just another moving object, man was essentially displaced from the centre of the universe. Many were unsettled and alarmed by this idea. The status quo actively suppressed the Copernican revolution. Today the idea's accepted and viewed as being liberating and empowering rather than a threat. Today it's the eliminativist mindset that's deemed abhorrent. To such scientists, consciousness is severely limited and self understanding is particularly delusional. We are conscious of but a morsel of our external world, and even less of our internal, mental worlds. Our "inner and outer experiences" are themselves neuro-simulations that have been evolutionary fashioned for survival value, rather than representational truthfulness. The implication is not only that there is no "we", and that our consciousness is not "ours", but that consciousness is itself unconscious, highly inept. Most of our explanations and understandings of others, things, people and environments are themselves delusional, self-aggrandising fictions. What we say, think, feel, perceive, and do are but the consequences of deterministic physical (electro-chemical) processes in our neurons, and our own motivations and "reasons" are oft misunderstood, or may not even exist at all. We never actually decide on any of our actions; rather, our sense of choice and decision, and the reasons and motivations we cite for what we do, are all post-hoc rationalisations of processes that happen mechanistically via electrochemical cause-and-effect. All our rationales, and all our values, are themselves nothing more than consolatory fictions. Suicidal yet? This is taking a certain form of reductionism, or empirical materialism, to its extreme (Metzinger etc), and while it is "correct", neurobiology and cognitive psychology are still not advanced enough to tell us quite how "correct" it all is. We know little about the processes of "decision making" and scientists are still constantly (Walter J Freeman, Damasio, John McCrone etc) trying to rehabilitate the idea of "choice", teasing out nuances between voluntary and involuntary processes. One interesting line of study involves Cotard's syndrome, a pathological condition which results in a kind of "ego disturbance". Sufferers are unable to run "self simulations" and are unable to "perceive themselves" as being the "centre of their consciousness". Cotard's patients thus think they are dead, or deny their own existence. They stop using personal pronounces (I, me etc), refer to themselves as "it", rationalise their own non-existence and begin to develop a machine-like emotional "flatness". This  a conscious subject denying its own existence  of course seems bizarre to most, but such a form of existence denial highlights how incredibly fickle our own concepts of self-hood and existence are. Indeed, Cotard's syndrome heavily resembles the spiritual experiences reportedly induced and experienced by shamans and mystics. In both cases, the result seems to be a transition from a phenomenal self model (a simulational model with an "I" reference point), or subject model, to an object model (a decentralised simulation); a shift from a first person perspective to first-object perspective, in which the phenomenal property of "mineness" disappears from the patient's reality. This loss is theorised to be caused by either an extreme suppression of emotions, or a "glitch" which results in both affectlessness and, bizarrely, a replacement of "self concern" with something the patients describe as being "egoless" and "bigger". Studies also demonstrate that an increased awareness of the self-model as a model has the effect of making the self seem less real, which of course is akin to a scientific proof of a kind "spiritual enlightenment" (ie dissolution of the self). 8.5/10 - "Shell 1's" more of a traditional action-anime, whilst Oshii cites Antonioni and Godard as an influence on "Shell 2".

However, the anime has a multitude of problems in its writing. Characters are poorly written, and overly blunt. Ironically, this makes them seem almost robotic. The main character is a great example of this. She has a fitting voice actor choice, but has so poor dialogue it doesn't even matter if she is well voiced or not. It also helps that the lack of emotion in the main character (which is clearly intentional with her character design) would likely be pretty easy to voice act. Many of the scenes drag at far longer then they should, surprising in such a short movie, and fail to convey the philosophical discussion with any kind of subtly. The important scenes that drive the plot however seem to go so fast (and their not action scenes) that its like they made them last and ran out of budget right before beginning them. Then there is the random scenes with the amazing music showing stills of the cyberpunk world. While the music here was awesome, it seems the only reasons for their existence was to A. Extend the anime long enough to be considered a movie and B. Force feed you that this is an "Artsy" anime that's trying to be deep and meaningful, something it fails at both. The ending is the worst part in a fairly boring anime. While it ends after an extremely awesome scene, it feels like its has been setting up the anime for an interesting plot twist...only to execute it so badly and explain so little that it feels like that it wasn't even the twist and that actual twist will be reveal in 5-15 minutes...at which point the movie ends. And I am left stunned that this anime was ever considered a masterpiece. Especially since so little actually happened. I could explain the entire plot in three sentences without skimping on details. (Which I don't of course since putting spoilers in a review ruins the point of writing one) The poor writing and pacing of the story, and the way it tries to force feed the philosophical nature of the movie's themes causes the movie to be an utter disappointment and laborious experience. Its like they thought "We want to make a movie with philosophical themes, but we don't want to write a good story" causing it to feel like 'Babbies first philosophical movie' instead of 'Interesting and complex cyberpunk movie with philosophical undertones' like it should have been.

    Everys 20 or so years a filmmaker will just pull one out of his hat and stun everyone, and Ghost in the Shell is that film. I'd give it more than 10 out of 10 but this website won't let me. Animation of such rich detail and gorgeously done, this is eye-candy of the highest order, but it's not just flashing colours and big-eyed girls. The character and plot are adult and intelligent, and I'll bet most folks will benefit from multiple viewings. Days afterwards, you will still be troubled by the thoughts this film will generate. This is NOT for Disney fans or children, and will reward intelligent and smart adult audiences. Now, I've seen some fairly short reviews in here, but for some reason I am being hectored to type a minimum 10 lines.

    When you look up anim&eacute; movies, two movies will repeatedly get mentioned - Akira and Ghost In The Shell. And with good reason. This movie was a lot better than I had anticipated. I was expecting something like a Lara Croft: Tomb Raider kind of movie, but this was something else, thankfully. The year is 2029. The world has become intensively information oriented and humans are well-connected to the network. Crime has developed into a sophisticated stage by hacking into the interactive network. To prevent this, Section 9 is formed. These are cyborgs with incredible strengths and abilities that can access any network on Earth. This movie (directed by Mamoru Oshii) was the movie that was supposed to bring the anim&eacute; genre to the western audience, it failed at that, and I can understand why. Like the movie Cloud Atlas, this movie quickly becomes more complex than your average action flick and I think that this turns a lot of people off. The movie starts of as an action movie, but it quickly turns into a more philosophical piece. I was actually pretty intrigued by some of the movies philosophical questions, which I am not going to analyze in this review, but the main topic is; What makes a human? and more importantly, what makes a human an individual? The animation was good, though it is funny to see how much anim&eacute; styles change for each decade. You can just compare Ghost In The Shell (1995) with Ghost In The Shell 2 (2004) to notice the difference. The voice acting was also very good (I watched the Japanese version as I hate dubs, but some say that they also like the English version) I would also really like to give a shoutout Kenji Kawai(the music composer), this guy is awesome at making soundtracks. The cinematographer (Hisao Shirai) in this movie also does an awesome job, though I am not familiar with any of his other movies. Kenji Kawai and Hisao Shirai really elevates this movie to something else. The shots of the post-apocalyptic city along with the very haunting soundtrack was very intense. My only complaint about the movie is that I don't think it was long enough. It runs for 1:22 including credits, and there is definitely not any time wasted. The plot moves very fast, and so does the dialogue, which I thought was a shame because some of the dialouge really needed to sink in (for me at least), but it then quickly moves on to the next scene. Imo, this movie could have been a lot better with a running time of ~2 hours. Where we could have seen more of the city, and learned more about the status of the world which the movie only covers briefly. I don't know if the short running time is a deliberate choice made by the director, or if it is a matter of budget issues. I believe it is the latter, it is a little bit like (though not nearly as bad) as the new Berserk movies, in which they really amped up the animation quality, but they have also slaughtered more than 50% of the story that was in the original manga and anime. Overall great action, great animation, great voice acting, really great soundtrack, very nice cinematography, but a little too short imo. I highly recommend.

    Both of Oshii's main GitS movies are extremely stylish and enjoyable, but there is a LOT of really uncalled for nudity in this one. The GitS movies revolve around the concept that there are very human-like robots and cyborgs that inhabit the earth and that they have souls, called Ghosts, that inhabit their outer robot shells. These Ghosts can not only communicate with each other telepathically, but can switch shells, go on the equivalent of the internet, and be hacked, thus changing the reality that they experience. This movie follows a team of the once-organic female Major Kusanagi and the male Batou cyborg/robots as they track down a Ghost hacker called the "Puppet Master". Good times are had by all, the visuals have aged very well and still look better than a lot of what's currently out there. A must-see for anime movie fans.

    I didn't like Ghost in the Shell and found it very dry and incomprehensible. And this comes from a guy who loves Fire Walk with Me and Solaris. This film just annoyed me constantly with it's dry and boring dialog, silly philosophical lectures and borderline ridiculous visual symbolism's. I usually tend to like these art-house, style over substance films. Especially if they come from Asia, but watching Ghost in the Shell was just frustrating and unrewarding. You can call me stupid and tell me, that I don't get it, all you want. Watching characters exchanging exposition in flat, static shots isn't entertaining. And listening to heavy handed philosophy isn't either. The plot was confusing and characters just felt lifeless and completely uninteresting. We spend time watching our lead characters boobs, pretty scenery and boring characters talking about the plot. Ghost in the Shell is a poor example at visual storytelling and shoving scenes with symbolic images doesn't make it good or compelling. There were some things that I liked in it. The visuals and designs were gorgeous. The attention to detail and the fluid animation mixed with the visuals created beautiful atmosphere. I watched the original Japanese dub and it was good. But nothing of that really matters when the story is so frustrating and has so much pretentious crap in it that Terrence Malick would be proud. Go and see Ghost in the Shell and examine it for yourselves. Like all art-house films, this will create a different reaction from it's audience members. Some might hate it and others will love it. I didn't enjoy it and if you want a more straight forward science fiction anime or film for that matter, go watch Moon, Children of Men, Dark City or even Matrix. And as for me, I will stick to Blade Runner, thank you very much...

    This is a review of "Ghost in the Shell" and "Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence", two animated films by Mamouru Oshii. The titles of both films allude to the "ghost in the machine", philosopher Gilbert Ryle's description of Descartes' mind-body dualism. Both films spend much of their time drawing parallels between animals, pets, simple machines, human beings, augmented humans, cyborgs, computers and robots. Oshii then uses these parallels to introduce various questions regarding hard and soft free-will, predestination and nascent intelligence. Bored yet? Today many neuroscientists are quite happy to cast away the notion of both hard freewill and the Sovereign Self. Indeed, many recent experiments are starting to show that a large number of human activities, actions, thought processes etc are preconscious; they occur before we consciously decide to do them. To many eliminativist philosophers, The Self, what you think of as a free, independent agent, is but a phenomenal self model (an accidental byproduct of our senses) whose content is not innate but impersonally programmed by extrinsic sources. It's a relatively recently "built" neurocomputational model - not a soul or mental or coherent essence - which mistakes itself for an uncaused causer capable of initiating causal chains. Free-will is interpreted in a similarly reductionist light; man is not a free agent but a machine programmed or buffeted by a host of invisible triggers (social, external, environmental, biological, neurological, genetic, cultural, language etc), all of which are responsible for his actions, thoughts and subjective content. If the Self is Other, than Will is likewise. To Eastern religions, this is hardly radical. Indeed, the major religions of both the East and the West can be seen as a response to the Self. Very broadly speaking, Western monotheistic religions assert the existence of a God whose authority, strength, demands and wisdom keep the Self concrete, whereas Eastern religions try to weaken these ideas, and stress a kind of depersonalisation, or collapsing of all barriers. One side's ego boosting (you're real, you matter, free choice, a preoccupation with acquisition etc), one seeks ego death (self as illusion, let go, illusionary self, no bodies, only interconnected matter etc). Giving up the former idea is like man's rejection of geocentricism. When people started to see the earth as just another moving object, man was essentially displaced from the centre of the universe. Many were unsettled and alarmed by this idea. The status quo actively suppressed the Copernican revolution. Today the idea's accepted and viewed as being liberating and empowering rather than a threat. Today it's the eliminativist mindset that's deemed abhorrent. To such scientists, consciousness is severely limited and self understanding is particularly delusional. We are conscious of but a morsel of our external world, and even less of our internal, mental worlds. Our "inner and outer experiences" are themselves neuro-simulations that have been evolutionary fashioned for survival value, rather than representational truthfulness. The implication is not only that there is no "we", and that our consciousness is not "ours", but that consciousness is itself unconscious, highly inept. Most of our explanations and understandings of others, things, people and environments are themselves delusional, self-aggrandising fictions. What we say, think, feel, perceive, and do are but the consequences of deterministic physical (electro-chemical) processes in our neurons, and our own motivations and "reasons" are oft misunderstood, or may not even exist at all. We never actually decide on any of our actions; rather, our sense of choice and decision, and the reasons and motivations we cite for what we do, are all post-hoc rationalisations of processes that happen mechanistically via electrochemical cause-and-effect. All our rationales, and all our values, are themselves nothing more than consolatory fictions. Suicidal yet? This is taking a certain form of reductionism, or empirical materialism, to its extreme (Metzinger etc), and while it is "correct", neurobiology and cognitive psychology are still not advanced enough to tell us quite how "correct" it all is. We know little about the processes of "decision making" and scientists are still constantly (Walter J Freeman, Damasio, John McCrone etc) trying to rehabilitate the idea of "choice", teasing out nuances between voluntary and involuntary processes. One interesting line of study involves Cotard's syndrome, a pathological condition which results in a kind of "ego disturbance". Sufferers are unable to run "self simulations" and are unable to "perceive themselves" as being the "centre of their consciousness". Cotard's patients thus think they are dead, or deny their own existence. They stop using personal pronounces (I, me etc), refer to themselves as "it", rationalise their own non-existence and begin to develop a machine-like emotional "flatness". This  a conscious subject denying its own existence  of course seems bizarre to most, but such a form of existence denial highlights how incredibly fickle our own concepts of self-hood and existence are. Indeed, Cotard's syndrome heavily resembles the spiritual experiences reportedly induced and experienced by shamans and mystics. In both cases, the result seems to be a transition from a phenomenal self model (a simulational model with an "I" reference point), or subject model, to an object model (a decentralised simulation); a shift from a first person perspective to first-object perspective, in which the phenomenal property of "mineness" disappears from the patient's reality. This loss is theorised to be caused by either an extreme suppression of emotions, or a "glitch" which results in both affectlessness and, bizarrely, a replacement of "self concern" with something the patients describe as being "egoless" and "bigger". Studies also demonstrate that an increased awareness of the self-model as a model has the effect of making the self seem less real, which of course is akin to a scientific proof of a kind "spiritual enlightenment" (ie dissolution of the self). 8.5/10 - "Shell 1's" more of a traditional action-anime, whilst Oshii cites Antonioni and Godard as an influence on "Shell 2".

    Well, where do I start? Let me begin by saying that this is the one and only film that I've watched twice, in a row. Directly after each other (!). Since then I have watched Ghost in the Shell many times again, at least 20 times. This may sound a bit crazy, but the film is of such depth, with such a complex story, that you have to be very attentive to get the whole story, and it's quite impossible to fully understand the movie after one viewing. (especially when you watch it with subtitles) In fact, not all plots in the movie have tied up ends, which makes the film all the more intriguing. The main reason I've had multiple viewings, is, well, because it's art. I'm a fan of science-fiction, especially the intelligent kind, and I like manga, and this movie is the best in its genre. The artwork is sublime, with incredible detail. The music is mesmerizingly beautiful, and fits the existential atmosphere perfectly. The story is based on the book of Masamune Shirow, who deserves a lot of credit, for coming up with all these original ideas (the fingers that type the code!, to mention one). There's a lot of philosophy in it, enough to keep a few discussions at the pub going. At last a lot of credit goes to Mamoru Oshii, the director, for the intelligent script, excellent editing and infusion of Weltschmertz and existentialism. It's been a while since I've seen Ghost in the Shell, and there's only one reason for it: I've lent my copy to a friend. Can't wait to watch it again! Watching Ghost in the Shell is like going to church for me, the good kind :-) Enjoy the movie!

    Mamoru Oshii's Ghost in the Shell is a science fiction anime film that raised the bar for Japanese animation. Its complex woven narrative is set in a society where being a full-flesh human is no longer the norm. Is humanity losing its existence or is it loosely defined? Cyborgs are part human, part machine, and a continuation of a previously "whole" human entity. Major Motoko Kusanagi, a full-replacement cyborg in the national security division Section 9, is investigating a mysterious hacker who goes by the name "The Puppet Master." It may be apparent throughout the film that many of its aspects and ideas have been borrowed for other films such as The Matrix (source code; plugging into the network) and Inception (diving into another's conscious). Ghost in the Shell's portrayal of the significant role of networking in society appears strange and exaggerated to us but carries with it a strong familiarity and subtle message. Our reliance on networking is similarly demonstrated in The Matrix, but GITS takes it beyond questioning the basis of reality by turning to the self. The dualistic nature of mankind's existence is so prominently explored that it is reflected by the film's title itself. Physical vs. metaphysical mind vs. body the ghost vs. the shell. Cartesian dualism is a theory that the mind and body interact yet remain distinct from one another. Major Kusanagi contemplates what determines the identity of an individual. What defines life? Almost entirely artificially constructed, she questions her own existence. Is the ghost distinct from the shell? When someone is ghost hacked, they no longer have memories. So is the ghost (a loose metaphor for mind) what defines the self? Her resolution is reached as she merges with the Puppet Master, who suggests that life is simply a component of the network of all things. After the merge, the major and hacker share one entity with a blueprint for regeneration and become an integral part of the network by achieving a higher consciousness. The chief of Section 6 refers to the Puppet Master as a self-preserving program to which the hacker objects that by that logic, the human genome is no different. The Puppet Master claims to be a ghost born "within the flow of information" and goes on to define life from a person's memories. Ghost in the Shell manages to mix seamlessly integrated CGI and hand drawn animation, a complex but fitting plot, a resonant score, intermittent action sequences (complete with thermoptic camouflage!), and heavy philosophy (without being preachy) into an 82 minute runtime to make for a profound experience with loads of replay value.

    Ghost in the Shell is one of the ultimate nerd movies. A science fiction anime aimed at smart audiences. It's fundamentally about artificial intelligence and how human can be an individual that is mostly synthetic. At slightly over 80 minutes the movie is rather short and the story is rather simple, more of a short philosophical comment on what means to be human and life form, not a simple machine. The film follows a cyborg, major Kusanagi, which works for the police to track down an international criminal, which is initially though to be an American hacker but soon it is revealed to be something entirely different. I wouldn't say what it is to not spoil the film. My favorite thing about this movie was the amazing quality of the animation: it was hugely detailed and of excellent quality, among the best ever seem. A very good movie, highly recommended for science fiction fans.

    If you have not seen this anime go out, right now, and buy it. I can not implore you enough. To start off, the artistic style is amazing. I have not seen a anime that except for Akita(By the way see that too) that brought me to such emotion except for this. secondly the characters and dialog are three dimensional the are as complex as real human beings. And lastly, the story. What I can say about this story is only barred by a character limit. The ideas and messages of this anime are philosophical! The ideas of what life truly is was questioned. The idea that we have a soul is questioned. The story is as complex as the characters that star in it. several times i felt like i was watching a movie written by one of the grate Greek philosophers! Yeah, it is that good. it is so complex that you have to watch it several times just to understand half of it!

We spend time watching our lead characters boobs, pretty scenery and boring characters talking about the plot. Ghost in the Shell is a poor example at visual storytelling and shoving scenes with symbolic images doesn't make it good or compelling. There were some things that I liked in it. The visuals and designs were gorgeous. The attention to detail and the fluid animation mixed with the visuals created beautiful atmosphere. I watched the original Japanese dub and it was good. But nothing of that really matters when the story is so frustrating and has so much pretentious crap in it that Terrence Malick would be proud. Go and see Ghost in the Shell and examine it for yourselves. Like all art-house films, this will create a different reaction from it's audience members. Some might hate it and others will love it. I didn't enjoy it and if you want a more straight forward science fiction anime or film for that matter, go watch Moon, Children of Men, Dark City or even Matrix. And as for me, I will stick to Blade Runner, thank you very much...

    This is a review of "Ghost in the Shell" and "Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence", two animated films by Mamouru Oshii. The titles of both films allude to the "ghost in the machine", philosopher Gilbert Ryle's description of Descartes' mind-body dualism. Both films spend much of their time drawing parallels between animals, pets, simple machines, human beings, augmented humans, cyborgs, computers and robots. Oshii then uses these parallels to introduce various questions regarding hard and soft free-will, predestination and nascent intelligence. Bored yet? Today many neuroscientists are quite happy to cast away the notion of both hard freewill and the Sovereign Self. Indeed, many recent experiments are starting to show that a large number of human activities, actions, thought processes etc are preconscious; they occur before we consciously decide to do them. To many eliminativist philosophers, The Self, what you think of as a free, independent agent, is but a phenomenal self model (an accidental byproduct of our senses) whose content is not innate but impersonally programmed by extrinsic sources. It's a relatively recently "built" neurocomputational model - not a soul or mental or coherent essence - which mistakes itself for an uncaused causer capable of initiating causal chains. Free-will is interpreted in a similarly reductionist light; man is not a free agent but a machine programmed or buffeted by a host of invisible triggers (social, external, environmental, biological, neurological, genetic, cultural, language etc), all of which are responsible for his actions, thoughts and subjective content. If the Self is Other, than Will is likewise. To Eastern religions, this is hardly radical. Indeed, the major religions of both the East and the West can be seen as a response to the Self. Very broadly speaking, Western monotheistic religions assert the existence of a God whose authority, strength, demands and wisdom keep the Self concrete, whereas Eastern religions try to weaken these ideas, and stress a kind of depersonalisation, or collapsing of all barriers. One side's ego boosting (you're real, you matter, free choice, a preoccupation with acquisition etc), one seeks ego death (self as illusion, let go, illusionary self, no bodies, only interconnected matter etc). Giving up the former idea is like man's rejection of geocentricism. When people started to see the earth as just another moving object, man was essentially displaced from the centre of the universe. Many were unsettled and alarmed by this idea. The status quo actively suppressed the Copernican revolution. Today the idea's accepted and viewed as being liberating and empowering rather than a threat. Today it's the eliminativist mindset that's deemed abhorrent. To such scientists, consciousness is severely limited and self understanding is particularly delusional. We are conscious of but a morsel of our external world, and even less of our internal, mental worlds. Our "inner and outer experiences" are themselves neuro-simulations that have been evolutionary fashioned for survival value, rather than representational truthfulness. The implication is not only that there is no "we", and that our consciousness is not "ours", but that consciousness is itself unconscious, highly inept. Most of our explanations and understandings of others, things, people and environments are themselves delusional, self-aggrandising fictions. What we say, think, feel, perceive, and do are but the consequences of deterministic physical (electro-chemical) processes in our neurons, and our own motivations and "reasons" are oft misunderstood, or may not even exist at all. We never actually decide on any of our actions; rather, our sense of choice and decision, and the reasons and motivations we cite for what we do, are all post-hoc rationalisations of processes that happen mechanistically via electrochemical cause-and-effect. All our rationales, and all our values, are themselves nothing more than consolatory fictions. Suicidal yet? This is taking a certain form of reductionism, or empirical materialism, to its extreme (Metzinger etc), and while it is "correct", neurobiology and cognitive psychology are still not advanced enough to tell us quite how "correct" it all is. We know little about the processes of "decision making" and scientists are still constantly (Walter J Freeman, Damasio, John McCrone etc) trying to rehabilitate the idea of "choice", teasing out nuances between voluntary and involuntary processes. One interesting line of study involves Cotard's syndrome, a pathological condition which results in a kind of "ego disturbance". Sufferers are unable to run "self simulations" and are unable to "perceive themselves" as being the "centre of their consciousness". Cotard's patients thus think they are dead, or deny their own existence. They stop using personal pronounces (I, me etc), refer to themselves as "it", rationalise their own non-existence and begin to develop a machine-like emotional "flatness". This  a conscious subject denying its own existence  of course seems bizarre to most, but such a form of existence denial highlights how incredibly fickle our own concepts of self-hood and existence are. Indeed, Cotard's syndrome heavily resembles the spiritual experiences reportedly induced and experienced by shamans and mystics. In both cases, the result seems to be a transition from a phenomenal self model (a simulational model with an "I" reference point), or subject model, to an object model (a decentralised simulation); a shift from a first person perspective to first-object perspective, in which the phenomenal property of "mineness" disappears from the patient's reality. This loss is theorised to be caused by either an extreme suppression of emotions, or a "glitch" which results in both affectlessness and, bizarrely, a replacement of "self concern" with something the patients describe as being "egoless" and "bigger". Studies also demonstrate that an increased awareness of the self-model as a model has the effect of making the self seem less real, which of course is akin to a scientific proof of a kind "spiritual enlightenment" (ie dissolution of the self). 8.5/10 - "Shell 1's" more of a traditional action-anime, whilst Oshii cites Antonioni and Godard as an influence on "Shell 2".

    Well, where do I start? Let me begin by saying that this is the one and only film that I've watched twice, in a row. Directly after each other (!). Since then I have watched Ghost in the Shell many times again, at least 20 times. This may sound a bit crazy, but the film is of such depth, with such a complex story, that you have to be very attentive to get the whole story, and it's quite impossible to fully understand the movie after one viewing. (especially when you watch it with subtitles) In fact, not all plots in the movie have tied up ends, which makes the film all the more intriguing. The main reason I've had multiple viewings, is, well, because it's art. I'm a fan of science-fiction, especially the intelligent kind, and I like manga, and this movie is the best in its genre. The artwork is sublime, with incredible detail. The music is mesmerizingly beautiful, and fits the existential atmosphere perfectly. The story is based on the book of Masamune Shirow, who deserves a lot of credit, for coming up with all these original ideas (the fingers that type the code!, to mention one). There's a lot of philosophy in it, enough to keep a few discussions at the pub going. At last a lot of credit goes to Mamoru Oshii, the director, for the intelligent script, excellent editing and infusion of Weltschmertz and existentialism. It's been a while since I've seen Ghost in the Shell, and there's only one reason for it: I've lent my copy to a friend. Can't wait to watch it again! Watching Ghost in the Shell is like going to church for me, the good kind :-) Enjoy the movie!

    Mamoru Oshii's Ghost in the Shell is a science fiction anime film that raised the bar for Japanese animation. Its complex woven narrative is set in a society where being a full-flesh human is no longer the norm. Is humanity losing its existence or is it loosely defined? Cyborgs are part human, part machine, and a continuation of a previously "whole" human entity. Major Motoko Kusanagi, a full-replacement cyborg in the national security division Section 9, is investigating a mysterious hacker who goes by the name "The Puppet Master." It may be apparent throughout the film that many of its aspects and ideas have been borrowed for other films such as The Matrix (source code; plugging into the network) and Inception (diving into another's conscious). Ghost in the Shell's portrayal of the significant role of networking in society appears strange and exaggerated to us but carries with it a strong familiarity and subtle message. Our reliance on networking is similarly demonstrated in The Matrix, but GITS takes it beyond questioning the basis of reality by turning to the self. The dualistic nature of mankind's existence is so prominently explored that it is reflected by the film's title itself. Physical vs. metaphysical mind vs. body the ghost vs. the shell. Cartesian dualism is a theory that the mind and body interact yet remain distinct from one another. Major Kusanagi contemplates what determines the identity of an individual. What defines life? Almost entirely artificially constructed, she questions her own existence. Is the ghost distinct from the shell? When someone is ghost hacked, they no longer have memories. So is the ghost (a loose metaphor for mind) what defines the self? Her resolution is reached as she merges with the Puppet Master, who suggests that life is simply a component of the network of all things. After the merge, the major and hacker share one entity with a blueprint for regeneration and become an integral part of the network by achieving a higher consciousness. The chief of Section 6 refers to the Puppet Master as a self-preserving program to which the hacker objects that by that logic, the human genome is no different. The Puppet Master claims to be a ghost born "within the flow of information" and goes on to define life from a person's memories. Ghost in the Shell manages to mix seamlessly integrated CGI and hand drawn animation, a complex but fitting plot, a resonant score, intermittent action sequences (complete with thermoptic camouflage!), and heavy philosophy (without being preachy) into an 82 minute runtime to make for a profound experience with loads of replay value.

    Ghost in the Shell is one of the ultimate nerd movies. A science fiction anime aimed at smart audiences. It's fundamentally about artificial intelligence and how human can be an individual that is mostly synthetic. At slightly over 80 minutes the movie is rather short and the story is rather simple, more of a short philosophical comment on what means to be human and life form, not a simple machine. The film follows a cyborg, major Kusanagi, which works for the police to track down an international criminal, which is initially though to be an American hacker but soon it is revealed to be something entirely different. I wouldn't say what it is to not spoil the film. My favorite thing about this movie was the amazing quality of the animation: it was hugely detailed and of excellent quality, among the best ever seem. A very good movie, highly recommended for science fiction fans.

    If you have not seen this anime go out, right now, and buy it. I can not implore you enough. To start off, the artistic style is amazing. I have not seen a anime that except for Akita(By the way see that too) that brought me to such emotion except for this. secondly the characters and dialog are three dimensional the are as complex as real human beings. And lastly, the story. What I can say about this story is only barred by a character limit. The ideas and messages of this anime are philosophical! The ideas of what life truly is was questioned. The idea that we have a soul is questioned. The story is as complex as the characters that star in it. several times i felt like i was watching a movie written by one of the grate Greek philosophers! Yeah, it is that good. it is so complex that you have to watch it several times just to understand half of it!

    Before I start this review, remember I DID watch the subbed version, I did not watch the supposedly inferior English dub with supposedly worse dialogue and voice acting. Right off I get what is good at of the way. The action, as sparse as it was (About 4 violent scenes that last about 2 minutes each max), is amazing. The opening is one of the coolest scenes I have ever seen. The anime is incredibly well animated, and the character designs are fantastic. However, the anime has a multitude of problems in its writing. Characters are poorly written, and overly blunt. Ironically, this makes them seem almost robotic. The main character is a great example of this. She has a fitting voice actor choice, but has so poor dialogue it doesn't even matter if she is well voiced or not. It also helps that the lack of emotion in the main character (which is clearly intentional with her character design) would likely be pretty easy to voice act. Many of the scenes drag at far longer then they should, surprising in such a short movie, and fail to convey the philosophical discussion with any kind of subtly. The important scenes that drive the plot however seem to go so fast (and their not action scenes) that its like they made them last and ran out of budget right before beginning them. Then there is the random scenes with the amazing music showing stills of the cyberpunk world. While the music here was awesome, it seems the only reasons for their existence was to A. Extend the anime long enough to be considered a movie and B. Force feed you that this is an "Artsy" anime that's trying to be deep and meaningful, something it fails at both. The ending is the worst part in a fairly boring anime. While it ends after an extremely awesome scene, it feels like its has been setting up the anime for an interesting plot twist...only to execute it so badly and explain so little that it feels like that it wasn't even the twist and that actual twist will be reveal in 5-15 minutes...at which point the movie ends. And I am left stunned that this anime was ever considered a masterpiece. Especially since so little actually happened. I could explain the entire plot in three sentences without skimping on details. (Which I don't of course since putting spoilers in a review ruins the point of writing one) The poor writing and pacing of the story, and the way it tries to force feed the philosophical nature of the movie's themes causes the movie to be an utter disappointment and laborious experience. Its like they thought "We want to make a movie with philosophical themes, but we don't want to write a good story" causing it to feel like 'Babbies first philosophical movie' instead of 'Interesting and complex cyberpunk movie with philosophical undertones' like it should have been.

    Everys 20 or so years a filmmaker will just pull one out of his hat and stun everyone, and Ghost in the Shell is that film. I'd give it more than 10 out of 10 but this website won't let me. Animation of such rich detail and gorgeously done, this is eye-candy of the highest order, but it's not just flashing colours and big-eyed girls. The character and plot are adult and intelligent, and I'll bet most folks will benefit from multiple viewings. Days afterwards, you will still be troubled by the thoughts this film will generate. This is NOT for Disney fans or children, and will reward intelligent and smart adult audiences. Now, I've seen some fairly short reviews in here, but for some reason I am being hectored to type a minimum 10 lines.

    When you look up anim&eacute; movies, two movies will repeatedly get mentioned - Akira and Ghost In The Shell. And with good reason. This movie was a lot better than I had anticipated. I was expecting something like a Lara Croft: Tomb Raider kind of movie, but this was something else, thankfully. The year is 2029. The world has become intensively information oriented and humans are well-connected to the network. Crime has developed into a sophisticated stage by hacking into the interactive network. To prevent this, Section 9 is formed. These are cyborgs with incredible strengths and abilities that can access any network on Earth. This movie (directed by Mamoru Oshii) was the movie that was supposed to bring the anim&eacute; genre to the western audience, it failed at that, and I can understand why. Like the movie Cloud Atlas, this movie quickly becomes more complex than your average action flick and I think that this turns a lot of people off. The movie starts of as an action movie, but it quickly turns into a more philosophical piece. I was actually pretty intrigued by some of the movies philosophical questions, which I am not going to analyze in this review, but the main topic is; What makes a human? and more importantly, what makes a human an individual? The animation was good, though it is funny to see how much anim&eacute; styles change for each decade. You can just compare Ghost In The Shell (1995) with Ghost In The Shell 2 (2004) to notice the difference. The voice acting was also very good (I watched the Japanese version as I hate dubs, but some say that they also like the English version) I would also really like to give a shoutout Kenji Kawai(the music composer), this guy is awesome at making soundtracks. The cinematographer (Hisao Shirai) in this movie also does an awesome job, though I am not familiar with any of his other movies. Kenji Kawai and Hisao Shirai really elevates this movie to something else. The shots of the post-apocalyptic city along with the very haunting soundtrack was very intense. My only complaint about the movie is that I don't think it was long enough. It runs for 1:22 including credits, and there is definitely not any time wasted. The plot moves very fast, and so does the dialogue, which I thought was a shame because some of the dialouge really needed to sink in (for me at least), but it then quickly moves on to the next scene. Imo, this movie could have been a lot better with a running time of ~2 hours. Where we could have seen more of the city, and learned more about the status of the world which the movie only covers briefly. I don't know if the short running time is a deliberate choice made by the director, or if it is a matter of budget issues. I believe it is the latter, it is a little bit like (though not nearly as bad) as the new Berserk movies, in which they really amped up the animation quality, but they have also slaughtered more than 50% of the story that was in the original manga and anime. Overall great action, great animation, great voice acting, really great soundtrack, very nice cinematography, but a little too short imo. I highly recommend.

    Both of Oshii's main GitS movies are extremely stylish and enjoyable, but there is a LOT of really uncalled for nudity in this one. The GitS movies revolve around the concept that there are very human-like robots and cyborgs that inhabit the earth and that they have souls, called Ghosts, that inhabit their outer robot shells. These Ghosts can not only communicate with each other telepathically, but can switch shells, go on the equivalent of the internet, and be hacked, thus changing the reality that they experience. This movie follows a team of the once-organic female Major Kusanagi and the male Batou cyborg/robots as they track down a Ghost hacker called the "Puppet Master". Good times are had by all, the visuals have aged very well and still look better than a lot of what's currently out there. A must-see for anime movie fans.

    I didn't like Ghost in the Shell and found it very dry and incomprehensible. And this comes from a guy who loves Fire Walk with Me and Solaris. This film just annoyed me constantly with it's dry and boring dialog, silly philosophical lectures and borderline ridiculous visual symbolism's. I usually tend to like these art-house, style over substance films. Especially if they come from Asia, but watching Ghost in the Shell was just frustrating and unrewarding. You can call me stupid and tell me, that I don't get it, all you want. Watching characters exchanging exposition in flat, static shots isn't entertaining. And listening to heavy handed philosophy isn't either. The plot was confusing and characters just felt lifeless and completely uninteresting. We spend time watching our lead characters boobs, pretty scenery and boring characters talking about the plot. Ghost in the Shell is a poor example at visual storytelling and shoving scenes with symbolic images doesn't make it good or compelling. There were some things that I liked in it.

Go and see Ghost in the Shell and examine it for yourselves. Like all art-house films, this will create a different reaction from it's audience members. Some might hate it and others will love it. I didn't enjoy it and if you want a more straight forward science fiction anime or film for that matter, go watch Moon, Children of Men, Dark City or even Matrix.

    Mamoru Oshii's Ghost in the Shell is a science fiction anime film that raised the bar for Japanese animation. Its complex woven narrative is set in a society where being a full-flesh human is no longer the norm. Is humanity losing its existence or is it loosely defined? Cyborgs are part human, part machine, and a continuation of a previously "whole" human entity. Major Motoko Kusanagi, a full-replacement cyborg in the national security division Section 9, is investigating a mysterious hacker who goes by the name "The Puppet Master." It may be apparent throughout the film that many of its aspects and ideas have been borrowed for other films such as The Matrix (source code; plugging into the network) and Inception (diving into another's conscious). Ghost in the Shell's portrayal of the significant role of networking in society appears strange and exaggerated to us but carries with it a strong familiarity and subtle message. Our reliance on networking is similarly demonstrated in The Matrix, but GITS takes it beyond questioning the basis of reality by turning to the self. The dualistic nature of mankind's existence is so prominently explored that it is reflected by the film's title itself. Physical vs. metaphysical mind vs. body the ghost vs. the shell. Cartesian dualism is a theory that the mind and body interact yet remain distinct from one another. Major Kusanagi contemplates what determines the identity of an individual. What defines life? Almost entirely artificially constructed, she questions her own existence. Is the ghost distinct from the shell? When someone is ghost hacked, they no longer have memories. So is the ghost (a loose metaphor for mind) what defines the self? Her resolution is reached as she merges with the Puppet Master, who suggests that life is simply a component of the network of all things. After the merge, the major and hacker share one entity with a blueprint for regeneration and become an integral part of the network by achieving a higher consciousness. The chief of Section 6 refers to the Puppet Master as a self-preserving program to which the hacker objects that by that logic, the human genome is no different. The Puppet Master claims to be a ghost born "within the flow of information" and goes on to define life from a person's memories. Ghost in the Shell manages to mix seamlessly integrated CGI and hand drawn animation, a complex but fitting plot, a resonant score, intermittent action sequences (complete with thermoptic camouflage!), and heavy philosophy (without being preachy) into an 82 minute runtime to make for a profound experience with loads of replay value.

    Ghost in the Shell is one of the ultimate nerd movies. A science fiction anime aimed at smart audiences. It's fundamentally about artificial intelligence and how human can be an individual that is mostly synthetic. At slightly over 80 minutes the movie is rather short and the story is rather simple, more of a short philosophical comment on what means to be human and life form, not a simple machine. The film follows a cyborg, major Kusanagi, which works for the police to track down an international criminal, which is initially though to be an American hacker but soon it is revealed to be something entirely different. I wouldn't say what it is to not spoil the film. My favorite thing about this movie was the amazing quality of the animation: it was hugely detailed and of excellent quality, among the best ever seem. A very good movie, highly recommended for science fiction fans.

    If you have not seen this anime go out, right now, and buy it. I can not implore you enough. To start off, the artistic style is amazing. I have not seen a anime that except for Akita(By the way see that too) that brought me to such emotion except for this. secondly the characters and dialog are three dimensional the are as complex as real human beings. And lastly, the story. What I can say about this story is only barred by a character limit. The ideas and messages of this anime are philosophical! The ideas of what life truly is was questioned. The idea that we have a soul is questioned. The story is as complex as the characters that star in it. several times i felt like i was watching a movie written by one of the grate Greek philosophers! Yeah, it is that good. it is so complex that you have to watch it several times just to understand half of it!

    Before I start this review, remember I DID watch the subbed version, I did not watch the supposedly inferior English dub with supposedly worse dialogue and voice acting. Right off I get what is good at of the way. The action, as sparse as it was (About 4 violent scenes that last about 2 minutes each max), is amazing. The opening is one of the coolest scenes I have ever seen. The anime is incredibly well animated, and the character designs are fantastic. However, the anime has a multitude of problems in its writing. Characters are poorly written, and overly blunt. Ironically, this makes them seem almost robotic. The main character is a great example of this. She has a fitting voice actor choice, but has so poor dialogue it doesn't even matter if she is well voiced or not. It also helps that the lack of emotion in the main character (which is clearly intentional with her character design) would likely be pretty easy to voice act. Many of the scenes drag at far longer then they should, surprising in such a short movie, and fail to convey the philosophical discussion with any kind of subtly. The important scenes that drive the plot however seem to go so fast (and their not action scenes) that its like they made them last and ran out of budget right before beginning them. Then there is the random scenes with the amazing music showing stills of the cyberpunk world. While the music here was awesome, it seems the only reasons for their existence was to A. Extend the anime long enough to be considered a movie and B. Force feed you that this is an "Artsy" anime that's trying to be deep and meaningful, something it fails at both. The ending is the worst part in a fairly boring anime. While it ends after an extremely awesome scene, it feels like its has been setting up the anime for an interesting plot twist...only to execute it so badly and explain so little that it feels like that it wasn't even the twist and that actual twist will be reveal in 5-15 minutes...at which point the movie ends. And I am left stunned that this anime was ever considered a masterpiece. Especially since so little actually happened. I could explain the entire plot in three sentences without skimping on details. (Which I don't of course since putting spoilers in a review ruins the point of writing one) The poor writing and pacing of the story, and the way it tries to force feed the philosophical nature of the movie's themes causes the movie to be an utter disappointment and laborious experience. Its like they thought "We want to make a movie with philosophical themes, but we don't want to write a good story" causing it to feel like 'Babbies first philosophical movie' instead of 'Interesting and complex cyberpunk movie with philosophical undertones' like it should have been.

    Everys 20 or so years a filmmaker will just pull one out of his hat and stun everyone, and Ghost in the Shell is that film. I'd give it more than 10 out of 10 but this website won't let me. Animation of such rich detail and gorgeously done, this is eye-candy of the highest order, but it's not just flashing colours and big-eyed girls. The character and plot are adult and intelligent, and I'll bet most folks will benefit from multiple viewings. Days afterwards, you will still be troubled by the thoughts this film will generate. This is NOT for Disney fans or children, and will reward intelligent and smart adult audiences. Now, I've seen some fairly short reviews in here, but for some reason I am being hectored to type a minimum 10 lines.

    When you look up anim&eacute; movies, two movies will repeatedly get mentioned - Akira and Ghost In The Shell. And with good reason. This movie was a lot better than I had anticipated. I was expecting something like a Lara Croft: Tomb Raider kind of movie, but this was something else, thankfully. The year is 2029. The world has become intensively information oriented and humans are well-connected to the network. Crime has developed into a sophisticated stage by hacking into the interactive network. To prevent this, Section 9 is formed. These are cyborgs with incredible strengths and abilities that can access any network on Earth. This movie (directed by Mamoru Oshii) was the movie that was supposed to bring the anim&eacute; genre to the western audience, it failed at that, and I can understand why. Like the movie Cloud Atlas, this movie quickly becomes more complex than your average action flick and I think that this turns a lot of people off. The movie starts of as an action movie, but it quickly turns into a more philosophical piece. I was actually pretty intrigued by some of the movies philosophical questions, which I am not going to analyze in this review, but the main topic is; What makes a human? and more importantly, what makes a human an individual? The animation was good, though it is funny to see how much anim&eacute; styles change for each decade. You can just compare Ghost In The Shell (1995) with Ghost In The Shell 2 (2004) to notice the difference. The voice acting was also very good (I watched the Japanese version as I hate dubs, but some say that they also like the English version) I would also really like to give a shoutout Kenji Kawai(the music composer), this guy is awesome at making soundtracks. The cinematographer (Hisao Shirai) in this movie also does an awesome job, though I am not familiar with any of his other movies. Kenji Kawai and Hisao Shirai really elevates this movie to something else. The shots of the post-apocalyptic city along with the very haunting soundtrack was very intense. My only complaint about the movie is that I don't think it was long enough. It runs for 1:22 including credits, and there is definitely not any time wasted. The plot moves very fast, and so does the dialogue, which I thought was a shame because some of the dialouge really needed to sink in (for me at least), but it then quickly moves on to the next scene. Imo, this movie could have been a lot better with a running time of ~2 hours. Where we could have seen more of the city, and learned more about the status of the world which the movie only covers briefly. I don't know if the short running time is a deliberate choice made by the director, or if it is a matter of budget issues. I believe it is the latter, it is a little bit like (though not nearly as bad) as the new Berserk movies, in which they really amped up the animation quality, but they have also slaughtered more than 50% of the story that was in the original manga and anime. Overall great action, great animation, great voice acting, really great soundtrack, very nice cinematography, but a little too short imo. I highly recommend.

    Both of Oshii's main GitS movies are extremely stylish and enjoyable, but there is a LOT of really uncalled for nudity in this one. The GitS movies revolve around the concept that there are very human-like robots and cyborgs that inhabit the earth and that they have souls, called Ghosts, that inhabit their outer robot shells. These Ghosts can not only communicate with each other telepathically, but can switch shells, go on the equivalent of the internet, and be hacked, thus changing the reality that they experience. This movie follows a team of the once-organic female Major Kusanagi and the male Batou cyborg/robots as they track down a Ghost hacker called the "Puppet Master". Good times are had by all, the visuals have aged very well and still look better than a lot of what's currently out there. A must-see for anime movie fans.

    I didn't like Ghost in the Shell and found it very dry and incomprehensible. And this comes from a guy who loves Fire Walk with Me and Solaris. This film just annoyed me constantly with it's dry and boring dialog, silly philosophical lectures and borderline ridiculous visual symbolism's. I usually tend to like these art-house, style over substance films. Especially if they come from Asia, but watching Ghost in the Shell was just frustrating and unrewarding. You can call me stupid and tell me, that I don't get it, all you want. Watching characters exchanging exposition in flat, static shots isn't entertaining. And listening to heavy handed philosophy isn't either. The plot was confusing and characters just felt lifeless and completely uninteresting. We spend time watching our lead characters boobs, pretty scenery and boring characters talking about the plot. Ghost in the Shell is a poor example at visual storytelling and shoving scenes with symbolic images doesn't make it good or compelling. There were some things that I liked in it. The visuals and designs were gorgeous. The attention to detail and the fluid animation mixed with the visuals created beautiful atmosphere. I watched the original Japanese dub and it was good. But nothing of that really matters when the story is so frustrating and has so much pretentious crap in it that Terrence Malick would be proud. Go and see Ghost in the Shell and examine it for yourselves. Like all art-house films, this will create a different reaction from it's audience members. Some might hate it and others will love it. I didn't enjoy it and if you want a more straight forward science fiction anime or film for that matter, go watch Moon, Children of Men, Dark City or even Matrix. And as for me, I will stick to Blade Runner, thank you very much...

    This is a review of "Ghost in the Shell" and "Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence", two animated films by Mamouru Oshii. The titles of both films allude to the "ghost in the machine", philosopher Gilbert Ryle's description of Descartes' mind-body dualism. Both films spend much of their time drawing parallels between animals, pets, simple machines, human beings, augmented humans, cyborgs, computers and robots. Oshii then uses these parallels to introduce various questions regarding hard and soft free-will, predestination and nascent intelligence. Bored yet? Today many neuroscientists are quite happy to cast away the notion of both hard freewill and the Sovereign Self. Indeed, many recent experiments are starting to show that a large number of human activities, actions, thought processes etc are preconscious; they occur before we consciously decide to do them. To many eliminativist philosophers, The Self, what you think of as a free, independent agent, is but a phenomenal self model (an accidental byproduct of our senses) whose content is not innate but impersonally programmed by extrinsic sources. It's a relatively recently "built" neurocomputational model - not a soul or mental or coherent essence - which mistakes itself for an uncaused causer capable of initiating causal chains. Free-will is interpreted in a similarly reductionist light; man is not a free agent but a machine programmed or buffeted by a host of invisible triggers (social, external, environmental, biological, neurological, genetic, cultural, language etc), all of which are responsible for his actions, thoughts and subjective content. If the Self is Other, than Will is likewise. To Eastern religions, this is hardly radical. Indeed, the major religions of both the East and the West can be seen as a response to the Self. Very broadly speaking, Western monotheistic religions assert the existence of a God whose authority, strength, demands and wisdom keep the Self concrete, whereas Eastern religions try to weaken these ideas, and stress a kind of depersonalisation, or collapsing of all barriers. One side's ego boosting (you're real, you matter, free choice, a preoccupation with acquisition etc), one seeks ego death (self as illusion, let go, illusionary self, no bodies, only interconnected matter etc). Giving up the former idea is like man's rejection of geocentricism. When people started to see the earth as just another moving object, man was essentially displaced from the centre of the universe. Many were unsettled and alarmed by this idea. The status quo actively suppressed the Copernican revolution. Today the idea's accepted and viewed as being liberating and empowering rather than a threat. Today it's the eliminativist mindset that's deemed abhorrent. To such scientists, consciousness is severely limited and self understanding is particularly delusional. We are conscious of but a morsel of our external world, and even less of our internal, mental worlds. Our "inner and outer experiences" are themselves neuro-simulations that have been evolutionary fashioned for survival value, rather than representational truthfulness. The implication is not only that there is no "we", and that our consciousness is not "ours", but that consciousness is itself unconscious, highly inept. Most of our explanations and understandings of others, things, people and environments are themselves delusional, self-aggrandising fictions. What we say, think, feel, perceive, and do are but the consequences of deterministic physical (electro-chemical) processes in our neurons, and our own motivations and "reasons" are oft misunderstood, or may not even exist at all. We never actually decide on any of our actions; rather, our sense of choice and decision, and the reasons and motivations we cite for what we do, are all post-hoc rationalisations of processes that happen mechanistically via electrochemical cause-and-effect. All our rationales, and all our values, are themselves nothing more than consolatory fictions. Suicidal yet? This is taking a certain form of reductionism, or empirical materialism, to its extreme (Metzinger etc), and while it is "correct", neurobiology and cognitive psychology are still not advanced enough to tell us quite how "correct" it all is. We know little about the processes of "decision making" and scientists are still constantly (Walter J Freeman, Damasio, John McCrone etc) trying to rehabilitate the idea of "choice", teasing out nuances between voluntary and involuntary processes. One interesting line of study involves Cotard's syndrome, a pathological condition which results in a kind of "ego disturbance". Sufferers are unable to run "self simulations" and are unable to "perceive themselves" as being the "centre of their consciousness". Cotard's patients thus think they are dead, or deny their own existence. They stop using personal pronounces (I, me etc), refer to themselves as "it", rationalise their own non-existence and begin to develop a machine-like emotional "flatness". This  a conscious subject denying its own existence  of course seems bizarre to most, but such a form of existence denial highlights how incredibly fickle our own concepts of self-hood and existence are. Indeed, Cotard's syndrome heavily resembles the spiritual experiences reportedly induced and experienced by shamans and mystics. In both cases, the result seems to be a transition from a phenomenal self model (a simulational model with an "I" reference point), or subject model, to an object model (a decentralised simulation); a shift from a first person perspective to first-object perspective, in which the phenomenal property of "mineness" disappears from the patient's reality. This loss is theorised to be caused by either an extreme suppression of emotions, or a "glitch" which results in both affectlessness and, bizarrely, a replacement of "self concern" with something the patients describe as being "egoless" and "bigger". Studies also demonstrate that an increased awareness of the self-model as a model has the effect of making the self seem less real, which of course is akin to a scientific proof of a kind "spiritual enlightenment" (ie dissolution of the self). 8.5/10 - "Shell 1's" more of a traditional action-anime, whilst Oshii cites Antonioni and Godard as an influence on "Shell 2".

    Well, where do I start? Let me begin by saying that this is the one and only film that I've watched twice, in a row. Directly after each other (!). Since then I have watched Ghost in the Shell many times again, at least 20 times. This may sound a bit crazy, but the film is of such depth, with such a complex story, that you have to be very attentive to get the whole story, and it's quite impossible to fully understand the movie after one viewing. (especially when you watch it with subtitles) In fact, not all plots in the movie have tied up ends, which makes the film all the more intriguing. The main reason I've had multiple viewings, is, well, because it's art. I'm a fan of science-fiction, especially the intelligent kind, and I like manga, and this movie is the best in its genre. The artwork is sublime, with incredible detail. The music is mesmerizingly beautiful, and fits the existential atmosphere perfectly. The story is based on the book of Masamune Shirow, who deserves a lot of credit, for coming up with all these original ideas (the fingers that type the code!, to mention one). There's a lot of philosophy in it, enough to keep a few discussions at the pub going. At last a lot of credit goes to Mamoru Oshii, the director, for the intelligent script, excellent editing and infusion of Weltschmertz and existentialism. It's been a while since I've seen Ghost in the Shell, and there's only one reason for it: I've lent my copy to a friend. Can't wait to watch it again! Watching Ghost in the Shell is like going to church for me, the good kind :-) Enjoy the movie!

    When you look up anim&eacute; movies, two movies will repeatedly get mentioned - Akira and Ghost In The Shell. And with good reason. This movie was a lot better than I had anticipated. I was expecting something like a Lara Croft: Tomb Raider kind of movie, but this was something else, thankfully. The year is 2029. The world has become intensively information oriented and humans are well-connected to the network. Crime has developed into a sophisticated stage by hacking into the interactive network. To prevent this, Section 9 is formed. These are cyborgs with incredible strengths and abilities that can access any network on Earth. This movie (directed by Mamoru Oshii) was the movie that was supposed to bring the anim&eacute; genre to the western audience, it failed at that, and I can understand why. Like the movie Cloud Atlas, this movie quickly becomes more complex than your average action flick and I think that this turns a lot of people off. The movie starts of as an action movie, but it quickly turns into a more philosophical piece. I was actually pretty intrigued by some of the movies philosophical questions, which I am not going to analyze in this review, but the main topic is; What makes a human? and more importantly, what makes a human an individual? The animation was good, though it is funny to see how much anim&eacute; styles change for each decade. You can just compare Ghost In The Shell (1995) with Ghost In The Shell 2 (2004) to notice the difference. The voice acting was also very good (I watched the Japanese version as I hate dubs, but some say that they also like the English version) I would also really like to give a shoutout Kenji Kawai(the music composer), this guy is awesome at making soundtracks. The cinematographer (Hisao Shirai) in this movie also does an awesome job, though I am not familiar with any of his other movies. Kenji Kawai and Hisao Shirai really elevates this movie to something else. The shots of the post-apocalyptic city along with the very haunting soundtrack was very intense. My only complaint about the movie is that I don't think it was long enough. It runs for 1:22 including credits, and there is definitely not any time wasted. The plot moves very fast, and so does the dialogue, which I thought was a shame because some of the dialouge really needed to sink in (for me at least), but it then quickly moves on to the next scene. Imo, this movie could have been a lot better with a running time of ~2 hours. Where we could have seen more of the city, and learned more about the status of the world which the movie only covers briefly. I don't know if the short running time is a deliberate choice made by the director, or if it is a matter of budget issues. I believe it is the latter, it is a little bit like (though not nearly as bad) as the new Berserk movies, in which they really amped up the animation quality, but they have also slaughtered more than 50% of the story that was in the original manga and anime. Overall great action, great animation, great voice acting, really great soundtrack, very nice cinematography, but a little too short imo. I highly recommend.

    Both of Oshii's main GitS movies are extremely stylish and enjoyable, but there is a LOT of really uncalled for nudity in this one. The GitS movies revolve around the concept that there are very human-like robots and cyborgs that inhabit the earth and that they have souls, called Ghosts, that inhabit their outer robot shells. These Ghosts can not only communicate with each other telepathically, but can switch shells, go on the equivalent of the internet, and be hacked, thus changing the reality that they experience. This movie follows a team of the once-organic female Major Kusanagi and the male Batou cyborg/robots as they track down a Ghost hacker called the "Puppet Master". Good times are had by all, the visuals have aged very well and still look better than a lot of what's currently out there. A must-see for anime movie fans.

    I didn't like Ghost in the Shell and found it very dry and incomprehensible. And this comes from a guy who loves Fire Walk with Me and Solaris. This film just annoyed me constantly with it's dry and boring dialog, silly philosophical lectures and borderline ridiculous visual symbolism's. I usually tend to like these art-house, style over substance films. Especially if they come from Asia, but watching Ghost in the Shell was just frustrating and unrewarding. You can call me stupid and tell me, that I don't get it, all you want. Watching characters exchanging exposition in flat, static shots isn't entertaining. And listening to heavy handed philosophy isn't either. The plot was confusing and characters just felt lifeless and completely uninteresting. We spend time watching our lead characters boobs, pretty scenery and boring characters talking about the plot. Ghost in the Shell is a poor example at visual storytelling and shoving scenes with symbolic images doesn't make it good or compelling. There were some things that I liked in it. The visuals and designs were gorgeous. The attention to detail and the fluid animation mixed with the visuals created beautiful atmosphere. I watched the original Japanese dub and it was good. But nothing of that really matters when the story is so frustrating and has so much pretentious crap in it that Terrence Malick would be proud. Go and see Ghost in the Shell and examine it for yourselves. Like all art-house films, this will create a different reaction from it's audience members. Some might hate it and others will love it. I didn't enjoy it and if you want a more straight forward science fiction anime or film for that matter, go watch Moon, Children of Men, Dark City or even Matrix. And as for me, I will stick to Blade Runner, thank you very much...

    This is a review of "Ghost in the Shell" and "Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence", two animated films by Mamouru Oshii. The titles of both films allude to the "ghost in the machine", philosopher Gilbert Ryle's description of Descartes' mind-body dualism. Both films spend much of their time drawing parallels between animals, pets, simple machines, human beings, augmented humans, cyborgs, computers and robots. Oshii then uses these parallels to introduce various questions regarding hard and soft free-will, predestination and nascent intelligence. Bored yet? Today many neuroscientists are quite happy to cast away the notion of both hard freewill and the Sovereign Self. Indeed, many recent experiments are starting to show that a large number of human activities, actions, thought processes etc are preconscious; they occur before we consciously decide to do them. To many eliminativist philosophers, The Self, what you think of as a free, independent agent, is but a phenomenal self model (an accidental byproduct of our senses) whose content is not innate but impersonally programmed by extrinsic sources. It's a relatively recently "built" neurocomputational model - not a soul or mental or coherent essence - which mistakes itself for an uncaused causer capable of initiating causal chains. Free-will is interpreted in a similarly reductionist light; man is not a free agent but a machine programmed or buffeted by a host of invisible triggers (social, external, environmental, biological, neurological, genetic, cultural, language etc), all of which are responsible for his actions, thoughts and subjective content. If the Self is Other, than Will is likewise. To Eastern religions, this is hardly radical. Indeed, the major religions of both the East and the West can be seen as a response to the Self. Very broadly speaking, Western monotheistic religions assert the existence of a God whose authority, strength, demands and wisdom keep the Self concrete, whereas Eastern religions try to weaken these ideas, and stress a kind of depersonalisation, or collapsing of all barriers. One side's ego boosting (you're real, you matter, free choice, a preoccupation with acquisition etc), one seeks ego death (self as illusion, let go, illusionary self, no bodies, only interconnected matter etc). Giving up the former idea is like man's rejection of geocentricism. When people started to see the earth as just another moving object, man was essentially displaced from the centre of the universe. Many were unsettled and alarmed by this idea. The status quo actively suppressed the Copernican revolution. Today the idea's accepted and viewed as being liberating and empowering rather than a threat. Today it's the eliminativist mindset that's deemed abhorrent. To such scientists, consciousness is severely limited and self understanding is particularly delusional. We are conscious of but a morsel of our external world, and even less of our internal, mental worlds. Our "inner and outer experiences" are themselves neuro-simulations that have been evolutionary fashioned for survival value, rather than representational truthfulness. The implication is not only that there is no "we", and that our consciousness is not "ours", but that consciousness is itself unconscious, highly inept. Most of our explanations and understandings of others, things, people and environments are themselves delusional, self-aggrandising fictions. What we say, think, feel, perceive, and do are but the consequences of deterministic physical (electro-chemical) processes in our neurons, and our own motivations and "reasons" are oft misunderstood, or may not even exist at all. We never actually decide on any of our actions; rather, our sense of choice and decision, and the reasons and motivations we cite for what we do, are all post-hoc rationalisations of processes that happen mechanistically via electrochemical cause-and-effect. All our rationales, and all our values, are themselves nothing more than consolatory fictions. Suicidal yet? This is taking a certain form of reductionism, or empirical materialism, to its extreme (Metzinger etc), and while it is "correct", neurobiology and cognitive psychology are still not advanced enough to tell us quite how "correct" it all is. We know little about the processes of "decision making" and scientists are still constantly (Walter J Freeman, Damasio, John McCrone etc) trying to rehabilitate the idea of "choice", teasing out nuances between voluntary and involuntary processes. One interesting line of study involves Cotard's syndrome, a pathological condition which results in a kind of "ego disturbance". Sufferers are unable to run "self simulations" and are unable to "perceive themselves" as being the "centre of their consciousness". Cotard's patients thus think they are dead, or deny their own existence. They stop using personal pronounces (I, me etc), refer to themselves as "it", rationalise their own non-existence and begin to develop a machine-like emotional "flatness". This  a conscious subject denying its own existence  of course seems bizarre to most, but such a form of existence denial highlights how incredibly fickle our own concepts of self-hood and existence are. Indeed, Cotard's syndrome heavily resembles the spiritual experiences reportedly induced and experienced by shamans and mystics. In both cases, the result seems to be a transition from a phenomenal self model (a simulational model with an "I" reference point), or subject model, to an object model (a decentralised simulation); a shift from a first person perspective to first-object perspective, in which the phenomenal property of "mineness" disappears from the patient's reality. This loss is theorised to be caused by either an extreme suppression of emotions, or a "glitch" which results in both affectlessness and, bizarrely, a replacement of "self concern" with something the patients describe as being "egoless" and "bigger". Studies also demonstrate that an increased awareness of the self-model as a model has the effect of making the self seem less real, which of course is akin to a scientific proof of a kind "spiritual enlightenment" (ie dissolution of the self). 8.5/10 - "Shell 1's" more of a traditional action-anime, whilst Oshii cites Antonioni and Godard as an influence on "Shell 2".

    Well, where do I start? Let me begin by saying that this is the one and only film that I've watched twice, in a row. Directly after each other (!). Since then I have watched Ghost in the Shell many times again, at least 20 times. This may sound a bit crazy, but the film is of such depth, with such a complex story, that you have to be very attentive to get the whole story, and it's quite impossible to fully understand the movie after one viewing. (especially when you watch it with subtitles) In fact, not all plots in the movie have tied up ends, which makes the film all the more intriguing. The main reason I've had multiple viewings, is, well, because it's art. I'm a fan of science-fiction, especially the intelligent kind, and I like manga, and this movie is the best in its genre. The artwork is sublime, with incredible detail. The music is mesmerizingly beautiful, and fits the existential atmosphere perfectly. The story is based on the book of Masamune Shirow, who deserves a lot of credit, for coming up with all these original ideas (the fingers that type the code!, to mention one). There's a lot of philosophy in it, enough to keep a few discussions at the pub going. At last a lot of credit goes to Mamoru Oshii, the director, for the intelligent script, excellent editing and infusion of Weltschmertz and existentialism. It's been a while since I've seen Ghost in the Shell, and there's only one reason for it: I've lent my copy to a friend. Can't wait to watch it again! Watching Ghost in the Shell is like going to church for me, the good kind :-) Enjoy the movie!

    Mamoru Oshii's Ghost in the Shell is a science fiction anime film that raised the bar for Japanese animation. Its complex woven narrative is set in a society where being a full-flesh human is no longer the norm. Is humanity losing its existence or is it loosely defined? Cyborgs are part human, part machine, and a continuation of a previously "whole" human entity. Major Motoko Kusanagi, a full-replacement cyborg in the national security division Section 9, is investigating a mysterious hacker who goes by the name "The Puppet Master." It may be apparent throughout the film that many of its aspects and ideas have been borrowed for other films such as The Matrix (source code; plugging into the network) and Inception (diving into another's conscious). Ghost in the Shell's portrayal of the significant role of networking in society appears strange and exaggerated to us but carries with it a strong familiarity and subtle message. Our reliance on networking is similarly demonstrated in The Matrix, but GITS takes it beyond questioning the basis of reality by turning to the self. The dualistic nature of mankind's existence is so prominently explored that it is reflected by the film's title itself. Physical vs. metaphysical mind vs. body the ghost vs. the shell. Cartesian dualism is a theory that the mind and body interact yet remain distinct from one another. Major Kusanagi contemplates what determines the identity of an individual. What defines life? Almost entirely artificially constructed, she questions her own existence. Is the ghost distinct from the shell? When someone is ghost hacked, they no longer have memories. So is the ghost (a loose metaphor for mind) what defines the self? Her resolution is reached as she merges with the Puppet Master, who suggests that life is simply a component of the network of all things. After the merge, the major and hacker share one entity with a blueprint for regeneration and become an integral part of the network by achieving a higher consciousness. The chief of Section 6 refers to the Puppet Master as a self-preserving program to which the hacker objects that by that logic, the human genome is no different. The Puppet Master claims to be a ghost born "within the flow of information" and goes on to define life from a person's memories. Ghost in the Shell manages to mix seamlessly integrated CGI and hand drawn animation, a complex but fitting plot, a resonant score, intermittent action sequences (complete with thermoptic camouflage!), and heavy philosophy (without being preachy) into an 82 minute runtime to make for a profound experience with loads of replay value.

    Ghost in the Shell is one of the ultimate nerd movies. A science fiction anime aimed at smart audiences. It's fundamentally about artificial intelligence and how human can be an individual that is mostly synthetic. At slightly over 80 minutes the movie is rather short and the story is rather simple, more of a short philosophical comment on what means to be human and life form, not a simple machine. The film follows a cyborg, major Kusanagi, which works for the police to track down an international criminal, which is initially though to be an American hacker but soon it is revealed to be something entirely different. I wouldn't say what it is to not spoil the film. My favorite thing about this movie was the amazing quality of the animation: it was hugely detailed and of excellent quality, among the best ever seem. A very good movie, highly recommended for science fiction fans.

    If you have not seen this anime go out, right now, and buy it. I can not implore you enough. To start off, the artistic style is amazing. I have not seen a anime that except for Akita(By the way see that too) that brought me to such emotion except for this. secondly the characters and dialog are three dimensional the are as complex as real human beings. And lastly, the story. What I can say about this story is only barred by a character limit. The ideas and messages of this anime are philosophical! The ideas of what life truly is was questioned. The idea that we have a soul is questioned. The story is as complex as the characters that star in it. several times i felt like i was watching a movie written by one of the grate Greek philosophers! Yeah, it is that good. it is so complex that you have to watch it several times just to understand half of it!

    Before I start this review, remember I DID watch the subbed version, I did not watch the supposedly inferior English dub with supposedly worse dialogue and voice acting. Right off I get what is good at of the way. The action, as sparse as it was (About 4 violent scenes that last about 2 minutes each max), is amazing. The opening is one of the coolest scenes I have ever seen. The anime is incredibly well animated, and the character designs are fantastic. However, the anime has a multitude of problems in its writing. Characters are poorly written, and overly blunt. Ironically, this makes them seem almost robotic. The main character is a great example of this. She has a fitting voice actor choice, but has so poor dialogue it doesn't even matter if she is well voiced or not. It also helps that the lack of emotion in the main character (which is clearly intentional with her character design) would likely be pretty easy to voice act. Many of the scenes drag at far longer then they should, surprising in such a short movie, and fail to convey the philosophical discussion with any kind of subtly. The important scenes that drive the plot however seem to go so fast (and their not action scenes) that its like they made them last and ran out of budget right before beginning them. Then there is the random scenes with the amazing music showing stills of the cyberpunk world. While the music here was awesome, it seems the only reasons for their existence was to A. Extend the anime long enough to be considered a movie and B. Force feed you that this is an "Artsy" anime that's trying to be deep and meaningful, something it fails at both. The ending is the worst part in a fairly boring anime. While it ends after an extremely awesome scene, it feels like its has been setting up the anime for an interesting plot twist...only to execute it so badly and explain so little that it feels like that it wasn't even the twist and that actual twist will be reveal in 5-15 minutes...at which point the movie ends. And I am left stunned that this anime was ever considered a masterpiece. Especially since so little actually happened. I could explain the entire plot in three sentences without skimping on details. (Which I don't of course since putting spoilers in a review ruins the point of writing one) The poor writing and pacing of the story, and the way it tries to force feed the philosophical nature of the movie's themes causes the movie to be an utter disappointment and laborious experience. Its like they thought "We want to make a movie with philosophical themes, but we don't want to write a good story" causing it to feel like 'Babbies first philosophical movie' instead of 'Interesting and complex cyberpunk movie with philosophical undertones' like it should have been.

    Everys 20 or so years a filmmaker will just pull one out of his hat and stun everyone, and Ghost in the Shell is that film. I'd give it more than 10 out of 10 but this website won't let me. Animation of such rich detail and gorgeously done, this is eye-candy of the highest order, but it's not just flashing colours and big-eyed girls. The character and plot are adult and intelligent, and I'll bet most folks will benefit from multiple viewings. Days afterwards, you will still be troubled by the thoughts this film will generate. This is NOT for Disney fans or children, and will reward intelligent and smart adult audiences. Now, I've seen some fairly short reviews in here, but for some reason I am being hectored to type a minimum 10 lines.

Many were unsettled and alarmed by this idea. The status quo actively suppressed the Copernican revolution. Today the idea's accepted and viewed as being liberating and empowering rather than a threat. Today it's the eliminativist mindset that's deemed abhorrent. To such scientists, consciousness is severely limited and self understanding is particularly delusional. We are conscious of but a morsel of our external world, and even less of our internal, mental worlds. Our "inner and outer experiences" are themselves neuro-simulations that have been evolutionary fashioned for survival value, rather than representational truthfulness. The implication is not only that there is no "we", and that our consciousness is not "ours", but that consciousness is itself unconscious, highly inept. Most of our explanations and understandings of others, things, people and environments are themselves delusional, self-aggrandising fictions. What we say, think, feel, perceive, and do are but the consequences of deterministic physical (electro-chemical) processes in our neurons, and our own motivations and "reasons" are oft misunderstood, or may not even exist at all. We never actually decide on any of our actions; rather, our sense of choice and decision, and the reasons and motivations we cite for what we do, are all post-hoc rationalisations of processes that happen mechanistically via electrochemical cause-and-effect. All our rationales, and all our values, are themselves nothing more than consolatory fictions. Suicidal yet? This is taking a certain form of reductionism, or empirical materialism, to its extreme (Metzinger etc), and while it is "correct", neurobiology and cognitive psychology are still not advanced enough to tell us quite how "correct" it all is. We know little about the processes of "decision making" and scientists are still constantly (Walter J Freeman, Damasio, John McCrone etc) trying to rehabilitate the idea of "choice", teasing out nuances between voluntary and involuntary processes. One interesting line of study involves Cotard's syndrome, a pathological condition which results in a kind of "ego disturbance". Sufferers are unable to run "self simulations" and are unable to "perceive themselves" as being the "centre of their consciousness". Cotard's patients thus think they are dead, or deny their own existence. They stop using personal pronounces (I, me etc), refer to themselves as "it", rationalise their own non-existence and begin to develop a machine-like emotional "flatness". This  a conscious subject denying its own existence  of course seems bizarre to most, but such a form of existence denial highlights how incredibly fickle our own concepts of self-hood and existence are. Indeed, Cotard's syndrome heavily resembles the spiritual experiences reportedly induced and experienced by shamans and mystics. In both cases, the result seems to be a transition from a phenomenal self model (a simulational model with an "I" reference point), or subject model, to an object model (a decentralised simulation); a shift from a first person perspective to first-object perspective, in which the phenomenal property of "mineness" disappears from the patient's reality. This loss is theorised to be caused by either an extreme suppression of emotions, or a "glitch" which results in both affectlessness and, bizarrely, a replacement of "self concern" with something the patients describe as being "egoless" and "bigger". Studies also demonstrate that an increased awareness of the self-model as a model has the effect of making the self seem less real, which of course is akin to a scientific proof of a kind "spiritual enlightenment" (ie dissolution of the self). 8.5/10 - "Shell 1's" more of a traditional action-anime, whilst Oshii cites Antonioni and Godard as an influence on "Shell 2".

    Well, where do I start? Let me begin by saying that this is the one and only film that I've watched twice, in a row. Directly after each other (!). Since then I have watched Ghost in the Shell many times again, at least 20 times. This may sound a bit crazy, but the film is of such depth, with such a complex story, that you have to be very attentive to get the whole story, and it's quite impossible to fully understand the movie after one viewing. (especially when you watch it with subtitles) In fact, not all plots in the movie have tied up ends, which makes the film all the more intriguing. The main reason I've had multiple viewings, is, well, because it's art. I'm a fan of science-fiction, especially the intelligent kind, and I like manga, and this movie is the best in its genre. The artwork is sublime, with incredible detail. The music is mesmerizingly beautiful, and fits the existential atmosphere perfectly. The story is based on the book of Masamune Shirow, who deserves a lot of credit, for coming up with all these original ideas (the fingers that type the code!, to mention one). There's a lot of philosophy in it, enough to keep a few discussions at the pub going. At last a lot of credit goes to Mamoru Oshii, the director, for the intelligent script, excellent editing and infusion of Weltschmertz and existentialism. It's been a while since I've seen Ghost in the Shell, and there's only one reason for it: I've lent my copy to a friend. Can't wait to watch it again! Watching Ghost in the Shell is like going to church for me, the good kind :-) Enjoy the movie!

    Mamoru Oshii's Ghost in the Shell is a science fiction anime film that raised the bar for Japanese animation. Its complex woven narrative is set in a society where being a full-flesh human is no longer the norm. Is humanity losing its existence or is it loosely defined? Cyborgs are part human, part machine, and a continuation of a previously "whole" human entity. Major Motoko Kusanagi, a full-replacement cyborg in the national security division Section 9, is investigating a mysterious hacker who goes by the name "The Puppet Master." It may be apparent throughout the film that many of its aspects and ideas have been borrowed for other films such as The Matrix (source code; plugging into the network) and Inception (diving into another's conscious). Ghost in the Shell's portrayal of the significant role of networking in society appears strange and exaggerated to us but carries with it a strong familiarity and subtle message. Our reliance on networking is similarly demonstrated in The Matrix, but GITS takes it beyond questioning the basis of reality by turning to the self. The dualistic nature of mankind's existence is so prominently explored that it is reflected by the film's title itself. Physical vs. metaphysical mind vs. body the ghost vs. the shell. Cartesian dualism is a theory that the mind and body interact yet remain distinct from one another. Major Kusanagi contemplates what determines the identity of an individual. What defines life? Almost entirely artificially constructed, she questions her own existence. Is the ghost distinct from the shell? When someone is ghost hacked, they no longer have memories. So is the ghost (a loose metaphor for mind) what defines the self? Her resolution is reached as she merges with the Puppet Master, who suggests that life is simply a component of the network of all things. After the merge, the major and hacker share one entity with a blueprint for regeneration and become an integral part of the network by achieving a higher consciousness. The chief of Section 6 refers to the Puppet Master as a self-preserving program to which the hacker objects that by that logic, the human genome is no different. The Puppet Master claims to be a ghost born "within the flow of information" and goes on to define life from a person's memories. Ghost in the Shell manages to mix seamlessly integrated CGI and hand drawn animation, a complex but fitting plot, a resonant score, intermittent action sequences (complete with thermoptic camouflage!), and heavy philosophy (without being preachy) into an 82 minute runtime to make for a profound experience with loads of replay value.

    Ghost in the Shell is one of the ultimate nerd movies. A science fiction anime aimed at smart audiences. It's fundamentally about artificial intelligence and how human can be an individual that is mostly synthetic. At slightly over 80 minutes the movie is rather short and the story is rather simple, more of a short philosophical comment on what means to be human and life form, not a simple machine. The film follows a cyborg, major Kusanagi, which works for the police to track down an international criminal, which is initially though to be an American hacker but soon it is revealed to be something entirely different. I wouldn't say what it is to not spoil the film. My favorite thing about this movie was the amazing quality of the animation: it was hugely detailed and of excellent quality, among the best ever seem. A very good movie, highly recommended for science fiction fans.

    If you have not seen this anime go out, right now, and buy it. I can not implore you enough. To start off, the artistic style is amazing. I have not seen a anime that except for Akita(By the way see that too) that brought me to such emotion except for this. secondly the characters and dialog are three dimensional the are as complex as real human beings. And lastly, the story. What I can say about this story is only barred by a character limit. The ideas and messages of this anime are philosophical! The ideas of what life truly is was questioned. The idea that we have a soul is questioned. The story is as complex as the characters that star in it. several times i felt like i was watching a movie written by one of the grate Greek philosophers! Yeah, it is that good. it is so complex that you have to watch it several times just to understand half of it!
