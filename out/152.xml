    Sleeper, (1973), ***&frac12;/****. In the year 2103 AD, Miles Monroe (Played By Woody Allen.) wakes up after 200 years, to find himself living in a world inhabited with giant bananas, and Orgazmatrons. He disguises as a butler robot to spy on The Aires Project run by the government. Sleeper is a very inventive film, and it proves that Woody Allen's attempt at a silent comedy works very well, and he would later go on to making Oscar winning dramas, like Annie Hall, and Manhattan. Sleeper is a fantastic Sci-Fi comedy, and I very highly recommend it. 9/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    "Sleeper" is packed with visual (at times it's almost like a tribute to silent comedy) and verbal gags, but personally I don't think it is quite as funny as "Bananas", or quite as imaginative as the best sketch (the closing one) of "Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Sex (But Were Afraid To Ask)" (although the orgasmatron and the shaving-mirror scene come close), and the ending feels rushed. However, it is a very important part in Woody Allen's evolution: up to that point, his films were mostly "Woody against the world"; here, he's dancing (metaphorically, but sometimes also literally!) with a partner - and what a partner! Diane Keaton, at her sexiest and fastest, is almost like a female Woody Allen at times - that's how well-synchronized their teamwork is. Woody is so confident of Keaton's abilities that he even gives her a couple of wild comic scenes all to herself, like her Tarzan imitation, and he sometimes lets himself become the butt of her jokes ("You're dealing with one of the greatest minds you've ever encountered" - "Yeah, and his isn't so bad either!"). Apart from their heavenly pairing, the strongest asset of "Sleeper" is its wonderful jazz score. *** out of 4.

    Woody Allen aka Mr.Cinema Delivers A Winner Once Again in his 1973 cult-classic 'Sleeper'. A Terrific Sci-Fi Comedy, that comes in-tact with a host of good laughs. 'Sleeper' Synopsis: A nerdish store owner is revived out of cryostasis into a future world to fight an oppressive government. 'Sleeper' is amazing work. Allen & Marshall Brickman's Screenplay is a work of genius. They come up with a terrific concept, which translates into an equally terrific film. Each & Everything works! Allen's Direction, As Always, is Awe-Inspiring. Cinematography by David M. Walsh is good. Editing & Art Design, are wonderful. Performance-Wise: Allen delivers a marvelous performance in the central role. He embodies the character & delivers one of his finest performances. He's a treat to watch from start to finish. Diane Keaton is ever-dependable. John Beck is first-rate. Susan Miller leaves a mark. Others lend support. On the whole, 'Sleeper' is simply, unmissable. Mr.Cinema RULES!

    A freezer-burned Woody Allen emerges from a lengthy cryogenic slumber to apply his own specific brand of humor to the late 22nd century. At times overly topical and horribly dated, this is really at its best as a flippant physical comedy. Even then, the puns and gags are stretched awfully thin, with blatantly sped-up footage and a ragtime soundtrack giving it the look and feel of a futuristic Benny Hill. Allen's pokes and prods about the evolution of society are occasionally good for a snicker, particularly the advent of technology supplanting our need for sex, drugs and organized religion, but the central storyline is so thin and inessential that the whole mess feels like a series of vaguely-related skits. The glut of weak, DIY-esque backdrops and special effects make the arrival of Star Wars just four years later seem even more impressive by comparison. Mildly silly at best and utterly dull at worst, it's not something I'll be revisiting again soon, if ever.

    Sleeper is probably the best of Woody Allen's early 'funny' films. It tells the tale of a health food shop owner from 1973 waking up in 2173 after being cryogenically frozen after a botched hospital operation. The set-up is ideal for Allen to incorporate both slapstick humour and satire. It also has a strong enough central story-line to hold everything together cohesively. Not only that but its sci-fi trappings allow for a visually inventive aesthetic which adds a further dimension. More than probably any of his other movies this one gives Allen equal opportunity to show his skills at physical, as well as verbal, comedy. I suppose because its a sci-fi comedy in addition to its lower-brow elements, Sleeper is one of the most accessible of Allen's works to many. But having said that, its hardly an unintelligent film, the future setting allows for a lot of satirical content, while the script is as sharp and funny as you would expect. Once again the chemistry between Allen and Diane Keaton is excellent. In this movie, the latter plays a spoilt, vacuous upper-class pseudo-intellectual. This character allows for a lot of verbal sparring with Allen's angsty New Yorker. There are many individual funny moments. Too many to list really. What the film as a whole represents is the peak of Allen's full-on funny films. In addition, its one of those rare sci-fi films in which the dated look of the 'futuristic' sets and costumes actually works to its advantage; they add to the overall humour. The very fact that its a genre picture though adds considerable interest in itself, as it allows the director to play around with a few conventions. And, most importantly, it remains one of his funniest films too, which counts for a lot.

    Here is a guy (Allen) who married his wife's adopted daughter, whom he helped raise from a little girl. Somehow they let him get away with this. He should be in jail. What a sick disgusting creep he is. This movie was a disappointment. Most jokes were either little-to-half intelligent groaners, inside jokes or pop culture references that most people today wouldn't catch or remember. The acting was quite amateur as was the movie as a whole. I was not in a good mood after watching this years ago, and I certainly will not watch any of that pervert's movies now. If you like movies made by a child-molester, be my guest...

    I never thought I would ever find slapstick humor funny, until I saw "Sleeper." When the security police of a "futuristic" totalitarian regime is falling all over themselves, and a bumbling health food store owner from our time can outsmart them, slapstick is funny. As funny as this movie is, it also has serious content. For one thing, it's scary that a bumbling health food store owner can outwit the security force. The people must be so docile that the security force is not used to doing anything. It's scary how dumb everyone else is in the society too - Diane Keeton's poetry is terrible, and none of the characters recognize Woody Allen when he is pretending to be a robot (his lack of disguise is immediately apparent to the movie viewer). We are also led by Allen's character to wonder how different we really are from the people of the "future" portrayed in the film. Allen is obviously smarter and more jaded than the inhabitants of the future, but he claims to be an existentialist and does not appear to value anything except survival and pleasure. This is similar to the people of the future, who live for the sole purpose of experiencing orgy machines and drug-like balls that they hold in their hands. Finally, the movie asks us to consider the question of what constitutes our wants/needs/desires. We are told that in the society of the future, these are all taken care of more efficiently than we would have ever thought possible. But it is plainly on view here that the wants/needs/desires of the people in the society of the future have been shaped by the society in which they live. Thus, the question arises - to what extent are our own desires shaped by ourselves? Of course, I wasn't thinking about any of this while I watched the film. I was too busy laughing.

    *** out of **** One of the outrageously funny slapstick comedies from Woody Allen's early career, and a good place to start for Allen newcomers looking for fun. Woody was becoming a much more polished director by this time. He plays the lead role of a health food store owner who went into the hospital for minor surgery in the 20th Century, but wakes up in the futuristic world of 2173 where technology is way over his head and the state is engaged in a revolution. He is reluctantly befriended by a skeptical Diane Keaton who first fears him as an alien before joining his mission to foil a major government plot. Keaton and Allen were teamed previously in PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM but they really have a strong comical team chemistry here and would go on to make several other films together, including the award winning ANNIE HALL. In SLEEPER you can easily see where Woody was influenced by great classic comedians he's idolized like Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, and The Marx Brothers. The film seems to slow down just a bit in the last act, but overall this is a delightful and crazy hodgepodge of silliness.

    Is there anything Woody Allen can't do? Woody Allen doing sci-fi? What? There's no way that could work, right? Wrong. Allen, in all of his neurotic genius, has created his own zany brand of sci-fi comedy. Of course it is all in the style of your typical Woody Allen film and sci-fi is more of a backdrop, but there is still no denying that Allen has wonderfully blended the two genres. Sleeper is a movie about Miles Monroe, played, of course, by Woody Allen. Miles was a whole foods store owner and clarinet player who died in 1973. He is revived out of cryostatis 200 years into the future where the world is suppressed by a big brother type government. Miles only wants to go back to 1973, but he eventually gets involved with a rebellion against the government. This is a hilariously creative display of a pseudo-slapstick style of comedy with every situation and every moment of the film a laugh out loud and uproariously entertaining experience. While brimming with slapstick humor and physical comedy, Sleeper is also an excellent satire. The whole futuristic government satire idea is kind of burnt out by this point, but Sleeper shows itself off as one of the smarter examples of this motif in modern filmmaking. There are some hilarious moments, satirizing not so much the government, but more just society in general, like when it is revealed that things like chocolate and cigarettes are some of the most healthy products for the human body. This is even funnier when you account for the fact that Miles owned a health food store back in 1973 which only sold organic products. Miles makes various amusing comments about this throughout the film as well, making fun of society's obsession with eating healthy. The cleverness of this film is just so appeasing at times. Now I will say that this isn't the kind of high brow comedy that Woody Allen's more sophisticated films permeate. This is a very early Allen film and it is obvious that his true style that we see in his best works from the 80's and 90's is still in development. But you can't look at this film as a staunch comparison to other films that, at the time, hadn't even been conceived yet. You have to look at Sleeper on its own and understand that it is the work of a still learning Woody Allen who was still perfecting his wistful style of comedy and satire that we know and love today. I imagine that Woody Allen intended to be a slapstick comedy filmmaker before he realized what a talent he had for writing more sophisticated comedy. But while the slapstick phase lasted he really struck gold with Sleeper. I'm not even entirely sure why I liked this movie so much. I guess it is because it is just so much fun. Normally the silly comedies like this just seem to hold my attention for the time that they are playing, provide a few laughs, and nothing else. But Sleeper really hit a note with me and I was incredibly entertained and draw in how any comedy should draw you in. I was really entertained by the comedy but also enthralled by the incredibly entertaining storyline that is a perfect blend of slapstick, satire, and sci-fi. Woody Allen proves once again that he knows how to make a good film.

He is revived out of cryostatis 200 years into the future where the world is suppressed by a big brother type government. Miles only wants to go back to 1973, but he eventually gets involved with a rebellion against the government. This is a hilariously creative display of a pseudo-slapstick style of comedy with every situation and every moment of the film a laugh out loud and uproariously entertaining experience. While brimming with slapstick humor and physical comedy, Sleeper is also an excellent satire. The whole futuristic government satire idea is kind of burnt out by this point, but Sleeper shows itself off as one of the smarter examples of this motif in modern filmmaking. There are some hilarious moments, satirizing not so much the government, but more just society in general, like when it is revealed that things like chocolate and cigarettes are some of the most healthy products for the human body. This is even funnier when you account for the fact that Miles owned a health food store back in 1973 which only sold organic products. Miles makes various amusing comments about this throughout the film as well, making fun of society's obsession with eating healthy. The cleverness of this film is just so appeasing at times. Now I will say that this isn't the kind of high brow comedy that Woody Allen's more sophisticated films permeate. This is a very early Allen film and it is obvious that his true style that we see in his best works from the 80's and 90's is still in development. But you can't look at this film as a staunch comparison to other films that, at the time, hadn't even been conceived yet. You have to look at Sleeper on its own and understand that it is the work of a still learning Woody Allen who was still perfecting his wistful style of comedy and satire that we know and love today. I imagine that Woody Allen intended to be a slapstick comedy filmmaker before he realized what a talent he had for writing more sophisticated comedy. But while the slapstick phase lasted he really struck gold with Sleeper. I'm not even entirely sure why I liked this movie so much. I guess it is because it is just so much fun. Normally the silly comedies like this just seem to hold my attention for the time that they are playing, provide a few laughs, and nothing else. But Sleeper really hit a note with me and I was incredibly entertained and draw in how any comedy should draw you in. I was really entertained by the comedy but also enthralled by the incredibly entertaining storyline that is a perfect blend of slapstick, satire, and sci-fi. Woody Allen proves once again that he knows how to make a good film.

    Sleeper, (1973), ***&frac12;/****. In the year 2103 AD, Miles Monroe (Played By Woody Allen.) wakes up after 200 years, to find himself living in a world inhabited with giant bananas, and Orgazmatrons. He disguises as a butler robot to spy on The Aires Project run by the government. Sleeper is a very inventive film, and it proves that Woody Allen's attempt at a silent comedy works very well, and he would later go on to making Oscar winning dramas, like Annie Hall, and Manhattan. Sleeper is a fantastic Sci-Fi comedy, and I very highly recommend it. 9/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    "Sleeper" is packed with visual (at times it's almost like a tribute to silent comedy) and verbal gags, but personally I don't think it is quite as funny as "Bananas", or quite as imaginative as the best sketch (the closing one) of "Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Sex (But Were Afraid To Ask)" (although the orgasmatron and the shaving-mirror scene come close), and the ending feels rushed. However, it is a very important part in Woody Allen's evolution: up to that point, his films were mostly "Woody against the world"; here, he's dancing (metaphorically, but sometimes also literally!) with a partner - and what a partner! Diane Keaton, at her sexiest and fastest, is almost like a female Woody Allen at times - that's how well-synchronized their teamwork is. Woody is so confident of Keaton's abilities that he even gives her a couple of wild comic scenes all to herself, like her Tarzan imitation, and he sometimes lets himself become the butt of her jokes ("You're dealing with one of the greatest minds you've ever encountered" - "Yeah, and his isn't so bad either!"). Apart from their heavenly pairing, the strongest asset of "Sleeper" is its wonderful jazz score. *** out of 4.

    Woody Allen aka Mr.Cinema Delivers A Winner Once Again in his 1973 cult-classic 'Sleeper'. A Terrific Sci-Fi Comedy, that comes in-tact with a host of good laughs. 'Sleeper' Synopsis: A nerdish store owner is revived out of cryostasis into a future world to fight an oppressive government. 'Sleeper' is amazing work. Allen & Marshall Brickman's Screenplay is a work of genius. They come up with a terrific concept, which translates into an equally terrific film. Each & Everything works! Allen's Direction, As Always, is Awe-Inspiring. Cinematography by David M. Walsh is good. Editing & Art Design, are wonderful. Performance-Wise: Allen delivers a marvelous performance in the central role. He embodies the character & delivers one of his finest performances. He's a treat to watch from start to finish. Diane Keaton is ever-dependable. John Beck is first-rate. Susan Miller leaves a mark. Others lend support. On the whole, 'Sleeper' is simply, unmissable. Mr.Cinema RULES!

    A freezer-burned Woody Allen emerges from a lengthy cryogenic slumber to apply his own specific brand of humor to the late 22nd century. At times overly topical and horribly dated, this is really at its best as a flippant physical comedy. Even then, the puns and gags are stretched awfully thin, with blatantly sped-up footage and a ragtime soundtrack giving it the look and feel of a futuristic Benny Hill. Allen's pokes and prods about the evolution of society are occasionally good for a snicker, particularly the advent of technology supplanting our need for sex, drugs and organized religion, but the central storyline is so thin and inessential that the whole mess feels like a series of vaguely-related skits. The glut of weak, DIY-esque backdrops and special effects make the arrival of Star Wars just four years later seem even more impressive by comparison. Mildly silly at best and utterly dull at worst, it's not something I'll be revisiting again soon, if ever.

    Sleeper is probably the best of Woody Allen's early 'funny' films. It tells the tale of a health food shop owner from 1973 waking up in 2173 after being cryogenically frozen after a botched hospital operation. The set-up is ideal for Allen to incorporate both slapstick humour and satire. It also has a strong enough central story-line to hold everything together cohesively. Not only that but its sci-fi trappings allow for a visually inventive aesthetic which adds a further dimension. More than probably any of his other movies this one gives Allen equal opportunity to show his skills at physical, as well as verbal, comedy. I suppose because its a sci-fi comedy in addition to its lower-brow elements, Sleeper is one of the most accessible of Allen's works to many. But having said that, its hardly an unintelligent film, the future setting allows for a lot of satirical content, while the script is as sharp and funny as you would expect. Once again the chemistry between Allen and Diane Keaton is excellent. In this movie, the latter plays a spoilt, vacuous upper-class pseudo-intellectual. This character allows for a lot of verbal sparring with Allen's angsty New Yorker. There are many individual funny moments. Too many to list really. What the film as a whole represents is the peak of Allen's full-on funny films. In addition, its one of those rare sci-fi films in which the dated look of the 'futuristic' sets and costumes actually works to its advantage; they add to the overall humour. The very fact that its a genre picture though adds considerable interest in itself, as it allows the director to play around with a few conventions. And, most importantly, it remains one of his funniest films too, which counts for a lot.

    Here is a guy (Allen) who married his wife's adopted daughter, whom he helped raise from a little girl. Somehow they let him get away with this. He should be in jail. What a sick disgusting creep he is. This movie was a disappointment. Most jokes were either little-to-half intelligent groaners, inside jokes or pop culture references that most people today wouldn't catch or remember. The acting was quite amateur as was the movie as a whole. I was not in a good mood after watching this years ago, and I certainly will not watch any of that pervert's movies now.

    I never thought I would ever find slapstick humor funny, until I saw "Sleeper." When the security police of a "futuristic" totalitarian regime is falling all over themselves, and a bumbling health food store owner from our time can outsmart them, slapstick is funny. As funny as this movie is, it also has serious content. For one thing, it's scary that a bumbling health food store owner can outwit the security force. The people must be so docile that the security force is not used to doing anything. It's scary how dumb everyone else is in the society too - Diane Keeton's poetry is terrible, and none of the characters recognize Woody Allen when he is pretending to be a robot (his lack of disguise is immediately apparent to the movie viewer). We are also led by Allen's character to wonder how different we really are from the people of the "future" portrayed in the film. Allen is obviously smarter and more jaded than the inhabitants of the future, but he claims to be an existentialist and does not appear to value anything except survival and pleasure. This is similar to the people of the future, who live for the sole purpose of experiencing orgy machines and drug-like balls that they hold in their hands. Finally, the movie asks us to consider the question of what constitutes our wants/needs/desires. We are told that in the society of the future, these are all taken care of more efficiently than we would have ever thought possible. But it is plainly on view here that the wants/needs/desires of the people in the society of the future have been shaped by the society in which they live. Thus, the question arises - to what extent are our own desires shaped by ourselves? Of course, I wasn't thinking about any of this while I watched the film. I was too busy laughing.

    *** out of **** One of the outrageously funny slapstick comedies from Woody Allen's early career, and a good place to start for Allen newcomers looking for fun. Woody was becoming a much more polished director by this time. He plays the lead role of a health food store owner who went into the hospital for minor surgery in the 20th Century, but wakes up in the futuristic world of 2173 where technology is way over his head and the state is engaged in a revolution. He is reluctantly befriended by a skeptical Diane Keaton who first fears him as an alien before joining his mission to foil a major government plot. Keaton and Allen were teamed previously in PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM but they really have a strong comical team chemistry here and would go on to make several other films together, including the award winning ANNIE HALL. In SLEEPER you can easily see where Woody was influenced by great classic comedians he's idolized like Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, and The Marx Brothers. The film seems to slow down just a bit in the last act, but overall this is a delightful and crazy hodgepodge of silliness.

    Is there anything Woody Allen can't do? Woody Allen doing sci-fi? What? There's no way that could work, right? Wrong. Allen, in all of his neurotic genius, has created his own zany brand of sci-fi comedy. Of course it is all in the style of your typical Woody Allen film and sci-fi is more of a backdrop, but there is still no denying that Allen has wonderfully blended the two genres. Sleeper is a movie about Miles Monroe, played, of course, by Woody Allen. Miles was a whole foods store owner and clarinet player who died in 1973.

    Is there anything Woody Allen can't do? Woody Allen doing sci-fi? What? There's no way that could work, right? Wrong. Allen, in all of his neurotic genius, has created his own zany brand of sci-fi comedy. Of course it is all in the style of your typical Woody Allen film and sci-fi is more of a backdrop, but there is still no denying that Allen has wonderfully blended the two genres. Sleeper is a movie about Miles Monroe, played, of course, by Woody Allen. Miles was a whole foods store owner and clarinet player who died in 1973. He is revived out of cryostatis 200 years into the future where the world is suppressed by a big brother type government. Miles only wants to go back to 1973, but he eventually gets involved with a rebellion against the government. This is a hilariously creative display of a pseudo-slapstick style of comedy with every situation and every moment of the film a laugh out loud and uproariously entertaining experience. While brimming with slapstick humor and physical comedy, Sleeper is also an excellent satire. The whole futuristic government satire idea is kind of burnt out by this point, but Sleeper shows itself off as one of the smarter examples of this motif in modern filmmaking. There are some hilarious moments, satirizing not so much the government, but more just society in general, like when it is revealed that things like chocolate and cigarettes are some of the most healthy products for the human body. This is even funnier when you account for the fact that Miles owned a health food store back in 1973 which only sold organic products. Miles makes various amusing comments about this throughout the film as well, making fun of society's obsession with eating healthy. The cleverness of this film is just so appeasing at times. Now I will say that this isn't the kind of high brow comedy that Woody Allen's more sophisticated films permeate. This is a very early Allen film and it is obvious that his true style that we see in his best works from the 80's and 90's is still in development. But you can't look at this film as a staunch comparison to other films that, at the time, hadn't even been conceived yet. You have to look at Sleeper on its own and understand that it is the work of a still learning Woody Allen who was still perfecting his wistful style of comedy and satire that we know and love today. I imagine that Woody Allen intended to be a slapstick comedy filmmaker before he realized what a talent he had for writing more sophisticated comedy. But while the slapstick phase lasted he really struck gold with Sleeper. I'm not even entirely sure why I liked this movie so much. I guess it is because it is just so much fun. Normally the silly comedies like this just seem to hold my attention for the time that they are playing, provide a few laughs, and nothing else. But Sleeper really hit a note with me and I was incredibly entertained and draw in how any comedy should draw you in. I was really entertained by the comedy but also enthralled by the incredibly entertaining storyline that is a perfect blend of slapstick, satire, and sci-fi. Woody Allen proves once again that he knows how to make a good film.

    Sleeper, (1973), ***&frac12;/****. In the year 2103 AD, Miles Monroe (Played By Woody Allen.) wakes up after 200 years, to find himself living in a world inhabited with giant bananas, and Orgazmatrons. He disguises as a butler robot to spy on The Aires Project run by the government. Sleeper is a very inventive film, and it proves that Woody Allen's attempt at a silent comedy works very well, and he would later go on to making Oscar winning dramas, like Annie Hall, and Manhattan. Sleeper is a fantastic Sci-Fi comedy, and I very highly recommend it. 9/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    "Sleeper" is packed with visual (at times it's almost like a tribute to silent comedy) and verbal gags, but personally I don't think it is quite as funny as "Bananas", or quite as imaginative as the best sketch (the closing one) of "Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Sex (But Were Afraid To Ask)" (although the orgasmatron and the shaving-mirror scene come close), and the ending feels rushed. However, it is a very important part in Woody Allen's evolution: up to that point, his films were mostly "Woody against the world"; here, he's dancing (metaphorically, but sometimes also literally!) with a partner - and what a partner! Diane Keaton, at her sexiest and fastest, is almost like a female Woody Allen at times - that's how well-synchronized their teamwork is. Woody is so confident of Keaton's abilities that he even gives her a couple of wild comic scenes all to herself, like her Tarzan imitation, and he sometimes lets himself become the butt of her jokes ("You're dealing with one of the greatest minds you've ever encountered" - "Yeah, and his isn't so bad either!"). Apart from their heavenly pairing, the strongest asset of "Sleeper" is its wonderful jazz score. *** out of 4.

    Woody Allen aka Mr.Cinema Delivers A Winner Once Again in his 1973 cult-classic 'Sleeper'. A Terrific Sci-Fi Comedy, that comes in-tact with a host of good laughs. 'Sleeper' Synopsis: A nerdish store owner is revived out of cryostasis into a future world to fight an oppressive government. 'Sleeper' is amazing work. Allen & Marshall Brickman's Screenplay is a work of genius. They come up with a terrific concept, which translates into an equally terrific film. Each & Everything works! Allen's Direction, As Always, is Awe-Inspiring. Cinematography by David M. Walsh is good. Editing & Art Design, are wonderful. Performance-Wise: Allen delivers a marvelous performance in the central role. He embodies the character & delivers one of his finest performances. He's a treat to watch from start to finish. Diane Keaton is ever-dependable. John Beck is first-rate. Susan Miller leaves a mark. Others lend support. On the whole, 'Sleeper' is simply, unmissable. Mr.Cinema RULES!

    A freezer-burned Woody Allen emerges from a lengthy cryogenic slumber to apply his own specific brand of humor to the late 22nd century. At times overly topical and horribly dated, this is really at its best as a flippant physical comedy. Even then, the puns and gags are stretched awfully thin, with blatantly sped-up footage and a ragtime soundtrack giving it the look and feel of a futuristic Benny Hill. Allen's pokes and prods about the evolution of society are occasionally good for a snicker, particularly the advent of technology supplanting our need for sex, drugs and organized religion, but the central storyline is so thin and inessential that the whole mess feels like a series of vaguely-related skits. The glut of weak, DIY-esque backdrops and special effects make the arrival of Star Wars just four years later seem even more impressive by comparison. Mildly silly at best and utterly dull at worst, it's not something I'll be revisiting again soon, if ever.

    Sleeper is probably the best of Woody Allen's early 'funny' films. It tells the tale of a health food shop owner from 1973 waking up in 2173 after being cryogenically frozen after a botched hospital operation. The set-up is ideal for Allen to incorporate both slapstick humour and satire. It also has a strong enough central story-line to hold everything together cohesively. Not only that but its sci-fi trappings allow for a visually inventive aesthetic which adds a further dimension. More than probably any of his other movies this one gives Allen equal opportunity to show his skills at physical, as well as verbal, comedy. I suppose because its a sci-fi comedy in addition to its lower-brow elements, Sleeper is one of the most accessible of Allen's works to many. But having said that, its hardly an unintelligent film, the future setting allows for a lot of satirical content, while the script is as sharp and funny as you would expect. Once again the chemistry between Allen and Diane Keaton is excellent. In this movie, the latter plays a spoilt, vacuous upper-class pseudo-intellectual. This character allows for a lot of verbal sparring with Allen's angsty New Yorker. There are many individual funny moments. Too many to list really. What the film as a whole represents is the peak of Allen's full-on funny films. In addition, its one of those rare sci-fi films in which the dated look of the 'futuristic' sets and costumes actually works to its advantage; they add to the overall humour. The very fact that its a genre picture though adds considerable interest in itself, as it allows the director to play around with a few conventions. And, most importantly, it remains one of his funniest films too, which counts for a lot.

    Here is a guy (Allen) who married his wife's adopted daughter, whom he helped raise from a little girl. Somehow they let him get away with this. He should be in jail. What a sick disgusting creep he is. This movie was a disappointment. Most jokes were either little-to-half intelligent groaners, inside jokes or pop culture references that most people today wouldn't catch or remember. The acting was quite amateur as was the movie as a whole. I was not in a good mood after watching this years ago, and I certainly will not watch any of that pervert's movies now.

    I never thought I would ever find slapstick humor funny, until I saw "Sleeper." When the security police of a "futuristic" totalitarian regime is falling all over themselves, and a bumbling health food store owner from our time can outsmart them, slapstick is funny. As funny as this movie is, it also has serious content. For one thing, it's scary that a bumbling health food store owner can outwit the security force. The people must be so docile that the security force is not used to doing anything. It's scary how dumb everyone else is in the society too - Diane Keeton's poetry is terrible, and none of the characters recognize Woody Allen when he is pretending to be a robot (his lack of disguise is immediately apparent to the movie viewer). We are also led by Allen's character to wonder how different we really are from the people of the "future" portrayed in the film. Allen is obviously smarter and more jaded than the inhabitants of the future, but he claims to be an existentialist and does not appear to value anything except survival and pleasure. This is similar to the people of the future, who live for the sole purpose of experiencing orgy machines and drug-like balls that they hold in their hands. Finally, the movie asks us to consider the question of what constitutes our wants/needs/desires. We are told that in the society of the future, these are all taken care of more efficiently than we would have ever thought possible. But it is plainly on view here that the wants/needs/desires of the people in the society of the future have been shaped by the society in which they live. Thus, the question arises - to what extent are our own desires shaped by ourselves? Of course, I wasn't thinking about any of this while I watched the film. I was too busy laughing.

    *** out of **** One of the outrageously funny slapstick comedies from Woody Allen's early career, and a good place to start for Allen newcomers looking for fun. Woody was becoming a much more polished director by this time. He plays the lead role of a health food store owner who went into the hospital for minor surgery in the 20th Century, but wakes up in the futuristic world of 2173 where technology is way over his head and the state is engaged in a revolution. He is reluctantly befriended by a skeptical Diane Keaton who first fears him as an alien before joining his mission to foil a major government plot. Keaton and Allen were teamed previously in PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM but they really have a strong comical team chemistry here and would go on to make several other films together, including the award winning ANNIE HALL. In SLEEPER you can easily see where Woody was influenced by great classic comedians he's idolized like Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, and The Marx Brothers. The film seems to slow down just a bit in the last act, but overall this is a delightful and crazy hodgepodge of silliness.

    Is there anything Woody Allen can't do? Woody Allen doing sci-fi? What? There's no way that could work, right? Wrong. Allen, in all of his neurotic genius, has created his own zany brand of sci-fi comedy. Of course it is all in the style of your typical Woody Allen film and sci-fi is more of a backdrop, but there is still no denying that Allen has wonderfully blended the two genres. Sleeper is a movie about Miles Monroe, played, of course, by Woody Allen. Miles was a whole foods store owner and clarinet player who died in 1973. He is revived out of cryostatis 200 years into the future where the world is suppressed by a big brother type government. Miles only wants to go back to 1973, but he eventually gets involved with a rebellion against the government. This is a hilariously creative display of a pseudo-slapstick style of comedy with every situation and every moment of the film a laugh out loud and uproariously entertaining experience. While brimming with slapstick humor and physical comedy, Sleeper is also an excellent satire. The whole futuristic government satire idea is kind of burnt out by this point, but Sleeper shows itself off as one of the smarter examples of this motif in modern filmmaking. There are some hilarious moments, satirizing not so much the government, but more just society in general, like when it is revealed that things like chocolate and cigarettes are some of the most healthy products for the human body. This is even funnier when you account for the fact that Miles owned a health food store back in 1973 which only sold organic products. Miles makes various amusing comments about this throughout the film as well, making fun of society's obsession with eating healthy. The cleverness of this film is just so appeasing at times. Now I will say that this isn't the kind of high brow comedy that Woody Allen's more sophisticated films permeate. This is a very early Allen film and it is obvious that his true style that we see in his best works from the 80's and 90's is still in development. But you can't look at this film as a staunch comparison to other films that, at the time, hadn't even been conceived yet. You have to look at Sleeper on its own and understand that it is the work of a still learning Woody Allen who was still perfecting his wistful style of comedy and satire that we know and love today. I imagine that Woody Allen intended to be a slapstick comedy filmmaker before he realized what a talent he had for writing more sophisticated comedy. But while the slapstick phase lasted he really struck gold with Sleeper. I'm not even entirely sure why I liked this movie so much. I guess it is because it is just so much fun. Normally the silly comedies like this just seem to hold my attention for the time that they are playing, provide a few laughs, and nothing else. But Sleeper really hit a note with me and I was incredibly entertained and draw in how any comedy should draw you in. I was really entertained by the comedy but also enthralled by the incredibly entertaining storyline that is a perfect blend of slapstick, satire, and sci-fi. Woody Allen proves once again that he knows how to make a good film.

    Sleeper, (1973), ***&frac12;/****. In the year 2103 AD, Miles Monroe (Played By Woody Allen.) wakes up after 200 years, to find himself living in a world inhabited with giant bananas, and Orgazmatrons. He disguises as a butler robot to spy on The Aires Project run by the government. Sleeper is a very inventive film, and it proves that Woody Allen's attempt at a silent comedy works very well, and he would later go on to making Oscar winning dramas, like Annie Hall, and Manhattan. Sleeper is a fantastic Sci-Fi comedy, and I very highly recommend it. 9/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    "Sleeper" is packed with visual (at times it's almost like a tribute to silent comedy) and verbal gags, but personally I don't think it is quite as funny as "Bananas", or quite as imaginative as the best sketch (the closing one) of "Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Sex (But Were Afraid To Ask)" (although the orgasmatron and the shaving-mirror scene come close), and the ending feels rushed. However, it is a very important part in Woody Allen's evolution: up to that point, his films were mostly "Woody against the world"; here, he's dancing (metaphorically, but sometimes also literally!) with a partner - and what a partner! Diane Keaton, at her sexiest and fastest, is almost like a female Woody Allen at times - that's how well-synchronized their teamwork is. Woody is so confident of Keaton's abilities that he even gives her a couple of wild comic scenes all to herself, like her Tarzan imitation, and he sometimes lets himself become the butt of her jokes ("You're dealing with one of the greatest minds you've ever encountered" - "Yeah, and his isn't so bad either!"). Apart from their heavenly pairing, the strongest asset of "Sleeper" is its wonderful jazz score. *** out of 4.

    Woody Allen aka Mr.Cinema Delivers A Winner Once Again in his 1973 cult-classic 'Sleeper'. A Terrific Sci-Fi Comedy, that comes in-tact with a host of good laughs. 'Sleeper' Synopsis: A nerdish store owner is revived out of cryostasis into a future world to fight an oppressive government. 'Sleeper' is amazing work. Allen & Marshall Brickman's Screenplay is a work of genius. They come up with a terrific concept, which translates into an equally terrific film. Each & Everything works! Allen's Direction, As Always, is Awe-Inspiring. Cinematography by David M. Walsh is good. Editing & Art Design, are wonderful. Performance-Wise: Allen delivers a marvelous performance in the central role. He embodies the character & delivers one of his finest performances. He's a treat to watch from start to finish. Diane Keaton is ever-dependable. John Beck is first-rate. Susan Miller leaves a mark. Others lend support. On the whole, 'Sleeper' is simply, unmissable. Mr.Cinema RULES!

    A freezer-burned Woody Allen emerges from a lengthy cryogenic slumber to apply his own specific brand of humor to the late 22nd century. At times overly topical and horribly dated, this is really at its best as a flippant physical comedy. Even then, the puns and gags are stretched awfully thin, with blatantly sped-up footage and a ragtime soundtrack giving it the look and feel of a futuristic Benny Hill. Allen's pokes and prods about the evolution of society are occasionally good for a snicker, particularly the advent of technology supplanting our need for sex, drugs and organized religion, but the central storyline is so thin and inessential that the whole mess feels like a series of vaguely-related skits. The glut of weak, DIY-esque backdrops and special effects make the arrival of Star Wars just four years later seem even more impressive by comparison. Mildly silly at best and utterly dull at worst, it's not something I'll be revisiting again soon, if ever.

    Sleeper is probably the best of Woody Allen's early 'funny' films. It tells the tale of a health food shop owner from 1973 waking up in 2173 after being cryogenically frozen after a botched hospital operation. The set-up is ideal for Allen to incorporate both slapstick humour and satire. It also has a strong enough central story-line to hold everything together cohesively. Not only that but its sci-fi trappings allow for a visually inventive aesthetic which adds a further dimension. More than probably any of his other movies this one gives Allen equal opportunity to show his skills at physical, as well as verbal, comedy. I suppose because its a sci-fi comedy in addition to its lower-brow elements, Sleeper is one of the most accessible of Allen's works to many. But having said that, its hardly an unintelligent film, the future setting allows for a lot of satirical content, while the script is as sharp and funny as you would expect. Once again the chemistry between Allen and Diane Keaton is excellent. In this movie, the latter plays a spoilt, vacuous upper-class pseudo-intellectual. This character allows for a lot of verbal sparring with Allen's angsty New Yorker. There are many individual funny moments. Too many to list really. What the film as a whole represents is the peak of Allen's full-on funny films. In addition, its one of those rare sci-fi films in which the dated look of the 'futuristic' sets and costumes actually works to its advantage; they add to the overall humour. The very fact that its a genre picture though adds considerable interest in itself, as it allows the director to play around with a few conventions. And, most importantly, it remains one of his funniest films too, which counts for a lot.

    Here is a guy (Allen) who married his wife's adopted daughter, whom he helped raise from a little girl. Somehow they let him get away with this. He should be in jail. What a sick disgusting creep he is. This movie was a disappointment. Most jokes were either little-to-half intelligent groaners, inside jokes or pop culture references that most people today wouldn't catch or remember. The acting was quite amateur as was the movie as a whole. I was not in a good mood after watching this years ago, and I certainly will not watch any of that pervert's movies now. If you like movies made by a child-molester, be my guest...

    I never thought I would ever find slapstick humor funny, until I saw "Sleeper." When the security police of a "futuristic" totalitarian regime is falling all over themselves, and a bumbling health food store owner from our time can outsmart them, slapstick is funny. As funny as this movie is, it also has serious content. For one thing, it's scary that a bumbling health food store owner can outwit the security force. The people must be so docile that the security force is not used to doing anything. It's scary how dumb everyone else is in the society too - Diane Keeton's poetry is terrible, and none of the characters recognize Woody Allen when he is pretending to be a robot (his lack of disguise is immediately apparent to the movie viewer). We are also led by Allen's character to wonder how different we really are from the people of the "future" portrayed in the film. Allen is obviously smarter and more jaded than the inhabitants of the future, but he claims to be an existentialist and does not appear to value anything except survival and pleasure. This is similar to the people of the future, who live for the sole purpose of experiencing orgy machines and drug-like balls that they hold in their hands. Finally, the movie asks us to consider the question of what constitutes our wants/needs/desires. We are told that in the society of the future, these are all taken care of more efficiently than we would have ever thought possible. But it is plainly on view here that the wants/needs/desires of the people in the society of the future have been shaped by the society in which they live. Thus, the question arises - to what extent are our own desires shaped by ourselves? Of course, I wasn't thinking about any of this while I watched the film. I was too busy laughing.

    *** out of **** One of the outrageously funny slapstick comedies from Woody Allen's early career, and a good place to start for Allen newcomers looking for fun. Woody was becoming a much more polished director by this time. He plays the lead role of a health food store owner who went into the hospital for minor surgery in the 20th Century, but wakes up in the futuristic world of 2173 where technology is way over his head and the state is engaged in a revolution. He is reluctantly befriended by a skeptical Diane Keaton who first fears him as an alien before joining his mission to foil a major government plot. Keaton and Allen were teamed previously in PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM but they really have a strong comical team chemistry here and would go on to make several other films together, including the award winning ANNIE HALL. In SLEEPER you can easily see where Woody was influenced by great classic comedians he's idolized like Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, and The Marx Brothers. The film seems to slow down just a bit in the last act, but overall this is a delightful and crazy hodgepodge of silliness.

In SLEEPER you can easily see where Woody was influenced by great classic comedians he's idolized like Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, and The Marx Brothers. The film seems to slow down just a bit in the last act, but overall this is a delightful and crazy hodgepodge of silliness.

    Is there anything Woody Allen can't do? Woody Allen doing sci-fi? What? There's no way that could work, right? Wrong. Allen, in all of his neurotic genius, has created his own zany brand of sci-fi comedy. Of course it is all in the style of your typical Woody Allen film and sci-fi is more of a backdrop, but there is still no denying that Allen has wonderfully blended the two genres. Sleeper is a movie about Miles Monroe, played, of course, by Woody Allen. Miles was a whole foods store owner and clarinet player who died in 1973. He is revived out of cryostatis 200 years into the future where the world is suppressed by a big brother type government. Miles only wants to go back to 1973, but he eventually gets involved with a rebellion against the government. This is a hilariously creative display of a pseudo-slapstick style of comedy with every situation and every moment of the film a laugh out loud and uproariously entertaining experience. While brimming with slapstick humor and physical comedy, Sleeper is also an excellent satire. The whole futuristic government satire idea is kind of burnt out by this point, but Sleeper shows itself off as one of the smarter examples of this motif in modern filmmaking. There are some hilarious moments, satirizing not so much the government, but more just society in general, like when it is revealed that things like chocolate and cigarettes are some of the most healthy products for the human body. This is even funnier when you account for the fact that Miles owned a health food store back in 1973 which only sold organic products. Miles makes various amusing comments about this throughout the film as well, making fun of society's obsession with eating healthy. The cleverness of this film is just so appeasing at times. Now I will say that this isn't the kind of high brow comedy that Woody Allen's more sophisticated films permeate. This is a very early Allen film and it is obvious that his true style that we see in his best works from the 80's and 90's is still in development. But you can't look at this film as a staunch comparison to other films that, at the time, hadn't even been conceived yet. You have to look at Sleeper on its own and understand that it is the work of a still learning Woody Allen who was still perfecting his wistful style of comedy and satire that we know and love today. I imagine that Woody Allen intended to be a slapstick comedy filmmaker before he realized what a talent he had for writing more sophisticated comedy. But while the slapstick phase lasted he really struck gold with Sleeper. I'm not even entirely sure why I liked this movie so much. I guess it is because it is just so much fun. Normally the silly comedies like this just seem to hold my attention for the time that they are playing, provide a few laughs, and nothing else. But Sleeper really hit a note with me and I was incredibly entertained and draw in how any comedy should draw you in. I was really entertained by the comedy but also enthralled by the incredibly entertaining storyline that is a perfect blend of slapstick, satire, and sci-fi. Woody Allen proves once again that he knows how to make a good film.

    Sleeper, (1973), ***&frac12;/****. In the year 2103 AD, Miles Monroe (Played By Woody Allen.) wakes up after 200 years, to find himself living in a world inhabited with giant bananas, and Orgazmatrons. He disguises as a butler robot to spy on The Aires Project run by the government. Sleeper is a very inventive film, and it proves that Woody Allen's attempt at a silent comedy works very well, and he would later go on to making Oscar winning dramas, like Annie Hall, and Manhattan. Sleeper is a fantastic Sci-Fi comedy, and I very highly recommend it. 9/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    "Sleeper" is packed with visual (at times it's almost like a tribute to silent comedy) and verbal gags, but personally I don't think it is quite as funny as "Bananas", or quite as imaginative as the best sketch (the closing one) of "Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Sex (But Were Afraid To Ask)" (although the orgasmatron and the shaving-mirror scene come close), and the ending feels rushed. However, it is a very important part in Woody Allen's evolution: up to that point, his films were mostly "Woody against the world"; here, he's dancing (metaphorically, but sometimes also literally!) with a partner - and what a partner! Diane Keaton, at her sexiest and fastest, is almost like a female Woody Allen at times - that's how well-synchronized their teamwork is. Woody is so confident of Keaton's abilities that he even gives her a couple of wild comic scenes all to herself, like her Tarzan imitation, and he sometimes lets himself become the butt of her jokes ("You're dealing with one of the greatest minds you've ever encountered" - "Yeah, and his isn't so bad either!"). Apart from their heavenly pairing, the strongest asset of "Sleeper" is its wonderful jazz score. *** out of 4.

    Woody Allen aka Mr.Cinema Delivers A Winner Once Again in his 1973 cult-classic 'Sleeper'. A Terrific Sci-Fi Comedy, that comes in-tact with a host of good laughs. 'Sleeper' Synopsis: A nerdish store owner is revived out of cryostasis into a future world to fight an oppressive government. 'Sleeper' is amazing work. Allen & Marshall Brickman's Screenplay is a work of genius. They come up with a terrific concept, which translates into an equally terrific film. Each & Everything works! Allen's Direction, As Always, is Awe-Inspiring. Cinematography by David M. Walsh is good. Editing & Art Design, are wonderful. Performance-Wise: Allen delivers a marvelous performance in the central role. He embodies the character & delivers one of his finest performances. He's a treat to watch from start to finish. Diane Keaton is ever-dependable. John Beck is first-rate. Susan Miller leaves a mark. Others lend support. On the whole, 'Sleeper' is simply, unmissable. Mr.Cinema RULES!

    A freezer-burned Woody Allen emerges from a lengthy cryogenic slumber to apply his own specific brand of humor to the late 22nd century. At times overly topical and horribly dated, this is really at its best as a flippant physical comedy. Even then, the puns and gags are stretched awfully thin, with blatantly sped-up footage and a ragtime soundtrack giving it the look and feel of a futuristic Benny Hill. Allen's pokes and prods about the evolution of society are occasionally good for a snicker, particularly the advent of technology supplanting our need for sex, drugs and organized religion, but the central storyline is so thin and inessential that the whole mess feels like a series of vaguely-related skits. The glut of weak, DIY-esque backdrops and special effects make the arrival of Star Wars just four years later seem even more impressive by comparison. Mildly silly at best and utterly dull at worst, it's not something I'll be revisiting again soon, if ever.

    Sleeper is probably the best of Woody Allen's early 'funny' films. It tells the tale of a health food shop owner from 1973 waking up in 2173 after being cryogenically frozen after a botched hospital operation. The set-up is ideal for Allen to incorporate both slapstick humour and satire. It also has a strong enough central story-line to hold everything together cohesively. Not only that but its sci-fi trappings allow for a visually inventive aesthetic which adds a further dimension. More than probably any of his other movies this one gives Allen equal opportunity to show his skills at physical, as well as verbal, comedy. I suppose because its a sci-fi comedy in addition to its lower-brow elements, Sleeper is one of the most accessible of Allen's works to many. But having said that, its hardly an unintelligent film, the future setting allows for a lot of satirical content, while the script is as sharp and funny as you would expect. Once again the chemistry between Allen and Diane Keaton is excellent. In this movie, the latter plays a spoilt, vacuous upper-class pseudo-intellectual. This character allows for a lot of verbal sparring with Allen's angsty New Yorker. There are many individual funny moments. Too many to list really. What the film as a whole represents is the peak of Allen's full-on funny films. In addition, its one of those rare sci-fi films in which the dated look of the 'futuristic' sets and costumes actually works to its advantage; they add to the overall humour. The very fact that its a genre picture though adds considerable interest in itself, as it allows the director to play around with a few conventions. And, most importantly, it remains one of his funniest films too, which counts for a lot.

    Here is a guy (Allen) who married his wife's adopted daughter, whom he helped raise from a little girl. Somehow they let him get away with this. He should be in jail. What a sick disgusting creep he is. This movie was a disappointment. Most jokes were either little-to-half intelligent groaners, inside jokes or pop culture references that most people today wouldn't catch or remember. The acting was quite amateur as was the movie as a whole. I was not in a good mood after watching this years ago, and I certainly will not watch any of that pervert's movies now.

    I never thought I would ever find slapstick humor funny, until I saw "Sleeper." When the security police of a "futuristic" totalitarian regime is falling all over themselves, and a bumbling health food store owner from our time can outsmart them, slapstick is funny. As funny as this movie is, it also has serious content. For one thing, it's scary that a bumbling health food store owner can outwit the security force. The people must be so docile that the security force is not used to doing anything. It's scary how dumb everyone else is in the society too - Diane Keeton's poetry is terrible, and none of the characters recognize Woody Allen when he is pretending to be a robot (his lack of disguise is immediately apparent to the movie viewer). We are also led by Allen's character to wonder how different we really are from the people of the "future" portrayed in the film. Allen is obviously smarter and more jaded than the inhabitants of the future, but he claims to be an existentialist and does not appear to value anything except survival and pleasure. This is similar to the people of the future, who live for the sole purpose of experiencing orgy machines and drug-like balls that they hold in their hands. Finally, the movie asks us to consider the question of what constitutes our wants/needs/desires. We are told that in the society of the future, these are all taken care of more efficiently than we would have ever thought possible. But it is plainly on view here that the wants/needs/desires of the people in the society of the future have been shaped by the society in which they live. Thus, the question arises - to what extent are our own desires shaped by ourselves? Of course, I wasn't thinking about any of this while I watched the film. I was too busy laughing.

    *** out of **** One of the outrageously funny slapstick comedies from Woody Allen's early career, and a good place to start for Allen newcomers looking for fun. Woody was becoming a much more polished director by this time. He plays the lead role of a health food store owner who went into the hospital for minor surgery in the 20th Century, but wakes up in the futuristic world of 2173 where technology is way over his head and the state is engaged in a revolution. He is reluctantly befriended by a skeptical Diane Keaton who first fears him as an alien before joining his mission to foil a major government plot. Keaton and Allen were teamed previously in PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM but they really have a strong comical team chemistry here and would go on to make several other films together, including the award winning ANNIE HALL.

He plays the lead role of a health food store owner who went into the hospital for minor surgery in the 20th Century, but wakes up in the futuristic world of 2173 where technology is way over his head and the state is engaged in a revolution. He is reluctantly befriended by a skeptical Diane Keaton who first fears him as an alien before joining his mission to foil a major government plot. Keaton and Allen were teamed previously in PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM but they really have a strong comical team chemistry here and would go on to make several other films together, including the award winning ANNIE HALL. In SLEEPER you can easily see where Woody was influenced by great classic comedians he's idolized like Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, and The Marx Brothers. The film seems to slow down just a bit in the last act, but overall this is a delightful and crazy hodgepodge of silliness.

    Is there anything Woody Allen can't do? Woody Allen doing sci-fi? What? There's no way that could work, right? Wrong. Allen, in all of his neurotic genius, has created his own zany brand of sci-fi comedy. Of course it is all in the style of your typical Woody Allen film and sci-fi is more of a backdrop, but there is still no denying that Allen has wonderfully blended the two genres. Sleeper is a movie about Miles Monroe, played, of course, by Woody Allen. Miles was a whole foods store owner and clarinet player who died in 1973. He is revived out of cryostatis 200 years into the future where the world is suppressed by a big brother type government. Miles only wants to go back to 1973, but he eventually gets involved with a rebellion against the government. This is a hilariously creative display of a pseudo-slapstick style of comedy with every situation and every moment of the film a laugh out loud and uproariously entertaining experience. While brimming with slapstick humor and physical comedy, Sleeper is also an excellent satire. The whole futuristic government satire idea is kind of burnt out by this point, but Sleeper shows itself off as one of the smarter examples of this motif in modern filmmaking. There are some hilarious moments, satirizing not so much the government, but more just society in general, like when it is revealed that things like chocolate and cigarettes are some of the most healthy products for the human body. This is even funnier when you account for the fact that Miles owned a health food store back in 1973 which only sold organic products. Miles makes various amusing comments about this throughout the film as well, making fun of society's obsession with eating healthy. The cleverness of this film is just so appeasing at times. Now I will say that this isn't the kind of high brow comedy that Woody Allen's more sophisticated films permeate. This is a very early Allen film and it is obvious that his true style that we see in his best works from the 80's and 90's is still in development. But you can't look at this film as a staunch comparison to other films that, at the time, hadn't even been conceived yet. You have to look at Sleeper on its own and understand that it is the work of a still learning Woody Allen who was still perfecting his wistful style of comedy and satire that we know and love today. I imagine that Woody Allen intended to be a slapstick comedy filmmaker before he realized what a talent he had for writing more sophisticated comedy. But while the slapstick phase lasted he really struck gold with Sleeper. I'm not even entirely sure why I liked this movie so much. I guess it is because it is just so much fun. Normally the silly comedies like this just seem to hold my attention for the time that they are playing, provide a few laughs, and nothing else. But Sleeper really hit a note with me and I was incredibly entertained and draw in how any comedy should draw you in. I was really entertained by the comedy but also enthralled by the incredibly entertaining storyline that is a perfect blend of slapstick, satire, and sci-fi. Woody Allen proves once again that he knows how to make a good film.
