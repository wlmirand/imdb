 <sinopse>
  When an expedition to the African Congo ends in disaster, a new team is assembled to find out what went wrong.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  A megalomaniac C.E.O. sends his son into the dangerous African Congo on a quest for a source of diamonds large enough and pure enough to function as powerful laser communications transmitters (or is it laser weapons?). When contact is lost with his son and the team, his sometime daughter- in-law is sent after them. She is a former CIA operative and, accompanied by gee-whiz gadgetry and a few eccentric characters (including a mercenary, a researcher with a talking gorilla, and a a nutty Indiana-Jones-type looking for King Solomon's Mines), sets out to rescue her former fianc&eacute;. What they all discover is that often what we most want turns out to be the source of our downfall.

    Based on Michael Crichton's novel, film is about a research/rescue team sent into the African Congo, and led by Dr. Karen Ross(Laura Linney) that includes Dr. Peter Elliot(Dylan Walsh) who has with him a talking gorilla(due to a new technology in her larynx). Tim Curry and Ernie Hudson play devious characters who are also along for the mission. They are sent to locate the first research team that had apparently located some large and pure diamonds that are worth a fortune to the company funding the expeditions. Complicating matters are the instability of the local government, and a rumored mythical race of apes said to live deep in the jungle. As it turns out, they are no myth... Lightweight adventure yarn is watchable to a point, but too silly and outlandish to succeed, though it remains innocuous.

    It's not clear whether this bone-brained B-movie adventure is a spoof, an homage or a straight-faced misfire, but it's not much fun whichever way you look at it. Based on Michael Crichton's so-so novel, it's a nutty mixture of lost cities, giant hippos, monster monkeys, unconvincing visual effects and corny dialogue. The first sign that the movie isn't going to work is the gorilla that communicates in sign language, and needless to say the film doesn't get any better from that point on. Making all this old rope somewhat worthwhile are Tim Curry, feverishly hamming it up with a bizarre accent that defies identification, and Ernie Hudson, who also seems aware that this is all a load of old rubbish.

    The movie Congo is hushedly giantly appealing; Congo's viewing is very attractive for some reasons. Congo has these beautiful landscapes with great 'geothermal' colors, first-class budgeted production effects, and an awesomely themed story about killer gorillas, silver, killer gorillas at that. People are profoundly interested in the great apes, curious to know their ways, how smart that they are, and if they're dangerous or not. Congo interests in that. Also, Congo's a gentle, unmalicious viewing which so helps in strengthening its gorier moments, and it's backed by a drastically popular novel, oh, and it has lava! All this, and what else, makes it very largely appealing. Ooo! Ooo! I know what else! The beautiful Laura Linney! I can't forget about her! She's, really like, perfect, for the part. This is Linney's great starring role in Congo. I think she knocked it out of the park. Laura is more infatuating in a leading role than she is in her supporting roles even. Once the team gets to the Congo, Congo starts getting better. If you're expecting some Hollywood blockbuster typical-type movie, you're not gonna get it here. Is it just me, or do gorilla suits look exactly like real gorillas?

    It doesn't deserve any special attention, obviously not for any redeeming qualities but nor is it particularly bad either. Don't take me wrong, it does miss the mark almost entirely, although the budget can be clearly seen throughout from the star-studded cast to the various and elaborate set designs. The special effects are OK too; what this movie lacks is any kind of imagination or shred of originality to lift it up from it's generic trappings that most mediocre movies fall victim to. A movie about killer apes, it's gotta be at least kind of cool, right? There is maybe about fifteen minutes of screen time that even involves said killer apes, let alone shows them, and it is (of course) wedged somewhere in to the latter portion of the third act. There is a friendly gorilla who is a consistent character throughout the movie. Amy, the "talking gorilla", is about the only thing (besides Tim Curry) that won me over, but after about the first hour, it actually begins to feel like a movie about people with a gorilla character, not a movie about gorillas. You know the kind of bad movie in which after a long while, you notice it's just been different scenes of the characters talking to each other the whole time, well after it should have started to deliver? Yeah, if you've seen a lot of movies, you know what I mean. Congo could have easily had about twenty minutes shaved off, being stuffed full of useless and distracting development. My review (if accepted, after I write this) will likely be wedged somewhere in the back, never to be read by anyone else who grew up with the name Congo in the back of their mind and are curious about that 90s blockbuster about killer apes, and will be put behind the apparently favored "it's fun to watch" reviews, but let at least one person tell you; it's silly, it's convoluted and pointless, it's disappointing. It just kind of insults your intelligence and for the time period that it came out, it could have been at least a little better.

    Here is my personal review of the 1995 science-fiction/adventure film "Congo," directed by Frank Marshall and produced by Kathleen Kennedy, based on the novel by "Jurassic Park" author Michael Crichton. To start this off, I'll lay down the basic plot of the movie: TraviCom is a major electronics/telecommunications company based in Houston, Texas that sends an expedition to the Congo rain forest in Africa. The expedition's goal is to search for a deposit of extremely valuable, rare diamonds that, in the hands of TraviCom, will change the telecommunications industry overnight. However, SOMETHING slaughters the entire expedition party, and that includes the son of the company CEO that TraviCom employee Karen Ross loves. At the insistence of her boss, Karen Ross links up with Peter Elliot, a California primatetologist and his female gorilla, Amy (whom Peter has taught to paint and speak sign language with the help of an electronic glove). Once the new expedition reaches Africa, they bring on board Monroe Kelly, a "great white hunter who happens to be black" and a Romanian philanthropist named Herkemer Homolka. The expedition faces its fare share of obstacles before finally reaching its destination; the fabled lost city of Zinj, home to the same rare diamonds that the first TraviCom expedition was looking for. Unfortunately for the protagonists, the city of Zinj is home to something deadly: genetically mutated carnivorous gray gorillas, created and trained by the ancient people of Zinj to guard the valuable diamonds. Once the gray gorillas make themselves known, the explorers learn that in the African Congo, YOU ARE THE ENDANGERED SPECIES! If you love Michael Crichton or any movie that takes place in the jungle, this is the movie for you! The story is a well-translated yet slightly different telling of Crichton's story. The characters are well-defined and the acting is on a scale of 1 to 10, a 7. The late special-effects wizard Stan Winston uses amazing, realistic costumes with animatronic masks to breathe life into the signing gorilla Amy and the terrifying gray gorillas. Amy herself is a great character brought to life by both Stan Winston's robotic ape mask and the suit performer who brought out Amy's signing skills out really well. All in all, I love this movie, and everyone who gave it a negative review needs to find a better line of work! Most of "Congo" is flawless with two exceptions. One: for a suspense movie, there were only a few scenes of pure suspense and mostly action. There needed to be more scenes of suspense (such as the gray gorillas picking off people without anyone else knowing or more scenes of pure quiet that could've suddenly exploded with a scare). Also, the origin story of the gray gorillas was merely brushed over and not explained in full. There needed to be a fully-detailed explanation of the gray's origins, such as clues throughout the city that would lead up to the discovery of their origins or an autopsy scene to determine what kind of ape they really were. Besides those two flaws, the rest of "Congo" is pure Crichton, pure adventure, and pure fun. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves Crichton and good-old-fashioned jungle adventure stories.

    The worst Michael Crichton adaptation ever; this makes the abysmal SPHERE seem like JURASSIC PARK. We begin with a failed expedition to find... something mysterious in Africa. A corporation sends Laura Linney to discover where the missing team went. She's joined by an ape researcher and his, through a technical back strap, talking gorilla Amy. Tim Curry as a Romanian capitalist with greed pouring through his veins joins the group. And Ernie Hudson tries his best as the adventurous guide as they go from one limp peril to the next: from a plane ride tailed by heat seeking missiles to a nighttime hippo attack resembling Disneyland's Jungle Cruise  and not even that exciting. The plodding trek leads to a city built around a diamond mine, protected by killer albino gorillas who not only seem like men leaping around in gorilla suits, but are men leaping around in gorilla suits. Yet Amy actually looks realistic, but her forced sentimentality to manipulate audience adoration makes one yearn to throw a banana-grenade in her path, and hopefully her annoyingly idealistic trainer, played by a dull Dylan Walsh, is beside her. Director Frank Marshall was on a roll after ALIVE and ARACHNOPHOBIA, but he overshot here and failed miserably. For More Reviews: cultfilmfreak.com

    I've read the book by Michael Crichton once and I actually found it a little graphic in it's violence, but that's what makes it so enjoyable to read. So, when I heard that Frank Marshall, the producer who worked with Steven Spielberg in the Indiana Jones films, directed this adaptation of the book, I thought it was a very cool idea and would catch my very interest, but going through with all the hatred it had, this film didn't hold up for me, but despite going over the Nostalgia Critic review of this film, however, I thought that this is an OK film. Not good, not bad. Just sort of "There. A test of formal mediocrity." I'm surprised that Roger Ebert himself liked this film, but as for me, I'm calling this a guilty pleasure. There are a few good things that prevented me for giving this movie a much lower rating. The cinematography is surprisingly superb, the scenery is very nice to look at, and Jerry Goldsmith's music score was very riveting. The strongest aspect goes to the cast. Laura Linney did a good job as the strong lead. Dylan Walsh, although not his best performance, gives a good delivery. Tim Curry, however, was OK. His accent didn't interest me, but hey it's acting. What do you expect? In fact, I really liked him here despite the hammy material he's been given. So, please, critics. Stop criticizing the actor. I felt that Joe Don Baker was so annoying because he does nothing other than overreacting and shouting. The best actors in this movie so far goes to Bruce Campbell for his clever personality and Ernie Hudson for his flawless charm and grin. That's it for my praise. So, what do I hate about this movie? Well, there are four problems that didn't leave an impact. First, the Dialogue is easily mediocre. It had some crude material, but at least it had some funny moments ("Stop eating my sesame cake"). Second, the plot deviates itself from the book although it had a great atmosphere in some of the scenes. Third, the directing from Frank Marshall was very inconsistent. And fourth, but not the least, is the movie's cheesy special effects and I didn't get why the monkeys jump into the lava near the end of the film which was the most cheesiest moment. Even the scene in the King Solomons Mine scene was very graphic. I mean, getting your head bashed felt pretty real. Shocking, isn't it? Overall, Congo isn't as horrible as the critics generally said it was, but with a better plot and better special effects, it would have been an astounding film other than a mediocre adaptation of the book written by the same guy who wrote Jurassic Park. Rating: 5.5/10

Despite the poor script, there are some good characters here who really make you want to like the film more. Curry as always is the one with a secret, Linney plays the straight woman, but most of all, it's Hudson here who really steals the show. With his tongue firmly in cheek, he spouts his lines with cheesy glee stealing the thunder from anyone else. Effects are not the best, but i think it adds to the films silly charm. Not to be taken seriously, just a big silly movie.

    Congo is a modern day Indiana Jones, or more specifically, a modern day King Solomon's Mines. It's a great movie with everything you would expect to be in an adventure movie: monsters, lost cities, a war in the background, and a group of daring adventurers. What sets this movie apart are the personalities of the adventurers. The party is made up of four groups. There is the communications corporation which is sending a team deep into the Congo to find out what happened to a previous team. The corporation wants some flawless diamonds for its laser and will do anything to get it. There are the scientists that are going into the Congo to return an ape to her natural environment, there is the archaeologist that is searching for the lost city, and then there are the mercenaries. The groups are interesting for the scientists are very open with what they want. Their ape, Amy, wants to return to the jungle so they are taking her. The mercenaries are being paid so they are happy. The secrets come in with the communications corporation and the archaeologist. They both refuse to reveal the true reason for their journey, and the truth has to be drawn out from them, which the mercenary leader manages to do. The original story is by Michael Crichton, so one can expect a little social comment in it. Once again the comment is about man playing God. The ancient city genetically created a breed of killer apes to guard the diamond mines. The apes were so vicious and uncontrollable they turn on their masters and killed them. Now nobody can go to the city because the apes will kill them. The subtle point is that the scientists are teaching the ape, Amy, to talk. What we see in the movie is the beginning of the experiment, and the end result. The ancients did what the scientists are trying to do and ended up creating a monster that they could not destroy. Congo seems to also reveal the true power of nature. Though there are lots of threats from humanity, such as the war in Zaire and the apes, they are also threatened by nature. The volcano that the city is built on is rumbling and ready to explode. This is the more obvious note. We also are confronted with other creatures, such as the Hippo and the Silverback Gorilla. The hippopotamus (greek for River Horse) may seem like a placid creature, but in the wild they are brutes. When I first saw the movie I thought that they were crocodiles until I realised that they were really hippos. Then there is the Silverback. When they are confronted with it, one suddenly realises that that creature could rip a full-grown man apart. Not something to trifle with. Congo is a great little adventure movie with everything one would expect in such a movie. The action keeps on coming and the characters are all interesting. The best thing is, they didn't kill of my favourite character in the end. But then again, you would expect him to know a little bit about staying alive.

    After the mega-success of Spielberg's Jurassic Park in 1993, I imagine that producers were all over author Michael Crichton's back catalogue in search of another potential box-office hit; featuring untamed wilderness, a cute talking gorilla, some far less appealing killer apes, a laser weapon, King Solomon's lost diamond mines, and an exploding volcano, exotic, jungle-based adventure Congo was a natural choice for the block-buster approach. Directed by Frank Marshall, the film made a healthy profit, but the critics tore the film apart, clearly of the opinion that this heady concoction of action, horror, industrial intrigue, drama and warfare was no match for Mel Gibson in a kilt or a talking pig. But then what do critics know anyway? This might not be a superlative piece of cinemaJohn Patrick Shanley's screenplay conveys no meaningful message, Frank Marshall never advances the art of film-making with his direction, and one needn't bother looking for any Oscar-worthy performancesbut Congo still proves to be hugely entertaining nonsense, a whole lot of cheesy, big budget fun, with cool creature effects (the gorilla suits were by FX legend Stan Winston), impressive set design, some decent action set-pieces, a wonderfully camp performance from Tim Curry as Romanian treasure seeker Herkermer Homolka, a neat cameo from Bruce Campbell, lovely Laura Linney and her delightful dimples, and some truly manky monkeys (OK, so technically they're apes, but for the purpose of alliteration, they're monkeys!). And that's got 'entertaining' stamped all over it as far as I am concerned.

    Here is my personal review of the 1995 science-fiction/adventure film "Congo," directed by Frank Marshall and produced by Kathleen Kennedy, based on the novel by "Jurassic Park" author Michael Crichton. To start this off, I'll lay down the basic plot of the movie: TraviCom is a major electronics/telecommunications company based in Houston, Texas that sends an expedition to the Congo rain forest in Africa. The expedition's goal is to search for a deposit of extremely valuable, rare diamonds that, in the hands of TraviCom, will change the telecommunications industry overnight. However, SOMETHING slaughters the entire expedition party, and that includes the son of the company CEO that TraviCom employee Karen Ross loves. At the insistence of her boss, Karen Ross links up with Peter Elliot, a California primatetologist and his female gorilla, Amy (whom Peter has taught to paint and speak sign language with the help of an electronic glove). Once the new expedition reaches Africa, they bring on board Monroe Kelly, a "great white hunter who happens to be black" and a Romanian philanthropist named Herkemer Homolka. The expedition faces its fare share of obstacles before finally reaching its destination; the fabled lost city of Zinj, home to the same rare diamonds that the first TraviCom expedition was looking for. Unfortunately for the protagonists, the city of Zinj is home to something deadly: genetically mutated carnivorous gray gorillas, created and trained by the ancient people of Zinj to guard the valuable diamonds. Once the gray gorillas make themselves known, the explorers learn that in the African Congo, YOU ARE THE ENDANGERED SPECIES!

A corporation sends Laura Linney to discover where the missing team went. She's joined by an ape researcher and his, through a technical back strap, talking gorilla Amy. Tim Curry as a Romanian capitalist with greed pouring through his veins joins the group. And Ernie Hudson tries his best as the adventurous guide as they go from one limp peril to the next: from a plane ride tailed by heat seeking missiles to a nighttime hippo attack resembling Disneyland's Jungle Cruise  and not even that exciting. The plodding trek leads to a city built around a diamond mine, protected by killer albino gorillas who not only seem like men leaping around in gorilla suits, but are men leaping around in gorilla suits. Yet Amy actually looks realistic, but her forced sentimentality to manipulate audience adoration makes one yearn to throw a banana-grenade in her path, and hopefully her annoyingly idealistic trainer, played by a dull Dylan Walsh, is beside her. Director Frank Marshall was on a roll after ALIVE and ARACHNOPHOBIA, but he overshot here and failed miserably. For More Reviews: cultfilmfreak.com

    I've read the book by Michael Crichton once and I actually found it a little graphic in it's violence, but that's what makes it so enjoyable to read. So, when I heard that Frank Marshall, the producer who worked with Steven Spielberg in the Indiana Jones films, directed this adaptation of the book, I thought it was a very cool idea and would catch my very interest, but going through with all the hatred it had, this film didn't hold up for me, but despite going over the Nostalgia Critic review of this film, however, I thought that this is an OK film. Not good, not bad. Just sort of "There. A test of formal mediocrity." I'm surprised that Roger Ebert himself liked this film, but as for me, I'm calling this a guilty pleasure. There are a few good things that prevented me for giving this movie a much lower rating. The cinematography is surprisingly superb, the scenery is very nice to look at, and Jerry Goldsmith's music score was very riveting. The strongest aspect goes to the cast. Laura Linney did a good job as the strong lead. Dylan Walsh, although not his best performance, gives a good delivery. Tim Curry, however, was OK. His accent didn't interest me, but hey it's acting. What do you expect? In fact, I really liked him here despite the hammy material he's been given. So, please, critics. Stop criticizing the actor. I felt that Joe Don Baker was so annoying because he does nothing other than overreacting and shouting. The best actors in this movie so far goes to Bruce Campbell for his clever personality and Ernie Hudson for his flawless charm and grin. That's it for my praise. So, what do I hate about this movie? Well, there are four problems that didn't leave an impact. First, the Dialogue is easily mediocre. It had some crude material, but at least it had some funny moments ("Stop eating my sesame cake"). Second, the plot deviates itself from the book although it had a great atmosphere in some of the scenes. Third, the directing from Frank Marshall was very inconsistent. And fourth, but not the least, is the movie's cheesy special effects and I didn't get why the monkeys jump into the lava near the end of the film which was the most cheesiest moment. Even the scene in the King Solomons Mine scene was very graphic. I mean, getting your head bashed felt pretty real. Shocking, isn't it? Overall, Congo isn't as horrible as the critics generally said it was, but with a better plot and better special effects, it would have been an astounding film other than a mediocre adaptation of the book written by the same guy who wrote Jurassic Park. Rating: 5.5/10

    A megalomaniac C.E.O. sends his son into the dangerous African Congo on a quest for a source of diamonds large enough and pure enough to function as powerful laser communications transmitters. When contact is lost with his son and the team, his sometime daughter- in-law is sent after them. She is a former CIA operative and, accompanied by gee-whiz gadgetry and a few eccentric characters and sets out to rescue her former fianc&eacute;. What they all discover is that often what we most want turns out to be the source of our downfall. yes, the film was basically selling itself as the new Jurassic Park, and while it's nowhere near as good as that behemoth, it still has it's moments. Despite the poor script, there are some good characters here who really make you want to like the film more. Curry as always is the one with a secret, Linney plays the straight woman, but most of all, it's Hudson here who really steals the show. With his tongue firmly in cheek, he spouts his lines with cheesy glee stealing the thunder from anyone else. Effects are not the best, but i think it adds to the films silly charm. Not to be taken seriously, just a big silly movie.

    Congo is a modern day Indiana Jones, or more specifically, a modern day King Solomon's Mines. It's a great movie with everything you would expect to be in an adventure movie: monsters, lost cities, a war in the background, and a group of daring adventurers. What sets this movie apart are the personalities of the adventurers. The party is made up of four groups. There is the communications corporation which is sending a team deep into the Congo to find out what happened to a previous team. The corporation wants some flawless diamonds for its laser and will do anything to get it. There are the scientists that are going into the Congo to return an ape to her natural environment, there is the archaeologist that is searching for the lost city, and then there are the mercenaries. The groups are interesting for the scientists are very open with what they want. Their ape, Amy, wants to return to the jungle so they are taking her. The mercenaries are being paid so they are happy. The secrets come in with the communications corporation and the archaeologist. They both refuse to reveal the true reason for their journey, and the truth has to be drawn out from them, which the mercenary leader manages to do. The original story is by Michael Crichton, so one can expect a little social comment in it. Once again the comment is about man playing God. The ancient city genetically created a breed of killer apes to guard the diamond mines. The apes were so vicious and uncontrollable they turn on their masters and killed them. Now nobody can go to the city because the apes will kill them. The subtle point is that the scientists are teaching the ape, Amy, to talk. What we see in the movie is the beginning of the experiment, and the end result. The ancients did what the scientists are trying to do and ended up creating a monster that they could not destroy. Congo seems to also reveal the true power of nature. Though there are lots of threats from humanity, such as the war in Zaire and the apes, they are also threatened by nature. The volcano that the city is built on is rumbling and ready to explode. This is the more obvious note. We also are confronted with other creatures, such as the Hippo and the Silverback Gorilla. The hippopotamus (greek for River Horse) may seem like a placid creature, but in the wild they are brutes. When I first saw the movie I thought that they were crocodiles until I realised that they were really hippos. Then there is the Silverback. When they are confronted with it, one suddenly realises that that creature could rip a full-grown man apart. Not something to trifle with. Congo is a great little adventure movie with everything one would expect in such a movie. The action keeps on coming and the characters are all interesting. The best thing is, they didn't kill of my favourite character in the end. But then again, you would expect him to know a little bit about staying alive.

    After the mega-success of Spielberg's Jurassic Park in 1993, I imagine that producers were all over author Michael Crichton's back catalogue in search of another potential box-office hit; featuring untamed wilderness, a cute talking gorilla, some far less appealing killer apes, a laser weapon, King Solomon's lost diamond mines, and an exploding volcano, exotic, jungle-based adventure Congo was a natural choice for the block-buster approach. Directed by Frank Marshall, the film made a healthy profit, but the critics tore the film apart, clearly of the opinion that this heady concoction of action, horror, industrial intrigue, drama and warfare was no match for Mel Gibson in a kilt or a talking pig. But then what do critics know anyway? This might not be a superlative piece of cinemaJohn Patrick Shanley's screenplay conveys no meaningful message, Frank Marshall never advances the art of film-making with his direction, and one needn't bother looking for any Oscar-worthy performancesbut Congo still proves to be hugely entertaining nonsense, a whole lot of cheesy, big budget fun, with cool creature effects (the gorilla suits were by FX legend Stan Winston), impressive set design, some decent action set-pieces, a wonderfully camp performance from Tim Curry as Romanian treasure seeker Herkermer Homolka, a neat cameo from Bruce Campbell, lovely Laura Linney and her delightful dimples, and some truly manky monkeys (OK, so technically they're apes, but for the purpose of alliteration, they're monkeys!). And that's got 'entertaining' stamped all over it as far as I am concerned.

    Based on Michael Crichton's novel, film is about a research/rescue team sent into the African Congo, and led by Dr. Karen Ross(Laura Linney) that includes Dr. Peter Elliot(Dylan Walsh) who has with him a talking gorilla(due to a new technology in her larynx). Tim Curry and Ernie Hudson play devious characters who are also along for the mission. They are sent to locate the first research team that had apparently located some large and pure diamonds that are worth a fortune to the company funding the expeditions. Complicating matters are the instability of the local government, and a rumored mythical race of apes said to live deep in the jungle. As it turns out, they are no myth... Lightweight adventure yarn is watchable to a point, but too silly and outlandish to succeed, though it remains innocuous.

    It's not clear whether this bone-brained B-movie adventure is a spoof, an homage or a straight-faced misfire, but it's not much fun whichever way you look at it. Based on Michael Crichton's so-so novel, it's a nutty mixture of lost cities, giant hippos, monster monkeys, unconvincing visual effects and corny dialogue. The first sign that the movie isn't going to work is the gorilla that communicates in sign language, and needless to say the film doesn't get any better from that point on. Making all this old rope somewhat worthwhile are Tim Curry, feverishly hamming it up with a bizarre accent that defies identification, and Ernie Hudson, who also seems aware that this is all a load of old rubbish.

    The movie Congo is hushedly giantly appealing; Congo's viewing is very attractive for some reasons. Congo has these beautiful landscapes with great 'geothermal' colors, first-class budgeted production effects, and an awesomely themed story about killer gorillas, silver, killer gorillas at that. People are profoundly interested in the great apes, curious to know their ways, how smart that they are, and if they're dangerous or not. Congo interests in that. Also, Congo's a gentle, unmalicious viewing which so helps in strengthening its gorier moments, and it's backed by a drastically popular novel, oh, and it has lava! All this, and what else, makes it very largely appealing. Ooo! Ooo! I know what else! The beautiful Laura Linney! I can't forget about her! She's, really like, perfect, for the part. This is Linney's great starring role in Congo. I think she knocked it out of the park. Laura is more infatuating in a leading role than she is in her supporting roles even. Once the team gets to the Congo, Congo starts getting better. If you're expecting some Hollywood blockbuster typical-type movie, you're not gonna get it here. Is it just me, or do gorilla suits look exactly like real gorillas?

    It doesn't deserve any special attention, obviously not for any redeeming qualities but nor is it particularly bad either. Don't take me wrong, it does miss the mark almost entirely, although the budget can be clearly seen throughout from the star-studded cast to the various and elaborate set designs. The special effects are OK too; what this movie lacks is any kind of imagination or shred of originality to lift it up from it's generic trappings that most mediocre movies fall victim to. A movie about killer apes, it's gotta be at least kind of cool, right? There is maybe about fifteen minutes of screen time that even involves said killer apes, let alone shows them, and it is (of course) wedged somewhere in to the latter portion of the third act. There is a friendly gorilla who is a consistent character throughout the movie. Amy, the "talking gorilla", is about the only thing (besides Tim Curry) that won me over, but after about the first hour, it actually begins to feel like a movie about people with a gorilla character, not a movie about gorillas. You know the kind of bad movie in which after a long while, you notice it's just been different scenes of the characters talking to each other the whole time, well after it should have started to deliver? Yeah, if you've seen a lot of movies, you know what I mean. Congo could have easily had about twenty minutes shaved off, being stuffed full of useless and distracting development. My review (if accepted, after I write this) will likely be wedged somewhere in the back, never to be read by anyone else who grew up with the name Congo in the back of their mind and are curious about that 90s blockbuster about killer apes, and will be put behind the apparently favored "it's fun to watch" reviews, but let at least one person tell you; it's silly, it's convoluted and pointless, it's disappointing. It just kind of insults your intelligence and for the time period that it came out, it could have been at least a little better.

    Here is my personal review of the 1995 science-fiction/adventure film "Congo," directed by Frank Marshall and produced by Kathleen Kennedy, based on the novel by "Jurassic Park" author Michael Crichton. To start this off, I'll lay down the basic plot of the movie: TraviCom is a major electronics/telecommunications company based in Houston, Texas that sends an expedition to the Congo rain forest in Africa. The expedition's goal is to search for a deposit of extremely valuable, rare diamonds that, in the hands of TraviCom, will change the telecommunications industry overnight. However, SOMETHING slaughters the entire expedition party, and that includes the son of the company CEO that TraviCom employee Karen Ross loves. At the insistence of her boss, Karen Ross links up with Peter Elliot, a California primatetologist and his female gorilla, Amy (whom Peter has taught to paint and speak sign language with the help of an electronic glove). Once the new expedition reaches Africa, they bring on board Monroe Kelly, a "great white hunter who happens to be black" and a Romanian philanthropist named Herkemer Homolka. The expedition faces its fare share of obstacles before finally reaching its destination; the fabled lost city of Zinj, home to the same rare diamonds that the first TraviCom expedition was looking for. Unfortunately for the protagonists, the city of Zinj is home to something deadly: genetically mutated carnivorous gray gorillas, created and trained by the ancient people of Zinj to guard the valuable diamonds. Once the gray gorillas make themselves known, the explorers learn that in the African Congo, YOU ARE THE ENDANGERED SPECIES! If you love Michael Crichton or any movie that takes place in the jungle, this is the movie for you! The story is a well-translated yet slightly different telling of Crichton's story. The characters are well-defined and the acting is on a scale of 1 to 10, a 7. The late special-effects wizard Stan Winston uses amazing, realistic costumes with animatronic masks to breathe life into the signing gorilla Amy and the terrifying gray gorillas. Amy herself is a great character brought to life by both Stan Winston's robotic ape mask and the suit performer who brought out Amy's signing skills out really well. All in all, I love this movie, and everyone who gave it a negative review needs to find a better line of work! Most of "Congo" is flawless with two exceptions. One: for a suspense movie, there were only a few scenes of pure suspense and mostly action. There needed to be more scenes of suspense (such as the gray gorillas picking off people without anyone else knowing or more scenes of pure quiet that could've suddenly exploded with a scare). Also, the origin story of the gray gorillas was merely brushed over and not explained in full. There needed to be a fully-detailed explanation of the gray's origins, such as clues throughout the city that would lead up to the discovery of their origins or an autopsy scene to determine what kind of ape they really were. Besides those two flaws, the rest of "Congo" is pure Crichton, pure adventure, and pure fun. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves Crichton and good-old-fashioned jungle adventure stories.

The first sign that the movie isn't going to work is the gorilla that communicates in sign language, and needless to say the film doesn't get any better from that point on. Making all this old rope somewhat worthwhile are Tim Curry, feverishly hamming it up with a bizarre accent that defies identification, and Ernie Hudson, who also seems aware that this is all a load of old rubbish.

    The movie Congo is hushedly giantly appealing; Congo's viewing is very attractive for some reasons. Congo has these beautiful landscapes with great 'geothermal' colors, first-class budgeted production effects, and an awesomely themed story about killer gorillas, silver, killer gorillas at that. People are profoundly interested in the great apes, curious to know their ways, how smart that they are, and if they're dangerous or not. Congo interests in that. Also, Congo's a gentle, unmalicious viewing which so helps in strengthening its gorier moments, and it's backed by a drastically popular novel, oh, and it has lava! All this, and what else, makes it very largely appealing. Ooo! Ooo! I know what else! The beautiful Laura Linney! I can't forget about her! She's, really like, perfect, for the part. This is Linney's great starring role in Congo. I think she knocked it out of the park. Laura is more infatuating in a leading role than she is in her supporting roles even. Once the team gets to the Congo, Congo starts getting better. If you're expecting some Hollywood blockbuster typical-type movie, you're not gonna get it here. Is it just me, or do gorilla suits look exactly like real gorillas?

    It doesn't deserve any special attention, obviously not for any redeeming qualities but nor is it particularly bad either. Don't take me wrong, it does miss the mark almost entirely, although the budget can be clearly seen throughout from the star-studded cast to the various and elaborate set designs. The special effects are OK too; what this movie lacks is any kind of imagination or shred of originality to lift it up from it's generic trappings that most mediocre movies fall victim to. A movie about killer apes, it's gotta be at least kind of cool, right? There is maybe about fifteen minutes of screen time that even involves said killer apes, let alone shows them, and it is (of course) wedged somewhere in to the latter portion of the third act. There is a friendly gorilla who is a consistent character throughout the movie. Amy, the "talking gorilla", is about the only thing (besides Tim Curry) that won me over, but after about the first hour, it actually begins to feel like a movie about people with a gorilla character, not a movie about gorillas. You know the kind of bad movie in which after a long while, you notice it's just been different scenes of the characters talking to each other the whole time, well after it should have started to deliver? Yeah, if you've seen a lot of movies, you know what I mean. Congo could have easily had about twenty minutes shaved off, being stuffed full of useless and distracting development. My review (if accepted, after I write this) will likely be wedged somewhere in the back, never to be read by anyone else who grew up with the name Congo in the back of their mind and are curious about that 90s blockbuster about killer apes, and will be put behind the apparently favored "it's fun to watch" reviews, but let at least one person tell you; it's silly, it's convoluted and pointless, it's disappointing. It just kind of insults your intelligence and for the time period that it came out, it could have been at least a little better.

    Here is my personal review of the 1995 science-fiction/adventure film "Congo," directed by Frank Marshall and produced by Kathleen Kennedy, based on the novel by "Jurassic Park" author Michael Crichton. To start this off, I'll lay down the basic plot of the movie: TraviCom is a major electronics/telecommunications company based in Houston, Texas that sends an expedition to the Congo rain forest in Africa. The expedition's goal is to search for a deposit of extremely valuable, rare diamonds that, in the hands of TraviCom, will change the telecommunications industry overnight. However, SOMETHING slaughters the entire expedition party, and that includes the son of the company CEO that TraviCom employee Karen Ross loves. At the insistence of her boss, Karen Ross links up with Peter Elliot, a California primatetologist and his female gorilla, Amy (whom Peter has taught to paint and speak sign language with the help of an electronic glove). Once the new expedition reaches Africa, they bring on board Monroe Kelly, a "great white hunter who happens to be black" and a Romanian philanthropist named Herkemer Homolka. The expedition faces its fare share of obstacles before finally reaching its destination; the fabled lost city of Zinj, home to the same rare diamonds that the first TraviCom expedition was looking for. Unfortunately for the protagonists, the city of Zinj is home to something deadly: genetically mutated carnivorous gray gorillas, created and trained by the ancient people of Zinj to guard the valuable diamonds. Once the gray gorillas make themselves known, the explorers learn that in the African Congo, YOU ARE THE ENDANGERED SPECIES! If you love Michael Crichton or any movie that takes place in the jungle, this is the movie for you! The story is a well-translated yet slightly different telling of Crichton's story. The characters are well-defined and the acting is on a scale of 1 to 10, a 7. The late special-effects wizard Stan Winston uses amazing, realistic costumes with animatronic masks to breathe life into the signing gorilla Amy and the terrifying gray gorillas. Amy herself is a great character brought to life by both Stan Winston's robotic ape mask and the suit performer who brought out Amy's signing skills out really well. All in all, I love this movie, and everyone who gave it a negative review needs to find a better line of work! Most of "Congo" is flawless with two exceptions. One: for a suspense movie, there were only a few scenes of pure suspense and mostly action. There needed to be more scenes of suspense (such as the gray gorillas picking off people without anyone else knowing or more scenes of pure quiet that could've suddenly exploded with a scare). Also, the origin story of the gray gorillas was merely brushed over and not explained in full. There needed to be a fully-detailed explanation of the gray's origins, such as clues throughout the city that would lead up to the discovery of their origins or an autopsy scene to determine what kind of ape they really were. Besides those two flaws, the rest of "Congo" is pure Crichton, pure adventure, and pure fun. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves Crichton and good-old-fashioned jungle adventure stories.

    The worst Michael Crichton adaptation ever; this makes the abysmal SPHERE seem like JURASSIC PARK. We begin with a failed expedition to find... something mysterious in Africa. A corporation sends Laura Linney to discover where the missing team went. She's joined by an ape researcher and his, through a technical back strap, talking gorilla Amy. Tim Curry as a Romanian capitalist with greed pouring through his veins joins the group. And Ernie Hudson tries his best as the adventurous guide as they go from one limp peril to the next: from a plane ride tailed by heat seeking missiles to a nighttime hippo attack resembling Disneyland's Jungle Cruise  and not even that exciting. The plodding trek leads to a city built around a diamond mine, protected by killer albino gorillas who not only seem like men leaping around in gorilla suits, but are men leaping around in gorilla suits. Yet Amy actually looks realistic, but her forced sentimentality to manipulate audience adoration makes one yearn to throw a banana-grenade in her path, and hopefully her annoyingly idealistic trainer, played by a dull Dylan Walsh, is beside her. Director Frank Marshall was on a roll after ALIVE and ARACHNOPHOBIA, but he overshot here and failed miserably. For More Reviews: cultfilmfreak.com

    I've read the book by Michael Crichton once and I actually found it a little graphic in it's violence, but that's what makes it so enjoyable to read. So, when I heard that Frank Marshall, the producer who worked with Steven Spielberg in the Indiana Jones films, directed this adaptation of the book, I thought it was a very cool idea and would catch my very interest, but going through with all the hatred it had, this film didn't hold up for me, but despite going over the Nostalgia Critic review of this film, however, I thought that this is an OK film. Not good, not bad. Just sort of "There. A test of formal mediocrity." I'm surprised that Roger Ebert himself liked this film, but as for me, I'm calling this a guilty pleasure. There are a few good things that prevented me for giving this movie a much lower rating. The cinematography is surprisingly superb, the scenery is very nice to look at, and Jerry Goldsmith's music score was very riveting. The strongest aspect goes to the cast. Laura Linney did a good job as the strong lead. Dylan Walsh, although not his best performance, gives a good delivery. Tim Curry, however, was OK. His accent didn't interest me, but hey it's acting. What do you expect? In fact, I really liked him here despite the hammy material he's been given. So, please, critics. Stop criticizing the actor. I felt that Joe Don Baker was so annoying because he does nothing other than overreacting and shouting. The best actors in this movie so far goes to Bruce Campbell for his clever personality and Ernie Hudson for his flawless charm and grin. That's it for my praise. So, what do I hate about this movie? Well, there are four problems that didn't leave an impact. First, the Dialogue is easily mediocre. It had some crude material, but at least it had some funny moments ("Stop eating my sesame cake"). Second, the plot deviates itself from the book although it had a great atmosphere in some of the scenes. Third, the directing from Frank Marshall was very inconsistent. And fourth, but not the least, is the movie's cheesy special effects and I didn't get why the monkeys jump into the lava near the end of the film which was the most cheesiest moment. Even the scene in the King Solomons Mine scene was very graphic. I mean, getting your head bashed felt pretty real. Shocking, isn't it? Overall, Congo isn't as horrible as the critics generally said it was, but with a better plot and better special effects, it would have been an astounding film other than a mediocre adaptation of the book written by the same guy who wrote Jurassic Park. Rating: 5.5/10

    A megalomaniac C.E.O. sends his son into the dangerous African Congo on a quest for a source of diamonds large enough and pure enough to function as powerful laser communications transmitters. When contact is lost with his son and the team, his sometime daughter- in-law is sent after them. She is a former CIA operative and, accompanied by gee-whiz gadgetry and a few eccentric characters and sets out to rescue her former fianc&eacute;. What they all discover is that often what we most want turns out to be the source of our downfall. yes, the film was basically selling itself as the new Jurassic Park, and while it's nowhere near as good as that behemoth, it still has it's moments. Despite the poor script, there are some good characters here who really make you want to like the film more. Curry as always is the one with a secret, Linney plays the straight woman, but most of all, it's Hudson here who really steals the show. With his tongue firmly in cheek, he spouts his lines with cheesy glee stealing the thunder from anyone else. Effects are not the best, but i think it adds to the films silly charm. Not to be taken seriously, just a big silly movie.

    Congo is a modern day Indiana Jones, or more specifically, a modern day King Solomon's Mines. It's a great movie with everything you would expect to be in an adventure movie: monsters, lost cities, a war in the background, and a group of daring adventurers. What sets this movie apart are the personalities of the adventurers. The party is made up of four groups. There is the communications corporation which is sending a team deep into the Congo to find out what happened to a previous team. The corporation wants some flawless diamonds for its laser and will do anything to get it. There are the scientists that are going into the Congo to return an ape to her natural environment, there is the archaeologist that is searching for the lost city, and then there are the mercenaries. The groups are interesting for the scientists are very open with what they want. Their ape, Amy, wants to return to the jungle so they are taking her. The mercenaries are being paid so they are happy. The secrets come in with the communications corporation and the archaeologist. They both refuse to reveal the true reason for their journey, and the truth has to be drawn out from them, which the mercenary leader manages to do. The original story is by Michael Crichton, so one can expect a little social comment in it. Once again the comment is about man playing God. The ancient city genetically created a breed of killer apes to guard the diamond mines. The apes were so vicious and uncontrollable they turn on their masters and killed them. Now nobody can go to the city because the apes will kill them. The subtle point is that the scientists are teaching the ape, Amy, to talk. What we see in the movie is the beginning of the experiment, and the end result. The ancients did what the scientists are trying to do and ended up creating a monster that they could not destroy. Congo seems to also reveal the true power of nature. Though there are lots of threats from humanity, such as the war in Zaire and the apes, they are also threatened by nature. The volcano that the city is built on is rumbling and ready to explode. This is the more obvious note. We also are confronted with other creatures, such as the Hippo and the Silverback Gorilla. The hippopotamus (greek for River Horse) may seem like a placid creature, but in the wild they are brutes. When I first saw the movie I thought that they were crocodiles until I realised that they were really hippos. Then there is the Silverback. When they are confronted with it, one suddenly realises that that creature could rip a full-grown man apart. Not something to trifle with. Congo is a great little adventure movie with everything one would expect in such a movie. The action keeps on coming and the characters are all interesting. The best thing is, they didn't kill of my favourite character in the end. But then again, you would expect him to know a little bit about staying alive.

    After the mega-success of Spielberg's Jurassic Park in 1993, I imagine that producers were all over author Michael Crichton's back catalogue in search of another potential box-office hit; featuring untamed wilderness, a cute talking gorilla, some far less appealing killer apes, a laser weapon, King Solomon's lost diamond mines, and an exploding volcano, exotic, jungle-based adventure Congo was a natural choice for the block-buster approach. Directed by Frank Marshall, the film made a healthy profit, but the critics tore the film apart, clearly of the opinion that this heady concoction of action, horror, industrial intrigue, drama and warfare was no match for Mel Gibson in a kilt or a talking pig. But then what do critics know anyway? This might not be a superlative piece of cinemaJohn Patrick Shanley's screenplay conveys no meaningful message, Frank Marshall never advances the art of film-making with his direction, and one needn't bother looking for any Oscar-worthy performancesbut Congo still proves to be hugely entertaining nonsense, a whole lot of cheesy, big budget fun, with cool creature effects (the gorilla suits were by FX legend Stan Winston), impressive set design, some decent action set-pieces, a wonderfully camp performance from Tim Curry as Romanian treasure seeker Herkermer Homolka, a neat cameo from Bruce Campbell, lovely Laura Linney and her delightful dimples, and some truly manky monkeys (OK, so technically they're apes, but for the purpose of alliteration, they're monkeys!). And that's got 'entertaining' stamped all over it as far as I am concerned.

    Based on Michael Crichton's novel, film is about a research/rescue team sent into the African Congo, and led by Dr. Karen Ross(Laura Linney) that includes Dr. Peter Elliot(Dylan Walsh) who has with him a talking gorilla(due to a new technology in her larynx). Tim Curry and Ernie Hudson play devious characters who are also along for the mission. They are sent to locate the first research team that had apparently located some large and pure diamonds that are worth a fortune to the company funding the expeditions. Complicating matters are the instability of the local government, and a rumored mythical race of apes said to live deep in the jungle. As it turns out, they are no myth... Lightweight adventure yarn is watchable to a point, but too silly and outlandish to succeed, though it remains innocuous.

    A megalomaniac C.E.O. sends his son into the dangerous African Congo on a quest for a source of diamonds large enough and pure enough to function as powerful laser communications transmitters. When contact is lost with his son and the team, his sometime daughter- in-law is sent after them. She is a former CIA operative and, accompanied by gee-whiz gadgetry and a few eccentric characters and sets out to rescue her former fianc&eacute;. What they all discover is that often what we most want turns out to be the source of our downfall. yes, the film was basically selling itself as the new Jurassic Park, and while it's nowhere near as good as that behemoth, it still has it's moments. Despite the poor script, there are some good characters here who really make you want to like the film more. Curry as always is the one with a secret, Linney plays the straight woman, but most of all, it's Hudson here who really steals the show. With his tongue firmly in cheek, he spouts his lines with cheesy glee stealing the thunder from anyone else. Effects are not the best, but i think it adds to the films silly charm. Not to be taken seriously, just a big silly movie.

    Congo is a modern day Indiana Jones, or more specifically, a modern day King Solomon's Mines. It's a great movie with everything you would expect to be in an adventure movie: monsters, lost cities, a war in the background, and a group of daring adventurers. What sets this movie apart are the personalities of the adventurers. The party is made up of four groups. There is the communications corporation which is sending a team deep into the Congo to find out what happened to a previous team. The corporation wants some flawless diamonds for its laser and will do anything to get it. There are the scientists that are going into the Congo to return an ape to her natural environment, there is the archaeologist that is searching for the lost city, and then there are the mercenaries. The groups are interesting for the scientists are very open with what they want. Their ape, Amy, wants to return to the jungle so they are taking her. The mercenaries are being paid so they are happy. The secrets come in with the communications corporation and the archaeologist. They both refuse to reveal the true reason for their journey, and the truth has to be drawn out from them, which the mercenary leader manages to do. The original story is by Michael Crichton, so one can expect a little social comment in it. Once again the comment is about man playing God. The ancient city genetically created a breed of killer apes to guard the diamond mines. The apes were so vicious and uncontrollable they turn on their masters and killed them. Now nobody can go to the city because the apes will kill them. The subtle point is that the scientists are teaching the ape, Amy, to talk. What we see in the movie is the beginning of the experiment, and the end result. The ancients did what the scientists are trying to do and ended up creating a monster that they could not destroy. Congo seems to also reveal the true power of nature. Though there are lots of threats from humanity, such as the war in Zaire and the apes, they are also threatened by nature. The volcano that the city is built on is rumbling and ready to explode. This is the more obvious note. We also are confronted with other creatures, such as the Hippo and the Silverback Gorilla. The hippopotamus (greek for River Horse) may seem like a placid creature, but in the wild they are brutes. When I first saw the movie I thought that they were crocodiles until I realised that they were really hippos. Then there is the Silverback. When they are confronted with it, one suddenly realises that that creature could rip a full-grown man apart. Not something to trifle with. Congo is a great little adventure movie with everything one would expect in such a movie. The action keeps on coming and the characters are all interesting. The best thing is, they didn't kill of my favourite character in the end. But then again, you would expect him to know a little bit about staying alive.

    After the mega-success of Spielberg's Jurassic Park in 1993, I imagine that producers were all over author Michael Crichton's back catalogue in search of another potential box-office hit; featuring untamed wilderness, a cute talking gorilla, some far less appealing killer apes, a laser weapon, King Solomon's lost diamond mines, and an exploding volcano, exotic, jungle-based adventure Congo was a natural choice for the block-buster approach. Directed by Frank Marshall, the film made a healthy profit, but the critics tore the film apart, clearly of the opinion that this heady concoction of action, horror, industrial intrigue, drama and warfare was no match for Mel Gibson in a kilt or a talking pig. But then what do critics know anyway? This might not be a superlative piece of cinemaJohn Patrick Shanley's screenplay conveys no meaningful message, Frank Marshall never advances the art of film-making with his direction, and one needn't bother looking for any Oscar-worthy performancesbut Congo still proves to be hugely entertaining nonsense, a whole lot of cheesy, big budget fun, with cool creature effects (the gorilla suits were by FX legend Stan Winston), impressive set design, some decent action set-pieces, a wonderfully camp performance from Tim Curry as Romanian treasure seeker Herkermer Homolka, a neat cameo from Bruce Campbell, lovely Laura Linney and her delightful dimples, and some truly manky monkeys (OK, so technically they're apes, but for the purpose of alliteration, they're monkeys!). And that's got 'entertaining' stamped all over it as far as I am concerned.

    Based on Michael Crichton's novel, film is about a research/rescue team sent into the African Congo, and led by Dr. Karen Ross(Laura Linney) that includes Dr. Peter Elliot(Dylan Walsh) who has with him a talking gorilla(due to a new technology in her larynx). Tim Curry and Ernie Hudson play devious characters who are also along for the mission. They are sent to locate the first research team that had apparently located some large and pure diamonds that are worth a fortune to the company funding the expeditions. Complicating matters are the instability of the local government, and a rumored mythical race of apes said to live deep in the jungle. As it turns out, they are no myth... Lightweight adventure yarn is watchable to a point, but too silly and outlandish to succeed, though it remains innocuous.

    It's not clear whether this bone-brained B-movie adventure is a spoof, an homage or a straight-faced misfire, but it's not much fun whichever way you look at it. Based on Michael Crichton's so-so novel, it's a nutty mixture of lost cities, giant hippos, monster monkeys, unconvincing visual effects and corny dialogue. The first sign that the movie isn't going to work is the gorilla that communicates in sign language, and needless to say the film doesn't get any better from that point on. Making all this old rope somewhat worthwhile are Tim Curry, feverishly hamming it up with a bizarre accent that defies identification, and Ernie Hudson, who also seems aware that this is all a load of old rubbish.

    The movie Congo is hushedly giantly appealing; Congo's viewing is very attractive for some reasons. Congo has these beautiful landscapes with great 'geothermal' colors, first-class budgeted production effects, and an awesomely themed story about killer gorillas, silver, killer gorillas at that. People are profoundly interested in the great apes, curious to know their ways, how smart that they are, and if they're dangerous or not. Congo interests in that. Also, Congo's a gentle, unmalicious viewing which so helps in strengthening its gorier moments, and it's backed by a drastically popular novel, oh, and it has lava! All this, and what else, makes it very largely appealing. Ooo! Ooo! I know what else! The beautiful Laura Linney! I can't forget about her! She's, really like, perfect, for the part. This is Linney's great starring role in Congo. I think she knocked it out of the park. Laura is more infatuating in a leading role than she is in her supporting roles even. Once the team gets to the Congo, Congo starts getting better. If you're expecting some Hollywood blockbuster typical-type movie, you're not gonna get it here. Is it just me, or do gorilla suits look exactly like real gorillas?

    It doesn't deserve any special attention, obviously not for any redeeming qualities but nor is it particularly bad either. Don't take me wrong, it does miss the mark almost entirely, although the budget can be clearly seen throughout from the star-studded cast to the various and elaborate set designs. The special effects are OK too; what this movie lacks is any kind of imagination or shred of originality to lift it up from it's generic trappings that most mediocre movies fall victim to. A movie about killer apes, it's gotta be at least kind of cool, right? There is maybe about fifteen minutes of screen time that even involves said killer apes, let alone shows them, and it is (of course) wedged somewhere in to the latter portion of the third act. There is a friendly gorilla who is a consistent character throughout the movie. Amy, the "talking gorilla", is about the only thing (besides Tim Curry) that won me over, but after about the first hour, it actually begins to feel like a movie about people with a gorilla character, not a movie about gorillas. You know the kind of bad movie in which after a long while, you notice it's just been different scenes of the characters talking to each other the whole time, well after it should have started to deliver? Yeah, if you've seen a lot of movies, you know what I mean. Congo could have easily had about twenty minutes shaved off, being stuffed full of useless and distracting development. My review (if accepted, after I write this) will likely be wedged somewhere in the back, never to be read by anyone else who grew up with the name Congo in the back of their mind and are curious about that 90s blockbuster about killer apes, and will be put behind the apparently favored "it's fun to watch" reviews, but let at least one person tell you; it's silly, it's convoluted and pointless, it's disappointing. It just kind of insults your intelligence and for the time period that it came out, it could have been at least a little better.

    Here is my personal review of the 1995 science-fiction/adventure film "Congo," directed by Frank Marshall and produced by Kathleen Kennedy, based on the novel by "Jurassic Park" author Michael Crichton. To start this off, I'll lay down the basic plot of the movie: TraviCom is a major electronics/telecommunications company based in Houston, Texas that sends an expedition to the Congo rain forest in Africa. The expedition's goal is to search for a deposit of extremely valuable, rare diamonds that, in the hands of TraviCom, will change the telecommunications industry overnight. However, SOMETHING slaughters the entire expedition party, and that includes the son of the company CEO that TraviCom employee Karen Ross loves. At the insistence of her boss, Karen Ross links up with Peter Elliot, a California primatetologist and his female gorilla, Amy (whom Peter has taught to paint and speak sign language with the help of an electronic glove). Once the new expedition reaches Africa, they bring on board Monroe Kelly, a "great white hunter who happens to be black" and a Romanian philanthropist named Herkemer Homolka. The expedition faces its fare share of obstacles before finally reaching its destination; the fabled lost city of Zinj, home to the same rare diamonds that the first TraviCom expedition was looking for. Unfortunately for the protagonists, the city of Zinj is home to something deadly: genetically mutated carnivorous gray gorillas, created and trained by the ancient people of Zinj to guard the valuable diamonds. Once the gray gorillas make themselves known, the explorers learn that in the African Congo, YOU ARE THE ENDANGERED SPECIES! If you love Michael Crichton or any movie that takes place in the jungle, this is the movie for you! The story is a well-translated yet slightly different telling of Crichton's story. The characters are well-defined and the acting is on a scale of 1 to 10, a 7. The late special-effects wizard Stan Winston uses amazing, realistic costumes with animatronic masks to breathe life into the signing gorilla Amy and the terrifying gray gorillas. Amy herself is a great character brought to life by both Stan Winston's robotic ape mask and the suit performer who brought out Amy's signing skills out really well. All in all, I love this movie, and everyone who gave it a negative review needs to find a better line of work! Most of "Congo" is flawless with two exceptions. One: for a suspense movie, there were only a few scenes of pure suspense and mostly action. There needed to be more scenes of suspense (such as the gray gorillas picking off people without anyone else knowing or more scenes of pure quiet that could've suddenly exploded with a scare). Also, the origin story of the gray gorillas was merely brushed over and not explained in full. There needed to be a fully-detailed explanation of the gray's origins, such as clues throughout the city that would lead up to the discovery of their origins or an autopsy scene to determine what kind of ape they really were. Besides those two flaws, the rest of "Congo" is pure Crichton, pure adventure, and pure fun. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves Crichton and good-old-fashioned jungle adventure stories.

    The worst Michael Crichton adaptation ever; this makes the abysmal SPHERE seem like JURASSIC PARK. We begin with a failed expedition to find... something mysterious in Africa. A corporation sends Laura Linney to discover where the missing team went. She's joined by an ape researcher and his, through a technical back strap, talking gorilla Amy. Tim Curry as a Romanian capitalist with greed pouring through his veins joins the group. And Ernie Hudson tries his best as the adventurous guide as they go from one limp peril to the next: from a plane ride tailed by heat seeking missiles to a nighttime hippo attack resembling Disneyland's Jungle Cruise  and not even that exciting. The plodding trek leads to a city built around a diamond mine, protected by killer albino gorillas who not only seem like men leaping around in gorilla suits, but are men leaping around in gorilla suits. Yet Amy actually looks realistic, but her forced sentimentality to manipulate audience adoration makes one yearn to throw a banana-grenade in her path, and hopefully her annoyingly idealistic trainer, played by a dull Dylan Walsh, is beside her. Director Frank Marshall was on a roll after ALIVE and ARACHNOPHOBIA, but he overshot here and failed miserably. For More Reviews: cultfilmfreak.com

    I've read the book by Michael Crichton once and I actually found it a little graphic in it's violence, but that's what makes it so enjoyable to read. So, when I heard that Frank Marshall, the producer who worked with Steven Spielberg in the Indiana Jones films, directed this adaptation of the book, I thought it was a very cool idea and would catch my very interest, but going through with all the hatred it had, this film didn't hold up for me, but despite going over the Nostalgia Critic review of this film, however, I thought that this is an OK film. Not good, not bad. Just sort of "There. A test of formal mediocrity." I'm surprised that Roger Ebert himself liked this film, but as for me, I'm calling this a guilty pleasure. There are a few good things that prevented me for giving this movie a much lower rating. The cinematography is surprisingly superb, the scenery is very nice to look at, and Jerry Goldsmith's music score was very riveting. The strongest aspect goes to the cast. Laura Linney did a good job as the strong lead. Dylan Walsh, although not his best performance, gives a good delivery. Tim Curry, however, was OK. His accent didn't interest me, but hey it's acting. What do you expect? In fact, I really liked him here despite the hammy material he's been given. So, please, critics. Stop criticizing the actor. I felt that Joe Don Baker was so annoying because he does nothing other than overreacting and shouting. The best actors in this movie so far goes to Bruce Campbell for his clever personality and Ernie Hudson for his flawless charm and grin. That's it for my praise. So, what do I hate about this movie? Well, there are four problems that didn't leave an impact. First, the Dialogue is easily mediocre. It had some crude material, but at least it had some funny moments ("Stop eating my sesame cake"). Second, the plot deviates itself from the book although it had a great atmosphere in some of the scenes. Third, the directing from Frank Marshall was very inconsistent. And fourth, but not the least, is the movie's cheesy special effects and I didn't get why the monkeys jump into the lava near the end of the film which was the most cheesiest moment. Even the scene in the King Solomons Mine scene was very graphic. I mean, getting your head bashed felt pretty real. Shocking, isn't it? Overall, Congo isn't as horrible as the critics generally said it was, but with a better plot and better special effects, it would have been an astounding film other than a mediocre adaptation of the book written by the same guy who wrote Jurassic Park. Rating: 5.5/10

    Here is my personal review of the 1995 science-fiction/adventure film "Congo," directed by Frank Marshall and produced by Kathleen Kennedy, based on the novel by "Jurassic Park" author Michael Crichton. To start this off, I'll lay down the basic plot of the movie: TraviCom is a major electronics/telecommunications company based in Houston, Texas that sends an expedition to the Congo rain forest in Africa. The expedition's goal is to search for a deposit of extremely valuable, rare diamonds that, in the hands of TraviCom, will change the telecommunications industry overnight. However, SOMETHING slaughters the entire expedition party, and that includes the son of the company CEO that TraviCom employee Karen Ross loves. At the insistence of her boss, Karen Ross links up with Peter Elliot, a California primatetologist and his female gorilla, Amy (whom Peter has taught to paint and speak sign language with the help of an electronic glove). Once the new expedition reaches Africa, they bring on board Monroe Kelly, a "great white hunter who happens to be black" and a Romanian philanthropist named Herkemer Homolka. The expedition faces its fare share of obstacles before finally reaching its destination; the fabled lost city of Zinj, home to the same rare diamonds that the first TraviCom expedition was looking for. Unfortunately for the protagonists, the city of Zinj is home to something deadly: genetically mutated carnivorous gray gorillas, created and trained by the ancient people of Zinj to guard the valuable diamonds. Once the gray gorillas make themselves known, the explorers learn that in the African Congo, YOU ARE THE ENDANGERED SPECIES! If you love Michael Crichton or any movie that takes place in the jungle, this is the movie for you! The story is a well-translated yet slightly different telling of Crichton's story. The characters are well-defined and the acting is on a scale of 1 to 10, a 7. The late special-effects wizard Stan Winston uses amazing, realistic costumes with animatronic masks to breathe life into the signing gorilla Amy and the terrifying gray gorillas. Amy herself is a great character brought to life by both Stan Winston's robotic ape mask and the suit performer who brought out Amy's signing skills out really well. All in all, I love this movie, and everyone who gave it a negative review needs to find a better line of work! Most of "Congo" is flawless with two exceptions. One: for a suspense movie, there were only a few scenes of pure suspense and mostly action. There needed to be more scenes of suspense (such as the gray gorillas picking off people without anyone else knowing or more scenes of pure quiet that could've suddenly exploded with a scare). Also, the origin story of the gray gorillas was merely brushed over and not explained in full. There needed to be a fully-detailed explanation of the gray's origins, such as clues throughout the city that would lead up to the discovery of their origins or an autopsy scene to determine what kind of ape they really were. Besides those two flaws, the rest of "Congo" is pure Crichton, pure adventure, and pure fun. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves Crichton and good-old-fashioned jungle adventure stories.

    The worst Michael Crichton adaptation ever; this makes the abysmal SPHERE seem like JURASSIC PARK. We begin with a failed expedition to find... something mysterious in Africa. A corporation sends Laura Linney to discover where the missing team went. She's joined by an ape researcher and his, through a technical back strap, talking gorilla Amy. Tim Curry as a Romanian capitalist with greed pouring through his veins joins the group. And Ernie Hudson tries his best as the adventurous guide as they go from one limp peril to the next: from a plane ride tailed by heat seeking missiles to a nighttime hippo attack resembling Disneyland's Jungle Cruise  and not even that exciting. The plodding trek leads to a city built around a diamond mine, protected by killer albino gorillas who not only seem like men leaping around in gorilla suits, but are men leaping around in gorilla suits. Yet Amy actually looks realistic, but her forced sentimentality to manipulate audience adoration makes one yearn to throw a banana-grenade in her path, and hopefully her annoyingly idealistic trainer, played by a dull Dylan Walsh, is beside her. Director Frank Marshall was on a roll after ALIVE and ARACHNOPHOBIA, but he overshot here and failed miserably. For More Reviews: cultfilmfreak.com

    I've read the book by Michael Crichton once and I actually found it a little graphic in it's violence, but that's what makes it so enjoyable to read. So, when I heard that Frank Marshall, the producer who worked with Steven Spielberg in the Indiana Jones films, directed this adaptation of the book, I thought it was a very cool idea and would catch my very interest, but going through with all the hatred it had, this film didn't hold up for me, but despite going over the Nostalgia Critic review of this film, however, I thought that this is an OK film. Not good, not bad. Just sort of "There. A test of formal mediocrity." I'm surprised that Roger Ebert himself liked this film, but as for me, I'm calling this a guilty pleasure. There are a few good things that prevented me for giving this movie a much lower rating. The cinematography is surprisingly superb, the scenery is very nice to look at, and Jerry Goldsmith's music score was very riveting. The strongest aspect goes to the cast. Laura Linney did a good job as the strong lead. Dylan Walsh, although not his best performance, gives a good delivery. Tim Curry, however, was OK. His accent didn't interest me, but hey it's acting. What do you expect? In fact, I really liked him here despite the hammy material he's been given. So, please, critics. Stop criticizing the actor. I felt that Joe Don Baker was so annoying because he does nothing other than overreacting and shouting. The best actors in this movie so far goes to Bruce Campbell for his clever personality and Ernie Hudson for his flawless charm and grin. That's it for my praise. So, what do I hate about this movie? Well, there are four problems that didn't leave an impact. First, the Dialogue is easily mediocre. It had some crude material, but at least it had some funny moments ("Stop eating my sesame cake"). Second, the plot deviates itself from the book although it had a great atmosphere in some of the scenes. Third, the directing from Frank Marshall was very inconsistent. And fourth, but not the least, is the movie's cheesy special effects and I didn't get why the monkeys jump into the lava near the end of the film which was the most cheesiest moment. Even the scene in the King Solomons Mine scene was very graphic. I mean, getting your head bashed felt pretty real. Shocking, isn't it? Overall, Congo isn't as horrible as the critics generally said it was, but with a better plot and better special effects, it would have been an astounding film other than a mediocre adaptation of the book written by the same guy who wrote Jurassic Park. Rating: 5.5/10

    A megalomaniac C.E.O. sends his son into the dangerous African Congo on a quest for a source of diamonds large enough and pure enough to function as powerful laser communications transmitters. When contact is lost with his son and the team, his sometime daughter- in-law is sent after them. She is a former CIA operative and, accompanied by gee-whiz gadgetry and a few eccentric characters and sets out to rescue her former fianc&eacute;. What they all discover is that often what we most want turns out to be the source of our downfall. yes, the film was basically selling itself as the new Jurassic Park, and while it's nowhere near as good as that behemoth, it still has it's moments. Despite the poor script, there are some good characters here who really make you want to like the film more. Curry as always is the one with a secret, Linney plays the straight woman, but most of all, it's Hudson here who really steals the show. With his tongue firmly in cheek, he spouts his lines with cheesy glee stealing the thunder from anyone else. Effects are not the best, but i think it adds to the films silly charm. Not to be taken seriously, just a big silly movie.

    Congo is a modern day Indiana Jones, or more specifically, a modern day King Solomon's Mines. It's a great movie with everything you would expect to be in an adventure movie: monsters, lost cities, a war in the background, and a group of daring adventurers. What sets this movie apart are the personalities of the adventurers. The party is made up of four groups. There is the communications corporation which is sending a team deep into the Congo to find out what happened to a previous team. The corporation wants some flawless diamonds for its laser and will do anything to get it. There are the scientists that are going into the Congo to return an ape to her natural environment, there is the archaeologist that is searching for the lost city, and then there are the mercenaries. The groups are interesting for the scientists are very open with what they want. Their ape, Amy, wants to return to the jungle so they are taking her. The mercenaries are being paid so they are happy. The secrets come in with the communications corporation and the archaeologist. They both refuse to reveal the true reason for their journey, and the truth has to be drawn out from them, which the mercenary leader manages to do. The original story is by Michael Crichton, so one can expect a little social comment in it. Once again the comment is about man playing God. The ancient city genetically created a breed of killer apes to guard the diamond mines. The apes were so vicious and uncontrollable they turn on their masters and killed them. Now nobody can go to the city because the apes will kill them. The subtle point is that the scientists are teaching the ape, Amy, to talk. What we see in the movie is the beginning of the experiment, and the end result. The ancients did what the scientists are trying to do and ended up creating a monster that they could not destroy. Congo seems to also reveal the true power of nature. Though there are lots of threats from humanity, such as the war in Zaire and the apes, they are also threatened by nature. The volcano that the city is built on is rumbling and ready to explode. This is the more obvious note. We also are confronted with other creatures, such as the Hippo and the Silverback Gorilla. The hippopotamus (greek for River Horse) may seem like a placid creature, but in the wild they are brutes. When I first saw the movie I thought that they were crocodiles until I realised that they were really hippos. Then there is the Silverback. When they are confronted with it, one suddenly realises that that creature could rip a full-grown man apart. Not something to trifle with. Congo is a great little adventure movie with everything one would expect in such a movie. The action keeps on coming and the characters are all interesting. The best thing is, they didn't kill of my favourite character in the end. But then again, you would expect him to know a little bit about staying alive.

    After the mega-success of Spielberg's Jurassic Park in 1993, I imagine that producers were all over author Michael Crichton's back catalogue in search of another potential box-office hit; featuring untamed wilderness, a cute talking gorilla, some far less appealing killer apes, a laser weapon, King Solomon's lost diamond mines, and an exploding volcano, exotic, jungle-based adventure Congo was a natural choice for the block-buster approach. Directed by Frank Marshall, the film made a healthy profit, but the critics tore the film apart, clearly of the opinion that this heady concoction of action, horror, industrial intrigue, drama and warfare was no match for Mel Gibson in a kilt or a talking pig. But then what do critics know anyway? This might not be a superlative piece of cinemaJohn Patrick Shanley's screenplay conveys no meaningful message, Frank Marshall never advances the art of film-making with his direction, and one needn't bother looking for any Oscar-worthy performancesbut Congo still proves to be hugely entertaining nonsense, a whole lot of cheesy, big budget fun, with cool creature effects (the gorilla suits were by FX legend Stan Winston), impressive set design, some decent action set-pieces, a wonderfully camp performance from Tim Curry as Romanian treasure seeker Herkermer Homolka, a neat cameo from Bruce Campbell, lovely Laura Linney and her delightful dimples, and some truly manky monkeys (OK, so technically they're apes, but for the purpose of alliteration, they're monkeys!). And that's got 'entertaining' stamped all over it as far as I am concerned.

    Based on Michael Crichton's novel, film is about a research/rescue team sent into the African Congo, and led by Dr. Karen Ross(Laura Linney) that includes Dr. Peter Elliot(Dylan Walsh) who has with him a talking gorilla(due to a new technology in her larynx). Tim Curry and Ernie Hudson play devious characters who are also along for the mission. They are sent to locate the first research team that had apparently located some large and pure diamonds that are worth a fortune to the company funding the expeditions. Complicating matters are the instability of the local government, and a rumored mythical race of apes said to live deep in the jungle. As it turns out, they are no myth... Lightweight adventure yarn is watchable to a point, but too silly and outlandish to succeed, though it remains innocuous.

    It's not clear whether this bone-brained B-movie adventure is a spoof, an homage or a straight-faced misfire, but it's not much fun whichever way you look at it. Based on Michael Crichton's so-so novel, it's a nutty mixture of lost cities, giant hippos, monster monkeys, unconvincing visual effects and corny dialogue. The first sign that the movie isn't going to work is the gorilla that communicates in sign language, and needless to say the film doesn't get any better from that point on. Making all this old rope somewhat worthwhile are Tim Curry, feverishly hamming it up with a bizarre accent that defies identification, and Ernie Hudson, who also seems aware that this is all a load of old rubbish.

    The movie Congo is hushedly giantly appealing; Congo's viewing is very attractive for some reasons. Congo has these beautiful landscapes with great 'geothermal' colors, first-class budgeted production effects, and an awesomely themed story about killer gorillas, silver, killer gorillas at that. People are profoundly interested in the great apes, curious to know their ways, how smart that they are, and if they're dangerous or not. Congo interests in that. Also, Congo's a gentle, unmalicious viewing which so helps in strengthening its gorier moments, and it's backed by a drastically popular novel, oh, and it has lava! All this, and what else, makes it very largely appealing. Ooo! Ooo! I know what else! The beautiful Laura Linney! I can't forget about her! She's, really like, perfect, for the part. This is Linney's great starring role in Congo. I think she knocked it out of the park. Laura is more infatuating in a leading role than she is in her supporting roles even. Once the team gets to the Congo, Congo starts getting better. If you're expecting some Hollywood blockbuster typical-type movie, you're not gonna get it here. Is it just me, or do gorilla suits look exactly like real gorillas?

    It doesn't deserve any special attention, obviously not for any redeeming qualities but nor is it particularly bad either. Don't take me wrong, it does miss the mark almost entirely, although the budget can be clearly seen throughout from the star-studded cast to the various and elaborate set designs. The special effects are OK too; what this movie lacks is any kind of imagination or shred of originality to lift it up from it's generic trappings that most mediocre movies fall victim to. A movie about killer apes, it's gotta be at least kind of cool, right? There is maybe about fifteen minutes of screen time that even involves said killer apes, let alone shows them, and it is (of course) wedged somewhere in to the latter portion of the third act. There is a friendly gorilla who is a consistent character throughout the movie. Amy, the "talking gorilla", is about the only thing (besides Tim Curry) that won me over, but after about the first hour, it actually begins to feel like a movie about people with a gorilla character, not a movie about gorillas. You know the kind of bad movie in which after a long while, you notice it's just been different scenes of the characters talking to each other the whole time, well after it should have started to deliver? Yeah, if you've seen a lot of movies, you know what I mean. Congo could have easily had about twenty minutes shaved off, being stuffed full of useless and distracting development. My review (if accepted, after I write this) will likely be wedged somewhere in the back, never to be read by anyone else who grew up with the name Congo in the back of their mind and are curious about that 90s blockbuster about killer apes, and will be put behind the apparently favored "it's fun to watch" reviews, but let at least one person tell you; it's silly, it's convoluted and pointless, it's disappointing. It just kind of insults your intelligence and for the time period that it came out, it could have been at least a little better.

    After the mega-success of Spielberg's Jurassic Park in 1993, I imagine that producers were all over author Michael Crichton's back catalogue in search of another potential box-office hit; featuring untamed wilderness, a cute talking gorilla, some far less appealing killer apes, a laser weapon, King Solomon's lost diamond mines, and an exploding volcano, exotic, jungle-based adventure Congo was a natural choice for the block-buster approach. Directed by Frank Marshall, the film made a healthy profit, but the critics tore the film apart, clearly of the opinion that this heady concoction of action, horror, industrial intrigue, drama and warfare was no match for Mel Gibson in a kilt or a talking pig. But then what do critics know anyway? This might not be a superlative piece of cinemaJohn Patrick Shanley's screenplay conveys no meaningful message, Frank Marshall never advances the art of film-making with his direction, and one needn't bother looking for any Oscar-worthy performancesbut Congo still proves to be hugely entertaining nonsense, a whole lot of cheesy, big budget fun, with cool creature effects (the gorilla suits were by FX legend Stan Winston), impressive set design, some decent action set-pieces, a wonderfully camp performance from Tim Curry as Romanian treasure seeker Herkermer Homolka, a neat cameo from Bruce Campbell, lovely Laura Linney and her delightful dimples, and some truly manky monkeys (OK, so technically they're apes, but for the purpose of alliteration, they're monkeys!). And that's got 'entertaining' stamped all over it as far as I am concerned.

    Based on Michael Crichton's novel, film is about a research/rescue team sent into the African Congo, and led by Dr. Karen Ross(Laura Linney) that includes Dr. Peter Elliot(Dylan Walsh) who has with him a talking gorilla(due to a new technology in her larynx). Tim Curry and Ernie Hudson play devious characters who are also along for the mission. They are sent to locate the first research team that had apparently located some large and pure diamonds that are worth a fortune to the company funding the expeditions. Complicating matters are the instability of the local government, and a rumored mythical race of apes said to live deep in the jungle. As it turns out, they are no myth... Lightweight adventure yarn is watchable to a point, but too silly and outlandish to succeed, though it remains innocuous.

    It's not clear whether this bone-brained B-movie adventure is a spoof, an homage or a straight-faced misfire, but it's not much fun whichever way you look at it. Based on Michael Crichton's so-so novel, it's a nutty mixture of lost cities, giant hippos, monster monkeys, unconvincing visual effects and corny dialogue. The first sign that the movie isn't going to work is the gorilla that communicates in sign language, and needless to say the film doesn't get any better from that point on. Making all this old rope somewhat worthwhile are Tim Curry, feverishly hamming it up with a bizarre accent that defies identification, and Ernie Hudson, who also seems aware that this is all a load of old rubbish.

    The movie Congo is hushedly giantly appealing; Congo's viewing is very attractive for some reasons. Congo has these beautiful landscapes with great 'geothermal' colors, first-class budgeted production effects, and an awesomely themed story about killer gorillas, silver, killer gorillas at that. People are profoundly interested in the great apes, curious to know their ways, how smart that they are, and if they're dangerous or not. Congo interests in that. Also, Congo's a gentle, unmalicious viewing which so helps in strengthening its gorier moments, and it's backed by a drastically popular novel, oh, and it has lava! All this, and what else, makes it very largely appealing. Ooo! Ooo! I know what else! The beautiful Laura Linney! I can't forget about her! She's, really like, perfect, for the part. This is Linney's great starring role in Congo. I think she knocked it out of the park. Laura is more infatuating in a leading role than she is in her supporting roles even. Once the team gets to the Congo, Congo starts getting better. If you're expecting some Hollywood blockbuster typical-type movie, you're not gonna get it here. Is it just me, or do gorilla suits look exactly like real gorillas?

    It doesn't deserve any special attention, obviously not for any redeeming qualities but nor is it particularly bad either. Don't take me wrong, it does miss the mark almost entirely, although the budget can be clearly seen throughout from the star-studded cast to the various and elaborate set designs. The special effects are OK too; what this movie lacks is any kind of imagination or shred of originality to lift it up from it's generic trappings that most mediocre movies fall victim to. A movie about killer apes, it's gotta be at least kind of cool, right? There is maybe about fifteen minutes of screen time that even involves said killer apes, let alone shows them, and it is (of course) wedged somewhere in to the latter portion of the third act. There is a friendly gorilla who is a consistent character throughout the movie. Amy, the "talking gorilla", is about the only thing (besides Tim Curry) that won me over, but after about the first hour, it actually begins to feel like a movie about people with a gorilla character, not a movie about gorillas. You know the kind of bad movie in which after a long while, you notice it's just been different scenes of the characters talking to each other the whole time, well after it should have started to deliver? Yeah, if you've seen a lot of movies, you know what I mean. Congo could have easily had about twenty minutes shaved off, being stuffed full of useless and distracting development. My review (if accepted, after I write this) will likely be wedged somewhere in the back, never to be read by anyone else who grew up with the name Congo in the back of their mind and are curious about that 90s blockbuster about killer apes, and will be put behind the apparently favored "it's fun to watch" reviews, but let at least one person tell you; it's silly, it's convoluted and pointless, it's disappointing. It just kind of insults your intelligence and for the time period that it came out, it could have been at least a little better.

    Here is my personal review of the 1995 science-fiction/adventure film "Congo," directed by Frank Marshall and produced by Kathleen Kennedy, based on the novel by "Jurassic Park" author Michael Crichton. To start this off, I'll lay down the basic plot of the movie: TraviCom is a major electronics/telecommunications company based in Houston, Texas that sends an expedition to the Congo rain forest in Africa. The expedition's goal is to search for a deposit of extremely valuable, rare diamonds that, in the hands of TraviCom, will change the telecommunications industry overnight. However, SOMETHING slaughters the entire expedition party, and that includes the son of the company CEO that TraviCom employee Karen Ross loves. At the insistence of her boss, Karen Ross links up with Peter Elliot, a California primatetologist and his female gorilla, Amy (whom Peter has taught to paint and speak sign language with the help of an electronic glove). Once the new expedition reaches Africa, they bring on board Monroe Kelly, a "great white hunter who happens to be black" and a Romanian philanthropist named Herkemer Homolka. The expedition faces its fare share of obstacles before finally reaching its destination; the fabled lost city of Zinj, home to the same rare diamonds that the first TraviCom expedition was looking for. Unfortunately for the protagonists, the city of Zinj is home to something deadly: genetically mutated carnivorous gray gorillas, created and trained by the ancient people of Zinj to guard the valuable diamonds. Once the gray gorillas make themselves known, the explorers learn that in the African Congo, YOU ARE THE ENDANGERED SPECIES! If you love Michael Crichton or any movie that takes place in the jungle, this is the movie for you! The story is a well-translated yet slightly different telling of Crichton's story. The characters are well-defined and the acting is on a scale of 1 to 10, a 7. The late special-effects wizard Stan Winston uses amazing, realistic costumes with animatronic masks to breathe life into the signing gorilla Amy and the terrifying gray gorillas. Amy herself is a great character brought to life by both Stan Winston's robotic ape mask and the suit performer who brought out Amy's signing skills out really well. All in all, I love this movie, and everyone who gave it a negative review needs to find a better line of work! Most of "Congo" is flawless with two exceptions. One: for a suspense movie, there were only a few scenes of pure suspense and mostly action. There needed to be more scenes of suspense (such as the gray gorillas picking off people without anyone else knowing or more scenes of pure quiet that could've suddenly exploded with a scare). Also, the origin story of the gray gorillas was merely brushed over and not explained in full. There needed to be a fully-detailed explanation of the gray's origins, such as clues throughout the city that would lead up to the discovery of their origins or an autopsy scene to determine what kind of ape they really were. Besides those two flaws, the rest of "Congo" is pure Crichton, pure adventure, and pure fun. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves Crichton and good-old-fashioned jungle adventure stories.

    The worst Michael Crichton adaptation ever; this makes the abysmal SPHERE seem like JURASSIC PARK. We begin with a failed expedition to find... something mysterious in Africa. A corporation sends Laura Linney to discover where the missing team went. She's joined by an ape researcher and his, through a technical back strap, talking gorilla Amy. Tim Curry as a Romanian capitalist with greed pouring through his veins joins the group. And Ernie Hudson tries his best as the adventurous guide as they go from one limp peril to the next: from a plane ride tailed by heat seeking missiles to a nighttime hippo attack resembling Disneyland's Jungle Cruise  and not even that exciting. The plodding trek leads to a city built around a diamond mine, protected by killer albino gorillas who not only seem like men leaping around in gorilla suits, but are men leaping around in gorilla suits. Yet Amy actually looks realistic, but her forced sentimentality to manipulate audience adoration makes one yearn to throw a banana-grenade in her path, and hopefully her annoyingly idealistic trainer, played by a dull Dylan Walsh, is beside her. Director Frank Marshall was on a roll after ALIVE and ARACHNOPHOBIA, but he overshot here and failed miserably. For More Reviews: cultfilmfreak.com

    I've read the book by Michael Crichton once and I actually found it a little graphic in it's violence, but that's what makes it so enjoyable to read. So, when I heard that Frank Marshall, the producer who worked with Steven Spielberg in the Indiana Jones films, directed this adaptation of the book, I thought it was a very cool idea and would catch my very interest, but going through with all the hatred it had, this film didn't hold up for me, but despite going over the Nostalgia Critic review of this film, however, I thought that this is an OK film. Not good, not bad. Just sort of "There. A test of formal mediocrity." I'm surprised that Roger Ebert himself liked this film, but as for me, I'm calling this a guilty pleasure. There are a few good things that prevented me for giving this movie a much lower rating. The cinematography is surprisingly superb, the scenery is very nice to look at, and Jerry Goldsmith's music score was very riveting. The strongest aspect goes to the cast. Laura Linney did a good job as the strong lead. Dylan Walsh, although not his best performance, gives a good delivery. Tim Curry, however, was OK. His accent didn't interest me, but hey it's acting. What do you expect? In fact, I really liked him here despite the hammy material he's been given. So, please, critics. Stop criticizing the actor. I felt that Joe Don Baker was so annoying because he does nothing other than overreacting and shouting. The best actors in this movie so far goes to Bruce Campbell for his clever personality and Ernie Hudson for his flawless charm and grin. That's it for my praise. So, what do I hate about this movie? Well, there are four problems that didn't leave an impact. First, the Dialogue is easily mediocre. It had some crude material, but at least it had some funny moments ("Stop eating my sesame cake"). Second, the plot deviates itself from the book although it had a great atmosphere in some of the scenes. Third, the directing from Frank Marshall was very inconsistent. And fourth, but not the least, is the movie's cheesy special effects and I didn't get why the monkeys jump into the lava near the end of the film which was the most cheesiest moment. Even the scene in the King Solomons Mine scene was very graphic. I mean, getting your head bashed felt pretty real. Shocking, isn't it? Overall, Congo isn't as horrible as the critics generally said it was, but with a better plot and better special effects, it would have been an astounding film other than a mediocre adaptation of the book written by the same guy who wrote Jurassic Park. Rating: 5.5/10

    A megalomaniac C.E.O. sends his son into the dangerous African Congo on a quest for a source of diamonds large enough and pure enough to function as powerful laser communications transmitters. When contact is lost with his son and the team, his sometime daughter- in-law is sent after them. She is a former CIA operative and, accompanied by gee-whiz gadgetry and a few eccentric characters and sets out to rescue her former fianc&eacute;. What they all discover is that often what we most want turns out to be the source of our downfall. yes, the film was basically selling itself as the new Jurassic Park, and while it's nowhere near as good as that behemoth, it still has it's moments. Despite the poor script, there are some good characters here who really make you want to like the film more. Curry as always is the one with a secret, Linney plays the straight woman, but most of all, it's Hudson here who really steals the show. With his tongue firmly in cheek, he spouts his lines with cheesy glee stealing the thunder from anyone else. Effects are not the best, but i think it adds to the films silly charm. Not to be taken seriously, just a big silly movie.

    Congo is a modern day Indiana Jones, or more specifically, a modern day King Solomon's Mines. It's a great movie with everything you would expect to be in an adventure movie: monsters, lost cities, a war in the background, and a group of daring adventurers. What sets this movie apart are the personalities of the adventurers. The party is made up of four groups. There is the communications corporation which is sending a team deep into the Congo to find out what happened to a previous team. The corporation wants some flawless diamonds for its laser and will do anything to get it. There are the scientists that are going into the Congo to return an ape to her natural environment, there is the archaeologist that is searching for the lost city, and then there are the mercenaries. The groups are interesting for the scientists are very open with what they want. Their ape, Amy, wants to return to the jungle so they are taking her. The mercenaries are being paid so they are happy. The secrets come in with the communications corporation and the archaeologist. They both refuse to reveal the true reason for their journey, and the truth has to be drawn out from them, which the mercenary leader manages to do. The original story is by Michael Crichton, so one can expect a little social comment in it. Once again the comment is about man playing God. The ancient city genetically created a breed of killer apes to guard the diamond mines. The apes were so vicious and uncontrollable they turn on their masters and killed them. Now nobody can go to the city because the apes will kill them. The subtle point is that the scientists are teaching the ape, Amy, to talk. What we see in the movie is the beginning of the experiment, and the end result. The ancients did what the scientists are trying to do and ended up creating a monster that they could not destroy. Congo seems to also reveal the true power of nature. Though there are lots of threats from humanity, such as the war in Zaire and the apes, they are also threatened by nature. The volcano that the city is built on is rumbling and ready to explode. This is the more obvious note. We also are confronted with other creatures, such as the Hippo and the Silverback Gorilla. The hippopotamus (greek for River Horse) may seem like a placid creature, but in the wild they are brutes. When I first saw the movie I thought that they were crocodiles until I realised that they were really hippos. Then there is the Silverback. When they are confronted with it, one suddenly realises that that creature could rip a full-grown man apart. Not something to trifle with. Congo is a great little adventure movie with everything one would expect in such a movie. The action keeps on coming and the characters are all interesting. The best thing is, they didn't kill of my favourite character in the end. But then again, you would expect him to know a little bit about staying alive.

Once the new expedition reaches Africa, they bring on board Monroe Kelly, a "great white hunter who happens to be black" and a Romanian philanthropist named Herkemer Homolka. The expedition faces its fare share of obstacles before finally reaching its destination; the fabled lost city of Zinj, home to the same rare diamonds that the first TraviCom expedition was looking for.

Yet Amy actually looks realistic, but her forced sentimentality to manipulate audience adoration makes one yearn to throw a banana-grenade in her path, and hopefully her annoyingly idealistic trainer, played by a dull Dylan Walsh, is beside her. Director Frank Marshall was on a roll after ALIVE and ARACHNOPHOBIA, but he overshot here and failed miserably. For More Reviews: cultfilmfreak.com

    I've read the book by Michael Crichton once and I actually found it a little graphic in it's violence, but that's what makes it so enjoyable to read. So, when I heard that Frank Marshall, the producer who worked with Steven Spielberg in the Indiana Jones films, directed this adaptation of the book, I thought it was a very cool idea and would catch my very interest, but going through with all the hatred it had, this film didn't hold up for me, but despite going over the Nostalgia Critic review of this film, however, I thought that this is an OK film. Not good, not bad. Just sort of "There. A test of formal mediocrity." I'm surprised that Roger Ebert himself liked this film, but as for me, I'm calling this a guilty pleasure. There are a few good things that prevented me for giving this movie a much lower rating. The cinematography is surprisingly superb, the scenery is very nice to look at, and Jerry Goldsmith's music score was very riveting. The strongest aspect goes to the cast. Laura Linney did a good job as the strong lead. Dylan Walsh, although not his best performance, gives a good delivery. Tim Curry, however, was OK. His accent didn't interest me, but hey it's acting. What do you expect? In fact, I really liked him here despite the hammy material he's been given. So, please, critics. Stop criticizing the actor. I felt that Joe Don Baker was so annoying because he does nothing other than overreacting and shouting. The best actors in this movie so far goes to Bruce Campbell for his clever personality and Ernie Hudson for his flawless charm and grin. That's it for my praise. So, what do I hate about this movie? Well, there are four problems that didn't leave an impact. First, the Dialogue is easily mediocre. It had some crude material, but at least it had some funny moments ("Stop eating my sesame cake"). Second, the plot deviates itself from the book although it had a great atmosphere in some of the scenes. Third, the directing from Frank Marshall was very inconsistent. And fourth, but not the least, is the movie's cheesy special effects and I didn't get why the monkeys jump into the lava near the end of the film which was the most cheesiest moment. Even the scene in the King Solomons Mine scene was very graphic. I mean, getting your head bashed felt pretty real. Shocking, isn't it? Overall, Congo isn't as horrible as the critics generally said it was, but with a better plot and better special effects, it would have been an astounding film other than a mediocre adaptation of the book written by the same guy who wrote Jurassic Park. Rating: 5.5/10

    A megalomaniac C.E.O. sends his son into the dangerous African Congo on a quest for a source of diamonds large enough and pure enough to function as powerful laser communications transmitters. When contact is lost with his son and the team, his sometime daughter- in-law is sent after them. She is a former CIA operative and, accompanied by gee-whiz gadgetry and a few eccentric characters and sets out to rescue her former fianc&eacute;. What they all discover is that often what we most want turns out to be the source of our downfall. yes, the film was basically selling itself as the new Jurassic Park, and while it's nowhere near as good as that behemoth, it still has it's moments. Despite the poor script, there are some good characters here who really make you want to like the film more. Curry as always is the one with a secret, Linney plays the straight woman, but most of all, it's Hudson here who really steals the show. With his tongue firmly in cheek, he spouts his lines with cheesy glee stealing the thunder from anyone else. Effects are not the best, but i think it adds to the films silly charm. Not to be taken seriously, just a big silly movie.

    Congo is a modern day Indiana Jones, or more specifically, a modern day King Solomon's Mines. It's a great movie with everything you would expect to be in an adventure movie: monsters, lost cities, a war in the background, and a group of daring adventurers. What sets this movie apart are the personalities of the adventurers. The party is made up of four groups. There is the communications corporation which is sending a team deep into the Congo to find out what happened to a previous team. The corporation wants some flawless diamonds for its laser and will do anything to get it. There are the scientists that are going into the Congo to return an ape to her natural environment, there is the archaeologist that is searching for the lost city, and then there are the mercenaries. The groups are interesting for the scientists are very open with what they want. Their ape, Amy, wants to return to the jungle so they are taking her. The mercenaries are being paid so they are happy. The secrets come in with the communications corporation and the archaeologist. They both refuse to reveal the true reason for their journey, and the truth has to be drawn out from them, which the mercenary leader manages to do. The original story is by Michael Crichton, so one can expect a little social comment in it. Once again the comment is about man playing God. The ancient city genetically created a breed of killer apes to guard the diamond mines. The apes were so vicious and uncontrollable they turn on their masters and killed them. Now nobody can go to the city because the apes will kill them. The subtle point is that the scientists are teaching the ape, Amy, to talk. What we see in the movie is the beginning of the experiment, and the end result. The ancients did what the scientists are trying to do and ended up creating a monster that they could not destroy. Congo seems to also reveal the true power of nature. Though there are lots of threats from humanity, such as the war in Zaire and the apes, they are also threatened by nature. The volcano that the city is built on is rumbling and ready to explode. This is the more obvious note. We also are confronted with other creatures, such as the Hippo and the Silverback Gorilla. The hippopotamus (greek for River Horse) may seem like a placid creature, but in the wild they are brutes. When I first saw the movie I thought that they were crocodiles until I realised that they were really hippos. Then there is the Silverback. When they are confronted with it, one suddenly realises that that creature could rip a full-grown man apart. Not something to trifle with. Congo is a great little adventure movie with everything one would expect in such a movie. The action keeps on coming and the characters are all interesting. The best thing is, they didn't kill of my favourite character in the end. But then again, you would expect him to know a little bit about staying alive.

    After the mega-success of Spielberg's Jurassic Park in 1993, I imagine that producers were all over author Michael Crichton's back catalogue in search of another potential box-office hit; featuring untamed wilderness, a cute talking gorilla, some far less appealing killer apes, a laser weapon, King Solomon's lost diamond mines, and an exploding volcano, exotic, jungle-based adventure Congo was a natural choice for the block-buster approach. Directed by Frank Marshall, the film made a healthy profit, but the critics tore the film apart, clearly of the opinion that this heady concoction of action, horror, industrial intrigue, drama and warfare was no match for Mel Gibson in a kilt or a talking pig. But then what do critics know anyway? This might not be a superlative piece of cinemaJohn Patrick Shanley's screenplay conveys no meaningful message, Frank Marshall never advances the art of film-making with his direction, and one needn't bother looking for any Oscar-worthy performancesbut Congo still proves to be hugely entertaining nonsense, a whole lot of cheesy, big budget fun, with cool creature effects (the gorilla suits were by FX legend Stan Winston), impressive set design, some decent action set-pieces, a wonderfully camp performance from Tim Curry as Romanian treasure seeker Herkermer Homolka, a neat cameo from Bruce Campbell, lovely Laura Linney and her delightful dimples, and some truly manky monkeys (OK, so technically they're apes, but for the purpose of alliteration, they're monkeys!). And that's got 'entertaining' stamped all over it as far as I am concerned.
