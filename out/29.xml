 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  The Dark Knight of Gotham City confronts a dastardly duo: Two-Face and the Riddler.

    Batman Forever was the highly anticipated third film in the, up until this point hugely successful Batman series. Before Batman Forever Tim Burton had provided us with two absolutely mindblowing and never before seen adaptations of the Dark Knight on film. His dark, Gothic take on the comic book character was a perfect match and because of this Batman was no longer the camp, jokey image of the 60's, but a new true hero for the modern age. The film and it's sequel Batman & Robin are probably the best examples in movie history of what happens when a studio interferes with the creative process in order to make more money. Batman Forever, while still retaining some of the moody imagery of Burton, is a dumbed down, jokey, made for kids adventure that saw the series take a major downturn. The film has very high production values but these are lost in a sea of garish neon colours and odd camera angles. Director Joel Schumacher, a fine director in his own right seems to know absolutely nothing about the characters at all and we are left with a very find cast who seem to be winging it. Val Kilmer replaces the excellent Michael Keaton and to be fair, he has the look and the ability to pull of the character with ease but even he looks lost, unenthusiastic and probably wondering what the hell happened. No one can blame him for accepting the role without reading the script, based on the previous two movies I think anyone would kill to be in that position but it just didn't come off the way anyone expected and he was right not to return. The script is mostly terrible, jam packed full of juvenile humour which completely deflates any of the more serious scenes in the film (Of which there are quite a lot and are reasonably well done). The biggest joke in the film is the villains. Played completely like cartoon characters, there is zero sense of danger from two face and the Riddler. Tommy Lee Jones looks like he's having a real laugh playing two face which has a lot of energy but it is true that he seems to be taking his performance based on Jack Nicholson's Joker and Jim Carey, a man whom I normally love in films and thought was a perfect choice for the role, is just really Ace Ventura in a green suit for the whole film. A shame because I consider Carey a fine actor and would love to have seen that manic side used to portray a truly psychotic and evil version of the character. Instead we get humour of 5 year olds, terrible dialogue and cartoon boing sound effects. The film does have many good points, the cinematography is lush, it's a good length with plenty of other serious sub-plots to keep you interested. Chris O' Donnel excellent as Dick Grayson/Robin and he brings a real sense of seriousness and emotion to the film with his scenes. The big bonus is that Batman Forever provides more screen time to the wonderful Michael Gough who stayed on as butler Alfred from the Burton films. Batman Forever's biggest failing is that it tries to be a part of the world that the Burton films created. Had it been a fresh reboot it might have worked in it's own right. Essentially the filmmakers took what made the previous two films so popular, the moody and bizarre darkness and watered it down to a milky, money making fluid in order to get kids bums on cinema seats and it was pretty obviously done as well. There was a reason why Batman and Batman Returns did so well at the box office and have endured over the years with fans. Batman Forever did exceptionally well also but a lower age rating and a great franchise reputation were almost completely responsible for this success. If you are on a Batman Film binge then 'Forever' is worth tacking on to the end of the first two if you need more, but this is where things started to really go downhill.

    Batman Forever saw Val Kilmar make his debut as the Dark Knight and also a new director as Joel Schumacher comes on board. When Warner Brothers decided to replace director Tim Burton for a more slapstick style for the third installment of the franchise, many wondered if Joel Schumacher would match the award winning Batman Returns. Sadly more question marks surrounded Batman Forever then the latest Riddler outfit. In Batman Returns we had Michelle Pfeiffer in her charismatic role as Catwoman and Danny Devito as the scheming Pengiun. Now we are supplied with a over the top performance from Jim Carrey as he takes the role of the Riddler. Tommy Lee Jones gave a creditable performance as Two-Face although you wonder if he was what character he was playing as on a few occasions he reminded you more of the Joker, although it is fair to say this was probably caused by how the film was scripted rather then a actor's input. If your looking for a non stop action entertainment flick this will not disappoint but for those who are looking for more the same of Burton's earlier work it's best you give this one a miss.

    I am astonished looking at the reviews I'm reading here "reviewing" this movie. hm, more like bashing it. I've never seen a more pompous bunch of self righteous internet morons then the ones you see within the superhero fanboy community, Especially now in aftermath of the Chris Nolan "dark knight" movies (more like Dork knight). I have never seen a series of supposed "superhero" movie's take itself so damn seriously in my life. Did Nolan forget these movies are about a guy in a cape who dresses like a freaking BAT? I mean, yes we have to believe in it to some degree, but there's only so far you can go with trying to "legitimize" a comic book superhero. For crying out loud, he made the batmobile into a tank. A TANK! my Lord, that's the dumbest thing ever. So, here we have Batman Forever, a favorite childhood film of mine that I must have watched a million times on video along with the other 2 batman films. Its a film that does NOT take itself ultra seriously, a visual feast for the eyes and senses. It can indulge in its over the top comic book origins and knows how to have fun with it. People saying batman has to always be dark and beating criminals up to a bloody pulp are ignorant and have not seen or read many comic books, as this film is purposely taking its cue from the 40's and 50's comics which has sillier humorous elements but still were taking itself seriously. This is the BLOCKBUSTER batman that was much needed after the pretty depressing if misunderstood Batman Returns. This was wild summer entertainment in that year of 1995, everything was so great. Jim Carrey was at the top of his game with the ace ventura films, the Mask, dumb and dumber and is a riot as the Riddler. Tommy Lee Jones is a clearly having a blast as two-face, Nicole kidman has never ever been sexier then she is here. Val Kilmer may not be as quirky cool as Michael Keaton, but he looks great in the suit and is very physical, and batman has 2 of them in this movie including the "sonar" suit. Robin is brought in, and done convincingly well, not a corny Burt Ward robin at all. Pity he went from tough vengeful crime fighter to corny goofball in the next one, but here he is as a modern robin should be, tough with a sense of humor and not at all a goofball so its you can take him seriously. Gotham city is vibrant and lit up for the first time, which looks pretty spectacular. Batmans got a host of new rides including a more supped up batmobile with what I always thought was really neat blue lights through the ribbing, as well as a new batboat and batplane. The action scenes are incredible, things like the batmobile climbing up the wall, the bat boat and bat plane riding to claw island, batman and robin running into the bat signal. The iconic moments are there and it makes the film hugely enjoyable. unlike the recent overly serious drivel, this is a comic book film that's not at all afraid of being a comic book film. No attempt to be anything more the an amazing action adventure fantasy and it can be enjoyed by pretty much anyone. I watched this as a kid, loved it then, love it now. Saw the new ones and went what the hell did they do to my favorite superhero? Sad day. The "complaints" that you read about all the time by the nerds are, well, stupid. Yes, stupid. They cry the usual same mantra they have for years, "batnipples!" and "neon!", when the fact is, who REALLY cares about these things when actually watching the film? Do these minor details really destroy the entire film for these unfortunate people? Well, despite the losers down rating this, the fact is the film was hugely successful back in the day and most people still seem to enjoy it, and why not? It a very easy film to watch and its not SO kiddy as to block off all adult watchers. Comic book movies trying to be as realistic and dumb as they have been, I look at it like what a waste. The Batman film's used to be fun, inventive, wild and imaginative, as evidenced in this film. They filled the kid's as well as the adults with a sense of awe and wonder. Now hes a bore, catering to a society that has lost all sense of creativity and imagination. I think they should have stopped at Batman & Robin, because they are not getting any better, only worse.

    It's quite sad for me to watch Batman Forever, because it just doesn't live up to the first Batman film (Tim Burton's successful dark noir). Granted though, it is much better than it's sequel, Batman & Robin. An interesting thing I find is that the film is reasonably well cast; Val Kilmer isn't as awful as Clooney - doesn't really live up to Keaton and definitely not Bale - , Tommy Lee Jones was actually a pretty good casting for Harvey Dent/ Two-Face and Jim Carrey is...alright - he plays himself...again. Though I must talk about the Riddler, he is my all time favourite Batman villain. In the comics and the Arkham games, he is a mysterious man - in fact, he's a bit like Jigsaw from the Saw franchise - and has brilliant dress sense, these are the reasons I love him as a character. In Joel Schumacher's attempt, he is compelety the opposite; he is loud and has no panache, he could be slightly mysterious at times; like when he left all sorts of clues for Bruce, however, even then he started shouting about it. Don't even get me started on his attire - a full body spandex suit, true to the early comics but not the Riddler I fell in love with! Nicole Kidman's part was utterly pointless. Where did Vicki Vale and Selina Kyle disappear off to in the last films? Why is it that in every one of the Burton/Schumacher series, Batman has to have a different love interest? Heeesh, it really just riles me up!!! If this film had had a better director, this could have been my favourite Batman film, but it just didn't work. The villains were just copies of Jack Nicholson's Joker, there's a pointless love interest and Robin's origin story just bored me! There's another thing! If this movie wasn't a take back to the dreaded Adam West Batman, Robin's origin would have been amazing. Robin's origin still hasn't been done to my standards, Dark Knight Rises' attempt was a blatant shove-in! They just said his name was Robin! How was that relevant? I think if Tim Burton had directed this, It would have been quite good but he would probably make the same mistake as Schmacher did and just make it a second-rate version of his first film. He did the same thing in Batman Returns, by ignoring source material and just turning the Penguin into a shorter and more disgusting Joker - Penguin is not a psycho, like Joker, he is a criminal mastermind, a bit like Bane only no where near as strong. Though I think Tim Burton would have cast Johnny Depp as the Riddler and that may have had potential but my ideal cast to make this film so much better would be: Batman - Christian Bale (obviously), although it probably be Keaton, I don't think Bale was old enough at the time of the making of this movie. Two- Face - Harrison Ford Riddler - Neil Patrick Harris/David Tennant And of course, Christopher Nolan should direct! Riddler's objective in this film is a bit ludicrous as well, Riddler wants to get at Batman because he wants to prove that he is more intelligant than the World's Greatest Detective, he doesn't want to take over Gotham! Oh, and he mostly always works alone, so he probably would have killed Two-Face, not asked for his help! The film gets its rating just because the Riddler was in it, though it would have been higher if he was given a better performance. People who will like this: Children under 11, JIm Carrey fans People who won't like this: DC Comics fans, Riddler fans

    Saw this movie about 17 years it was released. Did watch it on video, but this time I had to see it on a big flat TV screen... Thus this movie has flaws, its main theme, which deals from dual personality to full insanity, hits the mark... Jim Carrey totally fly into this movie with all its craziness, Tommy Lee Jones as well, but sad they put Billy Dee Williams aside... Unable to judge if Val Kilmer was a good Bruce Wayne, he was OK to me. Only character which was flawed was Nicole Kidman's as Dr.Chase Meridian. Chris O'Donnell is OK as Robin. In whole, the movie rather goes back to the old Batman series with all the campiness involved. There is a few laughs and a few references to the DC Comics universe... Watch it if you want to spend a good time watching Jim Carrey's antics, he is the show there... Riddle me this...

    Jim Carrey as the riddler was great and Val Kilmer did a pretty good performance as batman, but i don't understand how the great actor Tommy Lee Jones who won an academy award for the fugitive ruined this movie. He laughs almost all the time in the movie and behaves silly when he is with the riddler. according to me this is his worst role ever and it wasn't just the performance, it was the makeup and the clothes to: it was awful and made him look very bizarre rather then a cool scary looking guy which is how the two-face character is all about. This movie could have been great and even good as batman and batman returns if Tommy Lee Jones had done a serious two-face like Aaron Echart in the dark knight. instead it became the beginning of the end of the first batman movie franchise.

    before watching this film you must think to your self ,Im just watching a entertaining pop corn flick because essentially that is what batman forever is as a film.Joel Schumacher brings a completely different type of batman movie ,this film is brighter and more visually appealing in my opinion to the Burton films.Gotham city is covered with tall towers, bright lights and colorful villains this time around .the whole film looks more like a comic book which is a good thing because this film aims to give a more comedic side to batman as his dialog is filled with puns and funny one liners ,even the small smirk in one scene made me feel that this was a much less darker version of batman.however this film has much more batman and not enough Bruce Wayne .Bruce/batman is played by val kilmer who does a good job but never really stands out thanks to a great standout performance from Jim Carey who pretty much saves this film from being a lot worse than it is with his eccentric and over the top personality he was a great casting decision to play riddler .unfortunately the same cannot be said for two face played by tommy lee Jone's who is only given a brief back story in comparison the riddler and is basically just very bland and boring when playing alongside Jim Carey.Nicole kidman is decent as Bruce Wayne's love interest and Chris'o' Donnell looks great as robin .the story in batman forever is mainly centered around how the riddler becomes a villain and the start of the relationship between batman and robin which i feel is a great idea since the previous two films made no attempt to add robin in despite him being a huge part of the comics and the show.i was happy watching Bruce's growing acceptance of having a partner and one scene i like in particular is when robin finds out that Bruce is batman and takes the the bat mobile for a joyride .the scene does a great job of making robins character very likable as we feel as though hes become a kid in a candy store enjoying all of Bruce's toys.besides whats already been mentioned this film did have an extremely silly and over the top plot but it works well since the film tries to go for a comedic and lighter tone .my main complaint is that the films action scenes just could've been a bit better and little things like batman getting sucked into a trap in the opening scene as if hes just a brain dead henchman .the film is an entertaining pop corn flick but by no means one of Batman's best work.

    "Falling Down" director Joel Schumacher replaced Tim Burton on the third live-action Caped Crusader epic "Batman Forever" with Val Kilmer donning the cape and cowl as the Dark Knight with Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey providing the menace. Unfortunately, as awful as the Michael Keaton "Batman" films were, "Batman Forever" qualifies as infinitely worse. This incredibly far-fetched adventure seems less contrived than "Batman" and "Batman Returns," but it suffers primarily from the shoddy screenplay writing skills of Lee Batchler, Janet Scott Batchler , and Akiva Goldsman. Handsome Val Kilmer looks better suited to play the vigilante crime fighter, but his Batman behaves like a complete bimbo. He does so many idiotic things that you just want to throw up your hands in frustration. He allows himself to be trapped early on in a safe bursting with boiling acid. Not long thereafter as millionaire Bruce Wayne, he smashes his way without solicitation into the heroine's apartment because he fears that she is being assaulted. Later, the two villains waltz into Wayne Manor with comparable ease and then invade the Batcave to wreck havoc. Despite all these dreadful mistakes, "Batman Forever" looks much better than its predecessors. "Lethal Weapon" lenser Stephen Goldblatt makes this outing look exceptional and Schumacher maintains a swift pace. Schumacher must have been channeling the 1966 "Batman" because the palette of colors appears brighter and less film noir-like that the Burton "Batman" epics. The production designs of Barbara Ling, Christopher Burian-Mohr and Joseph P. Lucky's art direction, and Ingrid Ferrin & Bob Ringwood's costume designs distinguish this flawed film. One of the biggest problems with "Batman Forever" is that Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey chew the scenery with such maniacal relish that Kilmer's Batman seems hopelessly dull by comparison. One of the few things that Schumacher manages to do with some success is replicate the death of Bruce's parents on a dark street. Since "Batman Forever" is a reboot, virtually all the equipment has been redesigned, such as the Batmobile. This exotic looking car looks like a souped-up sneaker. The Batwing and the Batboat look cool, but they aren't around long. Nevertheless, when the Batwing is blown out of the sky, it takes more than The Joker's well-aimed, .22 caliber long rifle bullet to do the job. The thing that sets this "Batman" outing apart from the two earlier examples is the inclusion of Robin the Boy Wonder. Chris O'Donnell appears almost too old to play the acrobatic Dick Grayson. If you're a Batman fanatic, you know that the death of the Flying Graysons was scrubbed from the first Keaton "Batman" with The Joker responsible for their deaths. The scenarists do a better job with the warped psychological problems that Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson suffer from than the outrageous plot that piles one dumb exploit on top of another. Although it is a comic book opus, "Batman Forever" looks more realistic than the Burton "Batman" movies because the physical sets have a great sense of authenticity.

    1. Billionaires know how to cut costs to maintain their fortress. Beginning with security. 2. Multi-ton safes are no match for one-inch metal-link chains. 3. Why waste your money on a dryer you need, when you can rely on a "Master Dick" to swing clothes around until partially dry like a pro. 4. Where Las Vegas uses this same tactic to attract visitors, Batman is literally trying to scare people off with his Batmobile's armor ofneon. 5. Being trained to fight off dozens of hoodlums doesn't come from The Ninja Academyit begins over a net. With your parents. In the circus. 6. At the rate Bruce is progressively losing brain cells in the original Batman films, it's a wonder they didn't explore his alcoholism over his dead parents. 7. A 25-year-old actor may be able to get away playing a teen, but not one that already looks over 30. 8. "Genius" Edward Nygma spends more than half the movie just deciding on the costume that rests two feet from him. 9. Recently, one of DC Comic's Green Lantern characters was deemed gay. But, Jim Carrey's own green DC Comic book character, The Riddler, actually came out 17 years prior. 10. Amazingly, Director Joel Schumacher didn't just play homage to the campy 1960's TV series; it made Adam West's Batman look deathly serious. 11. Myth: many believe George Clooney killed the bat in Batman & Robin. Fact: Val Kilmer had already put him on life support. 12. Asking your lover an important question and interrupting his answer with a kiss might, in fact, give you that answer. 13. Running out of alley space to escape those expendable villains? There's always the wall to drive up on, regardless of the lack of an exit plan. 14. Backwards thinking: This one should've been called Batman & Robin. 15. In the case of first two movies, or the two that follow, you will learn once again how Bruce became Batman with a flashback down that alley. Thank you; I have such a bad memory. 16. The Bat Signal is a perfect "beeper" for Commissioners, half-burned ex-D.A.'s dressed as the homeless or Australian lingerie models. 17. Actually, anyone can call upon Batman, even if you just wanted to "get drive thru" with him. 18. While it was impressive that the Riddler invented the very first 3-D TV, the only programs to watch were cartoon-rejects andfishing. 19. Two-Face had no idea how lucky he was that Bruce Wayne was in the same audience of fifty when he threatened to bomb the place in order for a spectator to reveal Batman's identity. 20. Even when the movie borderlined a serious topic, it quickly reverted back to the target audience of toddlers. Whew. 21. Alfred's good for two things: making lunch and consistently allowing strangers into the Batcave. 22. Oh, and snarling isn't going to stop a "teenager" from stealing the Batmobile, even if they wrote in the real Batman character in this picture and he thought of, God, any antitheft measures. 23. Further, while cruising Gotham, the Batmobile's hydraulics must come in handy for someone who shouldn't know how to drive the vehicle but can impress older women with the leaps. 24. The budget could've been cut in half if they simply made this live-action cartoon moviea cartoon in the first place. 25. Much like the Spielberg-less Jurassic Park III made us rethink our opinion of The Lost World, Batman Forever caused us to cherish Tim Burton's visions all the more. 26. Tommy Lee Jones channels Jack Nicholson's Joker fairly close as Two-Face, but that's not a positive. Who knew, in the future, Heath Ledger would be the one to reinvent Joker perfectly and Aaron Eckhart would shame Jones as Harvey Dent. 27. Catwoman can kick Chase's ass any day. 28. A decent score, workable cinematography and fantastic soundtrack does not equate a great movie. Otherwise, the middle Twilight films would be top notch. 29. In the future past 1995, Val Kilmer would get fat, Jim Carrey would hit and miss, Chris O'Donnell would, would, waitwho?, Tommy Lee Jones would thrive in black, Nicole Kidman would pass Tom Cruise's baton to future Dark Knight alumni Katie Holmes  who would eventually do the same and sadly, Michael Gough would just pass. But, above all others, thank God, Drew Barrymore would recover.

    This movie marks the start of when things went way wrong with the batman movies, and really this movie will only entertain children the ages of four to six, as I was one of them. Now that I'm much older from when I first saw this movie, I can see how this movie is terrible for most people, and why it's fun for the young kids. It's fun for children because it's a very lighthearted movie that has bright colors, goofy cartoonish villains, and of course you have the dynamic duo in the middle of all of this. Now I don't know if Joel Shumacher has made good movies outside of his batman movies, but judging on this one I'd say that he's probably the worst choice for directing this. Why, is because somehow he made usually great actors give razzie worthy performances, too colorful sets, terrible costumes, and some very cheesy dialogue ( the car right chicks love the car), which is getting way far away from what Batman is supposed to be, in favor of the campy 50's/60's batman of the comic books. Although Val Kilmer is probably not as bad as George Clooney, he still gives a very terrible performance in this, and with what he's working on I can see why. Tommy Lee Jones could have made a great two face, but instead he acts like a fool with bad looking makeup on. Jim Carrey really was only in this I think only to give his career a boost, and comes in way way over the top to the point of annoyance. Nicole Kidman as an original character really has no true purpose to be in the movie aside from the fact that she has to be eye candy for Batman. Chris O' Donnell as Robin spends half of the time whining about how he wants to be Batman's sidekick and kill two face, and probably gives the worst performance of this movie. I didn't find the story interesting at all, and found it to be very boring & stupid. I would rather drink water from a toilet than watch something like this.

    Batman Forever was the highly anticipated third film in the, up until this point hugely successful Batman series. Before Batman Forever Tim Burton had provided us with two absolutely mindblowing and never before seen adaptations of the Dark Knight on film. His dark, Gothic take on the comic book character was a perfect match and because of this Batman was no longer the camp, jokey image of the 60's, but a new true hero for the modern age. The film and it's sequel Batman & Robin are probably the best examples in movie history of what happens when a studio interferes with the creative process in order to make more money. Batman Forever, while still retaining some of the moody imagery of Burton, is a dumbed down, jokey, made for kids adventure that saw the series take a major downturn. The film has very high production values but these are lost in a sea of garish neon colours and odd camera angles. Director Joel Schumacher, a fine director in his own right seems to know absolutely nothing about the characters at all and we are left with a very find cast who seem to be winging it. Val Kilmer replaces the excellent Michael Keaton and to be fair, he has the look and the ability to pull of the character with ease but even he looks lost, unenthusiastic and probably wondering what the hell happened. No one can blame him for accepting the role without reading the script, based on the previous two movies I think anyone would kill to be in that position but it just didn't come off the way anyone expected and he was right not to return. The script is mostly terrible, jam packed full of juvenile humour which completely deflates any of the more serious scenes in the film (Of which there are quite a lot and are reasonably well done). The biggest joke in the film is the villains. Played completely like cartoon characters, there is zero sense of danger from two face and the Riddler. Tommy Lee Jones looks like he's having a real laugh playing two face which has a lot of energy but it is true that he seems to be taking his performance based on Jack Nicholson's Joker and Jim Carey, a man whom I normally love in films and thought was a perfect choice for the role, is just really Ace Ventura in a green suit for the whole film. A shame because I consider Carey a fine actor and would love to have seen that manic side used to portray a truly psychotic and evil version of the character. Instead we get humour of 5 year olds, terrible dialogue and cartoon boing sound effects. The film does have many good points, the cinematography is lush, it's a good length with plenty of other serious sub-plots to keep you interested. Chris O' Donnel excellent as Dick Grayson/Robin and he brings a real sense of seriousness and emotion to the film with his scenes. The big bonus is that Batman Forever provides more screen time to the wonderful Michael Gough who stayed on as butler Alfred from the Burton films. Batman Forever's biggest failing is that it tries to be a part of the world that the Burton films created. Had it been a fresh reboot it might have worked in it's own right. Essentially the filmmakers took what made the previous two films so popular, the moody and bizarre darkness and watered it down to a milky, money making fluid in order to get kids bums on cinema seats and it was pretty obviously done as well. There was a reason why Batman and Batman Returns did so well at the box office and have endured over the years with fans. Batman Forever did exceptionally well also but a lower age rating and a great franchise reputation were almost completely responsible for this success. If you are on a Batman Film binge then 'Forever' is worth tacking on to the end of the first two if you need more, but this is where things started to really go downhill.

    Batman Forever saw Val Kilmar make his debut as the Dark Knight and also a new director as Joel Schumacher comes on board. When Warner Brothers decided to replace director Tim Burton for a more slapstick style for the third installment of the franchise, many wondered if Joel Schumacher would match the award winning Batman Returns. Sadly more question marks surrounded Batman Forever then the latest Riddler outfit. In Batman Returns we had Michelle Pfeiffer in her charismatic role as Catwoman and Danny Devito as the scheming Pengiun. Now we are supplied with a over the top performance from Jim Carrey as he takes the role of the Riddler. Tommy Lee Jones gave a creditable performance as Two-Face although you wonder if he was what character he was playing as on a few occasions he reminded you more of the Joker, although it is fair to say this was probably caused by how the film was scripted rather then a actor's input. If your looking for a non stop action entertainment flick this will not disappoint but for those who are looking for more the same of Burton's earlier work it's best you give this one a miss.

    I am astonished looking at the reviews I'm reading here "reviewing" this movie. hm, more like bashing it. I've never seen a more pompous bunch of self righteous internet morons then the ones you see within the superhero fanboy community, Especially now in aftermath of the Chris Nolan "dark knight" movies (more like Dork knight). I have never seen a series of supposed "superhero" movie's take itself so damn seriously in my life. Did Nolan forget these movies are about a guy in a cape who dresses like a freaking BAT? I mean, yes we have to believe in it to some degree, but there's only so far you can go with trying to "legitimize" a comic book superhero. For crying out loud, he made the batmobile into a tank. A TANK! my Lord, that's the dumbest thing ever. So, here we have Batman Forever, a favorite childhood film of mine that I must have watched a million times on video along with the other 2 batman films. Its a film that does NOT take itself ultra seriously, a visual feast for the eyes and senses. It can indulge in its over the top comic book origins and knows how to have fun with it. People saying batman has to always be dark and beating criminals up to a bloody pulp are ignorant and have not seen or read many comic books, as this film is purposely taking its cue from the 40's and 50's comics which has sillier humorous elements but still were taking itself seriously. This is the BLOCKBUSTER batman that was much needed after the pretty depressing if misunderstood Batman Returns. This was wild summer entertainment in that year of 1995, everything was so great. Jim Carrey was at the top of his game with the ace ventura films, the Mask, dumb and dumber and is a riot as the Riddler. Tommy Lee Jones is a clearly having a blast as two-face, Nicole kidman has never ever been sexier then she is here. Val Kilmer may not be as quirky cool as Michael Keaton, but he looks great in the suit and is very physical, and batman has 2 of them in this movie including the "sonar" suit. Robin is brought in, and done convincingly well, not a corny Burt Ward robin at all. Pity he went from tough vengeful crime fighter to corny goofball in the next one, but here he is as a modern robin should be, tough with a sense of humor and not at all a goofball so its you can take him seriously. Gotham city is vibrant and lit up for the first time, which looks pretty spectacular. Batmans got a host of new rides including a more supped up batmobile with what I always thought was really neat blue lights through the ribbing, as well as a new batboat and batplane. The action scenes are incredible, things like the batmobile climbing up the wall, the bat boat and bat plane riding to claw island, batman and robin running into the bat signal. The iconic moments are there and it makes the film hugely enjoyable. unlike the recent overly serious drivel, this is a comic book film that's not at all afraid of being a comic book film. No attempt to be anything more the an amazing action adventure fantasy and it can be enjoyed by pretty much anyone. I watched this as a kid, loved it then, love it now. Saw the new ones and went what the hell did they do to my favorite superhero? Sad day. The "complaints" that you read about all the time by the nerds are, well, stupid. Yes, stupid. They cry the usual same mantra they have for years, "batnipples!" and "neon!", when the fact is, who REALLY cares about these things when actually watching the film? Do these minor details really destroy the entire film for these unfortunate people? Well, despite the losers down rating this, the fact is the film was hugely successful back in the day and most people still seem to enjoy it, and why not? It a very easy film to watch and its not SO kiddy as to block off all adult watchers. Comic book movies trying to be as realistic and dumb as they have been, I look at it like what a waste. The Batman film's used to be fun, inventive, wild and imaginative, as evidenced in this film. They filled the kid's as well as the adults with a sense of awe and wonder. Now hes a bore, catering to a society that has lost all sense of creativity and imagination. I think they should have stopped at Batman & Robin, because they are not getting any better, only worse.

    It's quite sad for me to watch Batman Forever, because it just doesn't live up to the first Batman film (Tim Burton's successful dark noir). Granted though, it is much better than it's sequel, Batman & Robin. An interesting thing I find is that the film is reasonably well cast; Val Kilmer isn't as awful as Clooney - doesn't really live up to Keaton and definitely not Bale - , Tommy Lee Jones was actually a pretty good casting for Harvey Dent/ Two-Face and Jim Carrey is...alright - he plays himself...again. Though I must talk about the Riddler, he is my all time favourite Batman villain. In the comics and the Arkham games, he is a mysterious man - in fact, he's a bit like Jigsaw from the Saw franchise - and has brilliant dress sense, these are the reasons I love him as a character. In Joel Schumacher's attempt, he is compelety the opposite; he is loud and has no panache, he could be slightly mysterious at times; like when he left all sorts of clues for Bruce, however, even then he started shouting about it. Don't even get me started on his attire - a full body spandex suit, true to the early comics but not the Riddler I fell in love with! Nicole Kidman's part was utterly pointless. Where did Vicki Vale and Selina Kyle disappear off to in the last films? Why is it that in every one of the Burton/Schumacher series, Batman has to have a different love interest? Heeesh, it really just riles me up!!! If this film had had a better director, this could have been my favourite Batman film, but it just didn't work. The villains were just copies of Jack Nicholson's Joker, there's a pointless love interest and Robin's origin story just bored me! There's another thing! If this movie wasn't a take back to the dreaded Adam West Batman, Robin's origin would have been amazing. Robin's origin still hasn't been done to my standards, Dark Knight Rises' attempt was a blatant shove-in! They just said his name was Robin! How was that relevant? I think if Tim Burton had directed this, It would have been quite good but he would probably make the same mistake as Schmacher did and just make it a second-rate version of his first film. He did the same thing in Batman Returns, by ignoring source material and just turning the Penguin into a shorter and more disgusting Joker - Penguin is not a psycho, like Joker, he is a criminal mastermind, a bit like Bane only no where near as strong. Though I think Tim Burton would have cast Johnny Depp as the Riddler and that may have had potential but my ideal cast to make this film so much better would be: Batman - Christian Bale (obviously), although it probably be Keaton, I don't think Bale was old enough at the time of the making of this movie. Two- Face - Harrison Ford Riddler - Neil Patrick Harris/David Tennant And of course, Christopher Nolan should direct! Riddler's objective in this film is a bit ludicrous as well, Riddler wants to get at Batman because he wants to prove that he is more intelligant than the World's Greatest Detective, he doesn't want to take over Gotham! Oh, and he mostly always works alone, so he probably would have killed Two-Face, not asked for his help! The film gets its rating just because the Riddler was in it, though it would have been higher if he was given a better performance. People who will like this: Children under 11, JIm Carrey fans People who won't like this: DC Comics fans, Riddler fans

    Saw this movie about 17 years it was released. Did watch it on video, but this time I had to see it on a big flat TV screen... Thus this movie has flaws, its main theme, which deals from dual personality to full insanity, hits the mark... Jim Carrey totally fly into this movie with all its craziness, Tommy Lee Jones as well, but sad they put Billy Dee Williams aside... Unable to judge if Val Kilmer was a good Bruce Wayne, he was OK to me. Only character which was flawed was Nicole Kidman's as Dr.Chase Meridian. Chris O'Donnell is OK as Robin. In whole, the movie rather goes back to the old Batman series with all the campiness involved. There is a few laughs and a few references to the DC Comics universe... Watch it if you want to spend a good time watching Jim Carrey's antics, he is the show there... Riddle me this...

    Jim Carrey as the riddler was great and Val Kilmer did a pretty good performance as batman, but i don't understand how the great actor Tommy Lee Jones who won an academy award for the fugitive ruined this movie. He laughs almost all the time in the movie and behaves silly when he is with the riddler. according to me this is his worst role ever and it wasn't just the performance, it was the makeup and the clothes to: it was awful and made him look very bizarre rather then a cool scary looking guy which is how the two-face character is all about. This movie could have been great and even good as batman and batman returns if Tommy Lee Jones had done a serious two-face like Aaron Echart in the dark knight. instead it became the beginning of the end of the first batman movie franchise.

    before watching this film you must think to your self ,Im just watching a entertaining pop corn flick because essentially that is what batman forever is as a film.Joel Schumacher brings a completely different type of batman movie ,this film is brighter and more visually appealing in my opinion to the Burton films.Gotham city is covered with tall towers, bright lights and colorful villains this time around .the whole film looks more like a comic book which is a good thing because this film aims to give a more comedic side to batman as his dialog is filled with puns and funny one liners ,even the small smirk in one scene made me feel that this was a much less darker version of batman.however this film has much more batman and not enough Bruce Wayne .Bruce/batman is played by val kilmer who does a good job but never really stands out thanks to a great standout performance from Jim Carey who pretty much saves this film from being a lot worse than it is with his eccentric and over the top personality he was a great casting decision to play riddler .unfortunately the same cannot be said for two face played by tommy lee Jone's who is only given a brief back story in comparison the riddler and is basically just very bland and boring when playing alongside Jim Carey.Nicole kidman is decent as Bruce Wayne's love interest and Chris'o' Donnell looks great as robin .the story in batman forever is mainly centered around how the riddler becomes a villain and the start of the relationship between batman and robin which i feel is a great idea since the previous two films made no attempt to add robin in despite him being a huge part of the comics and the show.i was happy watching Bruce's growing acceptance of having a partner and one scene i like in particular is when robin finds out that Bruce is batman and takes the the bat mobile for a joyride .the scene does a great job of making robins character very likable as we feel as though hes become a kid in a candy store enjoying all of Bruce's toys.besides whats already been mentioned this film did have an extremely silly and over the top plot but it works well since the film tries to go for a comedic and lighter tone .my main complaint is that the films action scenes just could've been a bit better and little things like batman getting sucked into a trap in the opening scene as if hes just a brain dead henchman .the film is an entertaining pop corn flick but by no means one of Batman's best work.

    "Falling Down" director Joel Schumacher replaced Tim Burton on the third live-action Caped Crusader epic "Batman Forever" with Val Kilmer donning the cape and cowl as the Dark Knight with Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey providing the menace. Unfortunately, as awful as the Michael Keaton "Batman" films were, "Batman Forever" qualifies as infinitely worse. This incredibly far-fetched adventure seems less contrived than "Batman" and "Batman Returns," but it suffers primarily from the shoddy screenplay writing skills of Lee Batchler, Janet Scott Batchler , and Akiva Goldsman. Handsome Val Kilmer looks better suited to play the vigilante crime fighter, but his Batman behaves like a complete bimbo. He does so many idiotic things that you just want to throw up your hands in frustration. He allows himself to be trapped early on in a safe bursting with boiling acid. Not long thereafter as millionaire Bruce Wayne, he smashes his way without solicitation into the heroine's apartment because he fears that she is being assaulted. Later, the two villains waltz into Wayne Manor with comparable ease and then invade the Batcave to wreck havoc. Despite all these dreadful mistakes, "Batman Forever" looks much better than its predecessors. "Lethal Weapon" lenser Stephen Goldblatt makes this outing look exceptional and Schumacher maintains a swift pace. Schumacher must have been channeling the 1966 "Batman" because the palette of colors appears brighter and less film noir-like that the Burton "Batman" epics. The production designs of Barbara Ling, Christopher Burian-Mohr and Joseph P. Lucky's art direction, and Ingrid Ferrin & Bob Ringwood's costume designs distinguish this flawed film. One of the biggest problems with "Batman Forever" is that Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey chew the scenery with such maniacal relish that Kilmer's Batman seems hopelessly dull by comparison. One of the few things that Schumacher manages to do with some success is replicate the death of Bruce's parents on a dark street. Since "Batman Forever" is a reboot, virtually all the equipment has been redesigned, such as the Batmobile. This exotic looking car looks like a souped-up sneaker. The Batwing and the Batboat look cool, but they aren't around long. Nevertheless, when the Batwing is blown out of the sky, it takes more than The Joker's well-aimed, .22 caliber long rifle bullet to do the job. The thing that sets this "Batman" outing apart from the two earlier examples is the inclusion of Robin the Boy Wonder. Chris O'Donnell appears almost too old to play the acrobatic Dick Grayson. If you're a Batman fanatic, you know that the death of the Flying Graysons was scrubbed from the first Keaton "Batman" with The Joker responsible for their deaths. The scenarists do a better job with the warped psychological problems that Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson suffer from than the outrageous plot that piles one dumb exploit on top of another. Although it is a comic book opus, "Batman Forever" looks more realistic than the Burton "Batman" movies because the physical sets have a great sense of authenticity.

    1. Billionaires know how to cut costs to maintain their fortress. Beginning with security. 2. Multi-ton safes are no match for one-inch metal-link chains. 3. Why waste your money on a dryer you need, when you can rely on a "Master Dick" to swing clothes around until partially dry like a pro. 4. Where Las Vegas uses this same tactic to attract visitors, Batman is literally trying to scare people off with his Batmobile's armor ofneon. 5. Being trained to fight off dozens of hoodlums doesn't come from The Ninja Academyit begins over a net. With your parents. In the circus. 6. At the rate Bruce is progressively losing brain cells in the original Batman films, it's a wonder they didn't explore his alcoholism over his dead parents. 7. A 25-year-old actor may be able to get away playing a teen, but not one that already looks over 30. 8. "Genius" Edward Nygma spends more than half the movie just deciding on the costume that rests two feet from him. 9. Recently, one of DC Comic's Green Lantern characters was deemed gay. But, Jim Carrey's own green DC Comic book character, The Riddler, actually came out 17 years prior. 10. Amazingly, Director Joel Schumacher didn't just play homage to the campy 1960's TV series; it made Adam West's Batman look deathly serious. 11. Myth: many believe George Clooney killed the bat in Batman & Robin. Fact: Val Kilmer had already put him on life support. 12. Asking your lover an important question and interrupting his answer with a kiss might, in fact, give you that answer. 13. Running out of alley space to escape those expendable villains? There's always the wall to drive up on, regardless of the lack of an exit plan. 14. Backwards thinking: This one should've been called Batman & Robin. 15. In the case of first two movies, or the two that follow, you will learn once again how Bruce became Batman with a flashback down that alley. Thank you; I have such a bad memory. 16. The Bat Signal is a perfect "beeper" for Commissioners, half-burned ex-D.A.'s dressed as the homeless or Australian lingerie models. 17. Actually, anyone can call upon Batman, even if you just wanted to "get drive thru" with him. 18. While it was impressive that the Riddler invented the very first 3-D TV, the only programs to watch were cartoon-rejects andfishing. 19. Two-Face had no idea how lucky he was that Bruce Wayne was in the same audience of fifty when he threatened to bomb the place in order for a spectator to reveal Batman's identity. 20. Even when the movie borderlined a serious topic, it quickly reverted back to the target audience of toddlers. Whew. 21. Alfred's good for two things: making lunch and consistently allowing strangers into the Batcave. 22. Oh, and snarling isn't going to stop a "teenager" from stealing the Batmobile, even if they wrote in the real Batman character in this picture and he thought of, God, any antitheft measures. 23. Further, while cruising Gotham, the Batmobile's hydraulics must come in handy for someone who shouldn't know how to drive the vehicle but can impress older women with the leaps. 24. The budget could've been cut in half if they simply made this live-action cartoon moviea cartoon in the first place. 25. Much like the Spielberg-less Jurassic Park III made us rethink our opinion of The Lost World, Batman Forever caused us to cherish Tim Burton's visions all the more. 26. Tommy Lee Jones channels Jack Nicholson's Joker fairly close as Two-Face, but that's not a positive. Who knew, in the future, Heath Ledger would be the one to reinvent Joker perfectly and Aaron Eckhart would shame Jones as Harvey Dent. 27. Catwoman can kick Chase's ass any day. 28. A decent score, workable cinematography and fantastic soundtrack does not equate a great movie. Otherwise, the middle Twilight films would be top notch. 29. In the future past 1995, Val Kilmer would get fat, Jim Carrey would hit and miss, Chris O'Donnell would, would, waitwho?, Tommy Lee Jones would thrive in black, Nicole Kidman would pass Tom Cruise's baton to future Dark Knight alumni Katie Holmes  who would eventually do the same and sadly, Michael Gough would just pass. But, above all others, thank God, Drew Barrymore would recover.

    This movie marks the start of when things went way wrong with the batman movies, and really this movie will only entertain children the ages of four to six, as I was one of them. Now that I'm much older from when I first saw this movie, I can see how this movie is terrible for most people, and why it's fun for the young kids. It's fun for children because it's a very lighthearted movie that has bright colors, goofy cartoonish villains, and of course you have the dynamic duo in the middle of all of this. Now I don't know if Joel Shumacher has made good movies outside of his batman movies, but judging on this one I'd say that he's probably the worst choice for directing this. Why, is because somehow he made usually great actors give razzie worthy performances, too colorful sets, terrible costumes, and some very cheesy dialogue ( the car right chicks love the car), which is getting way far away from what Batman is supposed to be, in favor of the campy 50's/60's batman of the comic books. Although Val Kilmer is probably not as bad as George Clooney, he still gives a very terrible performance in this, and with what he's working on I can see why. Tommy Lee Jones could have made a great two face, but instead he acts like a fool with bad looking makeup on. Jim Carrey really was only in this I think only to give his career a boost, and comes in way way over the top to the point of annoyance. Nicole Kidman as an original character really has no true purpose to be in the movie aside from the fact that she has to be eye candy for Batman. Chris O' Donnell as Robin spends half of the time whining about how he wants to be Batman's sidekick and kill two face, and probably gives the worst performance of this movie. I didn't find the story interesting at all, and found it to be very boring & stupid. I would rather drink water from a toilet than watch something like this.

    Batman Forever was the highly anticipated third film in the, up until this point hugely successful Batman series. Before Batman Forever Tim Burton had provided us with two absolutely mindblowing and never before seen adaptations of the Dark Knight on film. His dark, Gothic take on the comic book character was a perfect match and because of this Batman was no longer the camp, jokey image of the 60's, but a new true hero for the modern age. The film and it's sequel Batman & Robin are probably the best examples in movie history of what happens when a studio interferes with the creative process in order to make more money. Batman Forever, while still retaining some of the moody imagery of Burton, is a dumbed down, jokey, made for kids adventure that saw the series take a major downturn. The film has very high production values but these are lost in a sea of garish neon colours and odd camera angles. Director Joel Schumacher, a fine director in his own right seems to know absolutely nothing about the characters at all and we are left with a very find cast who seem to be winging it. Val Kilmer replaces the excellent Michael Keaton and to be fair, he has the look and the ability to pull of the character with ease but even he looks lost, unenthusiastic and probably wondering what the hell happened. No one can blame him for accepting the role without reading the script, based on the previous two movies I think anyone would kill to be in that position but it just didn't come off the way anyone expected and he was right not to return. The script is mostly terrible, jam packed full of juvenile humour which completely deflates any of the more serious scenes in the film (Of which there are quite a lot and are reasonably well done). The biggest joke in the film is the villains. Played completely like cartoon characters, there is zero sense of danger from two face and the Riddler. Tommy Lee Jones looks like he's having a real laugh playing two face which has a lot of energy but it is true that he seems to be taking his performance based on Jack Nicholson's Joker and Jim Carey, a man whom I normally love in films and thought was a perfect choice for the role, is just really Ace Ventura in a green suit for the whole film. A shame because I consider Carey a fine actor and would love to have seen that manic side used to portray a truly psychotic and evil version of the character. Instead we get humour of 5 year olds, terrible dialogue and cartoon boing sound effects. The film does have many good points, the cinematography is lush, it's a good length with plenty of other serious sub-plots to keep you interested. Chris O' Donnel excellent as Dick Grayson/Robin and he brings a real sense of seriousness and emotion to the film with his scenes. The big bonus is that Batman Forever provides more screen time to the wonderful Michael Gough who stayed on as butler Alfred from the Burton films. Batman Forever's biggest failing is that it tries to be a part of the world that the Burton films created. Had it been a fresh reboot it might have worked in it's own right. Essentially the filmmakers took what made the previous two films so popular, the moody and bizarre darkness and watered it down to a milky, money making fluid in order to get kids bums on cinema seats and it was pretty obviously done as well. There was a reason why Batman and Batman Returns did so well at the box office and have endured over the years with fans. Batman Forever did exceptionally well also but a lower age rating and a great franchise reputation were almost completely responsible for this success. If you are on a Batman Film binge then 'Forever' is worth tacking on to the end of the first two if you need more, but this is where things started to really go downhill.

If your looking for a non stop action entertainment flick this will not disappoint but for those who are looking for more the same of Burton's earlier work it's best you give this one a miss.

I've never seen a more pompous bunch of self righteous internet morons then the ones you see within the superhero fanboy community, Especially now in aftermath of the Chris Nolan "dark knight" movies (more like Dork knight). I have never seen a series of supposed "superhero" movie's take itself so damn seriously in my life. Did Nolan forget these movies are about a guy in a cape who dresses like a freaking BAT? I mean, yes we have to believe in it to some degree, but there's only so far you can go with trying to "legitimize" a comic book superhero. For crying out loud, he made the batmobile into a tank. A TANK! my Lord, that's the dumbest thing ever. So, here we have Batman Forever, a favorite childhood film of mine that I must have watched a million times on video along with the other 2 batman films. Its a film that does NOT take itself ultra seriously, a visual feast for the eyes and senses. It can indulge in its over the top comic book origins and knows how to have fun with it. People saying batman has to always be dark and beating criminals up to a bloody pulp are ignorant and have not seen or read many comic books, as this film is purposely taking its cue from the 40's and 50's comics which has sillier humorous elements but still were taking itself seriously. This is the BLOCKBUSTER batman that was much needed after the pretty depressing if misunderstood Batman Returns. This was wild summer entertainment in that year of 1995, everything was so great. Jim Carrey was at the top of his game with the ace ventura films, the Mask, dumb and dumber and is a riot as the Riddler. Tommy Lee Jones is a clearly having a blast as two-face, Nicole kidman has never ever been sexier then she is here. Val Kilmer may not be as quirky cool as Michael Keaton, but he looks great in the suit and is very physical, and batman has 2 of them in this movie including the "sonar" suit. Robin is brought in, and done convincingly well, not a corny Burt Ward robin at all. Pity he went from tough vengeful crime fighter to corny goofball in the next one, but here he is as a modern robin should be, tough with a sense of humor and not at all a goofball so its you can take him seriously. Gotham city is vibrant and lit up for the first time, which looks pretty spectacular. Batmans got a host of new rides including a more supped up batmobile with what I always thought was really neat blue lights through the ribbing, as well as a new batboat and batplane. The action scenes are incredible, things like the batmobile climbing up the wall, the bat boat and bat plane riding to claw island, batman and robin running into the bat signal. The iconic moments are there and it makes the film hugely enjoyable. unlike the recent overly serious drivel, this is a comic book film that's not at all afraid of being a comic book film. No attempt to be anything more the an amazing action adventure fantasy and it can be enjoyed by pretty much anyone. I watched this as a kid, loved it then, love it now. Saw the new ones and went what the hell did they do to my favorite superhero? Sad day. The "complaints" that you read about all the time by the nerds are, well, stupid. Yes, stupid. They cry the usual same mantra they have for years, "batnipples!" and "neon!", when the fact is, who REALLY cares about these things when actually watching the film? Do these minor details really destroy the entire film for these unfortunate people? Well, despite the losers down rating this, the fact is the film was hugely successful back in the day and most people still seem to enjoy it, and why not? It a very easy film to watch and its not SO kiddy as to block off all adult watchers. Comic book movies trying to be as realistic and dumb as they have been, I look at it like what a waste. The Batman film's used to be fun, inventive, wild and imaginative, as evidenced in this film. They filled the kid's as well as the adults with a sense of awe and wonder. Now hes a bore, catering to a society that has lost all sense of creativity and imagination. I think they should have stopped at Batman & Robin, because they are not getting any better, only worse.

    It's quite sad for me to watch Batman Forever, because it just doesn't live up to the first Batman film (Tim Burton's successful dark noir). Granted though, it is much better than it's sequel, Batman & Robin. An interesting thing I find is that the film is reasonably well cast; Val Kilmer isn't as awful as Clooney - doesn't really live up to Keaton and definitely not Bale - , Tommy Lee Jones was actually a pretty good casting for Harvey Dent/ Two-Face and Jim Carrey is...alright - he plays himself...again. Though I must talk about the Riddler, he is my all time favourite Batman villain. In the comics and the Arkham games, he is a mysterious man - in fact, he's a bit like Jigsaw from the Saw franchise - and has brilliant dress sense, these are the reasons I love him as a character. In Joel Schumacher's attempt, he is compelety the opposite; he is loud and has no panache, he could be slightly mysterious at times; like when he left all sorts of clues for Bruce, however, even then he started shouting about it. Don't even get me started on his attire - a full body spandex suit, true to the early comics but not the Riddler I fell in love with! Nicole Kidman's part was utterly pointless. Where did Vicki Vale and Selina Kyle disappear off to in the last films? Why is it that in every one of the Burton/Schumacher series, Batman has to have a different love interest? Heeesh, it really just riles me up!!! If this film had had a better director, this could have been my favourite Batman film, but it just didn't work. The villains were just copies of Jack Nicholson's Joker, there's a pointless love interest and Robin's origin story just bored me! There's another thing! If this movie wasn't a take back to the dreaded Adam West Batman, Robin's origin would have been amazing. Robin's origin still hasn't been done to my standards, Dark Knight Rises' attempt was a blatant shove-in! They just said his name was Robin! How was that relevant? I think if Tim Burton had directed this, It would have been quite good but he would probably make the same mistake as Schmacher did and just make it a second-rate version of his first film. He did the same thing in Batman Returns, by ignoring source material and just turning the Penguin into a shorter and more disgusting Joker - Penguin is not a psycho, like Joker, he is a criminal mastermind, a bit like Bane only no where near as strong. Though I think Tim Burton would have cast Johnny Depp as the Riddler and that may have had potential but my ideal cast to make this film so much better would be: Batman - Christian Bale (obviously), although it probably be Keaton, I don't think Bale was old enough at the time of the making of this movie. Two- Face - Harrison Ford Riddler - Neil Patrick Harris/David Tennant And of course, Christopher Nolan should direct! Riddler's objective in this film is a bit ludicrous as well, Riddler wants to get at Batman because he wants to prove that he is more intelligant than the World's Greatest Detective, he doesn't want to take over Gotham! Oh, and he mostly always works alone, so he probably would have killed Two-Face, not asked for his help! The film gets its rating just because the Riddler was in it, though it would have been higher if he was given a better performance. People who will like this: Children under 11, JIm Carrey fans People who won't like this: DC Comics fans, Riddler fans

    Saw this movie about 17 years it was released. Did watch it on video, but this time I had to see it on a big flat TV screen... Thus this movie has flaws, its main theme, which deals from dual personality to full insanity, hits the mark... Jim Carrey totally fly into this movie with all its craziness, Tommy Lee Jones as well, but sad they put Billy Dee Williams aside... Unable to judge if Val Kilmer was a good Bruce Wayne, he was OK to me. Only character which was flawed was Nicole Kidman's as Dr.Chase Meridian. Chris O'Donnell is OK as Robin. In whole, the movie rather goes back to the old Batman series with all the campiness involved. There is a few laughs and a few references to the DC Comics universe... Watch it if you want to spend a good time watching Jim Carrey's antics, he is the show there... Riddle me this...

    Jim Carrey as the riddler was great and Val Kilmer did a pretty good performance as batman, but i don't understand how the great actor Tommy Lee Jones who won an academy award for the fugitive ruined this movie. He laughs almost all the time in the movie and behaves silly when he is with the riddler. according to me this is his worst role ever and it wasn't just the performance, it was the makeup and the clothes to: it was awful and made him look very bizarre rather then a cool scary looking guy which is how the two-face character is all about. This movie could have been great and even good as batman and batman returns if Tommy Lee Jones had done a serious two-face like Aaron Echart in the dark knight. instead it became the beginning of the end of the first batman movie franchise.

    before watching this film you must think to your self ,Im just watching a entertaining pop corn flick because essentially that is what batman forever is as a film.Joel Schumacher brings a completely different type of batman movie ,this film is brighter and more visually appealing in my opinion to the Burton films.Gotham city is covered with tall towers, bright lights and colorful villains this time around .the whole film looks more like a comic book which is a good thing because this film aims to give a more comedic side to batman as his dialog is filled with puns and funny one liners ,even the small smirk in one scene made me feel that this was a much less darker version of batman.however this film has much more batman and not enough Bruce Wayne .Bruce/batman is played by val kilmer who does a good job but never really stands out thanks to a great standout performance from Jim Carey who pretty much saves this film from being a lot worse than it is with his eccentric and over the top personality he was a great casting decision to play riddler .unfortunately the same cannot be said for two face played by tommy lee Jone's who is only given a brief back story in comparison the riddler and is basically just very bland and boring when playing alongside Jim Carey.Nicole kidman is decent as Bruce Wayne's love interest and Chris'o' Donnell looks great as robin .the story in batman forever is mainly centered around how the riddler becomes a villain and the start of the relationship between batman and robin which i feel is a great idea since the previous two films made no attempt to add robin in despite him being a huge part of the comics and the show.i was happy watching Bruce's growing acceptance of having a partner and one scene i like in particular is when robin finds out that Bruce is batman and takes the the bat mobile for a joyride .the scene does a great job of making robins character very likable as we feel as though hes become a kid in a candy store enjoying all of Bruce's toys.besides whats already been mentioned this film did have an extremely silly and over the top plot but it works well since the film tries to go for a comedic and lighter tone .my main complaint is that the films action scenes just could've been a bit better and little things like batman getting sucked into a trap in the opening scene as if hes just a brain dead henchman .the film is an entertaining pop corn flick but by no means one of Batman's best work.

    "Falling Down" director Joel Schumacher replaced Tim Burton on the third live-action Caped Crusader epic "Batman Forever" with Val Kilmer donning the cape and cowl as the Dark Knight with Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey providing the menace. Unfortunately, as awful as the Michael Keaton "Batman" films were, "Batman Forever" qualifies as infinitely worse. This incredibly far-fetched adventure seems less contrived than "Batman" and "Batman Returns," but it suffers primarily from the shoddy screenplay writing skills of Lee Batchler, Janet Scott Batchler , and Akiva Goldsman. Handsome Val Kilmer looks better suited to play the vigilante crime fighter, but his Batman behaves like a complete bimbo. He does so many idiotic things that you just want to throw up your hands in frustration. He allows himself to be trapped early on in a safe bursting with boiling acid. Not long thereafter as millionaire Bruce Wayne, he smashes his way without solicitation into the heroine's apartment because he fears that she is being assaulted. Later, the two villains waltz into Wayne Manor with comparable ease and then invade the Batcave to wreck havoc. Despite all these dreadful mistakes, "Batman Forever" looks much better than its predecessors. "Lethal Weapon" lenser Stephen Goldblatt makes this outing look exceptional and Schumacher maintains a swift pace. Schumacher must have been channeling the 1966 "Batman" because the palette of colors appears brighter and less film noir-like that the Burton "Batman" epics. The production designs of Barbara Ling, Christopher Burian-Mohr and Joseph P. Lucky's art direction, and Ingrid Ferrin & Bob Ringwood's costume designs distinguish this flawed film. One of the biggest problems with "Batman Forever" is that Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey chew the scenery with such maniacal relish that Kilmer's Batman seems hopelessly dull by comparison. One of the few things that Schumacher manages to do with some success is replicate the death of Bruce's parents on a dark street. Since "Batman Forever" is a reboot, virtually all the equipment has been redesigned, such as the Batmobile. This exotic looking car looks like a souped-up sneaker. The Batwing and the Batboat look cool, but they aren't around long. Nevertheless, when the Batwing is blown out of the sky, it takes more than The Joker's well-aimed, .22 caliber long rifle bullet to do the job. The thing that sets this "Batman" outing apart from the two earlier examples is the inclusion of Robin the Boy Wonder. Chris O'Donnell appears almost too old to play the acrobatic Dick Grayson. If you're a Batman fanatic, you know that the death of the Flying Graysons was scrubbed from the first Keaton "Batman" with The Joker responsible for their deaths. The scenarists do a better job with the warped psychological problems that Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson suffer from than the outrageous plot that piles one dumb exploit on top of another. Although it is a comic book opus, "Batman Forever" looks more realistic than the Burton "Batman" movies because the physical sets have a great sense of authenticity.

    1. Billionaires know how to cut costs to maintain their fortress. Beginning with security. 2. Multi-ton safes are no match for one-inch metal-link chains. 3. Why waste your money on a dryer you need, when you can rely on a "Master Dick" to swing clothes around until partially dry like a pro. 4. Where Las Vegas uses this same tactic to attract visitors, Batman is literally trying to scare people off with his Batmobile's armor ofneon. 5. Being trained to fight off dozens of hoodlums doesn't come from The Ninja Academyit begins over a net. With your parents. In the circus. 6. At the rate Bruce is progressively losing brain cells in the original Batman films, it's a wonder they didn't explore his alcoholism over his dead parents. 7. A 25-year-old actor may be able to get away playing a teen, but not one that already looks over 30. 8. "Genius" Edward Nygma spends more than half the movie just deciding on the costume that rests two feet from him. 9. Recently, one of DC Comic's Green Lantern characters was deemed gay. But, Jim Carrey's own green DC Comic book character, The Riddler, actually came out 17 years prior. 10. Amazingly, Director Joel Schumacher didn't just play homage to the campy 1960's TV series; it made Adam West's Batman look deathly serious. 11. Myth: many believe George Clooney killed the bat in Batman & Robin. Fact: Val Kilmer had already put him on life support. 12. Asking your lover an important question and interrupting his answer with a kiss might, in fact, give you that answer. 13. Running out of alley space to escape those expendable villains? There's always the wall to drive up on, regardless of the lack of an exit plan. 14. Backwards thinking: This one should've been called Batman & Robin. 15. In the case of first two movies, or the two that follow, you will learn once again how Bruce became Batman with a flashback down that alley. Thank you; I have such a bad memory. 16. The Bat Signal is a perfect "beeper" for Commissioners, half-burned ex-D.A.'s dressed as the homeless or Australian lingerie models. 17. Actually, anyone can call upon Batman, even if you just wanted to "get drive thru" with him. 18. While it was impressive that the Riddler invented the very first 3-D TV, the only programs to watch were cartoon-rejects andfishing. 19. Two-Face had no idea how lucky he was that Bruce Wayne was in the same audience of fifty when he threatened to bomb the place in order for a spectator to reveal Batman's identity. 20. Even when the movie borderlined a serious topic, it quickly reverted back to the target audience of toddlers. Whew. 21. Alfred's good for two things: making lunch and consistently allowing strangers into the Batcave. 22. Oh, and snarling isn't going to stop a "teenager" from stealing the Batmobile, even if they wrote in the real Batman character in this picture and he thought of, God, any antitheft measures. 23. Further, while cruising Gotham, the Batmobile's hydraulics must come in handy for someone who shouldn't know how to drive the vehicle but can impress older women with the leaps. 24. The budget could've been cut in half if they simply made this live-action cartoon moviea cartoon in the first place. 25. Much like the Spielberg-less Jurassic Park III made us rethink our opinion of The Lost World, Batman Forever caused us to cherish Tim Burton's visions all the more. 26. Tommy Lee Jones channels Jack Nicholson's Joker fairly close as Two-Face, but that's not a positive. Who knew, in the future, Heath Ledger would be the one to reinvent Joker perfectly and Aaron Eckhart would shame Jones as Harvey Dent. 27. Catwoman can kick Chase's ass any day. 28. A decent score, workable cinematography and fantastic soundtrack does not equate a great movie. Otherwise, the middle Twilight films would be top notch. 29. In the future past 1995, Val Kilmer would get fat, Jim Carrey would hit and miss, Chris O'Donnell would, would, waitwho?, Tommy Lee Jones would thrive in black, Nicole Kidman would pass Tom Cruise's baton to future Dark Knight alumni Katie Holmes  who would eventually do the same and sadly, Michael Gough would just pass. But, above all others, thank God, Drew Barrymore would recover.

    This movie marks the start of when things went way wrong with the batman movies, and really this movie will only entertain children the ages of four to six, as I was one of them. Now that I'm much older from when I first saw this movie, I can see how this movie is terrible for most people, and why it's fun for the young kids. It's fun for children because it's a very lighthearted movie that has bright colors, goofy cartoonish villains, and of course you have the dynamic duo in the middle of all of this. Now I don't know if Joel Shumacher has made good movies outside of his batman movies, but judging on this one I'd say that he's probably the worst choice for directing this. Why, is because somehow he made usually great actors give razzie worthy performances, too colorful sets, terrible costumes, and some very cheesy dialogue ( the car right chicks love the car), which is getting way far away from what Batman is supposed to be, in favor of the campy 50's/60's batman of the comic books. Although Val Kilmer is probably not as bad as George Clooney, he still gives a very terrible performance in this, and with what he's working on I can see why. Tommy Lee Jones could have made a great two face, but instead he acts like a fool with bad looking makeup on. Jim Carrey really was only in this I think only to give his career a boost, and comes in way way over the top to the point of annoyance. Nicole Kidman as an original character really has no true purpose to be in the movie aside from the fact that she has to be eye candy for Batman. Chris O' Donnell as Robin spends half of the time whining about how he wants to be Batman's sidekick and kill two face, and probably gives the worst performance of this movie. I didn't find the story interesting at all, and found it to be very boring & stupid. I would rather drink water from a toilet than watch something like this.

    Batman Forever was the highly anticipated third film in the, up until this point hugely successful Batman series. Before Batman Forever Tim Burton had provided us with two absolutely mindblowing and never before seen adaptations of the Dark Knight on film. His dark, Gothic take on the comic book character was a perfect match and because of this Batman was no longer the camp, jokey image of the 60's, but a new true hero for the modern age. The film and it's sequel Batman & Robin are probably the best examples in movie history of what happens when a studio interferes with the creative process in order to make more money. Batman Forever, while still retaining some of the moody imagery of Burton, is a dumbed down, jokey, made for kids adventure that saw the series take a major downturn. The film has very high production values but these are lost in a sea of garish neon colours and odd camera angles. Director Joel Schumacher, a fine director in his own right seems to know absolutely nothing about the characters at all and we are left with a very find cast who seem to be winging it. Val Kilmer replaces the excellent Michael Keaton and to be fair, he has the look and the ability to pull of the character with ease but even he looks lost, unenthusiastic and probably wondering what the hell happened. No one can blame him for accepting the role without reading the script, based on the previous two movies I think anyone would kill to be in that position but it just didn't come off the way anyone expected and he was right not to return. The script is mostly terrible, jam packed full of juvenile humour which completely deflates any of the more serious scenes in the film (Of which there are quite a lot and are reasonably well done). The biggest joke in the film is the villains. Played completely like cartoon characters, there is zero sense of danger from two face and the Riddler. Tommy Lee Jones looks like he's having a real laugh playing two face which has a lot of energy but it is true that he seems to be taking his performance based on Jack Nicholson's Joker and Jim Carey, a man whom I normally love in films and thought was a perfect choice for the role, is just really Ace Ventura in a green suit for the whole film. A shame because I consider Carey a fine actor and would love to have seen that manic side used to portray a truly psychotic and evil version of the character. Instead we get humour of 5 year olds, terrible dialogue and cartoon boing sound effects. The film does have many good points, the cinematography is lush, it's a good length with plenty of other serious sub-plots to keep you interested. Chris O' Donnel excellent as Dick Grayson/Robin and he brings a real sense of seriousness and emotion to the film with his scenes. The big bonus is that Batman Forever provides more screen time to the wonderful Michael Gough who stayed on as butler Alfred from the Burton films. Batman Forever's biggest failing is that it tries to be a part of the world that the Burton films created. Had it been a fresh reboot it might have worked in it's own right. Essentially the filmmakers took what made the previous two films so popular, the moody and bizarre darkness and watered it down to a milky, money making fluid in order to get kids bums on cinema seats and it was pretty obviously done as well. There was a reason why Batman and Batman Returns did so well at the box office and have endured over the years with fans. Batman Forever did exceptionally well also but a lower age rating and a great franchise reputation were almost completely responsible for this success. If you are on a Batman Film binge then 'Forever' is worth tacking on to the end of the first two if you need more, but this is where things started to really go downhill.

    Batman Forever saw Val Kilmar make his debut as the Dark Knight and also a new director as Joel Schumacher comes on board. When Warner Brothers decided to replace director Tim Burton for a more slapstick style for the third installment of the franchise, many wondered if Joel Schumacher would match the award winning Batman Returns. Sadly more question marks surrounded Batman Forever then the latest Riddler outfit. In Batman Returns we had Michelle Pfeiffer in her charismatic role as Catwoman and Danny Devito as the scheming Pengiun. Now we are supplied with a over the top performance from Jim Carrey as he takes the role of the Riddler. Tommy Lee Jones gave a creditable performance as Two-Face although you wonder if he was what character he was playing as on a few occasions he reminded you more of the Joker, although it is fair to say this was probably caused by how the film was scripted rather then a actor's input. If your looking for a non stop action entertainment flick this will not disappoint but for those who are looking for more the same of Burton's earlier work it's best you give this one a miss.

    I am astonished looking at the reviews I'm reading here "reviewing" this movie. hm, more like bashing it. I've never seen a more pompous bunch of self righteous internet morons then the ones you see within the superhero fanboy community, Especially now in aftermath of the Chris Nolan "dark knight" movies (more like Dork knight). I have never seen a series of supposed "superhero" movie's take itself so damn seriously in my life. Did Nolan forget these movies are about a guy in a cape who dresses like a freaking BAT? I mean, yes we have to believe in it to some degree, but there's only so far you can go with trying to "legitimize" a comic book superhero. For crying out loud, he made the batmobile into a tank. A TANK! my Lord, that's the dumbest thing ever. So, here we have Batman Forever, a favorite childhood film of mine that I must have watched a million times on video along with the other 2 batman films. Its a film that does NOT take itself ultra seriously, a visual feast for the eyes and senses. It can indulge in its over the top comic book origins and knows how to have fun with it. People saying batman has to always be dark and beating criminals up to a bloody pulp are ignorant and have not seen or read many comic books, as this film is purposely taking its cue from the 40's and 50's comics which has sillier humorous elements but still were taking itself seriously. This is the BLOCKBUSTER batman that was much needed after the pretty depressing if misunderstood Batman Returns. This was wild summer entertainment in that year of 1995, everything was so great. Jim Carrey was at the top of his game with the ace ventura films, the Mask, dumb and dumber and is a riot as the Riddler. Tommy Lee Jones is a clearly having a blast as two-face, Nicole kidman has never ever been sexier then she is here. Val Kilmer may not be as quirky cool as Michael Keaton, but he looks great in the suit and is very physical, and batman has 2 of them in this movie including the "sonar" suit. Robin is brought in, and done convincingly well, not a corny Burt Ward robin at all. Pity he went from tough vengeful crime fighter to corny goofball in the next one, but here he is as a modern robin should be, tough with a sense of humor and not at all a goofball so its you can take him seriously. Gotham city is vibrant and lit up for the first time, which looks pretty spectacular. Batmans got a host of new rides including a more supped up batmobile with what I always thought was really neat blue lights through the ribbing, as well as a new batboat and batplane. The action scenes are incredible, things like the batmobile climbing up the wall, the bat boat and bat plane riding to claw island, batman and robin running into the bat signal. The iconic moments are there and it makes the film hugely enjoyable. unlike the recent overly serious drivel, this is a comic book film that's not at all afraid of being a comic book film. No attempt to be anything more the an amazing action adventure fantasy and it can be enjoyed by pretty much anyone. I watched this as a kid, loved it then, love it now. Saw the new ones and went what the hell did they do to my favorite superhero? Sad day. The "complaints" that you read about all the time by the nerds are, well, stupid. Yes, stupid. They cry the usual same mantra they have for years, "batnipples!" and "neon!", when the fact is, who REALLY cares about these things when actually watching the film? Do these minor details really destroy the entire film for these unfortunate people? Well, despite the losers down rating this, the fact is the film was hugely successful back in the day and most people still seem to enjoy it, and why not? It a very easy film to watch and its not SO kiddy as to block off all adult watchers. Comic book movies trying to be as realistic and dumb as they have been, I look at it like what a waste. The Batman film's used to be fun, inventive, wild and imaginative, as evidenced in this film. They filled the kid's as well as the adults with a sense of awe and wonder. Now hes a bore, catering to a society that has lost all sense of creativity and imagination. I think they should have stopped at Batman & Robin, because they are not getting any better, only worse.

    It's quite sad for me to watch Batman Forever, because it just doesn't live up to the first Batman film (Tim Burton's successful dark noir). Granted though, it is much better than it's sequel, Batman & Robin. An interesting thing I find is that the film is reasonably well cast; Val Kilmer isn't as awful as Clooney - doesn't really live up to Keaton and definitely not Bale - , Tommy Lee Jones was actually a pretty good casting for Harvey Dent/ Two-Face and Jim Carrey is...alright - he plays himself...again. Though I must talk about the Riddler, he is my all time favourite Batman villain. In the comics and the Arkham games, he is a mysterious man - in fact, he's a bit like Jigsaw from the Saw franchise - and has brilliant dress sense, these are the reasons I love him as a character. In Joel Schumacher's attempt, he is compelety the opposite; he is loud and has no panache, he could be slightly mysterious at times; like when he left all sorts of clues for Bruce, however, even then he started shouting about it. Don't even get me started on his attire - a full body spandex suit, true to the early comics but not the Riddler I fell in love with! Nicole Kidman's part was utterly pointless. Where did Vicki Vale and Selina Kyle disappear off to in the last films? Why is it that in every one of the Burton/Schumacher series, Batman has to have a different love interest? Heeesh, it really just riles me up!!! If this film had had a better director, this could have been my favourite Batman film, but it just didn't work. The villains were just copies of Jack Nicholson's Joker, there's a pointless love interest and Robin's origin story just bored me! There's another thing! If this movie wasn't a take back to the dreaded Adam West Batman, Robin's origin would have been amazing. Robin's origin still hasn't been done to my standards, Dark Knight Rises' attempt was a blatant shove-in! They just said his name was Robin! How was that relevant? I think if Tim Burton had directed this, It would have been quite good but he would probably make the same mistake as Schmacher did and just make it a second-rate version of his first film. He did the same thing in Batman Returns, by ignoring source material and just turning the Penguin into a shorter and more disgusting Joker - Penguin is not a psycho, like Joker, he is a criminal mastermind, a bit like Bane only no where near as strong. Though I think Tim Burton would have cast Johnny Depp as the Riddler and that may have had potential but my ideal cast to make this film so much better would be: Batman - Christian Bale (obviously), although it probably be Keaton, I don't think Bale was old enough at the time of the making of this movie. Two- Face - Harrison Ford Riddler - Neil Patrick Harris/David Tennant And of course, Christopher Nolan should direct! Riddler's objective in this film is a bit ludicrous as well, Riddler wants to get at Batman because he wants to prove that he is more intelligant than the World's Greatest Detective, he doesn't want to take over Gotham! Oh, and he mostly always works alone, so he probably would have killed Two-Face, not asked for his help! The film gets its rating just because the Riddler was in it, though it would have been higher if he was given a better performance. People who will like this: Children under 11, JIm Carrey fans People who won't like this: DC Comics fans, Riddler fans

    Saw this movie about 17 years it was released. Did watch it on video, but this time I had to see it on a big flat TV screen... Thus this movie has flaws, its main theme, which deals from dual personality to full insanity, hits the mark... Jim Carrey totally fly into this movie with all its craziness, Tommy Lee Jones as well, but sad they put Billy Dee Williams aside... Unable to judge if Val Kilmer was a good Bruce Wayne, he was OK to me. Only character which was flawed was Nicole Kidman's as Dr.Chase Meridian. Chris O'Donnell is OK as Robin. In whole, the movie rather goes back to the old Batman series with all the campiness involved. There is a few laughs and a few references to the DC Comics universe... Watch it if you want to spend a good time watching Jim Carrey's antics, he is the show there... Riddle me this...

    Jim Carrey as the riddler was great and Val Kilmer did a pretty good performance as batman, but i don't understand how the great actor Tommy Lee Jones who won an academy award for the fugitive ruined this movie. He laughs almost all the time in the movie and behaves silly when he is with the riddler. according to me this is his worst role ever and it wasn't just the performance, it was the makeup and the clothes to: it was awful and made him look very bizarre rather then a cool scary looking guy which is how the two-face character is all about. This movie could have been great and even good as batman and batman returns if Tommy Lee Jones had done a serious two-face like Aaron Echart in the dark knight. instead it became the beginning of the end of the first batman movie franchise.

    before watching this film you must think to your self ,Im just watching a entertaining pop corn flick because essentially that is what batman forever is as a film.Joel Schumacher brings a completely different type of batman movie ,this film is brighter and more visually appealing in my opinion to the Burton films.Gotham city is covered with tall towers, bright lights and colorful villains this time around .the whole film looks more like a comic book which is a good thing because this film aims to give a more comedic side to batman as his dialog is filled with puns and funny one liners ,even the small smirk in one scene made me feel that this was a much less darker version of batman.however this film has much more batman and not enough Bruce Wayne .Bruce/batman is played by val kilmer who does a good job but never really stands out thanks to a great standout performance from Jim Carey who pretty much saves this film from being a lot worse than it is with his eccentric and over the top personality he was a great casting decision to play riddler .unfortunately the same cannot be said for two face played by tommy lee Jone's who is only given a brief back story in comparison the riddler and is basically just very bland and boring when playing alongside Jim Carey.Nicole kidman is decent as Bruce Wayne's love interest and Chris'o' Donnell looks great as robin .the story in batman forever is mainly centered around how the riddler becomes a villain and the start of the relationship between batman and robin which i feel is a great idea since the previous two films made no attempt to add robin in despite him being a huge part of the comics and the show.i was happy watching Bruce's growing acceptance of having a partner and one scene i like in particular is when robin finds out that Bruce is batman and takes the the bat mobile for a joyride .the scene does a great job of making robins character very likable as we feel as though hes become a kid in a candy store enjoying all of Bruce's toys.besides whats already been mentioned this film did have an extremely silly and over the top plot but it works well since the film tries to go for a comedic and lighter tone .my main complaint is that the films action scenes just could've been a bit better and little things like batman getting sucked into a trap in the opening scene as if hes just a brain dead henchman .the film is an entertaining pop corn flick but by no means one of Batman's best work.

    "Falling Down" director Joel Schumacher replaced Tim Burton on the third live-action Caped Crusader epic "Batman Forever" with Val Kilmer donning the cape and cowl as the Dark Knight with Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey providing the menace. Unfortunately, as awful as the Michael Keaton "Batman" films were, "Batman Forever" qualifies as infinitely worse. This incredibly far-fetched adventure seems less contrived than "Batman" and "Batman Returns," but it suffers primarily from the shoddy screenplay writing skills of Lee Batchler, Janet Scott Batchler , and Akiva Goldsman. Handsome Val Kilmer looks better suited to play the vigilante crime fighter, but his Batman behaves like a complete bimbo. He does so many idiotic things that you just want to throw up your hands in frustration. He allows himself to be trapped early on in a safe bursting with boiling acid. Not long thereafter as millionaire Bruce Wayne, he smashes his way without solicitation into the heroine's apartment because he fears that she is being assaulted. Later, the two villains waltz into Wayne Manor with comparable ease and then invade the Batcave to wreck havoc. Despite all these dreadful mistakes, "Batman Forever" looks much better than its predecessors. "Lethal Weapon" lenser Stephen Goldblatt makes this outing look exceptional and Schumacher maintains a swift pace. Schumacher must have been channeling the 1966 "Batman" because the palette of colors appears brighter and less film noir-like that the Burton "Batman" epics. The production designs of Barbara Ling, Christopher Burian-Mohr and Joseph P. Lucky's art direction, and Ingrid Ferrin & Bob Ringwood's costume designs distinguish this flawed film. One of the biggest problems with "Batman Forever" is that Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey chew the scenery with such maniacal relish that Kilmer's Batman seems hopelessly dull by comparison. One of the few things that Schumacher manages to do with some success is replicate the death of Bruce's parents on a dark street. Since "Batman Forever" is a reboot, virtually all the equipment has been redesigned, such as the Batmobile. This exotic looking car looks like a souped-up sneaker. The Batwing and the Batboat look cool, but they aren't around long. Nevertheless, when the Batwing is blown out of the sky, it takes more than The Joker's well-aimed, .22 caliber long rifle bullet to do the job. The thing that sets this "Batman" outing apart from the two earlier examples is the inclusion of Robin the Boy Wonder. Chris O'Donnell appears almost too old to play the acrobatic Dick Grayson. If you're a Batman fanatic, you know that the death of the Flying Graysons was scrubbed from the first Keaton "Batman" with The Joker responsible for their deaths. The scenarists do a better job with the warped psychological problems that Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson suffer from than the outrageous plot that piles one dumb exploit on top of another. Although it is a comic book opus, "Batman Forever" looks more realistic than the Burton "Batman" movies because the physical sets have a great sense of authenticity.

    1. Billionaires know how to cut costs to maintain their fortress. Beginning with security. 2. Multi-ton safes are no match for one-inch metal-link chains. 3. Why waste your money on a dryer you need, when you can rely on a "Master Dick" to swing clothes around until partially dry like a pro. 4. Where Las Vegas uses this same tactic to attract visitors, Batman is literally trying to scare people off with his Batmobile's armor ofneon. 5. Being trained to fight off dozens of hoodlums doesn't come from The Ninja Academyit begins over a net. With your parents. In the circus. 6. At the rate Bruce is progressively losing brain cells in the original Batman films, it's a wonder they didn't explore his alcoholism over his dead parents. 7. A 25-year-old actor may be able to get away playing a teen, but not one that already looks over 30. 8. "Genius" Edward Nygma spends more than half the movie just deciding on the costume that rests two feet from him. 9. Recently, one of DC Comic's Green Lantern characters was deemed gay. But, Jim Carrey's own green DC Comic book character, The Riddler, actually came out 17 years prior. 10. Amazingly, Director Joel Schumacher didn't just play homage to the campy 1960's TV series; it made Adam West's Batman look deathly serious. 11. Myth: many believe George Clooney killed the bat in Batman & Robin. Fact: Val Kilmer had already put him on life support. 12. Asking your lover an important question and interrupting his answer with a kiss might, in fact, give you that answer. 13. Running out of alley space to escape those expendable villains? There's always the wall to drive up on, regardless of the lack of an exit plan. 14. Backwards thinking: This one should've been called Batman & Robin. 15. In the case of first two movies, or the two that follow, you will learn once again how Bruce became Batman with a flashback down that alley. Thank you; I have such a bad memory. 16. The Bat Signal is a perfect "beeper" for Commissioners, half-burned ex-D.A.'s dressed as the homeless or Australian lingerie models. 17. Actually, anyone can call upon Batman, even if you just wanted to "get drive thru" with him. 18. While it was impressive that the Riddler invented the very first 3-D TV, the only programs to watch were cartoon-rejects andfishing. 19. Two-Face had no idea how lucky he was that Bruce Wayne was in the same audience of fifty when he threatened to bomb the place in order for a spectator to reveal Batman's identity. 20. Even when the movie borderlined a serious topic, it quickly reverted back to the target audience of toddlers. Whew. 21. Alfred's good for two things: making lunch and consistently allowing strangers into the Batcave. 22. Oh, and snarling isn't going to stop a "teenager" from stealing the Batmobile, even if they wrote in the real Batman character in this picture and he thought of, God, any antitheft measures. 23. Further, while cruising Gotham, the Batmobile's hydraulics must come in handy for someone who shouldn't know how to drive the vehicle but can impress older women with the leaps. 24. The budget could've been cut in half if they simply made this live-action cartoon moviea cartoon in the first place. 25. Much like the Spielberg-less Jurassic Park III made us rethink our opinion of The Lost World, Batman Forever caused us to cherish Tim Burton's visions all the more. 26. Tommy Lee Jones channels Jack Nicholson's Joker fairly close as Two-Face, but that's not a positive. Who knew, in the future, Heath Ledger would be the one to reinvent Joker perfectly and Aaron Eckhart would shame Jones as Harvey Dent. 27. Catwoman can kick Chase's ass any day. 28. A decent score, workable cinematography and fantastic soundtrack does not equate a great movie. Otherwise, the middle Twilight films would be top notch. 29. In the future past 1995, Val Kilmer would get fat, Jim Carrey would hit and miss, Chris O'Donnell would, would, waitwho?, Tommy Lee Jones would thrive in black, Nicole Kidman would pass Tom Cruise's baton to future Dark Knight alumni Katie Holmes  who would eventually do the same and sadly, Michael Gough would just pass. But, above all others, thank God, Drew Barrymore would recover.

    This movie marks the start of when things went way wrong with the batman movies, and really this movie will only entertain children the ages of four to six, as I was one of them. Now that I'm much older from when I first saw this movie, I can see how this movie is terrible for most people, and why it's fun for the young kids. It's fun for children because it's a very lighthearted movie that has bright colors, goofy cartoonish villains, and of course you have the dynamic duo in the middle of all of this. Now I don't know if Joel Shumacher has made good movies outside of his batman movies, but judging on this one I'd say that he's probably the worst choice for directing this. Why, is because somehow he made usually great actors give razzie worthy performances, too colorful sets, terrible costumes, and some very cheesy dialogue ( the car right chicks love the car), which is getting way far away from what Batman is supposed to be, in favor of the campy 50's/60's batman of the comic books. Although Val Kilmer is probably not as bad as George Clooney, he still gives a very terrible performance in this, and with what he's working on I can see why. Tommy Lee Jones could have made a great two face, but instead he acts like a fool with bad looking makeup on. Jim Carrey really was only in this I think only to give his career a boost, and comes in way way over the top to the point of annoyance. Nicole Kidman as an original character really has no true purpose to be in the movie aside from the fact that she has to be eye candy for Batman. Chris O' Donnell as Robin spends half of the time whining about how he wants to be Batman's sidekick and kill two face, and probably gives the worst performance of this movie. I didn't find the story interesting at all, and found it to be very boring & stupid. I would rather drink water from a toilet than watch something like this.

    Batman Forever was the highly anticipated third film in the, up until this point hugely successful Batman series. Before Batman Forever Tim Burton had provided us with two absolutely mindblowing and never before seen adaptations of the Dark Knight on film. His dark, Gothic take on the comic book character was a perfect match and because of this Batman was no longer the camp, jokey image of the 60's, but a new true hero for the modern age. The film and it's sequel Batman & Robin are probably the best examples in movie history of what happens when a studio interferes with the creative process in order to make more money. Batman Forever, while still retaining some of the moody imagery of Burton, is a dumbed down, jokey, made for kids adventure that saw the series take a major downturn. The film has very high production values but these are lost in a sea of garish neon colours and odd camera angles. Director Joel Schumacher, a fine director in his own right seems to know absolutely nothing about the characters at all and we are left with a very find cast who seem to be winging it. Val Kilmer replaces the excellent Michael Keaton and to be fair, he has the look and the ability to pull of the character with ease but even he looks lost, unenthusiastic and probably wondering what the hell happened. No one can blame him for accepting the role without reading the script, based on the previous two movies I think anyone would kill to be in that position but it just didn't come off the way anyone expected and he was right not to return. The script is mostly terrible, jam packed full of juvenile humour which completely deflates any of the more serious scenes in the film (Of which there are quite a lot and are reasonably well done). The biggest joke in the film is the villains. Played completely like cartoon characters, there is zero sense of danger from two face and the Riddler. Tommy Lee Jones looks like he's having a real laugh playing two face which has a lot of energy but it is true that he seems to be taking his performance based on Jack Nicholson's Joker and Jim Carey, a man whom I normally love in films and thought was a perfect choice for the role, is just really Ace Ventura in a green suit for the whole film. A shame because I consider Carey a fine actor and would love to have seen that manic side used to portray a truly psychotic and evil version of the character. Instead we get humour of 5 year olds, terrible dialogue and cartoon boing sound effects. The film does have many good points, the cinematography is lush, it's a good length with plenty of other serious sub-plots to keep you interested. Chris O' Donnel excellent as Dick Grayson/Robin and he brings a real sense of seriousness and emotion to the film with his scenes. The big bonus is that Batman Forever provides more screen time to the wonderful Michael Gough who stayed on as butler Alfred from the Burton films. Batman Forever's biggest failing is that it tries to be a part of the world that the Burton films created. Had it been a fresh reboot it might have worked in it's own right. Essentially the filmmakers took what made the previous two films so popular, the moody and bizarre darkness and watered it down to a milky, money making fluid in order to get kids bums on cinema seats and it was pretty obviously done as well. There was a reason why Batman and Batman Returns did so well at the box office and have endured over the years with fans. Batman Forever did exceptionally well also but a lower age rating and a great franchise reputation were almost completely responsible for this success. If you are on a Batman Film binge then 'Forever' is worth tacking on to the end of the first two if you need more, but this is where things started to really go downhill.

    Batman Forever saw Val Kilmar make his debut as the Dark Knight and also a new director as Joel Schumacher comes on board. When Warner Brothers decided to replace director Tim Burton for a more slapstick style for the third installment of the franchise, many wondered if Joel Schumacher would match the award winning Batman Returns. Sadly more question marks surrounded Batman Forever then the latest Riddler outfit. In Batman Returns we had Michelle Pfeiffer in her charismatic role as Catwoman and Danny Devito as the scheming Pengiun. Now we are supplied with a over the top performance from Jim Carrey as he takes the role of the Riddler. Tommy Lee Jones gave a creditable performance as Two-Face although you wonder if he was what character he was playing as on a few occasions he reminded you more of the Joker, although it is fair to say this was probably caused by how the film was scripted rather then a actor's input. If your looking for a non stop action entertainment flick this will not disappoint but for those who are looking for more the same of Burton's earlier work it's best you give this one a miss.

    I am astonished looking at the reviews I'm reading here "reviewing" this movie. hm, more like bashing it. I've never seen a more pompous bunch of self righteous internet morons then the ones you see within the superhero fanboy community, Especially now in aftermath of the Chris Nolan "dark knight" movies (more like Dork knight). I have never seen a series of supposed "superhero" movie's take itself so damn seriously in my life. Did Nolan forget these movies are about a guy in a cape who dresses like a freaking BAT? I mean, yes we have to believe in it to some degree, but there's only so far you can go with trying to "legitimize" a comic book superhero. For crying out loud, he made the batmobile into a tank. A TANK! my Lord, that's the dumbest thing ever. So, here we have Batman Forever, a favorite childhood film of mine that I must have watched a million times on video along with the other 2 batman films. Its a film that does NOT take itself ultra seriously, a visual feast for the eyes and senses. It can indulge in its over the top comic book origins and knows how to have fun with it. People saying batman has to always be dark and beating criminals up to a bloody pulp are ignorant and have not seen or read many comic books, as this film is purposely taking its cue from the 40's and 50's comics which has sillier humorous elements but still were taking itself seriously. This is the BLOCKBUSTER batman that was much needed after the pretty depressing if misunderstood Batman Returns. This was wild summer entertainment in that year of 1995, everything was so great. Jim Carrey was at the top of his game with the ace ventura films, the Mask, dumb and dumber and is a riot as the Riddler. Tommy Lee Jones is a clearly having a blast as two-face, Nicole kidman has never ever been sexier then she is here. Val Kilmer may not be as quirky cool as Michael Keaton, but he looks great in the suit and is very physical, and batman has 2 of them in this movie including the "sonar" suit. Robin is brought in, and done convincingly well, not a corny Burt Ward robin at all. Pity he went from tough vengeful crime fighter to corny goofball in the next one, but here he is as a modern robin should be, tough with a sense of humor and not at all a goofball so its you can take him seriously. Gotham city is vibrant and lit up for the first time, which looks pretty spectacular. Batmans got a host of new rides including a more supped up batmobile with what I always thought was really neat blue lights through the ribbing, as well as a new batboat and batplane. The action scenes are incredible, things like the batmobile climbing up the wall, the bat boat and bat plane riding to claw island, batman and robin running into the bat signal. The iconic moments are there and it makes the film hugely enjoyable. unlike the recent overly serious drivel, this is a comic book film that's not at all afraid of being a comic book film. No attempt to be anything more the an amazing action adventure fantasy and it can be enjoyed by pretty much anyone. I watched this as a kid, loved it then, love it now. Saw the new ones and went what the hell did they do to my favorite superhero? Sad day. The "complaints" that you read about all the time by the nerds are, well, stupid. Yes, stupid. They cry the usual same mantra they have for years, "batnipples!" and "neon!", when the fact is, who REALLY cares about these things when actually watching the film? Do these minor details really destroy the entire film for these unfortunate people? Well, despite the losers down rating this, the fact is the film was hugely successful back in the day and most people still seem to enjoy it, and why not? It a very easy film to watch and its not SO kiddy as to block off all adult watchers. Comic book movies trying to be as realistic and dumb as they have been, I look at it like what a waste. The Batman film's used to be fun, inventive, wild and imaginative, as evidenced in this film. They filled the kid's as well as the adults with a sense of awe and wonder. Now hes a bore, catering to a society that has lost all sense of creativity and imagination. I think they should have stopped at Batman & Robin, because they are not getting any better, only worse.

    It's quite sad for me to watch Batman Forever, because it just doesn't live up to the first Batman film (Tim Burton's successful dark noir). Granted though, it is much better than it's sequel, Batman & Robin. An interesting thing I find is that the film is reasonably well cast; Val Kilmer isn't as awful as Clooney - doesn't really live up to Keaton and definitely not Bale - , Tommy Lee Jones was actually a pretty good casting for Harvey Dent/ Two-Face and Jim Carrey is...alright - he plays himself...again. Though I must talk about the Riddler, he is my all time favourite Batman villain. In the comics and the Arkham games, he is a mysterious man - in fact, he's a bit like Jigsaw from the Saw franchise - and has brilliant dress sense, these are the reasons I love him as a character. In Joel Schumacher's attempt, he is compelety the opposite; he is loud and has no panache, he could be slightly mysterious at times; like when he left all sorts of clues for Bruce, however, even then he started shouting about it. Don't even get me started on his attire - a full body spandex suit, true to the early comics but not the Riddler I fell in love with! Nicole Kidman's part was utterly pointless. Where did Vicki Vale and Selina Kyle disappear off to in the last films? Why is it that in every one of the Burton/Schumacher series, Batman has to have a different love interest? Heeesh, it really just riles me up!!! If this film had had a better director, this could have been my favourite Batman film, but it just didn't work. The villains were just copies of Jack Nicholson's Joker, there's a pointless love interest and Robin's origin story just bored me! There's another thing! If this movie wasn't a take back to the dreaded Adam West Batman, Robin's origin would have been amazing. Robin's origin still hasn't been done to my standards, Dark Knight Rises' attempt was a blatant shove-in! They just said his name was Robin! How was that relevant? I think if Tim Burton had directed this, It would have been quite good but he would probably make the same mistake as Schmacher did and just make it a second-rate version of his first film. He did the same thing in Batman Returns, by ignoring source material and just turning the Penguin into a shorter and more disgusting Joker - Penguin is not a psycho, like Joker, he is a criminal mastermind, a bit like Bane only no where near as strong. Though I think Tim Burton would have cast Johnny Depp as the Riddler and that may have had potential but my ideal cast to make this film so much better would be: Batman - Christian Bale (obviously), although it probably be Keaton, I don't think Bale was old enough at the time of the making of this movie. Two- Face - Harrison Ford Riddler - Neil Patrick Harris/David Tennant And of course, Christopher Nolan should direct! Riddler's objective in this film is a bit ludicrous as well, Riddler wants to get at Batman because he wants to prove that he is more intelligant than the World's Greatest Detective, he doesn't want to take over Gotham! Oh, and he mostly always works alone, so he probably would have killed Two-Face, not asked for his help! The film gets its rating just because the Riddler was in it, though it would have been higher if he was given a better performance. People who will like this: Children under 11, JIm Carrey fans People who won't like this: DC Comics fans, Riddler fans

Jim Carrey totally fly into this movie with all its craziness, Tommy Lee Jones as well, but sad they put Billy Dee Williams aside... Unable to judge if Val Kilmer was a good Bruce Wayne, he was OK to me. Only character which was flawed was Nicole Kidman's as Dr.Chase Meridian. Chris O'Donnell is OK as Robin. In whole, the movie rather goes back to the old Batman series with all the campiness involved. There is a few laughs and a few references to the DC Comics universe... Watch it if you want to spend a good time watching Jim Carrey's antics, he is the show there... Riddle me this...

    Jim Carrey as the riddler was great and Val Kilmer did a pretty good performance as batman, but i don't understand how the great actor Tommy Lee Jones who won an academy award for the fugitive ruined this movie. He laughs almost all the time in the movie and behaves silly when he is with the riddler. according to me this is his worst role ever and it wasn't just the performance, it was the makeup and the clothes to: it was awful and made him look very bizarre rather then a cool scary looking guy which is how the two-face character is all about. This movie could have been great and even good as batman and batman returns if Tommy Lee Jones had done a serious two-face like Aaron Echart in the dark knight. instead it became the beginning of the end of the first batman movie franchise.

    before watching this film you must think to your self ,Im just watching a entertaining pop corn flick because essentially that is what batman forever is as a film.Joel Schumacher brings a completely different type of batman movie ,this film is brighter and more visually appealing in my opinion to the Burton films.Gotham city is covered with tall towers, bright lights and colorful villains this time around .the whole film looks more like a comic book which is a good thing because this film aims to give a more comedic side to batman as his dialog is filled with puns and funny one liners ,even the small smirk in one scene made me feel that this was a much less darker version of batman.however this film has much more batman and not enough Bruce Wayne .Bruce/batman is played by val kilmer who does a good job but never really stands out thanks to a great standout performance from Jim Carey who pretty much saves this film from being a lot worse than it is with his eccentric and over the top personality he was a great casting decision to play riddler .unfortunately the same cannot be said for two face played by tommy lee Jone's who is only given a brief back story in comparison the riddler and is basically just very bland and boring when playing alongside Jim Carey.Nicole kidman is decent as Bruce Wayne's love interest and Chris'o' Donnell looks great as robin .the story in batman forever is mainly centered around how the riddler becomes a villain and the start of the relationship between batman and robin which i feel is a great idea since the previous two films made no attempt to add robin in despite him being a huge part of the comics and the show.i was happy watching Bruce's growing acceptance of having a partner and one scene i like in particular is when robin finds out that Bruce is batman and takes the the bat mobile for a joyride .the scene does a great job of making robins character very likable as we feel as though hes become a kid in a candy store enjoying all of Bruce's toys.besides whats already been mentioned this film did have an extremely silly and over the top plot but it works well since the film tries to go for a comedic and lighter tone .my main complaint is that the films action scenes just could've been a bit better and little things like batman getting sucked into a trap in the opening scene as if hes just a brain dead henchman .the film is an entertaining pop corn flick but by no means one of Batman's best work.

    "Falling Down" director Joel Schumacher replaced Tim Burton on the third live-action Caped Crusader epic "Batman Forever" with Val Kilmer donning the cape and cowl as the Dark Knight with Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey providing the menace. Unfortunately, as awful as the Michael Keaton "Batman" films were, "Batman Forever" qualifies as infinitely worse. This incredibly far-fetched adventure seems less contrived than "Batman" and "Batman Returns," but it suffers primarily from the shoddy screenplay writing skills of Lee Batchler, Janet Scott Batchler , and Akiva Goldsman. Handsome Val Kilmer looks better suited to play the vigilante crime fighter, but his Batman behaves like a complete bimbo. He does so many idiotic things that you just want to throw up your hands in frustration. He allows himself to be trapped early on in a safe bursting with boiling acid. Not long thereafter as millionaire Bruce Wayne, he smashes his way without solicitation into the heroine's apartment because he fears that she is being assaulted. Later, the two villains waltz into Wayne Manor with comparable ease and then invade the Batcave to wreck havoc. Despite all these dreadful mistakes, "Batman Forever" looks much better than its predecessors. "Lethal Weapon" lenser Stephen Goldblatt makes this outing look exceptional and Schumacher maintains a swift pace. Schumacher must have been channeling the 1966 "Batman" because the palette of colors appears brighter and less film noir-like that the Burton "Batman" epics. The production designs of Barbara Ling, Christopher Burian-Mohr and Joseph P. Lucky's art direction, and Ingrid Ferrin & Bob Ringwood's costume designs distinguish this flawed film. One of the biggest problems with "Batman Forever" is that Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey chew the scenery with such maniacal relish that Kilmer's Batman seems hopelessly dull by comparison. One of the few things that Schumacher manages to do with some success is replicate the death of Bruce's parents on a dark street. Since "Batman Forever" is a reboot, virtually all the equipment has been redesigned, such as the Batmobile. This exotic looking car looks like a souped-up sneaker. The Batwing and the Batboat look cool, but they aren't around long. Nevertheless, when the Batwing is blown out of the sky, it takes more than The Joker's well-aimed, .22 caliber long rifle bullet to do the job. The thing that sets this "Batman" outing apart from the two earlier examples is the inclusion of Robin the Boy Wonder. Chris O'Donnell appears almost too old to play the acrobatic Dick Grayson. If you're a Batman fanatic, you know that the death of the Flying Graysons was scrubbed from the first Keaton "Batman" with The Joker responsible for their deaths. The scenarists do a better job with the warped psychological problems that Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson suffer from than the outrageous plot that piles one dumb exploit on top of another. Although it is a comic book opus, "Batman Forever" looks more realistic than the Burton "Batman" movies because the physical sets have a great sense of authenticity.

    1. Billionaires know how to cut costs to maintain their fortress. Beginning with security. 2. Multi-ton safes are no match for one-inch metal-link chains. 3. Why waste your money on a dryer you need, when you can rely on a "Master Dick" to swing clothes around until partially dry like a pro. 4. Where Las Vegas uses this same tactic to attract visitors, Batman is literally trying to scare people off with his Batmobile's armor ofneon. 5. Being trained to fight off dozens of hoodlums doesn't come from The Ninja Academyit begins over a net. With your parents. In the circus. 6. At the rate Bruce is progressively losing brain cells in the original Batman films, it's a wonder they didn't explore his alcoholism over his dead parents. 7. A 25-year-old actor may be able to get away playing a teen, but not one that already looks over 30. 8. "Genius" Edward Nygma spends more than half the movie just deciding on the costume that rests two feet from him. 9. Recently, one of DC Comic's Green Lantern characters was deemed gay. But, Jim Carrey's own green DC Comic book character, The Riddler, actually came out 17 years prior. 10. Amazingly, Director Joel Schumacher didn't just play homage to the campy 1960's TV series; it made Adam West's Batman look deathly serious. 11. Myth: many believe George Clooney killed the bat in Batman & Robin. Fact: Val Kilmer had already put him on life support. 12. Asking your lover an important question and interrupting his answer with a kiss might, in fact, give you that answer. 13. Running out of alley space to escape those expendable villains? There's always the wall to drive up on, regardless of the lack of an exit plan. 14. Backwards thinking: This one should've been called Batman & Robin. 15. In the case of first two movies, or the two that follow, you will learn once again how Bruce became Batman with a flashback down that alley. Thank you; I have such a bad memory. 16. The Bat Signal is a perfect "beeper" for Commissioners, half-burned ex-D.A.'s dressed as the homeless or Australian lingerie models. 17. Actually, anyone can call upon Batman, even if you just wanted to "get drive thru" with him. 18. While it was impressive that the Riddler invented the very first 3-D TV, the only programs to watch were cartoon-rejects andfishing. 19. Two-Face had no idea how lucky he was that Bruce Wayne was in the same audience of fifty when he threatened to bomb the place in order for a spectator to reveal Batman's identity. 20. Even when the movie borderlined a serious topic, it quickly reverted back to the target audience of toddlers. Whew. 21. Alfred's good for two things: making lunch and consistently allowing strangers into the Batcave. 22. Oh, and snarling isn't going to stop a "teenager" from stealing the Batmobile, even if they wrote in the real Batman character in this picture and he thought of, God, any antitheft measures. 23. Further, while cruising Gotham, the Batmobile's hydraulics must come in handy for someone who shouldn't know how to drive the vehicle but can impress older women with the leaps. 24. The budget could've been cut in half if they simply made this live-action cartoon moviea cartoon in the first place. 25. Much like the Spielberg-less Jurassic Park III made us rethink our opinion of The Lost World, Batman Forever caused us to cherish Tim Burton's visions all the more. 26. Tommy Lee Jones channels Jack Nicholson's Joker fairly close as Two-Face, but that's not a positive. Who knew, in the future, Heath Ledger would be the one to reinvent Joker perfectly and Aaron Eckhart would shame Jones as Harvey Dent. 27. Catwoman can kick Chase's ass any day. 28. A decent score, workable cinematography and fantastic soundtrack does not equate a great movie. Otherwise, the middle Twilight films would be top notch. 29. In the future past 1995, Val Kilmer would get fat, Jim Carrey would hit and miss, Chris O'Donnell would, would, waitwho?, Tommy Lee Jones would thrive in black, Nicole Kidman would pass Tom Cruise's baton to future Dark Knight alumni Katie Holmes  who would eventually do the same and sadly, Michael Gough would just pass. But, above all others, thank God, Drew Barrymore would recover.

    This movie marks the start of when things went way wrong with the batman movies, and really this movie will only entertain children the ages of four to six, as I was one of them. Now that I'm much older from when I first saw this movie, I can see how this movie is terrible for most people, and why it's fun for the young kids. It's fun for children because it's a very lighthearted movie that has bright colors, goofy cartoonish villains, and of course you have the dynamic duo in the middle of all of this. Now I don't know if Joel Shumacher has made good movies outside of his batman movies, but judging on this one I'd say that he's probably the worst choice for directing this. Why, is because somehow he made usually great actors give razzie worthy performances, too colorful sets, terrible costumes, and some very cheesy dialogue ( the car right chicks love the car), which is getting way far away from what Batman is supposed to be, in favor of the campy 50's/60's batman of the comic books. Although Val Kilmer is probably not as bad as George Clooney, he still gives a very terrible performance in this, and with what he's working on I can see why. Tommy Lee Jones could have made a great two face, but instead he acts like a fool with bad looking makeup on. Jim Carrey really was only in this I think only to give his career a boost, and comes in way way over the top to the point of annoyance. Nicole Kidman as an original character really has no true purpose to be in the movie aside from the fact that she has to be eye candy for Batman. Chris O' Donnell as Robin spends half of the time whining about how he wants to be Batman's sidekick and kill two face, and probably gives the worst performance of this movie. I didn't find the story interesting at all, and found it to be very boring & stupid. I would rather drink water from a toilet than watch something like this.

    Batman Forever was the highly anticipated third film in the, up until this point hugely successful Batman series. Before Batman Forever Tim Burton had provided us with two absolutely mindblowing and never before seen adaptations of the Dark Knight on film. His dark, Gothic take on the comic book character was a perfect match and because of this Batman was no longer the camp, jokey image of the 60's, but a new true hero for the modern age. The film and it's sequel Batman & Robin are probably the best examples in movie history of what happens when a studio interferes with the creative process in order to make more money. Batman Forever, while still retaining some of the moody imagery of Burton, is a dumbed down, jokey, made for kids adventure that saw the series take a major downturn. The film has very high production values but these are lost in a sea of garish neon colours and odd camera angles. Director Joel Schumacher, a fine director in his own right seems to know absolutely nothing about the characters at all and we are left with a very find cast who seem to be winging it. Val Kilmer replaces the excellent Michael Keaton and to be fair, he has the look and the ability to pull of the character with ease but even he looks lost, unenthusiastic and probably wondering what the hell happened. No one can blame him for accepting the role without reading the script, based on the previous two movies I think anyone would kill to be in that position but it just didn't come off the way anyone expected and he was right not to return. The script is mostly terrible, jam packed full of juvenile humour which completely deflates any of the more serious scenes in the film (Of which there are quite a lot and are reasonably well done). The biggest joke in the film is the villains. Played completely like cartoon characters, there is zero sense of danger from two face and the Riddler. Tommy Lee Jones looks like he's having a real laugh playing two face which has a lot of energy but it is true that he seems to be taking his performance based on Jack Nicholson's Joker and Jim Carey, a man whom I normally love in films and thought was a perfect choice for the role, is just really Ace Ventura in a green suit for the whole film. A shame because I consider Carey a fine actor and would love to have seen that manic side used to portray a truly psychotic and evil version of the character. Instead we get humour of 5 year olds, terrible dialogue and cartoon boing sound effects. The film does have many good points, the cinematography is lush, it's a good length with plenty of other serious sub-plots to keep you interested. Chris O' Donnel excellent as Dick Grayson/Robin and he brings a real sense of seriousness and emotion to the film with his scenes. The big bonus is that Batman Forever provides more screen time to the wonderful Michael Gough who stayed on as butler Alfred from the Burton films. Batman Forever's biggest failing is that it tries to be a part of the world that the Burton films created. Had it been a fresh reboot it might have worked in it's own right. Essentially the filmmakers took what made the previous two films so popular, the moody and bizarre darkness and watered it down to a milky, money making fluid in order to get kids bums on cinema seats and it was pretty obviously done as well. There was a reason why Batman and Batman Returns did so well at the box office and have endured over the years with fans. Batman Forever did exceptionally well also but a lower age rating and a great franchise reputation were almost completely responsible for this success. If you are on a Batman Film binge then 'Forever' is worth tacking on to the end of the first two if you need more, but this is where things started to really go downhill.

    Batman Forever saw Val Kilmar make his debut as the Dark Knight and also a new director as Joel Schumacher comes on board. When Warner Brothers decided to replace director Tim Burton for a more slapstick style for the third installment of the franchise, many wondered if Joel Schumacher would match the award winning Batman Returns. Sadly more question marks surrounded Batman Forever then the latest Riddler outfit. In Batman Returns we had Michelle Pfeiffer in her charismatic role as Catwoman and Danny Devito as the scheming Pengiun. Now we are supplied with a over the top performance from Jim Carrey as he takes the role of the Riddler. Tommy Lee Jones gave a creditable performance as Two-Face although you wonder if he was what character he was playing as on a few occasions he reminded you more of the Joker, although it is fair to say this was probably caused by how the film was scripted rather then a actor's input. If your looking for a non stop action entertainment flick this will not disappoint but for those who are looking for more the same of Burton's earlier work it's best you give this one a miss.

    I am astonished looking at the reviews I'm reading here "reviewing" this movie. hm, more like bashing it. I've never seen a more pompous bunch of self righteous internet morons then the ones you see within the superhero fanboy community, Especially now in aftermath of the Chris Nolan "dark knight" movies (more like Dork knight). I have never seen a series of supposed "superhero" movie's take itself so damn seriously in my life. Did Nolan forget these movies are about a guy in a cape who dresses like a freaking BAT? I mean, yes we have to believe in it to some degree, but there's only so far you can go with trying to "legitimize" a comic book superhero. For crying out loud, he made the batmobile into a tank. A TANK! my Lord, that's the dumbest thing ever. So, here we have Batman Forever, a favorite childhood film of mine that I must have watched a million times on video along with the other 2 batman films. Its a film that does NOT take itself ultra seriously, a visual feast for the eyes and senses. It can indulge in its over the top comic book origins and knows how to have fun with it. People saying batman has to always be dark and beating criminals up to a bloody pulp are ignorant and have not seen or read many comic books, as this film is purposely taking its cue from the 40's and 50's comics which has sillier humorous elements but still were taking itself seriously. This is the BLOCKBUSTER batman that was much needed after the pretty depressing if misunderstood Batman Returns. This was wild summer entertainment in that year of 1995, everything was so great. Jim Carrey was at the top of his game with the ace ventura films, the Mask, dumb and dumber and is a riot as the Riddler. Tommy Lee Jones is a clearly having a blast as two-face, Nicole kidman has never ever been sexier then she is here. Val Kilmer may not be as quirky cool as Michael Keaton, but he looks great in the suit and is very physical, and batman has 2 of them in this movie including the "sonar" suit. Robin is brought in, and done convincingly well, not a corny Burt Ward robin at all. Pity he went from tough vengeful crime fighter to corny goofball in the next one, but here he is as a modern robin should be, tough with a sense of humor and not at all a goofball so its you can take him seriously. Gotham city is vibrant and lit up for the first time, which looks pretty spectacular. Batmans got a host of new rides including a more supped up batmobile with what I always thought was really neat blue lights through the ribbing, as well as a new batboat and batplane. The action scenes are incredible, things like the batmobile climbing up the wall, the bat boat and bat plane riding to claw island, batman and robin running into the bat signal. The iconic moments are there and it makes the film hugely enjoyable. unlike the recent overly serious drivel, this is a comic book film that's not at all afraid of being a comic book film. No attempt to be anything more the an amazing action adventure fantasy and it can be enjoyed by pretty much anyone. I watched this as a kid, loved it then, love it now. Saw the new ones and went what the hell did they do to my favorite superhero? Sad day. The "complaints" that you read about all the time by the nerds are, well, stupid. Yes, stupid. They cry the usual same mantra they have for years, "batnipples!" and "neon!", when the fact is, who REALLY cares about these things when actually watching the film? Do these minor details really destroy the entire film for these unfortunate people? Well, despite the losers down rating this, the fact is the film was hugely successful back in the day and most people still seem to enjoy it, and why not? It a very easy film to watch and its not SO kiddy as to block off all adult watchers. Comic book movies trying to be as realistic and dumb as they have been, I look at it like what a waste. The Batman film's used to be fun, inventive, wild and imaginative, as evidenced in this film. They filled the kid's as well as the adults with a sense of awe and wonder. Now hes a bore, catering to a society that has lost all sense of creativity and imagination. I think they should have stopped at Batman & Robin, because they are not getting any better, only worse.

    It's quite sad for me to watch Batman Forever, because it just doesn't live up to the first Batman film (Tim Burton's successful dark noir). Granted though, it is much better than it's sequel, Batman & Robin. An interesting thing I find is that the film is reasonably well cast; Val Kilmer isn't as awful as Clooney - doesn't really live up to Keaton and definitely not Bale - , Tommy Lee Jones was actually a pretty good casting for Harvey Dent/ Two-Face and Jim Carrey is...alright - he plays himself...again. Though I must talk about the Riddler, he is my all time favourite Batman villain. In the comics and the Arkham games, he is a mysterious man - in fact, he's a bit like Jigsaw from the Saw franchise - and has brilliant dress sense, these are the reasons I love him as a character. In Joel Schumacher's attempt, he is compelety the opposite; he is loud and has no panache, he could be slightly mysterious at times; like when he left all sorts of clues for Bruce, however, even then he started shouting about it. Don't even get me started on his attire - a full body spandex suit, true to the early comics but not the Riddler I fell in love with! Nicole Kidman's part was utterly pointless. Where did Vicki Vale and Selina Kyle disappear off to in the last films? Why is it that in every one of the Burton/Schumacher series, Batman has to have a different love interest? Heeesh, it really just riles me up!!! If this film had had a better director, this could have been my favourite Batman film, but it just didn't work. The villains were just copies of Jack Nicholson's Joker, there's a pointless love interest and Robin's origin story just bored me! There's another thing! If this movie wasn't a take back to the dreaded Adam West Batman, Robin's origin would have been amazing. Robin's origin still hasn't been done to my standards, Dark Knight Rises' attempt was a blatant shove-in! They just said his name was Robin! How was that relevant? I think if Tim Burton had directed this, It would have been quite good but he would probably make the same mistake as Schmacher did and just make it a second-rate version of his first film. He did the same thing in Batman Returns, by ignoring source material and just turning the Penguin into a shorter and more disgusting Joker - Penguin is not a psycho, like Joker, he is a criminal mastermind, a bit like Bane only no where near as strong. Though I think Tim Burton would have cast Johnny Depp as the Riddler and that may have had potential but my ideal cast to make this film so much better would be: Batman - Christian Bale (obviously), although it probably be Keaton, I don't think Bale was old enough at the time of the making of this movie. Two- Face - Harrison Ford Riddler - Neil Patrick Harris/David Tennant And of course, Christopher Nolan should direct! Riddler's objective in this film is a bit ludicrous as well, Riddler wants to get at Batman because he wants to prove that he is more intelligant than the World's Greatest Detective, he doesn't want to take over Gotham! Oh, and he mostly always works alone, so he probably would have killed Two-Face, not asked for his help! The film gets its rating just because the Riddler was in it, though it would have been higher if he was given a better performance. People who will like this: Children under 11, JIm Carrey fans People who won't like this: DC Comics fans, Riddler fans

In whole, the movie rather goes back to the old Batman series with all the campiness involved. There is a few laughs and a few references to the DC Comics universe... Watch it if you want to spend a good time watching Jim Carrey's antics, he is the show there... Riddle me this...

    Jim Carrey as the riddler was great and Val Kilmer did a pretty good performance as batman, but i don't understand how the great actor Tommy Lee Jones who won an academy award for the fugitive ruined this movie. He laughs almost all the time in the movie and behaves silly when he is with the riddler. according to me this is his worst role ever and it wasn't just the performance, it was the makeup and the clothes to: it was awful and made him look very bizarre rather then a cool scary looking guy which is how the two-face character is all about. This movie could have been great and even good as batman and batman returns if Tommy Lee Jones had done a serious two-face like Aaron Echart in the dark knight. instead it became the beginning of the end of the first batman movie franchise.

    "Falling Down" director Joel Schumacher replaced Tim Burton on the third live-action Caped Crusader epic "Batman Forever" with Val Kilmer donning the cape and cowl as the Dark Knight with Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey providing the menace. Unfortunately, as awful as the Michael Keaton "Batman" films were, "Batman Forever" qualifies as infinitely worse. This incredibly far-fetched adventure seems less contrived than "Batman" and "Batman Returns," but it suffers primarily from the shoddy screenplay writing skills of Lee Batchler, Janet Scott Batchler , and Akiva Goldsman. Handsome Val Kilmer looks better suited to play the vigilante crime fighter, but his Batman behaves like a complete bimbo. He does so many idiotic things that you just want to throw up your hands in frustration. He allows himself to be trapped early on in a safe bursting with boiling acid. Not long thereafter as millionaire Bruce Wayne, he smashes his way without solicitation into the heroine's apartment because he fears that she is being assaulted. Later, the two villains waltz into Wayne Manor with comparable ease and then invade the Batcave to wreck havoc. Despite all these dreadful mistakes, "Batman Forever" looks much better than its predecessors. "Lethal Weapon" lenser Stephen Goldblatt makes this outing look exceptional and Schumacher maintains a swift pace. Schumacher must have been channeling the 1966 "Batman" because the palette of colors appears brighter and less film noir-like that the Burton "Batman" epics. The production designs of Barbara Ling, Christopher Burian-Mohr and Joseph P. Lucky's art direction, and Ingrid Ferrin & Bob Ringwood's costume designs distinguish this flawed film. One of the biggest problems with "Batman Forever" is that Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey chew the scenery with such maniacal relish that Kilmer's Batman seems hopelessly dull by comparison. One of the few things that Schumacher manages to do with some success is replicate the death of Bruce's parents on a dark street. Since "Batman Forever" is a reboot, virtually all the equipment has been redesigned, such as the Batmobile. This exotic looking car looks like a souped-up sneaker. The Batwing and the Batboat look cool, but they aren't around long. Nevertheless, when the Batwing is blown out of the sky, it takes more than The Joker's well-aimed, .22 caliber long rifle bullet to do the job. The thing that sets this "Batman" outing apart from the two earlier examples is the inclusion of Robin the Boy Wonder. Chris O'Donnell appears almost too old to play the acrobatic Dick Grayson. If you're a Batman fanatic, you know that the death of the Flying Graysons was scrubbed from the first Keaton "Batman" with The Joker responsible for their deaths. The scenarists do a better job with the warped psychological problems that Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson suffer from than the outrageous plot that piles one dumb exploit on top of another. Although it is a comic book opus, "Batman Forever" looks more realistic than the Burton "Batman" movies because the physical sets have a great sense of authenticity.

    1. Billionaires know how to cut costs to maintain their fortress. Beginning with security. 2. Multi-ton safes are no match for one-inch metal-link chains. 3. Why waste your money on a dryer you need, when you can rely on a "Master Dick" to swing clothes around until partially dry like a pro. 4. Where Las Vegas uses this same tactic to attract visitors, Batman is literally trying to scare people off with his Batmobile's armor ofneon. 5. Being trained to fight off dozens of hoodlums doesn't come from The Ninja Academyit begins over a net. With your parents. In the circus. 6. At the rate Bruce is progressively losing brain cells in the original Batman films, it's a wonder they didn't explore his alcoholism over his dead parents. 7. A 25-year-old actor may be able to get away playing a teen, but not one that already looks over 30. 8. "Genius" Edward Nygma spends more than half the movie just deciding on the costume that rests two feet from him. 9. Recently, one of DC Comic's Green Lantern characters was deemed gay. But, Jim Carrey's own green DC Comic book character, The Riddler, actually came out 17 years prior. 10. Amazingly, Director Joel Schumacher didn't just play homage to the campy 1960's TV series; it made Adam West's Batman look deathly serious. 11. Myth: many believe George Clooney killed the bat in Batman & Robin. Fact: Val Kilmer had already put him on life support. 12. Asking your lover an important question and interrupting his answer with a kiss might, in fact, give you that answer. 13. Running out of alley space to escape those expendable villains? There's always the wall to drive up on, regardless of the lack of an exit plan. 14. Backwards thinking: This one should've been called Batman & Robin. 15. In the case of first two movies, or the two that follow, you will learn once again how Bruce became Batman with a flashback down that alley. Thank you; I have such a bad memory. 16. The Bat Signal is a perfect "beeper" for Commissioners, half-burned ex-D.A.'s dressed as the homeless or Australian lingerie models. 17. Actually, anyone can call upon Batman, even if you just wanted to "get drive thru" with him. 18. While it was impressive that the Riddler invented the very first 3-D TV, the only programs to watch were cartoon-rejects andfishing. 19. Two-Face had no idea how lucky he was that Bruce Wayne was in the same audience of fifty when he threatened to bomb the place in order for a spectator to reveal Batman's identity. 20. Even when the movie borderlined a serious topic, it quickly reverted back to the target audience of toddlers. Whew. 21. Alfred's good for two things: making lunch and consistently allowing strangers into the Batcave. 22. Oh, and snarling isn't going to stop a "teenager" from stealing the Batmobile, even if they wrote in the real Batman character in this picture and he thought of, God, any antitheft measures. 23. Further, while cruising Gotham, the Batmobile's hydraulics must come in handy for someone who shouldn't know how to drive the vehicle but can impress older women with the leaps. 24. The budget could've been cut in half if they simply made this live-action cartoon moviea cartoon in the first place. 25. Much like the Spielberg-less Jurassic Park III made us rethink our opinion of The Lost World, Batman Forever caused us to cherish Tim Burton's visions all the more. 26. Tommy Lee Jones channels Jack Nicholson's Joker fairly close as Two-Face, but that's not a positive. Who knew, in the future, Heath Ledger would be the one to reinvent Joker perfectly and Aaron Eckhart would shame Jones as Harvey Dent. 27. Catwoman can kick Chase's ass any day. 28. A decent score, workable cinematography and fantastic soundtrack does not equate a great movie. Otherwise, the middle Twilight films would be top notch. 29. In the future past 1995, Val Kilmer would get fat, Jim Carrey would hit and miss, Chris O'Donnell would, would, waitwho?, Tommy Lee Jones would thrive in black, Nicole Kidman would pass Tom Cruise's baton to future Dark Knight alumni Katie Holmes  who would eventually do the same and sadly, Michael Gough would just pass. But, above all others, thank God, Drew Barrymore would recover.

    This movie marks the start of when things went way wrong with the batman movies, and really this movie will only entertain children the ages of four to six, as I was one of them. Now that I'm much older from when I first saw this movie, I can see how this movie is terrible for most people, and why it's fun for the young kids. It's fun for children because it's a very lighthearted movie that has bright colors, goofy cartoonish villains, and of course you have the dynamic duo in the middle of all of this. Now I don't know if Joel Shumacher has made good movies outside of his batman movies, but judging on this one I'd say that he's probably the worst choice for directing this. Why, is because somehow he made usually great actors give razzie worthy performances, too colorful sets, terrible costumes, and some very cheesy dialogue ( the car right chicks love the car), which is getting way far away from what Batman is supposed to be, in favor of the campy 50's/60's batman of the comic books. Although Val Kilmer is probably not as bad as George Clooney, he still gives a very terrible performance in this, and with what he's working on I can see why. Tommy Lee Jones could have made a great two face, but instead he acts like a fool with bad looking makeup on. Jim Carrey really was only in this I think only to give his career a boost, and comes in way way over the top to the point of annoyance. Nicole Kidman as an original character really has no true purpose to be in the movie aside from the fact that she has to be eye candy for Batman. Chris O' Donnell as Robin spends half of the time whining about how he wants to be Batman's sidekick and kill two face, and probably gives the worst performance of this movie. I didn't find the story interesting at all, and found it to be very boring & stupid. I would rather drink water from a toilet than watch something like this.

    Batman Forever was the highly anticipated third film in the, up until this point hugely successful Batman series. Before Batman Forever Tim Burton had provided us with two absolutely mindblowing and never before seen adaptations of the Dark Knight on film. His dark, Gothic take on the comic book character was a perfect match and because of this Batman was no longer the camp, jokey image of the 60's, but a new true hero for the modern age. The film and it's sequel Batman & Robin are probably the best examples in movie history of what happens when a studio interferes with the creative process in order to make more money. Batman Forever, while still retaining some of the moody imagery of Burton, is a dumbed down, jokey, made for kids adventure that saw the series take a major downturn. The film has very high production values but these are lost in a sea of garish neon colours and odd camera angles. Director Joel Schumacher, a fine director in his own right seems to know absolutely nothing about the characters at all and we are left with a very find cast who seem to be winging it. Val Kilmer replaces the excellent Michael Keaton and to be fair, he has the look and the ability to pull of the character with ease but even he looks lost, unenthusiastic and probably wondering what the hell happened. No one can blame him for accepting the role without reading the script, based on the previous two movies I think anyone would kill to be in that position but it just didn't come off the way anyone expected and he was right not to return. The script is mostly terrible, jam packed full of juvenile humour which completely deflates any of the more serious scenes in the film (Of which there are quite a lot and are reasonably well done). The biggest joke in the film is the villains. Played completely like cartoon characters, there is zero sense of danger from two face and the Riddler. Tommy Lee Jones looks like he's having a real laugh playing two face which has a lot of energy but it is true that he seems to be taking his performance based on Jack Nicholson's Joker and Jim Carey, a man whom I normally love in films and thought was a perfect choice for the role, is just really Ace Ventura in a green suit for the whole film. A shame because I consider Carey a fine actor and would love to have seen that manic side used to portray a truly psychotic and evil version of the character. Instead we get humour of 5 year olds, terrible dialogue and cartoon boing sound effects. The film does have many good points, the cinematography is lush, it's a good length with plenty of other serious sub-plots to keep you interested. Chris O' Donnel excellent as Dick Grayson/Robin and he brings a real sense of seriousness and emotion to the film with his scenes. The big bonus is that Batman Forever provides more screen time to the wonderful Michael Gough who stayed on as butler Alfred from the Burton films. Batman Forever's biggest failing is that it tries to be a part of the world that the Burton films created. Had it been a fresh reboot it might have worked in it's own right. Essentially the filmmakers took what made the previous two films so popular, the moody and bizarre darkness and watered it down to a milky, money making fluid in order to get kids bums on cinema seats and it was pretty obviously done as well. There was a reason why Batman and Batman Returns did so well at the box office and have endured over the years with fans. Batman Forever did exceptionally well also but a lower age rating and a great franchise reputation were almost completely responsible for this success. If you are on a Batman Film binge then 'Forever' is worth tacking on to the end of the first two if you need more, but this is where things started to really go downhill.

    Batman Forever saw Val Kilmar make his debut as the Dark Knight and also a new director as Joel Schumacher comes on board. When Warner Brothers decided to replace director Tim Burton for a more slapstick style for the third installment of the franchise, many wondered if Joel Schumacher would match the award winning Batman Returns. Sadly more question marks surrounded Batman Forever then the latest Riddler outfit. In Batman Returns we had Michelle Pfeiffer in her charismatic role as Catwoman and Danny Devito as the scheming Pengiun. Now we are supplied with a over the top performance from Jim Carrey as he takes the role of the Riddler. Tommy Lee Jones gave a creditable performance as Two-Face although you wonder if he was what character he was playing as on a few occasions he reminded you more of the Joker, although it is fair to say this was probably caused by how the film was scripted rather then a actor's input. If your looking for a non stop action entertainment flick this will not disappoint but for those who are looking for more the same of Burton's earlier work it's best you give this one a miss.

    I am astonished looking at the reviews I'm reading here "reviewing" this movie. hm, more like bashing it. I've never seen a more pompous bunch of self righteous internet morons then the ones you see within the superhero fanboy community, Especially now in aftermath of the Chris Nolan "dark knight" movies (more like Dork knight). I have never seen a series of supposed "superhero" movie's take itself so damn seriously in my life. Did Nolan forget these movies are about a guy in a cape who dresses like a freaking BAT? I mean, yes we have to believe in it to some degree, but there's only so far you can go with trying to "legitimize" a comic book superhero. For crying out loud, he made the batmobile into a tank. A TANK! my Lord, that's the dumbest thing ever. So, here we have Batman Forever, a favorite childhood film of mine that I must have watched a million times on video along with the other 2 batman films. Its a film that does NOT take itself ultra seriously, a visual feast for the eyes and senses. It can indulge in its over the top comic book origins and knows how to have fun with it. People saying batman has to always be dark and beating criminals up to a bloody pulp are ignorant and have not seen or read many comic books, as this film is purposely taking its cue from the 40's and 50's comics which has sillier humorous elements but still were taking itself seriously. This is the BLOCKBUSTER batman that was much needed after the pretty depressing if misunderstood Batman Returns. This was wild summer entertainment in that year of 1995, everything was so great. Jim Carrey was at the top of his game with the ace ventura films, the Mask, dumb and dumber and is a riot as the Riddler. Tommy Lee Jones is a clearly having a blast as two-face, Nicole kidman has never ever been sexier then she is here. Val Kilmer may not be as quirky cool as Michael Keaton, but he looks great in the suit and is very physical, and batman has 2 of them in this movie including the "sonar" suit. Robin is brought in, and done convincingly well, not a corny Burt Ward robin at all. Pity he went from tough vengeful crime fighter to corny goofball in the next one, but here he is as a modern robin should be, tough with a sense of humor and not at all a goofball so its you can take him seriously. Gotham city is vibrant and lit up for the first time, which looks pretty spectacular. Batmans got a host of new rides including a more supped up batmobile with what I always thought was really neat blue lights through the ribbing, as well as a new batboat and batplane. The action scenes are incredible, things like the batmobile climbing up the wall, the bat boat and bat plane riding to claw island, batman and robin running into the bat signal. The iconic moments are there and it makes the film hugely enjoyable. unlike the recent overly serious drivel, this is a comic book film that's not at all afraid of being a comic book film. No attempt to be anything more the an amazing action adventure fantasy and it can be enjoyed by pretty much anyone. I watched this as a kid, loved it then, love it now. Saw the new ones and went what the hell did they do to my favorite superhero? Sad day. The "complaints" that you read about all the time by the nerds are, well, stupid. Yes, stupid. They cry the usual same mantra they have for years, "batnipples!" and "neon!", when the fact is, who REALLY cares about these things when actually watching the film? Do these minor details really destroy the entire film for these unfortunate people? Well, despite the losers down rating this, the fact is the film was hugely successful back in the day and most people still seem to enjoy it, and why not? It a very easy film to watch and its not SO kiddy as to block off all adult watchers. Comic book movies trying to be as realistic and dumb as they have been, I look at it like what a waste. The Batman film's used to be fun, inventive, wild and imaginative, as evidenced in this film. They filled the kid's as well as the adults with a sense of awe and wonder. Now hes a bore, catering to a society that has lost all sense of creativity and imagination. I think they should have stopped at Batman & Robin, because they are not getting any better, only worse.

    It's quite sad for me to watch Batman Forever, because it just doesn't live up to the first Batman film (Tim Burton's successful dark noir). Granted though, it is much better than it's sequel, Batman & Robin. An interesting thing I find is that the film is reasonably well cast; Val Kilmer isn't as awful as Clooney - doesn't really live up to Keaton and definitely not Bale - , Tommy Lee Jones was actually a pretty good casting for Harvey Dent/ Two-Face and Jim Carrey is...alright - he plays himself...again. Though I must talk about the Riddler, he is my all time favourite Batman villain. In the comics and the Arkham games, he is a mysterious man - in fact, he's a bit like Jigsaw from the Saw franchise - and has brilliant dress sense, these are the reasons I love him as a character. In Joel Schumacher's attempt, he is compelety the opposite; he is loud and has no panache, he could be slightly mysterious at times; like when he left all sorts of clues for Bruce, however, even then he started shouting about it. Don't even get me started on his attire - a full body spandex suit, true to the early comics but not the Riddler I fell in love with! Nicole Kidman's part was utterly pointless. Where did Vicki Vale and Selina Kyle disappear off to in the last films? Why is it that in every one of the Burton/Schumacher series, Batman has to have a different love interest? Heeesh, it really just riles me up!!! If this film had had a better director, this could have been my favourite Batman film, but it just didn't work. The villains were just copies of Jack Nicholson's Joker, there's a pointless love interest and Robin's origin story just bored me! There's another thing! If this movie wasn't a take back to the dreaded Adam West Batman, Robin's origin would have been amazing. Robin's origin still hasn't been done to my standards, Dark Knight Rises' attempt was a blatant shove-in! They just said his name was Robin! How was that relevant? I think if Tim Burton had directed this, It would have been quite good but he would probably make the same mistake as Schmacher did and just make it a second-rate version of his first film. He did the same thing in Batman Returns, by ignoring source material and just turning the Penguin into a shorter and more disgusting Joker - Penguin is not a psycho, like Joker, he is a criminal mastermind, a bit like Bane only no where near as strong. Though I think Tim Burton would have cast Johnny Depp as the Riddler and that may have had potential but my ideal cast to make this film so much better would be: Batman - Christian Bale (obviously), although it probably be Keaton, I don't think Bale was old enough at the time of the making of this movie. Two- Face - Harrison Ford Riddler - Neil Patrick Harris/David Tennant And of course, Christopher Nolan should direct! Riddler's objective in this film is a bit ludicrous as well, Riddler wants to get at Batman because he wants to prove that he is more intelligant than the World's Greatest Detective, he doesn't want to take over Gotham! Oh, and he mostly always works alone, so he probably would have killed Two-Face, not asked for his help! The film gets its rating just because the Riddler was in it, though it would have been higher if he was given a better performance. People who will like this: Children under 11, JIm Carrey fans People who won't like this: DC Comics fans, Riddler fans

    Saw this movie about 17 years it was released. Did watch it on video, but this time I had to see it on a big flat TV screen... Thus this movie has flaws, its main theme, which deals from dual personality to full insanity, hits the mark... Jim Carrey totally fly into this movie with all its craziness, Tommy Lee Jones as well, but sad they put Billy Dee Williams aside... Unable to judge if Val Kilmer was a good Bruce Wayne, he was OK to me. Only character which was flawed was Nicole Kidman's as Dr.Chase Meridian. Chris O'Donnell is OK as Robin. In whole, the movie rather goes back to the old Batman series with all the campiness involved. There is a few laughs and a few references to the DC Comics universe... Watch it if you want to spend a good time watching Jim Carrey's antics, he is the show there... Riddle me this...

    Jim Carrey as the riddler was great and Val Kilmer did a pretty good performance as batman, but i don't understand how the great actor Tommy Lee Jones who won an academy award for the fugitive ruined this movie. He laughs almost all the time in the movie and behaves silly when he is with the riddler. according to me this is his worst role ever and it wasn't just the performance, it was the makeup and the clothes to: it was awful and made him look very bizarre rather then a cool scary looking guy which is how the two-face character is all about. This movie could have been great and even good as batman and batman returns if Tommy Lee Jones had done a serious two-face like Aaron Echart in the dark knight. instead it became the beginning of the end of the first batman movie franchise.

    before watching this film you must think to your self ,Im just watching a entertaining pop corn flick because essentially that is what batman forever is as a film.Joel Schumacher brings a completely different type of batman movie ,this film is brighter and more visually appealing in my opinion to the Burton films.Gotham city is covered with tall towers, bright lights and colorful villains this time around .the whole film looks more like a comic book which is a good thing because this film aims to give a more comedic side to batman as his dialog is filled with puns and funny one liners ,even the small smirk in one scene made me feel that this was a much less darker version of batman.however this film has much more batman and not enough Bruce Wayne .Bruce/batman is played by val kilmer who does a good job but never really stands out thanks to a great standout performance from Jim Carey who pretty much saves this film from being a lot worse than it is with his eccentric and over the top personality he was a great casting decision to play riddler .unfortunately the same cannot be said for two face played by tommy lee Jone's who is only given a brief back story in comparison the riddler and is basically just very bland and boring when playing alongside Jim Carey.Nicole kidman is decent as Bruce Wayne's love interest and Chris'o' Donnell looks great as robin .the story in batman forever is mainly centered around how the riddler becomes a villain and the start of the relationship between batman and robin which i feel is a great idea since the previous two films made no attempt to add robin in despite him being a huge part of the comics and the show.i was happy watching Bruce's growing acceptance of having a partner and one scene i like in particular is when robin finds out that Bruce is batman and takes the the bat mobile for a joyride .the scene does a great job of making robins character very likable as we feel as though hes become a kid in a candy store enjoying all of Bruce's toys.besides whats already been mentioned this film did have an extremely silly and over the top plot but it works well since the film tries to go for a comedic and lighter tone .my main complaint is that the films action scenes just could've been a bit better and little things like batman getting sucked into a trap in the opening scene as if hes just a brain dead henchman .the film is an entertaining pop corn flick but by no means one of Batman's best work.

    "Falling Down" director Joel Schumacher replaced Tim Burton on the third live-action Caped Crusader epic "Batman Forever" with Val Kilmer donning the cape and cowl as the Dark Knight with Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey providing the menace. Unfortunately, as awful as the Michael Keaton "Batman" films were, "Batman Forever" qualifies as infinitely worse. This incredibly far-fetched adventure seems less contrived than "Batman" and "Batman Returns," but it suffers primarily from the shoddy screenplay writing skills of Lee Batchler, Janet Scott Batchler , and Akiva Goldsman. Handsome Val Kilmer looks better suited to play the vigilante crime fighter, but his Batman behaves like a complete bimbo. He does so many idiotic things that you just want to throw up your hands in frustration. He allows himself to be trapped early on in a safe bursting with boiling acid. Not long thereafter as millionaire Bruce Wayne, he smashes his way without solicitation into the heroine's apartment because he fears that she is being assaulted. Later, the two villains waltz into Wayne Manor with comparable ease and then invade the Batcave to wreck havoc. Despite all these dreadful mistakes, "Batman Forever" looks much better than its predecessors. "Lethal Weapon" lenser Stephen Goldblatt makes this outing look exceptional and Schumacher maintains a swift pace. Schumacher must have been channeling the 1966 "Batman" because the palette of colors appears brighter and less film noir-like that the Burton "Batman" epics. The production designs of Barbara Ling, Christopher Burian-Mohr and Joseph P. Lucky's art direction, and Ingrid Ferrin & Bob Ringwood's costume designs distinguish this flawed film. One of the biggest problems with "Batman Forever" is that Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey chew the scenery with such maniacal relish that Kilmer's Batman seems hopelessly dull by comparison. One of the few things that Schumacher manages to do with some success is replicate the death of Bruce's parents on a dark street. Since "Batman Forever" is a reboot, virtually all the equipment has been redesigned, such as the Batmobile. This exotic looking car looks like a souped-up sneaker. The Batwing and the Batboat look cool, but they aren't around long. Nevertheless, when the Batwing is blown out of the sky, it takes more than The Joker's well-aimed, .22 caliber long rifle bullet to do the job. The thing that sets this "Batman" outing apart from the two earlier examples is the inclusion of Robin the Boy Wonder. Chris O'Donnell appears almost too old to play the acrobatic Dick Grayson. If you're a Batman fanatic, you know that the death of the Flying Graysons was scrubbed from the first Keaton "Batman" with The Joker responsible for their deaths. The scenarists do a better job with the warped psychological problems that Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson suffer from than the outrageous plot that piles one dumb exploit on top of another. Although it is a comic book opus, "Batman Forever" looks more realistic than the Burton "Batman" movies because the physical sets have a great sense of authenticity.

A 25-year-old actor may be able to get away playing a teen, but not one that already looks over 30. 8. "Genius" Edward Nygma spends more than half the movie just deciding on the costume that rests two feet from him. 9. Recently, one of DC Comic's Green Lantern characters was deemed gay. But, Jim Carrey's own green DC Comic book character, The Riddler, actually came out 17 years prior. 10. Amazingly, Director Joel Schumacher didn't just play homage to the campy 1960's TV series; it made Adam West's Batman look deathly serious. 11. Myth: many believe George Clooney killed the bat in Batman & Robin. Fact: Val Kilmer had already put him on life support. 12. Asking your lover an important question and interrupting his answer with a kiss might, in fact, give you that answer. 13. Running out of alley space to escape those expendable villains? There's always the wall to drive up on, regardless of the lack of an exit plan. 14. Backwards thinking: This one should've been called Batman & Robin. 15. In the case of first two movies, or the two that follow, you will learn once again how Bruce became Batman with a flashback down that alley. Thank you; I have such a bad memory. 16. The Bat Signal is a perfect "beeper" for Commissioners, half-burned ex-D.A.'s dressed as the homeless or Australian lingerie models. 17. Actually, anyone can call upon Batman, even if you just wanted to "get drive thru" with him. 18. While it was impressive that the Riddler invented the very first 3-D TV, the only programs to watch were cartoon-rejects andfishing. 19. Two-Face had no idea how lucky he was that Bruce Wayne was in the same audience of fifty when he threatened to bomb the place in order for a spectator to reveal Batman's identity. 20. Even when the movie borderlined a serious topic, it quickly reverted back to the target audience of toddlers. Whew. 21. Alfred's good for two things: making lunch and consistently allowing strangers into the Batcave. 22. Oh, and snarling isn't going to stop a "teenager" from stealing the Batmobile, even if they wrote in the real Batman character in this picture and he thought of, God, any antitheft measures. 23. Further, while cruising Gotham, the Batmobile's hydraulics must come in handy for someone who shouldn't know how to drive the vehicle but can impress older women with the leaps. 24. The budget could've been cut in half if they simply made this live-action cartoon moviea cartoon in the first place. 25. Much like the Spielberg-less Jurassic Park III made us rethink our opinion of The Lost World, Batman Forever caused us to cherish Tim Burton's visions all the more. 26. Tommy Lee Jones channels Jack Nicholson's Joker fairly close as Two-Face, but that's not a positive. Who knew, in the future, Heath Ledger would be the one to reinvent Joker perfectly and Aaron Eckhart would shame Jones as Harvey Dent. 27. Catwoman can kick Chase's ass any day. 28. A decent score, workable cinematography and fantastic soundtrack does not equate a great movie. Otherwise, the middle Twilight films would be top notch. 29. In the future past 1995, Val Kilmer would get fat, Jim Carrey would hit and miss, Chris O'Donnell would, would, waitwho?, Tommy Lee Jones would thrive in black, Nicole Kidman would pass Tom Cruise's baton to future Dark Knight alumni Katie Holmes  who would eventually do the same and sadly, Michael Gough would just pass. But, above all others, thank God, Drew Barrymore would recover.

    This movie marks the start of when things went way wrong with the batman movies, and really this movie will only entertain children the ages of four to six, as I was one of them. Now that I'm much older from when I first saw this movie, I can see how this movie is terrible for most people, and why it's fun for the young kids. It's fun for children because it's a very lighthearted movie that has bright colors, goofy cartoonish villains, and of course you have the dynamic duo in the middle of all of this. Now I don't know if Joel Shumacher has made good movies outside of his batman movies, but judging on this one I'd say that he's probably the worst choice for directing this. Why, is because somehow he made usually great actors give razzie worthy performances, too colorful sets, terrible costumes, and some very cheesy dialogue ( the car right chicks love the car), which is getting way far away from what Batman is supposed to be, in favor of the campy 50's/60's batman of the comic books. Although Val Kilmer is probably not as bad as George Clooney, he still gives a very terrible performance in this, and with what he's working on I can see why. Tommy Lee Jones could have made a great two face, but instead he acts like a fool with bad looking makeup on. Jim Carrey really was only in this I think only to give his career a boost, and comes in way way over the top to the point of annoyance. Nicole Kidman as an original character really has no true purpose to be in the movie aside from the fact that she has to be eye candy for Batman. Chris O' Donnell as Robin spends half of the time whining about how he wants to be Batman's sidekick and kill two face, and probably gives the worst performance of this movie. I didn't find the story interesting at all, and found it to be very boring & stupid. I would rather drink water from a toilet than watch something like this.

    Batman Forever was the highly anticipated third film in the, up until this point hugely successful Batman series. Before Batman Forever Tim Burton had provided us with two absolutely mindblowing and never before seen adaptations of the Dark Knight on film. His dark, Gothic take on the comic book character was a perfect match and because of this Batman was no longer the camp, jokey image of the 60's, but a new true hero for the modern age. The film and it's sequel Batman & Robin are probably the best examples in movie history of what happens when a studio interferes with the creative process in order to make more money. Batman Forever, while still retaining some of the moody imagery of Burton, is a dumbed down, jokey, made for kids adventure that saw the series take a major downturn. The film has very high production values but these are lost in a sea of garish neon colours and odd camera angles. Director Joel Schumacher, a fine director in his own right seems to know absolutely nothing about the characters at all and we are left with a very find cast who seem to be winging it. Val Kilmer replaces the excellent Michael Keaton and to be fair, he has the look and the ability to pull of the character with ease but even he looks lost, unenthusiastic and probably wondering what the hell happened. No one can blame him for accepting the role without reading the script, based on the previous two movies I think anyone would kill to be in that position but it just didn't come off the way anyone expected and he was right not to return. The script is mostly terrible, jam packed full of juvenile humour which completely deflates any of the more serious scenes in the film (Of which there are quite a lot and are reasonably well done). The biggest joke in the film is the villains. Played completely like cartoon characters, there is zero sense of danger from two face and the Riddler. Tommy Lee Jones looks like he's having a real laugh playing two face which has a lot of energy but it is true that he seems to be taking his performance based on Jack Nicholson's Joker and Jim Carey, a man whom I normally love in films and thought was a perfect choice for the role, is just really Ace Ventura in a green suit for the whole film. A shame because I consider Carey a fine actor and would love to have seen that manic side used to portray a truly psychotic and evil version of the character. Instead we get humour of 5 year olds, terrible dialogue and cartoon boing sound effects. The film does have many good points, the cinematography is lush, it's a good length with plenty of other serious sub-plots to keep you interested. Chris O' Donnel excellent as Dick Grayson/Robin and he brings a real sense of seriousness and emotion to the film with his scenes. The big bonus is that Batman Forever provides more screen time to the wonderful Michael Gough who stayed on as butler Alfred from the Burton films. Batman Forever's biggest failing is that it tries to be a part of the world that the Burton films created. Had it been a fresh reboot it might have worked in it's own right. Essentially the filmmakers took what made the previous two films so popular, the moody and bizarre darkness and watered it down to a milky, money making fluid in order to get kids bums on cinema seats and it was pretty obviously done as well. There was a reason why Batman and Batman Returns did so well at the box office and have endured over the years with fans. Batman Forever did exceptionally well also but a lower age rating and a great franchise reputation were almost completely responsible for this success. If you are on a Batman Film binge then 'Forever' is worth tacking on to the end of the first two if you need more, but this is where things started to really go downhill.

    Batman Forever saw Val Kilmar make his debut as the Dark Knight and also a new director as Joel Schumacher comes on board. When Warner Brothers decided to replace director Tim Burton for a more slapstick style for the third installment of the franchise, many wondered if Joel Schumacher would match the award winning Batman Returns. Sadly more question marks surrounded Batman Forever then the latest Riddler outfit. In Batman Returns we had Michelle Pfeiffer in her charismatic role as Catwoman and Danny Devito as the scheming Pengiun. Now we are supplied with a over the top performance from Jim Carrey as he takes the role of the Riddler. Tommy Lee Jones gave a creditable performance as Two-Face although you wonder if he was what character he was playing as on a few occasions he reminded you more of the Joker, although it is fair to say this was probably caused by how the film was scripted rather then a actor's input. If your looking for a non stop action entertainment flick this will not disappoint but for those who are looking for more the same of Burton's earlier work it's best you give this one a miss.

    I am astonished looking at the reviews I'm reading here "reviewing" this movie. hm, more like bashing it. I've never seen a more pompous bunch of self righteous internet morons then the ones you see within the superhero fanboy community, Especially now in aftermath of the Chris Nolan "dark knight" movies (more like Dork knight). I have never seen a series of supposed "superhero" movie's take itself so damn seriously in my life. Did Nolan forget these movies are about a guy in a cape who dresses like a freaking BAT? I mean, yes we have to believe in it to some degree, but there's only so far you can go with trying to "legitimize" a comic book superhero. For crying out loud, he made the batmobile into a tank. A TANK! my Lord, that's the dumbest thing ever. So, here we have Batman Forever, a favorite childhood film of mine that I must have watched a million times on video along with the other 2 batman films. Its a film that does NOT take itself ultra seriously, a visual feast for the eyes and senses. It can indulge in its over the top comic book origins and knows how to have fun with it. People saying batman has to always be dark and beating criminals up to a bloody pulp are ignorant and have not seen or read many comic books, as this film is purposely taking its cue from the 40's and 50's comics which has sillier humorous elements but still were taking itself seriously. This is the BLOCKBUSTER batman that was much needed after the pretty depressing if misunderstood Batman Returns. This was wild summer entertainment in that year of 1995, everything was so great. Jim Carrey was at the top of his game with the ace ventura films, the Mask, dumb and dumber and is a riot as the Riddler. Tommy Lee Jones is a clearly having a blast as two-face, Nicole kidman has never ever been sexier then she is here. Val Kilmer may not be as quirky cool as Michael Keaton, but he looks great in the suit and is very physical, and batman has 2 of them in this movie including the "sonar" suit. Robin is brought in, and done convincingly well, not a corny Burt Ward robin at all. Pity he went from tough vengeful crime fighter to corny goofball in the next one, but here he is as a modern robin should be, tough with a sense of humor and not at all a goofball so its you can take him seriously. Gotham city is vibrant and lit up for the first time, which looks pretty spectacular. Batmans got a host of new rides including a more supped up batmobile with what I always thought was really neat blue lights through the ribbing, as well as a new batboat and batplane. The action scenes are incredible, things like the batmobile climbing up the wall, the bat boat and bat plane riding to claw island, batman and robin running into the bat signal. The iconic moments are there and it makes the film hugely enjoyable. unlike the recent overly serious drivel, this is a comic book film that's not at all afraid of being a comic book film. No attempt to be anything more the an amazing action adventure fantasy and it can be enjoyed by pretty much anyone. I watched this as a kid, loved it then, love it now. Saw the new ones and went what the hell did they do to my favorite superhero? Sad day. The "complaints" that you read about all the time by the nerds are, well, stupid. Yes, stupid. They cry the usual same mantra they have for years, "batnipples!" and "neon!", when the fact is, who REALLY cares about these things when actually watching the film? Do these minor details really destroy the entire film for these unfortunate people? Well, despite the losers down rating this, the fact is the film was hugely successful back in the day and most people still seem to enjoy it, and why not? It a very easy film to watch and its not SO kiddy as to block off all adult watchers. Comic book movies trying to be as realistic and dumb as they have been, I look at it like what a waste. The Batman film's used to be fun, inventive, wild and imaginative, as evidenced in this film. They filled the kid's as well as the adults with a sense of awe and wonder. Now hes a bore, catering to a society that has lost all sense of creativity and imagination. I think they should have stopped at Batman & Robin, because they are not getting any better, only worse.

    It's quite sad for me to watch Batman Forever, because it just doesn't live up to the first Batman film (Tim Burton's successful dark noir). Granted though, it is much better than it's sequel, Batman & Robin. An interesting thing I find is that the film is reasonably well cast; Val Kilmer isn't as awful as Clooney - doesn't really live up to Keaton and definitely not Bale - , Tommy Lee Jones was actually a pretty good casting for Harvey Dent/ Two-Face and Jim Carrey is...alright - he plays himself...again. Though I must talk about the Riddler, he is my all time favourite Batman villain. In the comics and the Arkham games, he is a mysterious man - in fact, he's a bit like Jigsaw from the Saw franchise - and has brilliant dress sense, these are the reasons I love him as a character. In Joel Schumacher's attempt, he is compelety the opposite; he is loud and has no panache, he could be slightly mysterious at times; like when he left all sorts of clues for Bruce, however, even then he started shouting about it. Don't even get me started on his attire - a full body spandex suit, true to the early comics but not the Riddler I fell in love with! Nicole Kidman's part was utterly pointless. Where did Vicki Vale and Selina Kyle disappear off to in the last films? Why is it that in every one of the Burton/Schumacher series, Batman has to have a different love interest? Heeesh, it really just riles me up!!! If this film had had a better director, this could have been my favourite Batman film, but it just didn't work. The villains were just copies of Jack Nicholson's Joker, there's a pointless love interest and Robin's origin story just bored me! There's another thing! If this movie wasn't a take back to the dreaded Adam West Batman, Robin's origin would have been amazing. Robin's origin still hasn't been done to my standards, Dark Knight Rises' attempt was a blatant shove-in! They just said his name was Robin! How was that relevant? I think if Tim Burton had directed this, It would have been quite good but he would probably make the same mistake as Schmacher did and just make it a second-rate version of his first film. He did the same thing in Batman Returns, by ignoring source material and just turning the Penguin into a shorter and more disgusting Joker - Penguin is not a psycho, like Joker, he is a criminal mastermind, a bit like Bane only no where near as strong. Though I think Tim Burton would have cast Johnny Depp as the Riddler and that may have had potential but my ideal cast to make this film so much better would be: Batman - Christian Bale (obviously), although it probably be Keaton, I don't think Bale was old enough at the time of the making of this movie. Two- Face - Harrison Ford Riddler - Neil Patrick Harris/David Tennant And of course, Christopher Nolan should direct! Riddler's objective in this film is a bit ludicrous as well, Riddler wants to get at Batman because he wants to prove that he is more intelligant than the World's Greatest Detective, he doesn't want to take over Gotham! Oh, and he mostly always works alone, so he probably would have killed Two-Face, not asked for his help! The film gets its rating just because the Riddler was in it, though it would have been higher if he was given a better performance. People who will like this: Children under 11, JIm Carrey fans People who won't like this: DC Comics fans, Riddler fans

    Saw this movie about 17 years it was released. Did watch it on video, but this time I had to see it on a big flat TV screen... Thus this movie has flaws, its main theme, which deals from dual personality to full insanity, hits the mark... Jim Carrey totally fly into this movie with all its craziness, Tommy Lee Jones as well, but sad they put Billy Dee Williams aside... Unable to judge if Val Kilmer was a good Bruce Wayne, he was OK to me. Only character which was flawed was Nicole Kidman's as Dr.Chase Meridian. Chris O'Donnell is OK as Robin. In whole, the movie rather goes back to the old Batman series with all the campiness involved. There is a few laughs and a few references to the DC Comics universe... Watch it if you want to spend a good time watching Jim Carrey's antics, he is the show there... Riddle me this...

    Jim Carrey as the riddler was great and Val Kilmer did a pretty good performance as batman, but i don't understand how the great actor Tommy Lee Jones who won an academy award for the fugitive ruined this movie. He laughs almost all the time in the movie and behaves silly when he is with the riddler. according to me this is his worst role ever and it wasn't just the performance, it was the makeup and the clothes to: it was awful and made him look very bizarre rather then a cool scary looking guy which is how the two-face character is all about. This movie could have been great and even good as batman and batman returns if Tommy Lee Jones had done a serious two-face like Aaron Echart in the dark knight. instead it became the beginning of the end of the first batman movie franchise.

    before watching this film you must think to your self ,Im just watching a entertaining pop corn flick because essentially that is what batman forever is as a film.Joel Schumacher brings a completely different type of batman movie ,this film is brighter and more visually appealing in my opinion to the Burton films.Gotham city is covered with tall towers, bright lights and colorful villains this time around .the whole film looks more like a comic book which is a good thing because this film aims to give a more comedic side to batman as his dialog is filled with puns and funny one liners ,even the small smirk in one scene made me feel that this was a much less darker version of batman.however this film has much more batman and not enough Bruce Wayne .Bruce/batman is played by val kilmer who does a good job but never really stands out thanks to a great standout performance from Jim Carey who pretty much saves this film from being a lot worse than it is with his eccentric and over the top personality he was a great casting decision to play riddler .unfortunately the same cannot be said for two face played by tommy lee Jone's who is only given a brief back story in comparison the riddler and is basically just very bland and boring when playing alongside Jim Carey.Nicole kidman is decent as Bruce Wayne's love interest and Chris'o' Donnell looks great as robin .the story in batman forever is mainly centered around how the riddler becomes a villain and the start of the relationship between batman and robin which i feel is a great idea since the previous two films made no attempt to add robin in despite him being a huge part of the comics and the show.i was happy watching Bruce's growing acceptance of having a partner and one scene i like in particular is when robin finds out that Bruce is batman and takes the the bat mobile for a joyride .the scene does a great job of making robins character very likable as we feel as though hes become a kid in a candy store enjoying all of Bruce's toys.besides whats already been mentioned this film did have an extremely silly and over the top plot but it works well since the film tries to go for a comedic and lighter tone .my main complaint is that the films action scenes just could've been a bit better and little things like batman getting sucked into a trap in the opening scene as if hes just a brain dead henchman .the film is an entertaining pop corn flick but by no means one of Batman's best work.

    "Falling Down" director Joel Schumacher replaced Tim Burton on the third live-action Caped Crusader epic "Batman Forever" with Val Kilmer donning the cape and cowl as the Dark Knight with Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey providing the menace. Unfortunately, as awful as the Michael Keaton "Batman" films were, "Batman Forever" qualifies as infinitely worse. This incredibly far-fetched adventure seems less contrived than "Batman" and "Batman Returns," but it suffers primarily from the shoddy screenplay writing skills of Lee Batchler, Janet Scott Batchler , and Akiva Goldsman. Handsome Val Kilmer looks better suited to play the vigilante crime fighter, but his Batman behaves like a complete bimbo. He does so many idiotic things that you just want to throw up your hands in frustration. He allows himself to be trapped early on in a safe bursting with boiling acid. Not long thereafter as millionaire Bruce Wayne, he smashes his way without solicitation into the heroine's apartment because he fears that she is being assaulted. Later, the two villains waltz into Wayne Manor with comparable ease and then invade the Batcave to wreck havoc. Despite all these dreadful mistakes, "Batman Forever" looks much better than its predecessors. "Lethal Weapon" lenser Stephen Goldblatt makes this outing look exceptional and Schumacher maintains a swift pace. Schumacher must have been channeling the 1966 "Batman" because the palette of colors appears brighter and less film noir-like that the Burton "Batman" epics. The production designs of Barbara Ling, Christopher Burian-Mohr and Joseph P. Lucky's art direction, and Ingrid Ferrin & Bob Ringwood's costume designs distinguish this flawed film. One of the biggest problems with "Batman Forever" is that Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey chew the scenery with such maniacal relish that Kilmer's Batman seems hopelessly dull by comparison. One of the few things that Schumacher manages to do with some success is replicate the death of Bruce's parents on a dark street. Since "Batman Forever" is a reboot, virtually all the equipment has been redesigned, such as the Batmobile. This exotic looking car looks like a souped-up sneaker. The Batwing and the Batboat look cool, but they aren't around long. Nevertheless, when the Batwing is blown out of the sky, it takes more than The Joker's well-aimed, .22 caliber long rifle bullet to do the job. The thing that sets this "Batman" outing apart from the two earlier examples is the inclusion of Robin the Boy Wonder. Chris O'Donnell appears almost too old to play the acrobatic Dick Grayson. If you're a Batman fanatic, you know that the death of the Flying Graysons was scrubbed from the first Keaton "Batman" with The Joker responsible for their deaths. The scenarists do a better job with the warped psychological problems that Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson suffer from than the outrageous plot that piles one dumb exploit on top of another. Although it is a comic book opus, "Batman Forever" looks more realistic than the Burton "Batman" movies because the physical sets have a great sense of authenticity.

Why waste your money on a dryer you need, when you can rely on a "Master Dick" to swing clothes around until partially dry like a pro. 4. Where Las Vegas uses this same tactic to attract visitors, Batman is literally trying to scare people off with his Batmobile's armor ofneon. 5.

Further, while cruising Gotham, the Batmobile's hydraulics must come in handy for someone who shouldn't know how to drive the vehicle but can impress older women with the leaps. 24. The budget could've been cut in half if they simply made this live-action cartoon moviea cartoon in the first place. 25. Much like the Spielberg-less Jurassic Park III made us rethink our opinion of The Lost World, Batman Forever caused us to cherish Tim Burton's visions all the more. 26. Tommy Lee Jones channels Jack Nicholson's Joker fairly close as Two-Face, but that's not a positive. Who knew, in the future, Heath Ledger would be the one to reinvent Joker perfectly and Aaron Eckhart would shame Jones as Harvey Dent. 27. Catwoman can kick Chase's ass any day. 28. A decent score, workable cinematography and fantastic soundtrack does not equate a great movie. Otherwise, the middle Twilight films would be top notch. 29. In the future past 1995, Val Kilmer would get fat, Jim Carrey would hit and miss, Chris O'Donnell would, would, waitwho?, Tommy Lee Jones would thrive in black, Nicole Kidman would pass Tom Cruise's baton to future Dark Knight alumni Katie Holmes  who would eventually do the same and sadly, Michael Gough would just pass. But, above all others, thank God, Drew Barrymore would recover.

    This movie marks the start of when things went way wrong with the batman movies, and really this movie will only entertain children the ages of four to six, as I was one of them. Now that I'm much older from when I first saw this movie, I can see how this movie is terrible for most people, and why it's fun for the young kids. It's fun for children because it's a very lighthearted movie that has bright colors, goofy cartoonish villains, and of course you have the dynamic duo in the middle of all of this. Now I don't know if Joel Shumacher has made good movies outside of his batman movies, but judging on this one I'd say that he's probably the worst choice for directing this. Why, is because somehow he made usually great actors give razzie worthy performances, too colorful sets, terrible costumes, and some very cheesy dialogue ( the car right chicks love the car), which is getting way far away from what Batman is supposed to be, in favor of the campy 50's/60's batman of the comic books. Although Val Kilmer is probably not as bad as George Clooney, he still gives a very terrible performance in this, and with what he's working on I can see why. Tommy Lee Jones could have made a great two face, but instead he acts like a fool with bad looking makeup on. Jim Carrey really was only in this I think only to give his career a boost, and comes in way way over the top to the point of annoyance. Nicole Kidman as an original character really has no true purpose to be in the movie aside from the fact that she has to be eye candy for Batman. Chris O' Donnell as Robin spends half of the time whining about how he wants to be Batman's sidekick and kill two face, and probably gives the worst performance of this movie. I didn't find the story interesting at all, and found it to be very boring & stupid. I would rather drink water from a toilet than watch something like this.

    Batman Forever was the highly anticipated third film in the, up until this point hugely successful Batman series. Before Batman Forever Tim Burton had provided us with two absolutely mindblowing and never before seen adaptations of the Dark Knight on film. His dark, Gothic take on the comic book character was a perfect match and because of this Batman was no longer the camp, jokey image of the 60's, but a new true hero for the modern age. The film and it's sequel Batman & Robin are probably the best examples in movie history of what happens when a studio interferes with the creative process in order to make more money. Batman Forever, while still retaining some of the moody imagery of Burton, is a dumbed down, jokey, made for kids adventure that saw the series take a major downturn. The film has very high production values but these are lost in a sea of garish neon colours and odd camera angles. Director Joel Schumacher, a fine director in his own right seems to know absolutely nothing about the characters at all and we are left with a very find cast who seem to be winging it. Val Kilmer replaces the excellent Michael Keaton and to be fair, he has the look and the ability to pull of the character with ease but even he looks lost, unenthusiastic and probably wondering what the hell happened. No one can blame him for accepting the role without reading the script, based on the previous two movies I think anyone would kill to be in that position but it just didn't come off the way anyone expected and he was right not to return. The script is mostly terrible, jam packed full of juvenile humour which completely deflates any of the more serious scenes in the film (Of which there are quite a lot and are reasonably well done). The biggest joke in the film is the villains. Played completely like cartoon characters, there is zero sense of danger from two face and the Riddler. Tommy Lee Jones looks like he's having a real laugh playing two face which has a lot of energy but it is true that he seems to be taking his performance based on Jack Nicholson's Joker and Jim Carey, a man whom I normally love in films and thought was a perfect choice for the role, is just really Ace Ventura in a green suit for the whole film. A shame because I consider Carey a fine actor and would love to have seen that manic side used to portray a truly psychotic and evil version of the character. Instead we get humour of 5 year olds, terrible dialogue and cartoon boing sound effects. The film does have many good points, the cinematography is lush, it's a good length with plenty of other serious sub-plots to keep you interested. Chris O' Donnel excellent as Dick Grayson/Robin and he brings a real sense of seriousness and emotion to the film with his scenes. The big bonus is that Batman Forever provides more screen time to the wonderful Michael Gough who stayed on as butler Alfred from the Burton films. Batman Forever's biggest failing is that it tries to be a part of the world that the Burton films created. Had it been a fresh reboot it might have worked in it's own right. Essentially the filmmakers took what made the previous two films so popular, the moody and bizarre darkness and watered it down to a milky, money making fluid in order to get kids bums on cinema seats and it was pretty obviously done as well. There was a reason why Batman and Batman Returns did so well at the box office and have endured over the years with fans. Batman Forever did exceptionally well also but a lower age rating and a great franchise reputation were almost completely responsible for this success. If you are on a Batman Film binge then 'Forever' is worth tacking on to the end of the first two if you need more, but this is where things started to really go downhill.

    Batman Forever saw Val Kilmar make his debut as the Dark Knight and also a new director as Joel Schumacher comes on board. When Warner Brothers decided to replace director Tim Burton for a more slapstick style for the third installment of the franchise, many wondered if Joel Schumacher would match the award winning Batman Returns. Sadly more question marks surrounded Batman Forever then the latest Riddler outfit. In Batman Returns we had Michelle Pfeiffer in her charismatic role as Catwoman and Danny Devito as the scheming Pengiun. Now we are supplied with a over the top performance from Jim Carrey as he takes the role of the Riddler. Tommy Lee Jones gave a creditable performance as Two-Face although you wonder if he was what character he was playing as on a few occasions he reminded you more of the Joker, although it is fair to say this was probably caused by how the film was scripted rather then a actor's input. If your looking for a non stop action entertainment flick this will not disappoint but for those who are looking for more the same of Burton's earlier work it's best you give this one a miss.

    I am astonished looking at the reviews I'm reading here "reviewing" this movie. hm, more like bashing it. I've never seen a more pompous bunch of self righteous internet morons then the ones you see within the superhero fanboy community, Especially now in aftermath of the Chris Nolan "dark knight" movies (more like Dork knight). I have never seen a series of supposed "superhero" movie's take itself so damn seriously in my life. Did Nolan forget these movies are about a guy in a cape who dresses like a freaking BAT? I mean, yes we have to believe in it to some degree, but there's only so far you can go with trying to "legitimize" a comic book superhero. For crying out loud, he made the batmobile into a tank. A TANK! my Lord, that's the dumbest thing ever. So, here we have Batman Forever, a favorite childhood film of mine that I must have watched a million times on video along with the other 2 batman films. Its a film that does NOT take itself ultra seriously, a visual feast for the eyes and senses. It can indulge in its over the top comic book origins and knows how to have fun with it. People saying batman has to always be dark and beating criminals up to a bloody pulp are ignorant and have not seen or read many comic books, as this film is purposely taking its cue from the 40's and 50's comics which has sillier humorous elements but still were taking itself seriously. This is the BLOCKBUSTER batman that was much needed after the pretty depressing if misunderstood Batman Returns. This was wild summer entertainment in that year of 1995, everything was so great. Jim Carrey was at the top of his game with the ace ventura films, the Mask, dumb and dumber and is a riot as the Riddler. Tommy Lee Jones is a clearly having a blast as two-face, Nicole kidman has never ever been sexier then she is here. Val Kilmer may not be as quirky cool as Michael Keaton, but he looks great in the suit and is very physical, and batman has 2 of them in this movie including the "sonar" suit. Robin is brought in, and done convincingly well, not a corny Burt Ward robin at all. Pity he went from tough vengeful crime fighter to corny goofball in the next one, but here he is as a modern robin should be, tough with a sense of humor and not at all a goofball so its you can take him seriously. Gotham city is vibrant and lit up for the first time, which looks pretty spectacular. Batmans got a host of new rides including a more supped up batmobile with what I always thought was really neat blue lights through the ribbing, as well as a new batboat and batplane. The action scenes are incredible, things like the batmobile climbing up the wall, the bat boat and bat plane riding to claw island, batman and robin running into the bat signal. The iconic moments are there and it makes the film hugely enjoyable. unlike the recent overly serious drivel, this is a comic book film that's not at all afraid of being a comic book film. No attempt to be anything more the an amazing action adventure fantasy and it can be enjoyed by pretty much anyone. I watched this as a kid, loved it then, love it now. Saw the new ones and went what the hell did they do to my favorite superhero? Sad day. The "complaints" that you read about all the time by the nerds are, well, stupid. Yes, stupid. They cry the usual same mantra they have for years, "batnipples!" and "neon!", when the fact is, who REALLY cares about these things when actually watching the film? Do these minor details really destroy the entire film for these unfortunate people? Well, despite the losers down rating this, the fact is the film was hugely successful back in the day and most people still seem to enjoy it, and why not? It a very easy film to watch and its not SO kiddy as to block off all adult watchers. Comic book movies trying to be as realistic and dumb as they have been, I look at it like what a waste. The Batman film's used to be fun, inventive, wild and imaginative, as evidenced in this film. They filled the kid's as well as the adults with a sense of awe and wonder. Now hes a bore, catering to a society that has lost all sense of creativity and imagination. I think they should have stopped at Batman & Robin, because they are not getting any better, only worse.

    It's quite sad for me to watch Batman Forever, because it just doesn't live up to the first Batman film (Tim Burton's successful dark noir). Granted though, it is much better than it's sequel, Batman & Robin. An interesting thing I find is that the film is reasonably well cast; Val Kilmer isn't as awful as Clooney - doesn't really live up to Keaton and definitely not Bale - , Tommy Lee Jones was actually a pretty good casting for Harvey Dent/ Two-Face and Jim Carrey is...alright - he plays himself...again. Though I must talk about the Riddler, he is my all time favourite Batman villain. In the comics and the Arkham games, he is a mysterious man - in fact, he's a bit like Jigsaw from the Saw franchise - and has brilliant dress sense, these are the reasons I love him as a character. In Joel Schumacher's attempt, he is compelety the opposite; he is loud and has no panache, he could be slightly mysterious at times; like when he left all sorts of clues for Bruce, however, even then he started shouting about it. Don't even get me started on his attire - a full body spandex suit, true to the early comics but not the Riddler I fell in love with! Nicole Kidman's part was utterly pointless. Where did Vicki Vale and Selina Kyle disappear off to in the last films? Why is it that in every one of the Burton/Schumacher series, Batman has to have a different love interest? Heeesh, it really just riles me up!!! If this film had had a better director, this could have been my favourite Batman film, but it just didn't work. The villains were just copies of Jack Nicholson's Joker, there's a pointless love interest and Robin's origin story just bored me! There's another thing! If this movie wasn't a take back to the dreaded Adam West Batman, Robin's origin would have been amazing. Robin's origin still hasn't been done to my standards, Dark Knight Rises' attempt was a blatant shove-in! They just said his name was Robin! How was that relevant? I think if Tim Burton had directed this, It would have been quite good but he would probably make the same mistake as Schmacher did and just make it a second-rate version of his first film. He did the same thing in Batman Returns, by ignoring source material and just turning the Penguin into a shorter and more disgusting Joker - Penguin is not a psycho, like Joker, he is a criminal mastermind, a bit like Bane only no where near as strong. Though I think Tim Burton would have cast Johnny Depp as the Riddler and that may have had potential but my ideal cast to make this film so much better would be: Batman - Christian Bale (obviously), although it probably be Keaton, I don't think Bale was old enough at the time of the making of this movie. Two- Face - Harrison Ford Riddler - Neil Patrick Harris/David Tennant And of course, Christopher Nolan should direct! Riddler's objective in this film is a bit ludicrous as well, Riddler wants to get at Batman because he wants to prove that he is more intelligant than the World's Greatest Detective, he doesn't want to take over Gotham! Oh, and he mostly always works alone, so he probably would have killed Two-Face, not asked for his help! The film gets its rating just because the Riddler was in it, though it would have been higher if he was given a better performance. People who will like this: Children under 11, JIm Carrey fans People who won't like this: DC Comics fans, Riddler fans

    Saw this movie about 17 years it was released. Did watch it on video, but this time I had to see it on a big flat TV screen... Thus this movie has flaws, its main theme, which deals from dual personality to full insanity, hits the mark... Jim Carrey totally fly into this movie with all its craziness, Tommy Lee Jones as well, but sad they put Billy Dee Williams aside... Unable to judge if Val Kilmer was a good Bruce Wayne, he was OK to me. Only character which was flawed was Nicole Kidman's as Dr.Chase Meridian. Chris O'Donnell is OK as Robin. In whole, the movie rather goes back to the old Batman series with all the campiness involved. There is a few laughs and a few references to the DC Comics universe... Watch it if you want to spend a good time watching Jim Carrey's antics, he is the show there... Riddle me this...

    Jim Carrey as the riddler was great and Val Kilmer did a pretty good performance as batman, but i don't understand how the great actor Tommy Lee Jones who won an academy award for the fugitive ruined this movie. He laughs almost all the time in the movie and behaves silly when he is with the riddler. according to me this is his worst role ever and it wasn't just the performance, it was the makeup and the clothes to: it was awful and made him look very bizarre rather then a cool scary looking guy which is how the two-face character is all about. This movie could have been great and even good as batman and batman returns if Tommy Lee Jones had done a serious two-face like Aaron Echart in the dark knight. instead it became the beginning of the end of the first batman movie franchise.

    before watching this film you must think to your self ,Im just watching a entertaining pop corn flick because essentially that is what batman forever is as a film.Joel Schumacher brings a completely different type of batman movie ,this film is brighter and more visually appealing in my opinion to the Burton films.Gotham city is covered with tall towers, bright lights and colorful villains this time around .the whole film looks more like a comic book which is a good thing because this film aims to give a more comedic side to batman as his dialog is filled with puns and funny one liners ,even the small smirk in one scene made me feel that this was a much less darker version of batman.however this film has much more batman and not enough Bruce Wayne .Bruce/batman is played by val kilmer who does a good job but never really stands out thanks to a great standout performance from Jim Carey who pretty much saves this film from being a lot worse than it is with his eccentric and over the top personality he was a great casting decision to play riddler .unfortunately the same cannot be said for two face played by tommy lee Jone's who is only given a brief back story in comparison the riddler and is basically just very bland and boring when playing alongside Jim Carey.Nicole kidman is decent as Bruce Wayne's love interest and Chris'o' Donnell looks great as robin .the story in batman forever is mainly centered around how the riddler becomes a villain and the start of the relationship between batman and robin which i feel is a great idea since the previous two films made no attempt to add robin in despite him being a huge part of the comics and the show.i was happy watching Bruce's growing acceptance of having a partner and one scene i like in particular is when robin finds out that Bruce is batman and takes the the bat mobile for a joyride .the scene does a great job of making robins character very likable as we feel as though hes become a kid in a candy store enjoying all of Bruce's toys.besides whats already been mentioned this film did have an extremely silly and over the top plot but it works well since the film tries to go for a comedic and lighter tone .my main complaint is that the films action scenes just could've been a bit better and little things like batman getting sucked into a trap in the opening scene as if hes just a brain dead henchman .the film is an entertaining pop corn flick but by no means one of Batman's best work.

    "Falling Down" director Joel Schumacher replaced Tim Burton on the third live-action Caped Crusader epic "Batman Forever" with Val Kilmer donning the cape and cowl as the Dark Knight with Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey providing the menace. Unfortunately, as awful as the Michael Keaton "Batman" films were, "Batman Forever" qualifies as infinitely worse. This incredibly far-fetched adventure seems less contrived than "Batman" and "Batman Returns," but it suffers primarily from the shoddy screenplay writing skills of Lee Batchler, Janet Scott Batchler , and Akiva Goldsman. Handsome Val Kilmer looks better suited to play the vigilante crime fighter, but his Batman behaves like a complete bimbo. He does so many idiotic things that you just want to throw up your hands in frustration. He allows himself to be trapped early on in a safe bursting with boiling acid. Not long thereafter as millionaire Bruce Wayne, he smashes his way without solicitation into the heroine's apartment because he fears that she is being assaulted. Later, the two villains waltz into Wayne Manor with comparable ease and then invade the Batcave to wreck havoc. Despite all these dreadful mistakes, "Batman Forever" looks much better than its predecessors. "Lethal Weapon" lenser Stephen Goldblatt makes this outing look exceptional and Schumacher maintains a swift pace. Schumacher must have been channeling the 1966 "Batman" because the palette of colors appears brighter and less film noir-like that the Burton "Batman" epics. The production designs of Barbara Ling, Christopher Burian-Mohr and Joseph P. Lucky's art direction, and Ingrid Ferrin & Bob Ringwood's costume designs distinguish this flawed film. One of the biggest problems with "Batman Forever" is that Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey chew the scenery with such maniacal relish that Kilmer's Batman seems hopelessly dull by comparison. One of the few things that Schumacher manages to do with some success is replicate the death of Bruce's parents on a dark street. Since "Batman Forever" is a reboot, virtually all the equipment has been redesigned, such as the Batmobile. This exotic looking car looks like a souped-up sneaker. The Batwing and the Batboat look cool, but they aren't around long. Nevertheless, when the Batwing is blown out of the sky, it takes more than The Joker's well-aimed, .22 caliber long rifle bullet to do the job. The thing that sets this "Batman" outing apart from the two earlier examples is the inclusion of Robin the Boy Wonder. Chris O'Donnell appears almost too old to play the acrobatic Dick Grayson. If you're a Batman fanatic, you know that the death of the Flying Graysons was scrubbed from the first Keaton "Batman" with The Joker responsible for their deaths. The scenarists do a better job with the warped psychological problems that Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson suffer from than the outrageous plot that piles one dumb exploit on top of another. Although it is a comic book opus, "Batman Forever" looks more realistic than the Burton "Batman" movies because the physical sets have a great sense of authenticity.

    1. Billionaires know how to cut costs to maintain their fortress. Beginning with security. 2. Multi-ton safes are no match for one-inch metal-link chains. 3. Why waste your money on a dryer you need, when you can rely on a "Master Dick" to swing clothes around until partially dry like a pro. 4. Where Las Vegas uses this same tactic to attract visitors, Batman is literally trying to scare people off with his Batmobile's armor ofneon. 5. Being trained to fight off dozens of hoodlums doesn't come from The Ninja Academyit begins over a net. With your parents. In the circus. 6. At the rate Bruce is progressively losing brain cells in the original Batman films, it's a wonder they didn't explore his alcoholism over his dead parents. 7. A 25-year-old actor may be able to get away playing a teen, but not one that already looks over 30. 8. "Genius" Edward Nygma spends more than half the movie just deciding on the costume that rests two feet from him. 9. Recently, one of DC Comic's Green Lantern characters was deemed gay. But, Jim Carrey's own green DC Comic book character, The Riddler, actually came out 17 years prior. 10. Amazingly, Director Joel Schumacher didn't just play homage to the campy 1960's TV series; it made Adam West's Batman look deathly serious. 11. Myth: many believe George Clooney killed the bat in Batman & Robin. Fact: Val Kilmer had already put him on life support. 12. Asking your lover an important question and interrupting his answer with a kiss might, in fact, give you that answer. 13. Running out of alley space to escape those expendable villains? There's always the wall to drive up on, regardless of the lack of an exit plan. 14. Backwards thinking: This one should've been called Batman & Robin. 15. In the case of first two movies, or the two that follow, you will learn once again how Bruce became Batman with a flashback down that alley. Thank you; I have such a bad memory. 16. The Bat Signal is a perfect "beeper" for Commissioners, half-burned ex-D.A.'s dressed as the homeless or Australian lingerie models. 17. Actually, anyone can call upon Batman, even if you just wanted to "get drive thru" with him. 18. While it was impressive that the Riddler invented the very first 3-D TV, the only programs to watch were cartoon-rejects andfishing. 19. Two-Face had no idea how lucky he was that Bruce Wayne was in the same audience of fifty when he threatened to bomb the place in order for a spectator to reveal Batman's identity. 20. Even when the movie borderlined a serious topic, it quickly reverted back to the target audience of toddlers. Whew. 21. Alfred's good for two things: making lunch and consistently allowing strangers into the Batcave. 22. Oh, and snarling isn't going to stop a "teenager" from stealing the Batmobile, even if they wrote in the real Batman character in this picture and he thought of, God, any antitheft measures. 23. Further, while cruising Gotham, the Batmobile's hydraulics must come in handy for someone who shouldn't know how to drive the vehicle but can impress older women with the leaps. 24. The budget could've been cut in half if they simply made this live-action cartoon moviea cartoon in the first place. 25. Much like the Spielberg-less Jurassic Park III made us rethink our opinion of The Lost World, Batman Forever caused us to cherish Tim Burton's visions all the more. 26. Tommy Lee Jones channels Jack Nicholson's Joker fairly close as Two-Face, but that's not a positive. Who knew, in the future, Heath Ledger would be the one to reinvent Joker perfectly and Aaron Eckhart would shame Jones as Harvey Dent. 27. Catwoman can kick Chase's ass any day. 28. A decent score, workable cinematography and fantastic soundtrack does not equate a great movie. Otherwise, the middle Twilight films would be top notch. 29. In the future past 1995, Val Kilmer would get fat, Jim Carrey would hit and miss, Chris O'Donnell would, would, waitwho?, Tommy Lee Jones would thrive in black, Nicole Kidman would pass Tom Cruise's baton to future Dark Knight alumni Katie Holmes  who would eventually do the same and sadly, Michael Gough would just pass. But, above all others, thank God, Drew Barrymore would recover.

    This movie marks the start of when things went way wrong with the batman movies, and really this movie will only entertain children the ages of four to six, as I was one of them. Now that I'm much older from when I first saw this movie, I can see how this movie is terrible for most people, and why it's fun for the young kids. It's fun for children because it's a very lighthearted movie that has bright colors, goofy cartoonish villains, and of course you have the dynamic duo in the middle of all of this. Now I don't know if Joel Shumacher has made good movies outside of his batman movies, but judging on this one I'd say that he's probably the worst choice for directing this. Why, is because somehow he made usually great actors give razzie worthy performances, too colorful sets, terrible costumes, and some very cheesy dialogue ( the car right chicks love the car), which is getting way far away from what Batman is supposed to be, in favor of the campy 50's/60's batman of the comic books. Although Val Kilmer is probably not as bad as George Clooney, he still gives a very terrible performance in this, and with what he's working on I can see why. Tommy Lee Jones could have made a great two face, but instead he acts like a fool with bad looking makeup on. Jim Carrey really was only in this I think only to give his career a boost, and comes in way way over the top to the point of annoyance. Nicole Kidman as an original character really has no true purpose to be in the movie aside from the fact that she has to be eye candy for Batman. Chris O' Donnell as Robin spends half of the time whining about how he wants to be Batman's sidekick and kill two face, and probably gives the worst performance of this movie. I didn't find the story interesting at all, and found it to be very boring & stupid. I would rather drink water from a toilet than watch something like this.

    Batman Forever was the highly anticipated third film in the, up until this point hugely successful Batman series. Before Batman Forever Tim Burton had provided us with two absolutely mindblowing and never before seen adaptations of the Dark Knight on film. His dark, Gothic take on the comic book character was a perfect match and because of this Batman was no longer the camp, jokey image of the 60's, but a new true hero for the modern age. The film and it's sequel Batman & Robin are probably the best examples in movie history of what happens when a studio interferes with the creative process in order to make more money. Batman Forever, while still retaining some of the moody imagery of Burton, is a dumbed down, jokey, made for kids adventure that saw the series take a major downturn. The film has very high production values but these are lost in a sea of garish neon colours and odd camera angles. Director Joel Schumacher, a fine director in his own right seems to know absolutely nothing about the characters at all and we are left with a very find cast who seem to be winging it. Val Kilmer replaces the excellent Michael Keaton and to be fair, he has the look and the ability to pull of the character with ease but even he looks lost, unenthusiastic and probably wondering what the hell happened. No one can blame him for accepting the role without reading the script, based on the previous two movies I think anyone would kill to be in that position but it just didn't come off the way anyone expected and he was right not to return. The script is mostly terrible, jam packed full of juvenile humour which completely deflates any of the more serious scenes in the film (Of which there are quite a lot and are reasonably well done). The biggest joke in the film is the villains. Played completely like cartoon characters, there is zero sense of danger from two face and the Riddler. Tommy Lee Jones looks like he's having a real laugh playing two face which has a lot of energy but it is true that he seems to be taking his performance based on Jack Nicholson's Joker and Jim Carey, a man whom I normally love in films and thought was a perfect choice for the role, is just really Ace Ventura in a green suit for the whole film. A shame because I consider Carey a fine actor and would love to have seen that manic side used to portray a truly psychotic and evil version of the character. Instead we get humour of 5 year olds, terrible dialogue and cartoon boing sound effects. The film does have many good points, the cinematography is lush, it's a good length with plenty of other serious sub-plots to keep you interested. Chris O' Donnel excellent as Dick Grayson/Robin and he brings a real sense of seriousness and emotion to the film with his scenes. The big bonus is that Batman Forever provides more screen time to the wonderful Michael Gough who stayed on as butler Alfred from the Burton films. Batman Forever's biggest failing is that it tries to be a part of the world that the Burton films created. Had it been a fresh reboot it might have worked in it's own right. Essentially the filmmakers took what made the previous two films so popular, the moody and bizarre darkness and watered it down to a milky, money making fluid in order to get kids bums on cinema seats and it was pretty obviously done as well. There was a reason why Batman and Batman Returns did so well at the box office and have endured over the years with fans. Batman Forever did exceptionally well also but a lower age rating and a great franchise reputation were almost completely responsible for this success. If you are on a Batman Film binge then 'Forever' is worth tacking on to the end of the first two if you need more, but this is where things started to really go downhill.

    Batman Forever saw Val Kilmar make his debut as the Dark Knight and also a new director as Joel Schumacher comes on board. When Warner Brothers decided to replace director Tim Burton for a more slapstick style for the third installment of the franchise, many wondered if Joel Schumacher would match the award winning Batman Returns. Sadly more question marks surrounded Batman Forever then the latest Riddler outfit. In Batman Returns we had Michelle Pfeiffer in her charismatic role as Catwoman and Danny Devito as the scheming Pengiun. Now we are supplied with a over the top performance from Jim Carrey as he takes the role of the Riddler. Tommy Lee Jones gave a creditable performance as Two-Face although you wonder if he was what character he was playing as on a few occasions he reminded you more of the Joker, although it is fair to say this was probably caused by how the film was scripted rather then a actor's input. If your looking for a non stop action entertainment flick this will not disappoint but for those who are looking for more the same of Burton's earlier work it's best you give this one a miss.

    I am astonished looking at the reviews I'm reading here "reviewing" this movie. hm, more like bashing it. I've never seen a more pompous bunch of self righteous internet morons then the ones you see within the superhero fanboy community, Especially now in aftermath of the Chris Nolan "dark knight" movies (more like Dork knight). I have never seen a series of supposed "superhero" movie's take itself so damn seriously in my life. Did Nolan forget these movies are about a guy in a cape who dresses like a freaking BAT? I mean, yes we have to believe in it to some degree, but there's only so far you can go with trying to "legitimize" a comic book superhero. For crying out loud, he made the batmobile into a tank. A TANK! my Lord, that's the dumbest thing ever. So, here we have Batman Forever, a favorite childhood film of mine that I must have watched a million times on video along with the other 2 batman films. Its a film that does NOT take itself ultra seriously, a visual feast for the eyes and senses. It can indulge in its over the top comic book origins and knows how to have fun with it. People saying batman has to always be dark and beating criminals up to a bloody pulp are ignorant and have not seen or read many comic books, as this film is purposely taking its cue from the 40's and 50's comics which has sillier humorous elements but still were taking itself seriously. This is the BLOCKBUSTER batman that was much needed after the pretty depressing if misunderstood Batman Returns. This was wild summer entertainment in that year of 1995, everything was so great. Jim Carrey was at the top of his game with the ace ventura films, the Mask, dumb and dumber and is a riot as the Riddler. Tommy Lee Jones is a clearly having a blast as two-face, Nicole kidman has never ever been sexier then she is here. Val Kilmer may not be as quirky cool as Michael Keaton, but he looks great in the suit and is very physical, and batman has 2 of them in this movie including the "sonar" suit. Robin is brought in, and done convincingly well, not a corny Burt Ward robin at all. Pity he went from tough vengeful crime fighter to corny goofball in the next one, but here he is as a modern robin should be, tough with a sense of humor and not at all a goofball so its you can take him seriously. Gotham city is vibrant and lit up for the first time, which looks pretty spectacular. Batmans got a host of new rides including a more supped up batmobile with what I always thought was really neat blue lights through the ribbing, as well as a new batboat and batplane. The action scenes are incredible, things like the batmobile climbing up the wall, the bat boat and bat plane riding to claw island, batman and robin running into the bat signal. The iconic moments are there and it makes the film hugely enjoyable. unlike the recent overly serious drivel, this is a comic book film that's not at all afraid of being a comic book film. No attempt to be anything more the an amazing action adventure fantasy and it can be enjoyed by pretty much anyone. I watched this as a kid, loved it then, love it now. Saw the new ones and went what the hell did they do to my favorite superhero? Sad day. The "complaints" that you read about all the time by the nerds are, well, stupid. Yes, stupid. They cry the usual same mantra they have for years, "batnipples!" and "neon!", when the fact is, who REALLY cares about these things when actually watching the film? Do these minor details really destroy the entire film for these unfortunate people? Well, despite the losers down rating this, the fact is the film was hugely successful back in the day and most people still seem to enjoy it, and why not? It a very easy film to watch and its not SO kiddy as to block off all adult watchers. Comic book movies trying to be as realistic and dumb as they have been, I look at it like what a waste. The Batman film's used to be fun, inventive, wild and imaginative, as evidenced in this film. They filled the kid's as well as the adults with a sense of awe and wonder. Now hes a bore, catering to a society that has lost all sense of creativity and imagination. I think they should have stopped at Batman & Robin, because they are not getting any better, only worse.

    It's quite sad for me to watch Batman Forever, because it just doesn't live up to the first Batman film (Tim Burton's successful dark noir). Granted though, it is much better than it's sequel, Batman & Robin. An interesting thing I find is that the film is reasonably well cast; Val Kilmer isn't as awful as Clooney - doesn't really live up to Keaton and definitely not Bale - , Tommy Lee Jones was actually a pretty good casting for Harvey Dent/ Two-Face and Jim Carrey is...alright - he plays himself...again. Though I must talk about the Riddler, he is my all time favourite Batman villain. In the comics and the Arkham games, he is a mysterious man - in fact, he's a bit like Jigsaw from the Saw franchise - and has brilliant dress sense, these are the reasons I love him as a character. In Joel Schumacher's attempt, he is compelety the opposite; he is loud and has no panache, he could be slightly mysterious at times; like when he left all sorts of clues for Bruce, however, even then he started shouting about it. Don't even get me started on his attire - a full body spandex suit, true to the early comics but not the Riddler I fell in love with! Nicole Kidman's part was utterly pointless. Where did Vicki Vale and Selina Kyle disappear off to in the last films? Why is it that in every one of the Burton/Schumacher series, Batman has to have a different love interest? Heeesh, it really just riles me up!!! If this film had had a better director, this could have been my favourite Batman film, but it just didn't work. The villains were just copies of Jack Nicholson's Joker, there's a pointless love interest and Robin's origin story just bored me! There's another thing! If this movie wasn't a take back to the dreaded Adam West Batman, Robin's origin would have been amazing. Robin's origin still hasn't been done to my standards, Dark Knight Rises' attempt was a blatant shove-in! They just said his name was Robin! How was that relevant? I think if Tim Burton had directed this, It would have been quite good but he would probably make the same mistake as Schmacher did and just make it a second-rate version of his first film. He did the same thing in Batman Returns, by ignoring source material and just turning the Penguin into a shorter and more disgusting Joker - Penguin is not a psycho, like Joker, he is a criminal mastermind, a bit like Bane only no where near as strong. Though I think Tim Burton would have cast Johnny Depp as the Riddler and that may have had potential but my ideal cast to make this film so much better would be: Batman - Christian Bale (obviously), although it probably be Keaton, I don't think Bale was old enough at the time of the making of this movie. Two- Face - Harrison Ford Riddler - Neil Patrick Harris/David Tennant And of course, Christopher Nolan should direct! Riddler's objective in this film is a bit ludicrous as well, Riddler wants to get at Batman because he wants to prove that he is more intelligant than the World's Greatest Detective, he doesn't want to take over Gotham! Oh, and he mostly always works alone, so he probably would have killed Two-Face, not asked for his help! The film gets its rating just because the Riddler was in it, though it would have been higher if he was given a better performance. People who will like this: Children under 11, JIm Carrey fans People who won't like this: DC Comics fans, Riddler fans

    Saw this movie about 17 years it was released. Did watch it on video, but this time I had to see it on a big flat TV screen... Thus this movie has flaws, its main theme, which deals from dual personality to full insanity, hits the mark... Jim Carrey totally fly into this movie with all its craziness, Tommy Lee Jones as well, but sad they put Billy Dee Williams aside... Unable to judge if Val Kilmer was a good Bruce Wayne, he was OK to me. Only character which was flawed was Nicole Kidman's as Dr.Chase Meridian. Chris O'Donnell is OK as Robin. In whole, the movie rather goes back to the old Batman series with all the campiness involved. There is a few laughs and a few references to the DC Comics universe... Watch it if you want to spend a good time watching Jim Carrey's antics, he is the show there... Riddle me this...

    Jim Carrey as the riddler was great and Val Kilmer did a pretty good performance as batman, but i don't understand how the great actor Tommy Lee Jones who won an academy award for the fugitive ruined this movie. He laughs almost all the time in the movie and behaves silly when he is with the riddler. according to me this is his worst role ever and it wasn't just the performance, it was the makeup and the clothes to: it was awful and made him look very bizarre rather then a cool scary looking guy which is how the two-face character is all about. This movie could have been great and even good as batman and batman returns if Tommy Lee Jones had done a serious two-face like Aaron Echart in the dark knight. instead it became the beginning of the end of the first batman movie franchise.

    before watching this film you must think to your self ,Im just watching a entertaining pop corn flick because essentially that is what batman forever is as a film.Joel Schumacher brings a completely different type of batman movie ,this film is brighter and more visually appealing in my opinion to the Burton films.Gotham city is covered with tall towers, bright lights and colorful villains this time around .the whole film looks more like a comic book which is a good thing because this film aims to give a more comedic side to batman as his dialog is filled with puns and funny one liners ,even the small smirk in one scene made me feel that this was a much less darker version of batman.however this film has much more batman and not enough Bruce Wayne .Bruce/batman is played by val kilmer who does a good job but never really stands out thanks to a great standout performance from Jim Carey who pretty much saves this film from being a lot worse than it is with his eccentric and over the top personality he was a great casting decision to play riddler .unfortunately the same cannot be said for two face played by tommy lee Jone's who is only given a brief back story in comparison the riddler and is basically just very bland and boring when playing alongside Jim Carey.Nicole kidman is decent as Bruce Wayne's love interest and Chris'o' Donnell looks great as robin .the story in batman forever is mainly centered around how the riddler becomes a villain and the start of the relationship between batman and robin which i feel is a great idea since the previous two films made no attempt to add robin in despite him being a huge part of the comics and the show.i was happy watching Bruce's growing acceptance of having a partner and one scene i like in particular is when robin finds out that Bruce is batman and takes the the bat mobile for a joyride .the scene does a great job of making robins character very likable as we feel as though hes become a kid in a candy store enjoying all of Bruce's toys.besides whats already been mentioned this film did have an extremely silly and over the top plot but it works well since the film tries to go for a comedic and lighter tone .my main complaint is that the films action scenes just could've been a bit better and little things like batman getting sucked into a trap in the opening scene as if hes just a brain dead henchman .the film is an entertaining pop corn flick but by no means one of Batman's best work.

    "Falling Down" director Joel Schumacher replaced Tim Burton on the third live-action Caped Crusader epic "Batman Forever" with Val Kilmer donning the cape and cowl as the Dark Knight with Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey providing the menace. Unfortunately, as awful as the Michael Keaton "Batman" films were, "Batman Forever" qualifies as infinitely worse. This incredibly far-fetched adventure seems less contrived than "Batman" and "Batman Returns," but it suffers primarily from the shoddy screenplay writing skills of Lee Batchler, Janet Scott Batchler , and Akiva Goldsman. Handsome Val Kilmer looks better suited to play the vigilante crime fighter, but his Batman behaves like a complete bimbo. He does so many idiotic things that you just want to throw up your hands in frustration. He allows himself to be trapped early on in a safe bursting with boiling acid. Not long thereafter as millionaire Bruce Wayne, he smashes his way without solicitation into the heroine's apartment because he fears that she is being assaulted. Later, the two villains waltz into Wayne Manor with comparable ease and then invade the Batcave to wreck havoc. Despite all these dreadful mistakes, "Batman Forever" looks much better than its predecessors. "Lethal Weapon" lenser Stephen Goldblatt makes this outing look exceptional and Schumacher maintains a swift pace. Schumacher must have been channeling the 1966 "Batman" because the palette of colors appears brighter and less film noir-like that the Burton "Batman" epics. The production designs of Barbara Ling, Christopher Burian-Mohr and Joseph P. Lucky's art direction, and Ingrid Ferrin & Bob Ringwood's costume designs distinguish this flawed film. One of the biggest problems with "Batman Forever" is that Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey chew the scenery with such maniacal relish that Kilmer's Batman seems hopelessly dull by comparison. One of the few things that Schumacher manages to do with some success is replicate the death of Bruce's parents on a dark street. Since "Batman Forever" is a reboot, virtually all the equipment has been redesigned, such as the Batmobile. This exotic looking car looks like a souped-up sneaker. The Batwing and the Batboat look cool, but they aren't around long. Nevertheless, when the Batwing is blown out of the sky, it takes more than The Joker's well-aimed, .22 caliber long rifle bullet to do the job. The thing that sets this "Batman" outing apart from the two earlier examples is the inclusion of Robin the Boy Wonder. Chris O'Donnell appears almost too old to play the acrobatic Dick Grayson. If you're a Batman fanatic, you know that the death of the Flying Graysons was scrubbed from the first Keaton "Batman" with The Joker responsible for their deaths. The scenarists do a better job with the warped psychological problems that Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson suffer from than the outrageous plot that piles one dumb exploit on top of another. Although it is a comic book opus, "Batman Forever" looks more realistic than the Burton "Batman" movies because the physical sets have a great sense of authenticity.

    1. Billionaires know how to cut costs to maintain their fortress. Beginning with security. 2. Multi-ton safes are no match for one-inch metal-link chains. 3. Why waste your money on a dryer you need, when you can rely on a "Master Dick" to swing clothes around until partially dry like a pro. 4. Where Las Vegas uses this same tactic to attract visitors, Batman is literally trying to scare people off with his Batmobile's armor ofneon. 5. Being trained to fight off dozens of hoodlums doesn't come from The Ninja Academyit begins over a net. With your parents. In the circus. 6. At the rate Bruce is progressively losing brain cells in the original Batman films, it's a wonder they didn't explore his alcoholism over his dead parents. 7. A 25-year-old actor may be able to get away playing a teen, but not one that already looks over 30. 8. "Genius" Edward Nygma spends more than half the movie just deciding on the costume that rests two feet from him. 9. Recently, one of DC Comic's Green Lantern characters was deemed gay. But, Jim Carrey's own green DC Comic book character, The Riddler, actually came out 17 years prior. 10. Amazingly, Director Joel Schumacher didn't just play homage to the campy 1960's TV series; it made Adam West's Batman look deathly serious. 11. Myth: many believe George Clooney killed the bat in Batman & Robin. Fact: Val Kilmer had already put him on life support. 12. Asking your lover an important question and interrupting his answer with a kiss might, in fact, give you that answer. 13. Running out of alley space to escape those expendable villains? There's always the wall to drive up on, regardless of the lack of an exit plan. 14. Backwards thinking: This one should've been called Batman & Robin. 15. In the case of first two movies, or the two that follow, you will learn once again how Bruce became Batman with a flashback down that alley. Thank you; I have such a bad memory. 16. The Bat Signal is a perfect "beeper" for Commissioners, half-burned ex-D.A.'s dressed as the homeless or Australian lingerie models. 17. Actually, anyone can call upon Batman, even if you just wanted to "get drive thru" with him. 18. While it was impressive that the Riddler invented the very first 3-D TV, the only programs to watch were cartoon-rejects andfishing. 19. Two-Face had no idea how lucky he was that Bruce Wayne was in the same audience of fifty when he threatened to bomb the place in order for a spectator to reveal Batman's identity. 20. Even when the movie borderlined a serious topic, it quickly reverted back to the target audience of toddlers. Whew. 21. Alfred's good for two things: making lunch and consistently allowing strangers into the Batcave. 22. Oh, and snarling isn't going to stop a "teenager" from stealing the Batmobile, even if they wrote in the real Batman character in this picture and he thought of, God, any antitheft measures. 23. Further, while cruising Gotham, the Batmobile's hydraulics must come in handy for someone who shouldn't know how to drive the vehicle but can impress older women with the leaps. 24. The budget could've been cut in half if they simply made this live-action cartoon moviea cartoon in the first place. 25. Much like the Spielberg-less Jurassic Park III made us rethink our opinion of The Lost World, Batman Forever caused us to cherish Tim Burton's visions all the more. 26. Tommy Lee Jones channels Jack Nicholson's Joker fairly close as Two-Face, but that's not a positive. Who knew, in the future, Heath Ledger would be the one to reinvent Joker perfectly and Aaron Eckhart would shame Jones as Harvey Dent. 27. Catwoman can kick Chase's ass any day. 28. A decent score, workable cinematography and fantastic soundtrack does not equate a great movie. Otherwise, the middle Twilight films would be top notch. 29. In the future past 1995, Val Kilmer would get fat, Jim Carrey would hit and miss, Chris O'Donnell would, would, waitwho?, Tommy Lee Jones would thrive in black, Nicole Kidman would pass Tom Cruise's baton to future Dark Knight alumni Katie Holmes  who would eventually do the same and sadly, Michael Gough would just pass. But, above all others, thank God, Drew Barrymore would recover.

    This movie marks the start of when things went way wrong with the batman movies, and really this movie will only entertain children the ages of four to six, as I was one of them. Now that I'm much older from when I first saw this movie, I can see how this movie is terrible for most people, and why it's fun for the young kids. It's fun for children because it's a very lighthearted movie that has bright colors, goofy cartoonish villains, and of course you have the dynamic duo in the middle of all of this. Now I don't know if Joel Shumacher has made good movies outside of his batman movies, but judging on this one I'd say that he's probably the worst choice for directing this. Why, is because somehow he made usually great actors give razzie worthy performances, too colorful sets, terrible costumes, and some very cheesy dialogue ( the car right chicks love the car), which is getting way far away from what Batman is supposed to be, in favor of the campy 50's/60's batman of the comic books. Although Val Kilmer is probably not as bad as George Clooney, he still gives a very terrible performance in this, and with what he's working on I can see why. Tommy Lee Jones could have made a great two face, but instead he acts like a fool with bad looking makeup on. Jim Carrey really was only in this I think only to give his career a boost, and comes in way way over the top to the point of annoyance. Nicole Kidman as an original character really has no true purpose to be in the movie aside from the fact that she has to be eye candy for Batman. Chris O' Donnell as Robin spends half of the time whining about how he wants to be Batman's sidekick and kill two face, and probably gives the worst performance of this movie. I didn't find the story interesting at all, and found it to be very boring & stupid. I would rather drink water from a toilet than watch something like this.
