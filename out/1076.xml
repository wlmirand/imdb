    Why is the movie telling kids to read more? Wouldn't that hurt your movie profit if all the children are reading books rather than watching your mediocre movie? I guess, I know why this movie bomb when it came out. Still, to me, personally. This movie isn't half bad. It's pretty OK to me. Take a look, it's in a book! Reading rainbow starts out, oops I meant, Page master starts out with ten year old Richard Tyler (Macaulay Culkin) who fears everything. By everything, I meant everything. He doesn't seem like not a real life character anyways due to his overused of statistics and encyclopedia size facts that come out of nowhere. I don't know why the movie choice Richard to be the main character, because he's probably had read some kind of book before. He had to get find those facts somewhere. He's already a book worm, but the movie is making him look like he never read a book before. One day, Richard gets caught in a harsh thunderstorm on a bike trip and takes shelter in a library. Here, he is met by Mr. Dewey (Christopher Lloyd), an eccentric librarian who tries to find a book for Richard and gives him a library card. Christopher Lloyd over acts and is somewhat creepy in this scene. Richard wanders off and finds a large rotunda painted with classic fictional characters that he supposing don't know of. Richard slips on some water that had dripped from his coat and falls down, hitting his head and knocking him unconscious. He awakens and finds the rotunda paintings melting, forming a wave of color that transforms him and the library into illustrations. This is where Director Jon Johnston ends, and directors of the animation parts, Pixote Hunt and Glenn Chaika start. Richard is approached by the Pagemaster (Also Christopher Lloyd) who sends him on a journey into the fiction section to find the "exit". It's funny how the Page Master puts Richard in life threating danger just to prove a point that he has courage in him. It's like putting a young baby in a lion cage and tell it to grow up. It's not like reading will make you brave, anyways. Only survivoring through those life threating events can do that. Reading about interesting characters in books isn't truly living, folks. Being a interesting character in real life and living through something is truly living. Along the way, Richard befriends three anthropomorphic books: Adventure (Patrick Stewart), a swashbuckling pirate like book; Fantasy (Whoopi Goldberg), a sassy but caring fairy tale book; and Horror (Frank Welker), a fearful "hunchbook" with a misshapen spine. I'm surprise that Sci-Fiction wasn't part of the group since a lot of children, I know. Read that. I guess nobody heard of that genre in Richard's world. At less, they didn't jump into young adult novels like Twilight. That would be horrible. The three agree to help Richard to find his way out if he checks them out with his library card. Together, the quartet encounter classic fictional characters and worlds on their way to the exit. I like how they try to put as much literature works into the film, but I have to question that most of the works they did put in, aren't technically for children. Example: the Hounds of Baskervilles has one of the hardest reading levels of all, due to its large amount of vocabulary, use of the English language, and large amounts of geographic and science facts. Not only that, it has a large amount of drug use, sex, and violence that isn't suite for children. Moby Dick wasn't written for children at all as well due to Melville employs stylized language, symbolism, slang language and the metaphor to explore numerous complex themes that would be way too complex for the normal ten year old first time reader. Still I like the fact, that they meet Dr. Jekyll (Leonard Nimoy) from the book Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Then Long John Silver (Jim Cummings) from Treasure Island. It's sad to say that both those classic animation characters are nothing like the literature in which they came from. Example: Dr. Jekyll, for example, isn't creepy and homicidal. He's just a scientist addicted to a potion that frees him from his uptight persona. It's only Mr. Hyde that acts upon crude action. It's ironic and hypocritical that the movie writer tries to use classic literary characters to make kids read books when the writer himself didn't read the books either. The characters were brief and unexplained, but also inaccurate. I do like how the majority of the cast has appeared in some form or another on Star Trek. The animation was pretty well. The paint dragon was badass for when this was made. If you look close, you'll find out that in the worlds are practically everything is made out of books. The rocks, the stairs, the houses. It's a nice little detail which the animators inserted. I love the soundtrack by James Horner. I thought the music in here was fantastic and often use in other film trailers and commercials. I find it weird that a movie is telling children to read, rather than schools or even the parents. I think the best way to get children to read is to turn off the television and read to them. Then allow them to read to you. Simple like that. You don't need this mess. movie to do that.

    The whole makeup of this film is an absolute bore-fest, you might as well sleep through the whole lot because it would be no different if you put the effort in to watch this film. I mean it's meant to be adventurous and epic, but the way it goes about it is enough to make you cringe. On top of that, it features many different characters of famous literature including Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Captain Ahab, The Tiny People of Gullivers Travels and Long John Silver, but the problem with all these cameo's is, it doesn't explain who these people are or why they're famous. They just appear and disappear without a word to the audience of who these people are or what they're known for. Worse still, it features the uselessly bland expression that is McCauley Caulkin, who was the eldest in a line of three brothers who continue to keep up the family tradition of blank emotionless faces and acting that makes you want to cry or question whether or not you have a soul left. The film begins with Richard Tyler, a young nervous bookworm of a boy who lives his life by statistics which means he hasn't the confidence to do fun things like most kids do without scrutinising them endlessly (if I had a child that bland I'd be very worried). Whilst building him a tree-house (which he most likely wont use), his father asks him to get some nails from the hardware store. Whilst on his way, Richard gets lost in a storm and finds his way to an old Library, where Christopher Lloyd is the strange Librarian who wants to enchant Richard into taking out some books from three categories, Horror, Adventure and Fantasy (treating them like they were the only three forms of book in existence, forget Sci-fi and Romantic Comedy, it's looks like there's only three in the world). But Richard only wants to use a phone. Whilst searching for the phone, he slips and falls, knocking himself out. When he comes to, the ceiling begins to drip on him and before long he is engulfed in a huge animated flood that transforms him into an illustration. He is soon confronted by the Pagemaster (a name that sounds dull to begin with, founder of the written word? More like founder of the most boring subject matter award!) He is soon sent off on a voyager (By way of supersonic library cart) and comes across his first booky friend, Adventure, a Scurvy Dog of a Book who wants Richard to check him out of the Library. It's not long before his second friend of the books arrives named Fantasy, a stuck up fairy like book. After escaping the Hounds of the Bascavilles, the trio becomes a quad as they bump into Horror, a simple minded book which is raggedy. Together, the group must find the Exit, but they must first face the various fictional monsters that lie ahead. Will Richard make it home? Will they ever find the Exit? Will Richard ever get his dad's nails? Set your alarm clock for 45 minutes time and you'll find out soon enough... Again, very boring subject matter which has no reference to any of the famous characters that are featured in the movie. There are only three categories of literature that are explored and there is no reference to any other category so for viewers who are not fully embalmed in the world of literacy, they'll only believe that these three categories exist. Big shocker when they bump into Sci-fi, Non-Fiction or Heavily Indulged Romance (I'm talking to you "50 Shades of Grey"). Granted the animation can be quite enjoyable and I really do see that a lot of effort was made into making this film, but if only their time and effort was put into something that wouldn't have viewers snoring away merrily within the first 5 minutes. Good for a watch on a wet Saturday afternoon, but other than that, a real turn off...

    Adding to the voices of those who found this movie awful, I can only add "Amen!" One question- the whole movie is devoted to showing the character how books can help him and early on the viewer discovers that he has never had a library card...how, then, did he get all the facts and statistics about accident probabilities that he was so obsessed with? And, what kid his age knows as much about accidents as the National Safety Council? The father character was complaining about his kid's obsession with safety and his fearfulness...OK, who put the "Safety Bike" together for the little bugger? The Caulkin character? Not even!! Utter hogwash...any good fantasy has at least a little believability factor...this one had zero from the outset. It struck me as a quickie film made to cash in on MC's popularity while it was still hot.

    - It's in the middle, by the waterfall! - No, it's East.. by some broccoli. I'm sorry. But I absolutely love this movie! I remember it so well from when I was a kid, how I watched it over and over again, never getting tired of it. For years I have been wanting to see it again, but I couldn't remember what it was called. And when I Finally found it, I was a bit scared to actually see it. I mean, whenever you have had so high expectations on a movie (especially one that you've seen and loved as a child) you always in some way get more or less disappointed. But this time I have to say I didn't! Sure, the colors and contrast isn't as powerful as it could be and the part where he gets chased by the color isn't half as realistic as I remembered it too be, but for a 4-yearold (which I was at the time this came out) it's more than enough to get the engines running! This movie is partially responsible for my massive interest and collection of fantasy-books and movies at home, as well as my ridiculous fear of thunder. I mean, come on, it's really nicely put together! It's got it all! Plus, even if they are only in there for a short period of time, you build up an interest for all the stories you come across throughout the story, like Moby Dick and Dr Jekyll. And that was the intention of the maker of this move, right? To get the children into reading. At least I remember asking my mum to read all those stories to me after seeing this! Okey, maybe I'm letting myself get a bit carried away.. I'll be honest, If I hadn't seen this as a kid or had kids myself, I probably wouldn't think that much of it. It's a bit dated which we all can tell and with todays technology you could make this 10 times better . But setting that aside, this is a timeless story! And I hope that when I have kids myself, this movie will help them get their lazy asses away from the computer and into the library. In the end I will not rate this movie from an adult living in our time's point of view, but from the heart of a little girl. And never the less, this adults heart still beats hard for this movie.

    I loved this movie as a kid, and hell, I STILL do. Some of the cgi doesn't holdup as well, but then again, this is 2010 and that was 1994, so I'll cut that some slack. Yeah, maybe from an adult's POV this movie isn't so incredible, but then again, this is a movie made for kids, and I liked it as a child. It was a lot of fun, and It's still, easily, my favorite animated (slash live-action) film of all-time. I knock it down from a 10 because of the running time (about 75 minutes) but other than that, I see nothing bad about this film. A fantastic ride from start to finish, this epic tale of a young boy who is way to afraid of everything who's path leads him to courage is one I'll never forget. A Truly underrated movie. 9/10

    The Pagemaster in my opinion, was a wonderful film, and I do think the 4.8 rating is too low. I have seen much worse movies, that are rated higher than that. Sure it's not Disney, but it is a good family film that I guarantee if you give it a chance that the whole family will love. The animation is not so bad, perhaps a little dated and rushed, but I've seen worse, and the dragon was excellent. The music by James Horner was beautiful, very fitting with what was going on on screen, very reminiscent of Land Before Time and Once Upon a Forest, and Whatever You imagine was amazing. The story tells of a young boy named Richard, who is serious and fearful of everything, until an unexpected visit to the library changes his life forever. I loved the story and the clever and diverse references to the literary giants, like Treasure Island, Jekyll and Hyde and Moby Dick, and the message of the film about facing your fears that doesn't preach. Macaulay Culkin is excellent here as is Christopher Lloyd, and Patrick Stewart (rousing and witty), Whoopi Goldberg (sugar and starch) and Frank Welker (in a fine Igor impression) expertly bring the snappy screenplay to life. I loved the witty banter between Adventure and Fantasy, and the librarian's rant about the different literary genres. And I don't think it is Macaulay Culkin or Christopher Lloyd's worst film, Culkin's was Richie Rich, Lloyd's was My Favourite Martian. All in all, a terrific film, with a 10/10. Bethany Cox

    I only review the movies I really adore, some will slip that I don't adore but this one isn't one of them, it seems that over the years people have lost a lot of imagination, it seems as we go through the future we realize what cannot be true is so phony, but as I see it people will return to it one time, I am still a really liker of imagination, but people today don't wanna believe the things that no one can believe, so because of that this movie haven't got a lot of good reviews, I want to do this movie justice... The pagemaster is made for kids and adults who still dreams, it isn't the most serious movie at all but it does have some spots that has deemed it serious, mostly it is a movie that should be taken lightly. This movie wants us to be taught something like many others of its nature, in this movie we are taught two major things first 1. to take choices and not be afraid, to do things we normally would be a afraid of as a child, second 2. it teaches us the main thing, to believe, simply just to believe, we all know none of this is real but why do we have to disband these movies, they are imagination, fantasy something many today could need a whole lot more of. This movie is also done very good by the actors, they chose the right actors for every voice in the movie, but my favorite is of course Christopher Loyd as the Pagemaster, the one who granted a single wish for a kid who were afraid of everything. The music is perfect in this movie, as it is a fantasy music like this is needed, this is something people and companies have at least kept forever and haven't still forgot, now if only they would do the same for fantasy, for imagination, we all have a child in us, why grow up so fast, we get to be mature but that doesn't mean we have to let go the things that made us into what we are today, many of these movies have been forgotten but they will always stay inside us, so now it is time to say that this movie is all that it is a classic, a classic people just forgot. As I said above I only do reviews of movies I like, not movies I don't like so of course this is one of my favorite, I grew up watching movies like this, enjoy it, and for do yourself a favor and watch it again, slowly fall inside imagination, just one more time, it is worth it...

    The story is OK, considering its for the younger generation or meant as a family movie. About the technical part, very well animated, pretty decent camera angles but a little poorly edited. This movie could've been a little longer. After about 26 minutes in begins to jump between stories and does so way to much and way to fast. Going from the Raven (short reference), Dr. Jeckyl and Mr Hyde, Moby Dick to Long John Silver. in a matter of 10 minutes. Also there is a sequence where two of the characters are presumed dead but you don't get a pause or anything. Allow the audience to savor the narrative and feel something about whats just happened. Also, some things makes no sense. Near the end of the story they get chased by a dragon. three characters hide in a cave and one keeps running. There is a short moment of romance between two characters, Adventure and Fantasy. First they kiss and everything is fine, then Adventure says something offending and gets kicked out of their shelter. Yes because we all know that remarks like that from someone you just kissed is punishable by death! How does that make sense? Also, Adventure gets INCINIRATED by the dragon but returns to the cave with a cartoonish "flamed" look. How does that make sense? Why run from something that can't harm you? Overall, its a OK movie. If you want a decent adventure movie aimed at children then you will enjoy the Pagemaster.

    A timid boy, frightened of everything, takes shelter in an empty library during a storm. While trying to make a phone call, he slips on the floor and is knocked unconscious. When he comes to, he is an illustration in a land of books, ruled by the mysterious Pagemaster. In order to get home again, he must face perilous adventures with the help of Fantasy, Adventure and Horror. When I was a child and a teenager, many years ago now, books were my best friends. I spent more time in Middle Earth, in nightmare worlds, in the future history of such writers as Heinlein, Asimov and Clarke, and in the worlds of Jules Verne, Lovecraft and Edgar Allan Poe than I did in the world of flesh and blood. Did you ever get so lost in the pages of a book that you were really there? The Pagemaster endeavors to put across this blending of reality and fiction which can only be achieved in the printed word, and while it doesn't completely succeed, it is a charming story and an entertaining family movie. It moves along quickly enough that it doesn't get boring. The mixture of live action and animation fits the story well, in the same way that the use of black and white and color suit The Wizard of Oz. Christopher Lloyd's performance in the early part of the film when he is clearly in love with books and thinks he has found a kindred spirit is brilliant. All in all, not a bad film. I think I prefer something like The Neverending Story (1984, Wolfgang Petersen) for a movie with a similar theme, but this is still fun and worth watching with the whole family.

    First of all, I'd like to point out that I saw this movie just by "accident". I mean, it was only by occasion that I had a chance to watch it and, even though I had not the foggiest idea of what was the movie about, I decided to watch it because I was in the mood of seeing something different. I knew this was an animated movie, but I didn't know it was a combination of live-action and animation. That was a big surprise when I started watching the movie. But even before that I was surprised when I looked at the opening credits because there was a list of famous actors, such as the legendary and unforgettable Macaulay Culkin, Cristopher Lloyd, Whoopi Goldberg and Patrick Stewart. I was delighted because it stars the great Macaulay Culkin. The story introduces Richard Tyler (portrayed by Macaulay Culkin), an intellectual boy obsessed and concerned about statistics of nearly everything. He lives with his parents but seems to be a lonely boy with practically no friends. That and his obsession for statistics worries his parents. When he goes to a library, he meets an eccentric librarian, Mr. Dewey (played by Cristopher Lloyd), who believes Richard is desperate for a book about a fantasy world with adventure, danger, darkness, dragons and so on. After that, Richard sees a spectacular roof painted with strange characters and fantastic creatures. Then he accidentally slips on some water and falls down unconscious. What's next? Well, Richard and everything around him is transformed into illustrations. Richard lives great dangers and adventures in a world of fantasy and horror, including being swallowed by a enormous fire-breathing dragon. The movie starts very well and (I've gotta admit this) it has some spectacular and very creative special effects in the library. Next, the movie becomes animated, but not for good. While the animation is good, I can't say the same about the rest. The designs/drawings, sceneries, picture quality and artwork in general are nothing but dreadful. That fantasy world is a horrible place. The animated characters themselves are, most of them, very ugly. The illustrated Richard looks good and similar to Macaulay Culkin and the giant dragon looks absolutely amazing, but the rest of the characters are too much and annoying, especially those animated books: Adventure (a pirate-like book), Fantasy (a fairy-tale shaped book) and Horror (a horrific-looking book). Through great part of the movie, I found similarities and common elements to other movies and stories. Where do I begin? The tree-house idea comes from "Home Alone". The fact that Macaulay Culkin wears glasses here is a similarity to his character from "My Girl". A treasure island and the one-legged pirate Long John Silver comes directly from "Treasure Island". There are also elements from "Peter Pan" and "Moby Dick". But that's not all: common elements with "Jack and the Beanstalk", "Harry Potter", "The Lord of the Rings", "The Black Cauldron", "Sleeping Beauty", "Ghost Busters" and even with Asian anime cartoons are another reality. Some similarities with "The NeverEnding Story" can be found either. In the fantasy world, Richard is sent to a quest to face his fears. Another good example is the fact that he goes to a library (in this case, in the live-action world) and meets an eccentric librarian who tells him about strange and fantastic stories. Another similarity is that Richard gets angry in the end, for all they made him been through. Back to real life and the live-action world, Richard is still unconscious but when he wakes up, he seems to become a stronger boy and more ready to face life's problems. A good movie? Definitely not for me. Like I said, it starts very well and promising, but turns out to be a major disappointment when it becomes animated. Its combination of so many stories doesn't work well and its artwork is really terrible. The movie is also extremely dark, like "The Black Cauldron" and "The Lord of the Rings", for example, which doesn't help either. Overall, a good movie for kids, but for adults I'm not so sure. It all depends on each person's tastes. At least Macaulay Culkin deserves credit for his performance. He might have messed up his life later, but he always proved to be an excellent actor. This was one of his last movies and may have been an attempt to do something different, but turned out to be unsuccessful.

Here, he is met by Mr. Dewey (Christopher Lloyd), an eccentric librarian who tries to find a book for Richard and gives him a library card. Christopher Lloyd over acts and is somewhat creepy in this scene. Richard wanders off and finds a large rotunda painted with classic fictional characters that he supposing don't know of. Richard slips on some water that had dripped from his coat and falls down, hitting his head and knocking him unconscious. He awakens and finds the rotunda paintings melting, forming a wave of color that transforms him and the library into illustrations. This is where Director Jon Johnston ends, and directors of the animation parts, Pixote Hunt and Glenn Chaika start. Richard is approached by the Pagemaster (Also Christopher Lloyd) who sends him on a journey into the fiction section to find the "exit". It's funny how the Page Master puts Richard in life threating danger just to prove a point that he has courage in him. It's like putting a young baby in a lion cage and tell it to grow up. It's not like reading will make you brave, anyways. Only survivoring through those life threating events can do that. Reading about interesting characters in books isn't truly living, folks.

Not only that, it has a large amount of drug use, sex, and violence that isn't suite for children. Moby Dick wasn't written for children at all as well due to Melville employs stylized language, symbolism, slang language and the metaphor to explore numerous complex themes that would be way too complex for the normal ten year old first time reader. Still I like the fact, that they meet Dr. Jekyll (Leonard Nimoy) from the book Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Then Long John Silver (Jim Cummings) from Treasure Island. It's sad to say that both those classic animation characters are nothing like the literature in which they came from. Example: Dr. Jekyll, for example, isn't creepy and homicidal. He's just a scientist addicted to a potion that frees him from his uptight persona. It's only Mr. Hyde that acts upon crude action. It's ironic and hypocritical that the movie writer tries to use classic literary characters to make kids read books when the writer himself didn't read the books either. The characters were brief and unexplained, but also inaccurate. I do like how the majority of the cast has appeared in some form or another on Star Trek. The animation was pretty well. The paint dragon was badass for when this was made. If you look close, you'll find out that in the worlds are practically everything is made out of books. The rocks, the stairs, the houses. It's a nice little detail which the animators inserted. I love the soundtrack by James Horner. I thought the music in here was fantastic and often use in other film trailers and commercials. I find it weird that a movie is telling children to read, rather than schools or even the parents. I think the best way to get children to read is to turn off the television and read to them. Then allow them to read to you. Simple like that. You don't need this mess. movie to do that.

    The whole makeup of this film is an absolute bore-fest, you might as well sleep through the whole lot because it would be no different if you put the effort in to watch this film. I mean it's meant to be adventurous and epic, but the way it goes about it is enough to make you cringe. On top of that, it features many different characters of famous literature including Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Captain Ahab, The Tiny People of Gullivers Travels and Long John Silver, but the problem with all these cameo's is, it doesn't explain who these people are or why they're famous. They just appear and disappear without a word to the audience of who these people are or what they're known for. Worse still, it features the uselessly bland expression that is McCauley Caulkin, who was the eldest in a line of three brothers who continue to keep up the family tradition of blank emotionless faces and acting that makes you want to cry or question whether or not you have a soul left. The film begins with Richard Tyler, a young nervous bookworm of a boy who lives his life by statistics which means he hasn't the confidence to do fun things like most kids do without scrutinising them endlessly (if I had a child that bland I'd be very worried). Whilst building him a tree-house (which he most likely wont use), his father asks him to get some nails from the hardware store. Whilst on his way, Richard gets lost in a storm and finds his way to an old Library, where Christopher Lloyd is the strange Librarian who wants to enchant Richard into taking out some books from three categories, Horror, Adventure and Fantasy (treating them like they were the only three forms of book in existence, forget Sci-fi and Romantic Comedy, it's looks like there's only three in the world). But Richard only wants to use a phone. Whilst searching for the phone, he slips and falls, knocking himself out. When he comes to, the ceiling begins to drip on him and before long he is engulfed in a huge animated flood that transforms him into an illustration. He is soon confronted by the Pagemaster (a name that sounds dull to begin with, founder of the written word? More like founder of the most boring subject matter award!) He is soon sent off on a voyager (By way of supersonic library cart) and comes across his first booky friend, Adventure, a Scurvy Dog of a Book who wants Richard to check him out of the Library. It's not long before his second friend of the books arrives named Fantasy, a stuck up fairy like book. After escaping the Hounds of the Bascavilles, the trio becomes a quad as they bump into Horror, a simple minded book which is raggedy. Together, the group must find the Exit, but they must first face the various fictional monsters that lie ahead. Will Richard make it home? Will they ever find the Exit? Will Richard ever get his dad's nails? Set your alarm clock for 45 minutes time and you'll find out soon enough... Again, very boring subject matter which has no reference to any of the famous characters that are featured in the movie. There are only three categories of literature that are explored and there is no reference to any other category so for viewers who are not fully embalmed in the world of literacy, they'll only believe that these three categories exist. Big shocker when they bump into Sci-fi, Non-Fiction or Heavily Indulged Romance (I'm talking to you "50 Shades of Grey"). Granted the animation can be quite enjoyable and I really do see that a lot of effort was made into making this film, but if only their time and effort was put into something that wouldn't have viewers snoring away merrily within the first 5 minutes. Good for a watch on a wet Saturday afternoon, but other than that, a real turn off...

    Adding to the voices of those who found this movie awful, I can only add "Amen!" One question- the whole movie is devoted to showing the character how books can help him and early on the viewer discovers that he has never had a library card...how, then, did he get all the facts and statistics about accident probabilities that he was so obsessed with? And, what kid his age knows as much about accidents as the National Safety Council? The father character was complaining about his kid's obsession with safety and his fearfulness...OK, who put the "Safety Bike" together for the little bugger? The Caulkin character? Not even!! Utter hogwash...any good fantasy has at least a little believability factor...this one had zero from the outset. It struck me as a quickie film made to cash in on MC's popularity while it was still hot.

    - It's in the middle, by the waterfall! - No, it's East.. by some broccoli. I'm sorry. But I absolutely love this movie! I remember it so well from when I was a kid, how I watched it over and over again, never getting tired of it. For years I have been wanting to see it again, but I couldn't remember what it was called. And when I Finally found it, I was a bit scared to actually see it. I mean, whenever you have had so high expectations on a movie (especially one that you've seen and loved as a child) you always in some way get more or less disappointed. But this time I have to say I didn't! Sure, the colors and contrast isn't as powerful as it could be and the part where he gets chased by the color isn't half as realistic as I remembered it too be, but for a 4-yearold (which I was at the time this came out) it's more than enough to get the engines running! This movie is partially responsible for my massive interest and collection of fantasy-books and movies at home, as well as my ridiculous fear of thunder. I mean, come on, it's really nicely put together! It's got it all! Plus, even if they are only in there for a short period of time, you build up an interest for all the stories you come across throughout the story, like Moby Dick and Dr Jekyll. And that was the intention of the maker of this move, right? To get the children into reading. At least I remember asking my mum to read all those stories to me after seeing this! Okey, maybe I'm letting myself get a bit carried away.. I'll be honest, If I hadn't seen this as a kid or had kids myself, I probably wouldn't think that much of it. It's a bit dated which we all can tell and with todays technology you could make this 10 times better . But setting that aside, this is a timeless story! And I hope that when I have kids myself, this movie will help them get their lazy asses away from the computer and into the library. In the end I will not rate this movie from an adult living in our time's point of view, but from the heart of a little girl. And never the less, this adults heart still beats hard for this movie.

    I loved this movie as a kid, and hell, I STILL do. Some of the cgi doesn't holdup as well, but then again, this is 2010 and that was 1994, so I'll cut that some slack. Yeah, maybe from an adult's POV this movie isn't so incredible, but then again, this is a movie made for kids, and I liked it as a child. It was a lot of fun, and It's still, easily, my favorite animated (slash live-action) film of all-time. I knock it down from a 10 because of the running time (about 75 minutes) but other than that, I see nothing bad about this film. A fantastic ride from start to finish, this epic tale of a young boy who is way to afraid of everything who's path leads him to courage is one I'll never forget. A Truly underrated movie. 9/10

    The Pagemaster in my opinion, was a wonderful film, and I do think the 4.8 rating is too low. I have seen much worse movies, that are rated higher than that. Sure it's not Disney, but it is a good family film that I guarantee if you give it a chance that the whole family will love. The animation is not so bad, perhaps a little dated and rushed, but I've seen worse, and the dragon was excellent. The music by James Horner was beautiful, very fitting with what was going on on screen, very reminiscent of Land Before Time and Once Upon a Forest, and Whatever You imagine was amazing. The story tells of a young boy named Richard, who is serious and fearful of everything, until an unexpected visit to the library changes his life forever. I loved the story and the clever and diverse references to the literary giants, like Treasure Island, Jekyll and Hyde and Moby Dick, and the message of the film about facing your fears that doesn't preach. Macaulay Culkin is excellent here as is Christopher Lloyd, and Patrick Stewart (rousing and witty), Whoopi Goldberg (sugar and starch) and Frank Welker (in a fine Igor impression) expertly bring the snappy screenplay to life. I loved the witty banter between Adventure and Fantasy, and the librarian's rant about the different literary genres. And I don't think it is Macaulay Culkin or Christopher Lloyd's worst film, Culkin's was Richie Rich, Lloyd's was My Favourite Martian. All in all, a terrific film, with a 10/10. Bethany Cox

    I only review the movies I really adore, some will slip that I don't adore but this one isn't one of them, it seems that over the years people have lost a lot of imagination, it seems as we go through the future we realize what cannot be true is so phony, but as I see it people will return to it one time, I am still a really liker of imagination, but people today don't wanna believe the things that no one can believe, so because of that this movie haven't got a lot of good reviews, I want to do this movie justice... The pagemaster is made for kids and adults who still dreams, it isn't the most serious movie at all but it does have some spots that has deemed it serious, mostly it is a movie that should be taken lightly. This movie wants us to be taught something like many others of its nature, in this movie we are taught two major things first 1. to take choices and not be afraid, to do things we normally would be a afraid of as a child, second 2. it teaches us the main thing, to believe, simply just to believe, we all know none of this is real but why do we have to disband these movies, they are imagination, fantasy something many today could need a whole lot more of. This movie is also done very good by the actors, they chose the right actors for every voice in the movie, but my favorite is of course Christopher Loyd as the Pagemaster, the one who granted a single wish for a kid who were afraid of everything. The music is perfect in this movie, as it is a fantasy music like this is needed, this is something people and companies have at least kept forever and haven't still forgot, now if only they would do the same for fantasy, for imagination, we all have a child in us, why grow up so fast, we get to be mature but that doesn't mean we have to let go the things that made us into what we are today, many of these movies have been forgotten but they will always stay inside us, so now it is time to say that this movie is all that it is a classic, a classic people just forgot. As I said above I only do reviews of movies I like, not movies I don't like so of course this is one of my favorite, I grew up watching movies like this, enjoy it, and for do yourself a favor and watch it again, slowly fall inside imagination, just one more time, it is worth it...

    The story is OK, considering its for the younger generation or meant as a family movie. About the technical part, very well animated, pretty decent camera angles but a little poorly edited. This movie could've been a little longer. After about 26 minutes in begins to jump between stories and does so way to much and way to fast. Going from the Raven (short reference), Dr. Jeckyl and Mr Hyde, Moby Dick to Long John Silver. in a matter of 10 minutes. Also there is a sequence where two of the characters are presumed dead but you don't get a pause or anything. Allow the audience to savor the narrative and feel something about whats just happened. Also, some things makes no sense. Near the end of the story they get chased by a dragon. three characters hide in a cave and one keeps running. There is a short moment of romance between two characters, Adventure and Fantasy. First they kiss and everything is fine, then Adventure says something offending and gets kicked out of their shelter. Yes because we all know that remarks like that from someone you just kissed is punishable by death! How does that make sense? Also, Adventure gets INCINIRATED by the dragon but returns to the cave with a cartoonish "flamed" look. How does that make sense? Why run from something that can't harm you? Overall, its a OK movie. If you want a decent adventure movie aimed at children then you will enjoy the Pagemaster.

    A timid boy, frightened of everything, takes shelter in an empty library during a storm. While trying to make a phone call, he slips on the floor and is knocked unconscious. When he comes to, he is an illustration in a land of books, ruled by the mysterious Pagemaster. In order to get home again, he must face perilous adventures with the help of Fantasy, Adventure and Horror. When I was a child and a teenager, many years ago now, books were my best friends. I spent more time in Middle Earth, in nightmare worlds, in the future history of such writers as Heinlein, Asimov and Clarke, and in the worlds of Jules Verne, Lovecraft and Edgar Allan Poe than I did in the world of flesh and blood. Did you ever get so lost in the pages of a book that you were really there? The Pagemaster endeavors to put across this blending of reality and fiction which can only be achieved in the printed word, and while it doesn't completely succeed, it is a charming story and an entertaining family movie. It moves along quickly enough that it doesn't get boring. The mixture of live action and animation fits the story well, in the same way that the use of black and white and color suit The Wizard of Oz. Christopher Lloyd's performance in the early part of the film when he is clearly in love with books and thinks he has found a kindred spirit is brilliant. All in all, not a bad film. I think I prefer something like The Neverending Story (1984, Wolfgang Petersen) for a movie with a similar theme, but this is still fun and worth watching with the whole family.

    First of all, I'd like to point out that I saw this movie just by "accident". I mean, it was only by occasion that I had a chance to watch it and, even though I had not the foggiest idea of what was the movie about, I decided to watch it because I was in the mood of seeing something different. I knew this was an animated movie, but I didn't know it was a combination of live-action and animation. That was a big surprise when I started watching the movie. But even before that I was surprised when I looked at the opening credits because there was a list of famous actors, such as the legendary and unforgettable Macaulay Culkin, Cristopher Lloyd, Whoopi Goldberg and Patrick Stewart. I was delighted because it stars the great Macaulay Culkin. The story introduces Richard Tyler (portrayed by Macaulay Culkin), an intellectual boy obsessed and concerned about statistics of nearly everything. He lives with his parents but seems to be a lonely boy with practically no friends. That and his obsession for statistics worries his parents. When he goes to a library, he meets an eccentric librarian, Mr. Dewey (played by Cristopher Lloyd), who believes Richard is desperate for a book about a fantasy world with adventure, danger, darkness, dragons and so on. After that, Richard sees a spectacular roof painted with strange characters and fantastic creatures. Then he accidentally slips on some water and falls down unconscious. What's next? Well, Richard and everything around him is transformed into illustrations. Richard lives great dangers and adventures in a world of fantasy and horror, including being swallowed by a enormous fire-breathing dragon. The movie starts very well and (I've gotta admit this) it has some spectacular and very creative special effects in the library. Next, the movie becomes animated, but not for good. While the animation is good, I can't say the same about the rest. The designs/drawings, sceneries, picture quality and artwork in general are nothing but dreadful. That fantasy world is a horrible place. The animated characters themselves are, most of them, very ugly. The illustrated Richard looks good and similar to Macaulay Culkin and the giant dragon looks absolutely amazing, but the rest of the characters are too much and annoying, especially those animated books: Adventure (a pirate-like book), Fantasy (a fairy-tale shaped book) and Horror (a horrific-looking book). Through great part of the movie, I found similarities and common elements to other movies and stories. Where do I begin? The tree-house idea comes from "Home Alone". The fact that Macaulay Culkin wears glasses here is a similarity to his character from "My Girl". A treasure island and the one-legged pirate Long John Silver comes directly from "Treasure Island". There are also elements from "Peter Pan" and "Moby Dick". But that's not all: common elements with "Jack and the Beanstalk", "Harry Potter", "The Lord of the Rings", "The Black Cauldron", "Sleeping Beauty", "Ghost Busters" and even with Asian anime cartoons are another reality. Some similarities with "The NeverEnding Story" can be found either. In the fantasy world, Richard is sent to a quest to face his fears. Another good example is the fact that he goes to a library (in this case, in the live-action world) and meets an eccentric librarian who tells him about strange and fantastic stories. Another similarity is that Richard gets angry in the end, for all they made him been through. Back to real life and the live-action world, Richard is still unconscious but when he wakes up, he seems to become a stronger boy and more ready to face life's problems. A good movie? Definitely not for me. Like I said, it starts very well and promising, but turns out to be a major disappointment when it becomes animated. Its combination of so many stories doesn't work well and its artwork is really terrible. The movie is also extremely dark, like "The Black Cauldron" and "The Lord of the Rings", for example, which doesn't help either. Overall, a good movie for kids, but for adults I'm not so sure. It all depends on each person's tastes. At least Macaulay Culkin deserves credit for his performance. He might have messed up his life later, but he always proved to be an excellent actor. This was one of his last movies and may have been an attempt to do something different, but turned out to be unsuccessful.

    Why is the movie telling kids to read more? Wouldn't that hurt your movie profit if all the children are reading books rather than watching your mediocre movie? I guess, I know why this movie bomb when it came out. Still, to me, personally. This movie isn't half bad. It's pretty OK to me. Take a look, it's in a book! Reading rainbow starts out, oops I meant, Page master starts out with ten year old Richard Tyler (Macaulay Culkin) who fears everything. By everything, I meant everything. He doesn't seem like not a real life character anyways due to his overused of statistics and encyclopedia size facts that come out of nowhere. I don't know why the movie choice Richard to be the main character, because he's probably had read some kind of book before. He had to get find those facts somewhere. He's already a book worm, but the movie is making him look like he never read a book before. One day, Richard gets caught in a harsh thunderstorm on a bike trip and takes shelter in a library. Here, he is met by Mr. Dewey (Christopher Lloyd), an eccentric librarian who tries to find a book for Richard and gives him a library card. Christopher Lloyd over acts and is somewhat creepy in this scene. Richard wanders off and finds a large rotunda painted with classic fictional characters that he supposing don't know of. Richard slips on some water that had dripped from his coat and falls down, hitting his head and knocking him unconscious. He awakens and finds the rotunda paintings melting, forming a wave of color that transforms him and the library into illustrations. This is where Director Jon Johnston ends, and directors of the animation parts, Pixote Hunt and Glenn Chaika start. Richard is approached by the Pagemaster (Also Christopher Lloyd) who sends him on a journey into the fiction section to find the "exit". It's funny how the Page Master puts Richard in life threating danger just to prove a point that he has courage in him. It's like putting a young baby in a lion cage and tell it to grow up. It's not like reading will make you brave, anyways. Only survivoring through those life threating events can do that. Reading about interesting characters in books isn't truly living, folks. Being a interesting character in real life and living through something is truly living. Along the way, Richard befriends three anthropomorphic books: Adventure (Patrick Stewart), a swashbuckling pirate like book; Fantasy (Whoopi Goldberg), a sassy but caring fairy tale book; and Horror (Frank Welker), a fearful "hunchbook" with a misshapen spine. I'm surprise that Sci-Fiction wasn't part of the group since a lot of children, I know. Read that. I guess nobody heard of that genre in Richard's world. At less, they didn't jump into young adult novels like Twilight. That would be horrible. The three agree to help Richard to find his way out if he checks them out with his library card. Together, the quartet encounter classic fictional characters and worlds on their way to the exit. I like how they try to put as much literature works into the film, but I have to question that most of the works they did put in, aren't technically for children. Example: the Hounds of Baskervilles has one of the hardest reading levels of all, due to its large amount of vocabulary, use of the English language, and large amounts of geographic and science facts. Not only that, it has a large amount of drug use, sex, and violence that isn't suite for children. Moby Dick wasn't written for children at all as well due to Melville employs stylized language, symbolism, slang language and the metaphor to explore numerous complex themes that would be way too complex for the normal ten year old first time reader. Still I like the fact, that they meet Dr. Jekyll (Leonard Nimoy) from the book Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Then Long John Silver (Jim Cummings) from Treasure Island. It's sad to say that both those classic animation characters are nothing like the literature in which they came from. Example: Dr. Jekyll, for example, isn't creepy and homicidal. He's just a scientist addicted to a potion that frees him from his uptight persona. It's only Mr. Hyde that acts upon crude action. It's ironic and hypocritical that the movie writer tries to use classic literary characters to make kids read books when the writer himself didn't read the books either. The characters were brief and unexplained, but also inaccurate. I do like how the majority of the cast has appeared in some form or another on Star Trek. The animation was pretty well. The paint dragon was badass for when this was made. If you look close, you'll find out that in the worlds are practically everything is made out of books. The rocks, the stairs, the houses. It's a nice little detail which the animators inserted. I love the soundtrack by James Horner. I thought the music in here was fantastic and often use in other film trailers and commercials. I find it weird that a movie is telling children to read, rather than schools or even the parents. I think the best way to get children to read is to turn off the television and read to them. Then allow them to read to you. Simple like that. You don't need this mess. movie to do that.

    The whole makeup of this film is an absolute bore-fest, you might as well sleep through the whole lot because it would be no different if you put the effort in to watch this film. I mean it's meant to be adventurous and epic, but the way it goes about it is enough to make you cringe. On top of that, it features many different characters of famous literature including Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Captain Ahab, The Tiny People of Gullivers Travels and Long John Silver, but the problem with all these cameo's is, it doesn't explain who these people are or why they're famous. They just appear and disappear without a word to the audience of who these people are or what they're known for. Worse still, it features the uselessly bland expression that is McCauley Caulkin, who was the eldest in a line of three brothers who continue to keep up the family tradition of blank emotionless faces and acting that makes you want to cry or question whether or not you have a soul left. The film begins with Richard Tyler, a young nervous bookworm of a boy who lives his life by statistics which means he hasn't the confidence to do fun things like most kids do without scrutinising them endlessly (if I had a child that bland I'd be very worried). Whilst building him a tree-house (which he most likely wont use), his father asks him to get some nails from the hardware store. Whilst on his way, Richard gets lost in a storm and finds his way to an old Library, where Christopher Lloyd is the strange Librarian who wants to enchant Richard into taking out some books from three categories, Horror, Adventure and Fantasy (treating them like they were the only three forms of book in existence, forget Sci-fi and Romantic Comedy, it's looks like there's only three in the world). But Richard only wants to use a phone. Whilst searching for the phone, he slips and falls, knocking himself out. When he comes to, the ceiling begins to drip on him and before long he is engulfed in a huge animated flood that transforms him into an illustration. He is soon confronted by the Pagemaster (a name that sounds dull to begin with, founder of the written word? More like founder of the most boring subject matter award!) He is soon sent off on a voyager (By way of supersonic library cart) and comes across his first booky friend, Adventure, a Scurvy Dog of a Book who wants Richard to check him out of the Library. It's not long before his second friend of the books arrives named Fantasy, a stuck up fairy like book. After escaping the Hounds of the Bascavilles, the trio becomes a quad as they bump into Horror, a simple minded book which is raggedy. Together, the group must find the Exit, but they must first face the various fictional monsters that lie ahead. Will Richard make it home? Will they ever find the Exit? Will Richard ever get his dad's nails? Set your alarm clock for 45 minutes time and you'll find out soon enough... Again, very boring subject matter which has no reference to any of the famous characters that are featured in the movie.

    Adding to the voices of those who found this movie awful, I can only add "Amen!" One question- the whole movie is devoted to showing the character how books can help him and early on the viewer discovers that he has never had a library card...how, then, did he get all the facts and statistics about accident probabilities that he was so obsessed with? And, what kid his age knows as much about accidents as the National Safety Council? The father character was complaining about his kid's obsession with safety and his fearfulness...OK, who put the "Safety Bike" together for the little bugger? The Caulkin character? Not even!! Utter hogwash...any good fantasy has at least a little believability factor...this one had zero from the outset. It struck me as a quickie film made to cash in on MC's popularity while it was still hot.

    - It's in the middle, by the waterfall! - No, it's East.. by some broccoli. I'm sorry. But I absolutely love this movie! I remember it so well from when I was a kid, how I watched it over and over again, never getting tired of it. For years I have been wanting to see it again, but I couldn't remember what it was called. And when I Finally found it, I was a bit scared to actually see it. I mean, whenever you have had so high expectations on a movie (especially one that you've seen and loved as a child) you always in some way get more or less disappointed. But this time I have to say I didn't! Sure, the colors and contrast isn't as powerful as it could be and the part where he gets chased by the color isn't half as realistic as I remembered it too be, but for a 4-yearold (which I was at the time this came out) it's more than enough to get the engines running! This movie is partially responsible for my massive interest and collection of fantasy-books and movies at home, as well as my ridiculous fear of thunder. I mean, come on, it's really nicely put together! It's got it all! Plus, even if they are only in there for a short period of time, you build up an interest for all the stories you come across throughout the story, like Moby Dick and Dr Jekyll. And that was the intention of the maker of this move, right? To get the children into reading. At least I remember asking my mum to read all those stories to me after seeing this! Okey, maybe I'm letting myself get a bit carried away.. I'll be honest, If I hadn't seen this as a kid or had kids myself, I probably wouldn't think that much of it. It's a bit dated which we all can tell and with todays technology you could make this 10 times better . But setting that aside, this is a timeless story! And I hope that when I have kids myself, this movie will help them get their lazy asses away from the computer and into the library. In the end I will not rate this movie from an adult living in our time's point of view, but from the heart of a little girl. And never the less, this adults heart still beats hard for this movie.

    I loved this movie as a kid, and hell, I STILL do. Some of the cgi doesn't holdup as well, but then again, this is 2010 and that was 1994, so I'll cut that some slack. Yeah, maybe from an adult's POV this movie isn't so incredible, but then again, this is a movie made for kids, and I liked it as a child. It was a lot of fun, and It's still, easily, my favorite animated (slash live-action) film of all-time. I knock it down from a 10 because of the running time (about 75 minutes) but other than that, I see nothing bad about this film. A fantastic ride from start to finish, this epic tale of a young boy who is way to afraid of everything who's path leads him to courage is one I'll never forget. A Truly underrated movie. 9/10

    The Pagemaster in my opinion, was a wonderful film, and I do think the 4.8 rating is too low. I have seen much worse movies, that are rated higher than that. Sure it's not Disney, but it is a good family film that I guarantee if you give it a chance that the whole family will love. The animation is not so bad, perhaps a little dated and rushed, but I've seen worse, and the dragon was excellent. The music by James Horner was beautiful, very fitting with what was going on on screen, very reminiscent of Land Before Time and Once Upon a Forest, and Whatever You imagine was amazing. The story tells of a young boy named Richard, who is serious and fearful of everything, until an unexpected visit to the library changes his life forever. I loved the story and the clever and diverse references to the literary giants, like Treasure Island, Jekyll and Hyde and Moby Dick, and the message of the film about facing your fears that doesn't preach. Macaulay Culkin is excellent here as is Christopher Lloyd, and Patrick Stewart (rousing and witty), Whoopi Goldberg (sugar and starch) and Frank Welker (in a fine Igor impression) expertly bring the snappy screenplay to life. I loved the witty banter between Adventure and Fantasy, and the librarian's rant about the different literary genres. And I don't think it is Macaulay Culkin or Christopher Lloyd's worst film, Culkin's was Richie Rich, Lloyd's was My Favourite Martian. All in all, a terrific film, with a 10/10. Bethany Cox

    I only review the movies I really adore, some will slip that I don't adore but this one isn't one of them, it seems that over the years people have lost a lot of imagination, it seems as we go through the future we realize what cannot be true is so phony, but as I see it people will return to it one time, I am still a really liker of imagination, but people today don't wanna believe the things that no one can believe, so because of that this movie haven't got a lot of good reviews, I want to do this movie justice... The pagemaster is made for kids and adults who still dreams, it isn't the most serious movie at all but it does have some spots that has deemed it serious, mostly it is a movie that should be taken lightly. This movie wants us to be taught something like many others of its nature, in this movie we are taught two major things first 1. to take choices and not be afraid, to do things we normally would be a afraid of as a child, second 2. it teaches us the main thing, to believe, simply just to believe, we all know none of this is real but why do we have to disband these movies, they are imagination, fantasy something many today could need a whole lot more of. This movie is also done very good by the actors, they chose the right actors for every voice in the movie, but my favorite is of course Christopher Loyd as the Pagemaster, the one who granted a single wish for a kid who were afraid of everything. The music is perfect in this movie, as it is a fantasy music like this is needed, this is something people and companies have at least kept forever and haven't still forgot, now if only they would do the same for fantasy, for imagination, we all have a child in us, why grow up so fast, we get to be mature but that doesn't mean we have to let go the things that made us into what we are today, many of these movies have been forgotten but they will always stay inside us, so now it is time to say that this movie is all that it is a classic, a classic people just forgot. As I said above I only do reviews of movies I like, not movies I don't like so of course this is one of my favorite, I grew up watching movies like this, enjoy it, and for do yourself a favor and watch it again, slowly fall inside imagination, just one more time, it is worth it...

    The story is OK, considering its for the younger generation or meant as a family movie. About the technical part, very well animated, pretty decent camera angles but a little poorly edited. This movie could've been a little longer. After about 26 minutes in begins to jump between stories and does so way to much and way to fast. Going from the Raven (short reference), Dr. Jeckyl and Mr Hyde, Moby Dick to Long John Silver. in a matter of 10 minutes. Also there is a sequence where two of the characters are presumed dead but you don't get a pause or anything. Allow the audience to savor the narrative and feel something about whats just happened. Also, some things makes no sense. Near the end of the story they get chased by a dragon. three characters hide in a cave and one keeps running. There is a short moment of romance between two characters, Adventure and Fantasy. First they kiss and everything is fine, then Adventure says something offending and gets kicked out of their shelter. Yes because we all know that remarks like that from someone you just kissed is punishable by death! How does that make sense? Also, Adventure gets INCINIRATED by the dragon but returns to the cave with a cartoonish "flamed" look. How does that make sense? Why run from something that can't harm you? Overall, its a OK movie. If you want a decent adventure movie aimed at children then you will enjoy the Pagemaster.

    A timid boy, frightened of everything, takes shelter in an empty library during a storm. While trying to make a phone call, he slips on the floor and is knocked unconscious. When he comes to, he is an illustration in a land of books, ruled by the mysterious Pagemaster. In order to get home again, he must face perilous adventures with the help of Fantasy, Adventure and Horror. When I was a child and a teenager, many years ago now, books were my best friends. I spent more time in Middle Earth, in nightmare worlds, in the future history of such writers as Heinlein, Asimov and Clarke, and in the worlds of Jules Verne, Lovecraft and Edgar Allan Poe than I did in the world of flesh and blood. Did you ever get so lost in the pages of a book that you were really there? The Pagemaster endeavors to put across this blending of reality and fiction which can only be achieved in the printed word, and while it doesn't completely succeed, it is a charming story and an entertaining family movie. It moves along quickly enough that it doesn't get boring. The mixture of live action and animation fits the story well, in the same way that the use of black and white and color suit The Wizard of Oz. Christopher Lloyd's performance in the early part of the film when he is clearly in love with books and thinks he has found a kindred spirit is brilliant. All in all, not a bad film. I think I prefer something like The Neverending Story (1984, Wolfgang Petersen) for a movie with a similar theme, but this is still fun and worth watching with the whole family.

    First of all, I'd like to point out that I saw this movie just by "accident". I mean, it was only by occasion that I had a chance to watch it and, even though I had not the foggiest idea of what was the movie about, I decided to watch it because I was in the mood of seeing something different. I knew this was an animated movie, but I didn't know it was a combination of live-action and animation. That was a big surprise when I started watching the movie. But even before that I was surprised when I looked at the opening credits because there was a list of famous actors, such as the legendary and unforgettable Macaulay Culkin, Cristopher Lloyd, Whoopi Goldberg and Patrick Stewart. I was delighted because it stars the great Macaulay Culkin. The story introduces Richard Tyler (portrayed by Macaulay Culkin), an intellectual boy obsessed and concerned about statistics of nearly everything. He lives with his parents but seems to be a lonely boy with practically no friends. That and his obsession for statistics worries his parents. When he goes to a library, he meets an eccentric librarian, Mr. Dewey (played by Cristopher Lloyd), who believes Richard is desperate for a book about a fantasy world with adventure, danger, darkness, dragons and so on. After that, Richard sees a spectacular roof painted with strange characters and fantastic creatures. Then he accidentally slips on some water and falls down unconscious. What's next? Well, Richard and everything around him is transformed into illustrations. Richard lives great dangers and adventures in a world of fantasy and horror, including being swallowed by a enormous fire-breathing dragon. The movie starts very well and (I've gotta admit this) it has some spectacular and very creative special effects in the library. Next, the movie becomes animated, but not for good. While the animation is good, I can't say the same about the rest. The designs/drawings, sceneries, picture quality and artwork in general are nothing but dreadful. That fantasy world is a horrible place. The animated characters themselves are, most of them, very ugly. The illustrated Richard looks good and similar to Macaulay Culkin and the giant dragon looks absolutely amazing, but the rest of the characters are too much and annoying, especially those animated books: Adventure (a pirate-like book), Fantasy (a fairy-tale shaped book) and Horror (a horrific-looking book). Through great part of the movie, I found similarities and common elements to other movies and stories. Where do I begin? The tree-house idea comes from "Home Alone". The fact that Macaulay Culkin wears glasses here is a similarity to his character from "My Girl". A treasure island and the one-legged pirate Long John Silver comes directly from "Treasure Island". There are also elements from "Peter Pan" and "Moby Dick". But that's not all: common elements with "Jack and the Beanstalk", "Harry Potter", "The Lord of the Rings", "The Black Cauldron", "Sleeping Beauty", "Ghost Busters" and even with Asian anime cartoons are another reality. Some similarities with "The NeverEnding Story" can be found either. In the fantasy world, Richard is sent to a quest to face his fears. Another good example is the fact that he goes to a library (in this case, in the live-action world) and meets an eccentric librarian who tells him about strange and fantastic stories. Another similarity is that Richard gets angry in the end, for all they made him been through. Back to real life and the live-action world, Richard is still unconscious but when he wakes up, he seems to become a stronger boy and more ready to face life's problems. A good movie? Definitely not for me. Like I said, it starts very well and promising, but turns out to be a major disappointment when it becomes animated. Its combination of so many stories doesn't work well and its artwork is really terrible. The movie is also extremely dark, like "The Black Cauldron" and "The Lord of the Rings", for example, which doesn't help either. Overall, a good movie for kids, but for adults I'm not so sure. It all depends on each person's tastes. At least Macaulay Culkin deserves credit for his performance. He might have messed up his life later, but he always proved to be an excellent actor. This was one of his last movies and may have been an attempt to do something different, but turned out to be unsuccessful.

    Why is the movie telling kids to read more? Wouldn't that hurt your movie profit if all the children are reading books rather than watching your mediocre movie? I guess, I know why this movie bomb when it came out. Still, to me, personally. This movie isn't half bad. It's pretty OK to me. Take a look, it's in a book! Reading rainbow starts out, oops I meant, Page master starts out with ten year old Richard Tyler (Macaulay Culkin) who fears everything. By everything, I meant everything. He doesn't seem like not a real life character anyways due to his overused of statistics and encyclopedia size facts that come out of nowhere. I don't know why the movie choice Richard to be the main character, because he's probably had read some kind of book before. He had to get find those facts somewhere. He's already a book worm, but the movie is making him look like he never read a book before. One day, Richard gets caught in a harsh thunderstorm on a bike trip and takes shelter in a library. Here, he is met by Mr. Dewey (Christopher Lloyd), an eccentric librarian who tries to find a book for Richard and gives him a library card. Christopher Lloyd over acts and is somewhat creepy in this scene. Richard wanders off and finds a large rotunda painted with classic fictional characters that he supposing don't know of. Richard slips on some water that had dripped from his coat and falls down, hitting his head and knocking him unconscious. He awakens and finds the rotunda paintings melting, forming a wave of color that transforms him and the library into illustrations. This is where Director Jon Johnston ends, and directors of the animation parts, Pixote Hunt and Glenn Chaika start. Richard is approached by the Pagemaster (Also Christopher Lloyd) who sends him on a journey into the fiction section to find the "exit". It's funny how the Page Master puts Richard in life threating danger just to prove a point that he has courage in him. It's like putting a young baby in a lion cage and tell it to grow up. It's not like reading will make you brave, anyways. Only survivoring through those life threating events can do that. Reading about interesting characters in books isn't truly living, folks. Being a interesting character in real life and living through something is truly living. Along the way, Richard befriends three anthropomorphic books: Adventure (Patrick Stewart), a swashbuckling pirate like book; Fantasy (Whoopi Goldberg), a sassy but caring fairy tale book; and Horror (Frank Welker), a fearful "hunchbook" with a misshapen spine. I'm surprise that Sci-Fiction wasn't part of the group since a lot of children, I know. Read that. I guess nobody heard of that genre in Richard's world. At less, they didn't jump into young adult novels like Twilight. That would be horrible. The three agree to help Richard to find his way out if he checks them out with his library card. Together, the quartet encounter classic fictional characters and worlds on their way to the exit. I like how they try to put as much literature works into the film, but I have to question that most of the works they did put in, aren't technically for children. Example: the Hounds of Baskervilles has one of the hardest reading levels of all, due to its large amount of vocabulary, use of the English language, and large amounts of geographic and science facts. Not only that, it has a large amount of drug use, sex, and violence that isn't suite for children. Moby Dick wasn't written for children at all as well due to Melville employs stylized language, symbolism, slang language and the metaphor to explore numerous complex themes that would be way too complex for the normal ten year old first time reader. Still I like the fact, that they meet Dr. Jekyll (Leonard Nimoy) from the book Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Then Long John Silver (Jim Cummings) from Treasure Island. It's sad to say that both those classic animation characters are nothing like the literature in which they came from. Example: Dr. Jekyll, for example, isn't creepy and homicidal. He's just a scientist addicted to a potion that frees him from his uptight persona. It's only Mr. Hyde that acts upon crude action. It's ironic and hypocritical that the movie writer tries to use classic literary characters to make kids read books when the writer himself didn't read the books either. The characters were brief and unexplained, but also inaccurate. I do like how the majority of the cast has appeared in some form or another on Star Trek. The animation was pretty well. The paint dragon was badass for when this was made. If you look close, you'll find out that in the worlds are practically everything is made out of books. The rocks, the stairs, the houses. It's a nice little detail which the animators inserted. I love the soundtrack by James Horner. I thought the music in here was fantastic and often use in other film trailers and commercials. I find it weird that a movie is telling children to read, rather than schools or even the parents. I think the best way to get children to read is to turn off the television and read to them. Then allow them to read to you. Simple like that. You don't need this mess. movie to do that.

    The whole makeup of this film is an absolute bore-fest, you might as well sleep through the whole lot because it would be no different if you put the effort in to watch this film. I mean it's meant to be adventurous and epic, but the way it goes about it is enough to make you cringe. On top of that, it features many different characters of famous literature including Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Captain Ahab, The Tiny People of Gullivers Travels and Long John Silver, but the problem with all these cameo's is, it doesn't explain who these people are or why they're famous. They just appear and disappear without a word to the audience of who these people are or what they're known for. Worse still, it features the uselessly bland expression that is McCauley Caulkin, who was the eldest in a line of three brothers who continue to keep up the family tradition of blank emotionless faces and acting that makes you want to cry or question whether or not you have a soul left. The film begins with Richard Tyler, a young nervous bookworm of a boy who lives his life by statistics which means he hasn't the confidence to do fun things like most kids do without scrutinising them endlessly (if I had a child that bland I'd be very worried). Whilst building him a tree-house (which he most likely wont use), his father asks him to get some nails from the hardware store. Whilst on his way, Richard gets lost in a storm and finds his way to an old Library, where Christopher Lloyd is the strange Librarian who wants to enchant Richard into taking out some books from three categories, Horror, Adventure and Fantasy (treating them like they were the only three forms of book in existence, forget Sci-fi and Romantic Comedy, it's looks like there's only three in the world). But Richard only wants to use a phone. Whilst searching for the phone, he slips and falls, knocking himself out. When he comes to, the ceiling begins to drip on him and before long he is engulfed in a huge animated flood that transforms him into an illustration. He is soon confronted by the Pagemaster (a name that sounds dull to begin with, founder of the written word? More like founder of the most boring subject matter award!) He is soon sent off on a voyager (By way of supersonic library cart) and comes across his first booky friend, Adventure, a Scurvy Dog of a Book who wants Richard to check him out of the Library. It's not long before his second friend of the books arrives named Fantasy, a stuck up fairy like book. After escaping the Hounds of the Bascavilles, the trio becomes a quad as they bump into Horror, a simple minded book which is raggedy. Together, the group must find the Exit, but they must first face the various fictional monsters that lie ahead. Will Richard make it home? Will they ever find the Exit? Will Richard ever get his dad's nails? Set your alarm clock for 45 minutes time and you'll find out soon enough... Again, very boring subject matter which has no reference to any of the famous characters that are featured in the movie. There are only three categories of literature that are explored and there is no reference to any other category so for viewers who are not fully embalmed in the world of literacy, they'll only believe that these three categories exist. Big shocker when they bump into Sci-fi, Non-Fiction or Heavily Indulged Romance (I'm talking to you "50 Shades of Grey"). Granted the animation can be quite enjoyable and I really do see that a lot of effort was made into making this film, but if only their time and effort was put into something that wouldn't have viewers snoring away merrily within the first 5 minutes. Good for a watch on a wet Saturday afternoon, but other than that, a real turn off...

The story tells of a young boy named Richard, who is serious and fearful of everything, until an unexpected visit to the library changes his life forever. I loved the story and the clever and diverse references to the literary giants, like Treasure Island, Jekyll and Hyde and Moby Dick, and the message of the film about facing your fears that doesn't preach. Macaulay Culkin is excellent here as is Christopher Lloyd, and Patrick Stewart (rousing and witty), Whoopi Goldberg (sugar and starch) and Frank Welker (in a fine Igor impression) expertly bring the snappy screenplay to life. I loved the witty banter between Adventure and Fantasy, and the librarian's rant about the different literary genres. And I don't think it is Macaulay Culkin or Christopher Lloyd's worst film, Culkin's was Richie Rich, Lloyd's was My Favourite Martian. All in all, a terrific film, with a 10/10. Bethany Cox

    I only review the movies I really adore, some will slip that I don't adore but this one isn't one of them, it seems that over the years people have lost a lot of imagination, it seems as we go through the future we realize what cannot be true is so phony, but as I see it people will return to it one time, I am still a really liker of imagination, but people today don't wanna believe the things that no one can believe, so because of that this movie haven't got a lot of good reviews, I want to do this movie justice... The pagemaster is made for kids and adults who still dreams, it isn't the most serious movie at all but it does have some spots that has deemed it serious, mostly it is a movie that should be taken lightly. This movie wants us to be taught something like many others of its nature, in this movie we are taught two major things first 1. to take choices and not be afraid, to do things we normally would be a afraid of as a child, second 2. it teaches us the main thing, to believe, simply just to believe, we all know none of this is real but why do we have to disband these movies, they are imagination, fantasy something many today could need a whole lot more of. This movie is also done very good by the actors, they chose the right actors for every voice in the movie, but my favorite is of course Christopher Loyd as the Pagemaster, the one who granted a single wish for a kid who were afraid of everything. The music is perfect in this movie, as it is a fantasy music like this is needed, this is something people and companies have at least kept forever and haven't still forgot, now if only they would do the same for fantasy, for imagination, we all have a child in us, why grow up so fast, we get to be mature but that doesn't mean we have to let go the things that made us into what we are today, many of these movies have been forgotten but they will always stay inside us, so now it is time to say that this movie is all that it is a classic, a classic people just forgot. As I said above I only do reviews of movies I like, not movies I don't like so of course this is one of my favorite, I grew up watching movies like this, enjoy it, and for do yourself a favor and watch it again, slowly fall inside imagination, just one more time, it is worth it...

    The story is OK, considering its for the younger generation or meant as a family movie. About the technical part, very well animated, pretty decent camera angles but a little poorly edited. This movie could've been a little longer. After about 26 minutes in begins to jump between stories and does so way to much and way to fast. Going from the Raven (short reference), Dr. Jeckyl and Mr Hyde, Moby Dick to Long John Silver. in a matter of 10 minutes. Also there is a sequence where two of the characters are presumed dead but you don't get a pause or anything. Allow the audience to savor the narrative and feel something about whats just happened. Also, some things makes no sense. Near the end of the story they get chased by a dragon. three characters hide in a cave and one keeps running. There is a short moment of romance between two characters, Adventure and Fantasy. First they kiss and everything is fine, then Adventure says something offending and gets kicked out of their shelter. Yes because we all know that remarks like that from someone you just kissed is punishable by death! How does that make sense? Also, Adventure gets INCINIRATED by the dragon but returns to the cave with a cartoonish "flamed" look. How does that make sense? Why run from something that can't harm you? Overall, its a OK movie. If you want a decent adventure movie aimed at children then you will enjoy the Pagemaster.

    A timid boy, frightened of everything, takes shelter in an empty library during a storm. While trying to make a phone call, he slips on the floor and is knocked unconscious. When he comes to, he is an illustration in a land of books, ruled by the mysterious Pagemaster. In order to get home again, he must face perilous adventures with the help of Fantasy, Adventure and Horror. When I was a child and a teenager, many years ago now, books were my best friends. I spent more time in Middle Earth, in nightmare worlds, in the future history of such writers as Heinlein, Asimov and Clarke, and in the worlds of Jules Verne, Lovecraft and Edgar Allan Poe than I did in the world of flesh and blood. Did you ever get so lost in the pages of a book that you were really there? The Pagemaster endeavors to put across this blending of reality and fiction which can only be achieved in the printed word, and while it doesn't completely succeed, it is a charming story and an entertaining family movie. It moves along quickly enough that it doesn't get boring. The mixture of live action and animation fits the story well, in the same way that the use of black and white and color suit The Wizard of Oz. Christopher Lloyd's performance in the early part of the film when he is clearly in love with books and thinks he has found a kindred spirit is brilliant. All in all, not a bad film. I think I prefer something like The Neverending Story (1984, Wolfgang Petersen) for a movie with a similar theme, but this is still fun and worth watching with the whole family.

    First of all, I'd like to point out that I saw this movie just by "accident". I mean, it was only by occasion that I had a chance to watch it and, even though I had not the foggiest idea of what was the movie about, I decided to watch it because I was in the mood of seeing something different. I knew this was an animated movie, but I didn't know it was a combination of live-action and animation. That was a big surprise when I started watching the movie. But even before that I was surprised when I looked at the opening credits because there was a list of famous actors, such as the legendary and unforgettable Macaulay Culkin, Cristopher Lloyd, Whoopi Goldberg and Patrick Stewart. I was delighted because it stars the great Macaulay Culkin. The story introduces Richard Tyler (portrayed by Macaulay Culkin), an intellectual boy obsessed and concerned about statistics of nearly everything. He lives with his parents but seems to be a lonely boy with practically no friends. That and his obsession for statistics worries his parents. When he goes to a library, he meets an eccentric librarian, Mr. Dewey (played by Cristopher Lloyd), who believes Richard is desperate for a book about a fantasy world with adventure, danger, darkness, dragons and so on. After that, Richard sees a spectacular roof painted with strange characters and fantastic creatures. Then he accidentally slips on some water and falls down unconscious. What's next? Well, Richard and everything around him is transformed into illustrations. Richard lives great dangers and adventures in a world of fantasy and horror, including being swallowed by a enormous fire-breathing dragon. The movie starts very well and (I've gotta admit this) it has some spectacular and very creative special effects in the library. Next, the movie becomes animated, but not for good. While the animation is good, I can't say the same about the rest. The designs/drawings, sceneries, picture quality and artwork in general are nothing but dreadful. That fantasy world is a horrible place. The animated characters themselves are, most of them, very ugly. The illustrated Richard looks good and similar to Macaulay Culkin and the giant dragon looks absolutely amazing, but the rest of the characters are too much and annoying, especially those animated books: Adventure (a pirate-like book), Fantasy (a fairy-tale shaped book) and Horror (a horrific-looking book). Through great part of the movie, I found similarities and common elements to other movies and stories. Where do I begin? The tree-house idea comes from "Home Alone". The fact that Macaulay Culkin wears glasses here is a similarity to his character from "My Girl". A treasure island and the one-legged pirate Long John Silver comes directly from "Treasure Island". There are also elements from "Peter Pan" and "Moby Dick". But that's not all: common elements with "Jack and the Beanstalk", "Harry Potter", "The Lord of the Rings", "The Black Cauldron", "Sleeping Beauty", "Ghost Busters" and even with Asian anime cartoons are another reality. Some similarities with "The NeverEnding Story" can be found either. In the fantasy world, Richard is sent to a quest to face his fears. Another good example is the fact that he goes to a library (in this case, in the live-action world) and meets an eccentric librarian who tells him about strange and fantastic stories. Another similarity is that Richard gets angry in the end, for all they made him been through. Back to real life and the live-action world, Richard is still unconscious but when he wakes up, he seems to become a stronger boy and more ready to face life's problems. A good movie? Definitely not for me. Like I said, it starts very well and promising, but turns out to be a major disappointment when it becomes animated. Its combination of so many stories doesn't work well and its artwork is really terrible. The movie is also extremely dark, like "The Black Cauldron" and "The Lord of the Rings", for example, which doesn't help either. Overall, a good movie for kids, but for adults I'm not so sure. It all depends on each person's tastes. At least Macaulay Culkin deserves credit for his performance. He might have messed up his life later, but he always proved to be an excellent actor. This was one of his last movies and may have been an attempt to do something different, but turned out to be unsuccessful.
