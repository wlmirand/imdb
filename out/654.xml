  A private detective hired to expose an adulterer finds himself caught up in a web of deceit, corruption and murder.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  JJ 'Jake' Gittes is a private detective who seems to specialize in matrimonial cases. He is hired by Evelyn Mulwray when she suspects her husband Hollis, builder of the city's water supply system, of having an affair. Gittes does what he does best and photographs him with a young girl but in the ensuing scandal, it seems he was hired by an impersonator and not the real Mrs. Mulwray. When Mr. Mulwray is found dead, Jake is plunged into a complex web of deceit involving murder, incest and municipal corruption all related to the city's water supply.

    After masterpieces like "Knife in the water", "Repulsion" and "Rosemary's Baby". Roman Polanski (one of the best directors who ever lived, and lives), proved to be a competent director and screenwriter in various genres, decided to make a tribute to the genre that he grew up watching, "Noir", in the best way possible. Doing in my opinion his ultimate masterpiece! "Chinatown" tells the story of J.J. "Jake" Gittes (Jack Nicholson), a private detective in L.A., specialized in cases of marriage. One day, he is hired by Evelyn Mulwray, who suspect's of her husband Hollis Mulwray (Darrell Zwerling), the builder of the water supply system of the city, thinking that he is having an affair. Jake then does what he does best with his assistants and follows and takes photos of Hollis with his young lover, inadvertently causing a huge scandal in the press. Later after a job well done, Jake gets into his office the real Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) putting a process in Jake accusing him of fraud. Jake knowing that he was set-up, he begins to investigate who was the fake Mrs. Mulwray, and trying to get in touch with Hollis Mulwray, because he believe that who cheated him wanted to hurt Mr. Mulwray. Only when Jake tries to contact Mulwray, he is found dead in a channeling of the water system of the city. Now Jake asks the help of the real Mrs. Mulwray to help him in his investigation of those responsible for the death of the poor man, but this will take him into a web of lies and corruption, keeping horrible secrets of the city. Polanski from the beginning wanted to do a tribute to the films noir of the '40s and '50s, and he did it "perfectly". First unite the types of cases and scandals of a usual noir film: policy; familial cases; xenophobia and racism; corruption; and of course murder. Mixing humor, and also dark and thrilling moments to the history. Thanks to a superb direction of Polanski, and also the strongest point of the film (and surprisingly the only Oscar that the film received), the script. The script by Robert Towne, who was initially written by Polanski, is superb in every possible detail. Very well written from start to finish, giving the film a wonderful narrative that flows perfectly without ever getting boring and also, thanks to the influence of Polanski, is full of humor. But it also never ceases to be serious and dark when needs to be, giving superb dialogs to the film, adding a lot to the history. Not only long conversations about the case, but also on the definition of what is justice, spread all over the film. Jake before he was a private detective, he was a police officer in Chinatown, and saw many terrible things. And he says in a moment in the film that justice doesn't exist, only we can make-it. Not only the script and direction that construct the film excellently, but also the magnificent actors. Jack Nicholson at the beginning of his career is definitely superb, from start to finish with his huge smile and his angry face, opening a huge future in front of him; Faye Dunaway simply wonderful, she is the mixture of all the heroines of a Noir film, and mature fragile; even Polanski with a small and dark appearance. Polanski, at its best, making an incredible tribute to the Noir genre (perhaps the best Noir movie ever made) with a superb script, beautiful direction, excellent performances, a story that leaves you intrigued and drag you to the end with laughs and chills, and after the end even tears. 10/10

    The movie is by far one of the best, or may be the best mystery thriller I've enjoyed watching. It has a decent run time of 130 minutes. It possesses one of the most dreadful and baffled story lines. The concept of a detective chasing down a murderer is unvaried, yet this one seems a lot superior to the others. Being many characters involved, it becomes very challenging for the audience to predict the culprit. However, the climax throws me for a loop. The cast was extra-ordinary. The script of the movie was written by the writer, Robert Towne keeping Jack Nicholson in his mind. And, the legend didn't let us down, gave such a splendid and natural performance which won him an Oscar nomination for the best actor in a leading role. The female lead Faye Dunaway did an exceptional job, she was spot on with her expressions and her casualness. John Huston as Noah Cross and Perry Lopez as Escobar too were appreciable. The director, Roman Polanksi who also played a minor supporting role in the movie, deserves to be eulogized. The movie has been drawn out in such a way, which guarantees utmost satisfaction to the viewers. The background score by Jerry Goldsmith too had no problem whatsoever. The movie is highly recommended to the viewers who find solace in watching the movies relevant to the genres of mystery, thriller and crime.

    Bolstered by strong performances from its leading cast, brilliant script by Robert Towne and taut direction by Roman Polanski, Chinatown is one of the best offerings of the mystery genre. Jack Nicholson stars as private detective, J J Gittes and gives a really composed performance and is literally present in every single scene in this film. Faye Dunaway as Evelyn Mulwray puts up another strong performance to go neck to neck with Nicholson's work. But the real star of this film is its script & direction as Polanski's steady work behind the camera & Towne's sturdy script are works of pure craftsmanship and carries no complains. An engaging drama promising a lot of surprises & uncertainty throughout its runtime which finally ends with a soul-shattering climaxÂ… that's Chinatown for you.

    "You may think you know what you're dealing with, but, believe me, you don't." Sometimes things are bigger than ourselves, and despite how much we think we can change the world eventually we are brought down to our reality: we are much smaller than we think we are and there is little we can do against the big corporate giants. That is the main theme that director, Roman Polanski, is trying to explore here in this criminal film noir thriller starring Jack Nicholson as a wise and overly confident private detective who is about to learn that despite how much he wants to teach the bad guys a lesson perhaps things are a little out of his league. That is why the film is titled Chinatown, because it represents a time in Jake's (Nicholson's character) life where he wasn't able to make a difference in the police force and became cynical towards the world. "Forget it, Jake, it's Chinatown" is what they told him, and that is why he decided to retire and become a private investigator working on his own. He doesn't want to forget it, he wants to catch the bad guys and balance things out. He doesn't want these rich executives to continue thinking they can get away with anything. That is exactly why he decides to investigate things on his own and begins to enter dangerous territory where not everyone is who they say they are. He slowly begins to uncover one lie after another, and that is what makes Chinatown such an entertaining and masterful thriller. We are part of the investigation and begin discovering things at the same time Jake does. We are as confident as he is that he is going to uncover everything. This is Jack Nicholson's movie from the opening scene and he delivers one of his best performances to date. Faye Dunaway is also interesting in her femme fatale role; we are never sure if we can trust her or not. Polanski has delivered a perfect homage to the 40's film noir thrillers. Chinatown will remain as one of the best classical films of all time. This is my favorite Polanski film, perfect in every way. Jake Gittes seems to be doing well as a private detective in Los Angeles, since he specializes in infidelities and there are many in the city. His latest assignment is to follow Evelyn Mulwray's (Diane Ladd) husband who happens to be the builder of the city's water supply system. His name is Hollis (Darrell Zwerling) and he is fascinated with everything that has to do with water, but Evelyn is convinced he is having an affair. Jake accepts the job and begins following Hollis, and surely enough he photographs him with a younger woman causing a scandal in the city. Jake believes his job is done, until a Mrs. Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) comes thundering into his office claiming that she had never hired him to follow her husband. Apparently the first woman claiming to be Mrs. Mulwray was only an impersonator and now Jake has a law suit in his hands. Surprisingly Mrs. Mulwray drops the law suit a few days later, and her husband is found dead after an apparent suicide. Jake is now hired by Mrs. Mulwray to discover who might have wanted her husband dead, and soon Jake will find himself uncovering an entire web of deceit and corruption that is much bigger than he thinks. This masterful film was nominated for 11 Academy Awards, but only won one (Best Original Screenplay written by Robert Towne) considering it had to compete in 1975 with another perfect film: The Godfather Part II. One of the best things about Chinatown actually is the screenplay. There are so many great dialogues and quotes from this film that are still remembered today almost 40 years later. Chinatown is exactly what a classical film looks like. Polanski created a masterpiece by recreating the classic film noir from the 40's with great art direction, costume designs, and cinematography. The editing and the original score are also done wonderfully, but none of this would be enough if it weren't for the wonderful performances from Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway. Chinatown deserves all the praise it has received over time and it has really turned into a timeless classic and one of the few that continues to astonish modern audiences. The twists and surprises in Chinatown continue to work today.

    What a fantastic crime thriller from Roman Polanski. Chinatown is superbly acted, very stylish and contains a mysterious story that will keep you enthralled until the end. There are several shocking and disturbing moments, which were delivered quite effectively throughout the film. The score is done pretty well and helps propelling the intensity in a lot of scenes. I was constantly entertained and intrigued by Jack Nicholson's character as he's a sarcastic, witty and persistent detective. Faye Dunaway and John Huston are other highlights and delivered excellent performances as well. I was really moved by its haunting ending and shocked by the main twist presented earlier in the film. Chinatown is certainly one of the best American noirs ever made and I highly recommend it.

    The Los Angeles District Attorney tells cops in Chinatown to do "as little as possible." When detective Jake Gittes was on that beat, the DA used to tell him "you may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't." There isn't much doubt about what happened to Jake in Chinatown back then. Trying to prevent it from happening, he explains, had only assured that it would. It would have been better to have done nothing at all. He gives that advice to at least one prospective patron of his private eye business when she comes to him with a concern about her cheating husband. "Go home and forget everything," he says, and for once this sarcastic, confident, inquisitive detective seems sincere and tired and sad. This line of work is how he makes his living, but he isn't out to see anyone get hurt. He takes the case, of course, and follows it where it leads, which is to a place where he can do nothing to prevent those who know too little from doing too much. Maybe he should have just gone home and forgotten everything, but then we wouldn't have Robert Towne's deft, classic screenplay.

    As I wrote the title to this post, the year "1974" flashed before my eyes in terms of my opinion of the highly respected film Chinatown. I've now seen this film twice, the first time I "convinced" myself it to love it no matter what I actually thought of it, knowing how highly regarded screenplay is in the movie industry. Honestly, I felt the film's pacing was a dud and Nicholson didn't work as the leading character. The screenplay was fine, but I felt like I was going to drown in my own saliva from falling asleep in this boring movie. I rewatched the film knowing where the story is going and having a firm grip on the plot and came out drinking the Chinatown cool-aid. My most substantial complaints of my first viewing of Chinatown, pacing aside, was the disappointment I felt in Jack Nicholson's performance. I before thought he was playing himself as a detective. Jack Nicholson the Detective, not J.J. Gittes, which is frustrating and awkward to watch. On second viewing, I took to Nicholson's performance more, he's serviceable with a few moments of finesse. When Nicholson is put in "hammy" scenes, I feel like it's only Jack Nicholson that appears most times. Maybe that's why his work in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is the best work of his career. He gets to play the eccentric character that he is in real life. Faye Dunaway emerges as the heroine grounded in mystery. Her character has layers that Dunaway is allowed to slowly peal off, each layer making sense from what we know about the layer prior. Chinatown is essentially a neo-film noir of its time, and Dunaway fits the bill of a noir heroine to a tee. Set in the 1930s, Chiantown features some wonderful costumes, sets, and cinematography that add to that era and the noir-feeling of the picture. The film score helps the picture set its wonderful tone, also. Roman Polanski is the man I have any kind of a beef with when it comes to Chinatown. Polanski excels at creating the rush for viewers in the second half of the film, but Chinatown's blinding flaw is that the first hour, Polanski lets the picture flat-line. The information we're given in the first hour makes sense at the end of the movie, we need to see these crucial scenes, but Polanski doesn't help make these overreaching plot arc scenes lively enough to keep me interested. The first hour succeeds on all levels, with the huge exception of the lackadaisical directing. The second half, Polanski shifts the film into drive, stomps on the gas petal and makes amends for the first hour's glacial pacing. Finally, what makes Chinatown "Chinatown".....the marvelous screenplay. Robert Towney penned the screenplay, which revived the noir-genre in the 1970s. Not only that, but Towney scribed a manicured script that had thick character development and a serpentine plot that keeps unfolding in your mind even after the movie has concluded. People probably confuse themselves searching for the allegory to bigger things in Chinatown's script, however, literary devices aren't why Chinatown is a step above most screenplays ever written. It's brilliant in the communication to the audience, keeping the audience under water in the mysteries (we're introduced to one big mystery to learn about multiple others in solving the one at hand) of Chinatown and the multiples secrets the characters conceal about their past. Chinatown opens its film in a odd fashion and goes against the formula of film noir anatomy with its first twenty minutes. It's very carefully plotted and tricky to comprehend at first. But then a mystery unfolds that's one of the most satisfying and involved conclusions to a mystery story. Filled to the brim with fine performances and wonderful decor, if you're willing to be patient and relinquish your full attention to the plot, Chinatown is a movie that resonates and unrolls in your mind. The more I've thought about the intelligence behind the film, the closer Chinatown is to getting a perfect from me. Rating: 9.5/10 Grade: A

    Almost 40 years later this movie has lost none of its power to affect. It uses the trappings of a fedora-sporting detective (Jack Nicholson), on the trail of a mystery he doesn't realize he does not want to unravel, to tell a drama of a family destroyed by horrific deeds and secrets. The story remains timeless, ultimately, due to its illumination of the best and worst within us - and that enormous valley where most of us, like detective Jake Gittes, fall - somewhere in between. I won't give away any story, but to give you some idea how powerful this is, I was never able to enjoy John Huston acting in a movie ever again because of his portrayal here (Noah Cross). The revelatory scene between Gittes and Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) retains its power to shock and disturb. What makes this so potent, really, is the screenplay by Robert Towne. It's powerful in ways many movies never reach; and maybe no one writes more realistic dialogue than Towne. The unsavory parts of the story are redeemed by the positive we get from Evelyn Mulwray, and her determination to carry on. Although the story doesn't end with her walking away victorious, her perseverance is really the heart of this tale. 20 years earlier this story could never have been told in a Hollywood movie; the excellence of this one movie - "Chinatown" - makes that entire fight to loosen censorship worthwhile.

    What I love about movies that come from the New Hollywood genres is their quality of elegance that make these pictures into something special that cannot be captured ever again. Whether it is the clean look in the visuals or its technique of not going with all the bare details in story or its characters. That certain mystique is especially captured so beautifully in 'Chinatown.' It's a story that pulls you into a big mystery, but ultimately it feels like the town is full of mysteries. One thing I have to say I love is the effectiveness of the title, in that after watching the movie it finally takes on the true colors of what the movie is about and really gives meaning to what is disturbing about what I just witnessed on screen. And I'll leave it at that. I could go on about the acting performances that really give strength to the film. All I could say is that the collaborative effort of the creation of the story, its characters and its atmosphere all culminate in creating a movie that is truly dark and brooding. It's basically a movie that will stick with you. This is probably a horrible review, but I guess I just want to let anyone know who might read this that this is a classic.

    getting ready to watch this movie, I was excited to see how this could go about. I wasn't sure if I'd like the film too much or maybe not at all. I was completely awed. The movie is the extreme mystery. The fact that it ends up as a twist is very powerful. The beautiful scenery of the water was a great way to get a better understanding of Los Angeles. I have seen movies like this, but then again I haven't. So was this a reference movie? It could possibly be one, I am sure. Needless to say, the camera work and the shots of the film were great. I loved the whole storyline of the film. It kept me entertained and kept me wondering where something was gong to pop up and when something else out of the ordinary would pop up.

Jake accepts the job and begins following Hollis, and surely enough he photographs him with a younger woman causing a scandal in the city. Jake believes his job is done, until a Mrs. Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) comes thundering into his office claiming that she had never hired him to follow her husband. Apparently the first woman claiming to be Mrs. Mulwray was only an impersonator and now Jake has a law suit in his hands. Surprisingly Mrs. Mulwray drops the law suit a few days later, and her husband is found dead after an apparent suicide. Jake is now hired by Mrs. Mulwray to discover who might have wanted her husband dead, and soon Jake will find himself uncovering an entire web of deceit and corruption that is much bigger than he thinks. This masterful film was nominated for 11 Academy Awards, but only won one (Best Original Screenplay written by Robert Towne) considering it had to compete in 1975 with another perfect film: The Godfather Part II. One of the best things about Chinatown actually is the screenplay. There are so many great dialogues and quotes from this film that are still remembered today almost 40 years later. Chinatown is exactly what a classical film looks like. Polanski created a masterpiece by recreating the classic film noir from the 40's with great art direction, costume designs, and cinematography. The editing and the original score are also done wonderfully, but none of this would be enough if it weren't for the wonderful performances from Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway. Chinatown deserves all the praise it has received over time and it has really turned into a timeless classic and one of the few that continues to astonish modern audiences. The twists and surprises in Chinatown continue to work today.

    What a fantastic crime thriller from Roman Polanski. Chinatown is superbly acted, very stylish and contains a mysterious story that will keep you enthralled until the end. There are several shocking and disturbing moments, which were delivered quite effectively throughout the film. The score is done pretty well and helps propelling the intensity in a lot of scenes. I was constantly entertained and intrigued by Jack Nicholson's character as he's a sarcastic, witty and persistent detective. Faye Dunaway and John Huston are other highlights and delivered excellent performances as well. I was really moved by its haunting ending and shocked by the main twist presented earlier in the film. Chinatown is certainly one of the best American noirs ever made and I highly recommend it.

    The Los Angeles District Attorney tells cops in Chinatown to do "as little as possible." When detective Jake Gittes was on that beat, the DA used to tell him "you may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't." There isn't much doubt about what happened to Jake in Chinatown back then. Trying to prevent it from happening, he explains, had only assured that it would. It would have been better to have done nothing at all. He gives that advice to at least one prospective patron of his private eye business when she comes to him with a concern about her cheating husband. "Go home and forget everything," he says, and for once this sarcastic, confident, inquisitive detective seems sincere and tired and sad. This line of work is how he makes his living, but he isn't out to see anyone get hurt. He takes the case, of course, and follows it where it leads, which is to a place where he can do nothing to prevent those who know too little from doing too much. Maybe he should have just gone home and forgotten everything, but then we wouldn't have Robert Towne's deft, classic screenplay.

    As I wrote the title to this post, the year "1974" flashed before my eyes in terms of my opinion of the highly respected film Chinatown. I've now seen this film twice, the first time I "convinced" myself it to love it no matter what I actually thought of it, knowing how highly regarded screenplay is in the movie industry. Honestly, I felt the film's pacing was a dud and Nicholson didn't work as the leading character. The screenplay was fine, but I felt like I was going to drown in my own saliva from falling asleep in this boring movie. I rewatched the film knowing where the story is going and having a firm grip on the plot and came out drinking the Chinatown cool-aid. My most substantial complaints of my first viewing of Chinatown, pacing aside, was the disappointment I felt in Jack Nicholson's performance. I before thought he was playing himself as a detective. Jack Nicholson the Detective, not J.J. Gittes, which is frustrating and awkward to watch. On second viewing, I took to Nicholson's performance more, he's serviceable with a few moments of finesse. When Nicholson is put in "hammy" scenes, I feel like it's only Jack Nicholson that appears most times. Maybe that's why his work in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is the best work of his career. He gets to play the eccentric character that he is in real life. Faye Dunaway emerges as the heroine grounded in mystery. Her character has layers that Dunaway is allowed to slowly peal off, each layer making sense from what we know about the layer prior. Chinatown is essentially a neo-film noir of its time, and Dunaway fits the bill of a noir heroine to a tee. Set in the 1930s, Chiantown features some wonderful costumes, sets, and cinematography that add to that era and the noir-feeling of the picture. The film score helps the picture set its wonderful tone, also. Roman Polanski is the man I have any kind of a beef with when it comes to Chinatown. Polanski excels at creating the rush for viewers in the second half of the film, but Chinatown's blinding flaw is that the first hour, Polanski lets the picture flat-line. The information we're given in the first hour makes sense at the end of the movie, we need to see these crucial scenes, but Polanski doesn't help make these overreaching plot arc scenes lively enough to keep me interested. The first hour succeeds on all levels, with the huge exception of the lackadaisical directing. The second half, Polanski shifts the film into drive, stomps on the gas petal and makes amends for the first hour's glacial pacing. Finally, what makes Chinatown "Chinatown".....the marvelous screenplay. Robert Towney penned the screenplay, which revived the noir-genre in the 1970s. Not only that, but Towney scribed a manicured script that had thick character development and a serpentine plot that keeps unfolding in your mind even after the movie has concluded. People probably confuse themselves searching for the allegory to bigger things in Chinatown's script, however, literary devices aren't why Chinatown is a step above most screenplays ever written. It's brilliant in the communication to the audience, keeping the audience under water in the mysteries (we're introduced to one big mystery to learn about multiple others in solving the one at hand) of Chinatown and the multiples secrets the characters conceal about their past. Chinatown opens its film in a odd fashion and goes against the formula of film noir anatomy with its first twenty minutes. It's very carefully plotted and tricky to comprehend at first. But then a mystery unfolds that's one of the most satisfying and involved conclusions to a mystery story. Filled to the brim with fine performances and wonderful decor, if you're willing to be patient and relinquish your full attention to the plot, Chinatown is a movie that resonates and unrolls in your mind. The more I've thought about the intelligence behind the film, the closer Chinatown is to getting a perfect from me. Rating: 9.5/10 Grade: A

    Almost 40 years later this movie has lost none of its power to affect. It uses the trappings of a fedora-sporting detective (Jack Nicholson), on the trail of a mystery he doesn't realize he does not want to unravel, to tell a drama of a family destroyed by horrific deeds and secrets. The story remains timeless, ultimately, due to its illumination of the best and worst within us - and that enormous valley where most of us, like detective Jake Gittes, fall - somewhere in between. I won't give away any story, but to give you some idea how powerful this is, I was never able to enjoy John Huston acting in a movie ever again because of his portrayal here (Noah Cross). The revelatory scene between Gittes and Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) retains its power to shock and disturb. What makes this so potent, really, is the screenplay by Robert Towne. It's powerful in ways many movies never reach; and maybe no one writes more realistic dialogue than Towne. The unsavory parts of the story are redeemed by the positive we get from Evelyn Mulwray, and her determination to carry on. Although the story doesn't end with her walking away victorious, her perseverance is really the heart of this tale. 20 years earlier this story could never have been told in a Hollywood movie; the excellence of this one movie - "Chinatown" - makes that entire fight to loosen censorship worthwhile.

    What I love about movies that come from the New Hollywood genres is their quality of elegance that make these pictures into something special that cannot be captured ever again. Whether it is the clean look in the visuals or its technique of not going with all the bare details in story or its characters. That certain mystique is especially captured so beautifully in 'Chinatown.' It's a story that pulls you into a big mystery, but ultimately it feels like the town is full of mysteries. One thing I have to say I love is the effectiveness of the title, in that after watching the movie it finally takes on the true colors of what the movie is about and really gives meaning to what is disturbing about what I just witnessed on screen. And I'll leave it at that. I could go on about the acting performances that really give strength to the film. All I could say is that the collaborative effort of the creation of the story, its characters and its atmosphere all culminate in creating a movie that is truly dark and brooding. It's basically a movie that will stick with you. This is probably a horrible review, but I guess I just want to let anyone know who might read this that this is a classic.

    getting ready to watch this movie, I was excited to see how this could go about. I wasn't sure if I'd like the film too much or maybe not at all. I was completely awed. The movie is the extreme mystery. The fact that it ends up as a twist is very powerful. The beautiful scenery of the water was a great way to get a better understanding of Los Angeles. I have seen movies like this, but then again I haven't. So was this a reference movie? It could possibly be one, I am sure. Needless to say, the camera work and the shots of the film were great. I loved the whole storyline of the film. It kept me entertained and kept me wondering where something was gong to pop up and when something else out of the ordinary would pop up.

    After masterpieces like "Knife in the water", "Repulsion" and "Rosemary's Baby". Roman Polanski (one of the best directors who ever lived, and lives), proved to be a competent director and screenwriter in various genres, decided to make a tribute to the genre that he grew up watching, "Noir", in the best way possible. Doing in my opinion his ultimate masterpiece! "Chinatown" tells the story of J.J. "Jake" Gittes (Jack Nicholson), a private detective in L.A., specialized in cases of marriage. One day, he is hired by Evelyn Mulwray, who suspect's of her husband Hollis Mulwray (Darrell Zwerling), the builder of the water supply system of the city, thinking that he is having an affair. Jake then does what he does best with his assistants and follows and takes photos of Hollis with his young lover, inadvertently causing a huge scandal in the press. Later after a job well done, Jake gets into his office the real Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) putting a process in Jake accusing him of fraud. Jake knowing that he was set-up, he begins to investigate who was the fake Mrs. Mulwray, and trying to get in touch with Hollis Mulwray, because he believe that who cheated him wanted to hurt Mr. Mulwray. Only when Jake tries to contact Mulwray, he is found dead in a channeling of the water system of the city. Now Jake asks the help of the real Mrs. Mulwray to help him in his investigation of those responsible for the death of the poor man, but this will take him into a web of lies and corruption, keeping horrible secrets of the city. Polanski from the beginning wanted to do a tribute to the films noir of the '40s and '50s, and he did it "perfectly". First unite the types of cases and scandals of a usual noir film: policy; familial cases; xenophobia and racism; corruption; and of course murder. Mixing humor, and also dark and thrilling moments to the history. Thanks to a superb direction of Polanski, and also the strongest point of the film (and surprisingly the only Oscar that the film received), the script. The script by Robert Towne, who was initially written by Polanski, is superb in every possible detail. Very well written from start to finish, giving the film a wonderful narrative that flows perfectly without ever getting boring and also, thanks to the influence of Polanski, is full of humor. But it also never ceases to be serious and dark when needs to be, giving superb dialogs to the film, adding a lot to the history. Not only long conversations about the case, but also on the definition of what is justice, spread all over the film. Jake before he was a private detective, he was a police officer in Chinatown, and saw many terrible things. And he says in a moment in the film that justice doesn't exist, only we can make-it. Not only the script and direction that construct the film excellently, but also the magnificent actors. Jack Nicholson at the beginning of his career is definitely superb, from start to finish with his huge smile and his angry face, opening a huge future in front of him; Faye Dunaway simply wonderful, she is the mixture of all the heroines of a Noir film, and mature fragile; even Polanski with a small and dark appearance. Polanski, at its best, making an incredible tribute to the Noir genre (perhaps the best Noir movie ever made) with a superb script, beautiful direction, excellent performances, a story that leaves you intrigued and drag you to the end with laughs and chills, and after the end even tears. 10/10

    The movie is by far one of the best, or may be the best mystery thriller I've enjoyed watching. It has a decent run time of 130 minutes. It possesses one of the most dreadful and baffled story lines. The concept of a detective chasing down a murderer is unvaried, yet this one seems a lot superior to the others. Being many characters involved, it becomes very challenging for the audience to predict the culprit. However, the climax throws me for a loop. The cast was extra-ordinary. The script of the movie was written by the writer, Robert Towne keeping Jack Nicholson in his mind. And, the legend didn't let us down, gave such a splendid and natural performance which won him an Oscar nomination for the best actor in a leading role. The female lead Faye Dunaway did an exceptional job, she was spot on with her expressions and her casualness. John Huston as Noah Cross and Perry Lopez as Escobar too were appreciable. The director, Roman Polanksi who also played a minor supporting role in the movie, deserves to be eulogized. The movie has been drawn out in such a way, which guarantees utmost satisfaction to the viewers. The background score by Jerry Goldsmith too had no problem whatsoever. The movie is highly recommended to the viewers who find solace in watching the movies relevant to the genres of mystery, thriller and crime.

    Bolstered by strong performances from its leading cast, brilliant script by Robert Towne and taut direction by Roman Polanski, Chinatown is one of the best offerings of the mystery genre. Jack Nicholson stars as private detective, J J Gittes and gives a really composed performance and is literally present in every single scene in this film. Faye Dunaway as Evelyn Mulwray puts up another strong performance to go neck to neck with Nicholson's work. But the real star of this film is its script & direction as Polanski's steady work behind the camera & Towne's sturdy script are works of pure craftsmanship and carries no complains. An engaging drama promising a lot of surprises & uncertainty throughout its runtime which finally ends with a soul-shattering climaxÂ… that's Chinatown for you.

    "You may think you know what you're dealing with, but, believe me, you don't." Sometimes things are bigger than ourselves, and despite how much we think we can change the world eventually we are brought down to our reality: we are much smaller than we think we are and there is little we can do against the big corporate giants. That is the main theme that director, Roman Polanski, is trying to explore here in this criminal film noir thriller starring Jack Nicholson as a wise and overly confident private detective who is about to learn that despite how much he wants to teach the bad guys a lesson perhaps things are a little out of his league. That is why the film is titled Chinatown, because it represents a time in Jake's (Nicholson's character) life where he wasn't able to make a difference in the police force and became cynical towards the world. "Forget it, Jake, it's Chinatown" is what they told him, and that is why he decided to retire and become a private investigator working on his own. He doesn't want to forget it, he wants to catch the bad guys and balance things out. He doesn't want these rich executives to continue thinking they can get away with anything. That is exactly why he decides to investigate things on his own and begins to enter dangerous territory where not everyone is who they say they are. He slowly begins to uncover one lie after another, and that is what makes Chinatown such an entertaining and masterful thriller. We are part of the investigation and begin discovering things at the same time Jake does. We are as confident as he is that he is going to uncover everything. This is Jack Nicholson's movie from the opening scene and he delivers one of his best performances to date. Faye Dunaway is also interesting in her femme fatale role; we are never sure if we can trust her or not. Polanski has delivered a perfect homage to the 40's film noir thrillers. Chinatown will remain as one of the best classical films of all time. This is my favorite Polanski film, perfect in every way. Jake Gittes seems to be doing well as a private detective in Los Angeles, since he specializes in infidelities and there are many in the city. His latest assignment is to follow Evelyn Mulwray's (Diane Ladd) husband who happens to be the builder of the city's water supply system. His name is Hollis (Darrell Zwerling) and he is fascinated with everything that has to do with water, but Evelyn is convinced he is having an affair. Jake accepts the job and begins following Hollis, and surely enough he photographs him with a younger woman causing a scandal in the city. Jake believes his job is done, until a Mrs. Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) comes thundering into his office claiming that she had never hired him to follow her husband. Apparently the first woman claiming to be Mrs. Mulwray was only an impersonator and now Jake has a law suit in his hands. Surprisingly Mrs. Mulwray drops the law suit a few days later, and her husband is found dead after an apparent suicide. Jake is now hired by Mrs. Mulwray to discover who might have wanted her husband dead, and soon Jake will find himself uncovering an entire web of deceit and corruption that is much bigger than he thinks. This masterful film was nominated for 11 Academy Awards, but only won one (Best Original Screenplay written by Robert Towne) considering it had to compete in 1975 with another perfect film: The Godfather Part II.

All I could say is that the collaborative effort of the creation of the story, its characters and its atmosphere all culminate in creating a movie that is truly dark and brooding. It's basically a movie that will stick with you. This is probably a horrible review, but I guess I just want to let anyone know who might read this that this is a classic.

    getting ready to watch this movie, I was excited to see how this could go about. I wasn't sure if I'd like the film too much or maybe not at all. I was completely awed. The movie is the extreme mystery. The fact that it ends up as a twist is very powerful. The beautiful scenery of the water was a great way to get a better understanding of Los Angeles. I have seen movies like this, but then again I haven't. So was this a reference movie? It could possibly be one, I am sure. Needless to say, the camera work and the shots of the film were great. I loved the whole storyline of the film. It kept me entertained and kept me wondering where something was gong to pop up and when something else out of the ordinary would pop up.

    After masterpieces like "Knife in the water", "Repulsion" and "Rosemary's Baby". Roman Polanski (one of the best directors who ever lived, and lives), proved to be a competent director and screenwriter in various genres, decided to make a tribute to the genre that he grew up watching, "Noir", in the best way possible. Doing in my opinion his ultimate masterpiece! "Chinatown" tells the story of J.J. "Jake" Gittes (Jack Nicholson), a private detective in L.A., specialized in cases of marriage. One day, he is hired by Evelyn Mulwray, who suspect's of her husband Hollis Mulwray (Darrell Zwerling), the builder of the water supply system of the city, thinking that he is having an affair. Jake then does what he does best with his assistants and follows and takes photos of Hollis with his young lover, inadvertently causing a huge scandal in the press. Later after a job well done, Jake gets into his office the real Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) putting a process in Jake accusing him of fraud. Jake knowing that he was set-up, he begins to investigate who was the fake Mrs. Mulwray, and trying to get in touch with Hollis Mulwray, because he believe that who cheated him wanted to hurt Mr. Mulwray. Only when Jake tries to contact Mulwray, he is found dead in a channeling of the water system of the city. Now Jake asks the help of the real Mrs. Mulwray to help him in his investigation of those responsible for the death of the poor man, but this will take him into a web of lies and corruption, keeping horrible secrets of the city. Polanski from the beginning wanted to do a tribute to the films noir of the '40s and '50s, and he did it "perfectly". First unite the types of cases and scandals of a usual noir film: policy; familial cases; xenophobia and racism; corruption; and of course murder. Mixing humor, and also dark and thrilling moments to the history. Thanks to a superb direction of Polanski, and also the strongest point of the film (and surprisingly the only Oscar that the film received), the script. The script by Robert Towne, who was initially written by Polanski, is superb in every possible detail. Very well written from start to finish, giving the film a wonderful narrative that flows perfectly without ever getting boring and also, thanks to the influence of Polanski, is full of humor. But it also never ceases to be serious and dark when needs to be, giving superb dialogs to the film, adding a lot to the history. Not only long conversations about the case, but also on the definition of what is justice, spread all over the film. Jake before he was a private detective, he was a police officer in Chinatown, and saw many terrible things. And he says in a moment in the film that justice doesn't exist, only we can make-it. Not only the script and direction that construct the film excellently, but also the magnificent actors. Jack Nicholson at the beginning of his career is definitely superb, from start to finish with his huge smile and his angry face, opening a huge future in front of him; Faye Dunaway simply wonderful, she is the mixture of all the heroines of a Noir film, and mature fragile; even Polanski with a small and dark appearance. Polanski, at its best, making an incredible tribute to the Noir genre (perhaps the best Noir movie ever made) with a superb script, beautiful direction, excellent performances, a story that leaves you intrigued and drag you to the end with laughs and chills, and after the end even tears. 10/10

    The movie is by far one of the best, or may be the best mystery thriller I've enjoyed watching. It has a decent run time of 130 minutes. It possesses one of the most dreadful and baffled story lines. The concept of a detective chasing down a murderer is unvaried, yet this one seems a lot superior to the others. Being many characters involved, it becomes very challenging for the audience to predict the culprit. However, the climax throws me for a loop. The cast was extra-ordinary. The script of the movie was written by the writer, Robert Towne keeping Jack Nicholson in his mind. And, the legend didn't let us down, gave such a splendid and natural performance which won him an Oscar nomination for the best actor in a leading role. The female lead Faye Dunaway did an exceptional job, she was spot on with her expressions and her casualness. John Huston as Noah Cross and Perry Lopez as Escobar too were appreciable. The director, Roman Polanksi who also played a minor supporting role in the movie, deserves to be eulogized. The movie has been drawn out in such a way, which guarantees utmost satisfaction to the viewers. The background score by Jerry Goldsmith too had no problem whatsoever. The movie is highly recommended to the viewers who find solace in watching the movies relevant to the genres of mystery, thriller and crime.

    Bolstered by strong performances from its leading cast, brilliant script by Robert Towne and taut direction by Roman Polanski, Chinatown is one of the best offerings of the mystery genre. Jack Nicholson stars as private detective, J J Gittes and gives a really composed performance and is literally present in every single scene in this film. Faye Dunaway as Evelyn Mulwray puts up another strong performance to go neck to neck with Nicholson's work. But the real star of this film is its script & direction as Polanski's steady work behind the camera & Towne's sturdy script are works of pure craftsmanship and carries no complains. An engaging drama promising a lot of surprises & uncertainty throughout its runtime which finally ends with a soul-shattering climaxÂ… that's Chinatown for you.

    "You may think you know what you're dealing with, but, believe me, you don't." Sometimes things are bigger than ourselves, and despite how much we think we can change the world eventually we are brought down to our reality: we are much smaller than we think we are and there is little we can do against the big corporate giants. That is the main theme that director, Roman Polanski, is trying to explore here in this criminal film noir thriller starring Jack Nicholson as a wise and overly confident private detective who is about to learn that despite how much he wants to teach the bad guys a lesson perhaps things are a little out of his league. That is why the film is titled Chinatown, because it represents a time in Jake's (Nicholson's character) life where he wasn't able to make a difference in the police force and became cynical towards the world. "Forget it, Jake, it's Chinatown" is what they told him, and that is why he decided to retire and become a private investigator working on his own. He doesn't want to forget it, he wants to catch the bad guys and balance things out. He doesn't want these rich executives to continue thinking they can get away with anything. That is exactly why he decides to investigate things on his own and begins to enter dangerous territory where not everyone is who they say they are. He slowly begins to uncover one lie after another, and that is what makes Chinatown such an entertaining and masterful thriller. We are part of the investigation and begin discovering things at the same time Jake does. We are as confident as he is that he is going to uncover everything. This is Jack Nicholson's movie from the opening scene and he delivers one of his best performances to date. Faye Dunaway is also interesting in her femme fatale role; we are never sure if we can trust her or not. Polanski has delivered a perfect homage to the 40's film noir thrillers. Chinatown will remain as one of the best classical films of all time. This is my favorite Polanski film, perfect in every way. Jake Gittes seems to be doing well as a private detective in Los Angeles, since he specializes in infidelities and there are many in the city. His latest assignment is to follow Evelyn Mulwray's (Diane Ladd) husband who happens to be the builder of the city's water supply system. His name is Hollis (Darrell Zwerling) and he is fascinated with everything that has to do with water, but Evelyn is convinced he is having an affair. Jake accepts the job and begins following Hollis, and surely enough he photographs him with a younger woman causing a scandal in the city. Jake believes his job is done, until a Mrs. Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) comes thundering into his office claiming that she had never hired him to follow her husband. Apparently the first woman claiming to be Mrs. Mulwray was only an impersonator and now Jake has a law suit in his hands. Surprisingly Mrs. Mulwray drops the law suit a few days later, and her husband is found dead after an apparent suicide. Jake is now hired by Mrs. Mulwray to discover who might have wanted her husband dead, and soon Jake will find himself uncovering an entire web of deceit and corruption that is much bigger than he thinks. This masterful film was nominated for 11 Academy Awards, but only won one (Best Original Screenplay written by Robert Towne) considering it had to compete in 1975 with another perfect film: The Godfather Part II. One of the best things about Chinatown actually is the screenplay. There are so many great dialogues and quotes from this film that are still remembered today almost 40 years later. Chinatown is exactly what a classical film looks like. Polanski created a masterpiece by recreating the classic film noir from the 40's with great art direction, costume designs, and cinematography. The editing and the original score are also done wonderfully, but none of this would be enough if it weren't for the wonderful performances from Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway. Chinatown deserves all the praise it has received over time and it has really turned into a timeless classic and one of the few that continues to astonish modern audiences. The twists and surprises in Chinatown continue to work today.

    What a fantastic crime thriller from Roman Polanski. Chinatown is superbly acted, very stylish and contains a mysterious story that will keep you enthralled until the end. There are several shocking and disturbing moments, which were delivered quite effectively throughout the film. The score is done pretty well and helps propelling the intensity in a lot of scenes. I was constantly entertained and intrigued by Jack Nicholson's character as he's a sarcastic, witty and persistent detective. Faye Dunaway and John Huston are other highlights and delivered excellent performances as well. I was really moved by its haunting ending and shocked by the main twist presented earlier in the film. Chinatown is certainly one of the best American noirs ever made and I highly recommend it.

    The Los Angeles District Attorney tells cops in Chinatown to do "as little as possible." When detective Jake Gittes was on that beat, the DA used to tell him "you may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't." There isn't much doubt about what happened to Jake in Chinatown back then. Trying to prevent it from happening, he explains, had only assured that it would. It would have been better to have done nothing at all. He gives that advice to at least one prospective patron of his private eye business when she comes to him with a concern about her cheating husband. "Go home and forget everything," he says, and for once this sarcastic, confident, inquisitive detective seems sincere and tired and sad. This line of work is how he makes his living, but he isn't out to see anyone get hurt. He takes the case, of course, and follows it where it leads, which is to a place where he can do nothing to prevent those who know too little from doing too much. Maybe he should have just gone home and forgotten everything, but then we wouldn't have Robert Towne's deft, classic screenplay.

    As I wrote the title to this post, the year "1974" flashed before my eyes in terms of my opinion of the highly respected film Chinatown. I've now seen this film twice, the first time I "convinced" myself it to love it no matter what I actually thought of it, knowing how highly regarded screenplay is in the movie industry. Honestly, I felt the film's pacing was a dud and Nicholson didn't work as the leading character. The screenplay was fine, but I felt like I was going to drown in my own saliva from falling asleep in this boring movie. I rewatched the film knowing where the story is going and having a firm grip on the plot and came out drinking the Chinatown cool-aid. My most substantial complaints of my first viewing of Chinatown, pacing aside, was the disappointment I felt in Jack Nicholson's performance. I before thought he was playing himself as a detective. Jack Nicholson the Detective, not J.J. Gittes, which is frustrating and awkward to watch. On second viewing, I took to Nicholson's performance more, he's serviceable with a few moments of finesse. When Nicholson is put in "hammy" scenes, I feel like it's only Jack Nicholson that appears most times. Maybe that's why his work in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is the best work of his career. He gets to play the eccentric character that he is in real life. Faye Dunaway emerges as the heroine grounded in mystery. Her character has layers that Dunaway is allowed to slowly peal off, each layer making sense from what we know about the layer prior. Chinatown is essentially a neo-film noir of its time, and Dunaway fits the bill of a noir heroine to a tee. Set in the 1930s, Chiantown features some wonderful costumes, sets, and cinematography that add to that era and the noir-feeling of the picture. The film score helps the picture set its wonderful tone, also. Roman Polanski is the man I have any kind of a beef with when it comes to Chinatown. Polanski excels at creating the rush for viewers in the second half of the film, but Chinatown's blinding flaw is that the first hour, Polanski lets the picture flat-line. The information we're given in the first hour makes sense at the end of the movie, we need to see these crucial scenes, but Polanski doesn't help make these overreaching plot arc scenes lively enough to keep me interested. The first hour succeeds on all levels, with the huge exception of the lackadaisical directing. The second half, Polanski shifts the film into drive, stomps on the gas petal and makes amends for the first hour's glacial pacing. Finally, what makes Chinatown "Chinatown".....the marvelous screenplay. Robert Towney penned the screenplay, which revived the noir-genre in the 1970s. Not only that, but Towney scribed a manicured script that had thick character development and a serpentine plot that keeps unfolding in your mind even after the movie has concluded. People probably confuse themselves searching for the allegory to bigger things in Chinatown's script, however, literary devices aren't why Chinatown is a step above most screenplays ever written. It's brilliant in the communication to the audience, keeping the audience under water in the mysteries (we're introduced to one big mystery to learn about multiple others in solving the one at hand) of Chinatown and the multiples secrets the characters conceal about their past. Chinatown opens its film in a odd fashion and goes against the formula of film noir anatomy with its first twenty minutes. It's very carefully plotted and tricky to comprehend at first. But then a mystery unfolds that's one of the most satisfying and involved conclusions to a mystery story. Filled to the brim with fine performances and wonderful decor, if you're willing to be patient and relinquish your full attention to the plot, Chinatown is a movie that resonates and unrolls in your mind. The more I've thought about the intelligence behind the film, the closer Chinatown is to getting a perfect from me. Rating: 9.5/10 Grade: A

    Almost 40 years later this movie has lost none of its power to affect. It uses the trappings of a fedora-sporting detective (Jack Nicholson), on the trail of a mystery he doesn't realize he does not want to unravel, to tell a drama of a family destroyed by horrific deeds and secrets. The story remains timeless, ultimately, due to its illumination of the best and worst within us - and that enormous valley where most of us, like detective Jake Gittes, fall - somewhere in between. I won't give away any story, but to give you some idea how powerful this is, I was never able to enjoy John Huston acting in a movie ever again because of his portrayal here (Noah Cross). The revelatory scene between Gittes and Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) retains its power to shock and disturb. What makes this so potent, really, is the screenplay by Robert Towne. It's powerful in ways many movies never reach; and maybe no one writes more realistic dialogue than Towne. The unsavory parts of the story are redeemed by the positive we get from Evelyn Mulwray, and her determination to carry on. Although the story doesn't end with her walking away victorious, her perseverance is really the heart of this tale. 20 years earlier this story could never have been told in a Hollywood movie; the excellence of this one movie - "Chinatown" - makes that entire fight to loosen censorship worthwhile.

    What I love about movies that come from the New Hollywood genres is their quality of elegance that make these pictures into something special that cannot be captured ever again. Whether it is the clean look in the visuals or its technique of not going with all the bare details in story or its characters. That certain mystique is especially captured so beautifully in 'Chinatown.' It's a story that pulls you into a big mystery, but ultimately it feels like the town is full of mysteries. One thing I have to say I love is the effectiveness of the title, in that after watching the movie it finally takes on the true colors of what the movie is about and really gives meaning to what is disturbing about what I just witnessed on screen. And I'll leave it at that. I could go on about the acting performances that really give strength to the film.

Jake is now hired by Mrs. Mulwray to discover who might have wanted her husband dead, and soon Jake will find himself uncovering an entire web of deceit and corruption that is much bigger than he thinks. This masterful film was nominated for 11 Academy Awards, but only won one (Best Original Screenplay written by Robert Towne) considering it had to compete in 1975 with another perfect film: The Godfather Part II. One of the best things about Chinatown actually is the screenplay. There are so many great dialogues and quotes from this film that are still remembered today almost 40 years later. Chinatown is exactly what a classical film looks like. Polanski created a masterpiece by recreating the classic film noir from the 40's with great art direction, costume designs, and cinematography. The editing and the original score are also done wonderfully, but none of this would be enough if it weren't for the wonderful performances from Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway. Chinatown deserves all the praise it has received over time and it has really turned into a timeless classic and one of the few that continues to astonish modern audiences. The twists and surprises in Chinatown continue to work today.

    What a fantastic crime thriller from Roman Polanski. Chinatown is superbly acted, very stylish and contains a mysterious story that will keep you enthralled until the end. There are several shocking and disturbing moments, which were delivered quite effectively throughout the film. The score is done pretty well and helps propelling the intensity in a lot of scenes. I was constantly entertained and intrigued by Jack Nicholson's character as he's a sarcastic, witty and persistent detective. Faye Dunaway and John Huston are other highlights and delivered excellent performances as well. I was really moved by its haunting ending and shocked by the main twist presented earlier in the film. Chinatown is certainly one of the best American noirs ever made and I highly recommend it.

    The Los Angeles District Attorney tells cops in Chinatown to do "as little as possible." When detective Jake Gittes was on that beat, the DA used to tell him "you may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't." There isn't much doubt about what happened to Jake in Chinatown back then. Trying to prevent it from happening, he explains, had only assured that it would. It would have been better to have done nothing at all. He gives that advice to at least one prospective patron of his private eye business when she comes to him with a concern about her cheating husband. "Go home and forget everything," he says, and for once this sarcastic, confident, inquisitive detective seems sincere and tired and sad. This line of work is how he makes his living, but he isn't out to see anyone get hurt. He takes the case, of course, and follows it where it leads, which is to a place where he can do nothing to prevent those who know too little from doing too much. Maybe he should have just gone home and forgotten everything, but then we wouldn't have Robert Towne's deft, classic screenplay.

    As I wrote the title to this post, the year "1974" flashed before my eyes in terms of my opinion of the highly respected film Chinatown. I've now seen this film twice, the first time I "convinced" myself it to love it no matter what I actually thought of it, knowing how highly regarded screenplay is in the movie industry. Honestly, I felt the film's pacing was a dud and Nicholson didn't work as the leading character. The screenplay was fine, but I felt like I was going to drown in my own saliva from falling asleep in this boring movie. I rewatched the film knowing where the story is going and having a firm grip on the plot and came out drinking the Chinatown cool-aid. My most substantial complaints of my first viewing of Chinatown, pacing aside, was the disappointment I felt in Jack Nicholson's performance. I before thought he was playing himself as a detective. Jack Nicholson the Detective, not J.J. Gittes, which is frustrating and awkward to watch. On second viewing, I took to Nicholson's performance more, he's serviceable with a few moments of finesse. When Nicholson is put in "hammy" scenes, I feel like it's only Jack Nicholson that appears most times. Maybe that's why his work in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is the best work of his career. He gets to play the eccentric character that he is in real life. Faye Dunaway emerges as the heroine grounded in mystery. Her character has layers that Dunaway is allowed to slowly peal off, each layer making sense from what we know about the layer prior. Chinatown is essentially a neo-film noir of its time, and Dunaway fits the bill of a noir heroine to a tee. Set in the 1930s, Chiantown features some wonderful costumes, sets, and cinematography that add to that era and the noir-feeling of the picture. The film score helps the picture set its wonderful tone, also. Roman Polanski is the man I have any kind of a beef with when it comes to Chinatown. Polanski excels at creating the rush for viewers in the second half of the film, but Chinatown's blinding flaw is that the first hour, Polanski lets the picture flat-line. The information we're given in the first hour makes sense at the end of the movie, we need to see these crucial scenes, but Polanski doesn't help make these overreaching plot arc scenes lively enough to keep me interested. The first hour succeeds on all levels, with the huge exception of the lackadaisical directing. The second half, Polanski shifts the film into drive, stomps on the gas petal and makes amends for the first hour's glacial pacing. Finally, what makes Chinatown "Chinatown".....the marvelous screenplay. Robert Towney penned the screenplay, which revived the noir-genre in the 1970s. Not only that, but Towney scribed a manicured script that had thick character development and a serpentine plot that keeps unfolding in your mind even after the movie has concluded. People probably confuse themselves searching for the allegory to bigger things in Chinatown's script, however, literary devices aren't why Chinatown is a step above most screenplays ever written. It's brilliant in the communication to the audience, keeping the audience under water in the mysteries (we're introduced to one big mystery to learn about multiple others in solving the one at hand) of Chinatown and the multiples secrets the characters conceal about their past. Chinatown opens its film in a odd fashion and goes against the formula of film noir anatomy with its first twenty minutes. It's very carefully plotted and tricky to comprehend at first. But then a mystery unfolds that's one of the most satisfying and involved conclusions to a mystery story. Filled to the brim with fine performances and wonderful decor, if you're willing to be patient and relinquish your full attention to the plot, Chinatown is a movie that resonates and unrolls in your mind. The more I've thought about the intelligence behind the film, the closer Chinatown is to getting a perfect from me. Rating: 9.5/10 Grade: A

    Almost 40 years later this movie has lost none of its power to affect. It uses the trappings of a fedora-sporting detective (Jack Nicholson), on the trail of a mystery he doesn't realize he does not want to unravel, to tell a drama of a family destroyed by horrific deeds and secrets. The story remains timeless, ultimately, due to its illumination of the best and worst within us - and that enormous valley where most of us, like detective Jake Gittes, fall - somewhere in between. I won't give away any story, but to give you some idea how powerful this is, I was never able to enjoy John Huston acting in a movie ever again because of his portrayal here (Noah Cross). The revelatory scene between Gittes and Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) retains its power to shock and disturb. What makes this so potent, really, is the screenplay by Robert Towne. It's powerful in ways many movies never reach; and maybe no one writes more realistic dialogue than Towne. The unsavory parts of the story are redeemed by the positive we get from Evelyn Mulwray, and her determination to carry on. Although the story doesn't end with her walking away victorious, her perseverance is really the heart of this tale. 20 years earlier this story could never have been told in a Hollywood movie; the excellence of this one movie - "Chinatown" - makes that entire fight to loosen censorship worthwhile.

    What I love about movies that come from the New Hollywood genres is their quality of elegance that make these pictures into something special that cannot be captured ever again. Whether it is the clean look in the visuals or its technique of not going with all the bare details in story or its characters. That certain mystique is especially captured so beautifully in 'Chinatown.' It's a story that pulls you into a big mystery, but ultimately it feels like the town is full of mysteries. One thing I have to say I love is the effectiveness of the title, in that after watching the movie it finally takes on the true colors of what the movie is about and really gives meaning to what is disturbing about what I just witnessed on screen. And I'll leave it at that. I could go on about the acting performances that really give strength to the film. All I could say is that the collaborative effort of the creation of the story, its characters and its atmosphere all culminate in creating a movie that is truly dark and brooding. It's basically a movie that will stick with you. This is probably a horrible review, but I guess I just want to let anyone know who might read this that this is a classic.

    getting ready to watch this movie, I was excited to see how this could go about. I wasn't sure if I'd like the film too much or maybe not at all. I was completely awed. The movie is the extreme mystery. The fact that it ends up as a twist is very powerful. The beautiful scenery of the water was a great way to get a better understanding of Los Angeles. I have seen movies like this, but then again I haven't. So was this a reference movie? It could possibly be one, I am sure. Needless to say, the camera work and the shots of the film were great. I loved the whole storyline of the film. It kept me entertained and kept me wondering where something was gong to pop up and when something else out of the ordinary would pop up.

    After masterpieces like "Knife in the water", "Repulsion" and "Rosemary's Baby". Roman Polanski (one of the best directors who ever lived, and lives), proved to be a competent director and screenwriter in various genres, decided to make a tribute to the genre that he grew up watching, "Noir", in the best way possible. Doing in my opinion his ultimate masterpiece! "Chinatown" tells the story of J.J. "Jake" Gittes (Jack Nicholson), a private detective in L.A., specialized in cases of marriage. One day, he is hired by Evelyn Mulwray, who suspect's of her husband Hollis Mulwray (Darrell Zwerling), the builder of the water supply system of the city, thinking that he is having an affair. Jake then does what he does best with his assistants and follows and takes photos of Hollis with his young lover, inadvertently causing a huge scandal in the press. Later after a job well done, Jake gets into his office the real Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) putting a process in Jake accusing him of fraud. Jake knowing that he was set-up, he begins to investigate who was the fake Mrs. Mulwray, and trying to get in touch with Hollis Mulwray, because he believe that who cheated him wanted to hurt Mr. Mulwray. Only when Jake tries to contact Mulwray, he is found dead in a channeling of the water system of the city. Now Jake asks the help of the real Mrs. Mulwray to help him in his investigation of those responsible for the death of the poor man, but this will take him into a web of lies and corruption, keeping horrible secrets of the city. Polanski from the beginning wanted to do a tribute to the films noir of the '40s and '50s, and he did it "perfectly". First unite the types of cases and scandals of a usual noir film: policy; familial cases; xenophobia and racism; corruption; and of course murder. Mixing humor, and also dark and thrilling moments to the history. Thanks to a superb direction of Polanski, and also the strongest point of the film (and surprisingly the only Oscar that the film received), the script. The script by Robert Towne, who was initially written by Polanski, is superb in every possible detail. Very well written from start to finish, giving the film a wonderful narrative that flows perfectly without ever getting boring and also, thanks to the influence of Polanski, is full of humor. But it also never ceases to be serious and dark when needs to be, giving superb dialogs to the film, adding a lot to the history. Not only long conversations about the case, but also on the definition of what is justice, spread all over the film. Jake before he was a private detective, he was a police officer in Chinatown, and saw many terrible things. And he says in a moment in the film that justice doesn't exist, only we can make-it. Not only the script and direction that construct the film excellently, but also the magnificent actors. Jack Nicholson at the beginning of his career is definitely superb, from start to finish with his huge smile and his angry face, opening a huge future in front of him; Faye Dunaway simply wonderful, she is the mixture of all the heroines of a Noir film, and mature fragile; even Polanski with a small and dark appearance. Polanski, at its best, making an incredible tribute to the Noir genre (perhaps the best Noir movie ever made) with a superb script, beautiful direction, excellent performances, a story that leaves you intrigued and drag you to the end with laughs and chills, and after the end even tears. 10/10

    The movie is by far one of the best, or may be the best mystery thriller I've enjoyed watching. It has a decent run time of 130 minutes. It possesses one of the most dreadful and baffled story lines. The concept of a detective chasing down a murderer is unvaried, yet this one seems a lot superior to the others. Being many characters involved, it becomes very challenging for the audience to predict the culprit. However, the climax throws me for a loop. The cast was extra-ordinary. The script of the movie was written by the writer, Robert Towne keeping Jack Nicholson in his mind. And, the legend didn't let us down, gave such a splendid and natural performance which won him an Oscar nomination for the best actor in a leading role. The female lead Faye Dunaway did an exceptional job, she was spot on with her expressions and her casualness. John Huston as Noah Cross and Perry Lopez as Escobar too were appreciable. The director, Roman Polanksi who also played a minor supporting role in the movie, deserves to be eulogized. The movie has been drawn out in such a way, which guarantees utmost satisfaction to the viewers. The background score by Jerry Goldsmith too had no problem whatsoever. The movie is highly recommended to the viewers who find solace in watching the movies relevant to the genres of mystery, thriller and crime.

    Bolstered by strong performances from its leading cast, brilliant script by Robert Towne and taut direction by Roman Polanski, Chinatown is one of the best offerings of the mystery genre. Jack Nicholson stars as private detective, J J Gittes and gives a really composed performance and is literally present in every single scene in this film. Faye Dunaway as Evelyn Mulwray puts up another strong performance to go neck to neck with Nicholson's work. But the real star of this film is its script & direction as Polanski's steady work behind the camera & Towne's sturdy script are works of pure craftsmanship and carries no complains. An engaging drama promising a lot of surprises & uncertainty throughout its runtime which finally ends with a soul-shattering climaxÂ… that's Chinatown for you.

    "You may think you know what you're dealing with, but, believe me, you don't." Sometimes things are bigger than ourselves, and despite how much we think we can change the world eventually we are brought down to our reality: we are much smaller than we think we are and there is little we can do against the big corporate giants. That is the main theme that director, Roman Polanski, is trying to explore here in this criminal film noir thriller starring Jack Nicholson as a wise and overly confident private detective who is about to learn that despite how much he wants to teach the bad guys a lesson perhaps things are a little out of his league. That is why the film is titled Chinatown, because it represents a time in Jake's (Nicholson's character) life where he wasn't able to make a difference in the police force and became cynical towards the world. "Forget it, Jake, it's Chinatown" is what they told him, and that is why he decided to retire and become a private investigator working on his own. He doesn't want to forget it, he wants to catch the bad guys and balance things out. He doesn't want these rich executives to continue thinking they can get away with anything. That is exactly why he decides to investigate things on his own and begins to enter dangerous territory where not everyone is who they say they are. He slowly begins to uncover one lie after another, and that is what makes Chinatown such an entertaining and masterful thriller. We are part of the investigation and begin discovering things at the same time Jake does. We are as confident as he is that he is going to uncover everything. This is Jack Nicholson's movie from the opening scene and he delivers one of his best performances to date. Faye Dunaway is also interesting in her femme fatale role; we are never sure if we can trust her or not. Polanski has delivered a perfect homage to the 40's film noir thrillers. Chinatown will remain as one of the best classical films of all time. This is my favorite Polanski film, perfect in every way. Jake Gittes seems to be doing well as a private detective in Los Angeles, since he specializes in infidelities and there are many in the city. His latest assignment is to follow Evelyn Mulwray's (Diane Ladd) husband who happens to be the builder of the city's water supply system. His name is Hollis (Darrell Zwerling) and he is fascinated with everything that has to do with water, but Evelyn is convinced he is having an affair. Jake accepts the job and begins following Hollis, and surely enough he photographs him with a younger woman causing a scandal in the city. Jake believes his job is done, until a Mrs. Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) comes thundering into his office claiming that she had never hired him to follow her husband. Apparently the first woman claiming to be Mrs. Mulwray was only an impersonator and now Jake has a law suit in his hands. Surprisingly Mrs. Mulwray drops the law suit a few days later, and her husband is found dead after an apparent suicide. Jake is now hired by Mrs. Mulwray to discover who might have wanted her husband dead, and soon Jake will find himself uncovering an entire web of deceit and corruption that is much bigger than he thinks. This masterful film was nominated for 11 Academy Awards, but only won one (Best Original Screenplay written by Robert Towne) considering it had to compete in 1975 with another perfect film: The Godfather Part II. One of the best things about Chinatown actually is the screenplay. There are so many great dialogues and quotes from this film that are still remembered today almost 40 years later.

    getting ready to watch this movie, I was excited to see how this could go about. I wasn't sure if I'd like the film too much or maybe not at all. I was completely awed. The movie is the extreme mystery. The fact that it ends up as a twist is very powerful. The beautiful scenery of the water was a great way to get a better understanding of Los Angeles. I have seen movies like this, but then again I haven't. So was this a reference movie? It could possibly be one, I am sure. Needless to say, the camera work and the shots of the film were great. I loved the whole storyline of the film. It kept me entertained and kept me wondering where something was gong to pop up and when something else out of the ordinary would pop up.

    After masterpieces like "Knife in the water", "Repulsion" and "Rosemary's Baby". Roman Polanski (one of the best directors who ever lived, and lives), proved to be a competent director and screenwriter in various genres, decided to make a tribute to the genre that he grew up watching, "Noir", in the best way possible. Doing in my opinion his ultimate masterpiece! "Chinatown" tells the story of J.J. "Jake" Gittes (Jack Nicholson), a private detective in L.A., specialized in cases of marriage. One day, he is hired by Evelyn Mulwray, who suspect's of her husband Hollis Mulwray (Darrell Zwerling), the builder of the water supply system of the city, thinking that he is having an affair. Jake then does what he does best with his assistants and follows and takes photos of Hollis with his young lover, inadvertently causing a huge scandal in the press. Later after a job well done, Jake gets into his office the real Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) putting a process in Jake accusing him of fraud. Jake knowing that he was set-up, he begins to investigate who was the fake Mrs. Mulwray, and trying to get in touch with Hollis Mulwray, because he believe that who cheated him wanted to hurt Mr. Mulwray. Only when Jake tries to contact Mulwray, he is found dead in a channeling of the water system of the city. Now Jake asks the help of the real Mrs. Mulwray to help him in his investigation of those responsible for the death of the poor man, but this will take him into a web of lies and corruption, keeping horrible secrets of the city. Polanski from the beginning wanted to do a tribute to the films noir of the '40s and '50s, and he did it "perfectly". First unite the types of cases and scandals of a usual noir film: policy; familial cases; xenophobia and racism; corruption; and of course murder. Mixing humor, and also dark and thrilling moments to the history. Thanks to a superb direction of Polanski, and also the strongest point of the film (and surprisingly the only Oscar that the film received), the script. The script by Robert Towne, who was initially written by Polanski, is superb in every possible detail. Very well written from start to finish, giving the film a wonderful narrative that flows perfectly without ever getting boring and also, thanks to the influence of Polanski, is full of humor. But it also never ceases to be serious and dark when needs to be, giving superb dialogs to the film, adding a lot to the history. Not only long conversations about the case, but also on the definition of what is justice, spread all over the film. Jake before he was a private detective, he was a police officer in Chinatown, and saw many terrible things. And he says in a moment in the film that justice doesn't exist, only we can make-it. Not only the script and direction that construct the film excellently, but also the magnificent actors. Jack Nicholson at the beginning of his career is definitely superb, from start to finish with his huge smile and his angry face, opening a huge future in front of him; Faye Dunaway simply wonderful, she is the mixture of all the heroines of a Noir film, and mature fragile; even Polanski with a small and dark appearance. Polanski, at its best, making an incredible tribute to the Noir genre (perhaps the best Noir movie ever made) with a superb script, beautiful direction, excellent performances, a story that leaves you intrigued and drag you to the end with laughs and chills, and after the end even tears. 10/10

    The movie is by far one of the best, or may be the best mystery thriller I've enjoyed watching. It has a decent run time of 130 minutes. It possesses one of the most dreadful and baffled story lines. The concept of a detective chasing down a murderer is unvaried, yet this one seems a lot superior to the others. Being many characters involved, it becomes very challenging for the audience to predict the culprit. However, the climax throws me for a loop. The cast was extra-ordinary. The script of the movie was written by the writer, Robert Towne keeping Jack Nicholson in his mind. And, the legend didn't let us down, gave such a splendid and natural performance which won him an Oscar nomination for the best actor in a leading role. The female lead Faye Dunaway did an exceptional job, she was spot on with her expressions and her casualness. John Huston as Noah Cross and Perry Lopez as Escobar too were appreciable. The director, Roman Polanksi who also played a minor supporting role in the movie, deserves to be eulogized. The movie has been drawn out in such a way, which guarantees utmost satisfaction to the viewers. The background score by Jerry Goldsmith too had no problem whatsoever. The movie is highly recommended to the viewers who find solace in watching the movies relevant to the genres of mystery, thriller and crime.

    Bolstered by strong performances from its leading cast, brilliant script by Robert Towne and taut direction by Roman Polanski, Chinatown is one of the best offerings of the mystery genre. Jack Nicholson stars as private detective, J J Gittes and gives a really composed performance and is literally present in every single scene in this film. Faye Dunaway as Evelyn Mulwray puts up another strong performance to go neck to neck with Nicholson's work. But the real star of this film is its script & direction as Polanski's steady work behind the camera & Towne's sturdy script are works of pure craftsmanship and carries no complains. An engaging drama promising a lot of surprises & uncertainty throughout its runtime which finally ends with a soul-shattering climaxÂ… that's Chinatown for you.

    "You may think you know what you're dealing with, but, believe me, you don't." Sometimes things are bigger than ourselves, and despite how much we think we can change the world eventually we are brought down to our reality: we are much smaller than we think we are and there is little we can do against the big corporate giants. That is the main theme that director, Roman Polanski, is trying to explore here in this criminal film noir thriller starring Jack Nicholson as a wise and overly confident private detective who is about to learn that despite how much he wants to teach the bad guys a lesson perhaps things are a little out of his league. That is why the film is titled Chinatown, because it represents a time in Jake's (Nicholson's character) life where he wasn't able to make a difference in the police force and became cynical towards the world. "Forget it, Jake, it's Chinatown" is what they told him, and that is why he decided to retire and become a private investigator working on his own. He doesn't want to forget it, he wants to catch the bad guys and balance things out. He doesn't want these rich executives to continue thinking they can get away with anything. That is exactly why he decides to investigate things on his own and begins to enter dangerous territory where not everyone is who they say they are. He slowly begins to uncover one lie after another, and that is what makes Chinatown such an entertaining and masterful thriller. We are part of the investigation and begin discovering things at the same time Jake does. We are as confident as he is that he is going to uncover everything. This is Jack Nicholson's movie from the opening scene and he delivers one of his best performances to date. Faye Dunaway is also interesting in her femme fatale role; we are never sure if we can trust her or not. Polanski has delivered a perfect homage to the 40's film noir thrillers. Chinatown will remain as one of the best classical films of all time. This is my favorite Polanski film, perfect in every way. Jake Gittes seems to be doing well as a private detective in Los Angeles, since he specializes in infidelities and there are many in the city. His latest assignment is to follow Evelyn Mulwray's (Diane Ladd) husband who happens to be the builder of the city's water supply system. His name is Hollis (Darrell Zwerling) and he is fascinated with everything that has to do with water, but Evelyn is convinced he is having an affair. Jake accepts the job and begins following Hollis, and surely enough he photographs him with a younger woman causing a scandal in the city. Jake believes his job is done, until a Mrs. Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) comes thundering into his office claiming that she had never hired him to follow her husband. Apparently the first woman claiming to be Mrs. Mulwray was only an impersonator and now Jake has a law suit in his hands. Surprisingly Mrs. Mulwray drops the law suit a few days later, and her husband is found dead after an apparent suicide. Jake is now hired by Mrs. Mulwray to discover who might have wanted her husband dead, and soon Jake will find himself uncovering an entire web of deceit and corruption that is much bigger than he thinks. This masterful film was nominated for 11 Academy Awards, but only won one (Best Original Screenplay written by Robert Towne) considering it had to compete in 1975 with another perfect film: The Godfather Part II. One of the best things about Chinatown actually is the screenplay. There are so many great dialogues and quotes from this film that are still remembered today almost 40 years later. Chinatown is exactly what a classical film looks like. Polanski created a masterpiece by recreating the classic film noir from the 40's with great art direction, costume designs, and cinematography. The editing and the original score are also done wonderfully, but none of this would be enough if it weren't for the wonderful performances from Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway. Chinatown deserves all the praise it has received over time and it has really turned into a timeless classic and one of the few that continues to astonish modern audiences. The twists and surprises in Chinatown continue to work today.

    What a fantastic crime thriller from Roman Polanski. Chinatown is superbly acted, very stylish and contains a mysterious story that will keep you enthralled until the end. There are several shocking and disturbing moments, which were delivered quite effectively throughout the film. The score is done pretty well and helps propelling the intensity in a lot of scenes. I was constantly entertained and intrigued by Jack Nicholson's character as he's a sarcastic, witty and persistent detective. Faye Dunaway and John Huston are other highlights and delivered excellent performances as well. I was really moved by its haunting ending and shocked by the main twist presented earlier in the film. Chinatown is certainly one of the best American noirs ever made and I highly recommend it.

    The Los Angeles District Attorney tells cops in Chinatown to do "as little as possible." When detective Jake Gittes was on that beat, the DA used to tell him "you may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't." There isn't much doubt about what happened to Jake in Chinatown back then. Trying to prevent it from happening, he explains, had only assured that it would. It would have been better to have done nothing at all. He gives that advice to at least one prospective patron of his private eye business when she comes to him with a concern about her cheating husband. "Go home and forget everything," he says, and for once this sarcastic, confident, inquisitive detective seems sincere and tired and sad. This line of work is how he makes his living, but he isn't out to see anyone get hurt. He takes the case, of course, and follows it where it leads, which is to a place where he can do nothing to prevent those who know too little from doing too much. Maybe he should have just gone home and forgotten everything, but then we wouldn't have Robert Towne's deft, classic screenplay.

    As I wrote the title to this post, the year "1974" flashed before my eyes in terms of my opinion of the highly respected film Chinatown. I've now seen this film twice, the first time I "convinced" myself it to love it no matter what I actually thought of it, knowing how highly regarded screenplay is in the movie industry. Honestly, I felt the film's pacing was a dud and Nicholson didn't work as the leading character. The screenplay was fine, but I felt like I was going to drown in my own saliva from falling asleep in this boring movie. I rewatched the film knowing where the story is going and having a firm grip on the plot and came out drinking the Chinatown cool-aid. My most substantial complaints of my first viewing of Chinatown, pacing aside, was the disappointment I felt in Jack Nicholson's performance. I before thought he was playing himself as a detective. Jack Nicholson the Detective, not J.J. Gittes, which is frustrating and awkward to watch. On second viewing, I took to Nicholson's performance more, he's serviceable with a few moments of finesse. When Nicholson is put in "hammy" scenes, I feel like it's only Jack Nicholson that appears most times. Maybe that's why his work in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is the best work of his career. He gets to play the eccentric character that he is in real life. Faye Dunaway emerges as the heroine grounded in mystery. Her character has layers that Dunaway is allowed to slowly peal off, each layer making sense from what we know about the layer prior. Chinatown is essentially a neo-film noir of its time, and Dunaway fits the bill of a noir heroine to a tee. Set in the 1930s, Chiantown features some wonderful costumes, sets, and cinematography that add to that era and the noir-feeling of the picture. The film score helps the picture set its wonderful tone, also. Roman Polanski is the man I have any kind of a beef with when it comes to Chinatown. Polanski excels at creating the rush for viewers in the second half of the film, but Chinatown's blinding flaw is that the first hour, Polanski lets the picture flat-line. The information we're given in the first hour makes sense at the end of the movie, we need to see these crucial scenes, but Polanski doesn't help make these overreaching plot arc scenes lively enough to keep me interested. The first hour succeeds on all levels, with the huge exception of the lackadaisical directing. The second half, Polanski shifts the film into drive, stomps on the gas petal and makes amends for the first hour's glacial pacing. Finally, what makes Chinatown "Chinatown".....the marvelous screenplay. Robert Towney penned the screenplay, which revived the noir-genre in the 1970s. Not only that, but Towney scribed a manicured script that had thick character development and a serpentine plot that keeps unfolding in your mind even after the movie has concluded. People probably confuse themselves searching for the allegory to bigger things in Chinatown's script, however, literary devices aren't why Chinatown is a step above most screenplays ever written. It's brilliant in the communication to the audience, keeping the audience under water in the mysteries (we're introduced to one big mystery to learn about multiple others in solving the one at hand) of Chinatown and the multiples secrets the characters conceal about their past. Chinatown opens its film in a odd fashion and goes against the formula of film noir anatomy with its first twenty minutes. It's very carefully plotted and tricky to comprehend at first. But then a mystery unfolds that's one of the most satisfying and involved conclusions to a mystery story. Filled to the brim with fine performances and wonderful decor, if you're willing to be patient and relinquish your full attention to the plot, Chinatown is a movie that resonates and unrolls in your mind. The more I've thought about the intelligence behind the film, the closer Chinatown is to getting a perfect from me. Rating: 9.5/10 Grade: A

    Almost 40 years later this movie has lost none of its power to affect. It uses the trappings of a fedora-sporting detective (Jack Nicholson), on the trail of a mystery he doesn't realize he does not want to unravel, to tell a drama of a family destroyed by horrific deeds and secrets. The story remains timeless, ultimately, due to its illumination of the best and worst within us - and that enormous valley where most of us, like detective Jake Gittes, fall - somewhere in between. I won't give away any story, but to give you some idea how powerful this is, I was never able to enjoy John Huston acting in a movie ever again because of his portrayal here (Noah Cross). The revelatory scene between Gittes and Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) retains its power to shock and disturb. What makes this so potent, really, is the screenplay by Robert Towne. It's powerful in ways many movies never reach; and maybe no one writes more realistic dialogue than Towne. The unsavory parts of the story are redeemed by the positive we get from Evelyn Mulwray, and her determination to carry on. Although the story doesn't end with her walking away victorious, her perseverance is really the heart of this tale. 20 years earlier this story could never have been told in a Hollywood movie; the excellence of this one movie - "Chinatown" - makes that entire fight to loosen censorship worthwhile.

    What I love about movies that come from the New Hollywood genres is their quality of elegance that make these pictures into something special that cannot be captured ever again. Whether it is the clean look in the visuals or its technique of not going with all the bare details in story or its characters. That certain mystique is especially captured so beautifully in 'Chinatown.' It's a story that pulls you into a big mystery, but ultimately it feels like the town is full of mysteries. One thing I have to say I love is the effectiveness of the title, in that after watching the movie it finally takes on the true colors of what the movie is about and really gives meaning to what is disturbing about what I just witnessed on screen. And I'll leave it at that. I could go on about the acting performances that really give strength to the film. All I could say is that the collaborative effort of the creation of the story, its characters and its atmosphere all culminate in creating a movie that is truly dark and brooding. It's basically a movie that will stick with you. This is probably a horrible review, but I guess I just want to let anyone know who might read this that this is a classic.

Chinatown deserves all the praise it has received over time and it has really turned into a timeless classic and one of the few that continues to astonish modern audiences. The twists and surprises in Chinatown continue to work today.

    What a fantastic crime thriller from Roman Polanski. Chinatown is superbly acted, very stylish and contains a mysterious story that will keep you enthralled until the end. There are several shocking and disturbing moments, which were delivered quite effectively throughout the film. The score is done pretty well and helps propelling the intensity in a lot of scenes. I was constantly entertained and intrigued by Jack Nicholson's character as he's a sarcastic, witty and persistent detective. Faye Dunaway and John Huston are other highlights and delivered excellent performances as well. I was really moved by its haunting ending and shocked by the main twist presented earlier in the film. Chinatown is certainly one of the best American noirs ever made and I highly recommend it.

    The Los Angeles District Attorney tells cops in Chinatown to do "as little as possible." When detective Jake Gittes was on that beat, the DA used to tell him "you may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't." There isn't much doubt about what happened to Jake in Chinatown back then. Trying to prevent it from happening, he explains, had only assured that it would. It would have been better to have done nothing at all. He gives that advice to at least one prospective patron of his private eye business when she comes to him with a concern about her cheating husband. "Go home and forget everything," he says, and for once this sarcastic, confident, inquisitive detective seems sincere and tired and sad. This line of work is how he makes his living, but he isn't out to see anyone get hurt. He takes the case, of course, and follows it where it leads, which is to a place where he can do nothing to prevent those who know too little from doing too much. Maybe he should have just gone home and forgotten everything, but then we wouldn't have Robert Towne's deft, classic screenplay.

    As I wrote the title to this post, the year "1974" flashed before my eyes in terms of my opinion of the highly respected film Chinatown. I've now seen this film twice, the first time I "convinced" myself it to love it no matter what I actually thought of it, knowing how highly regarded screenplay is in the movie industry. Honestly, I felt the film's pacing was a dud and Nicholson didn't work as the leading character. The screenplay was fine, but I felt like I was going to drown in my own saliva from falling asleep in this boring movie. I rewatched the film knowing where the story is going and having a firm grip on the plot and came out drinking the Chinatown cool-aid. My most substantial complaints of my first viewing of Chinatown, pacing aside, was the disappointment I felt in Jack Nicholson's performance. I before thought he was playing himself as a detective. Jack Nicholson the Detective, not J.J. Gittes, which is frustrating and awkward to watch. On second viewing, I took to Nicholson's performance more, he's serviceable with a few moments of finesse. When Nicholson is put in "hammy" scenes, I feel like it's only Jack Nicholson that appears most times. Maybe that's why his work in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is the best work of his career. He gets to play the eccentric character that he is in real life. Faye Dunaway emerges as the heroine grounded in mystery. Her character has layers that Dunaway is allowed to slowly peal off, each layer making sense from what we know about the layer prior. Chinatown is essentially a neo-film noir of its time, and Dunaway fits the bill of a noir heroine to a tee. Set in the 1930s, Chiantown features some wonderful costumes, sets, and cinematography that add to that era and the noir-feeling of the picture. The film score helps the picture set its wonderful tone, also. Roman Polanski is the man I have any kind of a beef with when it comes to Chinatown. Polanski excels at creating the rush for viewers in the second half of the film, but Chinatown's blinding flaw is that the first hour, Polanski lets the picture flat-line. The information we're given in the first hour makes sense at the end of the movie, we need to see these crucial scenes, but Polanski doesn't help make these overreaching plot arc scenes lively enough to keep me interested. The first hour succeeds on all levels, with the huge exception of the lackadaisical directing. The second half, Polanski shifts the film into drive, stomps on the gas petal and makes amends for the first hour's glacial pacing. Finally, what makes Chinatown "Chinatown".....the marvelous screenplay. Robert Towney penned the screenplay, which revived the noir-genre in the 1970s. Not only that, but Towney scribed a manicured script that had thick character development and a serpentine plot that keeps unfolding in your mind even after the movie has concluded. People probably confuse themselves searching for the allegory to bigger things in Chinatown's script, however, literary devices aren't why Chinatown is a step above most screenplays ever written. It's brilliant in the communication to the audience, keeping the audience under water in the mysteries (we're introduced to one big mystery to learn about multiple others in solving the one at hand) of Chinatown and the multiples secrets the characters conceal about their past. Chinatown opens its film in a odd fashion and goes against the formula of film noir anatomy with its first twenty minutes. It's very carefully plotted and tricky to comprehend at first. But then a mystery unfolds that's one of the most satisfying and involved conclusions to a mystery story. Filled to the brim with fine performances and wonderful decor, if you're willing to be patient and relinquish your full attention to the plot, Chinatown is a movie that resonates and unrolls in your mind. The more I've thought about the intelligence behind the film, the closer Chinatown is to getting a perfect from me. Rating: 9.5/10 Grade: A

    Almost 40 years later this movie has lost none of its power to affect. It uses the trappings of a fedora-sporting detective (Jack Nicholson), on the trail of a mystery he doesn't realize he does not want to unravel, to tell a drama of a family destroyed by horrific deeds and secrets. The story remains timeless, ultimately, due to its illumination of the best and worst within us - and that enormous valley where most of us, like detective Jake Gittes, fall - somewhere in between. I won't give away any story, but to give you some idea how powerful this is, I was never able to enjoy John Huston acting in a movie ever again because of his portrayal here (Noah Cross). The revelatory scene between Gittes and Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) retains its power to shock and disturb. What makes this so potent, really, is the screenplay by Robert Towne. It's powerful in ways many movies never reach; and maybe no one writes more realistic dialogue than Towne. The unsavory parts of the story are redeemed by the positive we get from Evelyn Mulwray, and her determination to carry on. Although the story doesn't end with her walking away victorious, her perseverance is really the heart of this tale. 20 years earlier this story could never have been told in a Hollywood movie; the excellence of this one movie - "Chinatown" - makes that entire fight to loosen censorship worthwhile.

    What I love about movies that come from the New Hollywood genres is their quality of elegance that make these pictures into something special that cannot be captured ever again. Whether it is the clean look in the visuals or its technique of not going with all the bare details in story or its characters. That certain mystique is especially captured so beautifully in 'Chinatown.' It's a story that pulls you into a big mystery, but ultimately it feels like the town is full of mysteries. One thing I have to say I love is the effectiveness of the title, in that after watching the movie it finally takes on the true colors of what the movie is about and really gives meaning to what is disturbing about what I just witnessed on screen. And I'll leave it at that. I could go on about the acting performances that really give strength to the film. All I could say is that the collaborative effort of the creation of the story, its characters and its atmosphere all culminate in creating a movie that is truly dark and brooding. It's basically a movie that will stick with you. This is probably a horrible review, but I guess I just want to let anyone know who might read this that this is a classic.

    getting ready to watch this movie, I was excited to see how this could go about. I wasn't sure if I'd like the film too much or maybe not at all. I was completely awed. The movie is the extreme mystery. The fact that it ends up as a twist is very powerful. The beautiful scenery of the water was a great way to get a better understanding of Los Angeles. I have seen movies like this, but then again I haven't. So was this a reference movie? It could possibly be one, I am sure. Needless to say, the camera work and the shots of the film were great. I loved the whole storyline of the film. It kept me entertained and kept me wondering where something was gong to pop up and when something else out of the ordinary would pop up.

    After masterpieces like "Knife in the water", "Repulsion" and "Rosemary's Baby". Roman Polanski (one of the best directors who ever lived, and lives), proved to be a competent director and screenwriter in various genres, decided to make a tribute to the genre that he grew up watching, "Noir", in the best way possible. Doing in my opinion his ultimate masterpiece! "Chinatown" tells the story of J.J. "Jake" Gittes (Jack Nicholson), a private detective in L.A., specialized in cases of marriage. One day, he is hired by Evelyn Mulwray, who suspect's of her husband Hollis Mulwray (Darrell Zwerling), the builder of the water supply system of the city, thinking that he is having an affair. Jake then does what he does best with his assistants and follows and takes photos of Hollis with his young lover, inadvertently causing a huge scandal in the press. Later after a job well done, Jake gets into his office the real Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) putting a process in Jake accusing him of fraud. Jake knowing that he was set-up, he begins to investigate who was the fake Mrs. Mulwray, and trying to get in touch with Hollis Mulwray, because he believe that who cheated him wanted to hurt Mr. Mulwray. Only when Jake tries to contact Mulwray, he is found dead in a channeling of the water system of the city. Now Jake asks the help of the real Mrs. Mulwray to help him in his investigation of those responsible for the death of the poor man, but this will take him into a web of lies and corruption, keeping horrible secrets of the city. Polanski from the beginning wanted to do a tribute to the films noir of the '40s and '50s, and he did it "perfectly". First unite the types of cases and scandals of a usual noir film: policy; familial cases; xenophobia and racism; corruption; and of course murder. Mixing humor, and also dark and thrilling moments to the history. Thanks to a superb direction of Polanski, and also the strongest point of the film (and surprisingly the only Oscar that the film received), the script. The script by Robert Towne, who was initially written by Polanski, is superb in every possible detail. Very well written from start to finish, giving the film a wonderful narrative that flows perfectly without ever getting boring and also, thanks to the influence of Polanski, is full of humor. But it also never ceases to be serious and dark when needs to be, giving superb dialogs to the film, adding a lot to the history. Not only long conversations about the case, but also on the definition of what is justice, spread all over the film. Jake before he was a private detective, he was a police officer in Chinatown, and saw many terrible things. And he says in a moment in the film that justice doesn't exist, only we can make-it. Not only the script and direction that construct the film excellently, but also the magnificent actors. Jack Nicholson at the beginning of his career is definitely superb, from start to finish with his huge smile and his angry face, opening a huge future in front of him; Faye Dunaway simply wonderful, she is the mixture of all the heroines of a Noir film, and mature fragile; even Polanski with a small and dark appearance. Polanski, at its best, making an incredible tribute to the Noir genre (perhaps the best Noir movie ever made) with a superb script, beautiful direction, excellent performances, a story that leaves you intrigued and drag you to the end with laughs and chills, and after the end even tears. 10/10

    The movie is by far one of the best, or may be the best mystery thriller I've enjoyed watching. It has a decent run time of 130 minutes. It possesses one of the most dreadful and baffled story lines. The concept of a detective chasing down a murderer is unvaried, yet this one seems a lot superior to the others. Being many characters involved, it becomes very challenging for the audience to predict the culprit. However, the climax throws me for a loop. The cast was extra-ordinary. The script of the movie was written by the writer, Robert Towne keeping Jack Nicholson in his mind. And, the legend didn't let us down, gave such a splendid and natural performance which won him an Oscar nomination for the best actor in a leading role. The female lead Faye Dunaway did an exceptional job, she was spot on with her expressions and her casualness. John Huston as Noah Cross and Perry Lopez as Escobar too were appreciable. The director, Roman Polanksi who also played a minor supporting role in the movie, deserves to be eulogized. The movie has been drawn out in such a way, which guarantees utmost satisfaction to the viewers. The background score by Jerry Goldsmith too had no problem whatsoever. The movie is highly recommended to the viewers who find solace in watching the movies relevant to the genres of mystery, thriller and crime.

    Bolstered by strong performances from its leading cast, brilliant script by Robert Towne and taut direction by Roman Polanski, Chinatown is one of the best offerings of the mystery genre. Jack Nicholson stars as private detective, J J Gittes and gives a really composed performance and is literally present in every single scene in this film. Faye Dunaway as Evelyn Mulwray puts up another strong performance to go neck to neck with Nicholson's work. But the real star of this film is its script & direction as Polanski's steady work behind the camera & Towne's sturdy script are works of pure craftsmanship and carries no complains. An engaging drama promising a lot of surprises & uncertainty throughout its runtime which finally ends with a soul-shattering climaxÂ… that's Chinatown for you.

    "You may think you know what you're dealing with, but, believe me, you don't." Sometimes things are bigger than ourselves, and despite how much we think we can change the world eventually we are brought down to our reality: we are much smaller than we think we are and there is little we can do against the big corporate giants. That is the main theme that director, Roman Polanski, is trying to explore here in this criminal film noir thriller starring Jack Nicholson as a wise and overly confident private detective who is about to learn that despite how much he wants to teach the bad guys a lesson perhaps things are a little out of his league. That is why the film is titled Chinatown, because it represents a time in Jake's (Nicholson's character) life where he wasn't able to make a difference in the police force and became cynical towards the world. "Forget it, Jake, it's Chinatown" is what they told him, and that is why he decided to retire and become a private investigator working on his own. He doesn't want to forget it, he wants to catch the bad guys and balance things out. He doesn't want these rich executives to continue thinking they can get away with anything. That is exactly why he decides to investigate things on his own and begins to enter dangerous territory where not everyone is who they say they are. He slowly begins to uncover one lie after another, and that is what makes Chinatown such an entertaining and masterful thriller. We are part of the investigation and begin discovering things at the same time Jake does. We are as confident as he is that he is going to uncover everything. This is Jack Nicholson's movie from the opening scene and he delivers one of his best performances to date. Faye Dunaway is also interesting in her femme fatale role; we are never sure if we can trust her or not. Polanski has delivered a perfect homage to the 40's film noir thrillers. Chinatown will remain as one of the best classical films of all time. This is my favorite Polanski film, perfect in every way. Jake Gittes seems to be doing well as a private detective in Los Angeles, since he specializes in infidelities and there are many in the city. His latest assignment is to follow Evelyn Mulwray's (Diane Ladd) husband who happens to be the builder of the city's water supply system. His name is Hollis (Darrell Zwerling) and he is fascinated with everything that has to do with water, but Evelyn is convinced he is having an affair. Jake accepts the job and begins following Hollis, and surely enough he photographs him with a younger woman causing a scandal in the city. Jake believes his job is done, until a Mrs. Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) comes thundering into his office claiming that she had never hired him to follow her husband. Apparently the first woman claiming to be Mrs. Mulwray was only an impersonator and now Jake has a law suit in his hands. Surprisingly Mrs. Mulwray drops the law suit a few days later, and her husband is found dead after an apparent suicide. Jake is now hired by Mrs. Mulwray to discover who might have wanted her husband dead, and soon Jake will find himself uncovering an entire web of deceit and corruption that is much bigger than he thinks. This masterful film was nominated for 11 Academy Awards, but only won one (Best Original Screenplay written by Robert Towne) considering it had to compete in 1975 with another perfect film: The Godfather Part II. One of the best things about Chinatown actually is the screenplay. There are so many great dialogues and quotes from this film that are still remembered today almost 40 years later. Chinatown is exactly what a classical film looks like. Polanski created a masterpiece by recreating the classic film noir from the 40's with great art direction, costume designs, and cinematography. The editing and the original score are also done wonderfully, but none of this would be enough if it weren't for the wonderful performances from Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway. Chinatown deserves all the praise it has received over time and it has really turned into a timeless classic and one of the few that continues to astonish modern audiences. The twists and surprises in Chinatown continue to work today.

I loved the whole storyline of the film. It kept me entertained and kept me wondering where something was gong to pop up and when something else out of the ordinary would pop up.

    After masterpieces like "Knife in the water", "Repulsion" and "Rosemary's Baby". Roman Polanski (one of the best directors who ever lived, and lives), proved to be a competent director and screenwriter in various genres, decided to make a tribute to the genre that he grew up watching, "Noir", in the best way possible. Doing in my opinion his ultimate masterpiece! "Chinatown" tells the story of J.J. "Jake" Gittes (Jack Nicholson), a private detective in L.A., specialized in cases of marriage. One day, he is hired by Evelyn Mulwray, who suspect's of her husband Hollis Mulwray (Darrell Zwerling), the builder of the water supply system of the city, thinking that he is having an affair. Jake then does what he does best with his assistants and follows and takes photos of Hollis with his young lover, inadvertently causing a huge scandal in the press. Later after a job well done, Jake gets into his office the real Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) putting a process in Jake accusing him of fraud. Jake knowing that he was set-up, he begins to investigate who was the fake Mrs. Mulwray, and trying to get in touch with Hollis Mulwray, because he believe that who cheated him wanted to hurt Mr. Mulwray. Only when Jake tries to contact Mulwray, he is found dead in a channeling of the water system of the city. Now Jake asks the help of the real Mrs. Mulwray to help him in his investigation of those responsible for the death of the poor man, but this will take him into a web of lies and corruption, keeping horrible secrets of the city. Polanski from the beginning wanted to do a tribute to the films noir of the '40s and '50s, and he did it "perfectly". First unite the types of cases and scandals of a usual noir film: policy; familial cases; xenophobia and racism; corruption; and of course murder. Mixing humor, and also dark and thrilling moments to the history. Thanks to a superb direction of Polanski, and also the strongest point of the film (and surprisingly the only Oscar that the film received), the script. The script by Robert Towne, who was initially written by Polanski, is superb in every possible detail. Very well written from start to finish, giving the film a wonderful narrative that flows perfectly without ever getting boring and also, thanks to the influence of Polanski, is full of humor. But it also never ceases to be serious and dark when needs to be, giving superb dialogs to the film, adding a lot to the history. Not only long conversations about the case, but also on the definition of what is justice, spread all over the film. Jake before he was a private detective, he was a police officer in Chinatown, and saw many terrible things. And he says in a moment in the film that justice doesn't exist, only we can make-it. Not only the script and direction that construct the film excellently, but also the magnificent actors. Jack Nicholson at the beginning of his career is definitely superb, from start to finish with his huge smile and his angry face, opening a huge future in front of him; Faye Dunaway simply wonderful, she is the mixture of all the heroines of a Noir film, and mature fragile; even Polanski with a small and dark appearance. Polanski, at its best, making an incredible tribute to the Noir genre (perhaps the best Noir movie ever made) with a superb script, beautiful direction, excellent performances, a story that leaves you intrigued and drag you to the end with laughs and chills, and after the end even tears. 10/10

    The movie is by far one of the best, or may be the best mystery thriller I've enjoyed watching. It has a decent run time of 130 minutes. It possesses one of the most dreadful and baffled story lines. The concept of a detective chasing down a murderer is unvaried, yet this one seems a lot superior to the others. Being many characters involved, it becomes very challenging for the audience to predict the culprit. However, the climax throws me for a loop. The cast was extra-ordinary. The script of the movie was written by the writer, Robert Towne keeping Jack Nicholson in his mind. And, the legend didn't let us down, gave such a splendid and natural performance which won him an Oscar nomination for the best actor in a leading role. The female lead Faye Dunaway did an exceptional job, she was spot on with her expressions and her casualness. John Huston as Noah Cross and Perry Lopez as Escobar too were appreciable. The director, Roman Polanksi who also played a minor supporting role in the movie, deserves to be eulogized. The movie has been drawn out in such a way, which guarantees utmost satisfaction to the viewers. The background score by Jerry Goldsmith too had no problem whatsoever. The movie is highly recommended to the viewers who find solace in watching the movies relevant to the genres of mystery, thriller and crime.

    Bolstered by strong performances from its leading cast, brilliant script by Robert Towne and taut direction by Roman Polanski, Chinatown is one of the best offerings of the mystery genre. Jack Nicholson stars as private detective, J J Gittes and gives a really composed performance and is literally present in every single scene in this film. Faye Dunaway as Evelyn Mulwray puts up another strong performance to go neck to neck with Nicholson's work. But the real star of this film is its script & direction as Polanski's steady work behind the camera & Towne's sturdy script are works of pure craftsmanship and carries no complains. An engaging drama promising a lot of surprises & uncertainty throughout its runtime which finally ends with a soul-shattering climaxÂ… that's Chinatown for you.

    "You may think you know what you're dealing with, but, believe me, you don't." Sometimes things are bigger than ourselves, and despite how much we think we can change the world eventually we are brought down to our reality: we are much smaller than we think we are and there is little we can do against the big corporate giants. That is the main theme that director, Roman Polanski, is trying to explore here in this criminal film noir thriller starring Jack Nicholson as a wise and overly confident private detective who is about to learn that despite how much he wants to teach the bad guys a lesson perhaps things are a little out of his league. That is why the film is titled Chinatown, because it represents a time in Jake's (Nicholson's character) life where he wasn't able to make a difference in the police force and became cynical towards the world. "Forget it, Jake, it's Chinatown" is what they told him, and that is why he decided to retire and become a private investigator working on his own. He doesn't want to forget it, he wants to catch the bad guys and balance things out. He doesn't want these rich executives to continue thinking they can get away with anything. That is exactly why he decides to investigate things on his own and begins to enter dangerous territory where not everyone is who they say they are. He slowly begins to uncover one lie after another, and that is what makes Chinatown such an entertaining and masterful thriller. We are part of the investigation and begin discovering things at the same time Jake does. We are as confident as he is that he is going to uncover everything. This is Jack Nicholson's movie from the opening scene and he delivers one of his best performances to date. Faye Dunaway is also interesting in her femme fatale role; we are never sure if we can trust her or not. Polanski has delivered a perfect homage to the 40's film noir thrillers. Chinatown will remain as one of the best classical films of all time. This is my favorite Polanski film, perfect in every way. Jake Gittes seems to be doing well as a private detective in Los Angeles, since he specializes in infidelities and there are many in the city. His latest assignment is to follow Evelyn Mulwray's (Diane Ladd) husband who happens to be the builder of the city's water supply system. His name is Hollis (Darrell Zwerling) and he is fascinated with everything that has to do with water, but Evelyn is convinced he is having an affair. Jake accepts the job and begins following Hollis, and surely enough he photographs him with a younger woman causing a scandal in the city. Jake believes his job is done, until a Mrs. Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) comes thundering into his office claiming that she had never hired him to follow her husband. Apparently the first woman claiming to be Mrs. Mulwray was only an impersonator and now Jake has a law suit in his hands. Surprisingly Mrs. Mulwray drops the law suit a few days later, and her husband is found dead after an apparent suicide. Jake is now hired by Mrs. Mulwray to discover who might have wanted her husband dead, and soon Jake will find himself uncovering an entire web of deceit and corruption that is much bigger than he thinks. This masterful film was nominated for 11 Academy Awards, but only won one (Best Original Screenplay written by Robert Towne) considering it had to compete in 1975 with another perfect film: The Godfather Part II. One of the best things about Chinatown actually is the screenplay. There are so many great dialogues and quotes from this film that are still remembered today almost 40 years later. Chinatown is exactly what a classical film looks like. Polanski created a masterpiece by recreating the classic film noir from the 40's with great art direction, costume designs, and cinematography. The editing and the original score are also done wonderfully, but none of this would be enough if it weren't for the wonderful performances from Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway. Chinatown deserves all the praise it has received over time and it has really turned into a timeless classic and one of the few that continues to astonish modern audiences. The twists and surprises in Chinatown continue to work today.

    What a fantastic crime thriller from Roman Polanski. Chinatown is superbly acted, very stylish and contains a mysterious story that will keep you enthralled until the end. There are several shocking and disturbing moments, which were delivered quite effectively throughout the film. The score is done pretty well and helps propelling the intensity in a lot of scenes. I was constantly entertained and intrigued by Jack Nicholson's character as he's a sarcastic, witty and persistent detective. Faye Dunaway and John Huston are other highlights and delivered excellent performances as well. I was really moved by its haunting ending and shocked by the main twist presented earlier in the film. Chinatown is certainly one of the best American noirs ever made and I highly recommend it.

    The Los Angeles District Attorney tells cops in Chinatown to do "as little as possible." When detective Jake Gittes was on that beat, the DA used to tell him "you may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't." There isn't much doubt about what happened to Jake in Chinatown back then. Trying to prevent it from happening, he explains, had only assured that it would. It would have been better to have done nothing at all. He gives that advice to at least one prospective patron of his private eye business when she comes to him with a concern about her cheating husband. "Go home and forget everything," he says, and for once this sarcastic, confident, inquisitive detective seems sincere and tired and sad. This line of work is how he makes his living, but he isn't out to see anyone get hurt. He takes the case, of course, and follows it where it leads, which is to a place where he can do nothing to prevent those who know too little from doing too much. Maybe he should have just gone home and forgotten everything, but then we wouldn't have Robert Towne's deft, classic screenplay.

    As I wrote the title to this post, the year "1974" flashed before my eyes in terms of my opinion of the highly respected film Chinatown. I've now seen this film twice, the first time I "convinced" myself it to love it no matter what I actually thought of it, knowing how highly regarded screenplay is in the movie industry. Honestly, I felt the film's pacing was a dud and Nicholson didn't work as the leading character. The screenplay was fine, but I felt like I was going to drown in my own saliva from falling asleep in this boring movie. I rewatched the film knowing where the story is going and having a firm grip on the plot and came out drinking the Chinatown cool-aid. My most substantial complaints of my first viewing of Chinatown, pacing aside, was the disappointment I felt in Jack Nicholson's performance. I before thought he was playing himself as a detective. Jack Nicholson the Detective, not J.J. Gittes, which is frustrating and awkward to watch. On second viewing, I took to Nicholson's performance more, he's serviceable with a few moments of finesse. When Nicholson is put in "hammy" scenes, I feel like it's only Jack Nicholson that appears most times. Maybe that's why his work in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is the best work of his career. He gets to play the eccentric character that he is in real life. Faye Dunaway emerges as the heroine grounded in mystery. Her character has layers that Dunaway is allowed to slowly peal off, each layer making sense from what we know about the layer prior. Chinatown is essentially a neo-film noir of its time, and Dunaway fits the bill of a noir heroine to a tee. Set in the 1930s, Chiantown features some wonderful costumes, sets, and cinematography that add to that era and the noir-feeling of the picture. The film score helps the picture set its wonderful tone, also. Roman Polanski is the man I have any kind of a beef with when it comes to Chinatown. Polanski excels at creating the rush for viewers in the second half of the film, but Chinatown's blinding flaw is that the first hour, Polanski lets the picture flat-line. The information we're given in the first hour makes sense at the end of the movie, we need to see these crucial scenes, but Polanski doesn't help make these overreaching plot arc scenes lively enough to keep me interested. The first hour succeeds on all levels, with the huge exception of the lackadaisical directing. The second half, Polanski shifts the film into drive, stomps on the gas petal and makes amends for the first hour's glacial pacing. Finally, what makes Chinatown "Chinatown".....the marvelous screenplay. Robert Towney penned the screenplay, which revived the noir-genre in the 1970s. Not only that, but Towney scribed a manicured script that had thick character development and a serpentine plot that keeps unfolding in your mind even after the movie has concluded. People probably confuse themselves searching for the allegory to bigger things in Chinatown's script, however, literary devices aren't why Chinatown is a step above most screenplays ever written. It's brilliant in the communication to the audience, keeping the audience under water in the mysteries (we're introduced to one big mystery to learn about multiple others in solving the one at hand) of Chinatown and the multiples secrets the characters conceal about their past. Chinatown opens its film in a odd fashion and goes against the formula of film noir anatomy with its first twenty minutes. It's very carefully plotted and tricky to comprehend at first. But then a mystery unfolds that's one of the most satisfying and involved conclusions to a mystery story. Filled to the brim with fine performances and wonderful decor, if you're willing to be patient and relinquish your full attention to the plot, Chinatown is a movie that resonates and unrolls in your mind. The more I've thought about the intelligence behind the film, the closer Chinatown is to getting a perfect from me. Rating: 9.5/10 Grade: A

    Almost 40 years later this movie has lost none of its power to affect. It uses the trappings of a fedora-sporting detective (Jack Nicholson), on the trail of a mystery he doesn't realize he does not want to unravel, to tell a drama of a family destroyed by horrific deeds and secrets. The story remains timeless, ultimately, due to its illumination of the best and worst within us - and that enormous valley where most of us, like detective Jake Gittes, fall - somewhere in between. I won't give away any story, but to give you some idea how powerful this is, I was never able to enjoy John Huston acting in a movie ever again because of his portrayal here (Noah Cross). The revelatory scene between Gittes and Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) retains its power to shock and disturb. What makes this so potent, really, is the screenplay by Robert Towne. It's powerful in ways many movies never reach; and maybe no one writes more realistic dialogue than Towne. The unsavory parts of the story are redeemed by the positive we get from Evelyn Mulwray, and her determination to carry on. Although the story doesn't end with her walking away victorious, her perseverance is really the heart of this tale. 20 years earlier this story could never have been told in a Hollywood movie; the excellence of this one movie - "Chinatown" - makes that entire fight to loosen censorship worthwhile.

    What I love about movies that come from the New Hollywood genres is their quality of elegance that make these pictures into something special that cannot be captured ever again. Whether it is the clean look in the visuals or its technique of not going with all the bare details in story or its characters. That certain mystique is especially captured so beautifully in 'Chinatown.' It's a story that pulls you into a big mystery, but ultimately it feels like the town is full of mysteries. One thing I have to say I love is the effectiveness of the title, in that after watching the movie it finally takes on the true colors of what the movie is about and really gives meaning to what is disturbing about what I just witnessed on screen. And I'll leave it at that. I could go on about the acting performances that really give strength to the film. All I could say is that the collaborative effort of the creation of the story, its characters and its atmosphere all culminate in creating a movie that is truly dark and brooding. It's basically a movie that will stick with you. This is probably a horrible review, but I guess I just want to let anyone know who might read this that this is a classic.
