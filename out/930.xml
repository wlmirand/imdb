 <sinopse>
  Two researchers in a green alternative energy project are put on the run when they are framed for murder and treason.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Eddie Kasalivich, an undergraduate at the University of Chicago, works as a technician for a scientific team that discovers an alternative, low-cost, pollution-free fuel source. When one of the chief scientists is murdered and the invention stolen, Eddie and physicist Lily Sinclair are framed for it and have to flee for their lives, with the FBI, CIA and other involved parties in close pursuit. Paul Shannon, Eddies mentor, is the director of a scientific company which - unknown to Eddie - has commercial interests in the invention. Eddie and Lily set out to find the stolen invention and hopefully clear themselves of the false charges.

    Action Director Andy Davis should stay away from Films that have very deep Sociological implications and Heartfelt Left-Wing Idealism and stick to Movies that are "only" Entertainment. Because the Theme here is just too important and is a matter of Life and Death for the Planet. There are timely and difficult Problems to be solved and here the "fact" that water can be used as a cheap and effective means of Energy is most likely, in the near future, exactly what will be discovered. Its not that complicated at its base. Hydrogen is two parts in the water and it is highly Fissionable and is clean when burned. So look for it coming soon, if they let it, but if the Greed and Control in History is any indication, don't sell your Oil Stocks. But here it is nothing more than the substantial backdrop to the Story and is drained of it Power and used almost as a McGuffin. There is also the disturbing and inevitable Truth that if a source of Free Energy is discovered, the Power Elite will suppress it and destroy anything or anybody who would stop them from keeping it for themselves. It is dangerous being Green. The Movie utilizes these two profound Truths, one undeniable (Suppression) and the other almost a certainty (Clean Free Energy), but the whole thing feels like it is running on Empty. But as an Action Movie it is pretty good and is Entertaining and a lot of fun. But that painful Back Story is just too sensitive to be relegated to just another forgettable Popcorn Romp.

    I found reviews for this film on IMDb confusing and wondered whether people had watched the same film as me. One reviewer said that the film doesn't mention sonoluminescence (it does, explicitly), others say that certain things aren't explained ie the explosion in the warehouse. Well d'uh! Hydrogen is not an inert gas and is highly flammable (mentioned a LOT in the film) and people complain about lack of plot then demonstrate they didn't understand it anyway! Chain Reaction is a science-heavy sci-fi chase film where two people who barely know each other are framed for something they didn't do and go on the run. Suspension of "why didn't they just go to the FBI and explain" aside, it's a ripping good fairly intelligent yarn which isn't dumbed down so it's not all spelled out, especially Shannon's character (Morgan Freeman) who throughout is ambiguous in who's side he is actually on. Aspects of the story are insidious - an environmentally friendly fuel that would revolutionise the world and a Government Agency wants to suppress it and an idealist is labelled a dreamer for wanting to make a difference. It's isn't too hard to believe that is a possible scenario. Okay some of the acting is a little cheesy but overall the performances were perfectly fine. Freeman of course is superior. Dr Alistair Barkley (Nicholas Rudall) was also a lovely actor and character, although not well known, and his monologue at the beginning is just superb and emotive - clearly the writing/screenplay was very good except for the repetition of everyone's names during conversation, that really gets on my nerves. The plot is as simple or as complex as you want. On the surface it's a simple on the run film, but the political conspiracy aspects and science-stuff make it a deeper story, which not being spelled out adds to the mystery. Reeves of course is excellent at the action, and plays resourceful convincingly and easily; I liked his dogged determination to rescue Lily and clear their names. Rachel Weisz's Physicist the "too serious Lily" is a bit weak, a bit of a drag on the survival given that everything is done for her but perhaps that is more realistic, women don't miraculously turn into gung-ho running leaping shooting and fighting survivalists, but I do expect her to do something but her emotions are very real especially regarding Chen (Tzi Ma). Whilst you see a potential romance on the cards for Eddie and Lily it's nice that the screenplay doesn't dwell on it, and the focus of the plot given the lack of time and Eddie Kasalivich being a gentleman. The SFX in the film are good, especially the explosions, and I'm betting Reeves does his own bike stunts. There are many stunts which are pretty good but they are within the bounds of realism - and this is generally why the characters are relatable and convincing. It's got a tense crescendo to how it runs out, and it's entertaining and adult without resorting to bad language and gratuitous violence - I would consider it almost a family film (older family). I'm not saying it's the best film every made, but I like all aspects of it to have seen it a number of times. I think some people try and read too much into the science, it's not supposed to be an episode of the Open University, it's just a science-fiction that isn't too far from feasible possibility. Just sit back and enjoy for some entertainment.

    Keanu Reeves, Morgan Freeman, and Rachel Weisz are involved in a "Chain Reaction" in this 1996 film, directed by Andrew Davis, who also directed "The Fugitive." There are some plot similarities, but then, there are also plot similarities to many other films. Reeves plays Eddie, a young man who is part of a team working toward clean, free energy, - obviously, a highly-prized entity by many people. On the night their work actually pays off, and their experiment is a success, the team has a huge party. Later, an unknown faction basically destroys the building, wiping out eight city blocks. Eddie, who was returning to the building to pick up his motorcycle after seeing the tipsy Lily (Weisz) home, ends up being framed and goes on the run with Lily. Everyone is after them, especially after a police officer is killed, for which Eddie is blamed. This film had fantastic effects, imaginative stunts, and decent performances, with Rachel Weisz being wasted in an extraneous role. Freeman's character is deliberately ambiguous, and he does a good job at keeping us guessing. Handsome Keanu Reeves, not really a great actor, is nevertheless not a bad actor either, so he is able to hold his own. I don't mind a film being derivative, but my basic problem with this one occurs at the beginning. For me there just wasn't enough set-up. I understand that producers today want all the action to start a few minutes into the film, but there was not enough development in the beginning to attach us to this massive project and the people working on it. An extra five minutes would have been fine. Entertaining, a good rental.

    I'm a big Keanu Reeves fan but I won't be watching this film again in a hurry. This is one of those films where you ask why did they bother doing a Blu-ray release? This is primarily a chase film and there are several cinematic scenes that would be worth it if they were only shot at a wider angle. The soundtrack is a horrible, bargain basement, clich&eacute; score with no tracks to invigorate the film. What this film really lacks is a Tommy Lee Jones level character to do the chasing like in "The Fugitive" and "U.S. Marshals". Instead we are left with a mixture a baddies and cops with a 90's made-for-TV feel to them. This is somewhat surprising as director Andrew Davis helmed "The Fugitive" This film is notable as being Rachel Weisz's breakthrough role but the film sadly lacks the talent, humour and charisma evident in her subsequent roles. Most notably of these is where she teams up with Keanu again for one of my all time favourite films: "Constantine". The science fiction element of this film is negligible and will disappoint sci-fi fans. I would recommend rather watching "Johnny Mnemonic" or "The Matrix". However the concept of the story is very relevant. A new power source like Cold Fusion would be a major economic and political game changer. The constant chase scenes distract from the underlying government conspiracy story, which could easily have been better fleshed out to give us a film more on the level of "Sneakers". There is a good storyline to this film. Unfortunately the elements of the production let film down despite the presence of Keanu Reeves and Morgan Freeman.

    Simply put, one of my favorite movies of the 90s, because I'm a big fan of the Fugitive. This plot follows it adds a bit of a new age spin on it. Enjoyable flick with very good actors and a cast that features Keanu Reeves, Morgan Freeman, Fred Ward, Brian Cox, Rachel Weisz and many others, highly recommended if you're a fan of the Fugitive or U.S. Marshalls! The story is about a chemist & his friend suspected of murdering their mentor and Reeves & Weisz receive help from a friend of their fallen colleague and they try and find out who is trying to frame them for murder. Much like The Fugitive, which ironically is done by most of the same crew and features some of the actors from that film, it's a great flick to pass the time on.

    Just watched the big budget CHAIN REACTION on the Reelz channel, and it all made for a very underwhelming Sat. night. Some sort of convoluted plot about alternative fuel which didn't make a whole bunch of sense was the back drop to Keanu Reeves & Rachel Weisz running everywhere around Chicago and So. Wisconsin in January of 1996. It certainly was fun picking out Chicago bit actors of the era, including Chelcie Ross, a very young and skinny Michael Shannon (or as I know him now, Nelson Van Alden from "Boardwalk Empire"), John Cusack's late father, and even a couple of CBS2 Chicago veteran investigative reporters, Pam Zekman and John Drummond. The best parts were the location shots at Williams Bay on frozen Lake Geneva Wisc., including the inside of the Yerkes Observatory and Keanu spinning around on an "everglades like" hovercraft just missing some 'Sconnie fish houses. But all in all, I'd say take a pass on CHAIN REACTION unless nothing else is on.

    Eddie Kasalivich is a student machinist working on a project at the University of Chicago to obtain energy from water, when he discovers the secret of a process by which low-cost energy can be obtained from burning hydrogen, leaving only water as a residue. (The exact science is not always clear, but this appears to be some sort of nuclear fusion). Someone, however, obviously wants to sabotage Eddie's discovery, and one of his colleagues is murdered and the laboratory is destroyed in a massive explosion. Eddie and another colleague, Dr. Lily Sinclair, are questioned by the police and the FBI, and quickly realise that someone is trying to frame them for both the murder and the explosion. They are forced to go on the run to try and clear their names and to expose the true culprits. It is not just the science upon which the film is based that is unclear; the plot too is often over-elaborate and difficult to fathom. We eventually learn that the real villains are agents of the Government and of Big Business, who are desperate to suppress Eddie's discovery because they fear that a new cheap, environmentally friendly source of energy would make oil obsolete, force all oil companies into bankruptcy and lead to economic depression and social chaos. In fact, capitalism is rather more adaptable than the screenwriters imagine; a new energy source of this nature, by dramatically reducing industry's energy costs, would more likely lead to an economic boom and huge profits for those companies who could exploit this lucrative new technology. Existing energy companies would probably be among them, just as many stagecoach owners made a fortune from the invention of the steam train by re-investing their money in railway shares. The only people with a vested interest in preventing such inventions reaching the market would be the governments of those countries which possess vast reservoirs of crude oil and very little else, but the film-makers doubtless thought that, in paranoid conspiracy-thrillers like this one, the United States Government makes a better villain than do foreign ones. Keanu Reeves's performance as Eddie is adequate but not outstanding. Rachel Weisz as Lily, in her first starring role in a Hollywood film, is rather muted, and gives little indication that she would later develop into a major talent. Probably the best acting comes from the generally reliable Morgan Freeman as Paul Shannon, Eddie's old mentor who may have a sinister agenda, but "Chain Reaction" is not one of the really great Freeman films like "Glory", "Unforgiven" or "The Shawshank Redemption". The film does have some better qualities. The director Andrew Davis has been praised by his visual sense, and "Chain Reaction" is visually very attractive. The action takes place in winter and there is some striking photography of a wintry, snow-bound Chicago, especially the scenes set in the grim industrial districts and around the astronomical observatory which plays an important part in the plot. The action sequences are exciting, fast-moving and well handled. Davis has a reputation for specialising in thrillers. His films tend to vary in quality, but he has at least one very good one to his credit, "The Fugitive", one of the best thrillers of the nineties. (That film also dealt with a man forced to go on the run after being falsely accused of a crime). "Chain Reaction" is not in the same class as "The Fugitive", but it is a watchable thriller with some points of interest. 6/10

    When the scientist leading the search for a new low cost energy source announces that he intends to give the discovery to the world he is looked on as a bit of an idealist but when a breakthrough leads to the energy source's discovery things quickly go bad for his team; he is murdered and his lab totally destroyed; another of his team vanishes, presumed to have taken stolen data to China and another two; Eddie Kasalivich, the man who made the breakthrough and Dr. Lily Sinclair, a physicist on the team find themselves on the run having been framed for murder and selling the data. The only man they think they can trust is Eddie's mentor Paul Shannon but he is in no position as the FBI are watching him almost as keenly as they are watching Eddie and Lily. If they are to survive they will have to get out of Chicago and find a safe way to meet Shannon; all the time avoiding various law enforcement agencies and more dangerous characters working for the shadowy organisation that killed the scientist and destroyed his lab. While this is hardly a classic thriller it is a lot of fun; there are impressive explosions, numerous chases, shootings and a constant sense that our protagonists could be caught, or worse, at any moment. Keanu Reaves does a decent job as Eddie and Rachel Weiss is fine as Lily; however it is Morgan Freeman who dominates proceedings as Shannon; a man we aren't sure whether or not can be trusted for much of the film. Brian Cox also puts in a fun performance as the obvious villain Lyman Collier. The story itself is fairly silly but it is well told and there should be enough action and suspense to keep most viewers entertained well enough. I wouldn't say this is a must see film but it is worth watching if it is on television and there is nothing better on.

    Apart from being a great action flick Chain Reaction also has a plot that is quite intelligent and realistic. With the ever-increasing efforts of powers that be to control everything from information to technology, this movie offers us a plausible scenario with convincing actors, well and there's Keanu. Shot in a style of classic nineties action flicks it has wild chases, explosions and fire fights and pretty damsel in distress (Rachel Weisz). This is the genre in which Keanu Reaves is the best, and when we add Morgan Freeman to the equation we got the strength and charm combined with smarts. Not to mention stunning Rachel Weisz in one of her early roles, establishing herself as an action heroine. Although being an action flick Chain Reaction is one of those movies that relaxes, you can just let go of your worries and enjoy in an almost sci-fi atmosphere and interesting plot. Eddie Kasalivich is a part of a scientific team that is on a verge to discover the process that transforms water into fuel. Of course if this should happen, global economy and almost everything else would be instantly changed forever, so the stakes are quite high. After they succeeded in the experiment, things start to get ugly as one of the scientist is killed and Eddie and physicist Lily Sinclair are framed for the murder. With the machine stolen and them on the run from the authorities Eddie and Lily are in a quite a pickle. Soon they discover a conspiracy that involves some unlikely suspects. Will they manage to escape and clear their name while trying to tell the world about their discovery is up to you to find out

    Another good Keanu Reeves(as a machinist) thriller, and I must say the starcast is sexy! There's Rachel Weisz(a fellow scientist), Morgan Freeman(funds a secret science project), Brian Cox(as chairman of a secret research facility) and also Fred Ward(as FBI agent). I actually thought Chain Reaction would be a sci-fi thriller, but the sci-fi part isn't really there. We've only the beginning and the ending scene where some hydrogen reaction is shown. Rest of the movie is all about catch Keanu if you can! Rachel & he flees the cops, the FBI and some operatives intend on killing them while they try to expose the murky truth. Keanu, Rachel, Morgan and even Brian Cox are good. Also very good special effects, especially the massive explosion in the beginning which paves the way for the excitement that follows. Some of the disappointments included the ending bits. Keanu seems to easily find his way to a secret, heavily-guarded research facility, to not only rescue Rachel Weisz but also bring the entire kilometres-long facility crashing down to earth! That wasn't convincing. And also Rachel had a really weak role, as compared to Keanu or Morgan. Maybe that was the beginning phase of her career. Of course, it also bewilders me that Keanu also easily finds answers to fix the chemical reactions or even set it to explode if our bad guys don't turn back! I think I risk disliking the movie if I ask too many questions :p Verdict: Just leave your questions unanswered. You could like the movie & the suspense that way :-)

Enjoyable flick with very good actors and a cast that features Keanu Reeves, Morgan Freeman, Fred Ward, Brian Cox, Rachel Weisz and many others, highly recommended if you're a fan of the Fugitive or U.S. Marshalls! The story is about a chemist & his friend suspected of murdering their mentor and Reeves & Weisz receive help from a friend of their fallen colleague and they try and find out who is trying to frame them for murder. Much like The Fugitive, which ironically is done by most of the same crew and features some of the actors from that film, it's a great flick to pass the time on.

    Just watched the big budget CHAIN REACTION on the Reelz channel, and it all made for a very underwhelming Sat. night. Some sort of convoluted plot about alternative fuel which didn't make a whole bunch of sense was the back drop to Keanu Reeves & Rachel Weisz running everywhere around Chicago and So. Wisconsin in January of 1996. It certainly was fun picking out Chicago bit actors of the era, including Chelcie Ross, a very young and skinny Michael Shannon (or as I know him now, Nelson Van Alden from "Boardwalk Empire"), John Cusack's late father, and even a couple of CBS2 Chicago veteran investigative reporters, Pam Zekman and John Drummond. The best parts were the location shots at Williams Bay on frozen Lake Geneva Wisc., including the inside of the Yerkes Observatory and Keanu spinning around on an "everglades like" hovercraft just missing some 'Sconnie fish houses. But all in all, I'd say take a pass on CHAIN REACTION unless nothing else is on.

    Eddie Kasalivich is a student machinist working on a project at the University of Chicago to obtain energy from water, when he discovers the secret of a process by which low-cost energy can be obtained from burning hydrogen, leaving only water as a residue. (The exact science is not always clear, but this appears to be some sort of nuclear fusion). Someone, however, obviously wants to sabotage Eddie's discovery, and one of his colleagues is murdered and the laboratory is destroyed in a massive explosion. Eddie and another colleague, Dr. Lily Sinclair, are questioned by the police and the FBI, and quickly realise that someone is trying to frame them for both the murder and the explosion. They are forced to go on the run to try and clear their names and to expose the true culprits. It is not just the science upon which the film is based that is unclear; the plot too is often over-elaborate and difficult to fathom. We eventually learn that the real villains are agents of the Government and of Big Business, who are desperate to suppress Eddie's discovery because they fear that a new cheap, environmentally friendly source of energy would make oil obsolete, force all oil companies into bankruptcy and lead to economic depression and social chaos. In fact, capitalism is rather more adaptable than the screenwriters imagine; a new energy source of this nature, by dramatically reducing industry's energy costs, would more likely lead to an economic boom and huge profits for those companies who could exploit this lucrative new technology. Existing energy companies would probably be among them, just as many stagecoach owners made a fortune from the invention of the steam train by re-investing their money in railway shares. The only people with a vested interest in preventing such inventions reaching the market would be the governments of those countries which possess vast reservoirs of crude oil and very little else, but the film-makers doubtless thought that, in paranoid conspiracy-thrillers like this one, the United States Government makes a better villain than do foreign ones. Keanu Reeves's performance as Eddie is adequate but not outstanding. Rachel Weisz as Lily, in her first starring role in a Hollywood film, is rather muted, and gives little indication that she would later develop into a major talent. Probably the best acting comes from the generally reliable Morgan Freeman as Paul Shannon, Eddie's old mentor who may have a sinister agenda, but "Chain Reaction" is not one of the really great Freeman films like "Glory", "Unforgiven" or "The Shawshank Redemption". The film does have some better qualities. The director Andrew Davis has been praised by his visual sense, and "Chain Reaction" is visually very attractive. The action takes place in winter and there is some striking photography of a wintry, snow-bound Chicago, especially the scenes set in the grim industrial districts and around the astronomical observatory which plays an important part in the plot. The action sequences are exciting, fast-moving and well handled. Davis has a reputation for specialising in thrillers. His films tend to vary in quality, but he has at least one very good one to his credit, "The Fugitive", one of the best thrillers of the nineties. (That film also dealt with a man forced to go on the run after being falsely accused of a crime). "Chain Reaction" is not in the same class as "The Fugitive", but it is a watchable thriller with some points of interest. 6/10

    When the scientist leading the search for a new low cost energy source announces that he intends to give the discovery to the world he is looked on as a bit of an idealist but when a breakthrough leads to the energy source's discovery things quickly go bad for his team; he is murdered and his lab totally destroyed; another of his team vanishes, presumed to have taken stolen data to China and another two; Eddie Kasalivich, the man who made the breakthrough and Dr. Lily Sinclair, a physicist on the team find themselves on the run having been framed for murder and selling the data. The only man they think they can trust is Eddie's mentor Paul Shannon but he is in no position as the FBI are watching him almost as keenly as they are watching Eddie and Lily. If they are to survive they will have to get out of Chicago and find a safe way to meet Shannon; all the time avoiding various law enforcement agencies and more dangerous characters working for the shadowy organisation that killed the scientist and destroyed his lab. While this is hardly a classic thriller it is a lot of fun; there are impressive explosions, numerous chases, shootings and a constant sense that our protagonists could be caught, or worse, at any moment. Keanu Reaves does a decent job as Eddie and Rachel Weiss is fine as Lily; however it is Morgan Freeman who dominates proceedings as Shannon; a man we aren't sure whether or not can be trusted for much of the film. Brian Cox also puts in a fun performance as the obvious villain Lyman Collier. The story itself is fairly silly but it is well told and there should be enough action and suspense to keep most viewers entertained well enough. I wouldn't say this is a must see film but it is worth watching if it is on television and there is nothing better on.

    Apart from being a great action flick Chain Reaction also has a plot that is quite intelligent and realistic. With the ever-increasing efforts of powers that be to control everything from information to technology, this movie offers us a plausible scenario with convincing actors, well and there's Keanu. Shot in a style of classic nineties action flicks it has wild chases, explosions and fire fights and pretty damsel in distress (Rachel Weisz). This is the genre in which Keanu Reaves is the best, and when we add Morgan Freeman to the equation we got the strength and charm combined with smarts. Not to mention stunning Rachel Weisz in one of her early roles, establishing herself as an action heroine. Although being an action flick Chain Reaction is one of those movies that relaxes, you can just let go of your worries and enjoy in an almost sci-fi atmosphere and interesting plot. Eddie Kasalivich is a part of a scientific team that is on a verge to discover the process that transforms water into fuel. Of course if this should happen, global economy and almost everything else would be instantly changed forever, so the stakes are quite high. After they succeeded in the experiment, things start to get ugly as one of the scientist is killed and Eddie and physicist Lily Sinclair are framed for the murder. With the machine stolen and them on the run from the authorities Eddie and Lily are in a quite a pickle. Soon they discover a conspiracy that involves some unlikely suspects. Will they manage to escape and clear their name while trying to tell the world about their discovery is up to you to find out

    Another good Keanu Reeves(as a machinist) thriller, and I must say the starcast is sexy! There's Rachel Weisz(a fellow scientist), Morgan Freeman(funds a secret science project), Brian Cox(as chairman of a secret research facility) and also Fred Ward(as FBI agent). I actually thought Chain Reaction would be a sci-fi thriller, but the sci-fi part isn't really there. We've only the beginning and the ending scene where some hydrogen reaction is shown. Rest of the movie is all about catch Keanu if you can! Rachel & he flees the cops, the FBI and some operatives intend on killing them while they try to expose the murky truth. Keanu, Rachel, Morgan and even Brian Cox are good. Also very good special effects, especially the massive explosion in the beginning which paves the way for the excitement that follows. Some of the disappointments included the ending bits. Keanu seems to easily find his way to a secret, heavily-guarded research facility, to not only rescue Rachel Weisz but also bring the entire kilometres-long facility crashing down to earth! That wasn't convincing. And also Rachel had a really weak role, as compared to Keanu or Morgan. Maybe that was the beginning phase of her career. Of course, it also bewilders me that Keanu also easily finds answers to fix the chemical reactions or even set it to explode if our bad guys don't turn back! I think I risk disliking the movie if I ask too many questions :p Verdict: Just leave your questions unanswered. You could like the movie & the suspense that way :-)

    Action Director Andy Davis should stay away from Films that have very deep Sociological implications and Heartfelt Left-Wing Idealism and stick to Movies that are "only" Entertainment. Because the Theme here is just too important and is a matter of Life and Death for the Planet. There are timely and difficult Problems to be solved and here the "fact" that water can be used as a cheap and effective means of Energy is most likely, in the near future, exactly what will be discovered. Its not that complicated at its base. Hydrogen is two parts in the water and it is highly Fissionable and is clean when burned. So look for it coming soon, if they let it, but if the Greed and Control in History is any indication, don't sell your Oil Stocks. But here it is nothing more than the substantial backdrop to the Story and is drained of it Power and used almost as a McGuffin. There is also the disturbing and inevitable Truth that if a source of Free Energy is discovered, the Power Elite will suppress it and destroy anything or anybody who would stop them from keeping it for themselves. It is dangerous being Green. The Movie utilizes these two profound Truths, one undeniable (Suppression) and the other almost a certainty (Clean Free Energy), but the whole thing feels like it is running on Empty. But as an Action Movie it is pretty good and is Entertaining and a lot of fun. But that painful Back Story is just too sensitive to be relegated to just another forgettable Popcorn Romp.

    I found reviews for this film on IMDb confusing and wondered whether people had watched the same film as me. One reviewer said that the film doesn't mention sonoluminescence (it does, explicitly), others say that certain things aren't explained ie the explosion in the warehouse. Well d'uh! Hydrogen is not an inert gas and is highly flammable (mentioned a LOT in the film) and people complain about lack of plot then demonstrate they didn't understand it anyway! Chain Reaction is a science-heavy sci-fi chase film where two people who barely know each other are framed for something they didn't do and go on the run. Suspension of "why didn't they just go to the FBI and explain" aside, it's a ripping good fairly intelligent yarn which isn't dumbed down so it's not all spelled out, especially Shannon's character (Morgan Freeman) who throughout is ambiguous in who's side he is actually on. Aspects of the story are insidious - an environmentally friendly fuel that would revolutionise the world and a Government Agency wants to suppress it and an idealist is labelled a dreamer for wanting to make a difference. It's isn't too hard to believe that is a possible scenario. Okay some of the acting is a little cheesy but overall the performances were perfectly fine. Freeman of course is superior. Dr Alistair Barkley (Nicholas Rudall) was also a lovely actor and character, although not well known, and his monologue at the beginning is just superb and emotive - clearly the writing/screenplay was very good except for the repetition of everyone's names during conversation, that really gets on my nerves. The plot is as simple or as complex as you want. On the surface it's a simple on the run film, but the political conspiracy aspects and science-stuff make it a deeper story, which not being spelled out adds to the mystery. Reeves of course is excellent at the action, and plays resourceful convincingly and easily; I liked his dogged determination to rescue Lily and clear their names. Rachel Weisz's Physicist the "too serious Lily" is a bit weak, a bit of a drag on the survival given that everything is done for her but perhaps that is more realistic, women don't miraculously turn into gung-ho running leaping shooting and fighting survivalists, but I do expect her to do something but her emotions are very real especially regarding Chen (Tzi Ma). Whilst you see a potential romance on the cards for Eddie and Lily it's nice that the screenplay doesn't dwell on it, and the focus of the plot given the lack of time and Eddie Kasalivich being a gentleman. The SFX in the film are good, especially the explosions, and I'm betting Reeves does his own bike stunts. There are many stunts which are pretty good but they are within the bounds of realism - and this is generally why the characters are relatable and convincing. It's got a tense crescendo to how it runs out, and it's entertaining and adult without resorting to bad language and gratuitous violence - I would consider it almost a family film (older family). I'm not saying it's the best film every made, but I like all aspects of it to have seen it a number of times. I think some people try and read too much into the science, it's not supposed to be an episode of the Open University, it's just a science-fiction that isn't too far from feasible possibility. Just sit back and enjoy for some entertainment.

    Keanu Reeves, Morgan Freeman, and Rachel Weisz are involved in a "Chain Reaction" in this 1996 film, directed by Andrew Davis, who also directed "The Fugitive." There are some plot similarities, but then, there are also plot similarities to many other films. Reeves plays Eddie, a young man who is part of a team working toward clean, free energy, - obviously, a highly-prized entity by many people. On the night their work actually pays off, and their experiment is a success, the team has a huge party. Later, an unknown faction basically destroys the building, wiping out eight city blocks. Eddie, who was returning to the building to pick up his motorcycle after seeing the tipsy Lily (Weisz) home, ends up being framed and goes on the run with Lily. Everyone is after them, especially after a police officer is killed, for which Eddie is blamed. This film had fantastic effects, imaginative stunts, and decent performances, with Rachel Weisz being wasted in an extraneous role. Freeman's character is deliberately ambiguous, and he does a good job at keeping us guessing. Handsome Keanu Reeves, not really a great actor, is nevertheless not a bad actor either, so he is able to hold his own. I don't mind a film being derivative, but my basic problem with this one occurs at the beginning. For me there just wasn't enough set-up. I understand that producers today want all the action to start a few minutes into the film, but there was not enough development in the beginning to attach us to this massive project and the people working on it. An extra five minutes would have been fine. Entertaining, a good rental.

    I'm a big Keanu Reeves fan but I won't be watching this film again in a hurry. This is one of those films where you ask why did they bother doing a Blu-ray release? This is primarily a chase film and there are several cinematic scenes that would be worth it if they were only shot at a wider angle. The soundtrack is a horrible, bargain basement, clich&eacute; score with no tracks to invigorate the film. What this film really lacks is a Tommy Lee Jones level character to do the chasing like in "The Fugitive" and "U.S. Marshals". Instead we are left with a mixture a baddies and cops with a 90's made-for-TV feel to them. This is somewhat surprising as director Andrew Davis helmed "The Fugitive" This film is notable as being Rachel Weisz's breakthrough role but the film sadly lacks the talent, humour and charisma evident in her subsequent roles. Most notably of these is where she teams up with Keanu again for one of my all time favourite films: "Constantine". The science fiction element of this film is negligible and will disappoint sci-fi fans. I would recommend rather watching "Johnny Mnemonic" or "The Matrix". However the concept of the story is very relevant. A new power source like Cold Fusion would be a major economic and political game changer. The constant chase scenes distract from the underlying government conspiracy story, which could easily have been better fleshed out to give us a film more on the level of "Sneakers". There is a good storyline to this film. Unfortunately the elements of the production let film down despite the presence of Keanu Reeves and Morgan Freeman.

So look for it coming soon, if they let it, but if the Greed and Control in History is any indication, don't sell your Oil Stocks. But here it is nothing more than the substantial backdrop to the Story and is drained of it Power and used almost as a McGuffin. There is also the disturbing and inevitable Truth that if a source of Free Energy is discovered, the Power Elite will suppress it and destroy anything or anybody who would stop them from keeping it for themselves. It is dangerous being Green. The Movie utilizes these two profound Truths, one undeniable (Suppression) and the other almost a certainty (Clean Free Energy), but the whole thing feels like it is running on Empty. But as an Action Movie it is pretty good and is Entertaining and a lot of fun. But that painful Back Story is just too sensitive to be relegated to just another forgettable Popcorn Romp.

    I found reviews for this film on IMDb confusing and wondered whether people had watched the same film as me. One reviewer said that the film doesn't mention sonoluminescence (it does, explicitly), others say that certain things aren't explained ie the explosion in the warehouse. Well d'uh! Hydrogen is not an inert gas and is highly flammable (mentioned a LOT in the film) and people complain about lack of plot then demonstrate they didn't understand it anyway! Chain Reaction is a science-heavy sci-fi chase film where two people who barely know each other are framed for something they didn't do and go on the run. Suspension of "why didn't they just go to the FBI and explain" aside, it's a ripping good fairly intelligent yarn which isn't dumbed down so it's not all spelled out, especially Shannon's character (Morgan Freeman) who throughout is ambiguous in who's side he is actually on. Aspects of the story are insidious - an environmentally friendly fuel that would revolutionise the world and a Government Agency wants to suppress it and an idealist is labelled a dreamer for wanting to make a difference. It's isn't too hard to believe that is a possible scenario. Okay some of the acting is a little cheesy but overall the performances were perfectly fine. Freeman of course is superior. Dr Alistair Barkley (Nicholas Rudall) was also a lovely actor and character, although not well known, and his monologue at the beginning is just superb and emotive - clearly the writing/screenplay was very good except for the repetition of everyone's names during conversation, that really gets on my nerves. The plot is as simple or as complex as you want. On the surface it's a simple on the run film, but the political conspiracy aspects and science-stuff make it a deeper story, which not being spelled out adds to the mystery. Reeves of course is excellent at the action, and plays resourceful convincingly and easily; I liked his dogged determination to rescue Lily and clear their names. Rachel Weisz's Physicist the "too serious Lily" is a bit weak, a bit of a drag on the survival given that everything is done for her but perhaps that is more realistic, women don't miraculously turn into gung-ho running leaping shooting and fighting survivalists, but I do expect her to do something but her emotions are very real especially regarding Chen (Tzi Ma). Whilst you see a potential romance on the cards for Eddie and Lily it's nice that the screenplay doesn't dwell on it, and the focus of the plot given the lack of time and Eddie Kasalivich being a gentleman. The SFX in the film are good, especially the explosions, and I'm betting Reeves does his own bike stunts. There are many stunts which are pretty good but they are within the bounds of realism - and this is generally why the characters are relatable and convincing. It's got a tense crescendo to how it runs out, and it's entertaining and adult without resorting to bad language and gratuitous violence - I would consider it almost a family film (older family). I'm not saying it's the best film every made, but I like all aspects of it to have seen it a number of times. I think some people try and read too much into the science, it's not supposed to be an episode of the Open University, it's just a science-fiction that isn't too far from feasible possibility. Just sit back and enjoy for some entertainment.

    Keanu Reeves, Morgan Freeman, and Rachel Weisz are involved in a "Chain Reaction" in this 1996 film, directed by Andrew Davis, who also directed "The Fugitive." There are some plot similarities, but then, there are also plot similarities to many other films. Reeves plays Eddie, a young man who is part of a team working toward clean, free energy, - obviously, a highly-prized entity by many people. On the night their work actually pays off, and their experiment is a success, the team has a huge party. Later, an unknown faction basically destroys the building, wiping out eight city blocks. Eddie, who was returning to the building to pick up his motorcycle after seeing the tipsy Lily (Weisz) home, ends up being framed and goes on the run with Lily. Everyone is after them, especially after a police officer is killed, for which Eddie is blamed. This film had fantastic effects, imaginative stunts, and decent performances, with Rachel Weisz being wasted in an extraneous role. Freeman's character is deliberately ambiguous, and he does a good job at keeping us guessing. Handsome Keanu Reeves, not really a great actor, is nevertheless not a bad actor either, so he is able to hold his own. I don't mind a film being derivative, but my basic problem with this one occurs at the beginning. For me there just wasn't enough set-up. I understand that producers today want all the action to start a few minutes into the film, but there was not enough development in the beginning to attach us to this massive project and the people working on it. An extra five minutes would have been fine. Entertaining, a good rental.

    I'm a big Keanu Reeves fan but I won't be watching this film again in a hurry. This is one of those films where you ask why did they bother doing a Blu-ray release? This is primarily a chase film and there are several cinematic scenes that would be worth it if they were only shot at a wider angle. The soundtrack is a horrible, bargain basement, clich&eacute; score with no tracks to invigorate the film. What this film really lacks is a Tommy Lee Jones level character to do the chasing like in "The Fugitive" and "U.S. Marshals". Instead we are left with a mixture a baddies and cops with a 90's made-for-TV feel to them. This is somewhat surprising as director Andrew Davis helmed "The Fugitive" This film is notable as being Rachel Weisz's breakthrough role but the film sadly lacks the talent, humour and charisma evident in her subsequent roles. Most notably of these is where she teams up with Keanu again for one of my all time favourite films: "Constantine". The science fiction element of this film is negligible and will disappoint sci-fi fans. I would recommend rather watching "Johnny Mnemonic" or "The Matrix". However the concept of the story is very relevant. A new power source like Cold Fusion would be a major economic and political game changer. The constant chase scenes distract from the underlying government conspiracy story, which could easily have been better fleshed out to give us a film more on the level of "Sneakers". There is a good storyline to this film. Unfortunately the elements of the production let film down despite the presence of Keanu Reeves and Morgan Freeman.

    Simply put, one of my favorite movies of the 90s, because I'm a big fan of the Fugitive. This plot follows it adds a bit of a new age spin on it. Enjoyable flick with very good actors and a cast that features Keanu Reeves, Morgan Freeman, Fred Ward, Brian Cox, Rachel Weisz and many others, highly recommended if you're a fan of the Fugitive or U.S. Marshalls! The story is about a chemist & his friend suspected of murdering their mentor and Reeves & Weisz receive help from a friend of their fallen colleague and they try and find out who is trying to frame them for murder. Much like The Fugitive, which ironically is done by most of the same crew and features some of the actors from that film, it's a great flick to pass the time on.

    Just watched the big budget CHAIN REACTION on the Reelz channel, and it all made for a very underwhelming Sat. night. Some sort of convoluted plot about alternative fuel which didn't make a whole bunch of sense was the back drop to Keanu Reeves & Rachel Weisz running everywhere around Chicago and So. Wisconsin in January of 1996. It certainly was fun picking out Chicago bit actors of the era, including Chelcie Ross, a very young and skinny Michael Shannon (or as I know him now, Nelson Van Alden from "Boardwalk Empire"), John Cusack's late father, and even a couple of CBS2 Chicago veteran investigative reporters, Pam Zekman and John Drummond. The best parts were the location shots at Williams Bay on frozen Lake Geneva Wisc., including the inside of the Yerkes Observatory and Keanu spinning around on an "everglades like" hovercraft just missing some 'Sconnie fish houses. But all in all, I'd say take a pass on CHAIN REACTION unless nothing else is on.

    Eddie Kasalivich is a student machinist working on a project at the University of Chicago to obtain energy from water, when he discovers the secret of a process by which low-cost energy can be obtained from burning hydrogen, leaving only water as a residue. (The exact science is not always clear, but this appears to be some sort of nuclear fusion). Someone, however, obviously wants to sabotage Eddie's discovery, and one of his colleagues is murdered and the laboratory is destroyed in a massive explosion. Eddie and another colleague, Dr. Lily Sinclair, are questioned by the police and the FBI, and quickly realise that someone is trying to frame them for both the murder and the explosion. They are forced to go on the run to try and clear their names and to expose the true culprits. It is not just the science upon which the film is based that is unclear; the plot too is often over-elaborate and difficult to fathom. We eventually learn that the real villains are agents of the Government and of Big Business, who are desperate to suppress Eddie's discovery because they fear that a new cheap, environmentally friendly source of energy would make oil obsolete, force all oil companies into bankruptcy and lead to economic depression and social chaos. In fact, capitalism is rather more adaptable than the screenwriters imagine; a new energy source of this nature, by dramatically reducing industry's energy costs, would more likely lead to an economic boom and huge profits for those companies who could exploit this lucrative new technology. Existing energy companies would probably be among them, just as many stagecoach owners made a fortune from the invention of the steam train by re-investing their money in railway shares. The only people with a vested interest in preventing such inventions reaching the market would be the governments of those countries which possess vast reservoirs of crude oil and very little else, but the film-makers doubtless thought that, in paranoid conspiracy-thrillers like this one, the United States Government makes a better villain than do foreign ones. Keanu Reeves's performance as Eddie is adequate but not outstanding. Rachel Weisz as Lily, in her first starring role in a Hollywood film, is rather muted, and gives little indication that she would later develop into a major talent. Probably the best acting comes from the generally reliable Morgan Freeman as Paul Shannon, Eddie's old mentor who may have a sinister agenda, but "Chain Reaction" is not one of the really great Freeman films like "Glory", "Unforgiven" or "The Shawshank Redemption". The film does have some better qualities. The director Andrew Davis has been praised by his visual sense, and "Chain Reaction" is visually very attractive. The action takes place in winter and there is some striking photography of a wintry, snow-bound Chicago, especially the scenes set in the grim industrial districts and around the astronomical observatory which plays an important part in the plot. The action sequences are exciting, fast-moving and well handled. Davis has a reputation for specialising in thrillers. His films tend to vary in quality, but he has at least one very good one to his credit, "The Fugitive", one of the best thrillers of the nineties. (That film also dealt with a man forced to go on the run after being falsely accused of a crime). "Chain Reaction" is not in the same class as "The Fugitive", but it is a watchable thriller with some points of interest. 6/10

    When the scientist leading the search for a new low cost energy source announces that he intends to give the discovery to the world he is looked on as a bit of an idealist but when a breakthrough leads to the energy source's discovery things quickly go bad for his team; he is murdered and his lab totally destroyed; another of his team vanishes, presumed to have taken stolen data to China and another two; Eddie Kasalivich, the man who made the breakthrough and Dr. Lily Sinclair, a physicist on the team find themselves on the run having been framed for murder and selling the data. The only man they think they can trust is Eddie's mentor Paul Shannon but he is in no position as the FBI are watching him almost as keenly as they are watching Eddie and Lily. If they are to survive they will have to get out of Chicago and find a safe way to meet Shannon; all the time avoiding various law enforcement agencies and more dangerous characters working for the shadowy organisation that killed the scientist and destroyed his lab. While this is hardly a classic thriller it is a lot of fun; there are impressive explosions, numerous chases, shootings and a constant sense that our protagonists could be caught, or worse, at any moment. Keanu Reaves does a decent job as Eddie and Rachel Weiss is fine as Lily; however it is Morgan Freeman who dominates proceedings as Shannon; a man we aren't sure whether or not can be trusted for much of the film. Brian Cox also puts in a fun performance as the obvious villain Lyman Collier. The story itself is fairly silly but it is well told and there should be enough action and suspense to keep most viewers entertained well enough. I wouldn't say this is a must see film but it is worth watching if it is on television and there is nothing better on.

    Apart from being a great action flick Chain Reaction also has a plot that is quite intelligent and realistic. With the ever-increasing efforts of powers that be to control everything from information to technology, this movie offers us a plausible scenario with convincing actors, well and there's Keanu. Shot in a style of classic nineties action flicks it has wild chases, explosions and fire fights and pretty damsel in distress (Rachel Weisz). This is the genre in which Keanu Reaves is the best, and when we add Morgan Freeman to the equation we got the strength and charm combined with smarts. Not to mention stunning Rachel Weisz in one of her early roles, establishing herself as an action heroine. Although being an action flick Chain Reaction is one of those movies that relaxes, you can just let go of your worries and enjoy in an almost sci-fi atmosphere and interesting plot. Eddie Kasalivich is a part of a scientific team that is on a verge to discover the process that transforms water into fuel. Of course if this should happen, global economy and almost everything else would be instantly changed forever, so the stakes are quite high. After they succeeded in the experiment, things start to get ugly as one of the scientist is killed and Eddie and physicist Lily Sinclair are framed for the murder. With the machine stolen and them on the run from the authorities Eddie and Lily are in a quite a pickle. Soon they discover a conspiracy that involves some unlikely suspects. Will they manage to escape and clear their name while trying to tell the world about their discovery is up to you to find out

    Another good Keanu Reeves(as a machinist) thriller, and I must say the starcast is sexy! There's Rachel Weisz(a fellow scientist), Morgan Freeman(funds a secret science project), Brian Cox(as chairman of a secret research facility) and also Fred Ward(as FBI agent). I actually thought Chain Reaction would be a sci-fi thriller, but the sci-fi part isn't really there. We've only the beginning and the ending scene where some hydrogen reaction is shown. Rest of the movie is all about catch Keanu if you can! Rachel & he flees the cops, the FBI and some operatives intend on killing them while they try to expose the murky truth. Keanu, Rachel, Morgan and even Brian Cox are good. Also very good special effects, especially the massive explosion in the beginning which paves the way for the excitement that follows. Some of the disappointments included the ending bits. Keanu seems to easily find his way to a secret, heavily-guarded research facility, to not only rescue Rachel Weisz but also bring the entire kilometres-long facility crashing down to earth! That wasn't convincing. And also Rachel had a really weak role, as compared to Keanu or Morgan. Maybe that was the beginning phase of her career. Of course, it also bewilders me that Keanu also easily finds answers to fix the chemical reactions or even set it to explode if our bad guys don't turn back! I think I risk disliking the movie if I ask too many questions :p Verdict: Just leave your questions unanswered. You could like the movie & the suspense that way :-)

    Action Director Andy Davis should stay away from Films that have very deep Sociological implications and Heartfelt Left-Wing Idealism and stick to Movies that are "only" Entertainment. Because the Theme here is just too important and is a matter of Life and Death for the Planet. There are timely and difficult Problems to be solved and here the "fact" that water can be used as a cheap and effective means of Energy is most likely, in the near future, exactly what will be discovered. Its not that complicated at its base. Hydrogen is two parts in the water and it is highly Fissionable and is clean when burned.

It is not just the science upon which the film is based that is unclear; the plot too is often over-elaborate and difficult to fathom. We eventually learn that the real villains are agents of the Government and of Big Business, who are desperate to suppress Eddie's discovery because they fear that a new cheap, environmentally friendly source of energy would make oil obsolete, force all oil companies into bankruptcy and lead to economic depression and social chaos. In fact, capitalism is rather more adaptable than the screenwriters imagine; a new energy source of this nature, by dramatically reducing industry's energy costs, would more likely lead to an economic boom and huge profits for those companies who could exploit this lucrative new technology. Existing energy companies would probably be among them, just as many stagecoach owners made a fortune from the invention of the steam train by re-investing their money in railway shares. The only people with a vested interest in preventing such inventions reaching the market would be the governments of those countries which possess vast reservoirs of crude oil and very little else, but the film-makers doubtless thought that, in paranoid conspiracy-thrillers like this one, the United States Government makes a better villain than do foreign ones. Keanu Reeves's performance as Eddie is adequate but not outstanding. Rachel Weisz as Lily, in her first starring role in a Hollywood film, is rather muted, and gives little indication that she would later develop into a major talent. Probably the best acting comes from the generally reliable Morgan Freeman as Paul Shannon, Eddie's old mentor who may have a sinister agenda, but "Chain Reaction" is not one of the really great Freeman films like "Glory", "Unforgiven" or "The Shawshank Redemption". The film does have some better qualities. The director Andrew Davis has been praised by his visual sense, and "Chain Reaction" is visually very attractive. The action takes place in winter and there is some striking photography of a wintry, snow-bound Chicago, especially the scenes set in the grim industrial districts and around the astronomical observatory which plays an important part in the plot. The action sequences are exciting, fast-moving and well handled. Davis has a reputation for specialising in thrillers. His films tend to vary in quality, but he has at least one very good one to his credit, "The Fugitive", one of the best thrillers of the nineties. (That film also dealt with a man forced to go on the run after being falsely accused of a crime). "Chain Reaction" is not in the same class as "The Fugitive", but it is a watchable thriller with some points of interest. 6/10

    When the scientist leading the search for a new low cost energy source announces that he intends to give the discovery to the world he is looked on as a bit of an idealist but when a breakthrough leads to the energy source's discovery things quickly go bad for his team; he is murdered and his lab totally destroyed; another of his team vanishes, presumed to have taken stolen data to China and another two; Eddie Kasalivich, the man who made the breakthrough and Dr. Lily Sinclair, a physicist on the team find themselves on the run having been framed for murder and selling the data. The only man they think they can trust is Eddie's mentor Paul Shannon but he is in no position as the FBI are watching him almost as keenly as they are watching Eddie and Lily. If they are to survive they will have to get out of Chicago and find a safe way to meet Shannon; all the time avoiding various law enforcement agencies and more dangerous characters working for the shadowy organisation that killed the scientist and destroyed his lab. While this is hardly a classic thriller it is a lot of fun; there are impressive explosions, numerous chases, shootings and a constant sense that our protagonists could be caught, or worse, at any moment. Keanu Reaves does a decent job as Eddie and Rachel Weiss is fine as Lily; however it is Morgan Freeman who dominates proceedings as Shannon; a man we aren't sure whether or not can be trusted for much of the film. Brian Cox also puts in a fun performance as the obvious villain Lyman Collier. The story itself is fairly silly but it is well told and there should be enough action and suspense to keep most viewers entertained well enough. I wouldn't say this is a must see film but it is worth watching if it is on television and there is nothing better on.

    Apart from being a great action flick Chain Reaction also has a plot that is quite intelligent and realistic. With the ever-increasing efforts of powers that be to control everything from information to technology, this movie offers us a plausible scenario with convincing actors, well and there's Keanu. Shot in a style of classic nineties action flicks it has wild chases, explosions and fire fights and pretty damsel in distress (Rachel Weisz). This is the genre in which Keanu Reaves is the best, and when we add Morgan Freeman to the equation we got the strength and charm combined with smarts. Not to mention stunning Rachel Weisz in one of her early roles, establishing herself as an action heroine. Although being an action flick Chain Reaction is one of those movies that relaxes, you can just let go of your worries and enjoy in an almost sci-fi atmosphere and interesting plot. Eddie Kasalivich is a part of a scientific team that is on a verge to discover the process that transforms water into fuel. Of course if this should happen, global economy and almost everything else would be instantly changed forever, so the stakes are quite high. After they succeeded in the experiment, things start to get ugly as one of the scientist is killed and Eddie and physicist Lily Sinclair are framed for the murder. With the machine stolen and them on the run from the authorities Eddie and Lily are in a quite a pickle. Soon they discover a conspiracy that involves some unlikely suspects. Will they manage to escape and clear their name while trying to tell the world about their discovery is up to you to find out

    Another good Keanu Reeves(as a machinist) thriller, and I must say the starcast is sexy! There's Rachel Weisz(a fellow scientist), Morgan Freeman(funds a secret science project), Brian Cox(as chairman of a secret research facility) and also Fred Ward(as FBI agent). I actually thought Chain Reaction would be a sci-fi thriller, but the sci-fi part isn't really there. We've only the beginning and the ending scene where some hydrogen reaction is shown. Rest of the movie is all about catch Keanu if you can! Rachel & he flees the cops, the FBI and some operatives intend on killing them while they try to expose the murky truth. Keanu, Rachel, Morgan and even Brian Cox are good. Also very good special effects, especially the massive explosion in the beginning which paves the way for the excitement that follows. Some of the disappointments included the ending bits. Keanu seems to easily find his way to a secret, heavily-guarded research facility, to not only rescue Rachel Weisz but also bring the entire kilometres-long facility crashing down to earth! That wasn't convincing. And also Rachel had a really weak role, as compared to Keanu or Morgan. Maybe that was the beginning phase of her career. Of course, it also bewilders me that Keanu also easily finds answers to fix the chemical reactions or even set it to explode if our bad guys don't turn back! I think I risk disliking the movie if I ask too many questions :p Verdict: Just leave your questions unanswered. You could like the movie & the suspense that way :-)

    Action Director Andy Davis should stay away from Films that have very deep Sociological implications and Heartfelt Left-Wing Idealism and stick to Movies that are "only" Entertainment. Because the Theme here is just too important and is a matter of Life and Death for the Planet. There are timely and difficult Problems to be solved and here the "fact" that water can be used as a cheap and effective means of Energy is most likely, in the near future, exactly what will be discovered. Its not that complicated at its base. Hydrogen is two parts in the water and it is highly Fissionable and is clean when burned. So look for it coming soon, if they let it, but if the Greed and Control in History is any indication, don't sell your Oil Stocks. But here it is nothing more than the substantial backdrop to the Story and is drained of it Power and used almost as a McGuffin. There is also the disturbing and inevitable Truth that if a source of Free Energy is discovered, the Power Elite will suppress it and destroy anything or anybody who would stop them from keeping it for themselves. It is dangerous being Green. The Movie utilizes these two profound Truths, one undeniable (Suppression) and the other almost a certainty (Clean Free Energy), but the whole thing feels like it is running on Empty. But as an Action Movie it is pretty good and is Entertaining and a lot of fun. But that painful Back Story is just too sensitive to be relegated to just another forgettable Popcorn Romp.

    I found reviews for this film on IMDb confusing and wondered whether people had watched the same film as me. One reviewer said that the film doesn't mention sonoluminescence (it does, explicitly), others say that certain things aren't explained ie the explosion in the warehouse. Well d'uh! Hydrogen is not an inert gas and is highly flammable (mentioned a LOT in the film) and people complain about lack of plot then demonstrate they didn't understand it anyway! Chain Reaction is a science-heavy sci-fi chase film where two people who barely know each other are framed for something they didn't do and go on the run. Suspension of "why didn't they just go to the FBI and explain" aside, it's a ripping good fairly intelligent yarn which isn't dumbed down so it's not all spelled out, especially Shannon's character (Morgan Freeman) who throughout is ambiguous in who's side he is actually on. Aspects of the story are insidious - an environmentally friendly fuel that would revolutionise the world and a Government Agency wants to suppress it and an idealist is labelled a dreamer for wanting to make a difference. It's isn't too hard to believe that is a possible scenario. Okay some of the acting is a little cheesy but overall the performances were perfectly fine. Freeman of course is superior. Dr Alistair Barkley (Nicholas Rudall) was also a lovely actor and character, although not well known, and his monologue at the beginning is just superb and emotive - clearly the writing/screenplay was very good except for the repetition of everyone's names during conversation, that really gets on my nerves. The plot is as simple or as complex as you want. On the surface it's a simple on the run film, but the political conspiracy aspects and science-stuff make it a deeper story, which not being spelled out adds to the mystery. Reeves of course is excellent at the action, and plays resourceful convincingly and easily; I liked his dogged determination to rescue Lily and clear their names. Rachel Weisz's Physicist the "too serious Lily" is a bit weak, a bit of a drag on the survival given that everything is done for her but perhaps that is more realistic, women don't miraculously turn into gung-ho running leaping shooting and fighting survivalists, but I do expect her to do something but her emotions are very real especially regarding Chen (Tzi Ma). Whilst you see a potential romance on the cards for Eddie and Lily it's nice that the screenplay doesn't dwell on it, and the focus of the plot given the lack of time and Eddie Kasalivich being a gentleman. The SFX in the film are good, especially the explosions, and I'm betting Reeves does his own bike stunts. There are many stunts which are pretty good but they are within the bounds of realism - and this is generally why the characters are relatable and convincing. It's got a tense crescendo to how it runs out, and it's entertaining and adult without resorting to bad language and gratuitous violence - I would consider it almost a family film (older family). I'm not saying it's the best film every made, but I like all aspects of it to have seen it a number of times. I think some people try and read too much into the science, it's not supposed to be an episode of the Open University, it's just a science-fiction that isn't too far from feasible possibility. Just sit back and enjoy for some entertainment.

    Keanu Reeves, Morgan Freeman, and Rachel Weisz are involved in a "Chain Reaction" in this 1996 film, directed by Andrew Davis, who also directed "The Fugitive." There are some plot similarities, but then, there are also plot similarities to many other films. Reeves plays Eddie, a young man who is part of a team working toward clean, free energy, - obviously, a highly-prized entity by many people. On the night their work actually pays off, and their experiment is a success, the team has a huge party. Later, an unknown faction basically destroys the building, wiping out eight city blocks. Eddie, who was returning to the building to pick up his motorcycle after seeing the tipsy Lily (Weisz) home, ends up being framed and goes on the run with Lily. Everyone is after them, especially after a police officer is killed, for which Eddie is blamed. This film had fantastic effects, imaginative stunts, and decent performances, with Rachel Weisz being wasted in an extraneous role. Freeman's character is deliberately ambiguous, and he does a good job at keeping us guessing. Handsome Keanu Reeves, not really a great actor, is nevertheless not a bad actor either, so he is able to hold his own. I don't mind a film being derivative, but my basic problem with this one occurs at the beginning. For me there just wasn't enough set-up. I understand that producers today want all the action to start a few minutes into the film, but there was not enough development in the beginning to attach us to this massive project and the people working on it. An extra five minutes would have been fine. Entertaining, a good rental.

    I'm a big Keanu Reeves fan but I won't be watching this film again in a hurry. This is one of those films where you ask why did they bother doing a Blu-ray release? This is primarily a chase film and there are several cinematic scenes that would be worth it if they were only shot at a wider angle. The soundtrack is a horrible, bargain basement, clich&eacute; score with no tracks to invigorate the film. What this film really lacks is a Tommy Lee Jones level character to do the chasing like in "The Fugitive" and "U.S. Marshals". Instead we are left with a mixture a baddies and cops with a 90's made-for-TV feel to them. This is somewhat surprising as director Andrew Davis helmed "The Fugitive" This film is notable as being Rachel Weisz's breakthrough role but the film sadly lacks the talent, humour and charisma evident in her subsequent roles. Most notably of these is where she teams up with Keanu again for one of my all time favourite films: "Constantine". The science fiction element of this film is negligible and will disappoint sci-fi fans. I would recommend rather watching "Johnny Mnemonic" or "The Matrix". However the concept of the story is very relevant. A new power source like Cold Fusion would be a major economic and political game changer. The constant chase scenes distract from the underlying government conspiracy story, which could easily have been better fleshed out to give us a film more on the level of "Sneakers". There is a good storyline to this film. Unfortunately the elements of the production let film down despite the presence of Keanu Reeves and Morgan Freeman.

    Simply put, one of my favorite movies of the 90s, because I'm a big fan of the Fugitive. This plot follows it adds a bit of a new age spin on it. Enjoyable flick with very good actors and a cast that features Keanu Reeves, Morgan Freeman, Fred Ward, Brian Cox, Rachel Weisz and many others, highly recommended if you're a fan of the Fugitive or U.S. Marshalls! The story is about a chemist & his friend suspected of murdering their mentor and Reeves & Weisz receive help from a friend of their fallen colleague and they try and find out who is trying to frame them for murder. Much like The Fugitive, which ironically is done by most of the same crew and features some of the actors from that film, it's a great flick to pass the time on.

    Just watched the big budget CHAIN REACTION on the Reelz channel, and it all made for a very underwhelming Sat. night. Some sort of convoluted plot about alternative fuel which didn't make a whole bunch of sense was the back drop to Keanu Reeves & Rachel Weisz running everywhere around Chicago and So. Wisconsin in January of 1996. It certainly was fun picking out Chicago bit actors of the era, including Chelcie Ross, a very young and skinny Michael Shannon (or as I know him now, Nelson Van Alden from "Boardwalk Empire"), John Cusack's late father, and even a couple of CBS2 Chicago veteran investigative reporters, Pam Zekman and John Drummond. The best parts were the location shots at Williams Bay on frozen Lake Geneva Wisc., including the inside of the Yerkes Observatory and Keanu spinning around on an "everglades like" hovercraft just missing some 'Sconnie fish houses. But all in all, I'd say take a pass on CHAIN REACTION unless nothing else is on.

    Eddie Kasalivich is a student machinist working on a project at the University of Chicago to obtain energy from water, when he discovers the secret of a process by which low-cost energy can be obtained from burning hydrogen, leaving only water as a residue. (The exact science is not always clear, but this appears to be some sort of nuclear fusion). Someone, however, obviously wants to sabotage Eddie's discovery, and one of his colleagues is murdered and the laboratory is destroyed in a massive explosion. Eddie and another colleague, Dr. Lily Sinclair, are questioned by the police and the FBI, and quickly realise that someone is trying to frame them for both the murder and the explosion. They are forced to go on the run to try and clear their names and to expose the true culprits. It is not just the science upon which the film is based that is unclear; the plot too is often over-elaborate and difficult to fathom. We eventually learn that the real villains are agents of the Government and of Big Business, who are desperate to suppress Eddie's discovery because they fear that a new cheap, environmentally friendly source of energy would make oil obsolete, force all oil companies into bankruptcy and lead to economic depression and social chaos. In fact, capitalism is rather more adaptable than the screenwriters imagine; a new energy source of this nature, by dramatically reducing industry's energy costs, would more likely lead to an economic boom and huge profits for those companies who could exploit this lucrative new technology.

Rachel Weisz's Physicist the "too serious Lily" is a bit weak, a bit of a drag on the survival given that everything is done for her but perhaps that is more realistic, women don't miraculously turn into gung-ho running leaping shooting and fighting survivalists, but I do expect her to do something but her emotions are very real especially regarding Chen (Tzi Ma). Whilst you see a potential romance on the cards for Eddie and Lily it's nice that the screenplay doesn't dwell on it, and the focus of the plot given the lack of time and Eddie Kasalivich being a gentleman. The SFX in the film are good, especially the explosions, and I'm betting Reeves does his own bike stunts. There are many stunts which are pretty good but they are within the bounds of realism - and this is generally why the characters are relatable and convincing. It's got a tense crescendo to how it runs out, and it's entertaining and adult without resorting to bad language and gratuitous violence - I would consider it almost a family film (older family). I'm not saying it's the best film every made, but I like all aspects of it to have seen it a number of times. I think some people try and read too much into the science, it's not supposed to be an episode of the Open University, it's just a science-fiction that isn't too far from feasible possibility. Just sit back and enjoy for some entertainment.

    Keanu Reeves, Morgan Freeman, and Rachel Weisz are involved in a "Chain Reaction" in this 1996 film, directed by Andrew Davis, who also directed "The Fugitive." There are some plot similarities, but then, there are also plot similarities to many other films. Reeves plays Eddie, a young man who is part of a team working toward clean, free energy, - obviously, a highly-prized entity by many people. On the night their work actually pays off, and their experiment is a success, the team has a huge party. Later, an unknown faction basically destroys the building, wiping out eight city blocks. Eddie, who was returning to the building to pick up his motorcycle after seeing the tipsy Lily (Weisz) home, ends up being framed and goes on the run with Lily. Everyone is after them, especially after a police officer is killed, for which Eddie is blamed. This film had fantastic effects, imaginative stunts, and decent performances, with Rachel Weisz being wasted in an extraneous role. Freeman's character is deliberately ambiguous, and he does a good job at keeping us guessing. Handsome Keanu Reeves, not really a great actor, is nevertheless not a bad actor either, so he is able to hold his own. I don't mind a film being derivative, but my basic problem with this one occurs at the beginning. For me there just wasn't enough set-up. I understand that producers today want all the action to start a few minutes into the film, but there was not enough development in the beginning to attach us to this massive project and the people working on it. An extra five minutes would have been fine. Entertaining, a good rental.

    I'm a big Keanu Reeves fan but I won't be watching this film again in a hurry. This is one of those films where you ask why did they bother doing a Blu-ray release? This is primarily a chase film and there are several cinematic scenes that would be worth it if they were only shot at a wider angle. The soundtrack is a horrible, bargain basement, clich&eacute; score with no tracks to invigorate the film. What this film really lacks is a Tommy Lee Jones level character to do the chasing like in "The Fugitive" and "U.S. Marshals". Instead we are left with a mixture a baddies and cops with a 90's made-for-TV feel to them. This is somewhat surprising as director Andrew Davis helmed "The Fugitive" This film is notable as being Rachel Weisz's breakthrough role but the film sadly lacks the talent, humour and charisma evident in her subsequent roles. Most notably of these is where she teams up with Keanu again for one of my all time favourite films: "Constantine". The science fiction element of this film is negligible and will disappoint sci-fi fans. I would recommend rather watching "Johnny Mnemonic" or "The Matrix". However the concept of the story is very relevant. A new power source like Cold Fusion would be a major economic and political game changer. The constant chase scenes distract from the underlying government conspiracy story, which could easily have been better fleshed out to give us a film more on the level of "Sneakers". There is a good storyline to this film. Unfortunately the elements of the production let film down despite the presence of Keanu Reeves and Morgan Freeman.

    Simply put, one of my favorite movies of the 90s, because I'm a big fan of the Fugitive. This plot follows it adds a bit of a new age spin on it. Enjoyable flick with very good actors and a cast that features Keanu Reeves, Morgan Freeman, Fred Ward, Brian Cox, Rachel Weisz and many others, highly recommended if you're a fan of the Fugitive or U.S. Marshalls! The story is about a chemist & his friend suspected of murdering their mentor and Reeves & Weisz receive help from a friend of their fallen colleague and they try and find out who is trying to frame them for murder. Much like The Fugitive, which ironically is done by most of the same crew and features some of the actors from that film, it's a great flick to pass the time on.

    Just watched the big budget CHAIN REACTION on the Reelz channel, and it all made for a very underwhelming Sat. night. Some sort of convoluted plot about alternative fuel which didn't make a whole bunch of sense was the back drop to Keanu Reeves & Rachel Weisz running everywhere around Chicago and So. Wisconsin in January of 1996. It certainly was fun picking out Chicago bit actors of the era, including Chelcie Ross, a very young and skinny Michael Shannon (or as I know him now, Nelson Van Alden from "Boardwalk Empire"), John Cusack's late father, and even a couple of CBS2 Chicago veteran investigative reporters, Pam Zekman and John Drummond. The best parts were the location shots at Williams Bay on frozen Lake Geneva Wisc., including the inside of the Yerkes Observatory and Keanu spinning around on an "everglades like" hovercraft just missing some 'Sconnie fish houses. But all in all, I'd say take a pass on CHAIN REACTION unless nothing else is on.

    Eddie Kasalivich is a student machinist working on a project at the University of Chicago to obtain energy from water, when he discovers the secret of a process by which low-cost energy can be obtained from burning hydrogen, leaving only water as a residue. (The exact science is not always clear, but this appears to be some sort of nuclear fusion). Someone, however, obviously wants to sabotage Eddie's discovery, and one of his colleagues is murdered and the laboratory is destroyed in a massive explosion. Eddie and another colleague, Dr. Lily Sinclair, are questioned by the police and the FBI, and quickly realise that someone is trying to frame them for both the murder and the explosion. They are forced to go on the run to try and clear their names and to expose the true culprits. It is not just the science upon which the film is based that is unclear; the plot too is often over-elaborate and difficult to fathom. We eventually learn that the real villains are agents of the Government and of Big Business, who are desperate to suppress Eddie's discovery because they fear that a new cheap, environmentally friendly source of energy would make oil obsolete, force all oil companies into bankruptcy and lead to economic depression and social chaos. In fact, capitalism is rather more adaptable than the screenwriters imagine; a new energy source of this nature, by dramatically reducing industry's energy costs, would more likely lead to an economic boom and huge profits for those companies who could exploit this lucrative new technology. Existing energy companies would probably be among them, just as many stagecoach owners made a fortune from the invention of the steam train by re-investing their money in railway shares. The only people with a vested interest in preventing such inventions reaching the market would be the governments of those countries which possess vast reservoirs of crude oil and very little else, but the film-makers doubtless thought that, in paranoid conspiracy-thrillers like this one, the United States Government makes a better villain than do foreign ones. Keanu Reeves's performance as Eddie is adequate but not outstanding. Rachel Weisz as Lily, in her first starring role in a Hollywood film, is rather muted, and gives little indication that she would later develop into a major talent. Probably the best acting comes from the generally reliable Morgan Freeman as Paul Shannon, Eddie's old mentor who may have a sinister agenda, but "Chain Reaction" is not one of the really great Freeman films like "Glory", "Unforgiven" or "The Shawshank Redemption". The film does have some better qualities. The director Andrew Davis has been praised by his visual sense, and "Chain Reaction" is visually very attractive. The action takes place in winter and there is some striking photography of a wintry, snow-bound Chicago, especially the scenes set in the grim industrial districts and around the astronomical observatory which plays an important part in the plot. The action sequences are exciting, fast-moving and well handled. Davis has a reputation for specialising in thrillers. His films tend to vary in quality, but he has at least one very good one to his credit, "The Fugitive", one of the best thrillers of the nineties. (That film also dealt with a man forced to go on the run after being falsely accused of a crime). "Chain Reaction" is not in the same class as "The Fugitive", but it is a watchable thriller with some points of interest. 6/10

    When the scientist leading the search for a new low cost energy source announces that he intends to give the discovery to the world he is looked on as a bit of an idealist but when a breakthrough leads to the energy source's discovery things quickly go bad for his team; he is murdered and his lab totally destroyed; another of his team vanishes, presumed to have taken stolen data to China and another two; Eddie Kasalivich, the man who made the breakthrough and Dr. Lily Sinclair, a physicist on the team find themselves on the run having been framed for murder and selling the data. The only man they think they can trust is Eddie's mentor Paul Shannon but he is in no position as the FBI are watching him almost as keenly as they are watching Eddie and Lily. If they are to survive they will have to get out of Chicago and find a safe way to meet Shannon; all the time avoiding various law enforcement agencies and more dangerous characters working for the shadowy organisation that killed the scientist and destroyed his lab. While this is hardly a classic thriller it is a lot of fun; there are impressive explosions, numerous chases, shootings and a constant sense that our protagonists could be caught, or worse, at any moment. Keanu Reaves does a decent job as Eddie and Rachel Weiss is fine as Lily; however it is Morgan Freeman who dominates proceedings as Shannon; a man we aren't sure whether or not can be trusted for much of the film. Brian Cox also puts in a fun performance as the obvious villain Lyman Collier. The story itself is fairly silly but it is well told and there should be enough action and suspense to keep most viewers entertained well enough. I wouldn't say this is a must see film but it is worth watching if it is on television and there is nothing better on.

    Apart from being a great action flick Chain Reaction also has a plot that is quite intelligent and realistic. With the ever-increasing efforts of powers that be to control everything from information to technology, this movie offers us a plausible scenario with convincing actors, well and there's Keanu. Shot in a style of classic nineties action flicks it has wild chases, explosions and fire fights and pretty damsel in distress (Rachel Weisz). This is the genre in which Keanu Reaves is the best, and when we add Morgan Freeman to the equation we got the strength and charm combined with smarts. Not to mention stunning Rachel Weisz in one of her early roles, establishing herself as an action heroine. Although being an action flick Chain Reaction is one of those movies that relaxes, you can just let go of your worries and enjoy in an almost sci-fi atmosphere and interesting plot. Eddie Kasalivich is a part of a scientific team that is on a verge to discover the process that transforms water into fuel. Of course if this should happen, global economy and almost everything else would be instantly changed forever, so the stakes are quite high. After they succeeded in the experiment, things start to get ugly as one of the scientist is killed and Eddie and physicist Lily Sinclair are framed for the murder. With the machine stolen and them on the run from the authorities Eddie and Lily are in a quite a pickle. Soon they discover a conspiracy that involves some unlikely suspects. Will they manage to escape and clear their name while trying to tell the world about their discovery is up to you to find out

    Another good Keanu Reeves(as a machinist) thriller, and I must say the starcast is sexy! There's Rachel Weisz(a fellow scientist), Morgan Freeman(funds a secret science project), Brian Cox(as chairman of a secret research facility) and also Fred Ward(as FBI agent). I actually thought Chain Reaction would be a sci-fi thriller, but the sci-fi part isn't really there. We've only the beginning and the ending scene where some hydrogen reaction is shown. Rest of the movie is all about catch Keanu if you can! Rachel & he flees the cops, the FBI and some operatives intend on killing them while they try to expose the murky truth. Keanu, Rachel, Morgan and even Brian Cox are good. Also very good special effects, especially the massive explosion in the beginning which paves the way for the excitement that follows. Some of the disappointments included the ending bits. Keanu seems to easily find his way to a secret, heavily-guarded research facility, to not only rescue Rachel Weisz but also bring the entire kilometres-long facility crashing down to earth! That wasn't convincing. And also Rachel had a really weak role, as compared to Keanu or Morgan. Maybe that was the beginning phase of her career. Of course, it also bewilders me that Keanu also easily finds answers to fix the chemical reactions or even set it to explode if our bad guys don't turn back! I think I risk disliking the movie if I ask too many questions :p Verdict: Just leave your questions unanswered. You could like the movie & the suspense that way :-)

    Action Director Andy Davis should stay away from Films that have very deep Sociological implications and Heartfelt Left-Wing Idealism and stick to Movies that are "only" Entertainment. Because the Theme here is just too important and is a matter of Life and Death for the Planet. There are timely and difficult Problems to be solved and here the "fact" that water can be used as a cheap and effective means of Energy is most likely, in the near future, exactly what will be discovered. Its not that complicated at its base. Hydrogen is two parts in the water and it is highly Fissionable and is clean when burned. So look for it coming soon, if they let it, but if the Greed and Control in History is any indication, don't sell your Oil Stocks. But here it is nothing more than the substantial backdrop to the Story and is drained of it Power and used almost as a McGuffin. There is also the disturbing and inevitable Truth that if a source of Free Energy is discovered, the Power Elite will suppress it and destroy anything or anybody who would stop them from keeping it for themselves. It is dangerous being Green. The Movie utilizes these two profound Truths, one undeniable (Suppression) and the other almost a certainty (Clean Free Energy), but the whole thing feels like it is running on Empty. But as an Action Movie it is pretty good and is Entertaining and a lot of fun. But that painful Back Story is just too sensitive to be relegated to just another forgettable Popcorn Romp.

    I found reviews for this film on IMDb confusing and wondered whether people had watched the same film as me. One reviewer said that the film doesn't mention sonoluminescence (it does, explicitly), others say that certain things aren't explained ie the explosion in the warehouse. Well d'uh! Hydrogen is not an inert gas and is highly flammable (mentioned a LOT in the film) and people complain about lack of plot then demonstrate they didn't understand it anyway! Chain Reaction is a science-heavy sci-fi chase film where two people who barely know each other are framed for something they didn't do and go on the run. Suspension of "why didn't they just go to the FBI and explain" aside, it's a ripping good fairly intelligent yarn which isn't dumbed down so it's not all spelled out, especially Shannon's character (Morgan Freeman) who throughout is ambiguous in who's side he is actually on. Aspects of the story are insidious - an environmentally friendly fuel that would revolutionise the world and a Government Agency wants to suppress it and an idealist is labelled a dreamer for wanting to make a difference. It's isn't too hard to believe that is a possible scenario. Okay some of the acting is a little cheesy but overall the performances were perfectly fine. Freeman of course is superior. Dr Alistair Barkley (Nicholas Rudall) was also a lovely actor and character, although not well known, and his monologue at the beginning is just superb and emotive - clearly the writing/screenplay was very good except for the repetition of everyone's names during conversation, that really gets on my nerves. The plot is as simple or as complex as you want. On the surface it's a simple on the run film, but the political conspiracy aspects and science-stuff make it a deeper story, which not being spelled out adds to the mystery. Reeves of course is excellent at the action, and plays resourceful convincingly and easily; I liked his dogged determination to rescue Lily and clear their names. Rachel Weisz's Physicist the "too serious Lily" is a bit weak, a bit of a drag on the survival given that everything is done for her but perhaps that is more realistic, women don't miraculously turn into gung-ho running leaping shooting and fighting survivalists, but I do expect her to do something but her emotions are very real especially regarding Chen (Tzi Ma). Whilst you see a potential romance on the cards for Eddie and Lily it's nice that the screenplay doesn't dwell on it, and the focus of the plot given the lack of time and Eddie Kasalivich being a gentleman. The SFX in the film are good, especially the explosions, and I'm betting Reeves does his own bike stunts.

I'm not saying it's the best film every made, but I like all aspects of it to have seen it a number of times. I think some people try and read too much into the science, it's not supposed to be an episode of the Open University, it's just a science-fiction that isn't too far from feasible possibility. Just sit back and enjoy for some entertainment.

    When the scientist leading the search for a new low cost energy source announces that he intends to give the discovery to the world he is looked on as a bit of an idealist but when a breakthrough leads to the energy source's discovery things quickly go bad for his team; he is murdered and his lab totally destroyed; another of his team vanishes, presumed to have taken stolen data to China and another two; Eddie Kasalivich, the man who made the breakthrough and Dr. Lily Sinclair, a physicist on the team find themselves on the run having been framed for murder and selling the data. The only man they think they can trust is Eddie's mentor Paul Shannon but he is in no position as the FBI are watching him almost as keenly as they are watching Eddie and Lily. If they are to survive they will have to get out of Chicago and find a safe way to meet Shannon; all the time avoiding various law enforcement agencies and more dangerous characters working for the shadowy organisation that killed the scientist and destroyed his lab. While this is hardly a classic thriller it is a lot of fun; there are impressive explosions, numerous chases, shootings and a constant sense that our protagonists could be caught, or worse, at any moment. Keanu Reaves does a decent job as Eddie and Rachel Weiss is fine as Lily; however it is Morgan Freeman who dominates proceedings as Shannon; a man we aren't sure whether or not can be trusted for much of the film. Brian Cox also puts in a fun performance as the obvious villain Lyman Collier. The story itself is fairly silly but it is well told and there should be enough action and suspense to keep most viewers entertained well enough. I wouldn't say this is a must see film but it is worth watching if it is on television and there is nothing better on.

    Apart from being a great action flick Chain Reaction also has a plot that is quite intelligent and realistic. With the ever-increasing efforts of powers that be to control everything from information to technology, this movie offers us a plausible scenario with convincing actors, well and there's Keanu. Shot in a style of classic nineties action flicks it has wild chases, explosions and fire fights and pretty damsel in distress (Rachel Weisz). This is the genre in which Keanu Reaves is the best, and when we add Morgan Freeman to the equation we got the strength and charm combined with smarts. Not to mention stunning Rachel Weisz in one of her early roles, establishing herself as an action heroine. Although being an action flick Chain Reaction is one of those movies that relaxes, you can just let go of your worries and enjoy in an almost sci-fi atmosphere and interesting plot. Eddie Kasalivich is a part of a scientific team that is on a verge to discover the process that transforms water into fuel. Of course if this should happen, global economy and almost everything else would be instantly changed forever, so the stakes are quite high. After they succeeded in the experiment, things start to get ugly as one of the scientist is killed and Eddie and physicist Lily Sinclair are framed for the murder. With the machine stolen and them on the run from the authorities Eddie and Lily are in a quite a pickle. Soon they discover a conspiracy that involves some unlikely suspects. Will they manage to escape and clear their name while trying to tell the world about their discovery is up to you to find out

    Another good Keanu Reeves(as a machinist) thriller, and I must say the starcast is sexy! There's Rachel Weisz(a fellow scientist), Morgan Freeman(funds a secret science project), Brian Cox(as chairman of a secret research facility) and also Fred Ward(as FBI agent). I actually thought Chain Reaction would be a sci-fi thriller, but the sci-fi part isn't really there. We've only the beginning and the ending scene where some hydrogen reaction is shown. Rest of the movie is all about catch Keanu if you can! Rachel & he flees the cops, the FBI and some operatives intend on killing them while they try to expose the murky truth. Keanu, Rachel, Morgan and even Brian Cox are good. Also very good special effects, especially the massive explosion in the beginning which paves the way for the excitement that follows. Some of the disappointments included the ending bits. Keanu seems to easily find his way to a secret, heavily-guarded research facility, to not only rescue Rachel Weisz but also bring the entire kilometres-long facility crashing down to earth! That wasn't convincing. And also Rachel had a really weak role, as compared to Keanu or Morgan. Maybe that was the beginning phase of her career. Of course, it also bewilders me that Keanu also easily finds answers to fix the chemical reactions or even set it to explode if our bad guys don't turn back! I think I risk disliking the movie if I ask too many questions :p Verdict: Just leave your questions unanswered. You could like the movie & the suspense that way :-)

    Action Director Andy Davis should stay away from Films that have very deep Sociological implications and Heartfelt Left-Wing Idealism and stick to Movies that are "only" Entertainment. Because the Theme here is just too important and is a matter of Life and Death for the Planet. There are timely and difficult Problems to be solved and here the "fact" that water can be used as a cheap and effective means of Energy is most likely, in the near future, exactly what will be discovered. Its not that complicated at its base. Hydrogen is two parts in the water and it is highly Fissionable and is clean when burned. So look for it coming soon, if they let it, but if the Greed and Control in History is any indication, don't sell your Oil Stocks. But here it is nothing more than the substantial backdrop to the Story and is drained of it Power and used almost as a McGuffin. There is also the disturbing and inevitable Truth that if a source of Free Energy is discovered, the Power Elite will suppress it and destroy anything or anybody who would stop them from keeping it for themselves. It is dangerous being Green. The Movie utilizes these two profound Truths, one undeniable (Suppression) and the other almost a certainty (Clean Free Energy), but the whole thing feels like it is running on Empty. But as an Action Movie it is pretty good and is Entertaining and a lot of fun. But that painful Back Story is just too sensitive to be relegated to just another forgettable Popcorn Romp.

    I found reviews for this film on IMDb confusing and wondered whether people had watched the same film as me. One reviewer said that the film doesn't mention sonoluminescence (it does, explicitly), others say that certain things aren't explained ie the explosion in the warehouse. Well d'uh! Hydrogen is not an inert gas and is highly flammable (mentioned a LOT in the film) and people complain about lack of plot then demonstrate they didn't understand it anyway! Chain Reaction is a science-heavy sci-fi chase film where two people who barely know each other are framed for something they didn't do and go on the run. Suspension of "why didn't they just go to the FBI and explain" aside, it's a ripping good fairly intelligent yarn which isn't dumbed down so it's not all spelled out, especially Shannon's character (Morgan Freeman) who throughout is ambiguous in who's side he is actually on. Aspects of the story are insidious - an environmentally friendly fuel that would revolutionise the world and a Government Agency wants to suppress it and an idealist is labelled a dreamer for wanting to make a difference. It's isn't too hard to believe that is a possible scenario. Okay some of the acting is a little cheesy but overall the performances were perfectly fine. Freeman of course is superior. Dr Alistair Barkley (Nicholas Rudall) was also a lovely actor and character, although not well known, and his monologue at the beginning is just superb and emotive - clearly the writing/screenplay was very good except for the repetition of everyone's names during conversation, that really gets on my nerves. The plot is as simple or as complex as you want. On the surface it's a simple on the run film, but the political conspiracy aspects and science-stuff make it a deeper story, which not being spelled out adds to the mystery. Reeves of course is excellent at the action, and plays resourceful convincingly and easily; I liked his dogged determination to rescue Lily and clear their names. Rachel Weisz's Physicist the "too serious Lily" is a bit weak, a bit of a drag on the survival given that everything is done for her but perhaps that is more realistic, women don't miraculously turn into gung-ho running leaping shooting and fighting survivalists, but I do expect her to do something but her emotions are very real especially regarding Chen (Tzi Ma). Whilst you see a potential romance on the cards for Eddie and Lily it's nice that the screenplay doesn't dwell on it, and the focus of the plot given the lack of time and Eddie Kasalivich being a gentleman. The SFX in the film are good, especially the explosions, and I'm betting Reeves does his own bike stunts. There are many stunts which are pretty good but they are within the bounds of realism - and this is generally why the characters are relatable and convincing. It's got a tense crescendo to how it runs out, and it's entertaining and adult without resorting to bad language and gratuitous violence - I would consider it almost a family film (older family). I'm not saying it's the best film every made, but I like all aspects of it to have seen it a number of times. I think some people try and read too much into the science, it's not supposed to be an episode of the Open University, it's just a science-fiction that isn't too far from feasible possibility. Just sit back and enjoy for some entertainment.

    Keanu Reeves, Morgan Freeman, and Rachel Weisz are involved in a "Chain Reaction" in this 1996 film, directed by Andrew Davis, who also directed "The Fugitive." There are some plot similarities, but then, there are also plot similarities to many other films. Reeves plays Eddie, a young man who is part of a team working toward clean, free energy, - obviously, a highly-prized entity by many people. On the night their work actually pays off, and their experiment is a success, the team has a huge party. Later, an unknown faction basically destroys the building, wiping out eight city blocks. Eddie, who was returning to the building to pick up his motorcycle after seeing the tipsy Lily (Weisz) home, ends up being framed and goes on the run with Lily. Everyone is after them, especially after a police officer is killed, for which Eddie is blamed. This film had fantastic effects, imaginative stunts, and decent performances, with Rachel Weisz being wasted in an extraneous role. Freeman's character is deliberately ambiguous, and he does a good job at keeping us guessing. Handsome Keanu Reeves, not really a great actor, is nevertheless not a bad actor either, so he is able to hold his own. I don't mind a film being derivative, but my basic problem with this one occurs at the beginning. For me there just wasn't enough set-up. I understand that producers today want all the action to start a few minutes into the film, but there was not enough development in the beginning to attach us to this massive project and the people working on it. An extra five minutes would have been fine. Entertaining, a good rental.

    I'm a big Keanu Reeves fan but I won't be watching this film again in a hurry. This is one of those films where you ask why did they bother doing a Blu-ray release? This is primarily a chase film and there are several cinematic scenes that would be worth it if they were only shot at a wider angle. The soundtrack is a horrible, bargain basement, clich&eacute; score with no tracks to invigorate the film. What this film really lacks is a Tommy Lee Jones level character to do the chasing like in "The Fugitive" and "U.S. Marshals". Instead we are left with a mixture a baddies and cops with a 90's made-for-TV feel to them. This is somewhat surprising as director Andrew Davis helmed "The Fugitive" This film is notable as being Rachel Weisz's breakthrough role but the film sadly lacks the talent, humour and charisma evident in her subsequent roles. Most notably of these is where she teams up with Keanu again for one of my all time favourite films: "Constantine". The science fiction element of this film is negligible and will disappoint sci-fi fans. I would recommend rather watching "Johnny Mnemonic" or "The Matrix". However the concept of the story is very relevant. A new power source like Cold Fusion would be a major economic and political game changer. The constant chase scenes distract from the underlying government conspiracy story, which could easily have been better fleshed out to give us a film more on the level of "Sneakers". There is a good storyline to this film. Unfortunately the elements of the production let film down despite the presence of Keanu Reeves and Morgan Freeman.

    Simply put, one of my favorite movies of the 90s, because I'm a big fan of the Fugitive. This plot follows it adds a bit of a new age spin on it. Enjoyable flick with very good actors and a cast that features Keanu Reeves, Morgan Freeman, Fred Ward, Brian Cox, Rachel Weisz and many others, highly recommended if you're a fan of the Fugitive or U.S. Marshalls! The story is about a chemist & his friend suspected of murdering their mentor and Reeves & Weisz receive help from a friend of their fallen colleague and they try and find out who is trying to frame them for murder. Much like The Fugitive, which ironically is done by most of the same crew and features some of the actors from that film, it's a great flick to pass the time on.

    Just watched the big budget CHAIN REACTION on the Reelz channel, and it all made for a very underwhelming Sat. night. Some sort of convoluted plot about alternative fuel which didn't make a whole bunch of sense was the back drop to Keanu Reeves & Rachel Weisz running everywhere around Chicago and So. Wisconsin in January of 1996. It certainly was fun picking out Chicago bit actors of the era, including Chelcie Ross, a very young and skinny Michael Shannon (or as I know him now, Nelson Van Alden from "Boardwalk Empire"), John Cusack's late father, and even a couple of CBS2 Chicago veteran investigative reporters, Pam Zekman and John Drummond. The best parts were the location shots at Williams Bay on frozen Lake Geneva Wisc., including the inside of the Yerkes Observatory and Keanu spinning around on an "everglades like" hovercraft just missing some 'Sconnie fish houses. But all in all, I'd say take a pass on CHAIN REACTION unless nothing else is on.

    Eddie Kasalivich is a student machinist working on a project at the University of Chicago to obtain energy from water, when he discovers the secret of a process by which low-cost energy can be obtained from burning hydrogen, leaving only water as a residue. (The exact science is not always clear, but this appears to be some sort of nuclear fusion). Someone, however, obviously wants to sabotage Eddie's discovery, and one of his colleagues is murdered and the laboratory is destroyed in a massive explosion. Eddie and another colleague, Dr. Lily Sinclair, are questioned by the police and the FBI, and quickly realise that someone is trying to frame them for both the murder and the explosion. They are forced to go on the run to try and clear their names and to expose the true culprits. It is not just the science upon which the film is based that is unclear; the plot too is often over-elaborate and difficult to fathom. We eventually learn that the real villains are agents of the Government and of Big Business, who are desperate to suppress Eddie's discovery because they fear that a new cheap, environmentally friendly source of energy would make oil obsolete, force all oil companies into bankruptcy and lead to economic depression and social chaos. In fact, capitalism is rather more adaptable than the screenwriters imagine; a new energy source of this nature, by dramatically reducing industry's energy costs, would more likely lead to an economic boom and huge profits for those companies who could exploit this lucrative new technology. Existing energy companies would probably be among them, just as many stagecoach owners made a fortune from the invention of the steam train by re-investing their money in railway shares. The only people with a vested interest in preventing such inventions reaching the market would be the governments of those countries which possess vast reservoirs of crude oil and very little else, but the film-makers doubtless thought that, in paranoid conspiracy-thrillers like this one, the United States Government makes a better villain than do foreign ones. Keanu Reeves's performance as Eddie is adequate but not outstanding. Rachel Weisz as Lily, in her first starring role in a Hollywood film, is rather muted, and gives little indication that she would later develop into a major talent. Probably the best acting comes from the generally reliable Morgan Freeman as Paul Shannon, Eddie's old mentor who may have a sinister agenda, but "Chain Reaction" is not one of the really great Freeman films like "Glory", "Unforgiven" or "The Shawshank Redemption". The film does have some better qualities. The director Andrew Davis has been praised by his visual sense, and "Chain Reaction" is visually very attractive. The action takes place in winter and there is some striking photography of a wintry, snow-bound Chicago, especially the scenes set in the grim industrial districts and around the astronomical observatory which plays an important part in the plot. The action sequences are exciting, fast-moving and well handled. Davis has a reputation for specialising in thrillers. His films tend to vary in quality, but he has at least one very good one to his credit, "The Fugitive", one of the best thrillers of the nineties. (That film also dealt with a man forced to go on the run after being falsely accused of a crime). "Chain Reaction" is not in the same class as "The Fugitive", but it is a watchable thriller with some points of interest. 6/10
