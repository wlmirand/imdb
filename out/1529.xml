 <storyline>
  The story follows an underground weapons manufacturer in Belgrade during WWII and evolves into fairly surreal situations. A black marketeer who smuggles the weapons to partisans doesn't mention to the workers that the war is over, and they keep producing. Years later, they break out of their underground "shelter" --- only to convince themselves that the war is still going on.

    The "Underground" is a masterpiece by all means. I've always been a fun of Emir Kusturica's movies but this one was a real blast. I really disagree with many who categorize this film as a comedy. Neither can a soft word as "drama" really describe a movie such as this one. The characters endlessly ache for their country which is suffering a fatal war. The more their ignorance is getting bigger as the plot develops (reminding us Plato's Allegory of the Cave) the more the characters become tragic. Salvation ( for both the audience and the characters) is not to come until the very end. As a cinematographer Emir Kusturica has always achieved to portray the Balkan spirit's madness and proximateness with the most touching way. Watching this film means crying, laughing, hating, forgiving, aching all along with the heroes (or the anti-heroes). The regular fast rhythms, the symbolization and the surreal ways Kusturica uses in order to lead the audience where he wants to are also miraculous. To end with, the actors are amazing, the soundtrack (by Goran Bregovic of course) is breathtaking and this movie should not be missed for whatever the reason. 10/10

    Well, as I can see a lot of people had a same experience regarding this movie, you cried and you laughed. To be honest, no major difference in local understanding and experience after watching the film. However, living in a " story" or in the movie script is a bit of a different experience. Most of the people from ex-Yugoslavia or " notorious Balkan" would appreciate some better lives as well as happier history. However, this should not diminish film's brilliant language and its profound overview of man's nature and stupidity of war. Again, knowledge of local language or at least context would bring much more clarity and joy while watching this movie, but as mentioned - this is our problem... A piece of advice for all of my western friends - if the monkey enters the tank, keep your eyes open and try to pull him out at any cost. The country may still be there tomorrow...

    I struggled to explain to my sister why this was my ideal film. I showed it to her, pointed out my favourite moments and still she asked why I chose this film, so my choice might be more personal than I realise. But I'll try again: this exceptional film examines both how we fail as individuals and how we fail as a species, and yet it does so with an embracing enthusiasm for the other aspects of our humanity. The music is stunning, the acting is sublime, the characterizations are fully realised and believable, and the absurdity of what we watch unfold is never truly impossible. We are watching examples of misbehaving human beings and acknowledging, all along the way, that we recognize this behaviour. This film is a metaphor, but it is never detached from what its subject or its message - that history is a curse that comes to certain places at certain times and interrupts the natural flow of whom we could be without the extravagance of either ideology or self-interest.

    I thoroughly enjoyed parts of this film. It has moments of pure brilliance and hilarity; however, I'm afraid it's a movie that has great scenes but doesn't really work as a whole. There's a great deal of spirit and ambition in this film, but it just lags a lot in scenes, and the longer you watch it, the more it starts to lose focus, and much of the humor that made it so enjoyable towards the beginning. I did enjoy its unstructured plot, but interest level starts to wane after about the 2 hour mark. This one definitely could have used some cutting; however, this film does take place underground, and the visuals, the music and the setting make for a great atmosphere and a plot that is always unpredictable and filled with adventure, and fun; however, if you want to watch a Kusturica film, I'd go with his other one I've seen: Arizona Dream. It's equally bizarre but it has a much more engaging and interesting story.

    The film opens with the following text: "One upon a time there was a country": from there, what is narrated is, in a fifty-year arch, the story of two Communists, Blacky and Marko, living in Yugoslavia: both of them are at first involved in weapon trafficking during WWII: but before the war ends, friends and family of Blacky (except for Marko) hide underground and start a new life in there. After the war, they are still convinced, thanks also to Marko, that WWII is still going on, while Marko on the other hand rises to fame becoming a well-known politician, and makes the people of his country believe Blacky was a hero that died in the war. The reason of Marko lying is so that he can exploit his disillusioned friends to make weapons, for him to profit. Harshly criticized by many politicians because of it's rough and stereotyped representation of Yugoslavians, and because of its seemingly hypocritical nature, (a film which satirizes the country and applauds it at the same time) Underground was however critically acclaimed by movie-lovers because of its originality and strong character: whether this film (and Kusturica) is universally beloved, that is debatable; the exaggerations, the humor, and the anti-realistic scenes are not for everybody, and tone down the entertainment of the overall picture for whoever isn't "getting it".

    Whatever the underlying symbolism to do with the breakup of Yugoslavia, this film is a true great. The casting is fantastic and the acting craps all over the garbage I see in the cinema. I could not help but love every character in this movie I don't care about the historical accuracy or political connotations (though I would maybe feel differently if I was from that part of the world), to me it's like a celebration of life and all the grief that comes with it. If you have partisan feelings I would simply advise you to shelve them and admire the art instead. Watch it.

    Underground is a Serbian-France-Germany movie directed by Emir Kusturica. It is an allegorical tragicomedy about Yugoslavia, which mixes elements of surrealism (some very Bu&ntilde;uel-ish moments there), comedy of the absurd, neorealism, and &eacute;poque drama to offer a satirical drama about Yugoslavia - a conglomerate of nations formed by people who have lived in war, against others or against each other, for almost a century. The movie is structured in three parts: War, Cold War, War. The first is devoted to the WW II, the second to Tito's period, and the third to the civil war that would end with the disintegration of Yugoslavia. The second part is the most interesting -and the one that gives the movie its title- as it shows in a metaphorical way how Yugoslavs related to each other, deceived each other, exploited each other, lied to each other, and how things were building up in their spirit during those years. All the characters are well drawn, and all the actors do a great job in their respective roles. The main characters are a couple of rascal friends and a always-in-heat actress. In fact, they cannot be taken straightforward as they are three human archetypes. Marko -played by Miki Manojlovic- is the sort of people who say they have political beliefs and that they are fighting for them, when, in fact, they are using the juncture to thrive personally, despite everything and everybody. Cmi = Blacky -played by Lazar Ristovski- depicts those people who truly believe in what they preach and act accordingly, no matter what; however, they are so obsessed with their beliefs that will end being blind to reality. Finally, Natalija -played by Mirjana Jokovic- depicts those people who will always support the political regime in power, and will change and move on as the scenario does, always thriving. The counterpoint to these three is Ivan -played by Slavko Stimacy- Marko's mentally changed brother, who loves his monkey Soni more than any human and wants to hung himself all the time as he's always deceived and betrayed by everybody. Although all the themes touched in the movie are, indeed, very serious and dramatic, Kusturica's merit is to present them in a farce, and to talk about his people showing his love-hatred feelings, his feeling that they were predetermined to end the way they did, while putting a smile in the viewer's face. Some scenes of the movie are unforgettable because they are surreal, funny, or shocking. My two favorite ones are both at the end of the movie. The scenes at the square of the old village are terrific, visually shocking, provocative and unforgettable. The end with the "island" really explains the whole movie and contains one of the most beautiful images of the same. Some of the scenes related to the marriage of Blacky's son, the first outing of the son to the real world, and the shooting of the movie about Blacky, are also great. Some Bosnians and French philosophers have accused the movie and Kusturica of being pro-Serbian and sending pro-Serbian messages in his movie. However, to me, Kusturica's movie is more an exercise of evaluation of the human traits of the people who amalgamated Yugoslavia, as a whole, as all of them are to blame for the disintegration of the Balkan country in a way or another. Of course, Kusturica considering himself a Serbian and Ortodox, despite being born Bosnian and Muslim, he does not mention anything about the barbaric acts committed by the Serbians. However, we see best friends killing each others... anybody who wants to understand, will. The movie rarely mentions any ethnic group. Going now to the downs of the movie, I thought the movie was extremely long, not engaging at times. At the same time, I thought the movie looked like a TV series re color, texture of the film, and use of the camera, a thing that I don't like seeing in a proper big screen movie. And, alas, it is an adaptation for the big screen of a 5-hour TV-series. This would have not mattered if the editor had done a better job, that is, focused on the important and got rid of the superfluous. Two hours would have been more than enough to tell the same story. Otherwise, you can still watch the whole series. I found the music overbearing and annoying, although some of the individual pieces are beautiful, but there is that choondah-choondah nyiiiiiiiiii-nyiiiiiii sort of sound all along the movie that got into my nerves. However, the music goes well with the histrionics of the characters and the craziness of the story. It is shocking that a society that seems to be so keen on partying and on celebrating, so musical, would end being at war and killing each others. Once upon a time, there was a country... and people who were happy being together without hating each other and killing each other. Underground is, despite the appearances, a very sad movie as speaks of social and human failure.

    "Underground" is an epic tale of absurdity directed by Emir Kusturica using the tragedy of his motherland, who used to be called Yugoslavia, as the backdrop of the film. The history of this country can be compared to a deep wound that still can't be healed up. The land has been tortured, invaded, raped in her soul by the circumstances of History, it's still bleeding yet people never stopped to sing, to dance, to love, to believe in a brighter future. Such a personal story, so deeply rooted in Kusturica's heart, could have been told in a sad, dark and quite depressing tone, but a sad movie, "Underground" is not. And a hilarious imaginative poignant comedy, it sure is. Emir Kusturica's Golden Palm Winner is a masterpiece of flamboyance, of decadence and non-stop dance ... a never-ending party that revisits the tragedy of History and translates it into an epic, romantic and frenetic comedy, so damn entertaining these isn't a single moment I didn't want to get up on the table and start to dance with a glass on my hand, to Goran Bergovic's incredible soundtrack. Indeed, this film is full of music, of energy, of emotions and transports us into a fantastic journey in the tragic History of Yugoslavia, following a chronological road : World War II, the Cold War and of course, the Modern War. This final act is depicted in a darker tone, to highlight the loss of every thing that made Yugoslavia, a land of hope, of optimism and fraternity. But, never letting war and death pushing our mood down, Kusturica ends the film in an apotheosis. A great finale for a great movie about life and hope, to keep a great smile in your face until the end ... which the film doesn't have, because there's less optimism with an ending than with the belief of a rebirth after the mutilation of a never-ending war. But "Underground" isn't a documentary about this war, or about Yugoslavia. Basically, it's the story of a love triangle and an evil scheme. It starts with two men, two friends : Marko, the sympathetic opportunistic intellectual and his best friend Blacky who's just joined the Party, Blacky is an electrician, a lovable naive buffoon with a warm heart and a head made of stone. Marko and Blacky are both members of the Communist Party and resistant fighters after the partial destruction of the country by the German invasion. Those men love to drink, to dance, and more than that, they love the same woman : the actress Natalja. Natalja is a young, pretty, ambitious woman with many lovers, a Nazi officer, Blacky, her future husband and Marko her future lover. They're all flawed, exuberant, yet always sympathetic. But the lyric soul of the film is Yvan, Marko's brother, an innocent zoo guardian with a stammer and who developed a strange relationship with a monkey, Soni. He loves his brother, he's sweet and tender, and maybe he believes in animals more than men whose cruelty touched him deep in the heart. He seems to be the only who cares for what happens and carries the tragedy in his pure heart. After liberating Blacky from the Germans, Marko hides him in the cave, "underground", until the war stops ... Then Marko, who's been previously struck by Natalja's beauty will elaborate one of the most evil schemes ever plotted in film, just to keep her. He'll make all the population who lived, who were born and grew up in the cave, participate to the War Effort by making weapons for the Resistance ... even after the Liberation when the Allies achieved to destroy what the Germans left. Ivan, hidden in the cave, doesn't know the War is over. Blacky doesn't know the Iron Curtrain is drawn now and he's a dead legend above the ground. He doesn't even know that his best friend, is very close to Tito, and a respectable member of the Party, married to Natalja, an acclaimed actress. Natalja drowns her guilt and her loss of innocence in alcohol, she's weak but she's already been ... Natalja is a beautiful girl flirting with the enemy, married to a man, and having a love affair with another. She and Marko are both opportunistic, they understand each other. She can't hate him because he "lies so well". It's not her fault, she can't control her seductive power. Natalja is like an allegory of a beautiful country invaded numerous times during history, a country that doesn't know where her heart belongs anymore. Blacky and the poor victims of Comrade Marko lived in a cave during the Communism years, did they really miss more than those who lived above the ground ? The scheme is so evil Marko has an accomplice who found a trick to make time go slower, like life in an oppressive time make it seem slower. A diabolical absurd scheme, but no more or no less than the reality ... what better alibi for absurdity than war? Hot or Cold? War is ABSURD enough to inspire such acts ... The story is simply a fascinating metaphor of the more serious tragic fate of Kusturica's bruised motherland. But despite this sadness, the movie is about hope, joy and optimism ... these are the happiest and most cheerful people you'll see in a film, even during War, even when they fight, even in a cave, living years and years without seeing the sunlight, don't prevent them from amusement, dances, laughs, plays and everything that makes life worth to live ... the movie is a big Prison you never want to escape from. It's thrilling to watch, it's an optimistic tale for a tragic story ... you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll laugh and laugh and shout and fight and dance and have an extraordinary cinematic experience .... So, comrades, just have a glass and join the "party" ... Opaaaaaaaa!

    Underground by Emir Kusturica is absolutely phenomenal. Blending 60 years of history, wars, politics, ideas, lies and tragedy into 170mins with, irony, vibrancy, music, life, poetry and beauty whilst still retaining a genuine optimism in the face of it all. Effortlessly. An entertaining dark comedy that weaves how generations of people get screwed over by the corruption of their politicians and their own friends out for selfish gain. So much density of politics and history compressed into such a personal story expressed through actual war footage, real political figures, self reflexivity, theatricality, music and a totally relentless narrative that isn't afraid to switch up from comedy to tragedy from one scene to the next without pandering to formulaic structure in an effort to satisfy an audience.

    Underground is a film that relates a story about an underground gun factory that is created after the German invasion to Yugoslavia. This factory is created by Marko (Miki Manojlovic) inside a basement, basing his power over the people inside by lies. He tells the workers that the war still going and they should keep on building guns to help the communist, even after the war was over. Blacky (Lazar Ritovski) who is Marko's right hand man inside the factory, due to an accident with a grenade gets put inside the factory with the same lie told by Marko, and becomes the figure inside the basement colony. There he follows the communist rule that everything should be done without selfishness to help the colony in general, assimilating a perfect communist colony. This movie reflects the two sides of a war in general; one where you have a leader who is only persuading power and on the other side, that gets trapped inside the basement, you have one fighting for ideals and to help what he considers perfection on his surroundings.

Cmi = Blacky -played by Lazar Ristovski- depicts those people who truly believe in what they preach and act accordingly, no matter what; however, they are so obsessed with their beliefs that will end being blind to reality. Finally, Natalija -played by Mirjana Jokovic- depicts those people who will always support the political regime in power, and will change and move on as the scenario does, always thriving. The counterpoint to these three is Ivan -played by Slavko Stimacy- Marko's mentally changed brother, who loves his monkey Soni more than any human and wants to hung himself all the time as he's always deceived and betrayed by everybody. Although all the themes touched in the movie are, indeed, very serious and dramatic, Kusturica's merit is to present them in a farce, and to talk about his people showing his love-hatred feelings, his feeling that they were predetermined to end the way they did, while putting a smile in the viewer's face. Some scenes of the movie are unforgettable because they are surreal, funny, or shocking. My two favorite ones are both at the end of the movie. The scenes at the square of the old village are terrific, visually shocking, provocative and unforgettable. The end with the "island" really explains the whole movie and contains one of the most beautiful images of the same. Some of the scenes related to the marriage of Blacky's son, the first outing of the son to the real world, and the shooting of the movie about Blacky, are also great. Some Bosnians and French philosophers have accused the movie and Kusturica of being pro-Serbian and sending pro-Serbian messages in his movie. However, to me, Kusturica's movie is more an exercise of evaluation of the human traits of the people who amalgamated Yugoslavia, as a whole, as all of them are to blame for the disintegration of the Balkan country in a way or another. Of course, Kusturica considering himself a Serbian and Ortodox, despite being born Bosnian and Muslim, he does not mention anything about the barbaric acts committed by the Serbians. However, we see best friends killing each others... anybody who wants to understand, will. The movie rarely mentions any ethnic group. Going now to the downs of the movie, I thought the movie was extremely long, not engaging at times. At the same time, I thought the movie looked like a TV series re color, texture of the film, and use of the camera, a thing that I don't like seeing in a proper big screen movie. And, alas, it is an adaptation for the big screen of a 5-hour TV-series. This would have not mattered if the editor had done a better job, that is, focused on the important and got rid of the superfluous. Two hours would have been more than enough to tell the same story. Otherwise, you can still watch the whole series. I found the music overbearing and annoying, although some of the individual pieces are beautiful, but there is that choondah-choondah nyiiiiiiiiii-nyiiiiiii sort of sound all along the movie that got into my nerves. However, the music goes well with the histrionics of the characters and the craziness of the story. It is shocking that a society that seems to be so keen on partying and on celebrating, so musical, would end being at war and killing each others. Once upon a time, there was a country... and people who were happy being together without hating each other and killing each other. Underground is, despite the appearances, a very sad movie as speaks of social and human failure.

    "Underground" is an epic tale of absurdity directed by Emir Kusturica using the tragedy of his motherland, who used to be called Yugoslavia, as the backdrop of the film. The history of this country can be compared to a deep wound that still can't be healed up. The land has been tortured, invaded, raped in her soul by the circumstances of History, it's still bleeding yet people never stopped to sing, to dance, to love, to believe in a brighter future. Such a personal story, so deeply rooted in Kusturica's heart, could have been told in a sad, dark and quite depressing tone, but a sad movie, "Underground" is not. And a hilarious imaginative poignant comedy, it sure is. Emir Kusturica's Golden Palm Winner is a masterpiece of flamboyance, of decadence and non-stop dance ... a never-ending party that revisits the tragedy of History and translates it into an epic, romantic and frenetic comedy, so damn entertaining these isn't a single moment I didn't want to get up on the table and start to dance with a glass on my hand, to Goran Bergovic's incredible soundtrack. Indeed, this film is full of music, of energy, of emotions and transports us into a fantastic journey in the tragic History of Yugoslavia, following a chronological road : World War II, the Cold War and of course, the Modern War. This final act is depicted in a darker tone, to highlight the loss of every thing that made Yugoslavia, a land of hope, of optimism and fraternity. But, never letting war and death pushing our mood down, Kusturica ends the film in an apotheosis. A great finale for a great movie about life and hope, to keep a great smile in your face until the end ... which the film doesn't have, because there's less optimism with an ending than with the belief of a rebirth after the mutilation of a never-ending war. But "Underground" isn't a documentary about this war, or about Yugoslavia. Basically, it's the story of a love triangle and an evil scheme. It starts with two men, two friends : Marko, the sympathetic opportunistic intellectual and his best friend Blacky who's just joined the Party, Blacky is an electrician, a lovable naive buffoon with a warm heart and a head made of stone. Marko and Blacky are both members of the Communist Party and resistant fighters after the partial destruction of the country by the German invasion. Those men love to drink, to dance, and more than that, they love the same woman : the actress Natalja. Natalja is a young, pretty, ambitious woman with many lovers, a Nazi officer, Blacky, her future husband and Marko her future lover. They're all flawed, exuberant, yet always sympathetic. But the lyric soul of the film is Yvan, Marko's brother, an innocent zoo guardian with a stammer and who developed a strange relationship with a monkey, Soni. He loves his brother, he's sweet and tender, and maybe he believes in animals more than men whose cruelty touched him deep in the heart. He seems to be the only who cares for what happens and carries the tragedy in his pure heart. After liberating Blacky from the Germans, Marko hides him in the cave, "underground", until the war stops ... Then Marko, who's been previously struck by Natalja's beauty will elaborate one of the most evil schemes ever plotted in film, just to keep her. He'll make all the population who lived, who were born and grew up in the cave, participate to the War Effort by making weapons for the Resistance ... even after the Liberation when the Allies achieved to destroy what the Germans left. Ivan, hidden in the cave, doesn't know the War is over. Blacky doesn't know the Iron Curtrain is drawn now and he's a dead legend above the ground. He doesn't even know that his best friend, is very close to Tito, and a respectable member of the Party, married to Natalja, an acclaimed actress. Natalja drowns her guilt and her loss of innocence in alcohol, she's weak but she's already been ... Natalja is a beautiful girl flirting with the enemy, married to a man, and having a love affair with another. She and Marko are both opportunistic, they understand each other. She can't hate him because he "lies so well". It's not her fault, she can't control her seductive power. Natalja is like an allegory of a beautiful country invaded numerous times during history, a country that doesn't know where her heart belongs anymore. Blacky and the poor victims of Comrade Marko lived in a cave during the Communism years, did they really miss more than those who lived above the ground ? The scheme is so evil Marko has an accomplice who found a trick to make time go slower, like life in an oppressive time make it seem slower. A diabolical absurd scheme, but no more or no less than the reality ... what better alibi for absurdity than war? Hot or Cold? War is ABSURD enough to inspire such acts ... The story is simply a fascinating metaphor of the more serious tragic fate of Kusturica's bruised motherland. But despite this sadness, the movie is about hope, joy and optimism ... these are the happiest and most cheerful people you'll see in a film, even during War, even when they fight, even in a cave, living years and years without seeing the sunlight, don't prevent them from amusement, dances, laughs, plays and everything that makes life worth to live ... the movie is a big Prison you never want to escape from. It's thrilling to watch, it's an optimistic tale for a tragic story ... you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll laugh and laugh and shout and fight and dance and have an extraordinary cinematic experience .... So, comrades, just have a glass and join the "party" ... Opaaaaaaaa!

    Underground by Emir Kusturica is absolutely phenomenal. Blending 60 years of history, wars, politics, ideas, lies and tragedy into 170mins with, irony, vibrancy, music, life, poetry and beauty whilst still retaining a genuine optimism in the face of it all. Effortlessly. An entertaining dark comedy that weaves how generations of people get screwed over by the corruption of their politicians and their own friends out for selfish gain. So much density of politics and history compressed into such a personal story expressed through actual war footage, real political figures, self reflexivity, theatricality, music and a totally relentless narrative that isn't afraid to switch up from comedy to tragedy from one scene to the next without pandering to formulaic structure in an effort to satisfy an audience.

    Underground is a film that relates a story about an underground gun factory that is created after the German invasion to Yugoslavia. This factory is created by Marko (Miki Manojlovic) inside a basement, basing his power over the people inside by lies. He tells the workers that the war still going and they should keep on building guns to help the communist, even after the war was over. Blacky (Lazar Ritovski) who is Marko's right hand man inside the factory, due to an accident with a grenade gets put inside the factory with the same lie told by Marko, and becomes the figure inside the basement colony. There he follows the communist rule that everything should be done without selfishness to help the colony in general, assimilating a perfect communist colony. This movie reflects the two sides of a war in general; one where you have a leader who is only persuading power and on the other side, that gets trapped inside the basement, you have one fighting for ideals and to help what he considers perfection on his surroundings.

    The "Underground" is a masterpiece by all means. I've always been a fun of Emir Kusturica's movies but this one was a real blast. I really disagree with many who categorize this film as a comedy. Neither can a soft word as "drama" really describe a movie such as this one. The characters endlessly ache for their country which is suffering a fatal war. The more their ignorance is getting bigger as the plot develops (reminding us Plato's Allegory of the Cave) the more the characters become tragic. Salvation ( for both the audience and the characters) is not to come until the very end. As a cinematographer Emir Kusturica has always achieved to portray the Balkan spirit's madness and proximateness with the most touching way. Watching this film means crying, laughing, hating, forgiving, aching all along with the heroes (or the anti-heroes). The regular fast rhythms, the symbolization and the surreal ways Kusturica uses in order to lead the audience where he wants to are also miraculous. To end with, the actors are amazing, the soundtrack (by Goran Bregovic of course) is breathtaking and this movie should not be missed for whatever the reason. 10/10

    Well, as I can see a lot of people had a same experience regarding this movie, you cried and you laughed. To be honest, no major difference in local understanding and experience after watching the film. However, living in a " story" or in the movie script is a bit of a different experience. Most of the people from ex-Yugoslavia or " notorious Balkan" would appreciate some better lives as well as happier history. However, this should not diminish film's brilliant language and its profound overview of man's nature and stupidity of war. Again, knowledge of local language or at least context would bring much more clarity and joy while watching this movie, but as mentioned - this is our problem... A piece of advice for all of my western friends - if the monkey enters the tank, keep your eyes open and try to pull him out at any cost. The country may still be there tomorrow...

    I struggled to explain to my sister why this was my ideal film. I showed it to her, pointed out my favourite moments and still she asked why I chose this film, so my choice might be more personal than I realise. But I'll try again: this exceptional film examines both how we fail as individuals and how we fail as a species, and yet it does so with an embracing enthusiasm for the other aspects of our humanity. The music is stunning, the acting is sublime, the characterizations are fully realised and believable, and the absurdity of what we watch unfold is never truly impossible. We are watching examples of misbehaving human beings and acknowledging, all along the way, that we recognize this behaviour. This film is a metaphor, but it is never detached from what its subject or its message - that history is a curse that comes to certain places at certain times and interrupts the natural flow of whom we could be without the extravagance of either ideology or self-interest.

    I thoroughly enjoyed parts of this film. It has moments of pure brilliance and hilarity; however, I'm afraid it's a movie that has great scenes but doesn't really work as a whole. There's a great deal of spirit and ambition in this film, but it just lags a lot in scenes, and the longer you watch it, the more it starts to lose focus, and much of the humor that made it so enjoyable towards the beginning. I did enjoy its unstructured plot, but interest level starts to wane after about the 2 hour mark. This one definitely could have used some cutting; however, this film does take place underground, and the visuals, the music and the setting make for a great atmosphere and a plot that is always unpredictable and filled with adventure, and fun; however, if you want to watch a Kusturica film, I'd go with his other one I've seen: Arizona Dream. It's equally bizarre but it has a much more engaging and interesting story.

    The film opens with the following text: "One upon a time there was a country": from there, what is narrated is, in a fifty-year arch, the story of two Communists, Blacky and Marko, living in Yugoslavia: both of them are at first involved in weapon trafficking during WWII: but before the war ends, friends and family of Blacky (except for Marko) hide underground and start a new life in there. After the war, they are still convinced, thanks also to Marko, that WWII is still going on, while Marko on the other hand rises to fame becoming a well-known politician, and makes the people of his country believe Blacky was a hero that died in the war. The reason of Marko lying is so that he can exploit his disillusioned friends to make weapons, for him to profit. Harshly criticized by many politicians because of it's rough and stereotyped representation of Yugoslavians, and because of its seemingly hypocritical nature, (a film which satirizes the country and applauds it at the same time) Underground was however critically acclaimed by movie-lovers because of its originality and strong character: whether this film (and Kusturica) is universally beloved, that is debatable; the exaggerations, the humor, and the anti-realistic scenes are not for everybody, and tone down the entertainment of the overall picture for whoever isn't "getting it".

    Whatever the underlying symbolism to do with the breakup of Yugoslavia, this film is a true great. The casting is fantastic and the acting craps all over the garbage I see in the cinema. I could not help but love every character in this movie I don't care about the historical accuracy or political connotations (though I would maybe feel differently if I was from that part of the world), to me it's like a celebration of life and all the grief that comes with it. If you have partisan feelings I would simply advise you to shelve them and admire the art instead. Watch it.

    Underground is a Serbian-France-Germany movie directed by Emir Kusturica. It is an allegorical tragicomedy about Yugoslavia, which mixes elements of surrealism (some very Bu&ntilde;uel-ish moments there), comedy of the absurd, neorealism, and &eacute;poque drama to offer a satirical drama about Yugoslavia - a conglomerate of nations formed by people who have lived in war, against others or against each other, for almost a century. The movie is structured in three parts: War, Cold War, War. The first is devoted to the WW II, the second to Tito's period, and the third to the civil war that would end with the disintegration of Yugoslavia. The second part is the most interesting -and the one that gives the movie its title- as it shows in a metaphorical way how Yugoslavs related to each other, deceived each other, exploited each other, lied to each other, and how things were building up in their spirit during those years. All the characters are well drawn, and all the actors do a great job in their respective roles. The main characters are a couple of rascal friends and a always-in-heat actress. In fact, they cannot be taken straightforward as they are three human archetypes. Marko -played by Miki Manojlovic- is the sort of people who say they have political beliefs and that they are fighting for them, when, in fact, they are using the juncture to thrive personally, despite everything and everybody. Cmi = Blacky -played by Lazar Ristovski- depicts those people who truly believe in what they preach and act accordingly, no matter what; however, they are so obsessed with their beliefs that will end being blind to reality. Finally, Natalija -played by Mirjana Jokovic- depicts those people who will always support the political regime in power, and will change and move on as the scenario does, always thriving. The counterpoint to these three is Ivan -played by Slavko Stimacy- Marko's mentally changed brother, who loves his monkey Soni more than any human and wants to hung himself all the time as he's always deceived and betrayed by everybody. Although all the themes touched in the movie are, indeed, very serious and dramatic, Kusturica's merit is to present them in a farce, and to talk about his people showing his love-hatred feelings, his feeling that they were predetermined to end the way they did, while putting a smile in the viewer's face. Some scenes of the movie are unforgettable because they are surreal, funny, or shocking. My two favorite ones are both at the end of the movie. The scenes at the square of the old village are terrific, visually shocking, provocative and unforgettable. The end with the "island" really explains the whole movie and contains one of the most beautiful images of the same. Some of the scenes related to the marriage of Blacky's son, the first outing of the son to the real world, and the shooting of the movie about Blacky, are also great.

    The "Underground" is a masterpiece by all means. I've always been a fun of Emir Kusturica's movies but this one was a real blast. I really disagree with many who categorize this film as a comedy. Neither can a soft word as "drama" really describe a movie such as this one. The characters endlessly ache for their country which is suffering a fatal war. The more their ignorance is getting bigger as the plot develops (reminding us Plato's Allegory of the Cave) the more the characters become tragic. Salvation ( for both the audience and the characters) is not to come until the very end. As a cinematographer Emir Kusturica has always achieved to portray the Balkan spirit's madness and proximateness with the most touching way. Watching this film means crying, laughing, hating, forgiving, aching all along with the heroes (or the anti-heroes). The regular fast rhythms, the symbolization and the surreal ways Kusturica uses in order to lead the audience where he wants to are also miraculous. To end with, the actors are amazing, the soundtrack (by Goran Bregovic of course) is breathtaking and this movie should not be missed for whatever the reason. 10/10

    Well, as I can see a lot of people had a same experience regarding this movie, you cried and you laughed. To be honest, no major difference in local understanding and experience after watching the film. However, living in a " story" or in the movie script is a bit of a different experience. Most of the people from ex-Yugoslavia or " notorious Balkan" would appreciate some better lives as well as happier history. However, this should not diminish film's brilliant language and its profound overview of man's nature and stupidity of war. Again, knowledge of local language or at least context would bring much more clarity and joy while watching this movie, but as mentioned - this is our problem... A piece of advice for all of my western friends - if the monkey enters the tank, keep your eyes open and try to pull him out at any cost. The country may still be there tomorrow...

    I struggled to explain to my sister why this was my ideal film. I showed it to her, pointed out my favourite moments and still she asked why I chose this film, so my choice might be more personal than I realise. But I'll try again: this exceptional film examines both how we fail as individuals and how we fail as a species, and yet it does so with an embracing enthusiasm for the other aspects of our humanity. The music is stunning, the acting is sublime, the characterizations are fully realised and believable, and the absurdity of what we watch unfold is never truly impossible. We are watching examples of misbehaving human beings and acknowledging, all along the way, that we recognize this behaviour. This film is a metaphor, but it is never detached from what its subject or its message - that history is a curse that comes to certain places at certain times and interrupts the natural flow of whom we could be without the extravagance of either ideology or self-interest.

    I thoroughly enjoyed parts of this film. It has moments of pure brilliance and hilarity; however, I'm afraid it's a movie that has great scenes but doesn't really work as a whole. There's a great deal of spirit and ambition in this film, but it just lags a lot in scenes, and the longer you watch it, the more it starts to lose focus, and much of the humor that made it so enjoyable towards the beginning. I did enjoy its unstructured plot, but interest level starts to wane after about the 2 hour mark. This one definitely could have used some cutting; however, this film does take place underground, and the visuals, the music and the setting make for a great atmosphere and a plot that is always unpredictable and filled with adventure, and fun; however, if you want to watch a Kusturica film, I'd go with his other one I've seen: Arizona Dream. It's equally bizarre but it has a much more engaging and interesting story.

    The film opens with the following text: "One upon a time there was a country": from there, what is narrated is, in a fifty-year arch, the story of two Communists, Blacky and Marko, living in Yugoslavia: both of them are at first involved in weapon trafficking during WWII: but before the war ends, friends and family of Blacky (except for Marko) hide underground and start a new life in there. After the war, they are still convinced, thanks also to Marko, that WWII is still going on, while Marko on the other hand rises to fame becoming a well-known politician, and makes the people of his country believe Blacky was a hero that died in the war. The reason of Marko lying is so that he can exploit his disillusioned friends to make weapons, for him to profit. Harshly criticized by many politicians because of it's rough and stereotyped representation of Yugoslavians, and because of its seemingly hypocritical nature, (a film which satirizes the country and applauds it at the same time) Underground was however critically acclaimed by movie-lovers because of its originality and strong character: whether this film (and Kusturica) is universally beloved, that is debatable; the exaggerations, the humor, and the anti-realistic scenes are not for everybody, and tone down the entertainment of the overall picture for whoever isn't "getting it".

    Whatever the underlying symbolism to do with the breakup of Yugoslavia, this film is a true great. The casting is fantastic and the acting craps all over the garbage I see in the cinema. I could not help but love every character in this movie I don't care about the historical accuracy or political connotations (though I would maybe feel differently if I was from that part of the world), to me it's like a celebration of life and all the grief that comes with it. If you have partisan feelings I would simply advise you to shelve them and admire the art instead. Watch it.

    Underground is a Serbian-France-Germany movie directed by Emir Kusturica. It is an allegorical tragicomedy about Yugoslavia, which mixes elements of surrealism (some very Bu&ntilde;uel-ish moments there), comedy of the absurd, neorealism, and &eacute;poque drama to offer a satirical drama about Yugoslavia - a conglomerate of nations formed by people who have lived in war, against others or against each other, for almost a century. The movie is structured in three parts: War, Cold War, War. The first is devoted to the WW II, the second to Tito's period, and the third to the civil war that would end with the disintegration of Yugoslavia. The second part is the most interesting -and the one that gives the movie its title- as it shows in a metaphorical way how Yugoslavs related to each other, deceived each other, exploited each other, lied to each other, and how things were building up in their spirit during those years. All the characters are well drawn, and all the actors do a great job in their respective roles. The main characters are a couple of rascal friends and a always-in-heat actress. In fact, they cannot be taken straightforward as they are three human archetypes. Marko -played by Miki Manojlovic- is the sort of people who say they have political beliefs and that they are fighting for them, when, in fact, they are using the juncture to thrive personally, despite everything and everybody. Cmi = Blacky -played by Lazar Ristovski- depicts those people who truly believe in what they preach and act accordingly, no matter what; however, they are so obsessed with their beliefs that will end being blind to reality. Finally, Natalija -played by Mirjana Jokovic- depicts those people who will always support the political regime in power, and will change and move on as the scenario does, always thriving. The counterpoint to these three is Ivan -played by Slavko Stimacy- Marko's mentally changed brother, who loves his monkey Soni more than any human and wants to hung himself all the time as he's always deceived and betrayed by everybody. Although all the themes touched in the movie are, indeed, very serious and dramatic, Kusturica's merit is to present them in a farce, and to talk about his people showing his love-hatred feelings, his feeling that they were predetermined to end the way they did, while putting a smile in the viewer's face. Some scenes of the movie are unforgettable because they are surreal, funny, or shocking. My two favorite ones are both at the end of the movie. The scenes at the square of the old village are terrific, visually shocking, provocative and unforgettable. The end with the "island" really explains the whole movie and contains one of the most beautiful images of the same. Some of the scenes related to the marriage of Blacky's son, the first outing of the son to the real world, and the shooting of the movie about Blacky, are also great. Some Bosnians and French philosophers have accused the movie and Kusturica of being pro-Serbian and sending pro-Serbian messages in his movie. However, to me, Kusturica's movie is more an exercise of evaluation of the human traits of the people who amalgamated Yugoslavia, as a whole, as all of them are to blame for the disintegration of the Balkan country in a way or another. Of course, Kusturica considering himself a Serbian and Ortodox, despite being born Bosnian and Muslim, he does not mention anything about the barbaric acts committed by the Serbians. However, we see best friends killing each others... anybody who wants to understand, will. The movie rarely mentions any ethnic group. Going now to the downs of the movie, I thought the movie was extremely long, not engaging at times. At the same time, I thought the movie looked like a TV series re color, texture of the film, and use of the camera, a thing that I don't like seeing in a proper big screen movie. And, alas, it is an adaptation for the big screen of a 5-hour TV-series. This would have not mattered if the editor had done a better job, that is, focused on the important and got rid of the superfluous. Two hours would have been more than enough to tell the same story. Otherwise, you can still watch the whole series. I found the music overbearing and annoying, although some of the individual pieces are beautiful, but there is that choondah-choondah nyiiiiiiiiii-nyiiiiiii sort of sound all along the movie that got into my nerves. However, the music goes well with the histrionics of the characters and the craziness of the story. It is shocking that a society that seems to be so keen on partying and on celebrating, so musical, would end being at war and killing each others. Once upon a time, there was a country... and people who were happy being together without hating each other and killing each other. Underground is, despite the appearances, a very sad movie as speaks of social and human failure.

    "Underground" is an epic tale of absurdity directed by Emir Kusturica using the tragedy of his motherland, who used to be called Yugoslavia, as the backdrop of the film. The history of this country can be compared to a deep wound that still can't be healed up. The land has been tortured, invaded, raped in her soul by the circumstances of History, it's still bleeding yet people never stopped to sing, to dance, to love, to believe in a brighter future. Such a personal story, so deeply rooted in Kusturica's heart, could have been told in a sad, dark and quite depressing tone, but a sad movie, "Underground" is not. And a hilarious imaginative poignant comedy, it sure is. Emir Kusturica's Golden Palm Winner is a masterpiece of flamboyance, of decadence and non-stop dance ... a never-ending party that revisits the tragedy of History and translates it into an epic, romantic and frenetic comedy, so damn entertaining these isn't a single moment I didn't want to get up on the table and start to dance with a glass on my hand, to Goran Bergovic's incredible soundtrack. Indeed, this film is full of music, of energy, of emotions and transports us into a fantastic journey in the tragic History of Yugoslavia, following a chronological road : World War II, the Cold War and of course, the Modern War. This final act is depicted in a darker tone, to highlight the loss of every thing that made Yugoslavia, a land of hope, of optimism and fraternity. But, never letting war and death pushing our mood down, Kusturica ends the film in an apotheosis. A great finale for a great movie about life and hope, to keep a great smile in your face until the end ... which the film doesn't have, because there's less optimism with an ending than with the belief of a rebirth after the mutilation of a never-ending war. But "Underground" isn't a documentary about this war, or about Yugoslavia. Basically, it's the story of a love triangle and an evil scheme. It starts with two men, two friends : Marko, the sympathetic opportunistic intellectual and his best friend Blacky who's just joined the Party, Blacky is an electrician, a lovable naive buffoon with a warm heart and a head made of stone. Marko and Blacky are both members of the Communist Party and resistant fighters after the partial destruction of the country by the German invasion. Those men love to drink, to dance, and more than that, they love the same woman : the actress Natalja. Natalja is a young, pretty, ambitious woman with many lovers, a Nazi officer, Blacky, her future husband and Marko her future lover. They're all flawed, exuberant, yet always sympathetic. But the lyric soul of the film is Yvan, Marko's brother, an innocent zoo guardian with a stammer and who developed a strange relationship with a monkey, Soni. He loves his brother, he's sweet and tender, and maybe he believes in animals more than men whose cruelty touched him deep in the heart. He seems to be the only who cares for what happens and carries the tragedy in his pure heart. After liberating Blacky from the Germans, Marko hides him in the cave, "underground", until the war stops ... Then Marko, who's been previously struck by Natalja's beauty will elaborate one of the most evil schemes ever plotted in film, just to keep her. He'll make all the population who lived, who were born and grew up in the cave, participate to the War Effort by making weapons for the Resistance ... even after the Liberation when the Allies achieved to destroy what the Germans left. Ivan, hidden in the cave, doesn't know the War is over. Blacky doesn't know the Iron Curtrain is drawn now and he's a dead legend above the ground. He doesn't even know that his best friend, is very close to Tito, and a respectable member of the Party, married to Natalja, an acclaimed actress. Natalja drowns her guilt and her loss of innocence in alcohol, she's weak but she's already been ... Natalja is a beautiful girl flirting with the enemy, married to a man, and having a love affair with another. She and Marko are both opportunistic, they understand each other. She can't hate him because he "lies so well". It's not her fault, she can't control her seductive power. Natalja is like an allegory of a beautiful country invaded numerous times during history, a country that doesn't know where her heart belongs anymore. Blacky and the poor victims of Comrade Marko lived in a cave during the Communism years, did they really miss more than those who lived above the ground ? The scheme is so evil Marko has an accomplice who found a trick to make time go slower, like life in an oppressive time make it seem slower. A diabolical absurd scheme, but no more or no less than the reality ... what better alibi for absurdity than war? Hot or Cold? War is ABSURD enough to inspire such acts ... The story is simply a fascinating metaphor of the more serious tragic fate of Kusturica's bruised motherland. But despite this sadness, the movie is about hope, joy and optimism ... these are the happiest and most cheerful people you'll see in a film, even during War, even when they fight, even in a cave, living years and years without seeing the sunlight, don't prevent them from amusement, dances, laughs, plays and everything that makes life worth to live ... the movie is a big Prison you never want to escape from. It's thrilling to watch, it's an optimistic tale for a tragic story ... you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll laugh and laugh and shout and fight and dance and have an extraordinary cinematic experience .... So, comrades, just have a glass and join the "party" ... Opaaaaaaaa!

    Underground by Emir Kusturica is absolutely phenomenal. Blending 60 years of history, wars, politics, ideas, lies and tragedy into 170mins with, irony, vibrancy, music, life, poetry and beauty whilst still retaining a genuine optimism in the face of it all. Effortlessly. An entertaining dark comedy that weaves how generations of people get screwed over by the corruption of their politicians and their own friends out for selfish gain. So much density of politics and history compressed into such a personal story expressed through actual war footage, real political figures, self reflexivity, theatricality, music and a totally relentless narrative that isn't afraid to switch up from comedy to tragedy from one scene to the next without pandering to formulaic structure in an effort to satisfy an audience.

    Underground is a film that relates a story about an underground gun factory that is created after the German invasion to Yugoslavia. This factory is created by Marko (Miki Manojlovic) inside a basement, basing his power over the people inside by lies. He tells the workers that the war still going and they should keep on building guns to help the communist, even after the war was over. Blacky (Lazar Ritovski) who is Marko's right hand man inside the factory, due to an accident with a grenade gets put inside the factory with the same lie told by Marko, and becomes the figure inside the basement colony. There he follows the communist rule that everything should be done without selfishness to help the colony in general, assimilating a perfect communist colony. This movie reflects the two sides of a war in general; one where you have a leader who is only persuading power and on the other side, that gets trapped inside the basement, you have one fighting for ideals and to help what he considers perfection on his surroundings.

I found the music overbearing and annoying, although some of the individual pieces are beautiful, but there is that choondah-choondah nyiiiiiiiiii-nyiiiiiii sort of sound all along the movie that got into my nerves. However, the music goes well with the histrionics of the characters and the craziness of the story. It is shocking that a society that seems to be so keen on partying and on celebrating, so musical, would end being at war and killing each others. Once upon a time, there was a country... and people who were happy being together without hating each other and killing each other. Underground is, despite the appearances, a very sad movie as speaks of social and human failure.

    "Underground" is an epic tale of absurdity directed by Emir Kusturica using the tragedy of his motherland, who used to be called Yugoslavia, as the backdrop of the film. The history of this country can be compared to a deep wound that still can't be healed up. The land has been tortured, invaded, raped in her soul by the circumstances of History, it's still bleeding yet people never stopped to sing, to dance, to love, to believe in a brighter future. Such a personal story, so deeply rooted in Kusturica's heart, could have been told in a sad, dark and quite depressing tone, but a sad movie, "Underground" is not. And a hilarious imaginative poignant comedy, it sure is. Emir Kusturica's Golden Palm Winner is a masterpiece of flamboyance, of decadence and non-stop dance ... a never-ending party that revisits the tragedy of History and translates it into an epic, romantic and frenetic comedy, so damn entertaining these isn't a single moment I didn't want to get up on the table and start to dance with a glass on my hand, to Goran Bergovic's incredible soundtrack. Indeed, this film is full of music, of energy, of emotions and transports us into a fantastic journey in the tragic History of Yugoslavia, following a chronological road : World War II, the Cold War and of course, the Modern War. This final act is depicted in a darker tone, to highlight the loss of every thing that made Yugoslavia, a land of hope, of optimism and fraternity. But, never letting war and death pushing our mood down, Kusturica ends the film in an apotheosis. A great finale for a great movie about life and hope, to keep a great smile in your face until the end ... which the film doesn't have, because there's less optimism with an ending than with the belief of a rebirth after the mutilation of a never-ending war. But "Underground" isn't a documentary about this war, or about Yugoslavia. Basically, it's the story of a love triangle and an evil scheme. It starts with two men, two friends : Marko, the sympathetic opportunistic intellectual and his best friend Blacky who's just joined the Party, Blacky is an electrician, a lovable naive buffoon with a warm heart and a head made of stone. Marko and Blacky are both members of the Communist Party and resistant fighters after the partial destruction of the country by the German invasion. Those men love to drink, to dance, and more than that, they love the same woman : the actress Natalja. Natalja is a young, pretty, ambitious woman with many lovers, a Nazi officer, Blacky, her future husband and Marko her future lover. They're all flawed, exuberant, yet always sympathetic. But the lyric soul of the film is Yvan, Marko's brother, an innocent zoo guardian with a stammer and who developed a strange relationship with a monkey, Soni. He loves his brother, he's sweet and tender, and maybe he believes in animals more than men whose cruelty touched him deep in the heart. He seems to be the only who cares for what happens and carries the tragedy in his pure heart. After liberating Blacky from the Germans, Marko hides him in the cave, "underground", until the war stops ... Then Marko, who's been previously struck by Natalja's beauty will elaborate one of the most evil schemes ever plotted in film, just to keep her. He'll make all the population who lived, who were born and grew up in the cave, participate to the War Effort by making weapons for the Resistance ... even after the Liberation when the Allies achieved to destroy what the Germans left. Ivan, hidden in the cave, doesn't know the War is over. Blacky doesn't know the Iron Curtrain is drawn now and he's a dead legend above the ground. He doesn't even know that his best friend, is very close to Tito, and a respectable member of the Party, married to Natalja, an acclaimed actress. Natalja drowns her guilt and her loss of innocence in alcohol, she's weak but she's already been ... Natalja is a beautiful girl flirting with the enemy, married to a man, and having a love affair with another. She and Marko are both opportunistic, they understand each other. She can't hate him because he "lies so well". It's not her fault, she can't control her seductive power. Natalja is like an allegory of a beautiful country invaded numerous times during history, a country that doesn't know where her heart belongs anymore. Blacky and the poor victims of Comrade Marko lived in a cave during the Communism years, did they really miss more than those who lived above the ground ? The scheme is so evil Marko has an accomplice who found a trick to make time go slower, like life in an oppressive time make it seem slower. A diabolical absurd scheme, but no more or no less than the reality ... what better alibi for absurdity than war? Hot or Cold? War is ABSURD enough to inspire such acts ... The story is simply a fascinating metaphor of the more serious tragic fate of Kusturica's bruised motherland. But despite this sadness, the movie is about hope, joy and optimism ... these are the happiest and most cheerful people you'll see in a film, even during War, even when they fight, even in a cave, living years and years without seeing the sunlight, don't prevent them from amusement, dances, laughs, plays and everything that makes life worth to live ... the movie is a big Prison you never want to escape from. It's thrilling to watch, it's an optimistic tale for a tragic story ... you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll laugh and laugh and shout and fight and dance and have an extraordinary cinematic experience .... So, comrades, just have a glass and join the "party" ... Opaaaaaaaa!

    Underground by Emir Kusturica is absolutely phenomenal. Blending 60 years of history, wars, politics, ideas, lies and tragedy into 170mins with, irony, vibrancy, music, life, poetry and beauty whilst still retaining a genuine optimism in the face of it all. Effortlessly. An entertaining dark comedy that weaves how generations of people get screwed over by the corruption of their politicians and their own friends out for selfish gain. So much density of politics and history compressed into such a personal story expressed through actual war footage, real political figures, self reflexivity, theatricality, music and a totally relentless narrative that isn't afraid to switch up from comedy to tragedy from one scene to the next without pandering to formulaic structure in an effort to satisfy an audience.

    Underground is a film that relates a story about an underground gun factory that is created after the German invasion to Yugoslavia. This factory is created by Marko (Miki Manojlovic) inside a basement, basing his power over the people inside by lies. He tells the workers that the war still going and they should keep on building guns to help the communist, even after the war was over. Blacky (Lazar Ritovski) who is Marko's right hand man inside the factory, due to an accident with a grenade gets put inside the factory with the same lie told by Marko, and becomes the figure inside the basement colony. There he follows the communist rule that everything should be done without selfishness to help the colony in general, assimilating a perfect communist colony. This movie reflects the two sides of a war in general; one where you have a leader who is only persuading power and on the other side, that gets trapped inside the basement, you have one fighting for ideals and to help what he considers perfection on his surroundings.

    The "Underground" is a masterpiece by all means. I've always been a fun of Emir Kusturica's movies but this one was a real blast. I really disagree with many who categorize this film as a comedy. Neither can a soft word as "drama" really describe a movie such as this one. The characters endlessly ache for their country which is suffering a fatal war. The more their ignorance is getting bigger as the plot develops (reminding us Plato's Allegory of the Cave) the more the characters become tragic. Salvation ( for both the audience and the characters) is not to come until the very end. As a cinematographer Emir Kusturica has always achieved to portray the Balkan spirit's madness and proximateness with the most touching way. Watching this film means crying, laughing, hating, forgiving, aching all along with the heroes (or the anti-heroes). The regular fast rhythms, the symbolization and the surreal ways Kusturica uses in order to lead the audience where he wants to are also miraculous. To end with, the actors are amazing, the soundtrack (by Goran Bregovic of course) is breathtaking and this movie should not be missed for whatever the reason. 10/10

    Well, as I can see a lot of people had a same experience regarding this movie, you cried and you laughed. To be honest, no major difference in local understanding and experience after watching the film. However, living in a " story" or in the movie script is a bit of a different experience. Most of the people from ex-Yugoslavia or " notorious Balkan" would appreciate some better lives as well as happier history. However, this should not diminish film's brilliant language and its profound overview of man's nature and stupidity of war. Again, knowledge of local language or at least context would bring much more clarity and joy while watching this movie, but as mentioned - this is our problem... A piece of advice for all of my western friends - if the monkey enters the tank, keep your eyes open and try to pull him out at any cost. The country may still be there tomorrow...

    I struggled to explain to my sister why this was my ideal film. I showed it to her, pointed out my favourite moments and still she asked why I chose this film, so my choice might be more personal than I realise. But I'll try again: this exceptional film examines both how we fail as individuals and how we fail as a species, and yet it does so with an embracing enthusiasm for the other aspects of our humanity. The music is stunning, the acting is sublime, the characterizations are fully realised and believable, and the absurdity of what we watch unfold is never truly impossible. We are watching examples of misbehaving human beings and acknowledging, all along the way, that we recognize this behaviour. This film is a metaphor, but it is never detached from what its subject or its message - that history is a curse that comes to certain places at certain times and interrupts the natural flow of whom we could be without the extravagance of either ideology or self-interest.

    I thoroughly enjoyed parts of this film. It has moments of pure brilliance and hilarity; however, I'm afraid it's a movie that has great scenes but doesn't really work as a whole. There's a great deal of spirit and ambition in this film, but it just lags a lot in scenes, and the longer you watch it, the more it starts to lose focus, and much of the humor that made it so enjoyable towards the beginning. I did enjoy its unstructured plot, but interest level starts to wane after about the 2 hour mark. This one definitely could have used some cutting; however, this film does take place underground, and the visuals, the music and the setting make for a great atmosphere and a plot that is always unpredictable and filled with adventure, and fun; however, if you want to watch a Kusturica film, I'd go with his other one I've seen: Arizona Dream. It's equally bizarre but it has a much more engaging and interesting story.

    The film opens with the following text: "One upon a time there was a country": from there, what is narrated is, in a fifty-year arch, the story of two Communists, Blacky and Marko, living in Yugoslavia: both of them are at first involved in weapon trafficking during WWII: but before the war ends, friends and family of Blacky (except for Marko) hide underground and start a new life in there. After the war, they are still convinced, thanks also to Marko, that WWII is still going on, while Marko on the other hand rises to fame becoming a well-known politician, and makes the people of his country believe Blacky was a hero that died in the war. The reason of Marko lying is so that he can exploit his disillusioned friends to make weapons, for him to profit. Harshly criticized by many politicians because of it's rough and stereotyped representation of Yugoslavians, and because of its seemingly hypocritical nature, (a film which satirizes the country and applauds it at the same time) Underground was however critically acclaimed by movie-lovers because of its originality and strong character: whether this film (and Kusturica) is universally beloved, that is debatable; the exaggerations, the humor, and the anti-realistic scenes are not for everybody, and tone down the entertainment of the overall picture for whoever isn't "getting it".

    Whatever the underlying symbolism to do with the breakup of Yugoslavia, this film is a true great. The casting is fantastic and the acting craps all over the garbage I see in the cinema. I could not help but love every character in this movie I don't care about the historical accuracy or political connotations (though I would maybe feel differently if I was from that part of the world), to me it's like a celebration of life and all the grief that comes with it. If you have partisan feelings I would simply advise you to shelve them and admire the art instead. Watch it.

    Underground is a Serbian-France-Germany movie directed by Emir Kusturica. It is an allegorical tragicomedy about Yugoslavia, which mixes elements of surrealism (some very Bu&ntilde;uel-ish moments there), comedy of the absurd, neorealism, and &eacute;poque drama to offer a satirical drama about Yugoslavia - a conglomerate of nations formed by people who have lived in war, against others or against each other, for almost a century. The movie is structured in three parts: War, Cold War, War. The first is devoted to the WW II, the second to Tito's period, and the third to the civil war that would end with the disintegration of Yugoslavia. The second part is the most interesting -and the one that gives the movie its title- as it shows in a metaphorical way how Yugoslavs related to each other, deceived each other, exploited each other, lied to each other, and how things were building up in their spirit during those years. All the characters are well drawn, and all the actors do a great job in their respective roles. The main characters are a couple of rascal friends and a always-in-heat actress. In fact, they cannot be taken straightforward as they are three human archetypes. Marko -played by Miki Manojlovic- is the sort of people who say they have political beliefs and that they are fighting for them, when, in fact, they are using the juncture to thrive personally, despite everything and everybody. Cmi = Blacky -played by Lazar Ristovski- depicts those people who truly believe in what they preach and act accordingly, no matter what; however, they are so obsessed with their beliefs that will end being blind to reality. Finally, Natalija -played by Mirjana Jokovic- depicts those people who will always support the political regime in power, and will change and move on as the scenario does, always thriving. The counterpoint to these three is Ivan -played by Slavko Stimacy- Marko's mentally changed brother, who loves his monkey Soni more than any human and wants to hung himself all the time as he's always deceived and betrayed by everybody. Although all the themes touched in the movie are, indeed, very serious and dramatic, Kusturica's merit is to present them in a farce, and to talk about his people showing his love-hatred feelings, his feeling that they were predetermined to end the way they did, while putting a smile in the viewer's face. Some scenes of the movie are unforgettable because they are surreal, funny, or shocking. My two favorite ones are both at the end of the movie. The scenes at the square of the old village are terrific, visually shocking, provocative and unforgettable. The end with the "island" really explains the whole movie and contains one of the most beautiful images of the same. Some of the scenes related to the marriage of Blacky's son, the first outing of the son to the real world, and the shooting of the movie about Blacky, are also great. Some Bosnians and French philosophers have accused the movie and Kusturica of being pro-Serbian and sending pro-Serbian messages in his movie. However, to me, Kusturica's movie is more an exercise of evaluation of the human traits of the people who amalgamated Yugoslavia, as a whole, as all of them are to blame for the disintegration of the Balkan country in a way or another. Of course, Kusturica considering himself a Serbian and Ortodox, despite being born Bosnian and Muslim, he does not mention anything about the barbaric acts committed by the Serbians. However, we see best friends killing each others... anybody who wants to understand, will. The movie rarely mentions any ethnic group. Going now to the downs of the movie, I thought the movie was extremely long, not engaging at times. At the same time, I thought the movie looked like a TV series re color, texture of the film, and use of the camera, a thing that I don't like seeing in a proper big screen movie. And, alas, it is an adaptation for the big screen of a 5-hour TV-series. This would have not mattered if the editor had done a better job, that is, focused on the important and got rid of the superfluous. Two hours would have been more than enough to tell the same story. Otherwise, you can still watch the whole series. I found the music overbearing and annoying, although some of the individual pieces are beautiful, but there is that choondah-choondah nyiiiiiiiiii-nyiiiiiii sort of sound all along the movie that got into my nerves. However, the music goes well with the histrionics of the characters and the craziness of the story. It is shocking that a society that seems to be so keen on partying and on celebrating, so musical, would end being at war and killing each others. Once upon a time, there was a country... and people who were happy being together without hating each other and killing each other. Underground is, despite the appearances, a very sad movie as speaks of social and human failure.

    I struggled to explain to my sister why this was my ideal film. I showed it to her, pointed out my favourite moments and still she asked why I chose this film, so my choice might be more personal than I realise. But I'll try again: this exceptional film examines both how we fail as individuals and how we fail as a species, and yet it does so with an embracing enthusiasm for the other aspects of our humanity. The music is stunning, the acting is sublime, the characterizations are fully realised and believable, and the absurdity of what we watch unfold is never truly impossible. We are watching examples of misbehaving human beings and acknowledging, all along the way, that we recognize this behaviour. This film is a metaphor, but it is never detached from what its subject or its message - that history is a curse that comes to certain places at certain times and interrupts the natural flow of whom we could be without the extravagance of either ideology or self-interest.

    I thoroughly enjoyed parts of this film. It has moments of pure brilliance and hilarity; however, I'm afraid it's a movie that has great scenes but doesn't really work as a whole. There's a great deal of spirit and ambition in this film, but it just lags a lot in scenes, and the longer you watch it, the more it starts to lose focus, and much of the humor that made it so enjoyable towards the beginning. I did enjoy its unstructured plot, but interest level starts to wane after about the 2 hour mark. This one definitely could have used some cutting; however, this film does take place underground, and the visuals, the music and the setting make for a great atmosphere and a plot that is always unpredictable and filled with adventure, and fun; however, if you want to watch a Kusturica film, I'd go with his other one I've seen: Arizona Dream. It's equally bizarre but it has a much more engaging and interesting story.

    The film opens with the following text: "One upon a time there was a country": from there, what is narrated is, in a fifty-year arch, the story of two Communists, Blacky and Marko, living in Yugoslavia: both of them are at first involved in weapon trafficking during WWII: but before the war ends, friends and family of Blacky (except for Marko) hide underground and start a new life in there. After the war, they are still convinced, thanks also to Marko, that WWII is still going on, while Marko on the other hand rises to fame becoming a well-known politician, and makes the people of his country believe Blacky was a hero that died in the war. The reason of Marko lying is so that he can exploit his disillusioned friends to make weapons, for him to profit. Harshly criticized by many politicians because of it's rough and stereotyped representation of Yugoslavians, and because of its seemingly hypocritical nature, (a film which satirizes the country and applauds it at the same time) Underground was however critically acclaimed by movie-lovers because of its originality and strong character: whether this film (and Kusturica) is universally beloved, that is debatable; the exaggerations, the humor, and the anti-realistic scenes are not for everybody, and tone down the entertainment of the overall picture for whoever isn't "getting it".

    Whatever the underlying symbolism to do with the breakup of Yugoslavia, this film is a true great. The casting is fantastic and the acting craps all over the garbage I see in the cinema. I could not help but love every character in this movie I don't care about the historical accuracy or political connotations (though I would maybe feel differently if I was from that part of the world), to me it's like a celebration of life and all the grief that comes with it. If you have partisan feelings I would simply advise you to shelve them and admire the art instead. Watch it.

    Underground is a Serbian-France-Germany movie directed by Emir Kusturica. It is an allegorical tragicomedy about Yugoslavia, which mixes elements of surrealism (some very Bu&ntilde;uel-ish moments there), comedy of the absurd, neorealism, and &eacute;poque drama to offer a satirical drama about Yugoslavia - a conglomerate of nations formed by people who have lived in war, against others or against each other, for almost a century. The movie is structured in three parts: War, Cold War, War. The first is devoted to the WW II, the second to Tito's period, and the third to the civil war that would end with the disintegration of Yugoslavia. The second part is the most interesting -and the one that gives the movie its title- as it shows in a metaphorical way how Yugoslavs related to each other, deceived each other, exploited each other, lied to each other, and how things were building up in their spirit during those years. All the characters are well drawn, and all the actors do a great job in their respective roles. The main characters are a couple of rascal friends and a always-in-heat actress. In fact, they cannot be taken straightforward as they are three human archetypes. Marko -played by Miki Manojlovic- is the sort of people who say they have political beliefs and that they are fighting for them, when, in fact, they are using the juncture to thrive personally, despite everything and everybody. Cmi = Blacky -played by Lazar Ristovski- depicts those people who truly believe in what they preach and act accordingly, no matter what; however, they are so obsessed with their beliefs that will end being blind to reality. Finally, Natalija -played by Mirjana Jokovic- depicts those people who will always support the political regime in power, and will change and move on as the scenario does, always thriving. The counterpoint to these three is Ivan -played by Slavko Stimacy- Marko's mentally changed brother, who loves his monkey Soni more than any human and wants to hung himself all the time as he's always deceived and betrayed by everybody. Although all the themes touched in the movie are, indeed, very serious and dramatic, Kusturica's merit is to present them in a farce, and to talk about his people showing his love-hatred feelings, his feeling that they were predetermined to end the way they did, while putting a smile in the viewer's face. Some scenes of the movie are unforgettable because they are surreal, funny, or shocking. My two favorite ones are both at the end of the movie. The scenes at the square of the old village are terrific, visually shocking, provocative and unforgettable. The end with the "island" really explains the whole movie and contains one of the most beautiful images of the same. Some of the scenes related to the marriage of Blacky's son, the first outing of the son to the real world, and the shooting of the movie about Blacky, are also great. Some Bosnians and French philosophers have accused the movie and Kusturica of being pro-Serbian and sending pro-Serbian messages in his movie. However, to me, Kusturica's movie is more an exercise of evaluation of the human traits of the people who amalgamated Yugoslavia, as a whole, as all of them are to blame for the disintegration of the Balkan country in a way or another. Of course, Kusturica considering himself a Serbian and Ortodox, despite being born Bosnian and Muslim, he does not mention anything about the barbaric acts committed by the Serbians. However, we see best friends killing each others... anybody who wants to understand, will. The movie rarely mentions any ethnic group. Going now to the downs of the movie, I thought the movie was extremely long, not engaging at times. At the same time, I thought the movie looked like a TV series re color, texture of the film, and use of the camera, a thing that I don't like seeing in a proper big screen movie. And, alas, it is an adaptation for the big screen of a 5-hour TV-series. This would have not mattered if the editor had done a better job, that is, focused on the important and got rid of the superfluous. Two hours would have been more than enough to tell the same story. Otherwise, you can still watch the whole series. I found the music overbearing and annoying, although some of the individual pieces are beautiful, but there is that choondah-choondah nyiiiiiiiiii-nyiiiiiii sort of sound all along the movie that got into my nerves. However, the music goes well with the histrionics of the characters and the craziness of the story. It is shocking that a society that seems to be so keen on partying and on celebrating, so musical, would end being at war and killing each others. Once upon a time, there was a country... and people who were happy being together without hating each other and killing each other. Underground is, despite the appearances, a very sad movie as speaks of social and human failure.

    "Underground" is an epic tale of absurdity directed by Emir Kusturica using the tragedy of his motherland, who used to be called Yugoslavia, as the backdrop of the film. The history of this country can be compared to a deep wound that still can't be healed up. The land has been tortured, invaded, raped in her soul by the circumstances of History, it's still bleeding yet people never stopped to sing, to dance, to love, to believe in a brighter future. Such a personal story, so deeply rooted in Kusturica's heart, could have been told in a sad, dark and quite depressing tone, but a sad movie, "Underground" is not. And a hilarious imaginative poignant comedy, it sure is. Emir Kusturica's Golden Palm Winner is a masterpiece of flamboyance, of decadence and non-stop dance ... a never-ending party that revisits the tragedy of History and translates it into an epic, romantic and frenetic comedy, so damn entertaining these isn't a single moment I didn't want to get up on the table and start to dance with a glass on my hand, to Goran Bergovic's incredible soundtrack. Indeed, this film is full of music, of energy, of emotions and transports us into a fantastic journey in the tragic History of Yugoslavia, following a chronological road : World War II, the Cold War and of course, the Modern War. This final act is depicted in a darker tone, to highlight the loss of every thing that made Yugoslavia, a land of hope, of optimism and fraternity. But, never letting war and death pushing our mood down, Kusturica ends the film in an apotheosis. A great finale for a great movie about life and hope, to keep a great smile in your face until the end ... which the film doesn't have, because there's less optimism with an ending than with the belief of a rebirth after the mutilation of a never-ending war. But "Underground" isn't a documentary about this war, or about Yugoslavia. Basically, it's the story of a love triangle and an evil scheme. It starts with two men, two friends : Marko, the sympathetic opportunistic intellectual and his best friend Blacky who's just joined the Party, Blacky is an electrician, a lovable naive buffoon with a warm heart and a head made of stone. Marko and Blacky are both members of the Communist Party and resistant fighters after the partial destruction of the country by the German invasion. Those men love to drink, to dance, and more than that, they love the same woman : the actress Natalja. Natalja is a young, pretty, ambitious woman with many lovers, a Nazi officer, Blacky, her future husband and Marko her future lover. They're all flawed, exuberant, yet always sympathetic. But the lyric soul of the film is Yvan, Marko's brother, an innocent zoo guardian with a stammer and who developed a strange relationship with a monkey, Soni. He loves his brother, he's sweet and tender, and maybe he believes in animals more than men whose cruelty touched him deep in the heart. He seems to be the only who cares for what happens and carries the tragedy in his pure heart. After liberating Blacky from the Germans, Marko hides him in the cave, "underground", until the war stops ... Then Marko, who's been previously struck by Natalja's beauty will elaborate one of the most evil schemes ever plotted in film, just to keep her. He'll make all the population who lived, who were born and grew up in the cave, participate to the War Effort by making weapons for the Resistance ... even after the Liberation when the Allies achieved to destroy what the Germans left. Ivan, hidden in the cave, doesn't know the War is over. Blacky doesn't know the Iron Curtrain is drawn now and he's a dead legend above the ground. He doesn't even know that his best friend, is very close to Tito, and a respectable member of the Party, married to Natalja, an acclaimed actress. Natalja drowns her guilt and her loss of innocence in alcohol, she's weak but she's already been ... Natalja is a beautiful girl flirting with the enemy, married to a man, and having a love affair with another. She and Marko are both opportunistic, they understand each other. She can't hate him because he "lies so well". It's not her fault, she can't control her seductive power. Natalja is like an allegory of a beautiful country invaded numerous times during history, a country that doesn't know where her heart belongs anymore. Blacky and the poor victims of Comrade Marko lived in a cave during the Communism years, did they really miss more than those who lived above the ground ? The scheme is so evil Marko has an accomplice who found a trick to make time go slower, like life in an oppressive time make it seem slower. A diabolical absurd scheme, but no more or no less than the reality ... what better alibi for absurdity than war? Hot or Cold? War is ABSURD enough to inspire such acts ... The story is simply a fascinating metaphor of the more serious tragic fate of Kusturica's bruised motherland. But despite this sadness, the movie is about hope, joy and optimism ... these are the happiest and most cheerful people you'll see in a film, even during War, even when they fight, even in a cave, living years and years without seeing the sunlight, don't prevent them from amusement, dances, laughs, plays and everything that makes life worth to live ... the movie is a big Prison you never want to escape from. It's thrilling to watch, it's an optimistic tale for a tragic story ... you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll laugh and laugh and shout and fight and dance and have an extraordinary cinematic experience .... So, comrades, just have a glass and join the "party" ... Opaaaaaaaa!

    Underground by Emir Kusturica is absolutely phenomenal. Blending 60 years of history, wars, politics, ideas, lies and tragedy into 170mins with, irony, vibrancy, music, life, poetry and beauty whilst still retaining a genuine optimism in the face of it all. Effortlessly. An entertaining dark comedy that weaves how generations of people get screwed over by the corruption of their politicians and their own friends out for selfish gain. So much density of politics and history compressed into such a personal story expressed through actual war footage, real political figures, self reflexivity, theatricality, music and a totally relentless narrative that isn't afraid to switch up from comedy to tragedy from one scene to the next without pandering to formulaic structure in an effort to satisfy an audience.

    Underground is a film that relates a story about an underground gun factory that is created after the German invasion to Yugoslavia. This factory is created by Marko (Miki Manojlovic) inside a basement, basing his power over the people inside by lies. He tells the workers that the war still going and they should keep on building guns to help the communist, even after the war was over. Blacky (Lazar Ritovski) who is Marko's right hand man inside the factory, due to an accident with a grenade gets put inside the factory with the same lie told by Marko, and becomes the figure inside the basement colony. There he follows the communist rule that everything should be done without selfishness to help the colony in general, assimilating a perfect communist colony. This movie reflects the two sides of a war in general; one where you have a leader who is only persuading power and on the other side, that gets trapped inside the basement, you have one fighting for ideals and to help what he considers perfection on his surroundings.

    The "Underground" is a masterpiece by all means. I've always been a fun of Emir Kusturica's movies but this one was a real blast. I really disagree with many who categorize this film as a comedy. Neither can a soft word as "drama" really describe a movie such as this one. The characters endlessly ache for their country which is suffering a fatal war. The more their ignorance is getting bigger as the plot develops (reminding us Plato's Allegory of the Cave) the more the characters become tragic. Salvation ( for both the audience and the characters) is not to come until the very end. As a cinematographer Emir Kusturica has always achieved to portray the Balkan spirit's madness and proximateness with the most touching way. Watching this film means crying, laughing, hating, forgiving, aching all along with the heroes (or the anti-heroes). The regular fast rhythms, the symbolization and the surreal ways Kusturica uses in order to lead the audience where he wants to are also miraculous. To end with, the actors are amazing, the soundtrack (by Goran Bregovic of course) is breathtaking and this movie should not be missed for whatever the reason. 10/10

    Well, as I can see a lot of people had a same experience regarding this movie, you cried and you laughed. To be honest, no major difference in local understanding and experience after watching the film. However, living in a " story" or in the movie script is a bit of a different experience. Most of the people from ex-Yugoslavia or " notorious Balkan" would appreciate some better lives as well as happier history. However, this should not diminish film's brilliant language and its profound overview of man's nature and stupidity of war. Again, knowledge of local language or at least context would bring much more clarity and joy while watching this movie, but as mentioned - this is our problem... A piece of advice for all of my western friends - if the monkey enters the tank, keep your eyes open and try to pull him out at any cost. The country may still be there tomorrow...

A great finale for a great movie about life and hope, to keep a great smile in your face until the end ... which the film doesn't have, because there's less optimism with an ending than with the belief of a rebirth after the mutilation of a never-ending war. But "Underground" isn't a documentary about this war, or about Yugoslavia. Basically, it's the story of a love triangle and an evil scheme. It starts with two men, two friends : Marko, the sympathetic opportunistic intellectual and his best friend Blacky who's just joined the Party, Blacky is an electrician, a lovable naive buffoon with a warm heart and a head made of stone. Marko and Blacky are both members of the Communist Party and resistant fighters after the partial destruction of the country by the German invasion. Those men love to drink, to dance, and more than that, they love the same woman : the actress Natalja. Natalja is a young, pretty, ambitious woman with many lovers, a Nazi officer, Blacky, her future husband and Marko her future lover. They're all flawed, exuberant, yet always sympathetic. But the lyric soul of the film is Yvan, Marko's brother, an innocent zoo guardian with a stammer and who developed a strange relationship with a monkey, Soni. He loves his brother, he's sweet and tender, and maybe he believes in animals more than men whose cruelty touched him deep in the heart. He seems to be the only who cares for what happens and carries the tragedy in his pure heart. After liberating Blacky from the Germans, Marko hides him in the cave, "underground", until the war stops ... Then Marko, who's been previously struck by Natalja's beauty will elaborate one of the most evil schemes ever plotted in film, just to keep her. He'll make all the population who lived, who were born and grew up in the cave, participate to the War Effort by making weapons for the Resistance ... even after the Liberation when the Allies achieved to destroy what the Germans left. Ivan, hidden in the cave, doesn't know the War is over. Blacky doesn't know the Iron Curtrain is drawn now and he's a dead legend above the ground. He doesn't even know that his best friend, is very close to Tito, and a respectable member of the Party, married to Natalja, an acclaimed actress. Natalja drowns her guilt and her loss of innocence in alcohol, she's weak but she's already been ... Natalja is a beautiful girl flirting with the enemy, married to a man, and having a love affair with another. She and Marko are both opportunistic, they understand each other. She can't hate him because he "lies so well". It's not her fault, she can't control her seductive power. Natalja is like an allegory of a beautiful country invaded numerous times during history, a country that doesn't know where her heart belongs anymore. Blacky and the poor victims of Comrade Marko lived in a cave during the Communism years, did they really miss more than those who lived above the ground ? The scheme is so evil Marko has an accomplice who found a trick to make time go slower, like life in an oppressive time make it seem slower. A diabolical absurd scheme, but no more or no less than the reality ... what better alibi for absurdity than war? Hot or Cold? War is ABSURD enough to inspire such acts ... The story is simply a fascinating metaphor of the more serious tragic fate of Kusturica's bruised motherland. But despite this sadness, the movie is about hope, joy and optimism ... these are the happiest and most cheerful people you'll see in a film, even during War, even when they fight, even in a cave, living years and years without seeing the sunlight, don't prevent them from amusement, dances, laughs, plays and everything that makes life worth to live ... the movie is a big Prison you never want to escape from. It's thrilling to watch, it's an optimistic tale for a tragic story ... you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll laugh and laugh and shout and fight and dance and have an extraordinary cinematic experience .... So, comrades, just have a glass and join the "party" ... Opaaaaaaaa!

    Underground by Emir Kusturica is absolutely phenomenal. Blending 60 years of history, wars, politics, ideas, lies and tragedy into 170mins with, irony, vibrancy, music, life, poetry and beauty whilst still retaining a genuine optimism in the face of it all. Effortlessly. An entertaining dark comedy that weaves how generations of people get screwed over by the corruption of their politicians and their own friends out for selfish gain. So much density of politics and history compressed into such a personal story expressed through actual war footage, real political figures, self reflexivity, theatricality, music and a totally relentless narrative that isn't afraid to switch up from comedy to tragedy from one scene to the next without pandering to formulaic structure in an effort to satisfy an audience.

    Underground is a film that relates a story about an underground gun factory that is created after the German invasion to Yugoslavia. This factory is created by Marko (Miki Manojlovic) inside a basement, basing his power over the people inside by lies. He tells the workers that the war still going and they should keep on building guns to help the communist, even after the war was over. Blacky (Lazar Ritovski) who is Marko's right hand man inside the factory, due to an accident with a grenade gets put inside the factory with the same lie told by Marko, and becomes the figure inside the basement colony. There he follows the communist rule that everything should be done without selfishness to help the colony in general, assimilating a perfect communist colony. This movie reflects the two sides of a war in general; one where you have a leader who is only persuading power and on the other side, that gets trapped inside the basement, you have one fighting for ideals and to help what he considers perfection on his surroundings.

    The "Underground" is a masterpiece by all means. I've always been a fun of Emir Kusturica's movies but this one was a real blast. I really disagree with many who categorize this film as a comedy. Neither can a soft word as "drama" really describe a movie such as this one. The characters endlessly ache for their country which is suffering a fatal war. The more their ignorance is getting bigger as the plot develops (reminding us Plato's Allegory of the Cave) the more the characters become tragic. Salvation ( for both the audience and the characters) is not to come until the very end. As a cinematographer Emir Kusturica has always achieved to portray the Balkan spirit's madness and proximateness with the most touching way. Watching this film means crying, laughing, hating, forgiving, aching all along with the heroes (or the anti-heroes). The regular fast rhythms, the symbolization and the surreal ways Kusturica uses in order to lead the audience where he wants to are also miraculous. To end with, the actors are amazing, the soundtrack (by Goran Bregovic of course) is breathtaking and this movie should not be missed for whatever the reason. 10/10

    Well, as I can see a lot of people had a same experience regarding this movie, you cried and you laughed. To be honest, no major difference in local understanding and experience after watching the film. However, living in a " story" or in the movie script is a bit of a different experience. Most of the people from ex-Yugoslavia or " notorious Balkan" would appreciate some better lives as well as happier history. However, this should not diminish film's brilliant language and its profound overview of man's nature and stupidity of war. Again, knowledge of local language or at least context would bring much more clarity and joy while watching this movie, but as mentioned - this is our problem... A piece of advice for all of my western friends - if the monkey enters the tank, keep your eyes open and try to pull him out at any cost. The country may still be there tomorrow...

    I struggled to explain to my sister why this was my ideal film. I showed it to her, pointed out my favourite moments and still she asked why I chose this film, so my choice might be more personal than I realise. But I'll try again: this exceptional film examines both how we fail as individuals and how we fail as a species, and yet it does so with an embracing enthusiasm for the other aspects of our humanity. The music is stunning, the acting is sublime, the characterizations are fully realised and believable, and the absurdity of what we watch unfold is never truly impossible. We are watching examples of misbehaving human beings and acknowledging, all along the way, that we recognize this behaviour. This film is a metaphor, but it is never detached from what its subject or its message - that history is a curse that comes to certain places at certain times and interrupts the natural flow of whom we could be without the extravagance of either ideology or self-interest.

    I thoroughly enjoyed parts of this film. It has moments of pure brilliance and hilarity; however, I'm afraid it's a movie that has great scenes but doesn't really work as a whole. There's a great deal of spirit and ambition in this film, but it just lags a lot in scenes, and the longer you watch it, the more it starts to lose focus, and much of the humor that made it so enjoyable towards the beginning. I did enjoy its unstructured plot, but interest level starts to wane after about the 2 hour mark. This one definitely could have used some cutting; however, this film does take place underground, and the visuals, the music and the setting make for a great atmosphere and a plot that is always unpredictable and filled with adventure, and fun; however, if you want to watch a Kusturica film, I'd go with his other one I've seen: Arizona Dream. It's equally bizarre but it has a much more engaging and interesting story.

    The film opens with the following text: "One upon a time there was a country": from there, what is narrated is, in a fifty-year arch, the story of two Communists, Blacky and Marko, living in Yugoslavia: both of them are at first involved in weapon trafficking during WWII: but before the war ends, friends and family of Blacky (except for Marko) hide underground and start a new life in there. After the war, they are still convinced, thanks also to Marko, that WWII is still going on, while Marko on the other hand rises to fame becoming a well-known politician, and makes the people of his country believe Blacky was a hero that died in the war. The reason of Marko lying is so that he can exploit his disillusioned friends to make weapons, for him to profit. Harshly criticized by many politicians because of it's rough and stereotyped representation of Yugoslavians, and because of its seemingly hypocritical nature, (a film which satirizes the country and applauds it at the same time) Underground was however critically acclaimed by movie-lovers because of its originality and strong character: whether this film (and Kusturica) is universally beloved, that is debatable; the exaggerations, the humor, and the anti-realistic scenes are not for everybody, and tone down the entertainment of the overall picture for whoever isn't "getting it".

    Whatever the underlying symbolism to do with the breakup of Yugoslavia, this film is a true great. The casting is fantastic and the acting craps all over the garbage I see in the cinema. I could not help but love every character in this movie I don't care about the historical accuracy or political connotations (though I would maybe feel differently if I was from that part of the world), to me it's like a celebration of life and all the grief that comes with it. If you have partisan feelings I would simply advise you to shelve them and admire the art instead. Watch it.

    Underground is a Serbian-France-Germany movie directed by Emir Kusturica. It is an allegorical tragicomedy about Yugoslavia, which mixes elements of surrealism (some very Bu&ntilde;uel-ish moments there), comedy of the absurd, neorealism, and &eacute;poque drama to offer a satirical drama about Yugoslavia - a conglomerate of nations formed by people who have lived in war, against others or against each other, for almost a century. The movie is structured in three parts: War, Cold War, War. The first is devoted to the WW II, the second to Tito's period, and the third to the civil war that would end with the disintegration of Yugoslavia. The second part is the most interesting -and the one that gives the movie its title- as it shows in a metaphorical way how Yugoslavs related to each other, deceived each other, exploited each other, lied to each other, and how things were building up in their spirit during those years. All the characters are well drawn, and all the actors do a great job in their respective roles. The main characters are a couple of rascal friends and a always-in-heat actress. In fact, they cannot be taken straightforward as they are three human archetypes. Marko -played by Miki Manojlovic- is the sort of people who say they have political beliefs and that they are fighting for them, when, in fact, they are using the juncture to thrive personally, despite everything and everybody. Cmi = Blacky -played by Lazar Ristovski- depicts those people who truly believe in what they preach and act accordingly, no matter what; however, they are so obsessed with their beliefs that will end being blind to reality. Finally, Natalija -played by Mirjana Jokovic- depicts those people who will always support the political regime in power, and will change and move on as the scenario does, always thriving. The counterpoint to these three is Ivan -played by Slavko Stimacy- Marko's mentally changed brother, who loves his monkey Soni more than any human and wants to hung himself all the time as he's always deceived and betrayed by everybody. Although all the themes touched in the movie are, indeed, very serious and dramatic, Kusturica's merit is to present them in a farce, and to talk about his people showing his love-hatred feelings, his feeling that they were predetermined to end the way they did, while putting a smile in the viewer's face. Some scenes of the movie are unforgettable because they are surreal, funny, or shocking. My two favorite ones are both at the end of the movie. The scenes at the square of the old village are terrific, visually shocking, provocative and unforgettable. The end with the "island" really explains the whole movie and contains one of the most beautiful images of the same. Some of the scenes related to the marriage of Blacky's son, the first outing of the son to the real world, and the shooting of the movie about Blacky, are also great. Some Bosnians and French philosophers have accused the movie and Kusturica of being pro-Serbian and sending pro-Serbian messages in his movie. However, to me, Kusturica's movie is more an exercise of evaluation of the human traits of the people who amalgamated Yugoslavia, as a whole, as all of them are to blame for the disintegration of the Balkan country in a way or another. Of course, Kusturica considering himself a Serbian and Ortodox, despite being born Bosnian and Muslim, he does not mention anything about the barbaric acts committed by the Serbians. However, we see best friends killing each others... anybody who wants to understand, will. The movie rarely mentions any ethnic group. Going now to the downs of the movie, I thought the movie was extremely long, not engaging at times. At the same time, I thought the movie looked like a TV series re color, texture of the film, and use of the camera, a thing that I don't like seeing in a proper big screen movie. And, alas, it is an adaptation for the big screen of a 5-hour TV-series. This would have not mattered if the editor had done a better job, that is, focused on the important and got rid of the superfluous. Two hours would have been more than enough to tell the same story. Otherwise, you can still watch the whole series. I found the music overbearing and annoying, although some of the individual pieces are beautiful, but there is that choondah-choondah nyiiiiiiiiii-nyiiiiiii sort of sound all along the movie that got into my nerves. However, the music goes well with the histrionics of the characters and the craziness of the story. It is shocking that a society that seems to be so keen on partying and on celebrating, so musical, would end being at war and killing each others. Once upon a time, there was a country... and people who were happy being together without hating each other and killing each other. Underground is, despite the appearances, a very sad movie as speaks of social and human failure.

    "Underground" is an epic tale of absurdity directed by Emir Kusturica using the tragedy of his motherland, who used to be called Yugoslavia, as the backdrop of the film. The history of this country can be compared to a deep wound that still can't be healed up. The land has been tortured, invaded, raped in her soul by the circumstances of History, it's still bleeding yet people never stopped to sing, to dance, to love, to believe in a brighter future. Such a personal story, so deeply rooted in Kusturica's heart, could have been told in a sad, dark and quite depressing tone, but a sad movie, "Underground" is not. And a hilarious imaginative poignant comedy, it sure is. Emir Kusturica's Golden Palm Winner is a masterpiece of flamboyance, of decadence and non-stop dance ... a never-ending party that revisits the tragedy of History and translates it into an epic, romantic and frenetic comedy, so damn entertaining these isn't a single moment I didn't want to get up on the table and start to dance with a glass on my hand, to Goran Bergovic's incredible soundtrack. Indeed, this film is full of music, of energy, of emotions and transports us into a fantastic journey in the tragic History of Yugoslavia, following a chronological road : World War II, the Cold War and of course, the Modern War. This final act is depicted in a darker tone, to highlight the loss of every thing that made Yugoslavia, a land of hope, of optimism and fraternity. But, never letting war and death pushing our mood down, Kusturica ends the film in an apotheosis. A great finale for a great movie about life and hope, to keep a great smile in your face until the end ... which the film doesn't have, because there's less optimism with an ending than with the belief of a rebirth after the mutilation of a never-ending war. But "Underground" isn't a documentary about this war, or about Yugoslavia. Basically, it's the story of a love triangle and an evil scheme. It starts with two men, two friends : Marko, the sympathetic opportunistic intellectual and his best friend Blacky who's just joined the Party, Blacky is an electrician, a lovable naive buffoon with a warm heart and a head made of stone.

    The film opens with the following text: "One upon a time there was a country": from there, what is narrated is, in a fifty-year arch, the story of two Communists, Blacky and Marko, living in Yugoslavia: both of them are at first involved in weapon trafficking during WWII: but before the war ends, friends and family of Blacky (except for Marko) hide underground and start a new life in there. After the war, they are still convinced, thanks also to Marko, that WWII is still going on, while Marko on the other hand rises to fame becoming a well-known politician, and makes the people of his country believe Blacky was a hero that died in the war. The reason of Marko lying is so that he can exploit his disillusioned friends to make weapons, for him to profit. Harshly criticized by many politicians because of it's rough and stereotyped representation of Yugoslavians, and because of its seemingly hypocritical nature, (a film which satirizes the country and applauds it at the same time) Underground was however critically acclaimed by movie-lovers because of its originality and strong character: whether this film (and Kusturica) is universally beloved, that is debatable; the exaggerations, the humor, and the anti-realistic scenes are not for everybody, and tone down the entertainment of the overall picture for whoever isn't "getting it".

    Whatever the underlying symbolism to do with the breakup of Yugoslavia, this film is a true great. The casting is fantastic and the acting craps all over the garbage I see in the cinema. I could not help but love every character in this movie I don't care about the historical accuracy or political connotations (though I would maybe feel differently if I was from that part of the world), to me it's like a celebration of life and all the grief that comes with it. If you have partisan feelings I would simply advise you to shelve them and admire the art instead. Watch it.

    Underground is a Serbian-France-Germany movie directed by Emir Kusturica. It is an allegorical tragicomedy about Yugoslavia, which mixes elements of surrealism (some very Bu&ntilde;uel-ish moments there), comedy of the absurd, neorealism, and &eacute;poque drama to offer a satirical drama about Yugoslavia - a conglomerate of nations formed by people who have lived in war, against others or against each other, for almost a century. The movie is structured in three parts: War, Cold War, War. The first is devoted to the WW II, the second to Tito's period, and the third to the civil war that would end with the disintegration of Yugoslavia. The second part is the most interesting -and the one that gives the movie its title- as it shows in a metaphorical way how Yugoslavs related to each other, deceived each other, exploited each other, lied to each other, and how things were building up in their spirit during those years. All the characters are well drawn, and all the actors do a great job in their respective roles. The main characters are a couple of rascal friends and a always-in-heat actress. In fact, they cannot be taken straightforward as they are three human archetypes. Marko -played by Miki Manojlovic- is the sort of people who say they have political beliefs and that they are fighting for them, when, in fact, they are using the juncture to thrive personally, despite everything and everybody. Cmi = Blacky -played by Lazar Ristovski- depicts those people who truly believe in what they preach and act accordingly, no matter what; however, they are so obsessed with their beliefs that will end being blind to reality. Finally, Natalija -played by Mirjana Jokovic- depicts those people who will always support the political regime in power, and will change and move on as the scenario does, always thriving. The counterpoint to these three is Ivan -played by Slavko Stimacy- Marko's mentally changed brother, who loves his monkey Soni more than any human and wants to hung himself all the time as he's always deceived and betrayed by everybody. Although all the themes touched in the movie are, indeed, very serious and dramatic, Kusturica's merit is to present them in a farce, and to talk about his people showing his love-hatred feelings, his feeling that they were predetermined to end the way they did, while putting a smile in the viewer's face. Some scenes of the movie are unforgettable because they are surreal, funny, or shocking. My two favorite ones are both at the end of the movie. The scenes at the square of the old village are terrific, visually shocking, provocative and unforgettable. The end with the "island" really explains the whole movie and contains one of the most beautiful images of the same. Some of the scenes related to the marriage of Blacky's son, the first outing of the son to the real world, and the shooting of the movie about Blacky, are also great. Some Bosnians and French philosophers have accused the movie and Kusturica of being pro-Serbian and sending pro-Serbian messages in his movie. However, to me, Kusturica's movie is more an exercise of evaluation of the human traits of the people who amalgamated Yugoslavia, as a whole, as all of them are to blame for the disintegration of the Balkan country in a way or another. Of course, Kusturica considering himself a Serbian and Ortodox, despite being born Bosnian and Muslim, he does not mention anything about the barbaric acts committed by the Serbians. However, we see best friends killing each others... anybody who wants to understand, will. The movie rarely mentions any ethnic group. Going now to the downs of the movie, I thought the movie was extremely long, not engaging at times. At the same time, I thought the movie looked like a TV series re color, texture of the film, and use of the camera, a thing that I don't like seeing in a proper big screen movie. And, alas, it is an adaptation for the big screen of a 5-hour TV-series. This would have not mattered if the editor had done a better job, that is, focused on the important and got rid of the superfluous. Two hours would have been more than enough to tell the same story. Otherwise, you can still watch the whole series. I found the music overbearing and annoying, although some of the individual pieces are beautiful, but there is that choondah-choondah nyiiiiiiiiii-nyiiiiiii sort of sound all along the movie that got into my nerves. However, the music goes well with the histrionics of the characters and the craziness of the story. It is shocking that a society that seems to be so keen on partying and on celebrating, so musical, would end being at war and killing each others. Once upon a time, there was a country... and people who were happy being together without hating each other and killing each other. Underground is, despite the appearances, a very sad movie as speaks of social and human failure.

    "Underground" is an epic tale of absurdity directed by Emir Kusturica using the tragedy of his motherland, who used to be called Yugoslavia, as the backdrop of the film. The history of this country can be compared to a deep wound that still can't be healed up. The land has been tortured, invaded, raped in her soul by the circumstances of History, it's still bleeding yet people never stopped to sing, to dance, to love, to believe in a brighter future. Such a personal story, so deeply rooted in Kusturica's heart, could have been told in a sad, dark and quite depressing tone, but a sad movie, "Underground" is not. And a hilarious imaginative poignant comedy, it sure is. Emir Kusturica's Golden Palm Winner is a masterpiece of flamboyance, of decadence and non-stop dance ... a never-ending party that revisits the tragedy of History and translates it into an epic, romantic and frenetic comedy, so damn entertaining these isn't a single moment I didn't want to get up on the table and start to dance with a glass on my hand, to Goran Bergovic's incredible soundtrack. Indeed, this film is full of music, of energy, of emotions and transports us into a fantastic journey in the tragic History of Yugoslavia, following a chronological road : World War II, the Cold War and of course, the Modern War. This final act is depicted in a darker tone, to highlight the loss of every thing that made Yugoslavia, a land of hope, of optimism and fraternity. But, never letting war and death pushing our mood down, Kusturica ends the film in an apotheosis. A great finale for a great movie about life and hope, to keep a great smile in your face until the end ... which the film doesn't have, because there's less optimism with an ending than with the belief of a rebirth after the mutilation of a never-ending war. But "Underground" isn't a documentary about this war, or about Yugoslavia. Basically, it's the story of a love triangle and an evil scheme. It starts with two men, two friends : Marko, the sympathetic opportunistic intellectual and his best friend Blacky who's just joined the Party, Blacky is an electrician, a lovable naive buffoon with a warm heart and a head made of stone. Marko and Blacky are both members of the Communist Party and resistant fighters after the partial destruction of the country by the German invasion. Those men love to drink, to dance, and more than that, they love the same woman : the actress Natalja. Natalja is a young, pretty, ambitious woman with many lovers, a Nazi officer, Blacky, her future husband and Marko her future lover. They're all flawed, exuberant, yet always sympathetic. But the lyric soul of the film is Yvan, Marko's brother, an innocent zoo guardian with a stammer and who developed a strange relationship with a monkey, Soni. He loves his brother, he's sweet and tender, and maybe he believes in animals more than men whose cruelty touched him deep in the heart. He seems to be the only who cares for what happens and carries the tragedy in his pure heart. After liberating Blacky from the Germans, Marko hides him in the cave, "underground", until the war stops ... Then Marko, who's been previously struck by Natalja's beauty will elaborate one of the most evil schemes ever plotted in film, just to keep her. He'll make all the population who lived, who were born and grew up in the cave, participate to the War Effort by making weapons for the Resistance ... even after the Liberation when the Allies achieved to destroy what the Germans left. Ivan, hidden in the cave, doesn't know the War is over. Blacky doesn't know the Iron Curtrain is drawn now and he's a dead legend above the ground. He doesn't even know that his best friend, is very close to Tito, and a respectable member of the Party, married to Natalja, an acclaimed actress. Natalja drowns her guilt and her loss of innocence in alcohol, she's weak but she's already been ... Natalja is a beautiful girl flirting with the enemy, married to a man, and having a love affair with another. She and Marko are both opportunistic, they understand each other. She can't hate him because he "lies so well". It's not her fault, she can't control her seductive power. Natalja is like an allegory of a beautiful country invaded numerous times during history, a country that doesn't know where her heart belongs anymore. Blacky and the poor victims of Comrade Marko lived in a cave during the Communism years, did they really miss more than those who lived above the ground ? The scheme is so evil Marko has an accomplice who found a trick to make time go slower, like life in an oppressive time make it seem slower. A diabolical absurd scheme, but no more or no less than the reality ... what better alibi for absurdity than war? Hot or Cold? War is ABSURD enough to inspire such acts ... The story is simply a fascinating metaphor of the more serious tragic fate of Kusturica's bruised motherland. But despite this sadness, the movie is about hope, joy and optimism ... these are the happiest and most cheerful people you'll see in a film, even during War, even when they fight, even in a cave, living years and years without seeing the sunlight, don't prevent them from amusement, dances, laughs, plays and everything that makes life worth to live ... the movie is a big Prison you never want to escape from. It's thrilling to watch, it's an optimistic tale for a tragic story ... you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll laugh and laugh and shout and fight and dance and have an extraordinary cinematic experience .... So, comrades, just have a glass and join the "party" ... Opaaaaaaaa!

    Underground by Emir Kusturica is absolutely phenomenal. Blending 60 years of history, wars, politics, ideas, lies and tragedy into 170mins with, irony, vibrancy, music, life, poetry and beauty whilst still retaining a genuine optimism in the face of it all. Effortlessly. An entertaining dark comedy that weaves how generations of people get screwed over by the corruption of their politicians and their own friends out for selfish gain. So much density of politics and history compressed into such a personal story expressed through actual war footage, real political figures, self reflexivity, theatricality, music and a totally relentless narrative that isn't afraid to switch up from comedy to tragedy from one scene to the next without pandering to formulaic structure in an effort to satisfy an audience.

    Underground is a film that relates a story about an underground gun factory that is created after the German invasion to Yugoslavia. This factory is created by Marko (Miki Manojlovic) inside a basement, basing his power over the people inside by lies. He tells the workers that the war still going and they should keep on building guns to help the communist, even after the war was over. Blacky (Lazar Ritovski) who is Marko's right hand man inside the factory, due to an accident with a grenade gets put inside the factory with the same lie told by Marko, and becomes the figure inside the basement colony. There he follows the communist rule that everything should be done without selfishness to help the colony in general, assimilating a perfect communist colony. This movie reflects the two sides of a war in general; one where you have a leader who is only persuading power and on the other side, that gets trapped inside the basement, you have one fighting for ideals and to help what he considers perfection on his surroundings.
