    Irish screenwriter, producer and director Neil Jordan's ninth feature film which he wrote, is inspired by real events in the life of an Irish politician named Michael Collins. It premiered In competition at the 53rd Venice Film Festival in 1996, was shot on location in Ireland and is an Ireland-UK-France co-production which was produced by producer Stephen Woolley. It tells the story about a 26-year-old Irish man from County Cork, Ireland named Michael Collins. In late April 1916 during the First World War in the capital city of Ireland, Michael, his friend named Harry Boland, the president of Ireland named &Egrave;amon de Valera and other Irish republicans in the paramilitary group called the Irish Volunteers takes part in a rebellion against British rule called the Easter Rising and is arrested by the British Army. After two years of imprisonment in England, Michael and Harry returns to Dublin, Ireland where they soon realize that they are being tailed by the Brits. They reside with their common friend, whom they both have a romantic interest in, named Kitty Kiernan and Michael becomes the newly established IRA's Minister of intelligence. Distinctly and precisely directed by Irish filmmaker Neil Jordan, this finely paced and somewhat fictional tale which is narrated from multiple viewpoints though mostly from the main character's point of view, draws an engaging and multifaceted portrayal of a politician and prominent member of the Irish Republican Army and his relationship with his country, his best friend, the Irish president and a woman named Kitty. While notable for it's naturalistic and atmospheric milieu depictions, sterling cinematography by English cinematographer and director Chris Menges, production design by English production designer Anthony Pratt and costume design by British costume designer Sandy Powell, this character-driven and narrative-driven story about a complex 20th century leader who was a significant figure in the Irish War of Independence, in the negotiations between England and Ireland regarding the constitutional status of Northern Ireland and the following Irish Civil War between the Free Staters and the Republicans depicts an in-depth and humane study of character and contains a great score by composer Elliot Goldenthal. This biographical, conversational, romantic, at times humorous and literary period drama from the late 1990s which is set mostly in Ireland during the late 1910s and early 1920s and where an ongoing war between two neighbouring countries makes people divided in their relationship to their homeland, causes more death and ruin than solidarity and makes one of its most dedicated participants more aware of the importance of peace, is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent narrative structure, substantial character development, efficient continuity, colorful characters, use of music, rhythmic transitions between action scenes and dialog scenes, the words spoken by the president of the Irish Republic : "The Irish people established the Republic." and the poignant acting performances by Irish actor Liam Neeson, American actor Aidan Quinn, American actress Julia Roberts and English actor Alan Rickman. A dramatic, historic and heartfelt homage which gained, among other awards, the Golden Lion Neil Jordan and the Volpi Cup for Best Actor Liam Neeson at the 53rd Venice Film Festival in 1996.

    It's near impossible to be objective about political violence in Ireland but why when given the opportunity to make the definitive film about 20th century Ireland the film makers decide to shoot themselves in the foot ? Oh let me guess - this is financed by Americans for an American market What I hate about this film is it's pathetic attempt to be two sided . No one is shown to be an out and out villain even though extreme violence was frequently used by both sides. This maybe seen by some as being objective and two sided but strikes me as a cop out , and a cowardly one at that. I'd have no problem with the Brits being shown as the bad guys , they did commit atrocities in Ireland at this time , of that there's no dispute , but couldn't have the first half of the film concentrated on this more ? Likewise there was just as many violent atrocities committed by Irishmen on Irishmen following the creation of the Irish free state. Couldn't the second half have been far more brutal in showing De Valera to be a political opportunist only interested in power and using the lives of Irish patriots in order to get it ? Most unforgivable of all is the dilemma faced by the real life Collins of creating an independent Ireland without causing a war with the unionists in the North. Oh yes the majority of people in Northen Ireland want to remain British and a sizable minority would violently oppose a breakaway. Never once does this limp biopic point out that partition is the only optition Collins had to avert an Irish bloodbath. We see Collins going to meet the British government , then it cuts to the next scene a few months later where Collins returns to Dublin with a deal that has split Ireland in two. There is no exposition or explanation as to why Collins HAD TO negotiate partition. Instead Neil Jordan and Co decide it's a better idea making a film that concentrates on a love triangle. So what does this piece of Hollywood garbage actually tell us ? Only that Michael Collins called lots of people " Gobs**** " , that Alan Rickman can certainly act , that Julia Roberts and Aidan Quinn certainly can't , and that Stephan Rae would make a good James Bond

    An awful movie glorifying an evil terrorist. The IRA is exactly the same as al Queda and the Taliban, and Michael Collins was just an evil terrorist who murdered his own people using weapons and ammunition from the British. Ireland was never part of the British Empire, it was part of the UK and played a very active role in building the Empire. Westminster had passed the Home Rule Bill in 1914. Southern Ireland should have just waited for it to come into effect at the end of World War I, then declare itself a republic. In any case the film is ruined by the casting. Liam Neeson was clearly far too old to play Collins, who was only 31 when he died. Julia Roberts did the worst Irish accent I have ever heard and her character was completely irrelevant. Alan Rickman gave a thoroughly cartoonish portrayal of Eamon de Valera. I am so glad Collins was actually killed by one of his own terrorists. It is fitting that he got the violent death he deserved - just like his fellow mass murderers Osama bin Laden, Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi. Anybody from the United States who admired the IRA should remember that so-called white "Americans" were only British colonists planted in North America at the same time as the Scots in Ulster. 0/10.

    Liam Neeson dominates this biographical picture of the life of Michael Collins and the ultimate sacrifice he made to bring Ireland both freedom and peace. Freedom from the British Empire and peace to bring about some healing. Freedom they got, peace is still a dubious proposition in that country where they're still fighting the issues of the Reformation and Countereformation. The years covered are from 1916's Easter Rebellion until 1922 when Ireland was hip deep in a bloody civil war that ended only with exhaustion. Collins develops the strategy the prototype of urban guerrilla warfare. It's been used ever since in every part of the globe by whomever insurgents are. Having seen enough violence and caused enough of it Collins was sent by President Eamon DeValera as part of the negotiating team for a peace treaty. What they brought back was Dominion status for Ireland with the six Northern counties opting to remain in the British Empire and that King George V would be sovereign in Ireland. Collins saw it as a chance for the country to rest and heal with DeValera it was all or nothing. That split led to the civil war in Ireland far more bloody than the Rebellion as the casualties were 100% Irish. Playing DeValera is Alan Rickman and he fleshes out DeValera as the rather uptight manipulator of events and people that he was in real life. Julia Roberts who does not master an Irish brogue plays the woman in Collins's life whom he was going to marry. But casting Roberts was probably made strictly for box office. The details are fudged, but if you watch Michael Collins you'll get an idea from the film and from Neeson's performance of what the man was about and the sacrifice he made.

    Anyone interested in history especially that pertaining to how Ireland broke away from the United Kingdom and became it's own country definitely should check out this movie. Liam Neeson was born to play Michael Collins, can't think of any other actor who would've been appropriate to play this role. Aidan Quinn and Alan Rickman were both also great in their roles. Julia Roberts gets way too much hate for her role in this movie. She was perfectly fine in her role and if anyone else without the attention that she brings had been in that role it wouldn't have gotten all the negative reaction that it had gotten.

    "Michael Collins" is a great filmmaking achievement with a towering performance by Liam Neeson. So good was he that he should have at least been nominated for Best Actor. As stated above, it is tense and exciting, made all the more so by virtue of the fact that it is (nearly) historically accurate, a bloody, David vs Goliath-type saga of a rebellion by an oppressed people against a despotic foreign government. No quarrel with production values or photography, and acting is outstanding down to the smallest part. And then there is Julia Roberts. Miscast and without the wherewithal to overcome it, the picture throws out its anchor each time she is on screen. She accounts for at least 15-20 minutes of time wasted on a film which is of precarious length, leaving the viewer looking at his watch waiting for action to proceed. I imagine those in charge thought she would draw more people in to theaters but she almost has the opposite effect. That said, I don't think anything could spoil this tour de force by Neeson. I don't understand why the film was not more of a success when it was released, the drawback of Miss Roberts notwithstanding. Having an iron in the fire, I feel it is an important film as an historical document for those of us contributors who are of Irish descent.

    The true story of Michael Collins played by Academy Award Winner Liam Neeson was a wonderful recreation of an epic tale of a country longing for its freedom. and willing to go to great lengths to get it. Only one person stood in the way of their dream,and though he didn't know it at the time, the President of the IRB Eamon de Valera played by internationally acclaimed writer, actor, producer, and director Alan Rickman would soon come to weep for what he thought was right, and yet oh so wrong. A decision that would affect him the rest of his life. This movie was found to be exquisite in its insights, reenactments, as well as the roles that were played both by Lead Actor(s)/Actress(es), and the Supporting Actor(s)/Actress(es). The heart felt tears and fears and blood is felt even in the audience through all the pain and sufferings. This movie is up there as one of the best along side such movies as Shindler's list, and Chronicles of Narnia. It should also be noted that the movies that make a great impact on the feelings and emotions of the audience are those that take it to the heart from within the movie itself. That is why this movie by definition should receive nothing less than 10/10 stars, an Outstanding movie if ever I were to right of such.

    A collection of fairly big names (including Liam Neeson, Alan Rickman and Julia Roberts) joined together to offer this tribute to Michael Collins, one of the leaders of the movement for Irish independence and the chief negotiator of the controversial treaty that led to the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922, and who was ultimately assassinated during the resulting Irish Civil War. Neeson was superb in the role of Collins, convincingly showing his evolution from a radical who promoted violence and murder as a way of achieving the republic to his recognition that achieving his goals would have to be a part of an evolutionary process that would include the Irish Free State - an independent Ireland, but within the British Empire, and under the sovereignty of the English King. The treaty brought him into conflict with fellow republican leader Eamon de Valera (Rickman), who was critical of Collins' violent methods and seemed more interested in talking - both within and without Ireland - but who rejected the Free State and became a bitter opponent of Collins. This is hardly an uplifting movie, which I suppose makes it a fairly reasonable representation of the Irish history of the period (and of subsequent decades.) The first 75 minutes or so especially was a bit of a downer. That period of the movie features good performances and some helpful reflections on the history of the republican movement, but - much like Irish history itself - it becomes repetitively violent and bloody, as British kill Irish and Irish kill Irish and there seems to be little point to it all. That gets briefly set aside with the opening of negotiations with the British and the ultimate signing of and debate over the Free State treaty. Perhaps the most poignant line of the movie (to me) was when, during an argument over whether to accept the independent Free State or hold out for a republic, Collins says words to the effect of "I'm not going to kill over a matter of words" - making the point that The Free State had accomplished basically what the republicans wanted - Irish independence, with a republic left to be established through the normal process of political evolution. De Valera and his followers, though, refuse to accept that and restart the Civil War. This is certainly an interesting reflection not just on Ireland but on extremism of all kinds, and the natural desire of people to have everything they want right away and the resulting inability of many to compromise. I might add that Julia Roberts (as Kitty, who became engaged to Michael) seemed largely window dressing. Kitty's presence wasn't really necessary to the more important story of the political and paramilitary activities in Ireland and seemed to be more for the purpose of humanizing Michael Collins a bit. From the perspective of later Irish history, Collins' ultimate death seems so tragic, since within a few years De Valera chose to become active in the politics of the Free State (eventually even serving as Prime Minister of the Free State) and proved what Collins had said all along - that the Free State was part of an evolutionary movement that would lead to the establishment of the republic. Perhaps any movie dealing with virtually any part of Irish history has to be tragic to be honest.

    Actually way stronger than Ken Loach's rendering of the Irish Civil War - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460989/ Solid acting (might be candid at times but, hey, this is a genre movie), great rhythm throughout a 2-hour film, true-to-life dialogs (you do feel Neil Jordan was born in Sligo), impressive sets (how did they manage the Four Courts bombing?) All in all, a great movie: well-made, entertaining, that never stretches too far and leaves you thinking, as Michael Collins when in Dublin Castle during the transition ceremony: 'What's in a flag...' As I tend to like Neil Jordan's movies, and to have an interest in Irish history, I was a bit scared of being disappointed. Well, that did not happen.

The heart felt tears and fears and blood is felt even in the audience through all the pain and sufferings. This movie is up there as one of the best along side such movies as Shindler's list, and Chronicles of Narnia. It should also be noted that the movies that make a great impact on the feelings and emotions of the audience are those that take it to the heart from within the movie itself. That is why this movie by definition should receive nothing less than 10/10 stars, an Outstanding movie if ever I were to right of such.

    A collection of fairly big names (including Liam Neeson, Alan Rickman and Julia Roberts) joined together to offer this tribute to Michael Collins, one of the leaders of the movement for Irish independence and the chief negotiator of the controversial treaty that led to the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922, and who was ultimately assassinated during the resulting Irish Civil War. Neeson was superb in the role of Collins, convincingly showing his evolution from a radical who promoted violence and murder as a way of achieving the republic to his recognition that achieving his goals would have to be a part of an evolutionary process that would include the Irish Free State - an independent Ireland, but within the British Empire, and under the sovereignty of the English King. The treaty brought him into conflict with fellow republican leader Eamon de Valera (Rickman), who was critical of Collins' violent methods and seemed more interested in talking - both within and without Ireland - but who rejected the Free State and became a bitter opponent of Collins. This is hardly an uplifting movie, which I suppose makes it a fairly reasonable representation of the Irish history of the period (and of subsequent decades.) The first 75 minutes or so especially was a bit of a downer. That period of the movie features good performances and some helpful reflections on the history of the republican movement, but - much like Irish history itself - it becomes repetitively violent and bloody, as British kill Irish and Irish kill Irish and there seems to be little point to it all. That gets briefly set aside with the opening of negotiations with the British and the ultimate signing of and debate over the Free State treaty. Perhaps the most poignant line of the movie (to me) was when, during an argument over whether to accept the independent Free State or hold out for a republic, Collins says words to the effect of "I'm not going to kill over a matter of words" - making the point that The Free State had accomplished basically what the republicans wanted - Irish independence, with a republic left to be established through the normal process of political evolution. De Valera and his followers, though, refuse to accept that and restart the Civil War. This is certainly an interesting reflection not just on Ireland but on extremism of all kinds, and the natural desire of people to have everything they want right away and the resulting inability of many to compromise. I might add that Julia Roberts (as Kitty, who became engaged to Michael) seemed largely window dressing. Kitty's presence wasn't really necessary to the more important story of the political and paramilitary activities in Ireland and seemed to be more for the purpose of humanizing Michael Collins a bit. From the perspective of later Irish history, Collins' ultimate death seems so tragic, since within a few years De Valera chose to become active in the politics of the Free State (eventually even serving as Prime Minister of the Free State) and proved what Collins had said all along - that the Free State was part of an evolutionary movement that would lead to the establishment of the republic. Perhaps any movie dealing with virtually any part of Irish history has to be tragic to be honest.

    Actually way stronger than Ken Loach's rendering of the Irish Civil War - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460989/ Solid acting (might be candid at times but, hey, this is a genre movie), great rhythm throughout a 2-hour film, true-to-life dialogs (you do feel Neil Jordan was born in Sligo), impressive sets (how did they manage the Four Courts bombing?) All in all, a great movie: well-made, entertaining, that never stretches too far and leaves you thinking, as Michael Collins when in Dublin Castle during the transition ceremony: 'What's in a flag...' As I tend to like Neil Jordan's movies, and to have an interest in Irish history, I was a bit scared of being disappointed. Well, that did not happen.

    Irish screenwriter, producer and director Neil Jordan's ninth feature film which he wrote, is inspired by real events in the life of an Irish politician named Michael Collins. It premiered In competition at the 53rd Venice Film Festival in 1996, was shot on location in Ireland and is an Ireland-UK-France co-production which was produced by producer Stephen Woolley. It tells the story about a 26-year-old Irish man from County Cork, Ireland named Michael Collins. In late April 1916 during the First World War in the capital city of Ireland, Michael, his friend named Harry Boland, the president of Ireland named &Egrave;amon de Valera and other Irish republicans in the paramilitary group called the Irish Volunteers takes part in a rebellion against British rule called the Easter Rising and is arrested by the British Army. After two years of imprisonment in England, Michael and Harry returns to Dublin, Ireland where they soon realize that they are being tailed by the Brits. They reside with their common friend, whom they both have a romantic interest in, named Kitty Kiernan and Michael becomes the newly established IRA's Minister of intelligence. Distinctly and precisely directed by Irish filmmaker Neil Jordan, this finely paced and somewhat fictional tale which is narrated from multiple viewpoints though mostly from the main character's point of view, draws an engaging and multifaceted portrayal of a politician and prominent member of the Irish Republican Army and his relationship with his country, his best friend, the Irish president and a woman named Kitty. While notable for it's naturalistic and atmospheric milieu depictions, sterling cinematography by English cinematographer and director Chris Menges, production design by English production designer Anthony Pratt and costume design by British costume designer Sandy Powell, this character-driven and narrative-driven story about a complex 20th century leader who was a significant figure in the Irish War of Independence, in the negotiations between England and Ireland regarding the constitutional status of Northern Ireland and the following Irish Civil War between the Free Staters and the Republicans depicts an in-depth and humane study of character and contains a great score by composer Elliot Goldenthal. This biographical, conversational, romantic, at times humorous and literary period drama from the late 1990s which is set mostly in Ireland during the late 1910s and early 1920s and where an ongoing war between two neighbouring countries makes people divided in their relationship to their homeland, causes more death and ruin than solidarity and makes one of its most dedicated participants more aware of the importance of peace, is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent narrative structure, substantial character development, efficient continuity, colorful characters, use of music, rhythmic transitions between action scenes and dialog scenes, the words spoken by the president of the Irish Republic : "The Irish people established the Republic." and the poignant acting performances by Irish actor Liam Neeson, American actor Aidan Quinn, American actress Julia Roberts and English actor Alan Rickman. A dramatic, historic and heartfelt homage which gained, among other awards, the Golden Lion Neil Jordan and the Volpi Cup for Best Actor Liam Neeson at the 53rd Venice Film Festival in 1996.

    It's near impossible to be objective about political violence in Ireland but why when given the opportunity to make the definitive film about 20th century Ireland the film makers decide to shoot themselves in the foot ? Oh let me guess - this is financed by Americans for an American market What I hate about this film is it's pathetic attempt to be two sided . No one is shown to be an out and out villain even though extreme violence was frequently used by both sides. This maybe seen by some as being objective and two sided but strikes me as a cop out , and a cowardly one at that. I'd have no problem with the Brits being shown as the bad guys , they did commit atrocities in Ireland at this time , of that there's no dispute , but couldn't have the first half of the film concentrated on this more ? Likewise there was just as many violent atrocities committed by Irishmen on Irishmen following the creation of the Irish free state. Couldn't the second half have been far more brutal in showing De Valera to be a political opportunist only interested in power and using the lives of Irish patriots in order to get it ? Most unforgivable of all is the dilemma faced by the real life Collins of creating an independent Ireland without causing a war with the unionists in the North. Oh yes the majority of people in Northen Ireland want to remain British and a sizable minority would violently oppose a breakaway. Never once does this limp biopic point out that partition is the only optition Collins had to avert an Irish bloodbath. We see Collins going to meet the British government , then it cuts to the next scene a few months later where Collins returns to Dublin with a deal that has split Ireland in two. There is no exposition or explanation as to why Collins HAD TO negotiate partition. Instead Neil Jordan and Co decide it's a better idea making a film that concentrates on a love triangle. So what does this piece of Hollywood garbage actually tell us ? Only that Michael Collins called lots of people " Gobs**** " , that Alan Rickman can certainly act , that Julia Roberts and Aidan Quinn certainly can't , and that Stephan Rae would make a good James Bond

    An awful movie glorifying an evil terrorist. The IRA is exactly the same as al Queda and the Taliban, and Michael Collins was just an evil terrorist who murdered his own people using weapons and ammunition from the British. Ireland was never part of the British Empire, it was part of the UK and played a very active role in building the Empire. Westminster had passed the Home Rule Bill in 1914. Southern Ireland should have just waited for it to come into effect at the end of World War I, then declare itself a republic. In any case the film is ruined by the casting. Liam Neeson was clearly far too old to play Collins, who was only 31 when he died. Julia Roberts did the worst Irish accent I have ever heard and her character was completely irrelevant. Alan Rickman gave a thoroughly cartoonish portrayal of Eamon de Valera. I am so glad Collins was actually killed by one of his own terrorists. It is fitting that he got the violent death he deserved - just like his fellow mass murderers Osama bin Laden, Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi. Anybody from the United States who admired the IRA should remember that so-called white "Americans" were only British colonists planted in North America at the same time as the Scots in Ulster. 0/10.

    Liam Neeson dominates this biographical picture of the life of Michael Collins and the ultimate sacrifice he made to bring Ireland both freedom and peace. Freedom from the British Empire and peace to bring about some healing. Freedom they got, peace is still a dubious proposition in that country where they're still fighting the issues of the Reformation and Countereformation. The years covered are from 1916's Easter Rebellion until 1922 when Ireland was hip deep in a bloody civil war that ended only with exhaustion. Collins develops the strategy the prototype of urban guerrilla warfare. It's been used ever since in every part of the globe by whomever insurgents are. Having seen enough violence and caused enough of it Collins was sent by President Eamon DeValera as part of the negotiating team for a peace treaty. What they brought back was Dominion status for Ireland with the six Northern counties opting to remain in the British Empire and that King George V would be sovereign in Ireland. Collins saw it as a chance for the country to rest and heal with DeValera it was all or nothing. That split led to the civil war in Ireland far more bloody than the Rebellion as the casualties were 100% Irish. Playing DeValera is Alan Rickman and he fleshes out DeValera as the rather uptight manipulator of events and people that he was in real life. Julia Roberts who does not master an Irish brogue plays the woman in Collins's life whom he was going to marry. But casting Roberts was probably made strictly for box office. The details are fudged, but if you watch Michael Collins you'll get an idea from the film and from Neeson's performance of what the man was about and the sacrifice he made.

    Anyone interested in history especially that pertaining to how Ireland broke away from the United Kingdom and became it's own country definitely should check out this movie. Liam Neeson was born to play Michael Collins, can't think of any other actor who would've been appropriate to play this role. Aidan Quinn and Alan Rickman were both also great in their roles. Julia Roberts gets way too much hate for her role in this movie. She was perfectly fine in her role and if anyone else without the attention that she brings had been in that role it wouldn't have gotten all the negative reaction that it had gotten.

    "Michael Collins" is a great filmmaking achievement with a towering performance by Liam Neeson. So good was he that he should have at least been nominated for Best Actor. As stated above, it is tense and exciting, made all the more so by virtue of the fact that it is (nearly) historically accurate, a bloody, David vs Goliath-type saga of a rebellion by an oppressed people against a despotic foreign government. No quarrel with production values or photography, and acting is outstanding down to the smallest part. And then there is Julia Roberts. Miscast and without the wherewithal to overcome it, the picture throws out its anchor each time she is on screen. She accounts for at least 15-20 minutes of time wasted on a film which is of precarious length, leaving the viewer looking at his watch waiting for action to proceed. I imagine those in charge thought she would draw more people in to theaters but she almost has the opposite effect. That said, I don't think anything could spoil this tour de force by Neeson. I don't understand why the film was not more of a success when it was released, the drawback of Miss Roberts notwithstanding. Having an iron in the fire, I feel it is an important film as an historical document for those of us contributors who are of Irish descent.

    The true story of Michael Collins played by Academy Award Winner Liam Neeson was a wonderful recreation of an epic tale of a country longing for its freedom. and willing to go to great lengths to get it. Only one person stood in the way of their dream,and though he didn't know it at the time, the President of the IRB Eamon de Valera played by internationally acclaimed writer, actor, producer, and director Alan Rickman would soon come to weep for what he thought was right, and yet oh so wrong. A decision that would affect him the rest of his life. This movie was found to be exquisite in its insights, reenactments, as well as the roles that were played both by Lead Actor(s)/Actress(es), and the Supporting Actor(s)/Actress(es). The heart felt tears and fears and blood is felt even in the audience through all the pain and sufferings. This movie is up there as one of the best along side such movies as Shindler's list, and Chronicles of Narnia. It should also be noted that the movies that make a great impact on the feelings and emotions of the audience are those that take it to the heart from within the movie itself. That is why this movie by definition should receive nothing less than 10/10 stars, an Outstanding movie if ever I were to right of such.

Julia Roberts who does not master an Irish brogue plays the woman in Collins's life whom he was going to marry. But casting Roberts was probably made strictly for box office. The details are fudged, but if you watch Michael Collins you'll get an idea from the film and from Neeson's performance of what the man was about and the sacrifice he made.

    Anyone interested in history especially that pertaining to how Ireland broke away from the United Kingdom and became it's own country definitely should check out this movie. Liam Neeson was born to play Michael Collins, can't think of any other actor who would've been appropriate to play this role. Aidan Quinn and Alan Rickman were both also great in their roles. Julia Roberts gets way too much hate for her role in this movie. She was perfectly fine in her role and if anyone else without the attention that she brings had been in that role it wouldn't have gotten all the negative reaction that it had gotten.

    "Michael Collins" is a great filmmaking achievement with a towering performance by Liam Neeson. So good was he that he should have at least been nominated for Best Actor. As stated above, it is tense and exciting, made all the more so by virtue of the fact that it is (nearly) historically accurate, a bloody, David vs Goliath-type saga of a rebellion by an oppressed people against a despotic foreign government. No quarrel with production values or photography, and acting is outstanding down to the smallest part. And then there is Julia Roberts. Miscast and without the wherewithal to overcome it, the picture throws out its anchor each time she is on screen. She accounts for at least 15-20 minutes of time wasted on a film which is of precarious length, leaving the viewer looking at his watch waiting for action to proceed. I imagine those in charge thought she would draw more people in to theaters but she almost has the opposite effect. That said, I don't think anything could spoil this tour de force by Neeson. I don't understand why the film was not more of a success when it was released, the drawback of Miss Roberts notwithstanding. Having an iron in the fire, I feel it is an important film as an historical document for those of us contributors who are of Irish descent.

    The true story of Michael Collins played by Academy Award Winner Liam Neeson was a wonderful recreation of an epic tale of a country longing for its freedom. and willing to go to great lengths to get it. Only one person stood in the way of their dream,and though he didn't know it at the time, the President of the IRB Eamon de Valera played by internationally acclaimed writer, actor, producer, and director Alan Rickman would soon come to weep for what he thought was right, and yet oh so wrong. A decision that would affect him the rest of his life. This movie was found to be exquisite in its insights, reenactments, as well as the roles that were played both by Lead Actor(s)/Actress(es), and the Supporting Actor(s)/Actress(es). The heart felt tears and fears and blood is felt even in the audience through all the pain and sufferings. This movie is up there as one of the best along side such movies as Shindler's list, and Chronicles of Narnia. It should also be noted that the movies that make a great impact on the feelings and emotions of the audience are those that take it to the heart from within the movie itself. That is why this movie by definition should receive nothing less than 10/10 stars, an Outstanding movie if ever I were to right of such.

    A collection of fairly big names (including Liam Neeson, Alan Rickman and Julia Roberts) joined together to offer this tribute to Michael Collins, one of the leaders of the movement for Irish independence and the chief negotiator of the controversial treaty that led to the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922, and who was ultimately assassinated during the resulting Irish Civil War. Neeson was superb in the role of Collins, convincingly showing his evolution from a radical who promoted violence and murder as a way of achieving the republic to his recognition that achieving his goals would have to be a part of an evolutionary process that would include the Irish Free State - an independent Ireland, but within the British Empire, and under the sovereignty of the English King. The treaty brought him into conflict with fellow republican leader Eamon de Valera (Rickman), who was critical of Collins' violent methods and seemed more interested in talking - both within and without Ireland - but who rejected the Free State and became a bitter opponent of Collins. This is hardly an uplifting movie, which I suppose makes it a fairly reasonable representation of the Irish history of the period (and of subsequent decades.) The first 75 minutes or so especially was a bit of a downer. That period of the movie features good performances and some helpful reflections on the history of the republican movement, but - much like Irish history itself - it becomes repetitively violent and bloody, as British kill Irish and Irish kill Irish and there seems to be little point to it all. That gets briefly set aside with the opening of negotiations with the British and the ultimate signing of and debate over the Free State treaty. Perhaps the most poignant line of the movie (to me) was when, during an argument over whether to accept the independent Free State or hold out for a republic, Collins says words to the effect of "I'm not going to kill over a matter of words" - making the point that The Free State had accomplished basically what the republicans wanted - Irish independence, with a republic left to be established through the normal process of political evolution. De Valera and his followers, though, refuse to accept that and restart the Civil War. This is certainly an interesting reflection not just on Ireland but on extremism of all kinds, and the natural desire of people to have everything they want right away and the resulting inability of many to compromise. I might add that Julia Roberts (as Kitty, who became engaged to Michael) seemed largely window dressing. Kitty's presence wasn't really necessary to the more important story of the political and paramilitary activities in Ireland and seemed to be more for the purpose of humanizing Michael Collins a bit. From the perspective of later Irish history, Collins' ultimate death seems so tragic, since within a few years De Valera chose to become active in the politics of the Free State (eventually even serving as Prime Minister of the Free State) and proved what Collins had said all along - that the Free State was part of an evolutionary movement that would lead to the establishment of the republic. Perhaps any movie dealing with virtually any part of Irish history has to be tragic to be honest.

    Actually way stronger than Ken Loach's rendering of the Irish Civil War - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460989/ Solid acting (might be candid at times but, hey, this is a genre movie), great rhythm throughout a 2-hour film, true-to-life dialogs (you do feel Neil Jordan was born in Sligo), impressive sets (how did they manage the Four Courts bombing?) All in all, a great movie: well-made, entertaining, that never stretches too far and leaves you thinking, as Michael Collins when in Dublin Castle during the transition ceremony: 'What's in a flag...' As I tend to like Neil Jordan's movies, and to have an interest in Irish history, I was a bit scared of being disappointed. Well, that did not happen.

    Irish screenwriter, producer and director Neil Jordan's ninth feature film which he wrote, is inspired by real events in the life of an Irish politician named Michael Collins. It premiered In competition at the 53rd Venice Film Festival in 1996, was shot on location in Ireland and is an Ireland-UK-France co-production which was produced by producer Stephen Woolley. It tells the story about a 26-year-old Irish man from County Cork, Ireland named Michael Collins. In late April 1916 during the First World War in the capital city of Ireland, Michael, his friend named Harry Boland, the president of Ireland named &Egrave;amon de Valera and other Irish republicans in the paramilitary group called the Irish Volunteers takes part in a rebellion against British rule called the Easter Rising and is arrested by the British Army. After two years of imprisonment in England, Michael and Harry returns to Dublin, Ireland where they soon realize that they are being tailed by the Brits. They reside with their common friend, whom they both have a romantic interest in, named Kitty Kiernan and Michael becomes the newly established IRA's Minister of intelligence. Distinctly and precisely directed by Irish filmmaker Neil Jordan, this finely paced and somewhat fictional tale which is narrated from multiple viewpoints though mostly from the main character's point of view, draws an engaging and multifaceted portrayal of a politician and prominent member of the Irish Republican Army and his relationship with his country, his best friend, the Irish president and a woman named Kitty. While notable for it's naturalistic and atmospheric milieu depictions, sterling cinematography by English cinematographer and director Chris Menges, production design by English production designer Anthony Pratt and costume design by British costume designer Sandy Powell, this character-driven and narrative-driven story about a complex 20th century leader who was a significant figure in the Irish War of Independence, in the negotiations between England and Ireland regarding the constitutional status of Northern Ireland and the following Irish Civil War between the Free Staters and the Republicans depicts an in-depth and humane study of character and contains a great score by composer Elliot Goldenthal. This biographical, conversational, romantic, at times humorous and literary period drama from the late 1990s which is set mostly in Ireland during the late 1910s and early 1920s and where an ongoing war between two neighbouring countries makes people divided in their relationship to their homeland, causes more death and ruin than solidarity and makes one of its most dedicated participants more aware of the importance of peace, is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent narrative structure, substantial character development, efficient continuity, colorful characters, use of music, rhythmic transitions between action scenes and dialog scenes, the words spoken by the president of the Irish Republic : "The Irish people established the Republic." and the poignant acting performances by Irish actor Liam Neeson, American actor Aidan Quinn, American actress Julia Roberts and English actor Alan Rickman. A dramatic, historic and heartfelt homage which gained, among other awards, the Golden Lion Neil Jordan and the Volpi Cup for Best Actor Liam Neeson at the 53rd Venice Film Festival in 1996.

    It's near impossible to be objective about political violence in Ireland but why when given the opportunity to make the definitive film about 20th century Ireland the film makers decide to shoot themselves in the foot ? Oh let me guess - this is financed by Americans for an American market What I hate about this film is it's pathetic attempt to be two sided . No one is shown to be an out and out villain even though extreme violence was frequently used by both sides. This maybe seen by some as being objective and two sided but strikes me as a cop out , and a cowardly one at that. I'd have no problem with the Brits being shown as the bad guys , they did commit atrocities in Ireland at this time , of that there's no dispute , but couldn't have the first half of the film concentrated on this more ? Likewise there was just as many violent atrocities committed by Irishmen on Irishmen following the creation of the Irish free state. Couldn't the second half have been far more brutal in showing De Valera to be a political opportunist only interested in power and using the lives of Irish patriots in order to get it ? Most unforgivable of all is the dilemma faced by the real life Collins of creating an independent Ireland without causing a war with the unionists in the North. Oh yes the majority of people in Northen Ireland want to remain British and a sizable minority would violently oppose a breakaway. Never once does this limp biopic point out that partition is the only optition Collins had to avert an Irish bloodbath. We see Collins going to meet the British government , then it cuts to the next scene a few months later where Collins returns to Dublin with a deal that has split Ireland in two. There is no exposition or explanation as to why Collins HAD TO negotiate partition. Instead Neil Jordan and Co decide it's a better idea making a film that concentrates on a love triangle. So what does this piece of Hollywood garbage actually tell us ? Only that Michael Collins called lots of people " Gobs**** " , that Alan Rickman can certainly act , that Julia Roberts and Aidan Quinn certainly can't , and that Stephan Rae would make a good James Bond

    An awful movie glorifying an evil terrorist. The IRA is exactly the same as al Queda and the Taliban, and Michael Collins was just an evil terrorist who murdered his own people using weapons and ammunition from the British. Ireland was never part of the British Empire, it was part of the UK and played a very active role in building the Empire. Westminster had passed the Home Rule Bill in 1914. Southern Ireland should have just waited for it to come into effect at the end of World War I, then declare itself a republic. In any case the film is ruined by the casting. Liam Neeson was clearly far too old to play Collins, who was only 31 when he died. Julia Roberts did the worst Irish accent I have ever heard and her character was completely irrelevant. Alan Rickman gave a thoroughly cartoonish portrayal of Eamon de Valera. I am so glad Collins was actually killed by one of his own terrorists. It is fitting that he got the violent death he deserved - just like his fellow mass murderers Osama bin Laden, Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi. Anybody from the United States who admired the IRA should remember that so-called white "Americans" were only British colonists planted in North America at the same time as the Scots in Ulster. 0/10.

    Liam Neeson dominates this biographical picture of the life of Michael Collins and the ultimate sacrifice he made to bring Ireland both freedom and peace. Freedom from the British Empire and peace to bring about some healing. Freedom they got, peace is still a dubious proposition in that country where they're still fighting the issues of the Reformation and Countereformation. The years covered are from 1916's Easter Rebellion until 1922 when Ireland was hip deep in a bloody civil war that ended only with exhaustion. Collins develops the strategy the prototype of urban guerrilla warfare. It's been used ever since in every part of the globe by whomever insurgents are. Having seen enough violence and caused enough of it Collins was sent by President Eamon DeValera as part of the negotiating team for a peace treaty. What they brought back was Dominion status for Ireland with the six Northern counties opting to remain in the British Empire and that King George V would be sovereign in Ireland. Collins saw it as a chance for the country to rest and heal with DeValera it was all or nothing. That split led to the civil war in Ireland far more bloody than the Rebellion as the casualties were 100% Irish. Playing DeValera is Alan Rickman and he fleshes out DeValera as the rather uptight manipulator of events and people that he was in real life. Julia Roberts who does not master an Irish brogue plays the woman in Collins's life whom he was going to marry. But casting Roberts was probably made strictly for box office. The details are fudged, but if you watch Michael Collins you'll get an idea from the film and from Neeson's performance of what the man was about and the sacrifice he made.

Most unforgivable of all is the dilemma faced by the real life Collins of creating an independent Ireland without causing a war with the unionists in the North. Oh yes the majority of people in Northen Ireland want to remain British and a sizable minority would violently oppose a breakaway. Never once does this limp biopic point out that partition is the only optition Collins had to avert an Irish bloodbath. We see Collins going to meet the British government , then it cuts to the next scene a few months later where Collins returns to Dublin with a deal that has split Ireland in two. There is no exposition or explanation as to why Collins HAD TO negotiate partition. Instead Neil Jordan and Co decide it's a better idea making a film that concentrates on a love triangle. So what does this piece of Hollywood garbage actually tell us ? Only that Michael Collins called lots of people " Gobs**** " , that Alan Rickman can certainly act , that Julia Roberts and Aidan Quinn certainly can't , and that Stephan Rae would make a good James Bond

    An awful movie glorifying an evil terrorist. The IRA is exactly the same as al Queda and the Taliban, and Michael Collins was just an evil terrorist who murdered his own people using weapons and ammunition from the British. Ireland was never part of the British Empire, it was part of the UK and played a very active role in building the Empire. Westminster had passed the Home Rule Bill in 1914. Southern Ireland should have just waited for it to come into effect at the end of World War I, then declare itself a republic. In any case the film is ruined by the casting. Liam Neeson was clearly far too old to play Collins, who was only 31 when he died. Julia Roberts did the worst Irish accent I have ever heard and her character was completely irrelevant. Alan Rickman gave a thoroughly cartoonish portrayal of Eamon de Valera. I am so glad Collins was actually killed by one of his own terrorists. It is fitting that he got the violent death he deserved - just like his fellow mass murderers Osama bin Laden, Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi. Anybody from the United States who admired the IRA should remember that so-called white "Americans" were only British colonists planted in North America at the same time as the Scots in Ulster. 0/10.

    Liam Neeson dominates this biographical picture of the life of Michael Collins and the ultimate sacrifice he made to bring Ireland both freedom and peace. Freedom from the British Empire and peace to bring about some healing. Freedom they got, peace is still a dubious proposition in that country where they're still fighting the issues of the Reformation and Countereformation. The years covered are from 1916's Easter Rebellion until 1922 when Ireland was hip deep in a bloody civil war that ended only with exhaustion. Collins develops the strategy the prototype of urban guerrilla warfare. It's been used ever since in every part of the globe by whomever insurgents are. Having seen enough violence and caused enough of it Collins was sent by President Eamon DeValera as part of the negotiating team for a peace treaty. What they brought back was Dominion status for Ireland with the six Northern counties opting to remain in the British Empire and that King George V would be sovereign in Ireland. Collins saw it as a chance for the country to rest and heal with DeValera it was all or nothing. That split led to the civil war in Ireland far more bloody than the Rebellion as the casualties were 100% Irish. Playing DeValera is Alan Rickman and he fleshes out DeValera as the rather uptight manipulator of events and people that he was in real life. Julia Roberts who does not master an Irish brogue plays the woman in Collins's life whom he was going to marry. But casting Roberts was probably made strictly for box office. The details are fudged, but if you watch Michael Collins you'll get an idea from the film and from Neeson's performance of what the man was about and the sacrifice he made.

    Anyone interested in history especially that pertaining to how Ireland broke away from the United Kingdom and became it's own country definitely should check out this movie. Liam Neeson was born to play Michael Collins, can't think of any other actor who would've been appropriate to play this role. Aidan Quinn and Alan Rickman were both also great in their roles. Julia Roberts gets way too much hate for her role in this movie. She was perfectly fine in her role and if anyone else without the attention that she brings had been in that role it wouldn't have gotten all the negative reaction that it had gotten.

    "Michael Collins" is a great filmmaking achievement with a towering performance by Liam Neeson. So good was he that he should have at least been nominated for Best Actor. As stated above, it is tense and exciting, made all the more so by virtue of the fact that it is (nearly) historically accurate, a bloody, David vs Goliath-type saga of a rebellion by an oppressed people against a despotic foreign government. No quarrel with production values or photography, and acting is outstanding down to the smallest part. And then there is Julia Roberts. Miscast and without the wherewithal to overcome it, the picture throws out its anchor each time she is on screen. She accounts for at least 15-20 minutes of time wasted on a film which is of precarious length, leaving the viewer looking at his watch waiting for action to proceed. I imagine those in charge thought she would draw more people in to theaters but she almost has the opposite effect. That said, I don't think anything could spoil this tour de force by Neeson. I don't understand why the film was not more of a success when it was released, the drawback of Miss Roberts notwithstanding. Having an iron in the fire, I feel it is an important film as an historical document for those of us contributors who are of Irish descent.

    The true story of Michael Collins played by Academy Award Winner Liam Neeson was a wonderful recreation of an epic tale of a country longing for its freedom. and willing to go to great lengths to get it. Only one person stood in the way of their dream,and though he didn't know it at the time, the President of the IRB Eamon de Valera played by internationally acclaimed writer, actor, producer, and director Alan Rickman would soon come to weep for what he thought was right, and yet oh so wrong. A decision that would affect him the rest of his life. This movie was found to be exquisite in its insights, reenactments, as well as the roles that were played both by Lead Actor(s)/Actress(es), and the Supporting Actor(s)/Actress(es). The heart felt tears and fears and blood is felt even in the audience through all the pain and sufferings. This movie is up there as one of the best along side such movies as Shindler's list, and Chronicles of Narnia. It should also be noted that the movies that make a great impact on the feelings and emotions of the audience are those that take it to the heart from within the movie itself. That is why this movie by definition should receive nothing less than 10/10 stars, an Outstanding movie if ever I were to right of such.

    A collection of fairly big names (including Liam Neeson, Alan Rickman and Julia Roberts) joined together to offer this tribute to Michael Collins, one of the leaders of the movement for Irish independence and the chief negotiator of the controversial treaty that led to the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922, and who was ultimately assassinated during the resulting Irish Civil War. Neeson was superb in the role of Collins, convincingly showing his evolution from a radical who promoted violence and murder as a way of achieving the republic to his recognition that achieving his goals would have to be a part of an evolutionary process that would include the Irish Free State - an independent Ireland, but within the British Empire, and under the sovereignty of the English King. The treaty brought him into conflict with fellow republican leader Eamon de Valera (Rickman), who was critical of Collins' violent methods and seemed more interested in talking - both within and without Ireland - but who rejected the Free State and became a bitter opponent of Collins. This is hardly an uplifting movie, which I suppose makes it a fairly reasonable representation of the Irish history of the period (and of subsequent decades.) The first 75 minutes or so especially was a bit of a downer. That period of the movie features good performances and some helpful reflections on the history of the republican movement, but - much like Irish history itself - it becomes repetitively violent and bloody, as British kill Irish and Irish kill Irish and there seems to be little point to it all. That gets briefly set aside with the opening of negotiations with the British and the ultimate signing of and debate over the Free State treaty. Perhaps the most poignant line of the movie (to me) was when, during an argument over whether to accept the independent Free State or hold out for a republic, Collins says words to the effect of "I'm not going to kill over a matter of words" - making the point that The Free State had accomplished basically what the republicans wanted - Irish independence, with a republic left to be established through the normal process of political evolution. De Valera and his followers, though, refuse to accept that and restart the Civil War. This is certainly an interesting reflection not just on Ireland but on extremism of all kinds, and the natural desire of people to have everything they want right away and the resulting inability of many to compromise. I might add that Julia Roberts (as Kitty, who became engaged to Michael) seemed largely window dressing. Kitty's presence wasn't really necessary to the more important story of the political and paramilitary activities in Ireland and seemed to be more for the purpose of humanizing Michael Collins a bit. From the perspective of later Irish history, Collins' ultimate death seems so tragic, since within a few years De Valera chose to become active in the politics of the Free State (eventually even serving as Prime Minister of the Free State) and proved what Collins had said all along - that the Free State was part of an evolutionary movement that would lead to the establishment of the republic. Perhaps any movie dealing with virtually any part of Irish history has to be tragic to be honest.

    Actually way stronger than Ken Loach's rendering of the Irish Civil War - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460989/ Solid acting (might be candid at times but, hey, this is a genre movie), great rhythm throughout a 2-hour film, true-to-life dialogs (you do feel Neil Jordan was born in Sligo), impressive sets (how did they manage the Four Courts bombing?) All in all, a great movie: well-made, entertaining, that never stretches too far and leaves you thinking, as Michael Collins when in Dublin Castle during the transition ceremony: 'What's in a flag...' As I tend to like Neil Jordan's movies, and to have an interest in Irish history, I was a bit scared of being disappointed. Well, that did not happen.

    Irish screenwriter, producer and director Neil Jordan's ninth feature film which he wrote, is inspired by real events in the life of an Irish politician named Michael Collins. It premiered In competition at the 53rd Venice Film Festival in 1996, was shot on location in Ireland and is an Ireland-UK-France co-production which was produced by producer Stephen Woolley. It tells the story about a 26-year-old Irish man from County Cork, Ireland named Michael Collins. In late April 1916 during the First World War in the capital city of Ireland, Michael, his friend named Harry Boland, the president of Ireland named &Egrave;amon de Valera and other Irish republicans in the paramilitary group called the Irish Volunteers takes part in a rebellion against British rule called the Easter Rising and is arrested by the British Army. After two years of imprisonment in England, Michael and Harry returns to Dublin, Ireland where they soon realize that they are being tailed by the Brits. They reside with their common friend, whom they both have a romantic interest in, named Kitty Kiernan and Michael becomes the newly established IRA's Minister of intelligence. Distinctly and precisely directed by Irish filmmaker Neil Jordan, this finely paced and somewhat fictional tale which is narrated from multiple viewpoints though mostly from the main character's point of view, draws an engaging and multifaceted portrayal of a politician and prominent member of the Irish Republican Army and his relationship with his country, his best friend, the Irish president and a woman named Kitty. While notable for it's naturalistic and atmospheric milieu depictions, sterling cinematography by English cinematographer and director Chris Menges, production design by English production designer Anthony Pratt and costume design by British costume designer Sandy Powell, this character-driven and narrative-driven story about a complex 20th century leader who was a significant figure in the Irish War of Independence, in the negotiations between England and Ireland regarding the constitutional status of Northern Ireland and the following Irish Civil War between the Free Staters and the Republicans depicts an in-depth and humane study of character and contains a great score by composer Elliot Goldenthal. This biographical, conversational, romantic, at times humorous and literary period drama from the late 1990s which is set mostly in Ireland during the late 1910s and early 1920s and where an ongoing war between two neighbouring countries makes people divided in their relationship to their homeland, causes more death and ruin than solidarity and makes one of its most dedicated participants more aware of the importance of peace, is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent narrative structure, substantial character development, efficient continuity, colorful characters, use of music, rhythmic transitions between action scenes and dialog scenes, the words spoken by the president of the Irish Republic : "The Irish people established the Republic." and the poignant acting performances by Irish actor Liam Neeson, American actor Aidan Quinn, American actress Julia Roberts and English actor Alan Rickman. A dramatic, historic and heartfelt homage which gained, among other awards, the Golden Lion Neil Jordan and the Volpi Cup for Best Actor Liam Neeson at the 53rd Venice Film Festival in 1996.

    It's near impossible to be objective about political violence in Ireland but why when given the opportunity to make the definitive film about 20th century Ireland the film makers decide to shoot themselves in the foot ? Oh let me guess - this is financed by Americans for an American market What I hate about this film is it's pathetic attempt to be two sided . No one is shown to be an out and out villain even though extreme violence was frequently used by both sides. This maybe seen by some as being objective and two sided but strikes me as a cop out , and a cowardly one at that. I'd have no problem with the Brits being shown as the bad guys , they did commit atrocities in Ireland at this time , of that there's no dispute , but couldn't have the first half of the film concentrated on this more ? Likewise there was just as many violent atrocities committed by Irishmen on Irishmen following the creation of the Irish free state. Couldn't the second half have been far more brutal in showing De Valera to be a political opportunist only interested in power and using the lives of Irish patriots in order to get it ? Most unforgivable of all is the dilemma faced by the real life Collins of creating an independent Ireland without causing a war with the unionists in the North. Oh yes the majority of people in Northen Ireland want to remain British and a sizable minority would violently oppose a breakaway. Never once does this limp biopic point out that partition is the only optition Collins had to avert an Irish bloodbath.

So what does this piece of Hollywood garbage actually tell us ?

    Irish screenwriter, producer and director Neil Jordan's ninth feature film which he wrote, is inspired by real events in the life of an Irish politician named Michael Collins. It premiered In competition at the 53rd Venice Film Festival in 1996, was shot on location in Ireland and is an Ireland-UK-France co-production which was produced by producer Stephen Woolley. It tells the story about a 26-year-old Irish man from County Cork, Ireland named Michael Collins. In late April 1916 during the First World War in the capital city of Ireland, Michael, his friend named Harry Boland, the president of Ireland named &Egrave;amon de Valera and other Irish republicans in the paramilitary group called the Irish Volunteers takes part in a rebellion against British rule called the Easter Rising and is arrested by the British Army. After two years of imprisonment in England, Michael and Harry returns to Dublin, Ireland where they soon realize that they are being tailed by the Brits. They reside with their common friend, whom they both have a romantic interest in, named Kitty Kiernan and Michael becomes the newly established IRA's Minister of intelligence. Distinctly and precisely directed by Irish filmmaker Neil Jordan, this finely paced and somewhat fictional tale which is narrated from multiple viewpoints though mostly from the main character's point of view, draws an engaging and multifaceted portrayal of a politician and prominent member of the Irish Republican Army and his relationship with his country, his best friend, the Irish president and a woman named Kitty. While notable for it's naturalistic and atmospheric milieu depictions, sterling cinematography by English cinematographer and director Chris Menges, production design by English production designer Anthony Pratt and costume design by British costume designer Sandy Powell, this character-driven and narrative-driven story about a complex 20th century leader who was a significant figure in the Irish War of Independence, in the negotiations between England and Ireland regarding the constitutional status of Northern Ireland and the following Irish Civil War between the Free Staters and the Republicans depicts an in-depth and humane study of character and contains a great score by composer Elliot Goldenthal. This biographical, conversational, romantic, at times humorous and literary period drama from the late 1990s which is set mostly in Ireland during the late 1910s and early 1920s and where an ongoing war between two neighbouring countries makes people divided in their relationship to their homeland, causes more death and ruin than solidarity and makes one of its most dedicated participants more aware of the importance of peace, is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent narrative structure, substantial character development, efficient continuity, colorful characters, use of music, rhythmic transitions between action scenes and dialog scenes, the words spoken by the president of the Irish Republic : "The Irish people established the Republic." and the poignant acting performances by Irish actor Liam Neeson, American actor Aidan Quinn, American actress Julia Roberts and English actor Alan Rickman. A dramatic, historic and heartfelt homage which gained, among other awards, the Golden Lion Neil Jordan and the Volpi Cup for Best Actor Liam Neeson at the 53rd Venice Film Festival in 1996.

    It's near impossible to be objective about political violence in Ireland but why when given the opportunity to make the definitive film about 20th century Ireland the film makers decide to shoot themselves in the foot ? Oh let me guess - this is financed by Americans for an American market What I hate about this film is it's pathetic attempt to be two sided . No one is shown to be an out and out villain even though extreme violence was frequently used by both sides. This maybe seen by some as being objective and two sided but strikes me as a cop out , and a cowardly one at that. I'd have no problem with the Brits being shown as the bad guys , they did commit atrocities in Ireland at this time , of that there's no dispute , but couldn't have the first half of the film concentrated on this more ? Likewise there was just as many violent atrocities committed by Irishmen on Irishmen following the creation of the Irish free state. Couldn't the second half have been far more brutal in showing De Valera to be a political opportunist only interested in power and using the lives of Irish patriots in order to get it ? Most unforgivable of all is the dilemma faced by the real life Collins of creating an independent Ireland without causing a war with the unionists in the North. Oh yes the majority of people in Northen Ireland want to remain British and a sizable minority would violently oppose a breakaway. Never once does this limp biopic point out that partition is the only optition Collins had to avert an Irish bloodbath. We see Collins going to meet the British government , then it cuts to the next scene a few months later where Collins returns to Dublin with a deal that has split Ireland in two. There is no exposition or explanation as to why Collins HAD TO negotiate partition. Instead Neil Jordan and Co decide it's a better idea making a film that concentrates on a love triangle. So what does this piece of Hollywood garbage actually tell us ? Only that Michael Collins called lots of people " Gobs**** " , that Alan Rickman can certainly act , that Julia Roberts and Aidan Quinn certainly can't , and that Stephan Rae would make a good James Bond

    An awful movie glorifying an evil terrorist. The IRA is exactly the same as al Queda and the Taliban, and Michael Collins was just an evil terrorist who murdered his own people using weapons and ammunition from the British. Ireland was never part of the British Empire, it was part of the UK and played a very active role in building the Empire. Westminster had passed the Home Rule Bill in 1914. Southern Ireland should have just waited for it to come into effect at the end of World War I, then declare itself a republic. In any case the film is ruined by the casting. Liam Neeson was clearly far too old to play Collins, who was only 31 when he died. Julia Roberts did the worst Irish accent I have ever heard and her character was completely irrelevant. Alan Rickman gave a thoroughly cartoonish portrayal of Eamon de Valera. I am so glad Collins was actually killed by one of his own terrorists. It is fitting that he got the violent death he deserved - just like his fellow mass murderers Osama bin Laden, Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi. Anybody from the United States who admired the IRA should remember that so-called white "Americans" were only British colonists planted in North America at the same time as the Scots in Ulster. 0/10.

    Liam Neeson dominates this biographical picture of the life of Michael Collins and the ultimate sacrifice he made to bring Ireland both freedom and peace. Freedom from the British Empire and peace to bring about some healing. Freedom they got, peace is still a dubious proposition in that country where they're still fighting the issues of the Reformation and Countereformation. The years covered are from 1916's Easter Rebellion until 1922 when Ireland was hip deep in a bloody civil war that ended only with exhaustion. Collins develops the strategy the prototype of urban guerrilla warfare. It's been used ever since in every part of the globe by whomever insurgents are. Having seen enough violence and caused enough of it Collins was sent by President Eamon DeValera as part of the negotiating team for a peace treaty. What they brought back was Dominion status for Ireland with the six Northern counties opting to remain in the British Empire and that King George V would be sovereign in Ireland. Collins saw it as a chance for the country to rest and heal with DeValera it was all or nothing. That split led to the civil war in Ireland far more bloody than the Rebellion as the casualties were 100% Irish. Playing DeValera is Alan Rickman and he fleshes out DeValera as the rather uptight manipulator of events and people that he was in real life. Julia Roberts who does not master an Irish brogue plays the woman in Collins's life whom he was going to marry. But casting Roberts was probably made strictly for box office. The details are fudged, but if you watch Michael Collins you'll get an idea from the film and from Neeson's performance of what the man was about and the sacrifice he made.

    Anyone interested in history especially that pertaining to how Ireland broke away from the United Kingdom and became it's own country definitely should check out this movie. Liam Neeson was born to play Michael Collins, can't think of any other actor who would've been appropriate to play this role. Aidan Quinn and Alan Rickman were both also great in their roles. Julia Roberts gets way too much hate for her role in this movie. She was perfectly fine in her role and if anyone else without the attention that she brings had been in that role it wouldn't have gotten all the negative reaction that it had gotten.

    "Michael Collins" is a great filmmaking achievement with a towering performance by Liam Neeson. So good was he that he should have at least been nominated for Best Actor. As stated above, it is tense and exciting, made all the more so by virtue of the fact that it is (nearly) historically accurate, a bloody, David vs Goliath-type saga of a rebellion by an oppressed people against a despotic foreign government. No quarrel with production values or photography, and acting is outstanding down to the smallest part. And then there is Julia Roberts. Miscast and without the wherewithal to overcome it, the picture throws out its anchor each time she is on screen. She accounts for at least 15-20 minutes of time wasted on a film which is of precarious length, leaving the viewer looking at his watch waiting for action to proceed. I imagine those in charge thought she would draw more people in to theaters but she almost has the opposite effect. That said, I don't think anything could spoil this tour de force by Neeson. I don't understand why the film was not more of a success when it was released, the drawback of Miss Roberts notwithstanding. Having an iron in the fire, I feel it is an important film as an historical document for those of us contributors who are of Irish descent.

    The true story of Michael Collins played by Academy Award Winner Liam Neeson was a wonderful recreation of an epic tale of a country longing for its freedom. and willing to go to great lengths to get it. Only one person stood in the way of their dream,and though he didn't know it at the time, the President of the IRB Eamon de Valera played by internationally acclaimed writer, actor, producer, and director Alan Rickman would soon come to weep for what he thought was right, and yet oh so wrong. A decision that would affect him the rest of his life. This movie was found to be exquisite in its insights, reenactments, as well as the roles that were played both by Lead Actor(s)/Actress(es), and the Supporting Actor(s)/Actress(es). The heart felt tears and fears and blood is felt even in the audience through all the pain and sufferings. This movie is up there as one of the best along side such movies as Shindler's list, and Chronicles of Narnia. It should also be noted that the movies that make a great impact on the feelings and emotions of the audience are those that take it to the heart from within the movie itself. That is why this movie by definition should receive nothing less than 10/10 stars, an Outstanding movie if ever I were to right of such.

    A collection of fairly big names (including Liam Neeson, Alan Rickman and Julia Roberts) joined together to offer this tribute to Michael Collins, one of the leaders of the movement for Irish independence and the chief negotiator of the controversial treaty that led to the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922, and who was ultimately assassinated during the resulting Irish Civil War. Neeson was superb in the role of Collins, convincingly showing his evolution from a radical who promoted violence and murder as a way of achieving the republic to his recognition that achieving his goals would have to be a part of an evolutionary process that would include the Irish Free State - an independent Ireland, but within the British Empire, and under the sovereignty of the English King. The treaty brought him into conflict with fellow republican leader Eamon de Valera (Rickman), who was critical of Collins' violent methods and seemed more interested in talking - both within and without Ireland - but who rejected the Free State and became a bitter opponent of Collins. This is hardly an uplifting movie, which I suppose makes it a fairly reasonable representation of the Irish history of the period (and of subsequent decades.) The first 75 minutes or so especially was a bit of a downer. That period of the movie features good performances and some helpful reflections on the history of the republican movement, but - much like Irish history itself - it becomes repetitively violent and bloody, as British kill Irish and Irish kill Irish and there seems to be little point to it all. That gets briefly set aside with the opening of negotiations with the British and the ultimate signing of and debate over the Free State treaty. Perhaps the most poignant line of the movie (to me) was when, during an argument over whether to accept the independent Free State or hold out for a republic, Collins says words to the effect of "I'm not going to kill over a matter of words" - making the point that The Free State had accomplished basically what the republicans wanted - Irish independence, with a republic left to be established through the normal process of political evolution. De Valera and his followers, though, refuse to accept that and restart the Civil War. This is certainly an interesting reflection not just on Ireland but on extremism of all kinds, and the natural desire of people to have everything they want right away and the resulting inability of many to compromise. I might add that Julia Roberts (as Kitty, who became engaged to Michael) seemed largely window dressing. Kitty's presence wasn't really necessary to the more important story of the political and paramilitary activities in Ireland and seemed to be more for the purpose of humanizing Michael Collins a bit. From the perspective of later Irish history, Collins' ultimate death seems so tragic, since within a few years De Valera chose to become active in the politics of the Free State (eventually even serving as Prime Minister of the Free State) and proved what Collins had said all along - that the Free State was part of an evolutionary movement that would lead to the establishment of the republic. Perhaps any movie dealing with virtually any part of Irish history has to be tragic to be honest.

    Actually way stronger than Ken Loach's rendering of the Irish Civil War - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460989/ Solid acting (might be candid at times but, hey, this is a genre movie), great rhythm throughout a 2-hour film, true-to-life dialogs (you do feel Neil Jordan was born in Sligo), impressive sets (how did they manage the Four Courts bombing?) All in all, a great movie: well-made, entertaining, that never stretches too far and leaves you thinking, as Michael Collins when in Dublin Castle during the transition ceremony: 'What's in a flag...' As I tend to like Neil Jordan's movies, and to have an interest in Irish history, I was a bit scared of being disappointed. Well, that did not happen.

Perhaps the most poignant line of the movie (to me) was when, during an argument over whether to accept the independent Free State or hold out for a republic, Collins says words to the effect of "I'm not going to kill over a matter of words" - making the point that The Free State had accomplished basically what the republicans wanted - Irish independence, with a republic left to be established through the normal process of political evolution. De Valera and his followers, though, refuse to accept that and restart the Civil War. This is certainly an interesting reflection not just on Ireland but on extremism of all kinds, and the natural desire of people to have everything they want right away and the resulting inability of many to compromise. I might add that Julia Roberts (as Kitty, who became engaged to Michael) seemed largely window dressing. Kitty's presence wasn't really necessary to the more important story of the political and paramilitary activities in Ireland and seemed to be more for the purpose of humanizing Michael Collins a bit. From the perspective of later Irish history, Collins' ultimate death seems so tragic, since within a few years De Valera chose to become active in the politics of the Free State (eventually even serving as Prime Minister of the Free State) and proved what Collins had said all along - that the Free State was part of an evolutionary movement that would lead to the establishment of the republic. Perhaps any movie dealing with virtually any part of Irish history has to be tragic to be honest.

    Actually way stronger than Ken Loach's rendering of the Irish Civil War - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460989/ Solid acting (might be candid at times but, hey, this is a genre movie), great rhythm throughout a 2-hour film, true-to-life dialogs (you do feel Neil Jordan was born in Sligo), impressive sets (how did they manage the Four Courts bombing?) All in all, a great movie: well-made, entertaining, that never stretches too far and leaves you thinking, as Michael Collins when in Dublin Castle during the transition ceremony: 'What's in a flag...' As I tend to like Neil Jordan's movies, and to have an interest in Irish history, I was a bit scared of being disappointed. Well, that did not happen.
