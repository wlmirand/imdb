 <sinopse>
  A mysterious device designed to provide its owner with eternal life resurfaces after four hundred years, leaving a trail of destruction in its path.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  In 1535, an alchemist builds an extraordinary mechanism encapsulated into a small golden device. The invention, designed to convey eternal life to its owner, survives its maker until 1997, when it shows up with an antiques dealer. Fascinated with the strange device, Gris (Luppi) doesn't note that there's more than one person looking for it. The promise of eternal life has become an obsession for old and sick Mr. De la Guardia (Brook). He and his nephew (Perlman) will do anything to get the Chronos Invention.

    In 1535, an alchemist builds the cronos device, which allows for extended lifetimes. Four hundred years later, the alchemist is killed. His belongings go on public auction, and the cronos device attains anonymity. The film is about the attempts of a rich, ill man, who is obsessed with eternal life, to obtain the cronos device. Cinematography: 9/10 Good. Sound: 9/10 Adequate, but with occasional overwrought incidental music. Acting: 10/10 Fine acting by the five leads. Screenplay: 10/10 Exceptional. The director's touch is evident even in this first effort. Motivation, exposition of consequences, and logical flow of events were right on the money. The ends that the characters meet fit their personalities, which was a nice touch, and one frequently omitted in more current films.

    I am becoming more and more impressed with Guillermo Del Toro's work. I found Hellboy to be a great comic book movie and Hellboy 2 to be everything I am looking for in a superhero movie. Pan's Labyrinth was a classic, great fantasy storytelling. Blade 2, although my least favourite of the Blade series was very entertaining and provided great emotional attachment to the characters. I found this in a shop today and I simply could not let it go. Knowing his other stuff I wanted to see his first full-length movie. The plot is that in the 15th Century an Alchemist builds a beetle that emits a parasite into human flesh that makes them live longer, but also having a harshness to sunlight and a strange thirst for human blood - it's called Cronos. In a modern day Mexico an antique store owner (Frederico Luppi) and his granddaughter find out that an angel relic was hollow and inside is the Cronos and infects the antique store owner. Meanwhile an old rich man and his nephew (Ron Perlman) stop at nothing to find the Cronos device. Guillermo Del Toro is quickly becoming one of my favourite directors now. I did enjoy the imaginative spin on a rather tired out concept (well maybe not back 20 years ago but look at things now!). I did enjoy the acting from Frederico Luppi. If you are a fan of Del Toro (or knows what kind of movies he makes) then this is definitely worth a watch. It isn't as good as Hellboy 2 or Pan's Labyrinth (his masterpieces!) but it is enjoyable.

    Very recently, this viewer watched, for the first time, the 1958 Mexican film "The Vampire's Coffin," in which the Count Lavud--a bloodsucker very much in the traditional, uh, vein--returns to continue his nocturnal depredations. And just last night, for the first time also, I watched another Mexican film dealing with a man who has a decided thirst for blood, Guillermo del Toro's first film as a director, 1993's "Cronos." This latter picture, however, coming 35 years after the other, is anything BUT a traditional vampire tale, and reveals del Toro to be a masterful filmmaker, and a consummate craftsman. Both written and directed by del Toro, "Cronos" must be added to the list of such Great First Horror Films By A Novice Director as Mario Bava's "Black Sunday," George A. Romero's "Night of the Living Dead" and Dario Argento's "The Bird With the Crystal Plumage"; it may not be as seminal a film as any of those earlier three, but it yet bursts with the same manifest imaginative glee and sheer joy of filmmaking; the work of a first-time director anxious to show the world what he is capable of, and succeeding wildly. Unlike the American sci-fi film "Kronos" (1957), which told of an energy-draining alien contraption, "Cronos" tells of a gizmo of a very different nature. In the picture's ubercreepy and fascinating intro, the viewer learns that the Cronos device was constructed by a Spanish alchemist, Uberto Fulcanelli, in 1536; a golden, scarab-shaped construction containing moving gears and a living insect, the device can sprout spiderlike appendages and insert a stinger into its owner, conferring the gift of eternal life. Flash forward 450 years or so, and we meet a kindly, aging antique-store owner, Jesus Gris (Gray Jesus, in other words, and played by Argentinean actor Federico Luppi, who would go on to appear in the del Toro films "The Devil's Backbone" and "Pan's Labyrinth"), who lives with his wife Mercedes (Margarita Isabel) and his strange little granddaughter, Aurora (the remarkable child actress Tamara Shanath). Jesus' antique shop is very much an upscale one--not at all like the Temptations Ltd. emporium that Peter Cushing presides over in 1973's "From Beyond the Grave," to say the least--and, to be succinct, he one day discovers the ancient Cronos device hidden in the base of an archangel statue. Jesus is very quickly affected by the gizmo and is soon afflicted with a taste for blood. Meanwhile, his already tough predicament worsens when thuggish goon Angel (Ron Perlman, who himself would go on to appear in the del Toro films "Blade 2," "Hellboy" and its sequel), emissary and nephew of dying millionaire De la Guardia (Claudio Brook), starts to get decidedly violent in his own search for the Cronos device.... Strangely enough, the film that "Cronos" most brought to mind, as I watched it, was none other than the 1973 American film "Ganja and Hess." In both pictures, a decent man is pierced by an ancient artifact (the dagger of Myrthia, in the earlier film) and becomes a vampire of sorts, although the "V word" is never mentioned in either film; in both films, our transformed man ("Night of the Living Dead"'s Duane Jones, in the earlier picture) is shown daintily and disgustingly lapping up blood off of a floor! But that is pretty much where the similarity ends, and while "Ganja and Hess" is painfully slow moving and even managed the near-impossible task of putting me to sleep (the only film to ever accomplish this!), "Cronos" is at once compact, fast moving, suspenseful, colorful and exciting. It is also filled with all sorts of imaginative and oddball touches, such as Angel's nose fetish, a side trip to a very strange mortician's workshop, and those jars of (his very own) preserved organs that De la Guardia keeps on display. And speaking of oddball, the Aurora character is a very strange one indeed, a nearly mute little girl (I believe she speaks but a single word during the course of the entire film) whose unwavering love of and support for her grandfather--despite the horrible transformations he undergoes--are very much the sweet soul of this ultimately touching film. We care not a whit for the two central characters of "Ganja and Hess," but get very much emotionally invested in the welfare of both Jesus and Aurora. In all, this is a wonderfully self-assured debut for a tyro filmmaker; as del Toro himself puts it, with typical humor and self-deprecation, in one of this DVD's many interview extras, it was "made with absolute, mad, fat-man passion and put out to the world with sincerity and brutal honesty." Happily, that passion is clearly evident throughout this marvelous film. One final word concerning this DVD itself. It is a Criterion DVD, and I suppose that alone should testify as to its quality and generous content. Extras include interviews with del Toro, Perlman, Luppi and cinematographer Guillermo Navarro (who, incidentally, does a wonderful job here, and who would go on to win an Oscar for his work on "Pan's Labyrinth"), as well as del Toro's first short film, 1987's "Geometria," AND a tour of del Toro's office/house/museum, Bleak House. This abode contains hundreds and hundreds of rare books, film collectibles and sundry horror/fantasy pieces, and with any justice will one day be open to the public via paid admission. A most impressive collection, from a man whose love for film seems virtually boundless....

    Since we were little we heard tales of wizards, alchemists and different substances which have the power to give eternal life ... the director Guillermo del Toro invites us to make a journey into these stories through his film "Cronos" (1993, Mexico), which is his first film. The antiques dealer, Jesus Gris (Federico Luppi) discovers a strange device capable of giving its wearer eternal life ... that's the story that is told in a linear fashion. It is a strong story about ambition, power and character because throughout the film we see the protagonist struggle with himself unable to resist this "drug" that slowly consumes him. The funny thing is that he is not a person who wants to live forever, but he wants to live as long as necessary to fulfill your goals. With this film we begin to distinguish the style that del Toro will explode later in films like "Pan's Labyrinth" (2006, Spain, Mexico, USA), we see everything in a dark "mood" with religious signs and with a child who connects people with the world of fiction. It's a film that has some plot holes, start telling us a story that engages by itself, but it seems that slowly decays as the film progresses and costs spinning certain things, as there are details that presents which didn't have logical explanation and come to seem a bit absurd. It has an ending that is not predictable, but that is not surprising and is loose enough. It is a story of magical realism that becomes a strange variant of vampire movies told in a somewhat cold and graphic fashion, which can sometimes be grotesque, but all the mystery that surrounds it is what makes that the spectator can't stop seeing it, although it does not have enough characters empathetic and some are very gray. &nbsp;The script is pretty weak (lacking strength), draws attention because of what we want to see, but how has it ends up leaving you wanting more.

    This is not your typical vampire movie. It's a stylistic, beautiful portrayal of the love between a grandfather and his granddaughter. It does new things with the vampire myth and it is the most touching Gothic love story. You can feel that this was a movie made by a man with an explosive imagination and a lot of heart put into what he was making. It is an intelligent and thought provoking film that shows vampires in a different light. This is certainly a great first film that leads into a great career for Guillermo Del Toro. Whether it's foreign films, or mainstream American Hollywood, Del Toro projects visions on the screen of unbelievable creativity and his stories are always sprinkled with a little bit of his childhood.

    This movie reminded me again and again of that cartoon with the vampire and the little girl, where the vampire would not kill the child and the child would not let the vampire go before having a zillion tea parties and tucking her to bed. Of course, the film is a lot richer, full of symbolism, but at the same time maintaining a simplicity that is both refreshing and easy to relate to. The story is OK, but more than that is the Latin American feel of it all and the mix of old music (and people) with a horror theme. Guilermo del Toro was a rookie at that time, but he made a beautiful film, together with long time collaborators Ron Perlman and Federico Luppi. Bottom line: the movie was a little slow paced and the main character both strong and weak in such a human way that it is impossible to not relate to him. The movie is clearly an experiment, as well, filled with great scenes and peppered with strangely unprofessional ones. But it works, it has it's own mood and feel and I recommend it to any horror fan out there.

    In a bid to cheat death, terminally ill millionaire De la Guardia (Claudio Brook) instructs his ruthless nephew Angel (Ron Perlman) to locate The Cronos, a mystical clockwork contraption with the power to bestow immortality on its user. Angel eventually locates the device in the possession of kindly antiques dealer Jesus (Federico Luppi), and resorts to murder to get his hands on the prize; however, having already activated the device, the old man doesn't stay dead for long. With a hunger for blood, an aversion to sunlight, and a rather manky complexion, Jesus breaks into the la Guardia home looking for answers to his bizarre condition. Cronos, the debut movie from Guillermo del Toro, is listed on IMDb as a horror, but it would be much better described as a dark fairytale: although a form of vampirism is at the heart of his script, the writer/director's focus is on Jesus's gradually evolving relationship with his young granddaughter Aurora (Tamara Shanath) and the realisation of a surreal/Gothic fantasy aesthetic. While I don't particularly mind the movie's considered pacinga slow-burn narrative does not faze me one bitand the rich shadowy cinematography is often impressive, I do tend to struggle with the self-consciously quirky, quasi-art-house approach of the type favoured by film-makers such as Jeunet et Caro and Terry Gilliam, finding it all too affected and ostentatious for my taste. Del Toro's style isn't anywhere near as excessive as those particular film-makers can be when they really put their minds to it, but it does result in just enough awkward moments, over-sentimentality and irritating calculated whimsicality to prevent it from being a wholly digestible affair (the dreadfully inappropriate score and the 'comical' mortician being perhaps the film's most notable weaknesses). 5.5/10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb.

    i didn't think this film was as good as del Toro's 'The Devil's Backbone', but it was one of the director's first and it's still scary, disturbing and memorable twenty years later. this film, though produced modestly in Mexico, signals the strong visionary style that del Toro was to eventually become known for. even though made in the 1990's 'Cronos' has the look and feel of horror films from the 1970's and late 60's. most notably the film's of Mario Bava. 'Cronos' is still memorable today because of it's handsome photography and stylish look which elevate it from other low budget horror films from the 90's or any period really. very few horror films look this good or are supplied with this kind of elegance and intelligence. it also still has the ability to scare on a dark night. maybe not as good as the intense 'Devil's Backbone', but still a horror film with more merits than many from the genre in the 90's.

    Guillermo del Toro directed and wrote Cronos, a horror tale which begins in the 1500s with a scientist inventing a device which gives eternal life. A man in current times, Jesus, discovers the magical machine a statue of an archangel. After winding it up, it awakens, grabs him and injects a solution into his arm. The chemical begins to restore his youth but also causes a need for blood. Meanwhile, a wealthy business man has spent years searching for this fountain of youth and attempts to get it from Jesus by any means necessary, including murder, not realizing that Jesus is immortal. The rich man eventually tries to make the Faustian bargain and all is not well that ends well. Del Toros visuals are good but overall result is disappointing when compared with his later masterpiece, Pan's Labyrinth.

    How would you like to live forever? In Guillermo del Toro's Cronos we're given a cryptic look at what can happen when you're granted that wish. Reminiscent of W.W. Jacobs 1902 short story "The Monkey's Paw", Cronos chronicles Jesus Gris's (Federico Luppi) experiences with slowly becoming younger. Jesus is somewhat oblivious as to why this is happening, but he knows it has something to do with a device he found in his antiques store. The Cronos was made by an alchemist in the 1500's, and comes into the possession of Jesus by way of an angel statuette. Strange things start happening after Jesus accidentally activates the Cronos. Possibly worse than the horrid trade off of his newly found rejuvenation, is the consequence of owning such a device. Bad man want the Cronos, and will go to any lengths to get it. For the sake of his family, and most importantly the safety of his granddaughter Aurora (Tamara Shanath), Jesus must decide what to do when he is faced with an ultimatum. Will he choose wisely? In this dark fantasy film, that borders on horror, del Toro offers us an amazingly suspenseful and eerily entertaining look at the power of greed. There are a few similarities between this and Pan's Labyrinth, especially the creepy imagery juxtaposed with the innocence of a young girl. I highly enjoyed this picture, but will admit that it is no Pan's Labyrinth. However it is a great film in its own right. It's classified as a horror, but I find it to be more of a dark fantasy. Very artistic scenes and beautiful imagery, definitely worth a watch!

    Very recently, this viewer watched, for the first time, the 1958 Mexican film "The Vampire's Coffin," in which the Count Lavud--a bloodsucker very much in the traditional, uh, vein--returns to continue his nocturnal depredations. And just last night, for the first time also, I watched another Mexican film dealing with a man who has a decided thirst for blood, Guillermo del Toro's first film as a director, 1993's "Cronos." This latter picture, however, coming 35 years after the other, is anything BUT a traditional vampire tale, and reveals del Toro to be a masterful filmmaker, and a consummate craftsman. Both written and directed by del Toro, "Cronos" must be added to the list of such Great First Horror Films By A Novice Director as Mario Bava's "Black Sunday," George A. Romero's "Night of the Living Dead" and Dario Argento's "The Bird With the Crystal Plumage"; it may not be as seminal a film as any of those earlier three, but it yet bursts with the same manifest imaginative glee and sheer joy of filmmaking; the work of a first-time director anxious to show the world what he is capable of, and succeeding wildly. Unlike the American sci-fi film "Kronos" (1957), which told of an energy-draining alien contraption, "Cronos" tells of a gizmo of a very different nature. In the picture's ubercreepy and fascinating intro, the viewer learns that the Cronos device was constructed by a Spanish alchemist, Uberto Fulcanelli, in 1536; a golden, scarab-shaped construction containing moving gears and a living insect, the device can sprout spiderlike appendages and insert a stinger into its owner, conferring the gift of eternal life. Flash forward 450 years or so, and we meet a kindly, aging antique-store owner, Jesus Gris (Gray Jesus, in other words, and played by Argentinean actor Federico Luppi, who would go on to appear in the del Toro films "The Devil's Backbone" and "Pan's Labyrinth"), who lives with his wife Mercedes (Margarita Isabel) and his strange little granddaughter, Aurora (the remarkable child actress Tamara Shanath). Jesus' antique shop is very much an upscale one--not at all like the Temptations Ltd. emporium that Peter Cushing presides over in 1973's "From Beyond the Grave," to say the least--and, to be succinct, he one day discovers the ancient Cronos device hidden in the base of an archangel statue.

Strangely enough, the film that "Cronos" most brought to mind, as I watched it, was none other than the 1973 American film "Ganja and Hess." In both pictures, a decent man is pierced by an ancient artifact (the dagger of Myrthia, in the earlier film) and becomes a vampire of sorts, although the "V word" is never mentioned in either film; in both films, our transformed man ("Night of the Living Dead"'s Duane Jones, in the earlier picture) is shown daintily and disgustingly lapping up blood off of a floor!

We care not a whit for the two central characters of "Ganja and Hess," but get very much emotionally invested in the welfare of both Jesus and Aurora. In all, this is a wonderfully self-assured debut for a tyro filmmaker; as del Toro himself puts it, with typical humor and self-deprecation, in one of this DVD's many interview extras, it was "made with absolute, mad, fat-man passion and put out to the world with sincerity and brutal honesty."

    This is not your typical vampire movie. It's a stylistic, beautiful portrayal of the love between a grandfather and his granddaughter. It does new things with the vampire myth and it is the most touching Gothic love story. You can feel that this was a movie made by a man with an explosive imagination and a lot of heart put into what he was making. It is an intelligent and thought provoking film that shows vampires in a different light. This is certainly a great first film that leads into a great career for Guillermo Del Toro. Whether it's foreign films, or mainstream American Hollywood, Del Toro projects visions on the screen of unbelievable creativity and his stories are always sprinkled with a little bit of his childhood.

    This movie reminded me again and again of that cartoon with the vampire and the little girl, where the vampire would not kill the child and the child would not let the vampire go before having a zillion tea parties and tucking her to bed. Of course, the film is a lot richer, full of symbolism, but at the same time maintaining a simplicity that is both refreshing and easy to relate to. The story is OK, but more than that is the Latin American feel of it all and the mix of old music (and people) with a horror theme. Guilermo del Toro was a rookie at that time, but he made a beautiful film, together with long time collaborators Ron Perlman and Federico Luppi. Bottom line: the movie was a little slow paced and the main character both strong and weak in such a human way that it is impossible to not relate to him. The movie is clearly an experiment, as well, filled with great scenes and peppered with strangely unprofessional ones. But it works, it has it's own mood and feel and I recommend it to any horror fan out there.

    In a bid to cheat death, terminally ill millionaire De la Guardia (Claudio Brook) instructs his ruthless nephew Angel (Ron Perlman) to locate The Cronos, a mystical clockwork contraption with the power to bestow immortality on its user. Angel eventually locates the device in the possession of kindly antiques dealer Jesus (Federico Luppi), and resorts to murder to get his hands on the prize; however, having already activated the device, the old man doesn't stay dead for long. With a hunger for blood, an aversion to sunlight, and a rather manky complexion, Jesus breaks into the la Guardia home looking for answers to his bizarre condition. Cronos, the debut movie from Guillermo del Toro, is listed on IMDb as a horror, but it would be much better described as a dark fairytale: although a form of vampirism is at the heart of his script, the writer/director's focus is on Jesus's gradually evolving relationship with his young granddaughter Aurora (Tamara Shanath) and the realisation of a surreal/Gothic fantasy aesthetic. While I don't particularly mind the movie's considered pacinga slow-burn narrative does not faze me one bitand the rich shadowy cinematography is often impressive, I do tend to struggle with the self-consciously quirky, quasi-art-house approach of the type favoured by film-makers such as Jeunet et Caro and Terry Gilliam, finding it all too affected and ostentatious for my taste. Del Toro's style isn't anywhere near as excessive as those particular film-makers can be when they really put their minds to it, but it does result in just enough awkward moments, over-sentimentality and irritating calculated whimsicality to prevent it from being a wholly digestible affair (the dreadfully inappropriate score and the 'comical' mortician being perhaps the film's most notable weaknesses). 5.5/10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb.

    i didn't think this film was as good as del Toro's 'The Devil's Backbone', but it was one of the director's first and it's still scary, disturbing and memorable twenty years later. this film, though produced modestly in Mexico, signals the strong visionary style that del Toro was to eventually become known for. even though made in the 1990's 'Cronos' has the look and feel of horror films from the 1970's and late 60's. most notably the film's of Mario Bava. 'Cronos' is still memorable today because of it's handsome photography and stylish look which elevate it from other low budget horror films from the 90's or any period really. very few horror films look this good or are supplied with this kind of elegance and intelligence. it also still has the ability to scare on a dark night. maybe not as good as the intense 'Devil's Backbone', but still a horror film with more merits than many from the genre in the 90's.

    Guillermo del Toro directed and wrote Cronos, a horror tale which begins in the 1500s with a scientist inventing a device which gives eternal life. A man in current times, Jesus, discovers the magical machine a statue of an archangel. After winding it up, it awakens, grabs him and injects a solution into his arm. The chemical begins to restore his youth but also causes a need for blood. Meanwhile, a wealthy business man has spent years searching for this fountain of youth and attempts to get it from Jesus by any means necessary, including murder, not realizing that Jesus is immortal. The rich man eventually tries to make the Faustian bargain and all is not well that ends well. Del Toros visuals are good but overall result is disappointing when compared with his later masterpiece, Pan's Labyrinth.

    How would you like to live forever? In Guillermo del Toro's Cronos we're given a cryptic look at what can happen when you're granted that wish. Reminiscent of W.W. Jacobs 1902 short story "The Monkey's Paw", Cronos chronicles Jesus Gris's (Federico Luppi) experiences with slowly becoming younger. Jesus is somewhat oblivious as to why this is happening, but he knows it has something to do with a device he found in his antiques store. The Cronos was made by an alchemist in the 1500's, and comes into the possession of Jesus by way of an angel statuette. Strange things start happening after Jesus accidentally activates the Cronos. Possibly worse than the horrid trade off of his newly found rejuvenation, is the consequence of owning such a device. Bad man want the Cronos, and will go to any lengths to get it. For the sake of his family, and most importantly the safety of his granddaughter Aurora (Tamara Shanath), Jesus must decide what to do when he is faced with an ultimatum. Will he choose wisely? In this dark fantasy film, that borders on horror, del Toro offers us an amazingly suspenseful and eerily entertaining look at the power of greed. There are a few similarities between this and Pan's Labyrinth, especially the creepy imagery juxtaposed with the innocence of a young girl. I highly enjoyed this picture, but will admit that it is no Pan's Labyrinth. However it is a great film in its own right. It's classified as a horror, but I find it to be more of a dark fantasy. Very artistic scenes and beautiful imagery, definitely worth a watch!

    In 1535, an alchemist builds the cronos device, which allows for extended lifetimes. Four hundred years later, the alchemist is killed. His belongings go on public auction, and the cronos device attains anonymity. The film is about the attempts of a rich, ill man, who is obsessed with eternal life, to obtain the cronos device. Cinematography: 9/10 Good. Sound: 9/10 Adequate, but with occasional overwrought incidental music. Acting: 10/10 Fine acting by the five leads. Screenplay: 10/10 Exceptional. The director's touch is evident even in this first effort. Motivation, exposition of consequences, and logical flow of events were right on the money. The ends that the characters meet fit their personalities, which was a nice touch, and one frequently omitted in more current films.

    I am becoming more and more impressed with Guillermo Del Toro's work. I found Hellboy to be a great comic book movie and Hellboy 2 to be everything I am looking for in a superhero movie. Pan's Labyrinth was a classic, great fantasy storytelling. Blade 2, although my least favourite of the Blade series was very entertaining and provided great emotional attachment to the characters. I found this in a shop today and I simply could not let it go. Knowing his other stuff I wanted to see his first full-length movie. The plot is that in the 15th Century an Alchemist builds a beetle that emits a parasite into human flesh that makes them live longer, but also having a harshness to sunlight and a strange thirst for human blood - it's called Cronos. In a modern day Mexico an antique store owner (Frederico Luppi) and his granddaughter find out that an angel relic was hollow and inside is the Cronos and infects the antique store owner. Meanwhile an old rich man and his nephew (Ron Perlman) stop at nothing to find the Cronos device. Guillermo Del Toro is quickly becoming one of my favourite directors now. I did enjoy the imaginative spin on a rather tired out concept (well maybe not back 20 years ago but look at things now!). I did enjoy the acting from Frederico Luppi. If you are a fan of Del Toro (or knows what kind of movies he makes) then this is definitely worth a watch. It isn't as good as Hellboy 2 or Pan's Labyrinth (his masterpieces!) but it is enjoyable.

    Very recently, this viewer watched, for the first time, the 1958 Mexican film "The Vampire's Coffin," in which the Count Lavud--a bloodsucker very much in the traditional, uh, vein--returns to continue his nocturnal depredations. And just last night, for the first time also, I watched another Mexican film dealing with a man who has a decided thirst for blood, Guillermo del Toro's first film as a director, 1993's "Cronos." This latter picture, however, coming 35 years after the other, is anything BUT a traditional vampire tale, and reveals del Toro to be a masterful filmmaker, and a consummate craftsman. Both written and directed by del Toro, "Cronos" must be added to the list of such Great First Horror Films By A Novice Director as Mario Bava's "Black Sunday," George A. Romero's "Night of the Living Dead" and Dario Argento's "The Bird With the Crystal Plumage"; it may not be as seminal a film as any of those earlier three, but it yet bursts with the same manifest imaginative glee and sheer joy of filmmaking; the work of a first-time director anxious to show the world what he is capable of, and succeeding wildly. Unlike the American sci-fi film "Kronos" (1957), which told of an energy-draining alien contraption, "Cronos" tells of a gizmo of a very different nature. In the picture's ubercreepy and fascinating intro, the viewer learns that the Cronos device was constructed by a Spanish alchemist, Uberto Fulcanelli, in 1536; a golden, scarab-shaped construction containing moving gears and a living insect, the device can sprout spiderlike appendages and insert a stinger into its owner, conferring the gift of eternal life. Flash forward 450 years or so, and we meet a kindly, aging antique-store owner, Jesus Gris (Gray Jesus, in other words, and played by Argentinean actor Federico Luppi, who would go on to appear in the del Toro films "The Devil's Backbone" and "Pan's Labyrinth"), who lives with his wife Mercedes (Margarita Isabel) and his strange little granddaughter, Aurora (the remarkable child actress Tamara Shanath). Jesus' antique shop is very much an upscale one--not at all like the Temptations Ltd. emporium that Peter Cushing presides over in 1973's "From Beyond the Grave," to say the least--and, to be succinct, he one day discovers the ancient Cronos device hidden in the base of an archangel statue. Jesus is very quickly affected by the gizmo and is soon afflicted with a taste for blood. Meanwhile, his already tough predicament worsens when thuggish goon Angel (Ron Perlman, who himself would go on to appear in the del Toro films "Blade 2," "Hellboy" and its sequel), emissary and nephew of dying millionaire De la Guardia (Claudio Brook), starts to get decidedly violent in his own search for the Cronos device.... Strangely enough, the film that "Cronos" most brought to mind, as I watched it, was none other than the 1973 American film "Ganja and Hess." In both pictures, a decent man is pierced by an ancient artifact (the dagger of Myrthia, in the earlier film) and becomes a vampire of sorts, although the "V word" is never mentioned in either film; in both films, our transformed man ("Night of the Living Dead"'s Duane Jones, in the earlier picture) is shown daintily and disgustingly lapping up blood off of a floor! But that is pretty much where the similarity ends, and while "Ganja and Hess" is painfully slow moving and even managed the near-impossible task of putting me to sleep (the only film to ever accomplish this!), "Cronos" is at once compact, fast moving, suspenseful, colorful and exciting. It is also filled with all sorts of imaginative and oddball touches, such as Angel's nose fetish, a side trip to a very strange mortician's workshop, and those jars of (his very own) preserved organs that De la Guardia keeps on display. And speaking of oddball, the Aurora character is a very strange one indeed, a nearly mute little girl (I believe she speaks but a single word during the course of the entire film) whose unwavering love of and support for her grandfather--despite the horrible transformations he undergoes--are very much the sweet soul of this ultimately touching film. We care not a whit for the two central characters of "Ganja and Hess," but get very much emotionally invested in the welfare of both Jesus and Aurora. In all, this is a wonderfully self-assured debut for a tyro filmmaker; as del Toro himself puts it, with typical humor and self-deprecation, in one of this DVD's many interview extras, it was "made with absolute, mad, fat-man passion and put out to the world with sincerity and brutal honesty." Happily, that passion is clearly evident throughout this marvelous film. One final word concerning this DVD itself. It is a Criterion DVD, and I suppose that alone should testify as to its quality and generous content. Extras include interviews with del Toro, Perlman, Luppi and cinematographer Guillermo Navarro (who, incidentally, does a wonderful job here, and who would go on to win an Oscar for his work on "Pan's Labyrinth"), as well as del Toro's first short film, 1987's "Geometria," AND a tour of del Toro's office/house/museum, Bleak House. This abode contains hundreds and hundreds of rare books, film collectibles and sundry horror/fantasy pieces, and with any justice will one day be open to the public via paid admission. A most impressive collection, from a man whose love for film seems virtually boundless....

    Since we were little we heard tales of wizards, alchemists and different substances which have the power to give eternal life ... the director Guillermo del Toro invites us to make a journey into these stories through his film "Cronos" (1993, Mexico), which is his first film. The antiques dealer, Jesus Gris (Federico Luppi) discovers a strange device capable of giving its wearer eternal life ... that's the story that is told in a linear fashion. It is a strong story about ambition, power and character because throughout the film we see the protagonist struggle with himself unable to resist this "drug" that slowly consumes him. The funny thing is that he is not a person who wants to live forever, but he wants to live as long as necessary to fulfill your goals. With this film we begin to distinguish the style that del Toro will explode later in films like "Pan's Labyrinth" (2006, Spain, Mexico, USA), we see everything in a dark "mood" with religious signs and with a child who connects people with the world of fiction. It's a film that has some plot holes, start telling us a story that engages by itself, but it seems that slowly decays as the film progresses and costs spinning certain things, as there are details that presents which didn't have logical explanation and come to seem a bit absurd. It has an ending that is not predictable, but that is not surprising and is loose enough. It is a story of magical realism that becomes a strange variant of vampire movies told in a somewhat cold and graphic fashion, which can sometimes be grotesque, but all the mystery that surrounds it is what makes that the spectator can't stop seeing it, although it does not have enough characters empathetic and some are very gray. &nbsp;The script is pretty weak (lacking strength), draws attention because of what we want to see, but how has it ends up leaving you wanting more.

    Very recently, this viewer watched, for the first time, the 1958 Mexican film "The Vampire's Coffin," in which the Count Lavud--a bloodsucker very much in the traditional, uh, vein--returns to continue his nocturnal depredations. And just last night, for the first time also, I watched another Mexican film dealing with a man who has a decided thirst for blood, Guillermo del Toro's first film as a director, 1993's "Cronos." This latter picture, however, coming 35 years after the other, is anything BUT a traditional vampire tale, and reveals del Toro to be a masterful filmmaker, and a consummate craftsman. Both written and directed by del Toro, "Cronos" must be added to the list of such Great First Horror Films By A Novice Director as Mario Bava's "Black Sunday," George A. Romero's "Night of the Living Dead" and Dario Argento's "The Bird With the Crystal Plumage"; it may not be as seminal a film as any of those earlier three, but it yet bursts with the same manifest imaginative glee and sheer joy of filmmaking; the work of a first-time director anxious to show the world what he is capable of, and succeeding wildly. Unlike the American sci-fi film "Kronos" (1957), which told of an energy-draining alien contraption, "Cronos" tells of a gizmo of a very different nature. In the picture's ubercreepy and fascinating intro, the viewer learns that the Cronos device was constructed by a Spanish alchemist, Uberto Fulcanelli, in 1536; a golden, scarab-shaped construction containing moving gears and a living insect, the device can sprout spiderlike appendages and insert a stinger into its owner, conferring the gift of eternal life. Flash forward 450 years or so, and we meet a kindly, aging antique-store owner, Jesus Gris (Gray Jesus, in other words, and played by Argentinean actor Federico Luppi, who would go on to appear in the del Toro films "The Devil's Backbone" and "Pan's Labyrinth"), who lives with his wife Mercedes (Margarita Isabel) and his strange little granddaughter, Aurora (the remarkable child actress Tamara Shanath). Jesus' antique shop is very much an upscale one--not at all like the Temptations Ltd. emporium that Peter Cushing presides over in 1973's "From Beyond the Grave," to say the least--and, to be succinct, he one day discovers the ancient Cronos device hidden in the base of an archangel statue. Jesus is very quickly affected by the gizmo and is soon afflicted with a taste for blood. Meanwhile, his already tough predicament worsens when thuggish goon Angel (Ron Perlman, who himself would go on to appear in the del Toro films "Blade 2," "Hellboy" and its sequel), emissary and nephew of dying millionaire De la Guardia (Claudio Brook), starts to get decidedly violent in his own search for the Cronos device.... Strangely enough, the film that "Cronos" most brought to mind, as I watched it, was none other than the 1973 American film "Ganja and Hess." In both pictures, a decent man is pierced by an ancient artifact (the dagger of Myrthia, in the earlier film) and becomes a vampire of sorts, although the "V word" is never mentioned in either film; in both films, our transformed man ("Night of the Living Dead"'s Duane Jones, in the earlier picture) is shown daintily and disgustingly lapping up blood off of a floor! But that is pretty much where the similarity ends, and while "Ganja and Hess" is painfully slow moving and even managed the near-impossible task of putting me to sleep (the only film to ever accomplish this!), "Cronos" is at once compact, fast moving, suspenseful, colorful and exciting. It is also filled with all sorts of imaginative and oddball touches, such as Angel's nose fetish, a side trip to a very strange mortician's workshop, and those jars of (his very own) preserved organs that De la Guardia keeps on display. And speaking of oddball, the Aurora character is a very strange one indeed, a nearly mute little girl (I believe she speaks but a single word during the course of the entire film) whose unwavering love of and support for her grandfather--despite the horrible transformations he undergoes--are very much the sweet soul of this ultimately touching film. We care not a whit for the two central characters of "Ganja and Hess," but get very much emotionally invested in the welfare of both Jesus and Aurora. In all, this is a wonderfully self-assured debut for a tyro filmmaker; as del Toro himself puts it, with typical humor and self-deprecation, in one of this DVD's many interview extras, it was "made with absolute, mad, fat-man passion and put out to the world with sincerity and brutal honesty." Happily, that passion is clearly evident throughout this marvelous film. One final word concerning this DVD itself. It is a Criterion DVD, and I suppose that alone should testify as to its quality and generous content. Extras include interviews with del Toro, Perlman, Luppi and cinematographer Guillermo Navarro (who, incidentally, does a wonderful job here, and who would go on to win an Oscar for his work on "Pan's Labyrinth"), as well as del Toro's first short film, 1987's "Geometria," AND a tour of del Toro's office/house/museum, Bleak House. This abode contains hundreds and hundreds of rare books, film collectibles and sundry horror/fantasy pieces, and with any justice will one day be open to the public via paid admission. A most impressive collection, from a man whose love for film seems virtually boundless....

    Since we were little we heard tales of wizards, alchemists and different substances which have the power to give eternal life ... the director Guillermo del Toro invites us to make a journey into these stories through his film "Cronos" (1993, Mexico), which is his first film. The antiques dealer, Jesus Gris (Federico Luppi) discovers a strange device capable of giving its wearer eternal life ... that's the story that is told in a linear fashion. It is a strong story about ambition, power and character because throughout the film we see the protagonist struggle with himself unable to resist this "drug" that slowly consumes him. The funny thing is that he is not a person who wants to live forever, but he wants to live as long as necessary to fulfill your goals. With this film we begin to distinguish the style that del Toro will explode later in films like "Pan's Labyrinth" (2006, Spain, Mexico, USA), we see everything in a dark "mood" with religious signs and with a child who connects people with the world of fiction. It's a film that has some plot holes, start telling us a story that engages by itself, but it seems that slowly decays as the film progresses and costs spinning certain things, as there are details that presents which didn't have logical explanation and come to seem a bit absurd. It has an ending that is not predictable, but that is not surprising and is loose enough. It is a story of magical realism that becomes a strange variant of vampire movies told in a somewhat cold and graphic fashion, which can sometimes be grotesque, but all the mystery that surrounds it is what makes that the spectator can't stop seeing it, although it does not have enough characters empathetic and some are very gray. &nbsp;The script is pretty weak (lacking strength), draws attention because of what we want to see, but how has it ends up leaving you wanting more.

    This is not your typical vampire movie. It's a stylistic, beautiful portrayal of the love between a grandfather and his granddaughter. It does new things with the vampire myth and it is the most touching Gothic love story. You can feel that this was a movie made by a man with an explosive imagination and a lot of heart put into what he was making. It is an intelligent and thought provoking film that shows vampires in a different light. This is certainly a great first film that leads into a great career for Guillermo Del Toro. Whether it's foreign films, or mainstream American Hollywood, Del Toro projects visions on the screen of unbelievable creativity and his stories are always sprinkled with a little bit of his childhood.

    This movie reminded me again and again of that cartoon with the vampire and the little girl, where the vampire would not kill the child and the child would not let the vampire go before having a zillion tea parties and tucking her to bed. Of course, the film is a lot richer, full of symbolism, but at the same time maintaining a simplicity that is both refreshing and easy to relate to. The story is OK, but more than that is the Latin American feel of it all and the mix of old music (and people) with a horror theme. Guilermo del Toro was a rookie at that time, but he made a beautiful film, together with long time collaborators Ron Perlman and Federico Luppi. Bottom line: the movie was a little slow paced and the main character both strong and weak in such a human way that it is impossible to not relate to him. The movie is clearly an experiment, as well, filled with great scenes and peppered with strangely unprofessional ones. But it works, it has it's own mood and feel and I recommend it to any horror fan out there.

    In a bid to cheat death, terminally ill millionaire De la Guardia (Claudio Brook) instructs his ruthless nephew Angel (Ron Perlman) to locate The Cronos, a mystical clockwork contraption with the power to bestow immortality on its user. Angel eventually locates the device in the possession of kindly antiques dealer Jesus (Federico Luppi), and resorts to murder to get his hands on the prize; however, having already activated the device, the old man doesn't stay dead for long. With a hunger for blood, an aversion to sunlight, and a rather manky complexion, Jesus breaks into the la Guardia home looking for answers to his bizarre condition. Cronos, the debut movie from Guillermo del Toro, is listed on IMDb as a horror, but it would be much better described as a dark fairytale: although a form of vampirism is at the heart of his script, the writer/director's focus is on Jesus's gradually evolving relationship with his young granddaughter Aurora (Tamara Shanath) and the realisation of a surreal/Gothic fantasy aesthetic. While I don't particularly mind the movie's considered pacinga slow-burn narrative does not faze me one bitand the rich shadowy cinematography is often impressive, I do tend to struggle with the self-consciously quirky, quasi-art-house approach of the type favoured by film-makers such as Jeunet et Caro and Terry Gilliam, finding it all too affected and ostentatious for my taste. Del Toro's style isn't anywhere near as excessive as those particular film-makers can be when they really put their minds to it, but it does result in just enough awkward moments, over-sentimentality and irritating calculated whimsicality to prevent it from being a wholly digestible affair (the dreadfully inappropriate score and the 'comical' mortician being perhaps the film's most notable weaknesses). 5.5/10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb.

    i didn't think this film was as good as del Toro's 'The Devil's Backbone', but it was one of the director's first and it's still scary, disturbing and memorable twenty years later. this film, though produced modestly in Mexico, signals the strong visionary style that del Toro was to eventually become known for. even though made in the 1990's 'Cronos' has the look and feel of horror films from the 1970's and late 60's. most notably the film's of Mario Bava. 'Cronos' is still memorable today because of it's handsome photography and stylish look which elevate it from other low budget horror films from the 90's or any period really. very few horror films look this good or are supplied with this kind of elegance and intelligence. it also still has the ability to scare on a dark night. maybe not as good as the intense 'Devil's Backbone', but still a horror film with more merits than many from the genre in the 90's.

    Guillermo del Toro directed and wrote Cronos, a horror tale which begins in the 1500s with a scientist inventing a device which gives eternal life. A man in current times, Jesus, discovers the magical machine a statue of an archangel. After winding it up, it awakens, grabs him and injects a solution into his arm. The chemical begins to restore his youth but also causes a need for blood. Meanwhile, a wealthy business man has spent years searching for this fountain of youth and attempts to get it from Jesus by any means necessary, including murder, not realizing that Jesus is immortal. The rich man eventually tries to make the Faustian bargain and all is not well that ends well. Del Toros visuals are good but overall result is disappointing when compared with his later masterpiece, Pan's Labyrinth.

    How would you like to live forever? In Guillermo del Toro's Cronos we're given a cryptic look at what can happen when you're granted that wish. Reminiscent of W.W. Jacobs 1902 short story "The Monkey's Paw", Cronos chronicles Jesus Gris's (Federico Luppi) experiences with slowly becoming younger. Jesus is somewhat oblivious as to why this is happening, but he knows it has something to do with a device he found in his antiques store. The Cronos was made by an alchemist in the 1500's, and comes into the possession of Jesus by way of an angel statuette. Strange things start happening after Jesus accidentally activates the Cronos. Possibly worse than the horrid trade off of his newly found rejuvenation, is the consequence of owning such a device. Bad man want the Cronos, and will go to any lengths to get it. For the sake of his family, and most importantly the safety of his granddaughter Aurora (Tamara Shanath), Jesus must decide what to do when he is faced with an ultimatum. Will he choose wisely? In this dark fantasy film, that borders on horror, del Toro offers us an amazingly suspenseful and eerily entertaining look at the power of greed. There are a few similarities between this and Pan's Labyrinth, especially the creepy imagery juxtaposed with the innocence of a young girl. I highly enjoyed this picture, but will admit that it is no Pan's Labyrinth. However it is a great film in its own right. It's classified as a horror, but I find it to be more of a dark fantasy. Very artistic scenes and beautiful imagery, definitely worth a watch!

    In 1535, an alchemist builds the cronos device, which allows for extended lifetimes. Four hundred years later, the alchemist is killed. His belongings go on public auction, and the cronos device attains anonymity. The film is about the attempts of a rich, ill man, who is obsessed with eternal life, to obtain the cronos device. Cinematography: 9/10 Good. Sound: 9/10 Adequate, but with occasional overwrought incidental music. Acting: 10/10 Fine acting by the five leads. Screenplay: 10/10 Exceptional. The director's touch is evident even in this first effort. Motivation, exposition of consequences, and logical flow of events were right on the money. The ends that the characters meet fit their personalities, which was a nice touch, and one frequently omitted in more current films.

    I am becoming more and more impressed with Guillermo Del Toro's work. I found Hellboy to be a great comic book movie and Hellboy 2 to be everything I am looking for in a superhero movie. Pan's Labyrinth was a classic, great fantasy storytelling. Blade 2, although my least favourite of the Blade series was very entertaining and provided great emotional attachment to the characters. I found this in a shop today and I simply could not let it go. Knowing his other stuff I wanted to see his first full-length movie. The plot is that in the 15th Century an Alchemist builds a beetle that emits a parasite into human flesh that makes them live longer, but also having a harshness to sunlight and a strange thirst for human blood - it's called Cronos. In a modern day Mexico an antique store owner (Frederico Luppi) and his granddaughter find out that an angel relic was hollow and inside is the Cronos and infects the antique store owner. Meanwhile an old rich man and his nephew (Ron Perlman) stop at nothing to find the Cronos device. Guillermo Del Toro is quickly becoming one of my favourite directors now. I did enjoy the imaginative spin on a rather tired out concept (well maybe not back 20 years ago but look at things now!). I did enjoy the acting from Frederico Luppi. If you are a fan of Del Toro (or knows what kind of movies he makes) then this is definitely worth a watch. It isn't as good as Hellboy 2 or Pan's Labyrinth (his masterpieces!) but it is enjoyable.

    Very recently, this viewer watched, for the first time, the 1958 Mexican film "The Vampire's Coffin," in which the Count Lavud--a bloodsucker very much in the traditional, uh, vein--returns to continue his nocturnal depredations. And just last night, for the first time also, I watched another Mexican film dealing with a man who has a decided thirst for blood, Guillermo del Toro's first film as a director, 1993's "Cronos." This latter picture, however, coming 35 years after the other, is anything BUT a traditional vampire tale, and reveals del Toro to be a masterful filmmaker, and a consummate craftsman. Both written and directed by del Toro, "Cronos" must be added to the list of such Great First Horror Films By A Novice Director as Mario Bava's "Black Sunday," George A. Romero's "Night of the Living Dead" and Dario Argento's "The Bird With the Crystal Plumage"; it may not be as seminal a film as any of those earlier three, but it yet bursts with the same manifest imaginative glee and sheer joy of filmmaking; the work of a first-time director anxious to show the world what he is capable of, and succeeding wildly. Unlike the American sci-fi film "Kronos" (1957), which told of an energy-draining alien contraption, "Cronos" tells of a gizmo of a very different nature. In the picture's ubercreepy and fascinating intro, the viewer learns that the Cronos device was constructed by a Spanish alchemist, Uberto Fulcanelli, in 1536; a golden, scarab-shaped construction containing moving gears and a living insect, the device can sprout spiderlike appendages and insert a stinger into its owner, conferring the gift of eternal life. Flash forward 450 years or so, and we meet a kindly, aging antique-store owner, Jesus Gris (Gray Jesus, in other words, and played by Argentinean actor Federico Luppi, who would go on to appear in the del Toro films "The Devil's Backbone" and "Pan's Labyrinth"), who lives with his wife Mercedes (Margarita Isabel) and his strange little granddaughter, Aurora (the remarkable child actress Tamara Shanath). Jesus' antique shop is very much an upscale one--not at all like the Temptations Ltd. emporium that Peter Cushing presides over in 1973's "From Beyond the Grave," to say the least--and, to be succinct, he one day discovers the ancient Cronos device hidden in the base of an archangel statue. Jesus is very quickly affected by the gizmo and is soon afflicted with a taste for blood. Meanwhile, his already tough predicament worsens when thuggish goon Angel (Ron Perlman, who himself would go on to appear in the del Toro films "Blade 2," "Hellboy" and its sequel), emissary and nephew of dying millionaire De la Guardia (Claudio Brook), starts to get decidedly violent in his own search for the Cronos device.... Strangely enough, the film that "Cronos" most brought to mind, as I watched it, was none other than the 1973 American film "Ganja and Hess." In both pictures, a decent man is pierced by an ancient artifact (the dagger of Myrthia, in the earlier film) and becomes a vampire of sorts, although the "V word" is never mentioned in either film; in both films, our transformed man ("Night of the Living Dead"'s Duane Jones, in the earlier picture) is shown daintily and disgustingly lapping up blood off of a floor!

We care not a whit for the two central characters of "Ganja and Hess," but get very much emotionally invested in the welfare of both Jesus and Aurora. In all, this is a wonderfully self-assured debut for a tyro filmmaker; as del Toro himself puts it, with typical humor and self-deprecation, in one of this DVD's many interview extras, it was "made with absolute, mad, fat-man passion and put out to the world with sincerity and brutal honesty."

The rich man eventually tries to make the Faustian bargain and all is not well that ends well. Del Toros visuals are good but overall result is disappointing when compared with his later masterpiece, Pan's Labyrinth.

    How would you like to live forever? In Guillermo del Toro's Cronos we're given a cryptic look at what can happen when you're granted that wish. Reminiscent of W.W. Jacobs 1902 short story "The Monkey's Paw", Cronos chronicles Jesus Gris's (Federico Luppi) experiences with slowly becoming younger. Jesus is somewhat oblivious as to why this is happening, but he knows it has something to do with a device he found in his antiques store. The Cronos was made by an alchemist in the 1500's, and comes into the possession of Jesus by way of an angel statuette. Strange things start happening after Jesus accidentally activates the Cronos. Possibly worse than the horrid trade off of his newly found rejuvenation, is the consequence of owning such a device. Bad man want the Cronos, and will go to any lengths to get it. For the sake of his family, and most importantly the safety of his granddaughter Aurora (Tamara Shanath), Jesus must decide what to do when he is faced with an ultimatum. Will he choose wisely? In this dark fantasy film, that borders on horror, del Toro offers us an amazingly suspenseful and eerily entertaining look at the power of greed. There are a few similarities between this and Pan's Labyrinth, especially the creepy imagery juxtaposed with the innocence of a young girl. I highly enjoyed this picture, but will admit that it is no Pan's Labyrinth. However it is a great film in its own right. It's classified as a horror, but I find it to be more of a dark fantasy. Very artistic scenes and beautiful imagery, definitely worth a watch!

    In 1535, an alchemist builds the cronos device, which allows for extended lifetimes. Four hundred years later, the alchemist is killed. His belongings go on public auction, and the cronos device attains anonymity. The film is about the attempts of a rich, ill man, who is obsessed with eternal life, to obtain the cronos device. Cinematography: 9/10 Good. Sound: 9/10 Adequate, but with occasional overwrought incidental music. Acting: 10/10 Fine acting by the five leads. Screenplay: 10/10 Exceptional. The director's touch is evident even in this first effort. Motivation, exposition of consequences, and logical flow of events were right on the money. The ends that the characters meet fit their personalities, which was a nice touch, and one frequently omitted in more current films.

    I am becoming more and more impressed with Guillermo Del Toro's work. I found Hellboy to be a great comic book movie and Hellboy 2 to be everything I am looking for in a superhero movie. Pan's Labyrinth was a classic, great fantasy storytelling. Blade 2, although my least favourite of the Blade series was very entertaining and provided great emotional attachment to the characters. I found this in a shop today and I simply could not let it go. Knowing his other stuff I wanted to see his first full-length movie. The plot is that in the 15th Century an Alchemist builds a beetle that emits a parasite into human flesh that makes them live longer, but also having a harshness to sunlight and a strange thirst for human blood - it's called Cronos. In a modern day Mexico an antique store owner (Frederico Luppi) and his granddaughter find out that an angel relic was hollow and inside is the Cronos and infects the antique store owner. Meanwhile an old rich man and his nephew (Ron Perlman) stop at nothing to find the Cronos device. Guillermo Del Toro is quickly becoming one of my favourite directors now. I did enjoy the imaginative spin on a rather tired out concept (well maybe not back 20 years ago but look at things now!). I did enjoy the acting from Frederico Luppi. If you are a fan of Del Toro (or knows what kind of movies he makes) then this is definitely worth a watch. It isn't as good as Hellboy 2 or Pan's Labyrinth (his masterpieces!) but it is enjoyable.

    Very recently, this viewer watched, for the first time, the 1958 Mexican film "The Vampire's Coffin," in which the Count Lavud--a bloodsucker very much in the traditional, uh, vein--returns to continue his nocturnal depredations. And just last night, for the first time also, I watched another Mexican film dealing with a man who has a decided thirst for blood, Guillermo del Toro's first film as a director, 1993's "Cronos." This latter picture, however, coming 35 years after the other, is anything BUT a traditional vampire tale, and reveals del Toro to be a masterful filmmaker, and a consummate craftsman. Both written and directed by del Toro, "Cronos" must be added to the list of such Great First Horror Films By A Novice Director as Mario Bava's "Black Sunday," George A. Romero's "Night of the Living Dead" and Dario Argento's "The Bird With the Crystal Plumage"; it may not be as seminal a film as any of those earlier three, but it yet bursts with the same manifest imaginative glee and sheer joy of filmmaking; the work of a first-time director anxious to show the world what he is capable of, and succeeding wildly. Unlike the American sci-fi film "Kronos" (1957), which told of an energy-draining alien contraption, "Cronos" tells of a gizmo of a very different nature. In the picture's ubercreepy and fascinating intro, the viewer learns that the Cronos device was constructed by a Spanish alchemist, Uberto Fulcanelli, in 1536; a golden, scarab-shaped construction containing moving gears and a living insect, the device can sprout spiderlike appendages and insert a stinger into its owner, conferring the gift of eternal life. Flash forward 450 years or so, and we meet a kindly, aging antique-store owner, Jesus Gris (Gray Jesus, in other words, and played by Argentinean actor Federico Luppi, who would go on to appear in the del Toro films "The Devil's Backbone" and "Pan's Labyrinth"), who lives with his wife Mercedes (Margarita Isabel) and his strange little granddaughter, Aurora (the remarkable child actress Tamara Shanath). Jesus' antique shop is very much an upscale one--not at all like the Temptations Ltd. emporium that Peter Cushing presides over in 1973's "From Beyond the Grave," to say the least--and, to be succinct, he one day discovers the ancient Cronos device hidden in the base of an archangel statue. Jesus is very quickly affected by the gizmo and is soon afflicted with a taste for blood. Meanwhile, his already tough predicament worsens when thuggish goon Angel (Ron Perlman, who himself would go on to appear in the del Toro films "Blade 2," "Hellboy" and its sequel), emissary and nephew of dying millionaire De la Guardia (Claudio Brook), starts to get decidedly violent in his own search for the Cronos device.... Strangely enough, the film that "Cronos" most brought to mind, as I watched it, was none other than the 1973 American film "Ganja and Hess." In both pictures, a decent man is pierced by an ancient artifact (the dagger of Myrthia, in the earlier film) and becomes a vampire of sorts, although the "V word" is never mentioned in either film; in both films, our transformed man ("Night of the Living Dead"'s Duane Jones, in the earlier picture) is shown daintily and disgustingly lapping up blood off of a floor! But that is pretty much where the similarity ends, and while "Ganja and Hess" is painfully slow moving and even managed the near-impossible task of putting me to sleep (the only film to ever accomplish this!), "Cronos" is at once compact, fast moving, suspenseful, colorful and exciting. It is also filled with all sorts of imaginative and oddball touches, such as Angel's nose fetish, a side trip to a very strange mortician's workshop, and those jars of (his very own) preserved organs that De la Guardia keeps on display. And speaking of oddball, the Aurora character is a very strange one indeed, a nearly mute little girl (I believe she speaks but a single word during the course of the entire film) whose unwavering love of and support for her grandfather--despite the horrible transformations he undergoes--are very much the sweet soul of this ultimately touching film. We care not a whit for the two central characters of "Ganja and Hess," but get very much emotionally invested in the welfare of both Jesus and Aurora. In all, this is a wonderfully self-assured debut for a tyro filmmaker; as del Toro himself puts it, with typical humor and self-deprecation, in one of this DVD's many interview extras, it was "made with absolute, mad, fat-man passion and put out to the world with sincerity and brutal honesty." Happily, that passion is clearly evident throughout this marvelous film. One final word concerning this DVD itself. It is a Criterion DVD, and I suppose that alone should testify as to its quality and generous content. Extras include interviews with del Toro, Perlman, Luppi and cinematographer Guillermo Navarro (who, incidentally, does a wonderful job here, and who would go on to win an Oscar for his work on "Pan's Labyrinth"), as well as del Toro's first short film, 1987's "Geometria," AND a tour of del Toro's office/house/museum, Bleak House. This abode contains hundreds and hundreds of rare books, film collectibles and sundry horror/fantasy pieces, and with any justice will one day be open to the public via paid admission. A most impressive collection, from a man whose love for film seems virtually boundless....

    Since we were little we heard tales of wizards, alchemists and different substances which have the power to give eternal life ... the director Guillermo del Toro invites us to make a journey into these stories through his film "Cronos" (1993, Mexico), which is his first film. The antiques dealer, Jesus Gris (Federico Luppi) discovers a strange device capable of giving its wearer eternal life ... that's the story that is told in a linear fashion. It is a strong story about ambition, power and character because throughout the film we see the protagonist struggle with himself unable to resist this "drug" that slowly consumes him. The funny thing is that he is not a person who wants to live forever, but he wants to live as long as necessary to fulfill your goals. With this film we begin to distinguish the style that del Toro will explode later in films like "Pan's Labyrinth" (2006, Spain, Mexico, USA), we see everything in a dark "mood" with religious signs and with a child who connects people with the world of fiction. It's a film that has some plot holes, start telling us a story that engages by itself, but it seems that slowly decays as the film progresses and costs spinning certain things, as there are details that presents which didn't have logical explanation and come to seem a bit absurd. It has an ending that is not predictable, but that is not surprising and is loose enough. It is a story of magical realism that becomes a strange variant of vampire movies told in a somewhat cold and graphic fashion, which can sometimes be grotesque, but all the mystery that surrounds it is what makes that the spectator can't stop seeing it, although it does not have enough characters empathetic and some are very gray. &nbsp;The script is pretty weak (lacking strength), draws attention because of what we want to see, but how has it ends up leaving you wanting more.

    This is not your typical vampire movie. It's a stylistic, beautiful portrayal of the love between a grandfather and his granddaughter. It does new things with the vampire myth and it is the most touching Gothic love story. You can feel that this was a movie made by a man with an explosive imagination and a lot of heart put into what he was making. It is an intelligent and thought provoking film that shows vampires in a different light. This is certainly a great first film that leads into a great career for Guillermo Del Toro. Whether it's foreign films, or mainstream American Hollywood, Del Toro projects visions on the screen of unbelievable creativity and his stories are always sprinkled with a little bit of his childhood.

    This movie reminded me again and again of that cartoon with the vampire and the little girl, where the vampire would not kill the child and the child would not let the vampire go before having a zillion tea parties and tucking her to bed. Of course, the film is a lot richer, full of symbolism, but at the same time maintaining a simplicity that is both refreshing and easy to relate to. The story is OK, but more than that is the Latin American feel of it all and the mix of old music (and people) with a horror theme. Guilermo del Toro was a rookie at that time, but he made a beautiful film, together with long time collaborators Ron Perlman and Federico Luppi. Bottom line: the movie was a little slow paced and the main character both strong and weak in such a human way that it is impossible to not relate to him. The movie is clearly an experiment, as well, filled with great scenes and peppered with strangely unprofessional ones. But it works, it has it's own mood and feel and I recommend it to any horror fan out there.

    In a bid to cheat death, terminally ill millionaire De la Guardia (Claudio Brook) instructs his ruthless nephew Angel (Ron Perlman) to locate The Cronos, a mystical clockwork contraption with the power to bestow immortality on its user. Angel eventually locates the device in the possession of kindly antiques dealer Jesus (Federico Luppi), and resorts to murder to get his hands on the prize; however, having already activated the device, the old man doesn't stay dead for long. With a hunger for blood, an aversion to sunlight, and a rather manky complexion, Jesus breaks into the la Guardia home looking for answers to his bizarre condition. Cronos, the debut movie from Guillermo del Toro, is listed on IMDb as a horror, but it would be much better described as a dark fairytale: although a form of vampirism is at the heart of his script, the writer/director's focus is on Jesus's gradually evolving relationship with his young granddaughter Aurora (Tamara Shanath) and the realisation of a surreal/Gothic fantasy aesthetic. While I don't particularly mind the movie's considered pacinga slow-burn narrative does not faze me one bitand the rich shadowy cinematography is often impressive, I do tend to struggle with the self-consciously quirky, quasi-art-house approach of the type favoured by film-makers such as Jeunet et Caro and Terry Gilliam, finding it all too affected and ostentatious for my taste. Del Toro's style isn't anywhere near as excessive as those particular film-makers can be when they really put their minds to it, but it does result in just enough awkward moments, over-sentimentality and irritating calculated whimsicality to prevent it from being a wholly digestible affair (the dreadfully inappropriate score and the 'comical' mortician being perhaps the film's most notable weaknesses). 5.5/10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb.

    i didn't think this film was as good as del Toro's 'The Devil's Backbone', but it was one of the director's first and it's still scary, disturbing and memorable twenty years later. this film, though produced modestly in Mexico, signals the strong visionary style that del Toro was to eventually become known for. even though made in the 1990's 'Cronos' has the look and feel of horror films from the 1970's and late 60's. most notably the film's of Mario Bava. 'Cronos' is still memorable today because of it's handsome photography and stylish look which elevate it from other low budget horror films from the 90's or any period really. very few horror films look this good or are supplied with this kind of elegance and intelligence. it also still has the ability to scare on a dark night. maybe not as good as the intense 'Devil's Backbone', but still a horror film with more merits than many from the genre in the 90's.

    Guillermo del Toro directed and wrote Cronos, a horror tale which begins in the 1500s with a scientist inventing a device which gives eternal life. A man in current times, Jesus, discovers the magical machine a statue of an archangel. After winding it up, it awakens, grabs him and injects a solution into his arm. The chemical begins to restore his youth but also causes a need for blood. Meanwhile, a wealthy business man has spent years searching for this fountain of youth and attempts to get it from Jesus by any means necessary, including murder, not realizing that Jesus is immortal. The rich man eventually tries to make the Faustian bargain and all is not well that ends well. Del Toros visuals are good but overall result is disappointing when compared with his later masterpiece, Pan's Labyrinth.

    I am becoming more and more impressed with Guillermo Del Toro's work. I found Hellboy to be a great comic book movie and Hellboy 2 to be everything I am looking for in a superhero movie. Pan's Labyrinth was a classic, great fantasy storytelling. Blade 2, although my least favourite of the Blade series was very entertaining and provided great emotional attachment to the characters.

    Very recently, this viewer watched, for the first time, the 1958 Mexican film "The Vampire's Coffin," in which the Count Lavud--a bloodsucker very much in the traditional, uh, vein--returns to continue his nocturnal depredations. And just last night, for the first time also, I watched another Mexican film dealing with a man who has a decided thirst for blood, Guillermo del Toro's first film as a director, 1993's "Cronos." This latter picture, however, coming 35 years after the other, is anything BUT a traditional vampire tale, and reveals del Toro to be a masterful filmmaker, and a consummate craftsman. Both written and directed by del Toro, "Cronos" must be added to the list of such Great First Horror Films By A Novice Director as Mario Bava's "Black Sunday," George A. Romero's "Night of the Living Dead" and Dario Argento's "The Bird With the Crystal Plumage"; it may not be as seminal a film as any of those earlier three, but it yet bursts with the same manifest imaginative glee and sheer joy of filmmaking; the work of a first-time director anxious to show the world what he is capable of, and succeeding wildly. Unlike the American sci-fi film "Kronos" (1957), which told of an energy-draining alien contraption, "Cronos" tells of a gizmo of a very different nature. In the picture's ubercreepy and fascinating intro, the viewer learns that the Cronos device was constructed by a Spanish alchemist, Uberto Fulcanelli, in 1536; a golden, scarab-shaped construction containing moving gears and a living insect, the device can sprout spiderlike appendages and insert a stinger into its owner, conferring the gift of eternal life. Flash forward 450 years or so, and we meet a kindly, aging antique-store owner, Jesus Gris (Gray Jesus, in other words, and played by Argentinean actor Federico Luppi, who would go on to appear in the del Toro films "The Devil's Backbone" and "Pan's Labyrinth"), who lives with his wife Mercedes (Margarita Isabel) and his strange little granddaughter, Aurora (the remarkable child actress Tamara Shanath). Jesus' antique shop is very much an upscale one--not at all like the Temptations Ltd. emporium that Peter Cushing presides over in 1973's "From Beyond the Grave," to say the least--and, to be succinct, he one day discovers the ancient Cronos device hidden in the base of an archangel statue.

Strangely enough, the film that "Cronos" most brought to mind, as I watched it, was none other than the 1973 American film "Ganja and Hess." In both pictures, a decent man is pierced by an ancient artifact (the dagger of Myrthia, in the earlier film) and becomes a vampire of sorts, although the "V word" is never mentioned in either film; in both films, our transformed man ("Night of the Living Dead"'s Duane Jones, in the earlier picture) is shown daintily and disgustingly lapping up blood off of a floor!

In all, this is a wonderfully self-assured debut for a tyro filmmaker; as del Toro himself puts it, with typical humor and self-deprecation, in one of this DVD's many interview extras, it was "made with absolute, mad, fat-man passion and put out to the world with sincerity and brutal honesty."

    This is not your typical vampire movie. It's a stylistic, beautiful portrayal of the love between a grandfather and his granddaughter. It does new things with the vampire myth and it is the most touching Gothic love story. You can feel that this was a movie made by a man with an explosive imagination and a lot of heart put into what he was making. It is an intelligent and thought provoking film that shows vampires in a different light. This is certainly a great first film that leads into a great career for Guillermo Del Toro. Whether it's foreign films, or mainstream American Hollywood, Del Toro projects visions on the screen of unbelievable creativity and his stories are always sprinkled with a little bit of his childhood.

    This movie reminded me again and again of that cartoon with the vampire and the little girl, where the vampire would not kill the child and the child would not let the vampire go before having a zillion tea parties and tucking her to bed. Of course, the film is a lot richer, full of symbolism, but at the same time maintaining a simplicity that is both refreshing and easy to relate to. The story is OK, but more than that is the Latin American feel of it all and the mix of old music (and people) with a horror theme. Guilermo del Toro was a rookie at that time, but he made a beautiful film, together with long time collaborators Ron Perlman and Federico Luppi. Bottom line: the movie was a little slow paced and the main character both strong and weak in such a human way that it is impossible to not relate to him. The movie is clearly an experiment, as well, filled with great scenes and peppered with strangely unprofessional ones. But it works, it has it's own mood and feel and I recommend it to any horror fan out there.

    In a bid to cheat death, terminally ill millionaire De la Guardia (Claudio Brook) instructs his ruthless nephew Angel (Ron Perlman) to locate The Cronos, a mystical clockwork contraption with the power to bestow immortality on its user. Angel eventually locates the device in the possession of kindly antiques dealer Jesus (Federico Luppi), and resorts to murder to get his hands on the prize; however, having already activated the device, the old man doesn't stay dead for long. With a hunger for blood, an aversion to sunlight, and a rather manky complexion, Jesus breaks into the la Guardia home looking for answers to his bizarre condition. Cronos, the debut movie from Guillermo del Toro, is listed on IMDb as a horror, but it would be much better described as a dark fairytale: although a form of vampirism is at the heart of his script, the writer/director's focus is on Jesus's gradually evolving relationship with his young granddaughter Aurora (Tamara Shanath) and the realisation of a surreal/Gothic fantasy aesthetic. While I don't particularly mind the movie's considered pacinga slow-burn narrative does not faze me one bitand the rich shadowy cinematography is often impressive, I do tend to struggle with the self-consciously quirky, quasi-art-house approach of the type favoured by film-makers such as Jeunet et Caro and Terry Gilliam, finding it all too affected and ostentatious for my taste. Del Toro's style isn't anywhere near as excessive as those particular film-makers can be when they really put their minds to it, but it does result in just enough awkward moments, over-sentimentality and irritating calculated whimsicality to prevent it from being a wholly digestible affair (the dreadfully inappropriate score and the 'comical' mortician being perhaps the film's most notable weaknesses). 5.5/10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb.

    i didn't think this film was as good as del Toro's 'The Devil's Backbone', but it was one of the director's first and it's still scary, disturbing and memorable twenty years later. this film, though produced modestly in Mexico, signals the strong visionary style that del Toro was to eventually become known for. even though made in the 1990's 'Cronos' has the look and feel of horror films from the 1970's and late 60's. most notably the film's of Mario Bava. 'Cronos' is still memorable today because of it's handsome photography and stylish look which elevate it from other low budget horror films from the 90's or any period really. very few horror films look this good or are supplied with this kind of elegance and intelligence. it also still has the ability to scare on a dark night. maybe not as good as the intense 'Devil's Backbone', but still a horror film with more merits than many from the genre in the 90's.

    Guillermo del Toro directed and wrote Cronos, a horror tale which begins in the 1500s with a scientist inventing a device which gives eternal life. A man in current times, Jesus, discovers the magical machine a statue of an archangel. After winding it up, it awakens, grabs him and injects a solution into his arm. The chemical begins to restore his youth but also causes a need for blood. Meanwhile, a wealthy business man has spent years searching for this fountain of youth and attempts to get it from Jesus by any means necessary, including murder, not realizing that Jesus is immortal. The rich man eventually tries to make the Faustian bargain and all is not well that ends well. Del Toros visuals are good but overall result is disappointing when compared with his later masterpiece, Pan's Labyrinth.

    How would you like to live forever? In Guillermo del Toro's Cronos we're given a cryptic look at what can happen when you're granted that wish. Reminiscent of W.W. Jacobs 1902 short story "The Monkey's Paw", Cronos chronicles Jesus Gris's (Federico Luppi) experiences with slowly becoming younger. Jesus is somewhat oblivious as to why this is happening, but he knows it has something to do with a device he found in his antiques store. The Cronos was made by an alchemist in the 1500's, and comes into the possession of Jesus by way of an angel statuette. Strange things start happening after Jesus accidentally activates the Cronos. Possibly worse than the horrid trade off of his newly found rejuvenation, is the consequence of owning such a device. Bad man want the Cronos, and will go to any lengths to get it. For the sake of his family, and most importantly the safety of his granddaughter Aurora (Tamara Shanath), Jesus must decide what to do when he is faced with an ultimatum. Will he choose wisely? In this dark fantasy film, that borders on horror, del Toro offers us an amazingly suspenseful and eerily entertaining look at the power of greed. There are a few similarities between this and Pan's Labyrinth, especially the creepy imagery juxtaposed with the innocence of a young girl. I highly enjoyed this picture, but will admit that it is no Pan's Labyrinth. However it is a great film in its own right. It's classified as a horror, but I find it to be more of a dark fantasy. Very artistic scenes and beautiful imagery, definitely worth a watch!
