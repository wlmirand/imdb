    When I first heard of this movie I was intrigued by the title - it, in my own weird way, thought it was clever. It looked cute, and a few friends said that it was funny, so I could not resist watching it. One complaint though is that the video cover is not as good as the movie poster, where they had Bill Murry pointing an oversized gun out at you. The movie is about a naive man, Wallace Ritchie, who comes to London to surprise his brother, but must be occupied for the night as his brother has an important dinner. So his brother enrolls him in something called the theatre of life, where the audience participates in the action. Unfortunately Wallace picks up the wrong phone call and gets caught up in a cloak and dagger mission, which he believes is all acting. The comedy from this movie comes from two areas: in one way it is slap-stick, but the real thrust of the comedy is the fact the people do not know something, yet assume that they do. They do not know who Wallace is and think that he is a dangerous spy, yet he is just an ordinary guy. What adds to it is that Wallace was mugged at the beginning so he has no identification, yet they think even more that he is a spy. What is even funnier is that Wallace thinks he is simply in an interactive theatre, and treats it as such. While all of this seriousness goes on around him, he seems to be having the time of his life. Even more, Ritchie's clumsiness gets him out of a lot of predicaments and makes the bad guys think even more that he is a dangerous spy. I really enjoyed this movie. Most comedies I do not find funny, but once in a while one comes out that is quite funny (though some are simply pure hilarity, such as Analyse This!). This is a humorous (though not outrageously funny) comedy.

    THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE Well... this is not as good as I was hoping it was going to be, but I still enjoyed it. This comedy stars the legendary Bill Murray, which is the reason I watched it. The movie is about an American who comes to the UK to visit his brother, but he comes on a bad day so his brother pays for him to act in a reality show that night playing out some kind of adventure. The problem is, he goes on the wrong adventure, and the things that are happening to him are all real, but he doesn't realise it. There are some funny bits in it... I love the scene where Bill gets mugged but he thinks it is all part of the act and plays along. There were not too many laugh out loud moments, but the film was still very amusing. The casting was good, but the acting was questionable. But this is a spoof, so we can't expect any fantastic acting. It was what was expected really. The film stars Bill Murray as mentioned before, Peter Gallagher, Joanne Whalley & Mr. Victor Meldrew himself... Richard Wilson. I know what you are thinking... "I don't believe it!" The movie was well written and flows along nicely. I will give this film 6 out of 10. Not as funny as it could have been, but still a good film.

    The Man Who Knew Too Little is an alright movie with a surprisingly clever story line and a great performance from Bill Murray,but a lot of the humor is very hit and miss,and probably misses more commonly than it hits,although I will admit when it does hit it is very funny.I was very confused watching this movie who the target audience was,because a lot of the humor was very childish,but what happens in the movie and a lot of scenes aren't very suitable for children,its probably meant for the family,but I would advise any overprotective parent to view this movie before viewing it with their children. Wallace Ritchie (Bill Murray) gets involved with spy's who are assassinating a private event,but Wallace thinks it is all a theater act and must stay in character.

    Peter Gallagher is an ambitious businessman in London, trying to put together a big international deal to market his product. He invites his goofy brother, Murray, over as a guest and tells him he'll be taking part in "The Theater of Life," which will consist of a series of auditions and improvised incidents that may lead to a part in a play. Something like that. It's like Michael Douglas' "The Game" turned inside out. This is a fantasy, built around a single joke -- Murray's belief that it's all part of a game. He continues to believe it throughout the movie, even to the end. The first inopportune occurrences are minor ones. Two British thugs attempt to rob him at knife point. Murray responds by chuckling and complimenting them on their ability to really get into the role. Then he's swept up coincidentally into a plot by British and Russian agents who long for the good old days of the Cold War, when all the spies were busy and the phones rang all the time. They plan to assassinate the Russian and British leaders who are about to sign a Friendship Pact. Murray is misidentified as a secret agent assigned to stop them. The contretemps pile up, one upon the other, and Murray blindly stumbles through it all. If a pistol appears, he's likely to say something like, "Uh-oh, a sign of realism, eh? Very impressive. No, really." The caricature of reality resembles that of Peter Sellers' "Being There," the story of an almost infinitely stupid ex-gardener who only knows what he's seen on television but is taken to be a Deep Thinker and winds up being considered for nomination for the President of the United States. "Being There" had its silly moments but was funnier because the lines were better and because it carried a certain sting with it. How stupid can you be before you are recognized as less than presidential material? Here, the jokes involve much more slapstick and the misguided premise itself is sort of worn out by the end. Murray winds up at a big party, dressed as a Russian dancer, jiggling a live bomb. The writers kept forging ahead although the story was going nowhere. Not that it doesn't have its share of laughs. I'm not sure the writers realized it but they've introduced a kind of psychological approach to therapy based on the "life as theater" model. There's no place to get into role playing. Anyone interested should Google Milton Erikson. I'll give an example of how taken-for-granted the scrips that we live are. It's a real example. A Los Angeles police officer pulled over a driver for a minor violation. The driver was African-American and it was a black neighborhood. As the cop examined the driver's credentials and busied himself with writing a ticket, a crowd gathered, slowly growing angrier at yet more police harassment of blacks. Soon the lone cop was surrounded by a muttering mob and the threat of violence hung in the air. The script at this point called for the cop to unclip his revolver and order the crowd to disperse. Instead, he turned and waved a copy of the traffic ticket above his head, shouting, "You have just witnessed an exercise of law enforcement in the city of Los Angeles!" While the crowd puzzled over this announcement ("What did he say?"), the officer got into his car and drove quietly away. Neither Murray nor anyone else knew quite was they were tapping into when they casually threw around terms like "Living Theater" and "Life as Theater." It really IS, in many ways. For more of THAT, read Kenneth Burke or Erving Goffman.

    The Man Who Knew Too Little is a movie based on a book by Robert Farrar, and it's one of those timeless comedies with phenomenal script and even better acting. I must say that Bill Murray was hilarious in this one, and this is one of his best comedic roles. The script is very original and unique, giving the director and actors enough material to create a comedy that has several layers and can be viewed as classical slapstick but also an intelligent comedy. Combining a serious spy plot with a hapless and accident-prone "secret agent" is something that now is quite popular, but back in 1997 was a genre less explored. Toying with the cold war, and stereotypes common for James Bond movies Farrar creates even more comedy, and a perfect example is Boris The Butcher, played masterfully by Alfred Mollina. Wallace Ritchie is a manager at a Blockbuster video store in America, and he has come to England to visit his businessman brother James. But this is a wrong time for a visit since James is expecting an important business partner at his house so he offers Ritchie a ticket to "Theater Of Life" a new kind of show where a viewer participates along with the actors in a show. All too happy, Ritchie accepts the offer, not knowing that soon he will be involved in a spy war of immense proportions. Thinking that this is still a show and that everything is supposed to happen like that Ritchie plays along, as he tries to save the world in his world and in real world...

    A Bill Murray vehicle which is all over the road. Pee Wee Herman would have made a better secret agent. The writers pulled out all the B movie plots to write this. Bill Murray "Secret Agent" in London, falls into a "secret plot" to kill some Prime Minister.A Call girl to the British Defense Minister has "secret letters" that means absolutely nothing to anyone. Russian "secret" agents grab Murray and hold him for something.Scotland yard is looking for Bill Murray who are as competent as Pee Wee Herman finding his Bicycle at the Alamo.The British Secret Service agents are older then the Queen. There is a summit between Russian,British,German,American Embassadors and absolutely no security at a Hotel in London. Meanwhile Russian agents want to torture Bill Murray for some unknown and stupid reason kind of like the three stooges.Anyway an old Gezzer couple dressed in leather are performing S&M acts,absolutely hideous script.What moron wrote this movie. ?Why would any good actor agree to appear in this movie.It states that it cost $20,000,000 to make this movie. unless I read this wrong.It grossed like $10,000,000 worldwide.

    The Man Who Knew Too Little (1997) There are those who think Bill Murray can do no wrong, that he has an impeccable comic flair and intelligence that drive even mediocre fare. And I'm one of them. And this is relatively humdrum stuff on one level--though the basic idea of spoofing a spy superstar is as old and reliable as James Bond himself. (I mean, Bond spoofs were around when Sean Connery was still 007.) And the writing is really very witty here, giving two prongs forward in this mostly funny, always fast affair. That is--I laughed a lot! That's the goal. The cold war themes of the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. going head to head were old even in 1997 but of course not old for James Bond, and this does harken back somehow to the original. Murray plays a classic type--the hero who succeeds by accident. Often, it's the absurdity and illogic of this odd hero that makes him successful, surprising the professionals and seeming brazen and original. And so he is. The plot is simple--some bad guys have a bomb that's going to go off in five hours. We know that at the start, and so the rest is loaded with anticipation and dread as the deadline nears. We also know (in this sort of movie) that no harm will come to Murray's cheerful, doltish American type. So the race against the clock is a series of gags and spoofs and lucky twists, all good for laughs. Murray is the key to it all, playing the naive participant with that uncanny timing and innocent face too well, over and over. If it were only about Murry this would be a 10 star masterpiece. The rest of the cast, and the eventual inevitability of the plot, hold it back, though. So it is what it is, still a great romp. You want more than that? You won't get it. But why would you? Enjoy.

    This is one enjoyable comedy for sure. "A" for that script. It managed to create a long chain of nice misunderstandings, including the many double-meaning words. And I liked intensifying all the hot events in about 2 hours of one night. The thing about the anti-James Bond is that he represents us; all the clumsy wanna-be heroes out there. So when the movie celebrates his always accidental victory, winning the respect and the fear from everybody, we feel so relieved, turning into heroes ourselves, since one of us DID IT, and purely by his / our clumsiness, to leave the movie a bit proud of our low capacities and sheer innocence, believing  even if spuriously  that someday we'll save the world as much as god is on our side, and some scriptwriters as well ! However, the script forgot to explain what the fact around the woman / the minster's mistress was ? What the need for those letters could be ? And I thought the relationship between the lead and his brother could have been rooted better, to present some kind of a meaning at last, concerning the importance of being careless and adventurous more than uptight and narrow-minded. Speaking about "careless" pushes immediately to (Bill Murray). I love such a guy. He plays everything with a trademark sweet coolness. Look at him fooling around as a Russian dancer who, by his axiomatic fun, excels the rest of the serious authentic dancers. No one I remember can do such a scene with a serene lovely sense but (Murray). He's the easygoing friend that everybody wishes for. So, another "A" for the lead actor. The minor parts weren't done as good. I mean (Peter Gallagher) as the brother ?! Where was (Jon Lovitz) for god's sake ? Then (Joanne Whalley) ?? She's totally miscast. I don't know how they didn't come up with any funny, any sexy other actress ?! It's only (Alfred Molina) who was great as the professional "butcher"; with the double meaning of the word ! The movie suffers from a small size budget. With another sum of money this should have been more powerful and dazzling. And (Jon Amiel)'s direction didn't help much mastering a powerful and dazzling image in the first place. Well, this is a kind of James Bond spoof, so be at least a bit big or colorful instead of looking like something shot in a very tight rooms ! This is dazzling at heart movie. Because outwardly it's near to poor TV. But anyway, with that script and that lead, not much can go wrong.

    Maybe this was not one of the best movies, or best loved movies(I noticed it lost quite a bit at the box office), but I laughed almost all the way through this. Laughing, I found out early on is somewhat prohibitive in movie theaters, and of course the person next to you wants to hear what's going on. A lot is going on in this comedy, and I happened to like Joanna Whaley a lot in her French Maid. But, if you did not think the flick was all that hot itself, or anyone, an idea might be to watch the movie again and try to notice only Bill Murray. Think about it, he is acting in a movie where he assumes that he is in a contrived situation. The SNL actor is so completely believable, and his character and everybody else's character is supported by a pretty involved script. The whole comedy is worthwhile if you can watch in an unprotracted manner. I have a habit of seeing some highly acclaimed movies in parts. Yet I watched this all the way through without a break. The plot is not anything new by itself, that is the the plot the criminals have in the heart of London. But then the idea of this sort of thick but spontaneous movie rental employee being involved in there makes the picture unique.

    Bill Murray has made a lot of brilliant art, from Caddyshack to Rushmore to Lost in Translation. This, I think, is his funniest work. He plays an idiot savant who is fearless, who plays games of life and death because he thinks it's a game. What makes this whole movie seem like a high-wire act is whether Murray will discover that his life really is in danger. If he makes this discovery, his confidence will be shattered and he will fall to pieces. It's a hysterical and brilliant riff on male confidence and male delusion. It's an ode to the power of innocence. He is oblivious to all the bad in the world. He's unaware of his own vulnerability. Compare the sweaty James Bond to the cool and nonchalant Bill Murray. It's like zen for morons. It's hysterical when you watch it and brilliant when you think about it. Taylor Carmichael

    A Bill Murray vehicle which is all over the road. Pee Wee Herman would have made a better secret agent. The writers pulled out all the B movie plots to write this. Bill Murray "Secret Agent" in London, falls into a "secret plot" to kill some Prime Minister.A Call girl to the British Defense Minister has "secret letters" that means absolutely nothing to anyone. Russian "secret" agents grab Murray and hold him for something.Scotland yard is looking for Bill Murray who are as competent as Pee Wee Herman finding his Bicycle at the Alamo.The British Secret Service agents are older then the Queen. There is a summit between Russian,British,German,American Embassadors and absolutely no security at a Hotel in London. Meanwhile Russian agents want to torture Bill Murray for some unknown and stupid reason kind of like the three stooges.Anyway an old Gezzer couple dressed in leather are performing S&M acts,absolutely hideous script.What moron wrote this movie. ?Why would any good actor agree to appear in this movie.It states that it cost $20,000,000 to make this movie. unless I read this wrong.It grossed like $10,000,000 worldwide.

    The Man Who Knew Too Little (1997) There are those who think Bill Murray can do no wrong, that he has an impeccable comic flair and intelligence that drive even mediocre fare. And I'm one of them. And this is relatively humdrum stuff on one level--though the basic idea of spoofing a spy superstar is as old and reliable as James Bond himself. (I mean, Bond spoofs were around when Sean Connery was still 007.) And the writing is really very witty here, giving two prongs forward in this mostly funny, always fast affair. That is--I laughed a lot! That's the goal. The cold war themes of the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. going head to head were old even in 1997 but of course not old for James Bond, and this does harken back somehow to the original. Murray plays a classic type--the hero who succeeds by accident. Often, it's the absurdity and illogic of this odd hero that makes him successful, surprising the professionals and seeming brazen and original. And so he is. The plot is simple--some bad guys have a bomb that's going to go off in five hours. We know that at the start, and so the rest is loaded with anticipation and dread as the deadline nears. We also know (in this sort of movie) that no harm will come to Murray's cheerful, doltish American type. So the race against the clock is a series of gags and spoofs and lucky twists, all good for laughs. Murray is the key to it all, playing the naive participant with that uncanny timing and innocent face too well, over and over. If it were only about Murry this would be a 10 star masterpiece. The rest of the cast, and the eventual inevitability of the plot, hold it back, though. So it is what it is, still a great romp. You want more than that? You won't get it. But why would you? Enjoy.

    This is one enjoyable comedy for sure. "A" for that script. It managed to create a long chain of nice misunderstandings, including the many double-meaning words. And I liked intensifying all the hot events in about 2 hours of one night. The thing about the anti-James Bond is that he represents us; all the clumsy wanna-be heroes out there. So when the movie celebrates his always accidental victory, winning the respect and the fear from everybody, we feel so relieved, turning into heroes ourselves, since one of us DID IT, and purely by his / our clumsiness, to leave the movie a bit proud of our low capacities and sheer innocence, believing  even if spuriously  that someday we'll save the world as much as god is on our side, and some scriptwriters as well ! However, the script forgot to explain what the fact around the woman / the minster's mistress was ? What the need for those letters could be ? And I thought the relationship between the lead and his brother could have been rooted better, to present some kind of a meaning at last, concerning the importance of being careless and adventurous more than uptight and narrow-minded. Speaking about "careless" pushes immediately to (Bill Murray). I love such a guy. He plays everything with a trademark sweet coolness. Look at him fooling around as a Russian dancer who, by his axiomatic fun, excels the rest of the serious authentic dancers. No one I remember can do such a scene with a serene lovely sense but (Murray). He's the easygoing friend that everybody wishes for. So, another "A" for the lead actor. The minor parts weren't done as good. I mean (Peter Gallagher) as the brother ?! Where was (Jon Lovitz) for god's sake ? Then (Joanne Whalley) ?? She's totally miscast. I don't know how they didn't come up with any funny, any sexy other actress ?! It's only (Alfred Molina) who was great as the professional "butcher"; with the double meaning of the word ! The movie suffers from a small size budget. With another sum of money this should have been more powerful and dazzling. And (Jon Amiel)'s direction didn't help much mastering a powerful and dazzling image in the first place. Well, this is a kind of James Bond spoof, so be at least a bit big or colorful instead of looking like something shot in a very tight rooms ! This is dazzling at heart movie. Because outwardly it's near to poor TV. But anyway, with that script and that lead, not much can go wrong.

    Maybe this was not one of the best movies, or best loved movies(I noticed it lost quite a bit at the box office), but I laughed almost all the way through this. Laughing, I found out early on is somewhat prohibitive in movie theaters, and of course the person next to you wants to hear what's going on. A lot is going on in this comedy, and I happened to like Joanna Whaley a lot in her French Maid. But, if you did not think the flick was all that hot itself, or anyone, an idea might be to watch the movie again and try to notice only Bill Murray. Think about it, he is acting in a movie where he assumes that he is in a contrived situation. The SNL actor is so completely believable, and his character and everybody else's character is supported by a pretty involved script. The whole comedy is worthwhile if you can watch in an unprotracted manner. I have a habit of seeing some highly acclaimed movies in parts. Yet I watched this all the way through without a break. The plot is not anything new by itself, that is the the plot the criminals have in the heart of London. But then the idea of this sort of thick but spontaneous movie rental employee being involved in there makes the picture unique.

    Bill Murray has made a lot of brilliant art, from Caddyshack to Rushmore to Lost in Translation. This, I think, is his funniest work. He plays an idiot savant who is fearless, who plays games of life and death because he thinks it's a game. What makes this whole movie seem like a high-wire act is whether Murray will discover that his life really is in danger. If he makes this discovery, his confidence will be shattered and he will fall to pieces. It's a hysterical and brilliant riff on male confidence and male delusion. It's an ode to the power of innocence. He is oblivious to all the bad in the world. He's unaware of his own vulnerability. Compare the sweaty James Bond to the cool and nonchalant Bill Murray. It's like zen for morons. It's hysterical when you watch it and brilliant when you think about it. Taylor Carmichael

    When I first heard of this movie I was intrigued by the title - it, in my own weird way, thought it was clever. It looked cute, and a few friends said that it was funny, so I could not resist watching it. One complaint though is that the video cover is not as good as the movie poster, where they had Bill Murry pointing an oversized gun out at you. The movie is about a naive man, Wallace Ritchie, who comes to London to surprise his brother, but must be occupied for the night as his brother has an important dinner. So his brother enrolls him in something called the theatre of life, where the audience participates in the action. Unfortunately Wallace picks up the wrong phone call and gets caught up in a cloak and dagger mission, which he believes is all acting. The comedy from this movie comes from two areas: in one way it is slap-stick, but the real thrust of the comedy is the fact the people do not know something, yet assume that they do. They do not know who Wallace is and think that he is a dangerous spy, yet he is just an ordinary guy. What adds to it is that Wallace was mugged at the beginning so he has no identification, yet they think even more that he is a spy. What is even funnier is that Wallace thinks he is simply in an interactive theatre, and treats it as such. While all of this seriousness goes on around him, he seems to be having the time of his life. Even more, Ritchie's clumsiness gets him out of a lot of predicaments and makes the bad guys think even more that he is a dangerous spy. I really enjoyed this movie. Most comedies I do not find funny, but once in a while one comes out that is quite funny (though some are simply pure hilarity, such as Analyse This!). This is a humorous (though not outrageously funny) comedy.

    THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE Well... this is not as good as I was hoping it was going to be, but I still enjoyed it. This comedy stars the legendary Bill Murray, which is the reason I watched it. The movie is about an American who comes to the UK to visit his brother, but he comes on a bad day so his brother pays for him to act in a reality show that night playing out some kind of adventure. The problem is, he goes on the wrong adventure, and the things that are happening to him are all real, but he doesn't realise it. There are some funny bits in it... I love the scene where Bill gets mugged but he thinks it is all part of the act and plays along. There were not too many laugh out loud moments, but the film was still very amusing. The casting was good, but the acting was questionable. But this is a spoof, so we can't expect any fantastic acting. It was what was expected really. The film stars Bill Murray as mentioned before, Peter Gallagher, Joanne Whalley & Mr. Victor Meldrew himself... Richard Wilson. I know what you are thinking... "I don't believe it!" The movie was well written and flows along nicely. I will give this film 6 out of 10. Not as funny as it could have been, but still a good film.

    The Man Who Knew Too Little is an alright movie with a surprisingly clever story line and a great performance from Bill Murray,but a lot of the humor is very hit and miss,and probably misses more commonly than it hits,although I will admit when it does hit it is very funny.I was very confused watching this movie who the target audience was,because a lot of the humor was very childish,but what happens in the movie and a lot of scenes aren't very suitable for children,its probably meant for the family,but I would advise any overprotective parent to view this movie before viewing it with their children. Wallace Ritchie (Bill Murray) gets involved with spy's who are assassinating a private event,but Wallace thinks it is all a theater act and must stay in character.

    Peter Gallagher is an ambitious businessman in London, trying to put together a big international deal to market his product. He invites his goofy brother, Murray, over as a guest and tells him he'll be taking part in "The Theater of Life," which will consist of a series of auditions and improvised incidents that may lead to a part in a play. Something like that. It's like Michael Douglas' "The Game" turned inside out. This is a fantasy, built around a single joke -- Murray's belief that it's all part of a game. He continues to believe it throughout the movie, even to the end. The first inopportune occurrences are minor ones. Two British thugs attempt to rob him at knife point. Murray responds by chuckling and complimenting them on their ability to really get into the role. Then he's swept up coincidentally into a plot by British and Russian agents who long for the good old days of the Cold War, when all the spies were busy and the phones rang all the time. They plan to assassinate the Russian and British leaders who are about to sign a Friendship Pact. Murray is misidentified as a secret agent assigned to stop them. The contretemps pile up, one upon the other, and Murray blindly stumbles through it all. If a pistol appears, he's likely to say something like, "Uh-oh, a sign of realism, eh? Very impressive. No, really." The caricature of reality resembles that of Peter Sellers' "Being There," the story of an almost infinitely stupid ex-gardener who only knows what he's seen on television but is taken to be a Deep Thinker and winds up being considered for nomination for the President of the United States. "Being There" had its silly moments but was funnier because the lines were better and because it carried a certain sting with it. How stupid can you be before you are recognized as less than presidential material? Here, the jokes involve much more slapstick and the misguided premise itself is sort of worn out by the end. Murray winds up at a big party, dressed as a Russian dancer, jiggling a live bomb. The writers kept forging ahead although the story was going nowhere. Not that it doesn't have its share of laughs. I'm not sure the writers realized it but they've introduced a kind of psychological approach to therapy based on the "life as theater" model. There's no place to get into role playing. Anyone interested should Google Milton Erikson. I'll give an example of how taken-for-granted the scrips that we live are. It's a real example. A Los Angeles police officer pulled over a driver for a minor violation. The driver was African-American and it was a black neighborhood. As the cop examined the driver's credentials and busied himself with writing a ticket, a crowd gathered, slowly growing angrier at yet more police harassment of blacks. Soon the lone cop was surrounded by a muttering mob and the threat of violence hung in the air. The script at this point called for the cop to unclip his revolver and order the crowd to disperse. Instead, he turned and waved a copy of the traffic ticket above his head, shouting, "You have just witnessed an exercise of law enforcement in the city of Los Angeles!" While the crowd puzzled over this announcement ("What did he say?"), the officer got into his car and drove quietly away. Neither Murray nor anyone else knew quite was they were tapping into when they casually threw around terms like "Living Theater" and "Life as Theater." It really IS, in many ways. For more of THAT, read Kenneth Burke or Erving Goffman.

    The Man Who Knew Too Little is a movie based on a book by Robert Farrar, and it's one of those timeless comedies with phenomenal script and even better acting. I must say that Bill Murray was hilarious in this one, and this is one of his best comedic roles. The script is very original and unique, giving the director and actors enough material to create a comedy that has several layers and can be viewed as classical slapstick but also an intelligent comedy. Combining a serious spy plot with a hapless and accident-prone "secret agent" is something that now is quite popular, but back in 1997 was a genre less explored. Toying with the cold war, and stereotypes common for James Bond movies Farrar creates even more comedy, and a perfect example is Boris The Butcher, played masterfully by Alfred Mollina. Wallace Ritchie is a manager at a Blockbuster video store in America, and he has come to England to visit his businessman brother James. But this is a wrong time for a visit since James is expecting an important business partner at his house so he offers Ritchie a ticket to "Theater Of Life" a new kind of show where a viewer participates along with the actors in a show. All too happy, Ritchie accepts the offer, not knowing that soon he will be involved in a spy war of immense proportions. Thinking that this is still a show and that everything is supposed to happen like that Ritchie plays along, as he tries to save the world in his world and in real world...

    The Man Who Knew Too Little is an alright movie with a surprisingly clever story line and a great performance from Bill Murray,but a lot of the humor is very hit and miss,and probably misses more commonly than it hits,although I will admit when it does hit it is very funny.I was very confused watching this movie who the target audience was,because a lot of the humor was very childish,but what happens in the movie and a lot of scenes aren't very suitable for children,its probably meant for the family,but I would advise any overprotective parent to view this movie before viewing it with their children. Wallace Ritchie (Bill Murray) gets involved with spy's who are assassinating a private event,but Wallace thinks it is all a theater act and must stay in character.

    Peter Gallagher is an ambitious businessman in London, trying to put together a big international deal to market his product. He invites his goofy brother, Murray, over as a guest and tells him he'll be taking part in "The Theater of Life," which will consist of a series of auditions and improvised incidents that may lead to a part in a play. Something like that. It's like Michael Douglas' "The Game" turned inside out. This is a fantasy, built around a single joke -- Murray's belief that it's all part of a game. He continues to believe it throughout the movie, even to the end. The first inopportune occurrences are minor ones. Two British thugs attempt to rob him at knife point. Murray responds by chuckling and complimenting them on their ability to really get into the role. Then he's swept up coincidentally into a plot by British and Russian agents who long for the good old days of the Cold War, when all the spies were busy and the phones rang all the time. They plan to assassinate the Russian and British leaders who are about to sign a Friendship Pact. Murray is misidentified as a secret agent assigned to stop them. The contretemps pile up, one upon the other, and Murray blindly stumbles through it all. If a pistol appears, he's likely to say something like, "Uh-oh, a sign of realism, eh? Very impressive. No, really." The caricature of reality resembles that of Peter Sellers' "Being There," the story of an almost infinitely stupid ex-gardener who only knows what he's seen on television but is taken to be a Deep Thinker and winds up being considered for nomination for the President of the United States. "Being There" had its silly moments but was funnier because the lines were better and because it carried a certain sting with it. How stupid can you be before you are recognized as less than presidential material? Here, the jokes involve much more slapstick and the misguided premise itself is sort of worn out by the end. Murray winds up at a big party, dressed as a Russian dancer, jiggling a live bomb. The writers kept forging ahead although the story was going nowhere. Not that it doesn't have its share of laughs. I'm not sure the writers realized it but they've introduced a kind of psychological approach to therapy based on the "life as theater" model. There's no place to get into role playing. Anyone interested should Google Milton Erikson. I'll give an example of how taken-for-granted the scrips that we live are. It's a real example. A Los Angeles police officer pulled over a driver for a minor violation. The driver was African-American and it was a black neighborhood. As the cop examined the driver's credentials and busied himself with writing a ticket, a crowd gathered, slowly growing angrier at yet more police harassment of blacks. Soon the lone cop was surrounded by a muttering mob and the threat of violence hung in the air. The script at this point called for the cop to unclip his revolver and order the crowd to disperse. Instead, he turned and waved a copy of the traffic ticket above his head, shouting, "You have just witnessed an exercise of law enforcement in the city of Los Angeles!" While the crowd puzzled over this announcement ("What did he say?"), the officer got into his car and drove quietly away. Neither Murray nor anyone else knew quite was they were tapping into when they casually threw around terms like "Living Theater" and "Life as Theater." It really IS, in many ways. For more of THAT, read Kenneth Burke or Erving Goffman.

    The Man Who Knew Too Little is a movie based on a book by Robert Farrar, and it's one of those timeless comedies with phenomenal script and even better acting. I must say that Bill Murray was hilarious in this one, and this is one of his best comedic roles. The script is very original and unique, giving the director and actors enough material to create a comedy that has several layers and can be viewed as classical slapstick but also an intelligent comedy. Combining a serious spy plot with a hapless and accident-prone "secret agent" is something that now is quite popular, but back in 1997 was a genre less explored. Toying with the cold war, and stereotypes common for James Bond movies Farrar creates even more comedy, and a perfect example is Boris The Butcher, played masterfully by Alfred Mollina. Wallace Ritchie is a manager at a Blockbuster video store in America, and he has come to England to visit his businessman brother James. But this is a wrong time for a visit since James is expecting an important business partner at his house so he offers Ritchie a ticket to "Theater Of Life" a new kind of show where a viewer participates along with the actors in a show. All too happy, Ritchie accepts the offer, not knowing that soon he will be involved in a spy war of immense proportions. Thinking that this is still a show and that everything is supposed to happen like that Ritchie plays along, as he tries to save the world in his world and in real world...

    A Bill Murray vehicle which is all over the road. Pee Wee Herman would have made a better secret agent. The writers pulled out all the B movie plots to write this. Bill Murray "Secret Agent" in London, falls into a "secret plot" to kill some Prime Minister.A Call girl to the British Defense Minister has "secret letters" that means absolutely nothing to anyone. Russian "secret" agents grab Murray and hold him for something.Scotland yard is looking for Bill Murray who are as competent as Pee Wee Herman finding his Bicycle at the Alamo.The British Secret Service agents are older then the Queen. There is a summit between Russian,British,German,American Embassadors and absolutely no security at a Hotel in London. Meanwhile Russian agents want to torture Bill Murray for some unknown and stupid reason kind of like the three stooges.Anyway an old Gezzer couple dressed in leather are performing S&M acts,absolutely hideous script.What moron wrote this movie. ?Why would any good actor agree to appear in this movie.It states that it cost $20,000,000 to make this movie. unless I read this wrong.It grossed like $10,000,000 worldwide.

    The Man Who Knew Too Little (1997) There are those who think Bill Murray can do no wrong, that he has an impeccable comic flair and intelligence that drive even mediocre fare. And I'm one of them. And this is relatively humdrum stuff on one level--though the basic idea of spoofing a spy superstar is as old and reliable as James Bond himself. (I mean, Bond spoofs were around when Sean Connery was still 007.) And the writing is really very witty here, giving two prongs forward in this mostly funny, always fast affair. That is--I laughed a lot! That's the goal. The cold war themes of the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. going head to head were old even in 1997 but of course not old for James Bond, and this does harken back somehow to the original. Murray plays a classic type--the hero who succeeds by accident. Often, it's the absurdity and illogic of this odd hero that makes him successful, surprising the professionals and seeming brazen and original. And so he is. The plot is simple--some bad guys have a bomb that's going to go off in five hours. We know that at the start, and so the rest is loaded with anticipation and dread as the deadline nears. We also know (in this sort of movie) that no harm will come to Murray's cheerful, doltish American type. So the race against the clock is a series of gags and spoofs and lucky twists, all good for laughs. Murray is the key to it all, playing the naive participant with that uncanny timing and innocent face too well, over and over. If it were only about Murry this would be a 10 star masterpiece. The rest of the cast, and the eventual inevitability of the plot, hold it back, though. So it is what it is, still a great romp. You want more than that? You won't get it. But why would you? Enjoy.

    This is one enjoyable comedy for sure. "A" for that script. It managed to create a long chain of nice misunderstandings, including the many double-meaning words. And I liked intensifying all the hot events in about 2 hours of one night. The thing about the anti-James Bond is that he represents us; all the clumsy wanna-be heroes out there. So when the movie celebrates his always accidental victory, winning the respect and the fear from everybody, we feel so relieved, turning into heroes ourselves, since one of us DID IT, and purely by his / our clumsiness, to leave the movie a bit proud of our low capacities and sheer innocence, believing  even if spuriously  that someday we'll save the world as much as god is on our side, and some scriptwriters as well ! However, the script forgot to explain what the fact around the woman / the minster's mistress was ? What the need for those letters could be ? And I thought the relationship between the lead and his brother could have been rooted better, to present some kind of a meaning at last, concerning the importance of being careless and adventurous more than uptight and narrow-minded. Speaking about "careless" pushes immediately to (Bill Murray). I love such a guy. He plays everything with a trademark sweet coolness. Look at him fooling around as a Russian dancer who, by his axiomatic fun, excels the rest of the serious authentic dancers. No one I remember can do such a scene with a serene lovely sense but (Murray). He's the easygoing friend that everybody wishes for. So, another "A" for the lead actor. The minor parts weren't done as good. I mean (Peter Gallagher) as the brother ?! Where was (Jon Lovitz) for god's sake ? Then (Joanne Whalley) ?? She's totally miscast. I don't know how they didn't come up with any funny, any sexy other actress ?! It's only (Alfred Molina) who was great as the professional "butcher"; with the double meaning of the word ! The movie suffers from a small size budget. With another sum of money this should have been more powerful and dazzling. And (Jon Amiel)'s direction didn't help much mastering a powerful and dazzling image in the first place. Well, this is a kind of James Bond spoof, so be at least a bit big or colorful instead of looking like something shot in a very tight rooms ! This is dazzling at heart movie. Because outwardly it's near to poor TV. But anyway, with that script and that lead, not much can go wrong.

    Maybe this was not one of the best movies, or best loved movies(I noticed it lost quite a bit at the box office), but I laughed almost all the way through this. Laughing, I found out early on is somewhat prohibitive in movie theaters, and of course the person next to you wants to hear what's going on. A lot is going on in this comedy, and I happened to like Joanna Whaley a lot in her French Maid. But, if you did not think the flick was all that hot itself, or anyone, an idea might be to watch the movie again and try to notice only Bill Murray. Think about it, he is acting in a movie where he assumes that he is in a contrived situation. The SNL actor is so completely believable, and his character and everybody else's character is supported by a pretty involved script. The whole comedy is worthwhile if you can watch in an unprotracted manner. I have a habit of seeing some highly acclaimed movies in parts. Yet I watched this all the way through without a break. The plot is not anything new by itself, that is the the plot the criminals have in the heart of London. But then the idea of this sort of thick but spontaneous movie rental employee being involved in there makes the picture unique.

    Bill Murray has made a lot of brilliant art, from Caddyshack to Rushmore to Lost in Translation. This, I think, is his funniest work. He plays an idiot savant who is fearless, who plays games of life and death because he thinks it's a game. What makes this whole movie seem like a high-wire act is whether Murray will discover that his life really is in danger. If he makes this discovery, his confidence will be shattered and he will fall to pieces. It's a hysterical and brilliant riff on male confidence and male delusion. It's an ode to the power of innocence. He is oblivious to all the bad in the world. He's unaware of his own vulnerability. Compare the sweaty James Bond to the cool and nonchalant Bill Murray. It's like zen for morons. It's hysterical when you watch it and brilliant when you think about it. Taylor Carmichael

    When I first heard of this movie I was intrigued by the title - it, in my own weird way, thought it was clever. It looked cute, and a few friends said that it was funny, so I could not resist watching it. One complaint though is that the video cover is not as good as the movie poster, where they had Bill Murry pointing an oversized gun out at you. The movie is about a naive man, Wallace Ritchie, who comes to London to surprise his brother, but must be occupied for the night as his brother has an important dinner. So his brother enrolls him in something called the theatre of life, where the audience participates in the action. Unfortunately Wallace picks up the wrong phone call and gets caught up in a cloak and dagger mission, which he believes is all acting. The comedy from this movie comes from two areas: in one way it is slap-stick, but the real thrust of the comedy is the fact the people do not know something, yet assume that they do. They do not know who Wallace is and think that he is a dangerous spy, yet he is just an ordinary guy. What adds to it is that Wallace was mugged at the beginning so he has no identification, yet they think even more that he is a spy. What is even funnier is that Wallace thinks he is simply in an interactive theatre, and treats it as such. While all of this seriousness goes on around him, he seems to be having the time of his life. Even more, Ritchie's clumsiness gets him out of a lot of predicaments and makes the bad guys think even more that he is a dangerous spy. I really enjoyed this movie. Most comedies I do not find funny, but once in a while one comes out that is quite funny (though some are simply pure hilarity, such as Analyse This!). This is a humorous (though not outrageously funny) comedy.

    THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE Well... this is not as good as I was hoping it was going to be, but I still enjoyed it. This comedy stars the legendary Bill Murray, which is the reason I watched it. The movie is about an American who comes to the UK to visit his brother, but he comes on a bad day so his brother pays for him to act in a reality show that night playing out some kind of adventure. The problem is, he goes on the wrong adventure, and the things that are happening to him are all real, but he doesn't realise it. There are some funny bits in it... I love the scene where Bill gets mugged but he thinks it is all part of the act and plays along. There were not too many laugh out loud moments, but the film was still very amusing. The casting was good, but the acting was questionable. But this is a spoof, so we can't expect any fantastic acting. It was what was expected really. The film stars Bill Murray as mentioned before, Peter Gallagher, Joanne Whalley & Mr. Victor Meldrew himself... Richard Wilson. I know what you are thinking... "I don't believe it!" The movie was well written and flows along nicely. I will give this film 6 out of 10. Not as funny as it could have been, but still a good film.

    Maybe this was not one of the best movies, or best loved movies(I noticed it lost quite a bit at the box office), but I laughed almost all the way through this. Laughing, I found out early on is somewhat prohibitive in movie theaters, and of course the person next to you wants to hear what's going on. A lot is going on in this comedy, and I happened to like Joanna Whaley a lot in her French Maid. But, if you did not think the flick was all that hot itself, or anyone, an idea might be to watch the movie again and try to notice only Bill Murray. Think about it, he is acting in a movie where he assumes that he is in a contrived situation. The SNL actor is so completely believable, and his character and everybody else's character is supported by a pretty involved script. The whole comedy is worthwhile if you can watch in an unprotracted manner. I have a habit of seeing some highly acclaimed movies in parts. Yet I watched this all the way through without a break. The plot is not anything new by itself, that is the the plot the criminals have in the heart of London. But then the idea of this sort of thick but spontaneous movie rental employee being involved in there makes the picture unique.

    Bill Murray has made a lot of brilliant art, from Caddyshack to Rushmore to Lost in Translation. This, I think, is his funniest work. He plays an idiot savant who is fearless, who plays games of life and death because he thinks it's a game. What makes this whole movie seem like a high-wire act is whether Murray will discover that his life really is in danger. If he makes this discovery, his confidence will be shattered and he will fall to pieces. It's a hysterical and brilliant riff on male confidence and male delusion. It's an ode to the power of innocence. He is oblivious to all the bad in the world. He's unaware of his own vulnerability. Compare the sweaty James Bond to the cool and nonchalant Bill Murray. It's like zen for morons. It's hysterical when you watch it and brilliant when you think about it. Taylor Carmichael

    When I first heard of this movie I was intrigued by the title - it, in my own weird way, thought it was clever. It looked cute, and a few friends said that it was funny, so I could not resist watching it. One complaint though is that the video cover is not as good as the movie poster, where they had Bill Murry pointing an oversized gun out at you. The movie is about a naive man, Wallace Ritchie, who comes to London to surprise his brother, but must be occupied for the night as his brother has an important dinner. So his brother enrolls him in something called the theatre of life, where the audience participates in the action. Unfortunately Wallace picks up the wrong phone call and gets caught up in a cloak and dagger mission, which he believes is all acting. The comedy from this movie comes from two areas: in one way it is slap-stick, but the real thrust of the comedy is the fact the people do not know something, yet assume that they do. They do not know who Wallace is and think that he is a dangerous spy, yet he is just an ordinary guy. What adds to it is that Wallace was mugged at the beginning so he has no identification, yet they think even more that he is a spy. What is even funnier is that Wallace thinks he is simply in an interactive theatre, and treats it as such. While all of this seriousness goes on around him, he seems to be having the time of his life. Even more, Ritchie's clumsiness gets him out of a lot of predicaments and makes the bad guys think even more that he is a dangerous spy. I really enjoyed this movie. Most comedies I do not find funny, but once in a while one comes out that is quite funny (though some are simply pure hilarity, such as Analyse This!). This is a humorous (though not outrageously funny) comedy.

    THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE Well... this is not as good as I was hoping it was going to be, but I still enjoyed it. This comedy stars the legendary Bill Murray, which is the reason I watched it. The movie is about an American who comes to the UK to visit his brother, but he comes on a bad day so his brother pays for him to act in a reality show that night playing out some kind of adventure. The problem is, he goes on the wrong adventure, and the things that are happening to him are all real, but he doesn't realise it. There are some funny bits in it... I love the scene where Bill gets mugged but he thinks it is all part of the act and plays along. There were not too many laugh out loud moments, but the film was still very amusing. The casting was good, but the acting was questionable. But this is a spoof, so we can't expect any fantastic acting. It was what was expected really. The film stars Bill Murray as mentioned before, Peter Gallagher, Joanne Whalley & Mr. Victor Meldrew himself... Richard Wilson. I know what you are thinking... "I don't believe it!" The movie was well written and flows along nicely. I will give this film 6 out of 10. Not as funny as it could have been, but still a good film.

    The Man Who Knew Too Little is an alright movie with a surprisingly clever story line and a great performance from Bill Murray,but a lot of the humor is very hit and miss,and probably misses more commonly than it hits,although I will admit when it does hit it is very funny.I was very confused watching this movie who the target audience was,because a lot of the humor was very childish,but what happens in the movie and a lot of scenes aren't very suitable for children,its probably meant for the family,but I would advise any overprotective parent to view this movie before viewing it with their children. Wallace Ritchie (Bill Murray) gets involved with spy's who are assassinating a private event,but Wallace thinks it is all a theater act and must stay in character.

    Peter Gallagher is an ambitious businessman in London, trying to put together a big international deal to market his product. He invites his goofy brother, Murray, over as a guest and tells him he'll be taking part in "The Theater of Life," which will consist of a series of auditions and improvised incidents that may lead to a part in a play. Something like that. It's like Michael Douglas' "The Game" turned inside out. This is a fantasy, built around a single joke -- Murray's belief that it's all part of a game. He continues to believe it throughout the movie, even to the end. The first inopportune occurrences are minor ones. Two British thugs attempt to rob him at knife point. Murray responds by chuckling and complimenting them on their ability to really get into the role. Then he's swept up coincidentally into a plot by British and Russian agents who long for the good old days of the Cold War, when all the spies were busy and the phones rang all the time. They plan to assassinate the Russian and British leaders who are about to sign a Friendship Pact. Murray is misidentified as a secret agent assigned to stop them. The contretemps pile up, one upon the other, and Murray blindly stumbles through it all. If a pistol appears, he's likely to say something like, "Uh-oh, a sign of realism, eh? Very impressive. No, really." The caricature of reality resembles that of Peter Sellers' "Being There," the story of an almost infinitely stupid ex-gardener who only knows what he's seen on television but is taken to be a Deep Thinker and winds up being considered for nomination for the President of the United States. "Being There" had its silly moments but was funnier because the lines were better and because it carried a certain sting with it. How stupid can you be before you are recognized as less than presidential material? Here, the jokes involve much more slapstick and the misguided premise itself is sort of worn out by the end. Murray winds up at a big party, dressed as a Russian dancer, jiggling a live bomb. The writers kept forging ahead although the story was going nowhere. Not that it doesn't have its share of laughs. I'm not sure the writers realized it but they've introduced a kind of psychological approach to therapy based on the "life as theater" model. There's no place to get into role playing. Anyone interested should Google Milton Erikson. I'll give an example of how taken-for-granted the scrips that we live are. It's a real example. A Los Angeles police officer pulled over a driver for a minor violation. The driver was African-American and it was a black neighborhood. As the cop examined the driver's credentials and busied himself with writing a ticket, a crowd gathered, slowly growing angrier at yet more police harassment of blacks. Soon the lone cop was surrounded by a muttering mob and the threat of violence hung in the air. The script at this point called for the cop to unclip his revolver and order the crowd to disperse. Instead, he turned and waved a copy of the traffic ticket above his head, shouting, "You have just witnessed an exercise of law enforcement in the city of Los Angeles!" While the crowd puzzled over this announcement ("What did he say?"), the officer got into his car and drove quietly away. Neither Murray nor anyone else knew quite was they were tapping into when they casually threw around terms like "Living Theater" and "Life as Theater." It really IS, in many ways. For more of THAT, read Kenneth Burke or Erving Goffman.

    The Man Who Knew Too Little is a movie based on a book by Robert Farrar, and it's one of those timeless comedies with phenomenal script and even better acting. I must say that Bill Murray was hilarious in this one, and this is one of his best comedic roles. The script is very original and unique, giving the director and actors enough material to create a comedy that has several layers and can be viewed as classical slapstick but also an intelligent comedy. Combining a serious spy plot with a hapless and accident-prone "secret agent" is something that now is quite popular, but back in 1997 was a genre less explored. Toying with the cold war, and stereotypes common for James Bond movies Farrar creates even more comedy, and a perfect example is Boris The Butcher, played masterfully by Alfred Mollina. Wallace Ritchie is a manager at a Blockbuster video store in America, and he has come to England to visit his businessman brother James. But this is a wrong time for a visit since James is expecting an important business partner at his house so he offers Ritchie a ticket to "Theater Of Life" a new kind of show where a viewer participates along with the actors in a show. All too happy, Ritchie accepts the offer, not knowing that soon he will be involved in a spy war of immense proportions. Thinking that this is still a show and that everything is supposed to happen like that Ritchie plays along, as he tries to save the world in his world and in real world...

    A Bill Murray vehicle which is all over the road. Pee Wee Herman would have made a better secret agent. The writers pulled out all the B movie plots to write this. Bill Murray "Secret Agent" in London, falls into a "secret plot" to kill some Prime Minister.A Call girl to the British Defense Minister has "secret letters" that means absolutely nothing to anyone. Russian "secret" agents grab Murray and hold him for something.Scotland yard is looking for Bill Murray who are as competent as Pee Wee Herman finding his Bicycle at the Alamo.The British Secret Service agents are older then the Queen. There is a summit between Russian,British,German,American Embassadors and absolutely no security at a Hotel in London. Meanwhile Russian agents want to torture Bill Murray for some unknown and stupid reason kind of like the three stooges.Anyway an old Gezzer couple dressed in leather are performing S&M acts,absolutely hideous script.What moron wrote this movie. ?Why would any good actor agree to appear in this movie.It states that it cost $20,000,000 to make this movie. unless I read this wrong.It grossed like $10,000,000 worldwide.

    The Man Who Knew Too Little (1997) There are those who think Bill Murray can do no wrong, that he has an impeccable comic flair and intelligence that drive even mediocre fare. And I'm one of them. And this is relatively humdrum stuff on one level--though the basic idea of spoofing a spy superstar is as old and reliable as James Bond himself. (I mean, Bond spoofs were around when Sean Connery was still 007.) And the writing is really very witty here, giving two prongs forward in this mostly funny, always fast affair. That is--I laughed a lot! That's the goal. The cold war themes of the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. going head to head were old even in 1997 but of course not old for James Bond, and this does harken back somehow to the original. Murray plays a classic type--the hero who succeeds by accident. Often, it's the absurdity and illogic of this odd hero that makes him successful, surprising the professionals and seeming brazen and original. And so he is. The plot is simple--some bad guys have a bomb that's going to go off in five hours. We know that at the start, and so the rest is loaded with anticipation and dread as the deadline nears. We also know (in this sort of movie) that no harm will come to Murray's cheerful, doltish American type. So the race against the clock is a series of gags and spoofs and lucky twists, all good for laughs. Murray is the key to it all, playing the naive participant with that uncanny timing and innocent face too well, over and over. If it were only about Murry this would be a 10 star masterpiece. The rest of the cast, and the eventual inevitability of the plot, hold it back, though. So it is what it is, still a great romp. You want more than that? You won't get it. But why would you? Enjoy.

    This is one enjoyable comedy for sure. "A" for that script. It managed to create a long chain of nice misunderstandings, including the many double-meaning words. And I liked intensifying all the hot events in about 2 hours of one night. The thing about the anti-James Bond is that he represents us; all the clumsy wanna-be heroes out there. So when the movie celebrates his always accidental victory, winning the respect and the fear from everybody, we feel so relieved, turning into heroes ourselves, since one of us DID IT, and purely by his / our clumsiness, to leave the movie a bit proud of our low capacities and sheer innocence, believing  even if spuriously  that someday we'll save the world as much as god is on our side, and some scriptwriters as well ! However, the script forgot to explain what the fact around the woman / the minster's mistress was ? What the need for those letters could be ? And I thought the relationship between the lead and his brother could have been rooted better, to present some kind of a meaning at last, concerning the importance of being careless and adventurous more than uptight and narrow-minded. Speaking about "careless" pushes immediately to (Bill Murray). I love such a guy. He plays everything with a trademark sweet coolness. Look at him fooling around as a Russian dancer who, by his axiomatic fun, excels the rest of the serious authentic dancers. No one I remember can do such a scene with a serene lovely sense but (Murray). He's the easygoing friend that everybody wishes for. So, another "A" for the lead actor. The minor parts weren't done as good. I mean (Peter Gallagher) as the brother ?! Where was (Jon Lovitz) for god's sake ? Then (Joanne Whalley) ?? She's totally miscast. I don't know how they didn't come up with any funny, any sexy other actress ?! It's only (Alfred Molina) who was great as the professional "butcher"; with the double meaning of the word ! The movie suffers from a small size budget. With another sum of money this should have been more powerful and dazzling. And (Jon Amiel)'s direction didn't help much mastering a powerful and dazzling image in the first place. Well, this is a kind of James Bond spoof, so be at least a bit big or colorful instead of looking like something shot in a very tight rooms ! This is dazzling at heart movie. Because outwardly it's near to poor TV. But anyway, with that script and that lead, not much can go wrong.

All too happy, Ritchie accepts the offer, not knowing that soon he will be involved in a spy war of immense proportions. Thinking that this is still a show and that everything is supposed to happen like that Ritchie plays along, as he tries to save the world in his world and in real world...

    A Bill Murray vehicle which is all over the road. Pee Wee Herman would have made a better secret agent. The writers pulled out all the B movie plots to write this. Bill Murray "Secret Agent" in London, falls into a "secret plot" to kill some Prime Minister.A Call girl to the British Defense Minister has "secret letters" that means absolutely nothing to anyone. Russian "secret" agents grab Murray and hold him for something.Scotland yard is looking for Bill Murray who are as competent as Pee Wee Herman finding his Bicycle at the Alamo.The British Secret Service agents are older then the Queen. There is a summit between Russian,British,German,American Embassadors and absolutely no security at a Hotel in London. Meanwhile Russian agents want to torture Bill Murray for some unknown and stupid reason kind of like the three stooges.Anyway an old Gezzer couple dressed in leather are performing S&M acts,absolutely hideous script.What moron wrote this movie. ?Why would any good actor agree to appear in this movie.It states that it cost $20,000,000 to make this movie. unless I read this wrong.It grossed like $10,000,000 worldwide.

    The Man Who Knew Too Little (1997) There are those who think Bill Murray can do no wrong, that he has an impeccable comic flair and intelligence that drive even mediocre fare. And I'm one of them. And this is relatively humdrum stuff on one level--though the basic idea of spoofing a spy superstar is as old and reliable as James Bond himself. (I mean, Bond spoofs were around when Sean Connery was still 007.) And the writing is really very witty here, giving two prongs forward in this mostly funny, always fast affair. That is--I laughed a lot! That's the goal. The cold war themes of the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. going head to head were old even in 1997 but of course not old for James Bond, and this does harken back somehow to the original. Murray plays a classic type--the hero who succeeds by accident. Often, it's the absurdity and illogic of this odd hero that makes him successful, surprising the professionals and seeming brazen and original. And so he is. The plot is simple--some bad guys have a bomb that's going to go off in five hours. We know that at the start, and so the rest is loaded with anticipation and dread as the deadline nears. We also know (in this sort of movie) that no harm will come to Murray's cheerful, doltish American type. So the race against the clock is a series of gags and spoofs and lucky twists, all good for laughs. Murray is the key to it all, playing the naive participant with that uncanny timing and innocent face too well, over and over. If it were only about Murry this would be a 10 star masterpiece. The rest of the cast, and the eventual inevitability of the plot, hold it back, though. So it is what it is, still a great romp. You want more than that? You won't get it. But why would you? Enjoy.

    This is one enjoyable comedy for sure. "A" for that script. It managed to create a long chain of nice misunderstandings, including the many double-meaning words. And I liked intensifying all the hot events in about 2 hours of one night. The thing about the anti-James Bond is that he represents us; all the clumsy wanna-be heroes out there. So when the movie celebrates his always accidental victory, winning the respect and the fear from everybody, we feel so relieved, turning into heroes ourselves, since one of us DID IT, and purely by his / our clumsiness, to leave the movie a bit proud of our low capacities and sheer innocence, believing  even if spuriously  that someday we'll save the world as much as god is on our side, and some scriptwriters as well ! However, the script forgot to explain what the fact around the woman / the minster's mistress was ? What the need for those letters could be ? And I thought the relationship between the lead and his brother could have been rooted better, to present some kind of a meaning at last, concerning the importance of being careless and adventurous more than uptight and narrow-minded. Speaking about "careless" pushes immediately to (Bill Murray). I love such a guy. He plays everything with a trademark sweet coolness. Look at him fooling around as a Russian dancer who, by his axiomatic fun, excels the rest of the serious authentic dancers. No one I remember can do such a scene with a serene lovely sense but (Murray). He's the easygoing friend that everybody wishes for. So, another "A" for the lead actor. The minor parts weren't done as good. I mean (Peter Gallagher) as the brother ?! Where was (Jon Lovitz) for god's sake ? Then (Joanne Whalley) ?? She's totally miscast. I don't know how they didn't come up with any funny, any sexy other actress ?! It's only (Alfred Molina) who was great as the professional "butcher"; with the double meaning of the word ! The movie suffers from a small size budget. With another sum of money this should have been more powerful and dazzling. And (Jon Amiel)'s direction didn't help much mastering a powerful and dazzling image in the first place. Well, this is a kind of James Bond spoof, so be at least a bit big or colorful instead of looking like something shot in a very tight rooms ! This is dazzling at heart movie. Because outwardly it's near to poor TV. But anyway, with that script and that lead, not much can go wrong.

    Maybe this was not one of the best movies, or best loved movies(I noticed it lost quite a bit at the box office), but I laughed almost all the way through this. Laughing, I found out early on is somewhat prohibitive in movie theaters, and of course the person next to you wants to hear what's going on. A lot is going on in this comedy, and I happened to like Joanna Whaley a lot in her French Maid. But, if you did not think the flick was all that hot itself, or anyone, an idea might be to watch the movie again and try to notice only Bill Murray. Think about it, he is acting in a movie where he assumes that he is in a contrived situation. The SNL actor is so completely believable, and his character and everybody else's character is supported by a pretty involved script. The whole comedy is worthwhile if you can watch in an unprotracted manner. I have a habit of seeing some highly acclaimed movies in parts. Yet I watched this all the way through without a break. The plot is not anything new by itself, that is the the plot the criminals have in the heart of London. But then the idea of this sort of thick but spontaneous movie rental employee being involved in there makes the picture unique.

    Bill Murray has made a lot of brilliant art, from Caddyshack to Rushmore to Lost in Translation. This, I think, is his funniest work. He plays an idiot savant who is fearless, who plays games of life and death because he thinks it's a game. What makes this whole movie seem like a high-wire act is whether Murray will discover that his life really is in danger. If he makes this discovery, his confidence will be shattered and he will fall to pieces. It's a hysterical and brilliant riff on male confidence and male delusion. It's an ode to the power of innocence. He is oblivious to all the bad in the world. He's unaware of his own vulnerability. Compare the sweaty James Bond to the cool and nonchalant Bill Murray. It's like zen for morons. It's hysterical when you watch it and brilliant when you think about it. Taylor Carmichael

    When I first heard of this movie I was intrigued by the title - it, in my own weird way, thought it was clever. It looked cute, and a few friends said that it was funny, so I could not resist watching it. One complaint though is that the video cover is not as good as the movie poster, where they had Bill Murry pointing an oversized gun out at you. The movie is about a naive man, Wallace Ritchie, who comes to London to surprise his brother, but must be occupied for the night as his brother has an important dinner. So his brother enrolls him in something called the theatre of life, where the audience participates in the action. Unfortunately Wallace picks up the wrong phone call and gets caught up in a cloak and dagger mission, which he believes is all acting. The comedy from this movie comes from two areas: in one way it is slap-stick, but the real thrust of the comedy is the fact the people do not know something, yet assume that they do. They do not know who Wallace is and think that he is a dangerous spy, yet he is just an ordinary guy. What adds to it is that Wallace was mugged at the beginning so he has no identification, yet they think even more that he is a spy. What is even funnier is that Wallace thinks he is simply in an interactive theatre, and treats it as such. While all of this seriousness goes on around him, he seems to be having the time of his life. Even more, Ritchie's clumsiness gets him out of a lot of predicaments and makes the bad guys think even more that he is a dangerous spy. I really enjoyed this movie. Most comedies I do not find funny, but once in a while one comes out that is quite funny (though some are simply pure hilarity, such as Analyse This!). This is a humorous (though not outrageously funny) comedy.

    THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE Well... this is not as good as I was hoping it was going to be, but I still enjoyed it. This comedy stars the legendary Bill Murray, which is the reason I watched it. The movie is about an American who comes to the UK to visit his brother, but he comes on a bad day so his brother pays for him to act in a reality show that night playing out some kind of adventure. The problem is, he goes on the wrong adventure, and the things that are happening to him are all real, but he doesn't realise it. There are some funny bits in it... I love the scene where Bill gets mugged but he thinks it is all part of the act and plays along. There were not too many laugh out loud moments, but the film was still very amusing. The casting was good, but the acting was questionable. But this is a spoof, so we can't expect any fantastic acting. It was what was expected really. The film stars Bill Murray as mentioned before, Peter Gallagher, Joanne Whalley & Mr. Victor Meldrew himself... Richard Wilson. I know what you are thinking... "I don't believe it!" The movie was well written and flows along nicely. I will give this film 6 out of 10. Not as funny as it could have been, but still a good film.

    The Man Who Knew Too Little is an alright movie with a surprisingly clever story line and a great performance from Bill Murray,but a lot of the humor is very hit and miss,and probably misses more commonly than it hits,although I will admit when it does hit it is very funny.I was very confused watching this movie who the target audience was,because a lot of the humor was very childish,but what happens in the movie and a lot of scenes aren't very suitable for children,its probably meant for the family,but I would advise any overprotective parent to view this movie before viewing it with their children. Wallace Ritchie (Bill Murray) gets involved with spy's who are assassinating a private event,but Wallace thinks it is all a theater act and must stay in character.

    Peter Gallagher is an ambitious businessman in London, trying to put together a big international deal to market his product. He invites his goofy brother, Murray, over as a guest and tells him he'll be taking part in "The Theater of Life," which will consist of a series of auditions and improvised incidents that may lead to a part in a play. Something like that. It's like Michael Douglas' "The Game" turned inside out. This is a fantasy, built around a single joke -- Murray's belief that it's all part of a game. He continues to believe it throughout the movie, even to the end. The first inopportune occurrences are minor ones. Two British thugs attempt to rob him at knife point. Murray responds by chuckling and complimenting them on their ability to really get into the role. Then he's swept up coincidentally into a plot by British and Russian agents who long for the good old days of the Cold War, when all the spies were busy and the phones rang all the time. They plan to assassinate the Russian and British leaders who are about to sign a Friendship Pact. Murray is misidentified as a secret agent assigned to stop them. The contretemps pile up, one upon the other, and Murray blindly stumbles through it all. If a pistol appears, he's likely to say something like, "Uh-oh, a sign of realism, eh? Very impressive. No, really." The caricature of reality resembles that of Peter Sellers' "Being There," the story of an almost infinitely stupid ex-gardener who only knows what he's seen on television but is taken to be a Deep Thinker and winds up being considered for nomination for the President of the United States. "Being There" had its silly moments but was funnier because the lines were better and because it carried a certain sting with it. How stupid can you be before you are recognized as less than presidential material? Here, the jokes involve much more slapstick and the misguided premise itself is sort of worn out by the end. Murray winds up at a big party, dressed as a Russian dancer, jiggling a live bomb. The writers kept forging ahead although the story was going nowhere. Not that it doesn't have its share of laughs. I'm not sure the writers realized it but they've introduced a kind of psychological approach to therapy based on the "life as theater" model. There's no place to get into role playing. Anyone interested should Google Milton Erikson. I'll give an example of how taken-for-granted the scrips that we live are. It's a real example. A Los Angeles police officer pulled over a driver for a minor violation. The driver was African-American and it was a black neighborhood. As the cop examined the driver's credentials and busied himself with writing a ticket, a crowd gathered, slowly growing angrier at yet more police harassment of blacks. Soon the lone cop was surrounded by a muttering mob and the threat of violence hung in the air. The script at this point called for the cop to unclip his revolver and order the crowd to disperse. Instead, he turned and waved a copy of the traffic ticket above his head, shouting, "You have just witnessed an exercise of law enforcement in the city of Los Angeles!" While the crowd puzzled over this announcement ("What did he say?"), the officer got into his car and drove quietly away. Neither Murray nor anyone else knew quite was they were tapping into when they casually threw around terms like "Living Theater" and "Life as Theater." It really IS, in many ways. For more of THAT, read Kenneth Burke or Erving Goffman.

    The Man Who Knew Too Little is a movie based on a book by Robert Farrar, and it's one of those timeless comedies with phenomenal script and even better acting. I must say that Bill Murray was hilarious in this one, and this is one of his best comedic roles. The script is very original and unique, giving the director and actors enough material to create a comedy that has several layers and can be viewed as classical slapstick but also an intelligent comedy. Combining a serious spy plot with a hapless and accident-prone "secret agent" is something that now is quite popular, but back in 1997 was a genre less explored. Toying with the cold war, and stereotypes common for James Bond movies Farrar creates even more comedy, and a perfect example is Boris The Butcher, played masterfully by Alfred Mollina. Wallace Ritchie is a manager at a Blockbuster video store in America, and he has come to England to visit his businessman brother James. But this is a wrong time for a visit since James is expecting an important business partner at his house so he offers Ritchie a ticket to "Theater Of Life" a new kind of show where a viewer participates along with the actors in a show. All too happy, Ritchie accepts the offer, not knowing that soon he will be involved in a spy war of immense proportions. Thinking that this is still a show and that everything is supposed to happen like that Ritchie plays along, as he tries to save the world in his world and in real world...

I love the scene where Bill gets mugged but he thinks it is all part of the act and plays along. There were not too many laugh out loud moments, but the film was still very amusing. The casting was good, but the acting was questionable. But this is a spoof, so we can't expect any fantastic acting. It was what was expected really. The film stars Bill Murray as mentioned before, Peter Gallagher, Joanne Whalley & Mr. Victor Meldrew himself... Richard Wilson. I know what you are thinking... "I don't believe it!" The movie was well written and flows along nicely. I will give this film 6 out of 10. Not as funny as it could have been, but still a good film.

    The Man Who Knew Too Little is an alright movie with a surprisingly clever story line and a great performance from Bill Murray,but a lot of the humor is very hit and miss,and probably misses more commonly than it hits,although I will admit when it does hit it is very funny.I was very confused watching this movie who the target audience was,because a lot of the humor was very childish,but what happens in the movie and a lot of scenes aren't very suitable for children,its probably meant for the family,but I would advise any overprotective parent to view this movie before viewing it with their children. Wallace Ritchie (Bill Murray) gets involved with spy's who are assassinating a private event,but Wallace thinks it is all a theater act and must stay in character.

    Peter Gallagher is an ambitious businessman in London, trying to put together a big international deal to market his product. He invites his goofy brother, Murray, over as a guest and tells him he'll be taking part in "The Theater of Life," which will consist of a series of auditions and improvised incidents that may lead to a part in a play. Something like that. It's like Michael Douglas' "The Game" turned inside out. This is a fantasy, built around a single joke -- Murray's belief that it's all part of a game. He continues to believe it throughout the movie, even to the end. The first inopportune occurrences are minor ones. Two British thugs attempt to rob him at knife point. Murray responds by chuckling and complimenting them on their ability to really get into the role. Then he's swept up coincidentally into a plot by British and Russian agents who long for the good old days of the Cold War, when all the spies were busy and the phones rang all the time. They plan to assassinate the Russian and British leaders who are about to sign a Friendship Pact. Murray is misidentified as a secret agent assigned to stop them. The contretemps pile up, one upon the other, and Murray blindly stumbles through it all. If a pistol appears, he's likely to say something like, "Uh-oh, a sign of realism, eh? Very impressive. No, really." The caricature of reality resembles that of Peter Sellers' "Being There," the story of an almost infinitely stupid ex-gardener who only knows what he's seen on television but is taken to be a Deep Thinker and winds up being considered for nomination for the President of the United States. "Being There" had its silly moments but was funnier because the lines were better and because it carried a certain sting with it. How stupid can you be before you are recognized as less than presidential material? Here, the jokes involve much more slapstick and the misguided premise itself is sort of worn out by the end. Murray winds up at a big party, dressed as a Russian dancer, jiggling a live bomb. The writers kept forging ahead although the story was going nowhere. Not that it doesn't have its share of laughs. I'm not sure the writers realized it but they've introduced a kind of psychological approach to therapy based on the "life as theater" model. There's no place to get into role playing. Anyone interested should Google Milton Erikson. I'll give an example of how taken-for-granted the scrips that we live are. It's a real example. A Los Angeles police officer pulled over a driver for a minor violation. The driver was African-American and it was a black neighborhood. As the cop examined the driver's credentials and busied himself with writing a ticket, a crowd gathered, slowly growing angrier at yet more police harassment of blacks. Soon the lone cop was surrounded by a muttering mob and the threat of violence hung in the air. The script at this point called for the cop to unclip his revolver and order the crowd to disperse. Instead, he turned and waved a copy of the traffic ticket above his head, shouting, "You have just witnessed an exercise of law enforcement in the city of Los Angeles!" While the crowd puzzled over this announcement ("What did he say?"), the officer got into his car and drove quietly away. Neither Murray nor anyone else knew quite was they were tapping into when they casually threw around terms like "Living Theater" and "Life as Theater." It really IS, in many ways. For more of THAT, read Kenneth Burke or Erving Goffman.

    The Man Who Knew Too Little is a movie based on a book by Robert Farrar, and it's one of those timeless comedies with phenomenal script and even better acting. I must say that Bill Murray was hilarious in this one, and this is one of his best comedic roles. The script is very original and unique, giving the director and actors enough material to create a comedy that has several layers and can be viewed as classical slapstick but also an intelligent comedy. Combining a serious spy plot with a hapless and accident-prone "secret agent" is something that now is quite popular, but back in 1997 was a genre less explored. Toying with the cold war, and stereotypes common for James Bond movies Farrar creates even more comedy, and a perfect example is Boris The Butcher, played masterfully by Alfred Mollina. Wallace Ritchie is a manager at a Blockbuster video store in America, and he has come to England to visit his businessman brother James. But this is a wrong time for a visit since James is expecting an important business partner at his house so he offers Ritchie a ticket to "Theater Of Life" a new kind of show where a viewer participates along with the actors in a show. All too happy, Ritchie accepts the offer, not knowing that soon he will be involved in a spy war of immense proportions. Thinking that this is still a show and that everything is supposed to happen like that Ritchie plays along, as he tries to save the world in his world and in real world...

    A Bill Murray vehicle which is all over the road. Pee Wee Herman would have made a better secret agent. The writers pulled out all the B movie plots to write this. Bill Murray "Secret Agent" in London, falls into a "secret plot" to kill some Prime Minister.A Call girl to the British Defense Minister has "secret letters" that means absolutely nothing to anyone. Russian "secret" agents grab Murray and hold him for something.Scotland yard is looking for Bill Murray who are as competent as Pee Wee Herman finding his Bicycle at the Alamo.The British Secret Service agents are older then the Queen. There is a summit between Russian,British,German,American Embassadors and absolutely no security at a Hotel in London. Meanwhile Russian agents want to torture Bill Murray for some unknown and stupid reason kind of like the three stooges.Anyway an old Gezzer couple dressed in leather are performing S&M acts,absolutely hideous script.What moron wrote this movie. ?Why would any good actor agree to appear in this movie.It states that it cost $20,000,000 to make this movie. unless I read this wrong.It grossed like $10,000,000 worldwide.

    The Man Who Knew Too Little (1997) There are those who think Bill Murray can do no wrong, that he has an impeccable comic flair and intelligence that drive even mediocre fare. And I'm one of them. And this is relatively humdrum stuff on one level--though the basic idea of spoofing a spy superstar is as old and reliable as James Bond himself. (I mean, Bond spoofs were around when Sean Connery was still 007.) And the writing is really very witty here, giving two prongs forward in this mostly funny, always fast affair. That is--I laughed a lot! That's the goal. The cold war themes of the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. going head to head were old even in 1997 but of course not old for James Bond, and this does harken back somehow to the original. Murray plays a classic type--the hero who succeeds by accident. Often, it's the absurdity and illogic of this odd hero that makes him successful, surprising the professionals and seeming brazen and original. And so he is. The plot is simple--some bad guys have a bomb that's going to go off in five hours. We know that at the start, and so the rest is loaded with anticipation and dread as the deadline nears. We also know (in this sort of movie) that no harm will come to Murray's cheerful, doltish American type. So the race against the clock is a series of gags and spoofs and lucky twists, all good for laughs. Murray is the key to it all, playing the naive participant with that uncanny timing and innocent face too well, over and over. If it were only about Murry this would be a 10 star masterpiece. The rest of the cast, and the eventual inevitability of the plot, hold it back, though. So it is what it is, still a great romp. You want more than that? You won't get it. But why would you? Enjoy.

    This is one enjoyable comedy for sure. "A" for that script. It managed to create a long chain of nice misunderstandings, including the many double-meaning words. And I liked intensifying all the hot events in about 2 hours of one night. The thing about the anti-James Bond is that he represents us; all the clumsy wanna-be heroes out there. So when the movie celebrates his always accidental victory, winning the respect and the fear from everybody, we feel so relieved, turning into heroes ourselves, since one of us DID IT, and purely by his / our clumsiness, to leave the movie a bit proud of our low capacities and sheer innocence, believing  even if spuriously  that someday we'll save the world as much as god is on our side, and some scriptwriters as well ! However, the script forgot to explain what the fact around the woman / the minster's mistress was ? What the need for those letters could be ? And I thought the relationship between the lead and his brother could have been rooted better, to present some kind of a meaning at last, concerning the importance of being careless and adventurous more than uptight and narrow-minded. Speaking about "careless" pushes immediately to (Bill Murray). I love such a guy. He plays everything with a trademark sweet coolness. Look at him fooling around as a Russian dancer who, by his axiomatic fun, excels the rest of the serious authentic dancers. No one I remember can do such a scene with a serene lovely sense but (Murray). He's the easygoing friend that everybody wishes for. So, another "A" for the lead actor. The minor parts weren't done as good. I mean (Peter Gallagher) as the brother ?! Where was (Jon Lovitz) for god's sake ? Then (Joanne Whalley) ?? She's totally miscast. I don't know how they didn't come up with any funny, any sexy other actress ?! It's only (Alfred Molina) who was great as the professional "butcher"; with the double meaning of the word ! The movie suffers from a small size budget. With another sum of money this should have been more powerful and dazzling. And (Jon Amiel)'s direction didn't help much mastering a powerful and dazzling image in the first place. Well, this is a kind of James Bond spoof, so be at least a bit big or colorful instead of looking like something shot in a very tight rooms ! This is dazzling at heart movie. Because outwardly it's near to poor TV. But anyway, with that script and that lead, not much can go wrong.

    Maybe this was not one of the best movies, or best loved movies(I noticed it lost quite a bit at the box office), but I laughed almost all the way through this. Laughing, I found out early on is somewhat prohibitive in movie theaters, and of course the person next to you wants to hear what's going on. A lot is going on in this comedy, and I happened to like Joanna Whaley a lot in her French Maid. But, if you did not think the flick was all that hot itself, or anyone, an idea might be to watch the movie again and try to notice only Bill Murray. Think about it, he is acting in a movie where he assumes that he is in a contrived situation. The SNL actor is so completely believable, and his character and everybody else's character is supported by a pretty involved script. The whole comedy is worthwhile if you can watch in an unprotracted manner. I have a habit of seeing some highly acclaimed movies in parts. Yet I watched this all the way through without a break. The plot is not anything new by itself, that is the the plot the criminals have in the heart of London. But then the idea of this sort of thick but spontaneous movie rental employee being involved in there makes the picture unique.

    Bill Murray has made a lot of brilliant art, from Caddyshack to Rushmore to Lost in Translation. This, I think, is his funniest work. He plays an idiot savant who is fearless, who plays games of life and death because he thinks it's a game. What makes this whole movie seem like a high-wire act is whether Murray will discover that his life really is in danger. If he makes this discovery, his confidence will be shattered and he will fall to pieces. It's a hysterical and brilliant riff on male confidence and male delusion. It's an ode to the power of innocence. He is oblivious to all the bad in the world. He's unaware of his own vulnerability. Compare the sweaty James Bond to the cool and nonchalant Bill Murray. It's like zen for morons. It's hysterical when you watch it and brilliant when you think about it. Taylor Carmichael

    When I first heard of this movie I was intrigued by the title - it, in my own weird way, thought it was clever. It looked cute, and a few friends said that it was funny, so I could not resist watching it. One complaint though is that the video cover is not as good as the movie poster, where they had Bill Murry pointing an oversized gun out at you. The movie is about a naive man, Wallace Ritchie, who comes to London to surprise his brother, but must be occupied for the night as his brother has an important dinner. So his brother enrolls him in something called the theatre of life, where the audience participates in the action. Unfortunately Wallace picks up the wrong phone call and gets caught up in a cloak and dagger mission, which he believes is all acting. The comedy from this movie comes from two areas: in one way it is slap-stick, but the real thrust of the comedy is the fact the people do not know something, yet assume that they do. They do not know who Wallace is and think that he is a dangerous spy, yet he is just an ordinary guy. What adds to it is that Wallace was mugged at the beginning so he has no identification, yet they think even more that he is a spy. What is even funnier is that Wallace thinks he is simply in an interactive theatre, and treats it as such. While all of this seriousness goes on around him, he seems to be having the time of his life. Even more, Ritchie's clumsiness gets him out of a lot of predicaments and makes the bad guys think even more that he is a dangerous spy. I really enjoyed this movie. Most comedies I do not find funny, but once in a while one comes out that is quite funny (though some are simply pure hilarity, such as Analyse This!). This is a humorous (though not outrageously funny) comedy.

    THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE Well... this is not as good as I was hoping it was going to be, but I still enjoyed it. This comedy stars the legendary Bill Murray, which is the reason I watched it. The movie is about an American who comes to the UK to visit his brother, but he comes on a bad day so his brother pays for him to act in a reality show that night playing out some kind of adventure. The problem is, he goes on the wrong adventure, and the things that are happening to him are all real, but he doesn't realise it. There are some funny bits in it... I love the scene where Bill gets mugged but he thinks it is all part of the act and plays along. There were not too many laugh out loud moments, but the film was still very amusing. The casting was good, but the acting was questionable. But this is a spoof, so we can't expect any fantastic acting. It was what was expected really. The film stars Bill Murray as mentioned before, Peter Gallagher, Joanne Whalley & Mr. Victor Meldrew himself... Richard Wilson. I know what you are thinking... "I don't believe it!" The movie was well written and flows along nicely. I will give this film 6 out of 10. Not as funny as it could have been, but still a good film.

Speaking about "careless" pushes immediately to (Bill Murray). I love such a guy. He plays everything with a trademark sweet coolness. Look at him fooling around as a Russian dancer who, by his axiomatic fun, excels the rest of the serious authentic dancers. No one I remember can do such a scene with a serene lovely sense but (Murray). He's the easygoing friend that everybody wishes for. So, another "A" for the lead actor. The minor parts weren't done as good. I mean (Peter Gallagher) as the brother ?! Where was (Jon Lovitz) for god's sake ? Then (Joanne Whalley) ?? She's totally miscast. I don't know how they didn't come up with any funny, any sexy other actress ?! It's only (Alfred Molina) who was great as the professional "butcher"; with the double meaning of the word ! The movie suffers from a small size budget. With another sum of money this should have been more powerful and dazzling. And (Jon Amiel)'s direction didn't help much mastering a powerful and dazzling image in the first place. Well, this is a kind of James Bond spoof, so be at least a bit big or colorful instead of looking like something shot in a very tight rooms ! This is dazzling at heart movie. Because outwardly it's near to poor TV. But anyway, with that script and that lead, not much can go wrong.

    Maybe this was not one of the best movies, or best loved movies(I noticed it lost quite a bit at the box office), but I laughed almost all the way through this. Laughing, I found out early on is somewhat prohibitive in movie theaters, and of course the person next to you wants to hear what's going on. A lot is going on in this comedy, and I happened to like Joanna Whaley a lot in her French Maid. But, if you did not think the flick was all that hot itself, or anyone, an idea might be to watch the movie again and try to notice only Bill Murray. Think about it, he is acting in a movie where he assumes that he is in a contrived situation. The SNL actor is so completely believable, and his character and everybody else's character is supported by a pretty involved script. The whole comedy is worthwhile if you can watch in an unprotracted manner. I have a habit of seeing some highly acclaimed movies in parts. Yet I watched this all the way through without a break. The plot is not anything new by itself, that is the the plot the criminals have in the heart of London. But then the idea of this sort of thick but spontaneous movie rental employee being involved in there makes the picture unique.

    Bill Murray has made a lot of brilliant art, from Caddyshack to Rushmore to Lost in Translation. This, I think, is his funniest work. He plays an idiot savant who is fearless, who plays games of life and death because he thinks it's a game. What makes this whole movie seem like a high-wire act is whether Murray will discover that his life really is in danger. If he makes this discovery, his confidence will be shattered and he will fall to pieces. It's a hysterical and brilliant riff on male confidence and male delusion. It's an ode to the power of innocence. He is oblivious to all the bad in the world. He's unaware of his own vulnerability. Compare the sweaty James Bond to the cool and nonchalant Bill Murray. It's like zen for morons. It's hysterical when you watch it and brilliant when you think about it. Taylor Carmichael
